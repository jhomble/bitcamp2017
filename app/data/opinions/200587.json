Edward F. Harrington, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n           Lynch, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n          Michael K. Loucks, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, U.S. Attorney, and Susan G. Winkler and Gary\nS. Katzmann, Assistant U.S. Attorneys, were on brief for the United\nStates.\n\n          Matthew D. Brown, with whom Joseph P. Russoniello and\nCooley Godward LLP were on brief for Thurston.\n\n\n                           August 4, 2003\n\f               LYNCH, Circuit Judge. A jury convicted William Thurston,\n\na vice president of Damon Clinical Testing Laboratories, Inc., of\n\nconspiring to defraud the Medicare program of over five million\n\ndollars. The fraud charged involved the manipulation of physicians\n\ninto       ordering   unnecessary    ferritin   blood   tests1   for   Medicare\n\nbeneficiaries, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 (2000).\n\n               The essence of the scheme charged was that Damon, through\n\nThurston and others, bundled the ferritin blood test -- previously\n\nordered by doctors less than two percent of the time -- into a\n\npanel of blood tests known as the LabScan -- which was ordered\n\nthirty to forty percent of the time.              When doctors or patients\n\n(instead of insurers) paid for the bundled LabScan, Damon provided\n\nthe ferritin test for free, leading doctors to believe there was no\n\nextra charge for this test.            Doctors were not told that, when\n\nMedicare paid for the bundled LabScan, Medicare was charged extra\n\nfor the ferritin test.              Indeed, both a letter and marketing\n\nmaterials indicated the added ferritin test was \"free\"; that is,\n\nthat there was no charge beyond the standard LabScan charge. Those\n\nunnecessary ferritin tests were not free to Medicare.                     Damon\n\ncharged Medicare roughly $21 per ferritin test on top of the\n\napproximately $24 charged for the LabScan.              Nor were doctors told\n\nthat the ferritin test could be ordered separately; the test\n\n\n       1\n       The ferritin iron test measures the number of atoms per\nmolecule of circulating ferritin. Ferritin is a binding protein\nwhich delivers iron to iron storage cells.\n\n                                       -2-\n\frequisition form did not offer that option.                       The physicians, then,\n\nwere induced to order and to certify as medically necessary a large\n\nnumber of ferritin tests which were not medically necessary.\n\n             The government's theory was that Damon did this to offset\n\nMedicare's     1988     reduction         in    reimbursement        rates    of   sixteen\n\npercent, which was projected to cause Damon an estimated annual\n\nloss of $800,000 in revenues.              In just one of Thurston's labs, the\n\norders   for        ferritin      tests    were       expected      to     increase     from\n\napproximately three hundred per month to roughly ten thousand per\n\nmonth.   Thurston testified that he was innocent, and neither had\n\nknowledge      of    nor    responsibility            for   key    components      of    the\n\nconspiracy.     The jury disagreed.\n\n             Although the sentencing guidelines called for a sentence\n\nof   sixty-three       to    seventy-eight            months,     the    district     court\n\nsentenced Thurston to only three months' imprisonment.                          It did so\n\nby granting a downward departure to \"correct\" a perceived disparity\n\nbetween a five-year sentence of imprisonment for Thurston and the\n\nsentence of three years' probation given to the company President,\n\nJoseph Isola,         who   had    pled    nolo       contendere     and     assisted    the\n\ngovernment. Its second ground for departure was its sense that the\n\ngood   works    Thurston       did    for       his    church      and   community      were\n\nextraordinary.\n\n             This sentence outraged the prosecutors, who appealed,\n\narguing that the district court lacked the power to depart downward\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\ffor any of the reasons it gave, and that, even if a departure were\n\nappropriate, the extent of the departure was excessive.        The\n\ngovernment also appeals the district court's failure to impose a\n\nfine, on the basis that the Sentencing Guidelines, if not the\n\nstatute, mandated a fine.   Finally, the prosecution argues that if\n\nsome departure for good works was warranted, the district court was\n\nrequired to address an issue it avoided: the government's request\n\nfor an upward departure on the basis that Thurston had obstructed\n\njustice by committing perjury on the witness stand.\n\n          Thurston also appeals, arguing that the conviction must\n\nbe vacated because the prosecution was barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations, because he was entitled to a jury instruction and to\n\nacquittal on the basis that he reasonably interpreted the law to\n\nmean he could rely on the physicians' certifications of medical\n\nnecessity, and because of other errors.      In addition, Thurston\n\nargues his sentence was too high because the sentencing base\n\noffense level calculation for amount of loss, either actual or\n\nintended, was unproven and excessive.    Thurston also defends the\n\ndownward departure.\n\n          Several important issues are raised by these appeals.\n\nThe government's appeal requires us to address the effect of the\n\nnew Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of\n\nChildren Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub. L. No. 108-21, 117\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fStat. 650,2 on the standard the courts of appeals use to review\n\ndownward departure decisions by district judges in sentencing, as\n\nwell as the availability of a downward departure for a record of\n\ngood works, U.S.S.G. § 5H1.11.           Thurston's appeal invites, inter\n\nalia,     clarification      of   the    defense     doctrine    concerning    a\n\ndefendant's reasonable interpretation of the law; the issue of when\n\na statute of limitations defense must be raised; the ramifications\n\nof a trial judge's failure to respond to jury instructions proposed\n\nby counsel; the evidence needed to show an intended loss; and the\n\nquestion of whether fines are mandatory.\n\n            In   the   end   we   sustain     the   conviction   but   find   the\n\nsentence was in error.\n\n                                   I.    Facts\n\n            We state the facts as the jury could reasonably have\n\nfound them, including a fair description of the defense evidence.\n\nA.   Background\n\n            Medicare provides certain medical services and care,\n\nincluding clinical laboratory testing services, to persons aged\n\nsixty-five and older and to persons with disabilities. At the time\n\nof the conspiracy, Medicare was administered by the Health Care\n\nFinancing Administration (HCFA), a division of the U.S. Department\n\nof Health and Human Services. HCFA in turn contracted with private\n\n\n\n      2\n      This Act is also known as the Amber Alert bill. It includes\nchanges put forward in the so-called Feeney Amendment.\n\n                                        -5-\n\finsurance companies (\"carriers\" and \"intermediaries\") to handle\n\nclaims for reimbursement to Medicare program beneficiaries.                      By\n\nlaw, Medicare only reimburses clinical laboratory services if those\n\nservices were medically necessary for the treatment or diagnosis of\n\na beneficiary's illness or injury.                42 U.S.C. § 1395y(a)(1)(A)\n\n(2000); see also 42 C.F.R. § 424.10(a) (1988).                 Medicare did not\n\ngenerally reimburse screening tests.                Medicare reimbursed one-\n\nhundred percent of the cost of necessary clinical blood tests.\n\n           Damon was, at the time, a Massachusetts corporation that\n\nprovided   clinical      laboratory   testing       services    to    physicians,\n\nhospitals, health maintenance organizations, and their patients\n\nnationwide.    Approximately thirty percent of Damon's revenues were\n\nfrom Medicare.     Damon owned and operated a national system of\n\nclinical laboratories, and Damon was an approved Medicare provider.\n\nWhen Damon    billed     the    Medicare    program,   it    submitted    to     the\n\ncarriers a HCFA 1500 form saying that it certified the lab tests\n\nwere medically necessary.         Physicians did not see those bills.\n\n           Thurston served as Regional Vice President of Damon from\n\n1987 to 1990, and was responsible during all or part of this time\n\nfor Damon's regional laboratories in Newbury Park, California;\n\nPhoenix; Chicago; and San Francisco. His office was at the Newbury\n\nPark lab; he traveled to the other labs and was in regular phone\n\ncontact.      Thurston    was    promoted    to   Senior    Vice     President    of\n\nOperations in 1990.            Thereafter, he relocated to the company\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fheadquarters in Needham, Massachusetts and supervised only the San\n\nFrancisco lab.      Another company purchased Damon in August 1993;\n\nThurston later switched employers and moved to Utah.\n\nB.    Theories of Prosecution and Defense\n\n              The government's theory was that the defendants tricked\n\ndoctors   into    ordering     medically     unnecessary    tests,      for   which\n\nMedicare paid.       Damon added little-used tests to more popular\n\npanels of tests; it then tricked doctors by concealing that the\n\npanels could be ordered without the added tests and that Medicare\n\nwas   being    charged   for    the   tests.       To   conceal    from   doctors\n\nthat Medicare was being charged, and to encourage doctors to order\n\nferritin tests regardless of medical necessity, the defendants\n\ncharged doctors and patients little or no extra fee for the added\n\ntests; provided literature saying that ferritin was provided free;\n\notherwise failed to disclose to doctors the cost to Medicare of the\n\nexpanded LabScan; and made it difficult to order the bundled test\n\nwithout ferritin.\n\n              The defense theories were that there was no conspiracy\n\nand, if there were, then Thurston was not a knowing participant.\n\nThe defense contended that Damon complied with existing Medicare\n\nregulations,     which   neither      prohibited    bundling      nor   imposed   a\n\nrequirement on the lab to disregard a physician's certification\n\nthat tests were medically necessary.            It further argued that even\n\nif Thurston's interpretation of the regulations was incorrect, it\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fwas objectively reasonable, and so Thurston lacked the required\n\ncriminal intent.    Thurston's defense was also that any fraud was\n\ncarried out   by   his    subordinates,    without   his   knowledge.   He\n\ntestified that he did not instruct the labs to add ferritin; did\n\nnot authorize or condone any decision to forego a fee increase for\n\ndoctors or private-pay patients on the expanded LabScan; did not\n\ninstruct subordinates to conceal that doctors could order a LabScan\n\nwithout ferritin; and had nothing to do with requisition forms or\n\nparticular pieces of marketing literature.\n\nC.   Evidence of Conspiracy to Defraud\n\n1.   Addition of Ferritin\n\n           In late 1987, HCFA announced that effective April 1,\n\n1988, Medicare would reduce by almost sixteen percent the fees paid\n\nto laboratories, including Damon, for providing clinical laboratory\n\nservices to beneficiaries.        If Damon maintained its existing\n\npractices and fee structure, then Damon would lose $800,000 in\n\nrevenues during the first year alone, as Thurston knew.            Of that\n\namount, more than $500,000 of the annual losses would occur at\n\nThurston's four regional laboratories.\n\n           There   were     corporate     discussions,     which   included\n\nThurston, about how to offset this loss.        As a result, Damon added\n\nits ferritin test to the LabScan, a panel of more than a dozen\n\nblood chemistry tests performed by a single machine on one blood\n\nsample.   The ferritin test was performed on separate equipment.\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fDamon bundled ferritin with the LabScan from 1988 to at least mid-\n\n1993.    The LabScan had been requested on at least thirty-five to\n\nforty percent of the orders submitted to Thurston's regional\n\nlaboratories.     By contrast, doctors rarely ordered the ferritin\n\ntest.    The general manager of one of the laboratories Thurston\n\noversaw estimated that only one to two percent of the orders for\n\nblood tests included a request for a ferritin test.\n\n           Nothing in the medical literature at the time showed\n\nferritin was necessary for all persons receiving LabScans. Indeed,\n\nit was not.       A family practitioner testified that he needed\n\nferritin less than ten percent of the time it was included as part\n\nof the LabScan.    Similarly, an internist testified that he needed\n\nthe ferritin test for very few of his Medicare patients.\n\n           The plan to add ferritin to the LabScan was discussed at\n\na general managers meeting in January 1988 and at a mid-year\n\nfinancial meeting for the western region in March 1988.        Thurston\n\nattended   both   meetings.   In   late   March,   Thurston   personally\n\napproved the addition of ferritin to the LabScans offered by the\n\nNewbury Park, San Francisco, and Phoenix labs.3 Thurston initially\n\nacquiesced when the Phoenix lab sought permission not to add\n\n\n     3\n       There was abundant evidence that Thurston instructed his\nsubordinates to add ferritin. For example, the general manager of\nthe Chicago lab had contemporaneous notes of a conversation with\nThurston in 1988 indicating that Thurston told him to add ferritin\nto the LabScan.     The manager of the San Francisco lab also\ntestified that Thurston called him and told him to add the ferritin\ntest to the LabScan.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fferritin; in August 1988, however, after Thurston saw the financial\n\nresults from the addition of ferritin at his other labs, Thurston\n\nordered the Phoenix lab to add the test to the LabScan.\n\n            Thurston presented evidence that the decision to add\n\nferritin    was   made   at   a   lower   level   for   legitimate    reasons.\n\nThurston and Isola testified that at the general managers meeting\n\nin early 1988, management decided to allow individual laboratories\n\nto determine whether to add ferritin to the LabScan.                 There was\n\nalso testimony that Damon's sales force made requests to the sales\n\nmanagers and general managers of individual labs to add ferritin to\n\nthe LabScan, on the grounds that the new test would make the panel\n\nmore competitive.\n\n2.   Differential Charging for Ferritin Test\n\na.   Thurston's Knowledge of Price Differential\n\n            Medicare provided one reimbursement for the ferritin test\n\nand a separate reimbursement for the LabScan panel.            In 1988, for\n\nexample, Medicare paid $24.05 for a LabScan and $20.86 for a\n\nferritin test.\n\n            Thurston's labs submitted to him capital expenditure\n\nrequests (CERs) to help with the decision whether to bundle the\n\ntests.     CERs were financial projections comparing the additional\n\nrevenues (from Medicare reimbursements) and costs (partly from the\n\npurchase of new equipment) that would result from the addition of\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fferritin to the LabScan.4       These CERs assumed there would be no\n\nincrease in the charge to doctors and patients for a LabScan with\n\nferritin.    Thurston discussed and then signed the CERs.               They\n\nprojected losses of revenue from doctors and patients (who would\n\nreceive free ferritin tests) and massive increases in revenue from\n\nMedicare reimbursements.      One lab, for example, projected that the\n\nnumber of ferritin tests performed for Medicare beneficiaries would\n\ngrow from 25 per month to 1,946 per month -- increasing revenues by\n\n$10,308 per month.     Overall, Thurston's labs projected that they\n\nwould increase their Medicare reimbursements by approximately $1.16\n\nmillion per year by adding ferritin to the LabScan; if multiplied\n\nby five years, this increase would be $5.8 million.            The capital\n\nexpenditure requests were best-case projections, assuming that\n\nevery doctor who would otherwise have ordered a LabScan without\n\nferritin would now order a LabScan with ferritin.\n\n            Damon   sought   reimbursement   (at   different   rates)    for\n\nferritin tests from Medicare, CHAMPUS,5 and other insurers, but\n\nprovided them for free to doctors and patients.         Thurston said he\n\nwas unaware doctors were not being charged.        But Thurston approved\n\n\n\n     4\n       The defense argues that the CERs were prepared for the\nrelated purpose of justifying, to Damon executives, the purchase of\nequipment to carry out a higher volume of ferritin tests.\n     5\n       CHAMPUS is the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the\nUniformed Services, a health benefit and insurance program for\ndependants of military personnel that is administered by the\nDepartment of Defense.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fthe decision by a number of his labs to adopt this policy of\n\ndifferential pricing depending on the client, and the CERs assumed\n\nno price increase for doctors and patients.              Thurston instructed a\n\nsubordinate to add ferritin at no charge to doctors; Thurston was\n\npresent at a meeting in which another executive announced the no-\n\ncharge policy; and Thurston received a memo saying that there was\n\nno price increase for doctors at a lab he oversaw.                      Witnesses\n\ntestified that physicians are highly price-sensitive about charges\n\nfor lab work and might object to the automatic inclusion of\n\nferritin    unless    the   test    were   provided     for   free.     At   least\n\ninitially, many or all of Thurston's labs increased the charge to\n\nprivate insurance companies for a LabScan based on the addition of\n\nferritin.    However, any price increase for private insurers on the\n\nexpanded    LabScan   was    much   smaller     than    the   cost    increase   to\n\nMedicare.\n\n            Thurston presented evidence that two of his labs did\n\nincrease    the   price     for   physicians;    that    this   price    increase\n\nprovoked complaints by doctors; that he was informed of these\n\ncomplaints; and that he responded that doctors could not obtain a\n\nLabScan with ferritin unless they paid the higher price.                  He also\n\npresented evidence that the no-charge approach was a deviation from\n\ncorporate policy and was initiated by the heads of individual labs;\n\nthat he did not find out about any price differential until years\n\nafter it had been implemented; and that he sought to correct any\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fprice differential as soon as he discovered it. Thurston testified\n\nthat he did not authorize, condone, or ratify a decision not to\n\nincrease    the   price    of    the   LabScan       based   on    the   addition   of\n\nferritin.\n\nb.   Concealing Price Differential from Doctors\n\n            Thurston's labs took steps to conceal from doctors that,\n\nin addition to the LabScan charge, Medicare would pay an extra fee\n\nfor the ferritin tests.          No letters were sent to doctors advising\n\nthem that Medicare would be charged separately for the ferritin\n\ntest.   To the contrary, in April and May 1988, letters were sent to\n\nphysicians notifying them that the ferritin test was going to be\n\nautomatically added at \"no extra cost.\"                In Newbury Park, stickers\n\nwere    also   printed     and    added    to    physicians'         brochures      and\n\ndirectories saying, \"Ferritin Automatically Included at No Charge.\"\n\nOf course, as to Medicare patients, these statements were untrue.\n\n            Thurston      testified    that     he    did    not   pre-approve      the\n\nletters or stickers saying ferritin would be provided free to\n\ncustomers.     Thurston portrayed himself as a hands-off manager who\n\ntrusted subordinates to build in a charge to physicians and to\n\naccurately promote the expanded LabScan.\n\n            Several physicians testified they were initially unaware\n\nthat Damon charged Medicare for the ferritin component of the\n\nexpanded LabScan.      A number of Damon customers protested, and even\n\nswitched labs, when they belatedly discovered Damon was charging\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fMedicare for ferritin tests conducted as part of the LabScan. When\n\ndoctors told Damon sales representatives that they did not need the\n\nadditional test, some were told that a LabScan without ferritin\n\nwould cost more than a LabScan with ferritin.                   A major client\n\nreferred Damon to a newspaper article criticizing the practice of\n\nbundling tests into panels and profiles, and warned Damon that its\n\nfailure     to   educate    doctors    about     the    composition     of     and\n\nalternatives to its panels would subject it to ongoing criticism.\n\nThurston was informed of these complaints, which were written up in\n\nmonthly management reports he received in 1989 and 1990.                Despite\n\nthese complaints, Thurston did not cause a letter to be sent to\n\ndoctors   informing    them   of   the   extra    charge      for   ferritin      to\n\nMedicare.\n\n            Damon    also   collaborated       with    HMOs    operating     on   a\n\ncapitation basis (i.e., paying a flat monthly fee for each HMO\n\nmember) to reduce utilization of bundled tests such as the LabScan.\n\nFor example, one of Thurston's labs added to its HMO requisition\n\nform a checkbox for a LabScan without ferritin.               Damon made no such\n\neffort to assist Medicare.\n\n3.   Availability of LabScan Without Ferritin\n\n            Thurston instructed subordinates to take specific steps\n\nthat hid the fact that the LabScan could be ordered without\n\nferritin and made it difficult for doctors to order the LabScan\n\nseparately.      For example, Thurston told the general manager of the\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fNewbury Park lab not to advertise or promote the fact that doctors\n\ncould still order a LabScan without ferritin.   Similarly, Thurston\n\nhelped make the decision to omit, from the Newbury Park letter\n\nannouncing to doctors the addition of ferritin to the LabScan, the\n\ntest code for ordering a LabScan without ferritin.    The standard\n\nrequisition forms used by Thurston's labs did not change following\n\nthe addition of ferritin to the LabScan; there was a checkbox for\n\nthe \"LabScan\" (which now included ferritin) but no box for the\n\n\"LabScan without ferritin\" or the \"LabScan with ferritin.\"\n\n          During the conspiracy period, there were at least two\n\nways for doctors to order the LabScan without ferritin. They could\n\nhandwrite such an order on a standard requisition form, or they\n\ncould request and obtain a customized requisition form with a\n\ncheckbox for the LabScan without ferritin. A number of doctors and\n\ninstitutions took advantage of these options.\n\n          Thurston testified that he did not tell anyone to conceal\n\nor refrain from advertising that the LabScan could be ordered\n\nwithout ferritin. There was testimony that, after Thurston learned\n\nin 1991 that the front of a requisition form used by one of his\n\nlabs did not disclose the inclusion of ferritin in the LabScan, he\n\ninstructed a subordinate to list it on the front and the form was\n\nso amended.\n\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f4.   Apolipoprotein\n\n           Damon also added an apolipoprotein test to its coronary\n\nrisk panel in 1989.     Before apolipoprotein was added to the panel,\n\nclients ordered it very rarely.         The standard requisition forms\n\nDamon used after adding apolipoprotein to the panel also did not\n\noffer a checkbox for a coronary risk panel without apolipoprotein.\n\nFollowing the addition of apolipoprotein, the cost to doctors of\n\nthe coronary risk panel increased by five dollars.                  Medicare\n\nreimbursed apolipoprotein separately at a rate well above five\n\ndollars.     Thurston    participated     in   the    decisions    about   the\n\naddition, the requisition forms for, and the extra charges for\n\napolipoprotein.\n\nD.   Thurston's \"Reasonable Interpretation\" as Evidence of Lack of\n     Criminal Intent\n\n           Thurston presented evidence that from 1988 to 1993 it was\n\nan industry-wide practice for labs to rely on the doctors who\n\nordered    tests   to   make   determinations    of    medical    necessity.\n\nBecause, prior to 1994, doctors did not normally share their\n\ndiagnoses with labs, labs did not have the information required to\n\ngauge medical necessity. Damon employees did not believe that they\n\ncertified tests as medically necessary when they submitted HCFA\n\n1500 forms with Medicare bills.      Instead, they believed it was the\n\ndoctors who ordered LabScans who made the certification.\n\n            Two expert witnesses testified that it was appropriate in\n\n1988 to include ferritin in a blood chemistry panel.             The bundling\n\n                                   -16-\n\fof   different     tests       into   panels      was   lawful   under   Medicare\n\nregulations. There was testimony that technological changes during\n\nthe 1980s made it possible to automate the ferritin test, which\n\npresumably made it much cheaper to conduct.                  Witnesses for both\n\nsides testified that by 1988 some of Damon's competitors offered\n\nferritin as part of their blood chemistry panel and so Damon added\n\nthe test to stay competitive.\n\n                           II.    Procedural History\n\nA.   Indictment and Trial\n\n           On January 22, 1998, a thirty-nine paragraph single-count\n\nindictment charged Thurston and three other former Damon executives\n\n-- Joseph Isola, Beno Kon, and Gerald Cullen -- with conspiring to\n\ndefraud HCFA in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3716 by causing doctors to\n\norder unnecessary tests by adding a test for ferritin to a pre-\n\nexisting panel of diagnostic blood tests, and by adding a test for\n\napolipoproteins     to     a   profile     used    to   assess   coronary   artery\n\ndisease.   The conspiracy period was from July 1987 to August 1993.\n\n           Isola, President of Damon, pled no contest and, pursuant\n\nto his plea agreement, was sentenced to three years' probation and\n\na    one-hundred    dollar       special     assessment.         Kon,    Corporate\n\nController, died during the proceedings.                   Cullen, Senior Vice\n\nPresident for Operations, was tried before the district court in\n\n\n\n      6\n       Damon was separately indicted for conspiracy to defraud\nHCFA, on the basis of the same events.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fOctober   2001    and    acquitted   at   the   close    of    the    government's\n\nevidence.    In addition, Damon pled guilty on October 11, 1996 to\n\nconspiracy to defraud by bundling ferritin with the LabScan and\n\napolipoprotein with the cardiac risk panel.                    The company was\n\nsentenced to pay a $35,273,141 fine, and later entered into a civil\n\nsettlement under which it paid the United States and the state\n\nMedicaid programs an additional $83,756,904.\n\n            Thurston was tried before a jury in November and December\n\n2001.     The    trial   lasted   three    weeks.       At    the    close    of   the\n\ngovernment's evidence, the district court granted Thurston's motion\n\nfor judgment of acquittal as to the indictment's apolipoprotein\n\nallegations, ordered these allegations stricken, and explained to\n\nthe jury that only the ferritin allegations remained.                        The jury\n\nfound Thurston guilty.       Thurston's subsequent motions for judgment\n\nof acquittal and for new trial were denied. The procedural rulings\n\nat trial which Thurston attacks are described below.\n\nB.   Sentencing\n\n            The district court sentenced Thurston to three months'\n\nimprisonment (with a judicial recommendation that the term be\n\nserved in a halfway house), followed by twenty-four months of\n\nsupervised release (of which the first three months were to be\n\nserved in home detention).        The court imposed a one-hundred dollar\n\nspecial assessment and no fine.           The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) had\n\nrecommended a Total Offense Level of twenty-six and a Criminal\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fHistory Category of one. The PSR identified the base offense level\n\nas six.   It recommended a fourteen-level upward enhancement for an\n\nintended loss     of   at   least   five    million    dollars;    a    two-level\n\nenhancement for more than minimal planning; and a four-level\n\nenhancement for a leadership role.             It also suggested that an\n\nenhancement for obstruction of justice was appropriate, on the\n\ngrounds that Thurston perjured himself at his trial.                     The PSR\n\nrecommended      the   statutory    maximum        term   of    sixty     months'\n\nimprisonment and noted that both the statute and the guideline\n\nallowed for a fine.     It calculated that Thurston had a net worth of\n\n$1,526,904.\n\n           The    defense     contested      the    PSR's      recommendations.\n\nThurston requested a three-level decrease because the substantive\n\noffense of defrauding the United States was incomplete; a four-\n\nlevel decrease because Thurston was a minimal participant; and a\n\ntwo-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility.                    Thurston\n\nrequested a downward departure on the grounds that he had an\n\nextraordinary record of charitable work and community service; that\n\nthe offense constituted aberrant behavior; and that there was the\n\npotential for a large disparity with Isola's sentence.\n\n           The government argued that Thurston should receive a two-\n\nlevel upward enhancement for obstruction of justice. Otherwise, it\n\naccepted the recommendations of the PSR.              The parties agreed that\n\nany restitution had been made by Damon, the corporate defendant.\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f            The district court sentenced Thurston at a hearing on\n\nJune 26, 2002 to three months' imprisonment, a period of supervised\n\nrelease, and no fine.        The district court granted a fourteen-level\n\nenhancement   for      the   size   of    the    intended    loss,   see U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2F1.1(b)(0) (1992 version),7 a four-level enhancement for an\n\naggravated role in the offense, see U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a) (1992\n\nversion),    and   a   two-level       enhancement     for   more    than   minimal\n\nplanning, see U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1(b)(2) (1992 version). The court did\n\nnot explicitly rule on the government's request for an obstruction\n\nof justice enhancement, see U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 (1992 version), or\n\nThurston's request for a three-level decrease for failure to show\n\ncompletion of the substantive offense, see § 2X1.1 (1992 version).\n\nThurston's    adjusted       offense     level   of   twenty-six     and    criminal\n\nhistory category of one yielded a guidelines sentencing range of\n\nsixty-three to seventy-eight months' imprisonment; this range was\n\ntrumped by the statutory maximum of sixty months for a violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 371.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1 was deleted by consolidation with U.S.S.G.\n§ 2B1.1 effective November 1, 2001. See United States v. Gonzalez-\nAlvarez, 277 F.3d 73, 77 n.3 (1st Cir. 2002). Under the current\nGuidelines, a loss exceeding $2.5 million warrants an eighteen-\nlevel upward enhancement.     U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1).     When the\nGuidelines in effect at the time of sentencing are more stringent\nthan those in effect at the time of the offense, the latter are\nnormally used, partly to avoid any hint of an ex post facto\nincrease in penalty. United States v. Maldonado, 242 F.3d 1, 5\n(1st Cir. 2001) (citing United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040,\n1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n                                         -20-\n\f            During    the    hearing,   the   government   confirmed      that\n\nThurston had been offered (and had rejected) a plea agreement\n\n\"along the lines\" of the one that Isola had accepted.                 Over the\n\ngovernment's objections and arguments, the district court then\n\ndeparted downward on the basis of Thurston's record of charitable\n\nwork and community service and the disparity between Thurston's and\n\nIsola's sentences.          The court then solicited the government's\n\nrecommendation about the extent of the departure.              The government\n\nresponded that, if the court chose to depart, then it should depart\n\nno further than the sentencing guidelines for a perjury conviction,\n\nwhich would be an offense level of twenty (six less than that of\n\nthe underlying offense), for a sentencing range of thirty-three to\n\nforty-one months' imprisonment.          The court then departed by at\n\nleast sixteen levels.\n\n            The     government   appealed     the   sentence    and   Thurston\n\nappealed his conviction and sentence.\n\n             III.     Thurston's Appeal from his Conviction\n\n            Thurston was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 371, which\n\nprovides:\n\n            If two or more persons conspire either to commit any\n            offense against the United States, or to defraud the\n            United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for\n            any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act\n            to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be\n            fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five\n            years, or both.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fA.   Statute of limitations\n\n           Thurston    argues    that   the    trial   court    erred   in    not\n\ngranting his post-verdict Rule 29 motion for acquittal, because the\n\ngovernment had not proved an overt act during the limitations\n\nperiod, and in not sua sponte instructing the jury on the statute\n\nof limitations.\n\n           The statute of limitations for 18 U.S.C. § 371 crimes is\n\nthe general five-year statute of limitations contained in 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3282.   Here, that five years ran back from January 22, 1998, the\n\ndate of the indictment, less the six weeks during which Thurston\n\nagreed to toll the limitation period.           The government, therefore,\n\nhad to prove an overt act was done on or after December 11, 1992.\n\nThe indictment properly alleged at least eight overt acts within\n\nthe limitations period.\n\n           Thurston    did   not    raise     the   defense    of   statute    of\n\nlimitations   either    before     or   at    trial,   did    not   request    an\n\ninstruction on the defense, and did not object when the judge\n\ninstructed without addressing the issue. Thurston first raised the\n\nissue by Rule 29 motion after the verdict.              The government says\n\nThurston raised the issue too late.                 There is a preliminary\n\nquestion of when such a motion should be raised, a question\n\naffecting our standard of review.\n\n           \"The statute of limitations is a defense and must be\n\nasserted on the trial by the defendant in criminal cases . . . .\"\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fBiddinger v. Comm'r of Police, 245 U.S. 128, 135 (1917).   Here the\n\nindictment adequately pled facts to establish that the crime was\n\nwithin the limitations period.    Thurston was not required to raise\n\nthe defense before trial under Rule 12(b)(3), Fed. R. Crim P.   Nor\n\nwould it have made sense for him to do so, since the defense\n\ndepended on what the government proved or failed to prove at trial.\n\nIn a criminal case a defendant need only plead as to the accusation\n\nof guilt in the indictment and need not raise the statute of\n\nlimitations as an affirmative defense before trial.8       Thurston\n\nmistakes these truisms for an argument that he need not raise the\n\nlimitations defense at all before the jury delivers a verdict of\n\nguilt.\n\n            The government says Thurston has waived9 the issue and\n\nmay not raise it at all.   Absent an explicit agreement to waive the\n\ndefense, we treat the issue as a forfeiture and not a waiver,\n\ncontrary to the government's argument. This was not an intentional\n\nrelinquishment or abandonment of a known right, the definition of\n\na waiver.   The issue of failure to assert the defense was viewed as\n\n\n     8\n       By contrast, in a civil case, a defense of statute of\nlimitations must be raised in an answer or it is lost. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 8(c); In re Cumberland Farms, Inc., 284 F.3d 216, 225-27\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n     9\n       A defendant may waive the defense of statute of limitations\nby several means, including by entry of plea of guilty, see\nAcevedo-Ramos v. United States, 961 F.2d 305, 308 (1st Cir. 1992),\nor by a voluntary agreement, usually written, such as in a tolling\nagreement, see United States v. Spector, 55 F.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir.\n1995). None of those situations is present here.\n\n                                 -23-\n\fforfeiture in United States v. O'Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 23 n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).       The rule we use -- that the defense of statute of\n\nlimitations must be raised at trial and, if not, is forfeited but\n\nnot waived -- is the rule in most circuits.                     See United States v.\n\nRoss, 77 F.3d 1525, 1536 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"[I]t is widely accepted\n\nthat a statute of limitations defense is forfeited if not raised at\n\nthe trial itself.\") (citing cases).\n\n               Thurston has indeed forfeited10 the defense that the\n\ngovernment did not prove facts that an overt act occurred within\n\nthe limitations period.              The defense should have been raised at\n\ntrial.     Waiting until after the jury has rendered a verdict of\n\nguilt     to   raise    a   limitations       defense     for   the   first   time    is\n\ninconsistent        with     the     characterization        of    the   statute      of\n\nlimitations as an affirmative defense and would unfairly sandbag\n\nthe government.\n\n               Because this was a forfeiture and not a waiver, there is\n\nstill plain error review available under Rule 52, Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\nUnited     States      v.   Olano,    507    U.S.    725,    731-32   (1993).        Our\n\nconclusion       is     straightforward.            The     government's      evidence\n\nestablished overt acts by the conspirators within the limitations\n\n\n\n     10\n        Our reasoning that the argument has been forfeited would be\ndifferent if compliance with the limitations period were either\njurisdictional or an element of the offense which the government\nhad the burden of proving. Here, when the limitations defense is\nnot an issue of law but is based on facts to be proven, the defense\nmust be raised at trial at the latest.\n\n                                            -24-\n\fperiod,   so   there   was   no    error   at    all    as   to   the   statute   of\n\nlimitations, much less plain error.\n\n           The government showed that labs overseen by Thurston (and\n\nhis co-conspirators) submitted tens of thousands of reimbursement\n\nclaims to Medicare after December 11, 1992 for ferritin tests\n\nconducted as part of LabScan orders. The government also presented\n\nample evidence that many of these tests were medically unnecessary\n\nand were submitted by doctors unaware that Medicare would be\n\ncharged separately for ferritin.11              It was not credible that the\n\nferritin test, ordered less than two percent of the time, suddenly\n\nbecame medically necessary thirty to forty percent of the time\n\nwithin the life span of the conspiracy.\n\n           Thurston     also      argues   he     was    entitled       to   a   jury\n\ninstruction on the limitations point. By failing to request a jury\n\ninstruction and failing to object to the lack of an instruction, he\n\nhas forfeited the argument.        Fed. R. Crim. P. 30; see United States\n\nv. Gallant, 306 F.3d 1181, 1187 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"[A] party unhappy\n\nwith a trial court's jury instruction [must] promptly state the\n\nprecise objection after the instruction has been given.\").                        As\n\n\n\n\n     11\n       For example, government witness Dr. Johnson testified that\nhe ordered the LabScan regularly for Medicare patients; rarely\nneeded a ferritin test; and, when he discovered that Damon charged\nMedicare separately for ferritin, demanded that ferritin be removed\nfrom panels he ordered.     As demonstrated by a lab report the\ndefense introduced into evidence, Dr. Johnson continued ordering\nthe LabScan with ferritin for Medicare patients through mid-1993.\n\n                                      -25-\n\fthere was no error, the plain error standard was not met.      See Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 30, 52(b).\n\nB.   Purported Lack of Criminal Intent and the Requested Reasonable\n     Interpretation Regulation\n\n           Procedurally, the issue of reasonable interpretation\n\ncomes up in two ways: denial of Thurston's Rule 29 motions and\n\ndenial of his request for a jury instruction.          Thurston's three\n\nRule 29 motions -- at the end of the government's case, at the end\n\nof the defense case, and after the verdict -- all argued that he\n\nlacked the needed criminal intent.       Our review is of whether a\n\nrational fact finder could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\nthat the government proved the elements of the crime, including\n\nintent. United States v. Moran, 312 F.3d 480, 487 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nThurston   also   requested   a   jury   instruction    on   reasonable\n\n\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\finterpretation of the law12 and preserved his objection to the\n\ncourt's rejection of the instruction.\n\n             Thurston argued he reasonably interpreted the law as\n\nrequiring that the treating physician, not the test lab, certify to\n\nthe   HCFA    that   the   test   ordered   was   medically   necessary   and\n\nreasonable, and that he and the company were entitled to rely on\n\nthat physician certification.          Specifically, Thurston contended\n\nthat in the relevant time period an independent clinical lab did\n\nnot violate any aspect of Medicare law by: (1) providing physicians\n\nwith a panel containing a ferritin test, so long as the physician\n\nwas given reliable and accurate information about the test and\n\n\n      12\n           The instruction he requested stated in part:\n\n           Mr. Thurston contends that an independent clinical\n      laboratory does not violate any aspect of Medicare law in\n      providing physicians with a profile or panel that contains a\n      serum ferritin test, so long as the physician is given\n      reliable and accurate information about the test and the\n      choice to select the profile or panel with or without the\n      added test.\n\n           Mr. Thurston also contends that an independent clinical\n      laboratory does not violate any aspect of Medicare law in\n      submitting a claim for reimbursement, using a HCFA form or\n      otherwise, so long as the blood tests performed were ordered\n      by a physician.\n\n           I instruct you as a matter of              law that    these are\n      reasonable   interpretations of the              Medicare    statutes,\n      regulations and rules.\n\n           In order for you to find Mr. Thurston guilty on the basis\n      that he caused physicians to order medically unnecessary tests\n      for their patients, the government must prove beyond a\n      reasonable doubt that these were not Mr. Thurston's\n      interpretations of the pertinent Medicare laws.\n\n                                     -27-\n\fcould select the panel without the test; or (2) submitting a\n\nreimbursement claim, using a HCFA form or otherwise, so long as a\n\nphysician ordered the test performed.          This is one of his primary\n\narguments on appeal.\n\n          Whether a particular defense doctrine is germane depends\n\non the crime charged and the facts of the case.            This is where\n\nThurston's argument falters.       He argues that he could not have had\n\nthe needed intent because employees of clinical labs, including\n\nThurston, \"were unaware that they were actually certifying the\n\nmedical necessity of each test performed for every patient\" and\n\nthey could reasonably interpret the law to mean that the treating\n\nphysician,   not   the    laboratory,   made   the   certification.   The\n\nargument is beside the point.13\n\n          Thurston was not charged with making a false statement to\n\nthe United States, the falsity of which turned on an ambiguity in\n\nwhat the law required.       Nor was he charged with failing to make a\n\nstatement required by law in a situation of parallel ambiguity. He\n\nwas not charged with falsely certifying the medical necessity of\n\nthe tests ordered.       He was charged with the crime of conspiracy to\n\ndefraud the United States by inducing physicians through deceit and\n\ntrickery into certifying tests as medically necessary when the\n\n\n\n     13\n        Thurston argues it would be nonsensical to ask clinical\ntesting laboratories to guarantee that a test ordered by a doctor\nwas in fact medically necessary.    That question simply is not\nraised here.\n\n                                   -28-\n\fferritin tests were not necessary, thus leading Medicare to pay for\n\nunnecessary services.\n\n            Thurston's knowledge of the Medicare regulations and of\n\nthe fact that the ordering physicians would certify the medical\n\nnecessity of the tests was, ironically, part of the proof of the\n\ncrime, not a defense.          Thurston cannot, under 18 U.S.C. § 371,\n\nknowingly     conspire    to    mislead     and   manipulate       doctors   into\n\ncertifying    medically    unnecessary      tests    which   led    to   improper\n\npayment of Medicare funds and then defend on the basis that he\n\ncommitted no fraud because the doctors, not he, were the ones who\n\ncertified the tests as necessary.\n\n             Thurston's reliance on United States v. Prigmore, 243\n\nF.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2001), is misplaced.             Prigmore is part of a line\n\nof cases charging false statements or failure to make required\n\nstatements, holding that intent should be measured against an\n\nobjectively reasonable understanding of the legal requirements to\n\nbe met, and that a statement is not in fact false or fraudulent if\n\nit is based on an objectively reasonable interpretation of that\n\nlegal requirement.       See id. at 17-18.          This court first applied\n\nthis principle in United States v. Rowe, 144 F.3d 15, 21-23 (1st\n\nCir. 1998), to a statement that was not in fact false under an\n\nobjectively reasonable interpretation of a disclosure requirement.\n\nIn Prigmore, the conspiracy charged was to defraud and impair the\n\nfunctioning of the Food and Drug Administration, in connection with\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fits oversight and regulation of medical devices, through failure to\n\nfile reports which were required under certain conditions.            The\n\nfraud alleged was the failure to submit a pre-market approval\n\ninformation supplement to the FDA, but whether such a supplement\n\nwas required depended on the interpretation of certain regulations.\n\nThe same conditional requirement was true of certain testing\n\nreports. The question was whether defendants could objectively and\n\nreasonably understand one regulatory phrase, \"affecting the safety\n\nor effectiveness of the device,\" as being circumscribed by another\n\nregulatory phrase, \"intended . . . conditions of use.\"            See 243\n\nF.3d at 15.\n\n            No similar question was presented here.             Here, the\n\nunderlying crime was one of manipulating doctors into making false\n\ncertifications    so   Damon   could    receive   unwarranted    Medicare\n\npayments.     There is no material question about ambiguity in the\n\nunderlying legal requirements and no germane question about the\n\nmeaning of the law.    There was also no issue of lack of fair notice\n\nof what the law requires, a concern underlying the Prigmore/Rowe\n\nline of cases.     A reasonable person knows it is wrong to trick\n\nothers into doing something wrong which one does not do directly\n\noneself, especially in order to obtain personal gain. The Prigmore\n\ndoctrine has no application given the crimes charged and the facts\n\ninvolved.     Because the nature of the crime charged made the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\freasonable interpretation doctrine irrelevant, the jury instruction\n\nissue disappears.\n\nC.   Failure of District Court to Respond To All of Thurston's\n     Requested Instructions\n\n           Thurston argues that the district court violated Rule 30,\n\nFed. R. Crim. P., which provides that\n\n           (a)      In General.   Any party may request in writing\n                    that the court instruct the jury on the law as\n                    specified in the request.   The request must be\n                    made at the close of the evidence or at any\n                    earlier time that the court reasonably sets.\n                    When the request is made, the requesting party\n                    must furnish a copy to every other party.\n\n           (b)      Ruling on a Request. The court must inform the\n                    parties before closing arguments how it intends\n                    to rule on the requested instructions.\n\nThurston is correct: the district court failed to inform the\n\nparties of how it intended to rule on each of the requested\n\ninstructions before closing arguments, as required by the rule.\n\n           A description of the interactions of court and counsel\n\nsets the   stage.     Each   side   submitted   extensive   requests   for\n\ninstructions, and there were disagreements.14 The court did resolve\n\n\n     14\n       As examples of disagreements, Thurston gives the following.\nThe   government   filed   objections   to   Thurston's   requested\ninstructions concerning character evidence and reputation (No. 7);\nThurston's status as vice-president (No. 10); the definition of\n\"knowingly\" (No. 16); the definition of \"willfully\" (No. 17); proof\nof specific intent to participate (No. 18); the definition of\n\"overt act\" (No. 21); the good-faith defense (No. 22); and\nThurston's reasonable interpretation of Medicare laws (No. 23).\nCounsel for Thurston objected to three of the government's\nrequested instructions, each of which concerned an element of the\noffense: conspiracy (No. 18); unlawful objectives (No. 19); and\novert acts (No. 22).\n\n                                    -31-\n\fthe most serious disputes over some of the instructions (for\n\ninstance, on the reasonable interpretation/Prigmore question) and\n\ntold counsel these rulings before closing argument.                 The court did\n\nnot, though, review all of the requests.            Thurston's counsel did\n\nnot object to this silence before giving his closing.\n\n             Defense counsel did raise an issue after closing, and\n\nbefore the jury was instructed, that he wanted to put on record his\n\nspecific objections to the government's requests.               He did not say\n\nhe had been prejudiced in any way by the court's failure to rule on\n\nthe requested instructions before he gave his closing.                  The court\n\nreplied that it would neither rule on nor hear argument on the\n\nproposed instructions.     Rather, the court stated its understanding\n\nthat   the   appropriate   time   to   object     was   at    the    end   of   the\n\ninstructions.       Nonetheless,       it   did   hear       argument      on   the\n\ngovernment's Request No. 8 (the compelled witness rule), and\n\ndeclined to give the instruction.           It also heard argument on the\n\ngovernment's proposed instructions No. 18 (conspiracy); No. 19\n\n(unlawful objectives); and No. 22 (overt act).               The only proposed\n\ndefense instruction called to the court's attention was No. 24, on\n\nmissing witnesses.\n\n             The district court did not, as Rule 30 requires, tell\n\ncounsel before closing argument its disposition of all of the\n\nrequested instructions. But counsel for Thurston had an obligation\n\n\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\fto bring this to the court's attention before the closing and did\n\nnot do so.\n\n              Without addressing the issue of whether Thurston has thus\n\nforfeited the Rule 30 argument, we choose to simply evaluate\n\nwhether defense counsel's closing argument was adversely affected.\n\nSee United States v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 753 (1st Cir. 1999).                 It\n\nwas not.      One telling indicium that there was no prejudice is that\n\ntrial counsel did not ever say to the court he would be prejudiced\n\nif he had to proceed with his closing without knowing the court's\n\ndisposition of the remaining requested instructions.\n\n              An even more telling indicium of lack of prejudice is\n\nthat Thurston's appellate counsel has been unable to identify any\n\nspecific areas of prejudice occasioned by the trial court's lapse.\n\nWhile in theory such a lapse could cause prejudice, the most that\n\nis   argued    here   is    that   there   was   \"no    detailed   reference   to\n\nimportant legal concepts regarding criminal conspiracy and the\n\nstate of mind by which Thurston would be judged.\"                        Appellate\n\ncounsel does not identify those \"important legal concepts,\" and we\n\nsee none.       As to Thurston's state of mind, the trial judge did\n\ninstruct on the government's burden to show Thurston had a specific\n\nintent to participate in the conspiracy and to defraud the United\n\nStates.       The   court   instructed     the   jury    to   consider    Thurston\n\nindividually to determine if he willfully joined the conspiracy.\n\nThe court, in turn, defined \"willfully.\" The court also explicitly\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\frejected Thurston's reasonable interpretation instruction, and it\n\ninstructed on good faith.       These circumstances belie any claim of\n\nprejudice and Thurston's claim fails.\n\nD.   Motion for New Trial Based on Dismissal of Apolipoprotein\n     Charge\n\n           Thurston and his co-defendants were originally charged\n\nwith conspiracy to commit fraud as to both the ferritin and the\n\napolipoprotein tests.        At the close of the government's case the\n\ncourt granted Thurston's motion for judgment of acquittal on the\n\napolipoprotein test, struck those references from the indictment,\n\nand instructed the jury that this issue was no longer before it.\n\nThe government did not thereafter refer to this issue.\n\n           Thurston now argues that the court should have granted\n\nThurston   a   new   trial    after    the   jury   returned   because   the\n\napolipoprotein evidence irretrievably tainted the trial.                 The\n\ngovernment rejoins that counsel should have raised the issue\n\nsooner.\n\n           Again, we bypass the issue of forfeiture and reject the\n\nargument that dismissal of the apolipoprotein charges tainted the\n\nproceedings.   Thurston's argument that none of this evidence would\n\nhave been admitted if the ferritin charges were tried alone is\n\nbased on an unlikely premise.         Where the evidence admitted as to a\n\ndismissed count would have been admissible as to a remaining count,\n\nthe defendant has not suffered prejudice. United States v. Rooney,\n\n37 F.3d 847, 855-56 (2d Cir. 1994) (collecting cases); see United\n\n                                      -34-\n\fStates v. Weiner, 3 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1993) (jury properly\n\nconsidered evidence relating to counts dismissed prior to verdict,\n\nsince evidence was relevant to remaining counts).\n\n            The government would have introduced such evidence in any\n\nevent as relevant to rebut central defense themes that, because\n\nDamon had such a decentralized decision-making structure, Thurston\n\nwas not involved in key decisions.            The apolipoprotein evidence\n\ncontradicted Thurston's claims about the extent and consequences of\n\nDamon's    decentralized     approach   to    the   make-up,   pricing,    and\n\nmarketing of its panels.\n\n            There was little risk of prejudice for other reasons.\n\nThe government did not mention the apolipoprotein evidence in its\n\nclosing,    and   exhibits    pertaining     only   to   apolipoprotein   were\n\nremoved before the documents were submitted to the jury.            Further,\n\nmost of the testimony and documentary evidence in the first half of\n\nthe case, before the court ruled on the Rule 29 motion, dealt with\n\nferritin.    These factors further minimized the likelihood of any\n\ntaint.\n\n            Thurston's conviction is affirmed.\n\n                        IV.    Sentencing Appeals\n\nA.   Thurston's Appeal from Loss Calculation\n\n            Much of Thurston's guidelines sentence range (sixty-three\n\nto seventy-eight months) was driven by the loss calculation.              Both\n\nthe PSR and the government recommended an intended loss figure of\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\fmore than five million dollars but less than ten million dollars.\n\nThis resulted in a fourteen-level increase in the base offense\n\nlevel.\n\n               Thurston,   not      surprisingly,      targets       this   loss\n\ncalculation.        He makes two arguments.           The first is that the\n\ngovernment was precluded by a comment to U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1 from ever\n\nrelying on intended loss unless the government first established\n\nwhat the actual loss was and then established that the intended\n\nloss     was    greater.     This     is   a   pure    issue    of    guidelines\n\ninterpretation, which we review de novo.               See United States v.\n\nGonzalez-Alvarez, 277 F.3d 73, 77 (1st Cir. 2002).                   The second\n\nargument is that the court's conclusion had insufficient factual\n\nsupport for a number of reasons, a contention reviewed for clear\n\nerror.\n\n               The guidelines interpretation argument turns on a comment\n\nwhich provides:\n\n               Consistent with the provisions of § 2X1.1 (Attempt,\n               Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the\n               defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined,\n               this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual\n               loss.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2F1.1, cmt. n.7 (Fraud and Deceit).\n\n               Thurston argues that because the government did not show\n\nactual loss, it cannot turn to intended loss.                  The argument is\n\nsimply wrong as a matter of the wording of the comment.                      The\n\ncomment directs the use of an intended loss figure when it is\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\fgreater than the actual loss figure; the comment does not restrict\n\nthe sentencing court's ability to rely on intended loss when there\n\nis no actual loss calculation available.        Defendant's reading also\n\nmakes little sense: it may be easier as a matter of proof to show\n\nintended loss than actual loss.       Conspirators are held accountable\n\nfor the loss they intend to commit.         Finally, it is obvious on\n\nthese facts that the intended loss was greater than the actual loss\n\n-- some doctors quit using Damon when, to their disgust, they\n\nrealized what the scheme was.\n\n          Thurston next mounts a series of fact-based attacks on\n\nthe intended loss figure of more than five million dollars.          That\n\nfigure is supported by the capital expenditure requests each of the\n\nlabs prepared to obtain funding to buy the equipment needed to\n\nperform the increased ferritin testing the labs anticipated.         Each\n\nCER included a financial analysis, one component of which was the\n\nestimated new revenue from bundling the tests.          Thus, the intended\n\nloss calculation was based on the conspirators' own financial\n\ncalculations.\n\n          Thurston   argues     the     CERs,   being     mere   financial\n\nprojections, are not an adequate basis for an intended loss figure;\n\nthat the CERs were based on an assumed best case scenario in which\n\nno physician who ordered Labscans would decline to get ferritin\n\ntests; that, in any event, not all physicians who ordered the\n\nbundled test were tricked into doing so; that the conspiracy was\n\n\n                                 -37-\n\fnot proven to last five years; that the conspiracy ended before\n\nfive years had elapsed for several labs, given the different dates\n\non which the labs bundled the tests; and that later, only one lab\n\nreported to Thurston.\n\n          A number of these are quickly dispatched.              The jury\n\nverdict of guilt disposes of the question of the length of the\n\nconspiracy. Thurston's promotion out of management of three of the\n\nlabs is irrelevant since he earlier conspired to produce losses\n\nintended to go on for years.\n\n          Thurston also argues the intended loss had to be reduced\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 2X1.1(b)(2) because the government's proof did not\n\nestablish that the conspirators had \"completed all the acts the\n\nconspirators believed necessary on their part for the successful\n\ncompletion of the substantive offense.\"     Id.   There is no merit to\n\nthe argument. There was successful completion of the offense: the\n\ntests   were   bundled   and   doctors   were   misled    into   ordering\n\nunnecessary ferritin tests.     The complaints from customers about\n\nDamon's practices were confirmation the scheme had worked.\n\n          The closer question is the degree of precision the\n\ngovernment must reach in showing intended loss.          It is true that\n\nthe CERs set forth best case scenarios which assumed all doctors\n\nwould order the bundled test without culling out the ferritin test.\n\nIf the CERs stood alone, defendant would have a better argument.\n\nBut they are supplemented by the fact that Damon made it extremely\n\n\n                                 -38-\n\fdifficult for doctors to cull out the ferritin and order the\n\nLabscan without a ferritin test.\n\n            Further, the conspirators tried to hide from doctors the\n\nfact that there was a significant cost to Medicare associated with\n\nthe bundling.    The conspirators were maximizing the probability\n\nthat all doctors would accept the bundling, without culling and\n\nwithout protest.   The fact that the conspirators were not entirely\n\nsuccessful in fooling all doctors does not lessen their intent.\n\n            We have noted before that intended loss does not have to\n\nbe determined with precision; the court needs only to make a\n\nreasonable estimate in light of the available information.   United\n\nStates v. Blastos, 258 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 2001).   There was good\n\nevidence of intent and some \"prospect of success\" for the fraud to\n\nreap over five million dollars, and that is all that the case law\n\nrequires.   United States v. Orlando-Figueroa, 229 F.3d 33, 48 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).    The best case CER projection was a loss to Medicare\n\nover the charged five-year life of the conspiracy of $5,800,230.\n\nIt was reasonable for the district court to estimate that the\n\nintended loss exceeded five million dollars, even allowing for the\n\none to two percent normal order rate for ferritin tests.        The\n\ngovernment met its burden and Thurston offered little in rebuttal\n\nexcept his protestations of innocence.    There was no clear error.\n\n\n\n\n                                -39-\n\fB.   Government's Sentencing Appeal\n\n             Given   an   intended   loss   of   five   million   dollars,\n\nThurston's crime led to the statutory maximum sentence of five\n\nyears.      The district court departed downward from the Guidelines\n\nrange by sixteen levels, however, sentencing Thurston to three\n\nmonths' imprisonment to be followed by twenty-four months of\n\nsupervised release. The court imposed no fine and recommended that\n\nthe term of imprisonment be served in a halfway house.\n\n1.   Appeal from Grant of Downward Departures\n\n             The government argues that each of the stated grounds for\n\ndownward departure was in error.15          First, it contends that the\n\n\n      15\n           The court stated:\n\n           [I]n granting the motion for downward departure, I'm\n      basing it on two grounds.\n\n           First, the downward departure is justified because of the\n      defendant Thurston's record of charitable work and community\n      service[, which] is unique, extensive and extraordinary. I\n      think the record should reflect that in over fourteen years of\n      sentencing defendants, it's my judgment that no one had a more\n      extraordinary devotion to charitable work, community service,\n      and especially his dedication to his church.\n\n           And the second ground is that which is set out in the\n      United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual under\n      Chapter 1, Part A, Section 3, which is entitled . . . \"The\n      Basic Approach, paren, policy statement, closed paren,\"\n      setting forth the rationale of the guidelines, it's cited here\n      that Congress sought reasonable uniformity in sentencing by\n      narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar\n      criminal offenses committed by similar offenders.\n\n           Congress sought proportionality in sentencing through a\n      system that imposes appropriately different sentences for\n      criminal conduct of differing severity.\n\n                                     -40-\n\fdistrict     court   was   forbidden          to   depart    downward        based    on   a\n\ndisparity between Thurston's sentence and the sentence of the\n\ncompany president, a cooperating co-conspirator who pled guilty.\n\nNext, it argues that departure for good deeds is discouraged and\n\nthat   the   facts     provide      no    basis    to   warrant        a    finding   that\n\nThurston's    good     deeds   are       so   exceptional         as   to   make   such    a\n\ndeparture appropriate.\n\na.   Standard of Review:         Effect of the PROTECT Act\n\n             On April 30, 2003, certain provisions of a new statute\n\naffecting the courts of appeals' review of sentencing provisions\n\nbecame effective.       The PROTECT Act changes the applicable standard\n\nof review on certain issues in appeals from departures from the\n\nsentencing guidelines.\n\n             Section     401   of    the      PROTECT       Act    amends     18     U.S.C.\n\n§ 3742(e), which now reads:\n\n             (e) Consideration. -- Upon review of the record, the\n             court of appeals shall determine whether the sentence --\n\n             . . . .\n\n                       (3) is outside the applicable guideline range, and\n\n\n\n\n            We have a situation here where coconspirator Isola, the\n       president of Damon and the architect, at least the prime\n       architect of this conspiracy, received a sentence of three\n       years' probation, and it is, in my judgment, a violation of\n       the fundamental purpose of the Sentencing Commission\n       Guidelines to impose a sentence which is not at least somewhat\n       similar to that incurred by a coconspirator who was more\n       involved in the conspiracy t[h]an this defendant.\n\n                                          -41-\n\f                      (A) the district court failed to provide the\n                      written statement of reasons required by\n                      section 3553(c);\n\n                      (B) the sentence departs from the applicable\n                      guideline range based on a factor that --\n\n                           (i) does not advance the objectives set\n                           forth in section 3553(a)(2); or\n\n                           (ii) is not authorized under section\n                           3553(b); or\n\n                           (iii) is not justified by the facts of\n                           this case; or\n\n                      (C) the sentence departs to an unreasonable\n                      degree from the applicable guidelines range,\n                      having regard for the factors to be\n                      considered in imposing a sentence, as set\n                      forth in section 3553(a) of this title and\n                      the reasons for the imposition of the\n                      particular sentence, as stated by the\n                      district court pursuant to the provisions of\n                      section 3553(c); . . . .\n\n          . . . .\n\n          The court of appeals shall give due regard to the\n          opportunity of the district court to judge the\n          credibility of the witnesses, and shall accept the\n          findings of fact of the district court unless they are\n          clearly   erroneous   and,   except   with   respect   to\n          determinations under subsection (3)(A) or (3)(B), shall\n          give due deference to the district court's application of\n          the guidelines to the facts.           With respect to\n          determinations under subsection (3)(A) or (3)(B), the\n          court of appeals shall review de novo the district\n          court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n          This changed the prior law. Under Koon v. United States,\n\n518 U.S. 81 (1996), the appellate courts were not to review a\n\ndeparture decision de novo, but were to ask whether the sentencing\n\n\n                               -42-\n\fcourt abused its discretion.16 Id. at 91, 96-100. Where a district\n\ncourt grants a departure, we have, before the PROTECT Act, engaged\n\nin a three-part review: \"(1) we determine whether the stated ground\n\nfor departure is theoretically permissible under the guidelines;\n\n(2) if so, we examine the record to assess whether there is\n\nadequate factual support; and (3) we determine the appropriateness\n\nof the degree of departure.\"       United States v. Bogdan, 302 F.3d 12,\n\n16 (1st Cir. 2002). Whether a stated ground for departure was\n\ntheoretically permissible (part (1)) was a question of law reviewed\n\nde novo.   United States v. Bradstreet, 207 F.3d 76, 81 (1st Cir.\n\n2000); cf. United States v. Diaz, 285 F.3d 92, 98-99 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (\"We review de novo whether the district court utilized a\n\nproper basis for [an upward] departure.\").           Under Koon, we then\n\nreviewed   the   remaining   two     parts   for   abuse   of   discretion.\n\nSee Koon, 518 U.S. 96-100; United States v. Lujan, 324 F.3d 27, 31\n\nn.5 (1st Cir. 2003); United States v. Martin, 221 F.3d 55 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n           The courts of appeals are now charged with de novo review\n\nof the second issue: whether the facts are exceptional (or outside\n\n\n\n     16\n        Before Koon was decided in 1996, the rule in this circuit\nwas that we would review de novo whether, \"taking the reasons for\ndeparture stated by the district court at face value, those reasons\nwill as a matter of law justify abandonment of the guidelines.\"\nUnited States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1447 (1st Cir. 1991). We\npoint this out because Thurston's fraudulent conduct took place\nbefore Koon and when this court used a de novo standard of review,\nas is now mandated by the PROTECT Act.\n\n                                    -43-\n\fthe heartland), thus warranting consideration of a departure.\n\nCongress requires the courts of appeals to consider whether a\n\nsentence that departs from the applicable guideline range is based\n\non a factor that:\n\n            (i)     does not advance the objectives set forth in\n                    section 3553(a)(2); or\n            (ii)    is not authorized under section 3553(b); or\n            (iii)   is not justified by the facts of the case[.]\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3742(e)(3)(B).\n\n            Thurston argues that the PROTECT Act should not be\n\ninterpreted to apply to this case and that, if it did apply, it\n\nwould be retroactive and invalid.          He makes two statutory intent\n\narguments: (1) that the internal structure of the statute means it\n\nshould not be applied to cases already pending on appeal; and (2)\n\nthat the presumption against retroactivity should apply.\n\n            First, Thurston argues that Congress meant application of\n\nthe de novo review provisions in the PROTECT Act to be deferred\n\nuntil appeals arise from sentences entered after the Act became\n\neffective.    This is evident, Thurston says, since the Act imposed\n\na   new   requirement   for   the   district   judge   to   give   a   written\n\nstatement of reasons.     From this, Thurston argues, all provisions\n\nof the Act were meant to apply only to post-Act sentencing.               The\n\nargument is plausible, but we are unpersuaded.              Even before the\n\nPROTECT Act, a trial court was required to give some reasons,\n\nthough not necessarily in writing, for a downward departure.              See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(c) (2000) (pre-PROTECT Act version); United States\n\n                                    -44-\n\fv.   Sclamo,      997   F.2d   970,   973    (1st   Cir.    1993)   (discussing\n\ndiscouraged ground for departure); United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d\n\n1306, 1324 (1st Cir. 1994) (same).                  A requirement that this\n\nstatement    of    reasons     be   written,    rather     than   oral,   has   no\n\nparticular connection to the appellate standard of review.\n\n            Although the Act does not expressly say that its de novo\n\nreview provision applies to pending appeals, it does give an\n\neffective date of April 30, 2003.           The effective date of a statute\n\ndoes not by itself establish that it has any application to conduct\n\nthat occurred at an earlier date.              See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S.\n\n289, 317 (2001) (quoting Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244,\n\n257 (1994)).      Still, we agree with the Eighth Circuit that the new\n\nstatute applies to appeals pending as of the effective date of the\n\nstatute.    See United States v. Aguilar-Lopez, 329 F.3d 960, 962-63\n\n(8th Cir. 2003).        Subject to constitutionally-based retroactivity\n\nconcerns, it is certainly within Congress's power to change a\n\nstandard of review.        See, e.g., Hines v. Sec'y of Dep't of Health\n\n& Human Servs., 940 F.2d 1518, 1523 (Fed. Cir. 1991); Consumers\n\nUnion of U.S. v. FTC, 801 F.2d 417 (D.C. Cir. 1986); cf. Bierce v.\n\nWaterhouse, 219 U.S. 320, 336-37 (1911).                 Much of the conduct\n\nregulated by this part of the PROTECT Act is that of the courts of\n\nappeals (and indirectly, the district courts now under closer\n\nscrutiny), and that involves conduct dating from April 30, 2003\n\nforward.\n\n\n                                      -45-\n\f          Thurston's fall-back argument is that applying a changed\n\nstandard of review to a case already on appeal would have an\n\nimpermissible effect on him under the Supreme Court's retroactivity\n\njurisprudence.   See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 264.   Not so.   The change\n\nof a standard of appellate review is one in procedure for the\n\ncourts; procedural changes that do not affect substantial rights\n\nare not usually considered retroactive. This legislation is little\n\ndifferent than the Supreme Court's changing the standard of review\n\nby directing the courts of appeals to decide ultimate Fourth\n\nAmendment questions by de novo review.        See Ornelas v. United\n\nStates, 517 U.S. 690, 697 (1996).      When the Supreme Court applies\n\na rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the\n\ncontrolling interpretation that must be applied \"retroactively\" to\n\nall criminal cases on direct review.      See Harper v. Va. Dep't of\n\nTaxation, 509 U.S. 86, 95 (1993) (citing Griffith v. Kentucky, 479\n\nU.S. 314, 322 (1987)).   Changing the appellate standard of review,\n\nas done here, could upset no legitimate reliance interest by a\n\ndefendant,17 could not have induced alteration of the behavior that\n\nled to the crime, and could not have upset settled expectations.\n\nWe see no unfairness to defendants in Congress's requiring a closer\n\nlook by appellate courts at whether a district court committed an\n\nerror in deciding that the guidelines permitted a departure. It is\n\n\n     17\n       In Thurston's case, there could be no reliance interest in\nany event, since this court used a de novo standard of review at\nthe time he committed the crime.\n\n                                -46-\n\fthe   substance         of   the   sentencing        rules,    both    Guidelines    and\n\nstatutory, that impacts defendants.\n\n            Thurston makes a cursory argument that the PROTECT Act\n\npresents serious constitutional separation-of-powers questions. At\n\nthe request of the Senate, the Chief Justice, expressing the views\n\nof the U.S. Judicial Conference, did advise the Senate of the\n\nConference's       opposition         to    portions     of    the    bill,   including\n\nalteration of the standard of review.                         See Letter from Chief\n\nJustice William H. Rehnquist to Senator Patrick Leahy (undated),\n\navailable          at        http://www.nacdl.org/public.nsf/2cdd02b415ea\n\n3a64852566d6000daa79/departures/$FILE/Rehnquist_letter.pdf.                          The\n\nU.S. Sentencing Commission requested that Congress not act until\n\nthe Commission had the opportunity to analyze data and study the\n\nmatter.     See Letter from Judge Diana Murphy, Chair of the U.S.\n\nSentencing Commission, et al. to Senators Orrin Hatch and Patrick\n\nLeahy     (April        2,   2003),        available     at    http://www.nacdl.org/\n\npublic.nsf/2cdd02b415ea3a64852566d6000daa79/departures/$FILE/stcg\n\n_comm_current.pdf.            But judicial opposition to legislation on\n\npolicy    grounds       is   one   thing,      and     unconstitutionality      of   the\n\nlegislation is another.            No real theory of unconstitutionality has\n\nbeen presented by this appeal, and so the issue is waived.                           See\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n\n\n\n                                             -47-\n\fb.   Application of De Novo Standard of Review\n\n            i.     Disparity With Co-Defendant\n\n            The district court felt there was an unfair disparity\n\nbetween a five-year sentence of imprisonment for Thurston and the\n\nthree-year probation sentence for co-conspirator Isola.               It viewed\n\nIsola as \"the architect, at least the prime architect of this\n\nconspiracy.\"          Apparently the district court felt that Isola,\n\nThurston's superior, was the guiltier of the two, and that this\n\nfact overshadowed other differences between their cases.                   Isola\n\npled nolo contendere to willful blindness about the apolipoprotein\n\nconspiracy.\n\n            As the law of this circuit makes clear, basing the\n\ndeparture     on      grounds   of   disparity    in   sentence   alone   between\n\nThurston and Isola was beyond the district court's authority.\n\nUnited States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1448 (1st Cir. 1991); see\n\nalso United States v. Romolo, 937 F.2d 20, 25 n.5 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\nSidestepping circuit precedent, the district court referred to a\n\nstatute that requires a sentencing court to consider not only the\n\nCommission's Sentencing Guidelines and policy statements, but also\n\n\"the   need      to    avoid    unwarranted      sentence   disparities     among\n\ndefendants with similar records who have been found guilty of\n\nsimilar conduct.\"          18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6).          This provision was\n\nunchanged by the PROTECT Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -48-\n\f              Yet the same statute also requires that the court \"shall\n\nimpose a sentence of the kind, and within the range [of the\n\npertinent Guidelines], unless the court finds that there exists an\n\naggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree,\n\nnot    adequately      taken    into    consideration      by   the    Sentencing\n\nCommission.\"        18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1).        That is why, since as early\n\nas    1991,   this    court    has   interpreted    the   statute     to   preclude\n\nsentencing judges from departing downward based on \"a perceived\n\nneed to equalize sentencing outcomes for similarly situated co-\n\ndefendants, without more.\"             Wogan, 938 F.2d at 1448 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n              The \"more\" that is needed refers to circumstances not\n\nadequately considered by the Commission, and none have been shown\n\nhere with regard to disparity.             In the pre-Guidelines era, the\n\ndistrict court's attempt to avoid perceived unfairness would have\n\nhad greater weight.            The Guidelines bind us and they bind the\n\ndistrict court.         The downward departure based on disparity in\n\nsentences among co-defendants was impermissible.\n\n              ii.    Good Works\n\n              The second ground, based on Thurston's good works, poses\n\nthe most difficult issue in the case.                We have found disparity\n\nalone an impermissible ground; it is possible the trial court would\n\nnot have granted so extensive a departure based on good works\n\nalone.    It may also be that if the court had granted a modest\n\n\n                                        -49-\n\fdeparture on the second ground, the government would not have\n\nappealed.     But the trial court did not differentiate and the\n\ngovernment on appeal argues that any departure at all based on good\n\nworks (like the departure for disparity) was contrary to law.\n\n            The Sentencing Guidelines discourage downward departures\n\nfrom the normal sentencing range based on good works -- that is,\n\ncivic, charitable, or public service.     U.S.S.G. § 5H1.11.     Such\n\ndepartures are permitted only when the good works are exceptional.18\n\nSee United States v. Pereira, 272 F.3d 76, 80 (1st Cir. 2001).   The\n\ndistrict court based its finding that Thurston's good works were\n\nexceptional on Thurston's \"record of charitable work and community\n\nservice[, which is] unique, extensive and extraordinary.\"         The\n\ncourt continued, \"I think the record should reflect that in over\n\nfourteen years of sentencing defendants, it's my judgment that no\n\none had a more extraordinary devotion to charitable work, community\n\nservice, and especially . . . to his church.\"   Thurston is a member\n\nof the Church of Latter Day Saints, tithes ten percent of his\n\nincome (as his church encourages him to do), and devotes hours\n\nevery week to unpaid service with the church in a variety of\n\npositions. Letters from his fellow congregants characterize him as\n\n\n\n\n     18\n        Good works may also be considered in setting a sentence\nwithin the Guidelines range or in setting certain conditions. This\ndoes Thurston no good, however, since the applicable Guidelines\nrange is sixty-three to seventy-eight months, all above the\nstatutory maximum of sixty months.\n\n                                -50-\n\fa man of principle and impeccable character19 -– characterizations\n\nundermined, of course, by the jury's finding of guilt.                   In any\n\nevent, it     is    good   works,   objectively   measured,     and    not   good\n\ncharacter that is at issue.\n\n            In addition, Thurston has taken family members and others\n\ninto his home and has been helpful to his neighbors.             For example,\n\nthe parents of a woman undergoing rehabilitation at a local medical\n\ncenter stayed at Thurston's home for several weeks.                   On another\n\noccasion, Thurston and his family laid sod for an infirm neighbor.\n\nSave for his crime, Thurston appears to have lived a creditworthy\n\nlife.\n\n            The issue then becomes, as we engage in de novo review,\n\nthe point of reference by which to determine whether Thurston's\n\ngood works provide a basis for a departure.             Earlier, under Koon,\n\n518 U.S. 81, the very sensible rationale was that the district\n\ncourts, which saw far more sentencing cases than the courts of\n\nappeals, were better positioned to determine what was exceptional,\n\nand     appellate    courts    owed   deference    to    that    more     expert\n\ndetermination.       See id. at 96-100.      The PROTECT Act has abrogated\n\n\n\n      19\n        During the trial, numerous witnesses for both sides\ntestified to Thurston's reputation for honesty and integrity.\nDuring the sentencing phase, many of Thurston's friends and family\nmembers explicitly or implicitly said they thought the jury verdict\nwas incorrect.\n     Good character is covered by the aberrant behavior guidelines,\nand here is no claim on appeal that Thurston was entitled to a\ndeparture on those grounds.\n\n                                      -51-\n\fthat deference.          There are many policy arguments in favor of\n\ndeference to the district court, which were presented to Congress\n\nby the Judicial Conference of the United States.                      But Congress\n\nchose to decide the balance differently, expressing concern that\n\nthe departure rate for certain crimes and within certain districts\n\nthreatened to undermine the Guidelines regime.                     See, e.g., H.R.\n\nRep.         No.       108-66,          at      58-59,           available        at\n\nhttp://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/T?&report=hr066&dbname=cp10\n\n8&;    149   Cong.    Rec.     H3059,   H3066   (daily     ed.    April   10,   2003)\n\n(statement of Rep. Sensenbrenner).\n\n             In      reviewing     de    novo    whether     any    departure      is\n\npermissible, the PROTECT Act and the case law require courts of\n\nappeals to consider three sources: other decisions under the\n\nGuidelines; the Commission's relevant Guidelines and statements;\n\nand the congressional purposes behind sentencing.                  Even before the\n\nPROTECT Act, the question of whether a discouraged factor was\n\npresent in an exceptional way was determined in large part by\n\ncomparison with other Guidelines cases.                 See Pereira, 272 F.3d at\n\n80 (citing Koon, 518 U.S. at 98).             Such other cases are not limited\n\nto cases involving convictions for the same offense.                      See United\n\nStates v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1324 (1st Cir. 1994).                        Second,\n\nappellate     courts     are    also    to   consider    policy    statements    and\n\nofficial commentary by the Sentencing Commission.                     18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(b). Third, Section 401 of the PROTECT Act instructs courts of\n\n\n                                         -52-\n\fappeals to consider whether a departure is consistent with the\n\npurposes of sentencing stated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2) -- that is,\n\nretribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation.\n\n             As to comparisons with other reported cases, each side\n\nhas   some   circuit     authority   in    support   of    its   position;    the\n\ngovernment's cases are a closer fit.            The government cites United\n\nStates v. Morken, 133 F.3d 628, 629-30 (8th Cir. 1998) (divided\n\ncourt reverses a downward departure because good works are not\n\nexceptional for someone of defendant's income and preeminence in a\n\nsmall town); United States v. Kolbach, 38 F.3d 832, 838-39 (6th\n\nCir. 1994) (vacating a good works departure because \"it is usual\n\nand ordinary, in the prosecution of similar white collar crimes\n\ninvolving high-ranking corporate executives . . . to find that a\n\ndefendant was involved as a leader in community charities, civic\n\norganizations,     and     church    efforts\");      and   United    States     v.\n\nHaverstat,    22   F.3d   790,   795-96      (8th   Cir.   1994)    (vacating   a\n\ndeparture for good works where the defendant's charitable and\n\nvolunteer activities did not make him an atypical defendant in an\n\nantitrust price-fixing case).\n\n             In United States v. Bogdan, 284 F.3d 324 (1st Cir. 2002),\n\nthis court found no basis for a downward departure for a caring and\n\ngenerous father who made efforts to improve his relationship with\n\nhis ex-wife and supported her financially and who was introspective\n\nand remorseful about his crime.           Id. at 329-30.    When the district\n\n\n                                      -53-\n\fcourt again granted a downward departure because it thought the\n\nsentence \"unconscionable,\" this court again reversed.                 United\n\nStates v. Bogdan, 302 F.3d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n              In turn, Thurston relies on several circuit decisions\n\naffirming good works downward departures.           These cases are less\n\npersuasive than those cited by the government, since the circuit\n\ncourts merely hold that there was no abuse of discretion and since\n\nthe facts are less analogous.         See United States v. Serafini, 233\n\nF.3d 758, 775-76 (3d Cir. 2000) (affirming a downward departure\n\nbased on exceptional charitable works in light of the defendant's\n\nmeager resources); United States v. Woods, 159 F.3d 1132, 1136-37\n\n(8th Cir. 1998) (in a bankruptcy fraud case involving a defendant\n\nwho transformed the lives of two girls and cared for an elderly\n\nfriend,   a    one-level   downward    departure   was   not   an   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion); United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 662-63 (2d Cir.\n\n1996) (no abuse of discretion to depart downward based on a\n\ncombination of medical condition and civic good deeds).             We would\n\nfind the expertise reflected in the decisions of the district\n\ncourts to be useful as well in determining whether particular good\n\nworks are exceptional.       But the parties have not cited any such\n\ncases.\n\n              As the government's cases indicate, corporate executives\n\nare usually better situated to make large financial contributions\n\nand are often expected, by virtue of their positions, to engage in\n\n\n                                      -54-\n\fcivic and    charitable       activities.   The    ability   to    make   large\n\ncontributions should not keep a defendant out of jail.             See United\n\nStates v. McHan, 920 F.2d 244, 248 (4th Cir. 1990).                 And those\n\nwhose place in life does not give them similar opportunities should\n\nnot be disadvantaged.         See U.S.S.G. § 5H1.10.\n\n            For similar reasons, we would be reluctant to find a\n\ndefendant's good works exceptional solely on the basis of actions\n\nthat were required or encouraged as a condition of membership in a\n\nreligious institution.          Such a result -- which would seemingly\n\nentitle all members in good standing to a downward departure --\n\ncould undercut the principle that religion (like socio-economic\n\nstatus) is a forbidden basis for departure. See U.S.S.G. § 5H1.10.\n\nOn the other hand, good works should not have less weight because\n\na defendant was motivated by religious belief. Thurston should not\n\nbe disadvantaged by his church involvement.               It would, in any\n\nevent, do a disservice to Thurston to categorize him entirely in\n\nterms of his economic or religious status. His good works predated\n\nhis executive status and continued over time; they exceeded the\n\nbare requirements for church membership; and they involved costs to\n\nhim in terms of time and effort.\n\n            In   sum,   the    comparison   to    other   case    law   is   not\n\ndispositive and is, in any event, only one part of the analysis.\n\nWe move on to the Guidelines and to the purposes of sentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -55-\n\f             Two salient principles emerge from the Guidelines: the\n\ngoal of parity between white collar and other criminal defendants\n\nand the goal of discouraging departures based on good works.\n\nCongress and the Sentencing Commission were clear that under the\n\npre-Guidelines regime, sentences for white collar crimes were too\n\nlenient.20      The    Sentencing   Commission     intended       to   \"equalize\n\npunishments for 'white collar' and 'blue collar' crime.\"                  United\n\nStates v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 955 (1st Cir. 1993) (Breyer, J.).\n\n             Viewing   the   departure    in   terms   of   the    purposes   of\n\nsentencing also militates against the departure.                  Thurston was\n\nconvicted of a serious crime, a massive fraud at public expense\n\ninvolving    deceit,    trickery,   and    sophistication.         The   federal\n\ngovernment spent approximately $249 billion on Medicare last year.\n\n\n     20\n        See Mary Kreiner Ramirez, Just in Crime: Guiding Economic\nCrime Reform After the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 34 Loy. U. Chi.\nL.J. 359, 372-76 (2003) (discussing the Sentencing Commission's\nconcern that white-collar crimes have been \"grossly under-\nsentenced\"); id. at 396-401 (collecting data on the under-\nsentencing of white-collar crimes and arguing that the prevalence\nof downward departures in white collar cases threatens to undermine\nthe integrity of the Sentencing Guidelines); see also Testimony of\nSentencing Commissioner Stephen Breyer Before the Senate Committee\non the Judiciary, Oct. 22, 1987, reproduced in 146 PLI/Crim 811,\n824 (1987) (\"[T]he Commission considers present sentencing\npractices, in which white collar criminals receive probation more\noften than other offenders who committed crimes of comparable\nseverity, to be unfair.\"); 28 U.S.C. § 994(m) (2000) (\"The\n[Sentencing] Commission shall insure that the guidelines reflect\nthe fact that, in many cases, current sentences do not accurately\nreflect the seriousness of the offense.\"). The recent enactment of\nenhanced penalties for many white collar crimes only underscores\nCongress's disinclination towards leniency for white collar\ncriminals. See Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-204,\n§§ 801-1107, 116 Stat. 745, 800-10.\n\n                                    -56-\n\fOne group has estimated that about three percent of the $1.4\n\ntrillion the country spent on health care in 2001 was lost to\n\nfraud.21       \"A Sick Business,\" The Economist, June 28, 2003, at 64\n\n(citing data from National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association); see\n\nNational Health Care Anti-Fraud Association, Health Care Fraud, at\n\np.   2,    available    at   http://www.nhcaa.org/pdf/all_about_hcf.pdf\n\n(n.d.).        The retribution and deterrent interests in sentencing\n\nwould     be    significantly   undercut    by   permitting   a    good   works\n\ndeparture on this record.\n\n               \"Good works\" do not stand alone.     They must be evaluated\n\nin the context of the crime and the purposes of sentencing.               Health\n\ncare fraud, a form of white collar fraud, is a serious national\n\nproblem, affecting the financial integrity of programs meant to aid\n\ntens of millions of people in need of health care.                Every dollar\n\nlost to fraud is a dollar that could have provided medical care to\n\nthe elderly or the disabled.         By definition, Medicare fraud will\n\nmost likely be white collar fraud, committed by educated people\n\nwith responsible jobs.          Thurston's executive position at Damon,\n\nwhich gave him the resources to undertake many of his charitable\n\n\n     21\n        For other circuit court cases involving Medicare and\nMedicaid fraud, see United States v. Baxtonbrown-Smith, 278 F.3d\n1348 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (fraud exceeding two million dollars); United\nStates v. Liss, 265 F.3d 1220 (11th Cir. 2001) (kickback scheme for\nreferrals); United States v. Regueiro, 240 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir.\n2001) (fraud exceeding fifteen million dollars); United States v.\nMcClendon, 195 F.3d 598 (11th Cir. 1999) (fraud exceeding three\nmillion dollars); and United States v. Polin, 194 F.3d 863 (7th\nCir. 1999) (Medicare kickback scheme).\n\n                                     -57-\n\fworks, also enabled him to perform the crime.               Were it not for the\n\nstatutory maximum, he would, under the Guidelines, have been\n\nsentenced to imprisonment for more than five years.                   A five-year\n\nterm of imprisonment in light of the nature of the crime reflects\n\nthe seriousness of the offense, the need for congruity with \"blue\n\ncollar\" crime, and the need to deter other executives from similar\n\nlaw-breaking.        Thurston's admirable good works simply are not so\n\nexceptional, in context, as to provide a basis to depart.\n\n              The    government's    argument     that   Thurston's       conduct\n\nwarranted an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice based on\n\nperjury at trial need not be resolved, given our disposition of the\n\nother issues.         The statute caps his period of incarceration at\n\nsixty months.        It is noteworthy, though, that Thurston's testimony\n\non key matters of fact was contradicted by multiple witnesses.\n\nc.   Fine\n\n              The government argues that the sentencing judge erred by\n\nfailing to impose a fine on Thurston in accordance with the\n\nGuidelines. Thurston argued, and the district court accepted, that\n\nhe   should    not    receive   a   fine   because   that     would    create   an\n\nunacceptable        disparity   between    his   sentence    and   that   of    co-\n\ndefendant Isola.        Sentence disparity is an unacceptable basis for\n\nrefusing to impose a fine and is plain error for the reasons\n\ndiscussed earlier.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -58-\n\f           Thurston contends that the government has forfeited its\n\nargument that a fine must be imposed by failing to object after the\n\njudge ruled.       The government earlier took the position that a fine\n\nmust be imposed and also argued that the court could not refuse to\n\nimpose a fine on the basis of disparity -- the only argument\n\nThurston presented.           In these circumstances, the issue was not\n\nforfeited.     See Gallant, 306 F.3d at 1187-88 (holding that a\n\nsentencing issue was not forfeited as a result of counsel's failure\n\nto object after the court's ruling); cf. United States v. Meserve,\n\n271 F.3d 314, 325 (1st Cir. 2001) (motion to strike unnecessary to\n\npreserve evidentiary issue where party objected prior to trial\n\ncourt's ruling).          Even were this an instance of forfeiture, the\n\ndistrict court committed plain error in its rationale.\n\n             Before    this    court,   Thurston     attempts     to    defend       the\n\ndecision not to impose a fine on the basis that the statutory\n\ndefinition    of    his    crime,   which      provides   that   a     fine    may   be\n\nassigned, trumps the Guidelines, which provide that a fine must be\n\nassigned   barring        special   circumstances.        The    crime    of    which\n\nThurston was convicted, 18 U.S.C. § 371, provides for a prison\n\nterm, a fine, or both.        By contrast, U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(a) says, \"The\n\ncourt shall impose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant\n\nestablishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become\n\nable to pay any fine.\"          (emphasis added).         The defendant did not\n\nestablish, or even seek to establish, inability to pay.                              The\n\n\n                                        -59-\n\fsentencing judge made no finding, implicit or explicit, that\n\nThurston could not pay.      The PSR estimated that Thurston had a net\n\nworth   of   over   $1.5   million,   and    the   minimum     fine   under   the\n\nGuidelines was $12,500.\n\n             Because the sentence fixed by U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(a) is\n\nwithin the range contemplated by 18 U.S.C. § 371, the Guideline is\n\nnot trumped by the statute.        See United States v. Page, 84 F.3d 38,\n\n43 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"There is no reason why the Guidelines may not\n\nmake their own classifications within the statutes, and hence\n\ndefinitions which the courts must observe, so long as these are not\n\ninternally inconsistent or in violation of the Constitution or a\n\nfederal   statute.\").       Here   there     is   no   inconsistency    and   the\n\ndistrict court was required to impose a fine.\n\n                              V.    Conclusion\n\n             Thurston's conviction is affirmed.           Thurston's sentence\n\nis   vacated;   the   downward     departure      based   on   good   works   and\n\npurported disparity is reversed; and the order that no fine be\n\nimposed is reversed.       The case is remanded for imposition of the\n\nstatutory maximum sentence of sixty months in prison and for\n\nimposition of an appropriate fine.           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -60-\n\f",

Loucks, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, U.S. Attorney, and Susan G. Winkler and Gary\nS. Katzmann, Assistant U.S. Attorneys, were on brief for the United\nStates.\n\n          Matthew D. Brown, with whom Joseph P. Russoniello and\nCooley Godward LLP were on brief for Thurston.\n\n\n                           August 4, 2003\n\f               LYNCH, Circuit Judge. A jury convicted William Thurston,\n\na vice president of Damon Clinical Testing Laboratories, Inc., of\n\nconspiring to defraud the Medicare program of over five million\n\ndollars. The fraud charged involved the manipulation of physicians\n\ninto       ordering   unnecessary    ferritin   blood   tests1   for   Medicare\n\nbeneficiaries, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 (2000).\n\n               The essence of the scheme charged was that Damon, through\n\nThurston and others, bundled the ferritin blood test -- previously\n\nordered by doctors less than two percent of the time -- into a\n\npanel of blood tests known as the LabScan -- which was ordered\n\nthirty to forty percent of the time.              When doctors or patients\n\n(instead of insurers) paid for the bundled LabScan, Damon provided\n\nthe ferritin test for free, leading doctors to believe there was no\n\nextra charge for this test.            Doctors were not told that, when\n\nMedicare paid for the bundled LabScan, Medicare was charged extra\n\nfor the ferritin test.              Indeed, both a letter and marketing\n\nmaterials indicated the added ferritin test was \"free\"; that is,\n\nthat there was no charge beyond the standard LabScan charge. Those\n\nunnecessary ferritin tests were not free to Medicare.                     Damon\n\ncharged Medicare roughly $21 per ferritin test on top of the\n\napproximately $24 charged for the LabScan.              Nor were doctors told\n\nthat the ferritin test could be ordered separately; the test\n\n\n       1\n       The ferritin iron test measures the number of atoms per\nmolecule of circulating ferritin. Ferritin is a binding protein\nwhich delivers iron to iron storage cells.\n\n                                       -2-\n\frequisition form did not offer that option.                       The physicians, then,\n\nwere induced to order and to certify as medically necessary a large\n\nnumber of ferritin tests which were not medically necessary.\n\n             The government's theory was that Damon did this to offset\n\nMedicare's     1988     reduction         in    reimbursement        rates    of   sixteen\n\npercent, which was projected to cause Damon an estimated annual\n\nloss of $800,000 in revenues.              In just one of Thurston's labs, the\n\norders   for        ferritin      tests    were       expected      to     increase     from\n\napproximately three hundred per month to roughly ten thousand per\n\nmonth.   Thurston testified that he was innocent, and neither had\n\nknowledge      of    nor    responsibility            for   key    components      of    the\n\nconspiracy.     The jury disagreed.\n\n             Although the sentencing guidelines called for a sentence\n\nof   sixty-three       to    seventy-eight            months,     the    district     court\n\nsentenced Thurston to only three months' imprisonment.                          It did so\n\nby granting a downward departure to \"correct\" a perceived disparity\n\nbetween a five-year sentence of imprisonment for Thurston and the\n\nsentence of three years' probation given to the company President,\n\nJoseph Isola,         who   had    pled    nolo       contendere     and     assisted    the\n\ngovernment. Its second ground for departure was its sense that the\n\ngood   works    Thurston       did    for       his    church      and   community      were\n\nextraordinary.\n\n             This sentence outraged the prosecutors, who appealed,\n\narguing that the district court lacked the power to depart downward\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\ffor any of the reasons it gave, and that, even if a departure were\n\nappropriate, the extent of the departure was excessive.        The\n\ngovernment also appeals the district court's failure to impose a\n\nfine, on the basis that the Sentencing Guidelines, if not the\n\nstatute, mandated a fine.   Finally, the prosecution argues that if\n\nsome departure for good works was warranted, the district court was\n\nrequired to address an issue it avoided: the government's request\n\nfor an upward departure on the basis that Thurston had obstructed\n\njustice by committing perjury on the witness stand.\n\n          Thurston also appeals, arguing that the conviction must\n\nbe vacated because the prosecution was barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations, because he was entitled to a jury instruction and to\n\nacquittal on the basis that he reasonably interpreted the law to\n\nmean he could rely on the physicians' certifications of medical\n\nnecessity, and because of other errors.      In addition, Thurston\n\nargues his sentence was too high because the sentencing base\n\noffense level calculation for amount of loss, either actual or\n\nintended, was unproven and excessive.    Thurston also defends the\n\ndownward departure.\n\n          Several important issues are raised by these appeals.\n\nThe government's appeal requires us to address the effect of the\n\nnew Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of\n\nChildren Today Act of 2003 (PROTECT Act), Pub. L. No. 108-21, 117\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fStat. 650,2 on the standard the courts of appeals use to review\n\ndownward departure decisions by district judges in sentencing, as\n\nwell as the availability of a downward departure for a record of\n\ngood works, U.S.S.G. § 5H1.11.           Thurston's appeal invites, inter\n\nalia,     clarification      of   the    defense     doctrine    concerning    a\n\ndefendant's reasonable interpretation of the law; the issue of when\n\na statute of limitations defense must be raised; the ramifications\n\nof a trial judge's failure to respond to jury instructions proposed\n\nby counsel; the evidence needed to show an intended loss; and the\n\nquestion of whether fines are mandatory.\n\n            In   the   end   we   sustain     the   conviction   but   find   the\n\nsentence was in error.\n\n                                   I.    Facts\n\n            We state the facts as the jury could reasonably have\n\nfound them, including a fair description of the defense evidence.\n\nA.   Background\n\n            Medicare provides certain medical services and care,\n\nincluding clinical laboratory testing services, to persons aged\n\nsixty-five and older and to persons with disabilities. At the time\n\nof the conspiracy, Medicare was administered by the Health Care\n\nFinancing Administration (HCFA), a division of the U.S. Department\n\nof Health and Human Services. HCFA in turn contracted with private\n\n\n\n      2\n      This Act is also known as the Amber Alert bill. It includes\nchanges put forward in the so-called Feeney Amendment.\n\n                                        -5-\n\finsurance companies (\"carriers\" and \"intermediaries\") to handle\n\nclaims for reimbursement to Medicare program beneficiaries.                      By\n\nlaw, Medicare only reimburses clinical laboratory services if those\n\nservices were medically necessary for the treatment or diagnosis of\n\na beneficiary's illness or injury.                42 U.S.C. § 1395y(a)(1)(A)\n\n(2000); see also 42 C.F.R. § 424.10(a) (1988).                 Medicare did not\n\ngenerally reimburse screening tests.                Medicare reimbursed one-\n\nhundred percent of the cost of necessary clinical blood tests.\n\n           Damon was, at the time, a Massachusetts corporation that\n\nprovided   clinical      laboratory   testing       services    to    physicians,\n\nhospitals, health maintenance organizations, and their patients\n\nnationwide.    Approximately thirty percent of Damon's revenues were\n\nfrom Medicare.     Damon owned and operated a national system of\n\nclinical laboratories, and Damon was an approved Medicare provider.\n\nWhen Damon    billed     the    Medicare    program,   it    submitted    to     the\n\ncarriers a HCFA 1500 form saying that it certified the lab tests\n\nwere medically necessary.         Physicians did not see those bills.\n\n           Thurston served as Regional Vice President of Damon from\n\n1987 to 1990, and was responsible during all or part of this time\n\nfor Damon's regional laboratories in Newbury Park, California;\n\nPhoenix; Chicago; and San Francisco. His office was at the Newbury\n\nPark lab; he traveled to the other labs and was in regular phone\n\ncontact.      Thurston    was    promoted    to   Senior    Vice     President    of\n\nOperations in 1990.            Thereafter, he relocated to the company\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fheadquarters in Needham, Massachusetts and supervised only the San\n\nFrancisco lab.      Another company purchased Damon in August 1993;\n\nThurston later switched employers and moved to Utah.\n\nB.    Theories of Prosecution and Defense\n\n              The government's theory was that the defendants tricked\n\ndoctors   into    ordering     medically     unnecessary    tests,      for   which\n\nMedicare paid.       Damon added little-used tests to more popular\n\npanels of tests; it then tricked doctors by concealing that the\n\npanels could be ordered without the added tests and that Medicare\n\nwas   being    charged   for    the   tests.       To   conceal    from   doctors\n\nthat Medicare was being charged, and to encourage doctors to order\n\nferritin tests regardless of medical necessity, the defendants\n\ncharged doctors and patients little or no extra fee for the added\n\ntests; provided literature saying that ferritin was provided free;\n\notherwise failed to disclose to doctors the cost to Medicare of the\n\nexpanded LabScan; and made it difficult to order the bundled test\n\nwithout ferritin.\n\n              The defense theories were that there was no conspiracy\n\nand, if there were, then Thurston was not a knowing participant.\n\nThe defense contended that Damon complied with existing Medicare\n\nregulations,     which   neither      prohibited    bundling      nor   imposed   a\n\nrequirement on the lab to disregard a physician's certification\n\nthat tests were medically necessary.            It further argued that even\n\nif Thurston's interpretation of the regulations was incorrect, it\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fwas objectively reasonable, and so Thurston lacked the required\n\ncriminal intent.    Thurston's defense was also that any fraud was\n\ncarried out   by   his    subordinates,    without   his   knowledge.   He\n\ntestified that he did not instruct the labs to add ferritin; did\n\nnot authorize or condone any decision to forego a fee increase for\n\ndoctors or private-pay patients on the expanded LabScan; did not\n\ninstruct subordinates to conceal that doctors could order a LabScan\n\nwithout ferritin; and had nothing to do with requisition forms or\n\nparticular pieces of marketing literature.\n\nC.   Evidence of Conspiracy to Defraud\n\n1.   Addition of Ferritin\n\n           In late 1987, HCFA announced that effective April 1,\n\n1988, Medicare would reduce by almost sixteen percent the fees paid\n\nto laboratories, including Damon, for providing clinical laboratory\n\nservices to beneficiaries.        If Damon maintained its existing\n\npractices and fee structure, then Damon would lose $800,000 in\n\nrevenues during the first year alone, as Thurston knew.            Of that\n\namount, more than $500,000 of the annual losses would occur at\n\nThurston's four regional laboratories.\n\n           There   were     corporate     discussions,     which   included\n\nThurston, about how to offset this loss.        As a result, Damon added\n\nits ferritin test to the LabScan, a panel of more than a dozen\n\nblood chemistry tests performed by a single machine on one blood\n\nsample.   The ferritin test was performed on separate equipment.\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fDamon bundled ferritin with the LabScan from 1988 to at least mid-\n\n1993.    The LabScan had been requested on at least thirty-five to\n\nforty percent of the orders submitted to Thurston's regional\n\nlaboratories.     By contrast, doctors rarely ordered the ferritin\n\ntest.    The general manager of one of the laboratories Thurston\n\noversaw estimated that only one to two percent of the orders for\n\nblood tests included a request for a ferritin test.\n\n           Nothing in the medical literature at the time showed\n\nferritin was necessary for all persons receiving LabScans. Indeed,\n\nit was not.       A family practitioner testified that he needed\n\nferritin less than ten percent of the time it was included as part\n\nof the LabScan.    Similarly, an internist testified that he needed\n\nthe ferritin test for very few of his Medicare patients.\n\n           The plan to add ferritin to the LabScan was discussed at\n\na general managers meeting in January 1988 and at a mid-year\n\nfinancial meeting for the western region in March 1988.        Thurston\n\nattended   both   meetings.   In   late   March,   Thurston   personally\n\napproved the addition of ferritin to the LabScans offered by the\n\nNewbury Park, San Francisco, and Phoenix labs.3 Thurston initially\n\nacquiesced when the Phoenix lab sought permission not to add\n\n\n     3\n       There was abundant evidence that Thurston instructed his\nsubordinates to add ferritin. For example, the general manager of\nthe Chicago lab had contemporaneous notes of a conversation with\nThurston in 1988 indicating that Thurston told him to add ferritin\nto the LabScan.     The manager of the San Francisco lab also\ntestified that Thurston called him and told him to add the ferritin\ntest to the LabScan.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fferritin; in August 1988, however, after Thurston saw the financial\n\nresults from the addition of ferritin at his other labs, Thurston\n\nordered the Phoenix lab to add the test to the LabScan.\n\n            Thurston presented evidence that the decision to add\n\nferritin    was   made   at   a   lower   level   for   legitimate    reasons.\n\nThurston and Isola testified that at the general managers meeting\n\nin early 1988, management decided to allow individual laboratories\n\nto determine whether to add ferritin to the LabScan.                 There was\n\nalso testimony that Damon's sales force made requests to the sales\n\nmanagers and general managers of individual labs to add ferritin to\n\nthe LabScan, on the grounds that the new test would make the panel\n\nmore competitive.\n\n2.   Differential Charging for Ferritin Test\n\na.   Thurston's Knowledge of Price Differential\n\n            Medicare provided one reimbursement for the ferritin test\n\nand a separate reimbursement for the LabScan panel.            In 1988, for\n\nexample, Medicare paid $24.05 for a LabScan and $20.86 for a\n\nferritin test.\n\n            Thurston's labs submitted to him capital expenditure\n\nrequests (CERs) to help with the decision whether to bundle the\n\ntests.     CERs were financial projections comparing the additional\n\nrevenues (from Medicare reimbursements) and costs (partly from the\n\npurchase of new equipment) that would result from the addition of\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fferritin to the LabScan.4       These CERs assumed there would be no\n\nincrease in the charge to doctors and patients for a LabScan with\n\nferritin.    Thurston discussed and then signed the CERs.               They\n\nprojected losses of revenue from doctors and patients (who would\n\nreceive free ferritin tests) and massive increases in revenue from\n\nMedicare reimbursements.      One lab, for example, projected that the\n\nnumber of ferritin tests performed for Medicare beneficiaries would\n\ngrow from 25 per month to 1,946 per month -- increasing revenues by\n\n$10,308 per month.     Overall, Thurston's labs projected that they\n\nwould increase their Medicare reimbursements by approximately $1.16\n\nmillion per year by adding ferritin to the LabScan; if multiplied\n\nby five years, this increase would be $5.8 million.            The capital\n\nexpenditure requests were best-case projections, assuming that\n\nevery doctor who would otherwise have ordered a LabScan without\n\nferritin would now order a LabScan with ferritin.\n\n            Damon   sought   reimbursement   (at   different   rates)    for\n\nferritin tests from Medicare, CHAMPUS,5 and other insurers, but\n\nprovided them for free to doctors and patients.         Thurston said he\n\nwas unaware doctors were not being charged.        But Thurston approved\n\n\n\n     4\n       The defense argues that the CERs were prepared for the\nrelated purpose of justifying, to Damon executives, the purchase of\nequipment to carry out a higher volume of ferritin tests.\n     5\n       CHAMPUS is the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the\nUniformed Services, a health benefit and insurance program for\ndependants of military personnel that is administered by the\nDepartment of Defense.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fthe decision by a number of his labs to adopt this policy of\n\ndifferential pricing depending on the client, and the CERs assumed\n\nno price increase for doctors and patients.              Thurston instructed a\n\nsubordinate to add ferritin at no charge to doctors; Thurston was\n\npresent at a meeting in which another executive announced the no-\n\ncharge policy; and Thurston received a memo saying that there was\n\nno price increase for doctors at a lab he oversaw.                      Witnesses\n\ntestified that physicians are highly price-sensitive about charges\n\nfor lab work and might object to the automatic inclusion of\n\nferritin    unless    the   test    were   provided     for   free.     At   least\n\ninitially, many or all of Thurston's labs increased the charge to\n\nprivate insurance companies for a LabScan based on the addition of\n\nferritin.    However, any price increase for private insurers on the\n\nexpanded    LabScan   was    much   smaller     than    the   cost    increase   to\n\nMedicare.\n\n            Thurston presented evidence that two of his labs did\n\nincrease    the   price     for   physicians;    that    this   price    increase\n\nprovoked complaints by doctors; that he was informed of these\n\ncomplaints; and that he responded that doctors could not obtain a\n\nLabScan with ferritin unless they paid the higher price.                  He also\n\npresented evidence that the no-charge approach was a deviation from\n\ncorporate policy and was initiated by the heads of individual labs;\n\nthat he did not find out about any price differential until years\n\nafter it had been implemented; and that he sought to correct any\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fprice differential as soon as he discovered it. Thurston testified\n\nthat he did not authorize, condone, or ratify a decision not to\n\nincrease    the   price    of    the   LabScan       based   on    the   addition   of\n\nferritin.\n\nb.   Concealing Price Differential from Doctors\n\n            Thurston's labs took steps to conceal from doctors that,\n\nin addition to the LabScan charge, Medicare would pay an extra fee\n\nfor the ferritin tests.          No letters were sent to doctors advising\n\nthem that Medicare would be charged separately for the ferritin\n\ntest.   To the contrary, in April and May 1988, letters were sent to\n\nphysicians notifying them that the ferritin test was going to be\n\nautomatically added at \"no extra cost.\"                In Newbury Park, stickers\n\nwere    also   printed     and    added    to    physicians'         brochures      and\n\ndirectories saying, \"Ferritin Automatically Included at No Charge.\"\n\nOf course, as to Medicare patients, these statements were untrue.\n\n            Thurston      testified    that     he    did    not   pre-approve      the\n\nletters or stickers saying ferritin would be provided free to\n\ncustomers.     Thurston portrayed himself as a hands-off manager who\n\ntrusted subordinates to build in a charge to physicians and to\n\naccurately promote the expanded LabScan.\n\n            Several physicians testified they were initially unaware\n\nthat Damon charged Medicare for the ferritin component of the\n\nexpanded LabScan.      A number of Damon customers protested, and even\n\nswitched labs, when they belatedly discovered Damon was charging\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fMedicare for ferritin tests conducted as part of the LabScan. When\n\ndoctors told Damon sales representatives that they did not need the\n\nadditional test, some were told that a LabScan without ferritin\n\nwould cost more than a LabScan with ferritin.                   A major client\n\nreferred Damon to a newspaper article criticizing the practice of\n\nbundling tests into panels and profiles, and warned Damon that its\n\nfailure     to   educate    doctors    about     the    composition     of     and\n\nalternatives to its panels would subject it to ongoing criticism.\n\nThurston was informed of these complaints, which were written up in\n\nmonthly management reports he received in 1989 and 1990.                Despite\n\nthese complaints, Thurston did not cause a letter to be sent to\n\ndoctors   informing    them   of   the   extra    charge      for   ferritin      to\n\nMedicare.\n\n            Damon    also   collaborated       with    HMOs    operating     on   a\n\ncapitation basis (i.e., paying a flat monthly fee for each HMO\n\nmember) to reduce utilization of bundled tests such as the LabScan.\n\nFor example, one of Thurston's labs added to its HMO requisition\n\nform a checkbox for a LabScan without ferritin.               Damon made no such\n\neffort to assist Medicare.\n\n3.   Availability of LabScan Without Ferritin\n\n            Thurston instructed subordinates to take specific steps\n\nthat hid the fact that the LabScan could be ordered without\n\nferritin and made it difficult for doctors to order the LabScan\n\nseparately.      For example, Thurston told the general manager of the\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fNewbury Park lab not to advertise or promote the fact that doctors\n\ncould still order a LabScan without ferritin.   Similarly, Thurston\n\nhelped make the decision to omit, from the Newbury Park letter\n\nannouncing to doctors the addition of ferritin to the LabScan, the\n\ntest code for ordering a LabScan without ferritin.    The standard\n\nrequisition forms used by Thurston's labs did not change following\n\nthe addition of ferritin to the LabScan; there was a checkbox for\n\nthe \"LabScan\" (which now included ferritin) but no box for the\n\n\"LabScan without ferritin\" or the \"LabScan with ferritin.\"\n\n          During the conspiracy period, there were at least two\n\nways for doctors to order the LabScan without ferritin. They could\n\nhandwrite such an order on a standard requisition form, or they\n\ncould request and obtain a customized requisition form with a\n\ncheckbox for the LabScan without ferritin. A number of doctors and\n\ninstitutions took advantage of these options.\n\n          Thurston testified that he did not tell anyone to conceal\n\nor refrain from advertising that the LabScan could be ordered\n\nwithout ferritin. There was testimony that, after Thurston learned\n\nin 1991 that the front of a requisition form used by one of his\n\nlabs did not disclose the inclusion of ferritin in the LabScan, he\n\ninstructed a subordinate to list it on the front and the form was\n\nso amended.\n\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f4.   Apolipoprotein\n\n           Damon also added an apolipoprotein test to its coronary\n\nrisk panel in 1989.     Before apolipoprotein was added to the panel,\n\nclients ordered it very rarely.         The standard requisition forms\n\nDamon used after adding apolipoprotein to the panel also did not\n\noffer a checkbox for a coronary risk panel without apolipoprotein.\n\nFollowing the addition of apolipoprotein, the cost to doctors of\n\nthe coronary risk panel increased by five dollars.                  Medicare\n\nreimbursed apolipoprotein separately at a rate well above five\n\ndollars.     Thurston    participated     in   the    decisions    about   the\n\naddition, the requisition forms for, and the extra charges for\n\napolipoprotein.\n\nD.   Thurston's \"Reasonable Interpretation\" as Evidence of Lack of\n     Criminal Intent\n\n           Thurston presented evidence that from 1988 to 1993 it was\n\nan industry-wide practice for labs to rely on the doctors who\n\nordered    tests   to   make   determinations    of    medical    necessity.\n\nBecause, prior to 1994, doctors did not normally share their\n\ndiagnoses with labs, labs did not have the information required to\n\ngauge medical necessity. Damon employees did not believe that they\n\ncertified tests as medically necessary when they submitted HCFA\n\n1500 forms with Medicare bills.      Instead, they believed it was the\n\ndoctors who ordered LabScans who made the certification.\n\n            Two expert witnesses testified that it was appropriate in\n\n1988 to include ferritin in a blood chemistry panel.             The bundling\n\n                                   -16-\n\fof   different     tests       into   panels      was   lawful   under   Medicare\n\nregulations. There was testimony that technological changes during\n\nthe 1980s made it possible to automate the ferritin test, which\n\npresumably made it much cheaper to conduct.                  Witnesses for both\n\nsides testified that by 1988 some of Damon's competitors offered\n\nferritin as part of their blood chemistry panel and so Damon added\n\nthe test to stay competitive.\n\n                           II.    Procedural History\n\nA.   Indictment and Trial\n\n           On January 22, 1998, a thirty-nine paragraph single-count\n\nindictment charged Thurston and three other former Damon executives\n\n-- Joseph Isola, Beno Kon, and Gerald Cullen -- with conspiring to\n\ndefraud HCFA in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3716 by causing doctors to\n\norder unnecessary tests by adding a test for ferritin to a pre-\n\nexisting panel of diagnostic blood tests, and by adding a test for\n\napolipoproteins     to     a   profile     used    to   assess   coronary   artery\n\ndisease.   The conspiracy period was from July 1987 to August 1993.\n\n           Isola, President of Damon, pled no contest and, pursuant\n\nto his plea agreement, was sentenced to three years' probation and\n\na    one-hundred    dollar       special     assessment.         Kon,    Corporate\n\nController, died during the proceedings.                   Cullen, Senior Vice\n\nPresident for Operations, was tried before the district court in\n\n\n\n      6\n       Damon was separately indicted for conspiracy to defraud\nHCFA, on the basis of the same events.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fOctober   2001    and    acquitted   at   the   close    of    the    government's\n\nevidence.    In addition, Damon pled guilty on October 11, 1996 to\n\nconspiracy to defraud by bundling ferritin with the LabScan and\n\napolipoprotein with the cardiac risk panel.                    The company was\n\nsentenced to pay a $35,273,141 fine, and later entered into a civil\n\nsettlement under which it paid the United States and the state\n\nMedicaid programs an additional $83,756,904.\n\n            Thurston was tried before a jury in November and December\n\n2001.     The    trial   lasted   three    weeks.       At    the    close    of   the\n\ngovernment's evidence, the district court granted Thurston's motion\n\nfor judgment of acquittal as to the indictment's apolipoprotein\n\nallegations, ordered these allegations stricken, and explained to\n\nthe jury that only the ferritin allegations remained.                        The jury\n\nfound Thurston guilty.       Thurston's subsequent motions for judgment\n\nof acquittal and for new trial were denied. The procedural rulings\n\nat trial which Thurston attacks are described below.\n\nB.   Sentencing\n\n            The district court sentenced Thurston to three months'\n\nimprisonment (with a judicial recommendation that the term be\n\nserved in a halfway house), followed by twenty-four months of\n\nsupervised release (of which the first three months were to be\n\nserved in home detention).        The court imposed a one-hundred dollar\n\nspecial assessment and no fine.           The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) had\n\nrecommended a Total Offense Level of twenty-six and a Criminal\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fHistory Category of one. The PSR identified the base offense level\n\nas six.   It recommended a fourteen-level upward enhancement for an\n\nintended loss     of   at   least   five    million    dollars;    a    two-level\n\nenhancement for more than minimal planning; and a four-level\n\nenhancement for a leadership role.             It also suggested that an\n\nenhancement for obstruction of justice was appropriate, on the\n\ngrounds that Thurston perjured himself at his trial.                     The PSR\n\nrecommended      the   statutory    maximum        term   of    sixty     months'\n\nimprisonment and noted that both the statute and the guideline\n\nallowed for a fine.     It calculated that Thurston had a net worth of\n\n$1,526,904.\n\n           The    defense     contested      the    PSR's      recommendations.\n\nThurston requested a three-level decrease because the substantive\n\noffense of defrauding the United States was incomplete; a four-\n\nlevel decrease because Thurston was a minimal participant; and a\n\ntwo-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility.                    Thurston\n\nrequested a downward departure on the grounds that he had an\n\nextraordinary record of charitable work and community service; that\n\nthe offense constituted aberrant behavior; and that there was the\n\npotential for a large disparity with Isola's sentence.\n\n           The government argued that Thurston should receive a two-\n\nlevel upward enhancement for obstruction of justice. Otherwise, it\n\naccepted the recommendations of the PSR.              The parties agreed that\n\nany restitution had been made by Damon, the corporate defendant.\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f            The district court sentenced Thurston at a hearing on\n\nJune 26, 2002 to three months' imprisonment, a period of supervised\n\nrelease, and no fine.        The district court granted a fourteen-level\n\nenhancement   for      the   size   of    the    intended    loss,   see U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2F1.1(b)(0) (1992 version),7 a four-level enhancement for an\n\naggravated role in the offense, see U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a) (1992\n\nversion),    and   a   two-level       enhancement     for   more    than   minimal\n\nplanning, see U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1(b)(2) (1992 version). The court did\n\nnot explicitly rule on the government's request for an obstruction\n\nof justice enhancement, see U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 (1992 version), or\n\nThurston's request for a three-level decrease for failure to show\n\ncompletion of the substantive offense, see § 2X1.1 (1992 version).\n\nThurston's    adjusted       offense     level   of   twenty-six     and    criminal\n\nhistory category of one yielded a guidelines sentencing range of\n\nsixty-three to seventy-eight months' imprisonment; this range was\n\ntrumped by the statutory maximum of sixty months for a violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 371.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1 was deleted by consolidation with U.S.S.G.\n§ 2B1.1 effective November 1, 2001.

Over the\n\ngovernment's objections and arguments, the district court then\n\ndeparted downward on the basis of Thurston's record of charitable\n\nwork and community service and the disparity between Thurston's and\n\nIsola's sentences.          The court then solicited the government's\n\nrecommendation about the extent of the departure.              The government\n\nresponded that, if the court chose to depart, then it should depart\n\nno further than the sentencing guidelines for a perjury conviction,\n\nwhich would be an offense level of twenty (six less than that of\n\nthe underlying offense), for a sentencing range of thirty-three to\n\nforty-one months' imprisonment.          The court then departed by at\n\nleast sixteen levels.\n\n            The     government   appealed     the   sentence    and   Thurston\n\nappealed his conviction and sentence.\n\n             III.     Thurston's Appeal from his Conviction\n\n            Thurston was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 371, which\n\nprovides:\n\n            If two or more persons conspire either to commit any\n            offense against the United States, or to defraud the\n            United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for\n            any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act\n            to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be\n            fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five\n            years, or both.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fA.   Statute of limitations\n\n           Thurston    argues    that   the    trial   court    erred   in    not\n\ngranting his post-verdict Rule 29 motion for acquittal, because the\n\ngovernment had not proved an overt act during the limitations\n\nperiod, and in not sua sponte instructing the jury on the statute\n\nof limitations.\n\n           The statute of limitations for 18 U.S.C. § 371 crimes is\n\nthe general five-year statute of limitations contained in 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3282.   Here, that five years ran back from January 22, 1998, the\n\ndate of the indictment, less the six weeks during which Thurston\n\nagreed to toll the limitation period.           The government, therefore,\n\nhad to prove an overt act was done on or after December 11, 1992.\n\nThe indictment properly alleged at least eight overt acts within\n\nthe limitations period.\n\n           Thurston    did   not    raise     the   defense    of   statute    of\n\nlimitations   either    before     or   at    trial,   did    not   request    an\n\ninstruction on the defense, and did not object when the judge\n\ninstructed without addressing the issue. Thurston first raised the\n\nissue by Rule 29 motion after the verdict.              The government says\n\nThurston raised the issue too late.                 There is a preliminary\n\nquestion of when such a motion should be raised, a question\n\naffecting our standard of review.\n\n           \"The statute of limitations is a defense and must be\n\nasserted on the trial by the defendant in criminal cases . . . .\"\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fBiddinger v.

Nor\n\nwould it have made sense for him to do so, since the defense\n\ndepended on what the government proved or failed to prove at trial.\n\nIn a criminal case a defendant need only plead as to the accusation\n\nof guilt in the indictment and need not raise the statute of\n\nlimitations as an affirmative defense before trial.8       Thurston\n\nmistakes these truisms for an argument that he need not raise the\n\nlimitations defense at all before the jury delivers a verdict of\n\nguilt.\n\n            The government says Thurston has waived9 the issue and\n\nmay not raise it at all.

The     government's      evidence\n\nestablished overt acts by the conspirators within the limitations\n\n\n\n     10\n        Our reasoning that the argument has been forfeited would be\ndifferent if compliance with the limitations period were either\njurisdictional or an element of the offense which the government\nhad the burden of proving. Here, when the limitations defense is\nnot an issue of law but is based on facts to be proven, the defense\nmust be raised at trial at the latest.\n\n                                            -24-\n\fperiod,   so   there   was   no    error   at    all    as   to   the   statute   of\n\nlimitations, much less plain error.\n\n           The government showed that labs overseen by Thurston (and\n\nhis co-conspirators) submitted tens of thousands of reimbursement\n\nclaims to Medicare after December 11, 1992 for ferritin tests\n\nconducted as part of LabScan orders. The government also presented\n\nample evidence that many of these tests were medically unnecessary\n\nand were submitted by doctors unaware that Medicare would be\n\ncharged separately for ferritin.11              It was not credible that the\n\nferritin test, ordered less than two percent of the time, suddenly\n\nbecame medically necessary thirty to forty percent of the time\n\nwithin the life span of the conspiracy.\n\n           Thurston     also      argues   he     was    entitled       to   a   jury\n\ninstruction on the limitations point.

Purported Lack of Criminal Intent and the Requested Reasonable\n     Interpretation Regulation\n\n           Procedurally, the issue of reasonable interpretation\n\ncomes up in two ways: denial of Thurston's Rule 29 motions and\n\ndenial of his request for a jury instruction.          Thurston's three\n\nRule 29 motions -- at the end of the government's case, at the end\n\nof the defense case, and after the verdict -- all argued that he\n\nlacked the needed criminal intent.

Specifically, Thurston contended\n\nthat in the relevant time period an independent clinical lab did\n\nnot violate any aspect of Medicare law by: (1) providing physicians\n\nwith a panel containing a ferritin test, so long as the physician\n\nwas given reliable and accurate information about the test and\n\n\n      12\n           The instruction he requested stated in part:\n\n           Mr. Thurston contends that an independent clinical\n      laboratory does not violate any aspect of Medicare law in\n      providing physicians with a profile or panel that contains a\n      serum ferritin test, so long as the physician is given\n      reliable and accurate information about the test and the\n      choice to select the profile or panel with or without the\n      added test.\n\n           Mr. Thurston also contends that an independent clinical\n      laboratory does not violate any aspect of Medicare law in\n      submitting a claim for reimbursement, using a HCFA form or\n      otherwise, so long as the blood tests performed were ordered\n      by a physician.\n\n           I instruct you as a matter of              law that    these are\n      reasonable   interpretations of the              Medicare    statutes,\n      regulations and rules.\n\n           In order for you to find Mr. Thurston guilty on the basis\n      that he caused physicians to order medically unnecessary tests\n      for their patients, the government must prove beyond a\n      reasonable doubt that these were not Mr. Thurston's\n      interpretations of the pertinent Medicare laws.\n\n                                     -27-\n\fcould select the panel without the test; or (2) submitting a\n\nreimbursement claim, using a HCFA form or otherwise, so long as a\n\nphysician ordered the test performed.          This is one of his primary\n\narguments on appeal.\n\n          Whether a particular defense doctrine is germane depends\n\non the crime charged and the facts of the case.            This is where\n\nThurston's argument falters.       He argues that he could not have had\n\nthe needed intent because employees of clinical labs, including\n\nThurston, \"were unaware that they were actually certifying the\n\nmedical necessity of each test performed for every patient\" and\n\nthey could reasonably interpret the law to mean that the treating\n\nphysician,   not   the    laboratory,   made   the   certification.   The\n\nargument is beside the point.13\n\n          Thurston was not charged with making a false statement to\n\nthe United States, the falsity of which turned on an ambiguity in\n\nwhat the law required.       Nor was he charged with failing to make a\n\nstatement required by law in a situation of parallel ambiguity. He\n\nwas not charged with falsely certifying the medical necessity of\n\nthe tests ordered.       He was charged with the crime of conspiracy to\n\ndefraud the United States by inducing physicians through deceit and\n\ntrickery into certifying tests as medically necessary when the\n\n\n\n     13\n        Thurston argues it would be nonsensical to ask clinical\ntesting laboratories to guarantee that a test ordered by a doctor\nwas in fact medically necessary.    That question simply is not\nraised here.\n\n                                   -28-\n\fferritin tests were not necessary, thus leading Medicare to pay for\n\nunnecessary services.\n\n            Thurston's knowledge of the Medicare regulations and of\n\nthe fact that the ordering physicians would certify the medical\n\nnecessity of the tests was, ironically, part of the proof of the\n\ncrime, not a defense.          Thurston cannot, under 18 U.S.C. § 371,\n\nknowingly     conspire    to    mislead     and   manipulate       doctors   into\n\ncertifying    medically    unnecessary      tests    which   led    to   improper\n\npayment of Medicare funds and then defend on the basis that he\n\ncommitted no fraud because the doctors, not he, were the ones who\n\ncertified the tests as necessary.\n\n             Thurston's reliance on United States v. Prigmore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772431\"><a href=\"/opinion/772431/united-states-v-david-w-prigmore-united-states-v-lee-h-leichter/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2001), is misplaced.             Prigmore is part of a line\n\nof cases charging false statements or failure to make required\n\nstatements, holding that intent should be measured against an\n\nobjectively reasonable understanding of the legal requirements to\n\nbe met, and that a statement is not in fact false or fraudulent if\n\nit is based on an objectively reasonable interpretation of that\n\nlegal requirement.       See id. at 17-18.          This court first applied\n\nthis principle in United States v. Rowe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197937\"><a href=\"/opinion/197937/united-states-v-rowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21-23 (1st\n\nCir. 1998), to a statement that was not in fact false under an\n\nobjectively reasonable interpretation of a disclosure requirement.\n\nIn Prigmore, the conspiracy charged was to defraud and impair the\n\nfunctioning of the Food and Drug Administration, in connection with\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fits oversight and regulation of medical devices, through failure to\n\nfile reports which were required under certain conditions.            The\n\nfraud alleged was the failure to submit a pre-market approval\n\ninformation supplement to the FDA, but whether such a supplement\n\nwas required depended on the interpretation of certain regulations.\n\nThe same conditional requirement was true of certain testing\n\nreports. The question was whether defendants could objectively and\n\nreasonably understand one regulatory phrase, \"affecting the safety\n\nor effectiveness of the device,\" as being circumscribed by another\n\nregulatory phrase, \"intended . . . conditions of use.\"            See 243\n\nF.3d at 15.\n\n            No similar question was presented here.             Here, the\n\nunderlying crime was one of manipulating doctors into making false\n\ncertifications    so   Damon   could    receive   unwarranted    Medicare\n\npayments.     There is no material question about ambiguity in the\n\nunderlying legal requirements and no germane question about the\n\nmeaning of the law.    There was also no issue of lack of fair notice\n\nof what the law requires, a concern underlying the Prigmore/Rowe\n\nline of cases.     A reasonable person knows it is wrong to trick\n\nothers into doing something wrong which one does not do directly\n\noneself, especially in order to obtain personal gain. The Prigmore\n\ndoctrine has no application given the crimes charged and the facts\n\ninvolved.     Because the nature of the crime charged made the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\freasonable interpretation doctrine irrelevant, the jury instruction\n\nissue disappears.\n\nC.   Failure of District Court to Respond To All of Thurston's\n     Requested Instructions\n\n           Thurston argues that the district court violated Rule 30,\n\nFed. R. Crim. P., which provides that\n\n           (a)      In General.   Any party may request in writing\n                    that the court instruct the jury on the law as\n                    specified in the request.   The request must be\n                    made at the close of the evidence or at any\n                    earlier time that the court reasonably sets.\n                    When the request is made, the requesting party\n                    must furnish a copy to every other party.\n\n           (b)      Ruling on a Request. The court must inform the\n                    parties before closing arguments how it intends\n                    to rule on the requested instructions.\n\nThurston is correct: the district court failed to inform the\n\nparties of how it intended to rule on each of the requested\n\ninstructions before closing arguments, as required by the rule.\n\n           A description of the interactions of court and counsel\n\nsets the   stage.     Each   side   submitted   extensive   requests   for\n\ninstructions, and there were disagreements.14 The court did resolve\n\n\n     14\n       As examples of disagreements, Thurston gives the following.\nThe   government   filed   objections   to   Thurston's   requested\ninstructions concerning character evidence and reputation (No. 7);\nThurston's status as vice-president (No. 10); the definition of\n\"knowingly\" (No. 16); the definition of \"willfully\" (No. 17); proof\nof specific intent to participate (No. 18); the definition of\n\"overt act\" (No. 21); the good-faith defense (No. 22); and\nThurston's reasonable interpretation of Medicare laws (No. 23).\nCounsel for Thurston objected to three of the government's\nrequested instructions, each of which concerned an element of the\noffense: conspiracy (No. 18); unlawful objectives (No. 19); and\novert acts (No. 22).\n\n                                    -31-\n\fthe most serious disputes over some of the instructions (for\n\ninstance, on the reasonable interpretation/Prigmore question) and\n\ntold counsel these rulings before closing argument.                 The court did\n\nnot, though, review all of the requests.            Thurston's counsel did\n\nnot object to this silence before giving his closing.\n\n             Defense counsel did raise an issue after closing, and\n\nbefore the jury was instructed, that he wanted to put on record his\n\nspecific objections to the government's requests.               He did not say\n\nhe had been prejudiced in any way by the court's failure to rule on\n\nthe requested instructions before he gave his closing.                  The court\n\nreplied that it would neither rule on nor hear argument on the\n\nproposed instructions.     Rather, the court stated its understanding\n\nthat   the   appropriate   time   to   object     was   at    the    end   of   the\n\ninstructions.       Nonetheless,       it   did   hear       argument      on   the\n\ngovernment's Request No. 8 (the compelled witness rule), and\n\ndeclined to give the instruction.           It also heard argument on the\n\ngovernment's proposed instructions No. 18 (conspiracy); No. 19\n\n(unlawful objectives); and No. 22 (overt act).               The only proposed\n\ndefense instruction called to the court's attention was No. 24, on\n\nmissing witnesses.\n\n             The district court did not, as Rule 30 requires, tell\n\ncounsel before closing argument its disposition of all of the\n\nrequested instructions. But counsel for Thurston had an obligation\n\n\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\fto bring this to the court's attention before the closing and did\n\nnot do so.\n\n              Without addressing the issue of whether Thurston has thus\n\nforfeited the Rule 30 argument, we choose to simply evaluate\n\nwhether defense counsel's closing argument was adversely affected.\n\nSee United States v. Owens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198347\"><a href=\"/opinion/198347/united-states-v-owens/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 753 (1st Cir. 1999).                 It\n\nwas not.      One telling indicium that there was no prejudice is that\n\ntrial counsel did not ever say to the court he would be prejudiced\n\nif he had to proceed with his closing without knowing the court's\n\ndisposition of the remaining requested instructions.\n\n              An even more telling indicium of lack of prejudice is\n\nthat Thurston's appellate counsel has been unable to identify any\n\nspecific areas of prejudice occasioned by the trial court's lapse.\n\nWhile in theory such a lapse could cause prejudice, the most that\n\nis   argued    here   is    that   there   was   \"no    detailed   reference   to\n\nimportant legal concepts regarding criminal conspiracy and the\n\nstate of mind by which Thurston would be judged.\"                        Appellate\n\ncounsel does not identify those \"important legal concepts,\" and we\n\nsee none.       As to Thurston's state of mind, the trial judge did\n\ninstruct on the government's burden to show Thurston had a specific\n\nintent to participate in the conspiracy and to defraud the United\n\nStates.       The   court   instructed     the   jury    to   consider    Thurston\n\nindividually to determine if he willfully joined the conspiracy.\n\nThe court, in turn, defined \"willfully.\" The court also explicitly\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\frejected Thurston's reasonable interpretation instruction, and it\n\ninstructed on good faith.       These circumstances belie any claim of\n\nprejudice and Thurston's claim fails.\n\nD.   Motion for New Trial Based on Dismissal of Apolipoprotein\n     Charge\n\n           Thurston and his co-defendants were originally charged\n\nwith conspiracy to commit fraud as to both the ferritin and the\n\napolipoprotein tests.        At the close of the government's case the\n\ncourt granted Thurston's motion for judgment of acquittal on the\n\napolipoprotein test, struck those references from the indictment,\n\nand instructed the jury that this issue was no longer before it.\n\nThe government did not thereafter refer to this issue.\n\n           Thurston now argues that the court should have granted\n\nThurston   a   new   trial    after    the   jury   returned   because   the\n\napolipoprotein evidence irretrievably tainted the trial.                 The\n\ngovernment rejoins that counsel should have raised the issue\n\nsooner.\n\n           Again, we bypass the issue of forfeiture and reject the\n\nargument that dismissal of the apolipoprotein charges tainted the\n\nproceedings.   Thurston's argument that none of this evidence would\n\nhave been admitted if the ferritin charges were tried alone is\n\nbased on an unlikely premise.         Where the evidence admitted as to a\n\ndismissed count would have been admissible as to a remaining count,\n\nthe defendant has not suffered prejudice. United States v.

The apolipoprotein evidence\n\ncontradicted Thurston's claims about the extent and consequences of\n\nDamon's    decentralized     approach   to    the   make-up,   pricing,    and\n\nmarketing of its panels.\n\n            There was little risk of prejudice for other reasons.\n\nThe government did not mention the apolipoprotein evidence in its\n\nclosing,    and   exhibits    pertaining     only   to   apolipoprotein   were\n\nremoved before the documents were submitted to the jury.            Further,\n\nmost of the testimony and documentary evidence in the first half of\n\nthe case, before the court ruled on the Rule 29 motion, dealt with\n\nferritin.    These factors further minimized the likelihood of any\n\ntaint.\n\n            Thurston's conviction is affirmed.\n\n                        IV.    Sentencing Appeals\n\nA.   Thurston's Appeal from Loss Calculation\n\n            Much of Thurston's guidelines sentence range (sixty-three\n\nto seventy-eight months) was driven by the loss calculation.              Both\n\nthe PSR and the government recommended an intended loss figure of\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\fmore than five million dollars but less than ten million dollars.\n\nThis resulted in a fourteen-level increase in the base offense\n\nlevel.\n\n               Thurston,   not      surprisingly,      targets       this   loss\n\ncalculation.        He makes two arguments.           The first is that the\n\ngovernment was precluded by a comment to U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1 from ever\n\nrelying on intended loss unless the government first established\n\nwhat the actual loss was and then established that the intended\n\nloss     was    greater.     This     is   a   pure    issue    of    guidelines\n\ninterpretation, which we review de novo.               See United States v.\n\nGonzalez-Alvarez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199782\"><a href=\"/opinion/199782/united-states-v-gonzalez-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77 (1st Cir. 2002).                   The second\n\nargument is that the court's conclusion had insufficient factual\n\nsupport for a number of reasons, a contention reviewed for clear\n\nerror.\n\n               The guidelines interpretation argument turns on a comment\n\nwhich provides:\n\n               Consistent with the provisions of § 2X1.1 (Attempt,\n               Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the\n               defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined,\n               this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual\n               loss.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2F1.1, cmt. n.7 (Fraud and Deceit).\n\n               Thurston argues that because the government did not show\n\nactual loss, it cannot turn to intended loss.                  The argument is\n\nsimply wrong as a matter of the wording of the comment.                      The\n\ncomment directs the use of an intended loss figure when it is\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\fgreater than the actual loss figure; the comment does not restrict\n\nthe sentencing court's ability to rely on intended loss when there\n\nis no actual loss calculation available.        Defendant's reading also\n\nmakes little sense: it may be easier as a matter of proof to show\n\nintended loss than actual loss.       Conspirators are held accountable\n\nfor the loss they intend to commit.         Finally, it is obvious on\n\nthese facts that the intended loss was greater than the actual loss\n\n-- some doctors quit using Damon when, to their disgust, they\n\nrealized what the scheme was.\n\n          Thurston next mounts a series of fact-based attacks on\n\nthe intended loss figure of more than five million dollars.          That\n\nfigure is supported by the capital expenditure requests each of the\n\nlabs prepared to obtain funding to buy the equipment needed to\n\nperform the increased ferritin testing the labs anticipated.         Each\n\nCER included a financial analysis, one component of which was the\n\nestimated new revenue from bundling the tests.          Thus, the intended\n\nloss calculation was based on the conspirators' own financial\n\ncalculations.\n\n          Thurston   argues     the     CERs,   being     mere   financial\n\nprojections, are not an adequate basis for an intended loss figure;\n\nthat the CERs were based on an assumed best case scenario in which\n\nno physician who ordered Labscans would decline to get ferritin\n\ntests; that, in any event, not all physicians who ordered the\n\nbundled test were tricked into doing so; that the conspiracy was\n\n\n                                 -37-\n\fnot proven to last five years; that the conspiracy ended before\n\nfive years had elapsed for several labs, given the different dates\n\non which the labs bundled the tests; and that later, only one lab\n\nreported to Thurston.\n\n          A number of these are quickly dispatched.              The jury\n\nverdict of guilt disposes of the question of the length of the\n\nconspiracy. Thurston's promotion out of management of three of the\n\nlabs is irrelevant since he earlier conspired to produce losses\n\nintended to go on for years.\n\n          Thurston also argues the intended loss had to be reduced\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 2X1.1(b)(2) because the government's proof did not\n\nestablish that the conspirators had \"completed all the acts the\n\nconspirators believed necessary on their part for the successful\n\ncompletion of the substantive offense.\"     Id.   There is no merit to\n\nthe argument. There was successful completion of the offense: the\n\ntests   were   bundled   and   doctors   were   misled    into   ordering\n\nunnecessary ferritin tests.     The complaints from customers about\n\nDamon's practices were confirmation the scheme had worked.\n\n          The closer question is the degree of precision the\n\ngovernment must reach in showing intended loss.          It is true that\n\nthe CERs set forth best case scenarios which assumed all doctors\n\nwould order the bundled test without culling out the ferritin test.\n\nIf the CERs stood alone, defendant would have a better argument.\n\nBut they are supplemented by the fact that Damon made it extremely\n\n\n                                 -38-\n\fdifficult for doctors to cull out the ferritin and order the\n\nLabscan without a ferritin test.\n\n            Further, the conspirators tried to hide from doctors the\n\nfact that there was a significant cost to Medicare associated with\n\nthe bundling.    The conspirators were maximizing the probability\n\nthat all doctors would accept the bundling, without culling and\n\nwithout protest.   The fact that the conspirators were not entirely\n\nsuccessful in fooling all doctors does not lessen their intent.\n\n            We have noted before that intended loss does not have to\n\nbe determined with precision; the court needs only to make a\n\nreasonable estimate in light of the available information.

There was good\n\nevidence of intent and some \"prospect of success\" for the fraud to\n\nreap over five million dollars, and that is all that the case law\n\nrequires.   United States v.

The best case CER projection was a loss to Medicare\n\nover the charged five-year life of the conspiracy of $5,800,230.\n\nIt was reasonable for the district court to estimate that the\n\nintended loss exceeded five million dollars, even allowing for the\n\none to two percent normal order rate for ferritin tests.        The\n\ngovernment met its burden and Thurston offered little in rebuttal\n\nexcept his protestations of innocence.    There was no clear error.\n\n\n\n\n                                -39-\n\fB.   Government's Sentencing Appeal\n\n             Given   an   intended   loss   of   five   million   dollars,\n\nThurston's crime led to the statutory maximum sentence of five\n\nyears.      The district court departed downward from the Guidelines\n\nrange by sixteen levels, however, sentencing Thurston to three\n\nmonths' imprisonment to be followed by twenty-four months of\n\nsupervised release. The court imposed no fine and recommended that\n\nthe term of imprisonment be served in a halfway house.\n\n1.   Appeal from Grant of Downward Departures\n\n             The government argues that each of the stated grounds for\n\ndownward departure was in error.15          First, it contends that the\n\n\n      15\n           The court stated:\n\n           [I]n granting the motion for downward departure, I'm\n      basing it on two grounds.\n\n           First, the downward departure is justified because of the\n      defendant Thurston's record of charitable work and community\n      service[, which] is unique, extensive and extraordinary. I\n      think the record should reflect that in over fourteen years of\n      sentencing defendants, it's my judgment that no one had a more\n      extraordinary devotion to charitable work, community service,\n      and especially his dedication to his church.\n\n           And the second ground is that which is set out in the\n      United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual under\n      Chapter 1, Part A, Section 3, which is entitled . . . \"The\n      Basic Approach, paren, policy statement, closed paren,\"\n      setting forth the rationale of the guidelines, it's cited here\n      that Congress sought reasonable uniformity in sentencing by\n      narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar\n      criminal offenses committed by similar offenders.\n\n           Congress sought proportionality in sentencing through a\n      system that imposes appropriately different sentences for\n      criminal conduct of differing severity.\n\n                                     -40-\n\fdistrict     court   was   forbidden          to   depart    downward        based    on   a\n\ndisparity between Thurston's sentence and the sentence of the\n\ncompany president, a cooperating co-conspirator who pled guilty.\n\nNext, it argues that departure for good deeds is discouraged and\n\nthat   the   facts     provide      no    basis    to   warrant        a    finding   that\n\nThurston's    good     deeds   are       so   exceptional         as   to   make   such    a\n\ndeparture appropriate.\n\na.

We\npoint this out because Thurston's fraudulent conduct took place\nbefore Koon and when this court used a de novo standard of review,\nas is now mandated by the PROTECT Act.\n\n                                    -43-\n\fthe heartland), thus warranting consideration of a departure.\n\nCongress requires the courts of appeals to consider whether a\n\nsentence that departs from the applicable guideline range is based\n\non a factor that:\n\n            (i)     does not advance the objectives set forth in\n                    section 3553(a)(2); or\n            (ii)    is not authorized under section 3553(b); or\n            (iii)   is not justified by the facts of the case[.]\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3742(e)(3)(B).\n\n            Thurston argues that the PROTECT Act should not be\n\ninterpreted to apply to this case and that, if it did apply, it\n\nwould be retroactive and invalid.          He makes two statutory intent\n\narguments: (1) that the internal structure of the statute means it\n\nshould not be applied to cases already pending on appeal; and (2)\n\nthat the presumption against retroactivity should apply.\n\n            First, Thurston argues that Congress meant application of\n\nthe de novo review provisions in the PROTECT Act to be deferred\n\nuntil appeals arise from sentences entered after the Act became\n\neffective.    This is evident, Thurston says, since the Act imposed\n\na   new   requirement   for   the   district   judge   to   give   a   written\n\nstatement of reasons.     From this, Thurston argues, all provisions\n\nof the Act were meant to apply only to post-Act sentencing.               The\n\nargument is plausible, but we are unpersuaded.              Even before the\n\nPROTECT Act, a trial court was required to give some reasons,\n\nthough not necessarily in writing, for a downward departure.              See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(c) (2000) (pre-PROTECT Act version); United States\n\n                                    -44-\n\fv.

See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 264.   Not so.   The change\n\nof a standard of appellate review is one in procedure for the\n\ncourts; procedural changes that do not affect substantial rights\n\nare not usually considered retroactive. This legislation is little\n\ndifferent than the Supreme Court's changing the standard of review\n\nby directing the courts of appeals to decide ultimate Fourth\n\nAmendment questions by de novo review.

That is why, since as early\n\nas    1991,   this    court    has   interpreted    the   statute     to   preclude\n\nsentencing judges from departing downward based on \"a perceived\n\nneed to equalize sentencing outcomes for similarly situated co-\n\ndefendants, without more.\"             Wogan, 938 F.2d at 1448 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n              The \"more\" that is needed refers to circumstances not\n\nadequately considered by the Commission, and none have been shown\n\nhere with regard to disparity.             In the pre-Guidelines era, the\n\ndistrict court's attempt to avoid perceived unfairness would have\n\nhad greater weight.            The Guidelines bind us and they bind the\n\ndistrict court.         The downward departure based on disparity in\n\nsentences among co-defendants was impermissible.\n\n              ii.    Good Works\n\n              The second ground, based on Thurston's good works, poses\n\nthe most difficult issue in the case.                We have found disparity\n\nalone an impermissible ground; it is possible the trial court would\n\nnot have granted so extensive a departure based on good works\n\nalone.    It may also be that if the court had granted a modest\n\n\n                                        -49-\n\fdeparture on the second ground, the government would not have\n\nappealed.     But the trial court did not differentiate and the\n\ngovernment on appeal argues that any departure at all based on good\n\nworks (like the departure for disparity) was contrary to law.\n\n            The Sentencing Guidelines discourage downward departures\n\nfrom the normal sentencing range based on good works -- that is,\n\ncivic, charitable, or public service.     U.S.S.G. § 5H1.11.     Such\n\ndepartures are permitted only when the good works are exceptional.18\n\nSee United States v. Pereira, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199710\"><a href=\"/opinion/199710/united-states-v-pereira/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80 (1st Cir. 2001).   The\n\ndistrict court based its finding that Thurston's good works were\n\nexceptional on Thurston's \"record of charitable work and community\n\nservice[, which is] unique, extensive and extraordinary.\"         The\n\ncourt continued, \"I think the record should reflect that in over\n\nfourteen years of sentencing defendants, it's my judgment that no\n\none had a more extraordinary devotion to charitable work, community\n\nservice, and especially . . . to his church.\"   Thurston is a member\n\nof the Church of Latter Day Saints, tithes ten percent of his\n\nincome (as his church encourages him to do), and devotes hours\n\nevery week to unpaid service with the church in a variety of\n\npositions. Letters from his fellow congregants characterize him as\n\n\n\n\n     18\n        Good works may also be considered in setting a sentence\nwithin the Guidelines range or in setting certain conditions. This\ndoes Thurston no good, however, since the applicable Guidelines\nrange is sixty-three to seventy-eight months, all above the\nstatutory maximum of sixty months.\n\n                                -50-\n\fa man of principle and impeccable character19 -– characterizations\n\nundermined, of course, by the jury's finding of guilt.                   In any\n\nevent, it     is    good   works,   objectively   measured,     and    not   good\n\ncharacter that is at issue.\n\n            In addition, Thurston has taken family members and others\n\ninto his home and has been helpful to his neighbors.             For example,\n\nthe parents of a woman undergoing rehabilitation at a local medical\n\ncenter stayed at Thurston's home for several weeks.                   On another\n\noccasion, Thurston and his family laid sod for an infirm neighbor.\n\nSave for his crime, Thurston appears to have lived a creditworthy\n\nlife.\n\n            The issue then becomes, as we engage in de novo review,\n\nthe point of reference by which to determine whether Thurston's\n\ngood works provide a basis for a departure.             Earlier, under Koon,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the very sensible rationale was that the district\n\ncourts, which saw far more sentencing cases than the courts of\n\nappeals, were better positioned to determine what was exceptional,\n\nand     appellate    courts    owed   deference    to    that    more     expert\n\ndetermination.       See id. at 96-100.      The PROTECT Act has abrogated\n\n\n\n      19\n        During the trial, numerous witnesses for both sides\ntestified to Thurston's reputation for honesty and integrity.\nDuring the sentencing phase, many of Thurston's friends and family\nmembers explicitly or implicitly said they thought the jury verdict\nwas incorrect.\n     Good character is covered by the aberrant behavior guidelines,\nand here is no claim on appeal that Thurston was entitled to a\ndeparture on those grounds.\n\n                                      -51-\n\fthat deference.          There are many policy arguments in favor of\n\ndeference to the district court, which were presented to Congress\n\nby the Judicial Conference of the United States.                      But Congress\n\nchose to decide the balance differently, expressing concern that\n\nthe departure rate for certain crimes and within certain districts\n\nthreatened to undermine the Guidelines regime.                     See, e.g., H.R.\n\nRep.         No.       108-66,          at      58-59,           available        at\n\nhttp://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/T?&report=hr066&dbname=cp10\n\n8&;    149   Cong.

Sensenbrenner).\n\n             In      reviewing     de    novo    whether     any    departure      is\n\npermissible, the PROTECT Act and the case law require courts of\n\nappeals to consider three sources: other decisions under the\n\nGuidelines; the Commission's relevant Guidelines and statements;\n\nand the congressional purposes behind sentencing.                  Even before the\n\nPROTECT Act, the question of whether a discouraged factor was\n\npresent in an exceptional way was determined in large part by\n\ncomparison with other Guidelines cases.                 See Pereira, 272 F.3d at\n\n80 (citing Koon, 518 U.S. at 98).             Such other cases are not limited\n\nto cases involving convictions for the same offense.

These cases are less\n\npersuasive than those cited by the government, since the circuit\n\ncourts merely hold that there was no abuse of discretion and since\n\nthe facts are less analogous.

We would\n\nfind the expertise reflected in the decisions of the district\n\ncourts to be useful as well in determining whether particular good\n\nworks are exceptional.       But the parties have not cited any such\n\ncases.\n\n              As the government's cases indicate, corporate executives\n\nare usually better situated to make large financial contributions\n\nand are often expected, by virtue of their positions, to engage in\n\n\n                                      -54-\n\fcivic and    charitable       activities.

And those\n\nwhose place in life does not give them similar opportunities should\n\nnot be disadvantaged.         See U.S.S.G. § 5H1.10.\n\n            For similar reasons, we would be reluctant to find a\n\ndefendant's good works exceptional solely on the basis of actions\n\nthat were required or encouraged as a condition of membership in a\n\nreligious institution.          Such a result -- which would seemingly\n\nentitle all members in good standing to a downward departure --\n\ncould undercut the principle that religion (like socio-economic\n\nstatus) is a forbidden basis for departure. See U.S.S.G. § 5H1.10.\n\nOn the other hand, good works should not have less weight because\n\na defendant was motivated by religious belief. Thurston should not\n\nbe disadvantaged by his church involvement.               It would, in any\n\nevent, do a disservice to Thurston to categorize him entirely in\n\nterms of his economic or religious status. His good works predated\n\nhis executive status and continued over time; they exceeded the\n\nbare requirements for church membership; and they involved costs to\n\nhim in terms of time and effort.\n\n            In   sum,   the    comparison   to    other   case    law   is   not\n\ndispositive and is, in any event, only one part of the analysis.\n\nWe move on to the Guidelines and to the purposes of sentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -55-\n\f             Two salient principles emerge from the Guidelines: the\n\ngoal of parity between white collar and other criminal defendants\n\nand the goal of discouraging departures based on good works.\n\nCongress and the Sentencing Commission were clear that under the\n\npre-Guidelines regime, sentences for white collar crimes were too\n\nlenient.20      The    Sentencing   Commission     intended       to   \"equalize\n\npunishments for 'white collar' and 'blue collar' crime.\"                  United\n\nStates v.

Thurston's admirable good works simply are not so\n\nexceptional, in context, as to provide a basis to depart.\n\n              The    government's    argument     that   Thurston's       conduct\n\nwarranted an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice based on\n\nperjury at trial need not be resolved, given our disposition of the\n\nother issues.         The statute caps his period of incarceration at\n\nsixty months.        It is noteworthy, though, that Thurston's testimony\n\non key matters of fact was contradicted by multiple witnesses.\n\nc.   Fine\n\n              The government argues that the sentencing judge erred by\n\nfailing to impose a fine on Thurston in accordance with the\n\nGuidelines. Thurston argued, and the district court accepted, that\n\nhe   should    not    receive   a   fine   because   that     would    create   an\n\nunacceptable        disparity   between    his   sentence    and   that   of    co-\n\ndefendant Isola.        Sentence disparity is an unacceptable basis for\n\nrefusing to impose a fine and is plain error for the reasons\n\ndiscussed earlier.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -58-\n\f           Thurston contends that the government has forfeited its\n\nargument that a fine must be imposed by failing to object after the\n\njudge ruled.       The government earlier took the position that a fine\n\nmust be imposed and also argued that the court could not refuse to\n\nimpose a fine on the basis of disparity -- the only argument\n\nThurston presented.           In these circumstances, the issue was not\n\nforfeited.     See Gallant, 306 F.3d at 1187-88 (holding that a\n\nsentencing issue was not forfeited as a result of counsel's failure\n\nto object after the court's ruling); cf. United States v. Meserve,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199680\"><a href=\"/opinion/199680/united-states-v-meserve/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 325 (1st Cir. 2001) (motion to strike unnecessary to\n\npreserve evidentiary issue where party objected prior to trial\n\ncourt's ruling).          Even were this an instance of forfeiture, the\n\ndistrict court committed plain error in its rationale.\n\n             Before    this    court,   Thurston     attempts     to    defend       the\n\ndecision not to impose a fine on the basis that the statutory\n\ndefinition    of    his    crime,   which      provides   that   a     fine    may   be\n\nassigned, trumps the Guidelines, which provide that a fine must be\n\nassigned   barring        special   circumstances.        The    crime    of    which\n\nThurston was convicted, 18 U.S.C. § 371, provides for a prison\n\nterm, a fine, or both.        By contrast, U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(a) says, \"The\n\ncourt shall impose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant\n\nestablishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become\n\nable to pay any fine.\"          (emphasis added).         The defendant did not\n\nestablish, or even seek to establish, inability to pay.                              The\n\n\n                                        -59-\n\fsentencing judge made no finding, implicit or explicit, that\n\nThurston could not pay.      The PSR estimated that Thurston had a net\n\nworth   of   over   $1.5   million,   and    the   minimum     fine   under   the\n\nGuidelines was $12,500.\n\n             Because the sentence fixed by U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(a) is\n\nwithin the range contemplated by 18 U.S.C. § 371, the Guideline is\n\nnot trumped by the statute.        See United States v. Page, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196778\"><a href=\"/opinion/196778/united-states-v-page/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n43 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"There is no reason why the Guidelines may not\n\nmake their own classifications within the statutes, and hence\n\ndefinitions which the courts must observe, so long as these are not\n\ninternally inconsistent or in violation of the Constitution or a\n\nfederal   statute.\").       Here   there     is   no   inconsistency    and   the\n\ndistrict court was required to impose a fine.\n\n                              V.    Conclusion\n\n             Thurston's conviction is affirmed.           Thurston's sentence\n\nis   vacated;   the   downward     departure      based   on   good   works   and\n\npurported disparity is reversed; and the order that no fine be\n\nimposed is reversed.       The case is remanded for imposition of the\n\nstatutory maximum sentence of sixty months in prison and for\n\nimposition of an appropriate fine.           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -60-\n\f</pre>",
