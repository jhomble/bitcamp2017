  "plain_text": "          United States Court of Appeals\n                     For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 09-1815\n\n\n                         UNITED STATES,\n\n                            Appellee,\n\n                               v.\n\n                      JESUS FRANQUIZ-ORTIZ,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [[Hon. José Antonio Fusté,    U.S. District Judge]]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                   Lipez, Howard and Thompson,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Laura Maldonado Rodríguez on brief for appellant.\n     Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney,     and\nNelson Pérez-Sosa, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 9, 2010\n\f           Per Curiam.        This is an appeal from a sentence imposed\n\nupon revocation of supervised release.\n\n           Jesus Franquiz-Ortiz (Franquiz) was convicted in 2003 on\n\na plea of guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute\n\nheroin, a Class C felony.          He was sentenced to serve 46 months of\n\nimprisonment and three years of supervised release.                   The parties\n\nagree, in their briefs, on the events that led to revocation of the\n\nterm of supervised release and the imposition of a sentence of\n\nimprisonment.\n\n           After about two years of the term of supervised release\n\nhad   elapsed,   during      an   unannounced   visit   in    April    2009,    the\n\nprobation officer found a package containing one pound of marijuana\n\nin Franquiz's car.        The probation officer filed a motion for an\n\norder to show cause in regard to revocation.\n\n           Franquiz did not challenge the allegation that he had\n\ncommitted a Grade B violation of a condition of his supervised\n\nrelease and waived his right to a preliminary hearing.                       At the\n\nfinal   hearing,   the    parties      presented   to   the    court     a    joint\n\nrecommendation     of   12    months   of    imprisonment     without     further\n\nsupervised release. Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines,\n\n§ 7B1.4(a), the recommendation represented an upward departure from\n\nthe advisory guideline range of 4-10 months for a Grade B violation\n\nand a criminal history category (CHC) I. The government offered no\n\nargument in regard to the joint recommendation. Defense counsel\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fargued, in support of the recommendation that, while on supervised\n\nrelease, Franquiz had been steadily employed for two years, had\n\nnever tested positive to drugs, had paid his alimony, and had filed\n\nhis income tax returns; in addition, this was his first time before\n\nthe court in relation to supervised release.\n\n          The district court rejected the joint recommendation and\n\nimposed a sentence of 24 months of imprisonment, the statutory\n\nmaximum permissible sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3) and well\n\nabove both the applicable advisory guideline range of four to ten\n\nmonths and the parties' joint recommendation of twelve months. The\n\ncourt offered the following explanation:\n\n          I am not prepared to give him ... a guideline\n          range sentence.... This individual has been\n          given opportunities. What he has done is not\n          de minimis by any means, and I do think that\n          if I am not going to supervise him anymore, I\n          am going to make him serve 24 months with no\n          additional supervision.\n\n(Emphasis added).   As the sentence proposed by the parties was, in\n\nfact, itself above the advisory guideline range, this comment does\n\nnot reveal the court's rationale for imposing a non-guideline\n\nsentence twice as long.\n\n          We review sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised\n\nrelease under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. United\n\nStates v. McInnis, 429 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).   In order to do\n\nso, we need a record that provides a basis for evaluating the\n\ndistrict court's exercise of its broad authority.\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f           Here, the court's explicit statement is, by itself,\n\ninsufficient.      Unfortunately, the court's rationale cannot be\n\ninferred from the record on appeal. In the instant case - as in\n\nmany revocation cases - the record is thin.             It reflects no input\n\nfrom the probation officer.         No information is contained in the\n\ntranscript of the preliminary hearing waiver proceedings beyond\n\nthat   necessary   to   establish    that    the   waiver   was    knowing   and\n\nvoluntary. Neither party submitted a sentencing memorandum or any\n\nother document to the district court.          At the revocation hearing,\n\nafter suggesting a sentence of 12 months, the AUSA made no other\n\nstatement. Nothing in the record refers to any sentencing factor\n\nset out in 18 U.S.C. § 3583.        Therefore, we cannot know what facts\n\nand arguments the district court considered. Compare United States\n\nv. Zapata, 589 F.3d 475 (1st Cir. 2009)(record reflected court's\n\nconsideration of identifiable facts and arguments).\n\n           The lack of an explicit or implicit explanation is of\n\nparticular concern when the substantive reasonableness of the\n\nsentence is not immediately apparent.          First, it is not clear why\n\nthe court regarded the above-guideline joint recommendation of the\n\nparties as insufficient punishment for the breach of trust that the\n\nviolation represented.      Second, by imposing the statutory maximum\n\nsentence, the court left no room for harsher sentences for those\n\nwith   higher    criminal   history        categories    and      more   serious\n\nviolations.     As we noted in United States v. Gallo, 20 F.3d 7, 14\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f(1st Cir. 1994); accord United States v. Torres-Marin, 06-1333 (1st\n\nCir. May 15, 2007)(unpub), the court's calibration of the relevant\n\nfactors is an element of the exercise of discretion.\n\n          As the record provides an insufficient basis for review\n\nof the procedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentence,\n\nthe revocation sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for\n\nresentencing in conformity with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
