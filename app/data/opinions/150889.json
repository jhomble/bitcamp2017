This is an appeal from the\n\nconvictions of Defendants-Appellants Félix Alberto Castro-Davis\n\n(\"Alberto\")    and   Félix      Gabriel      Castro-Davis     (\"Gabriel\")\n\n(collectively \"defendants\").1         Alberto and Gabriel were found\n\nguilty of conspiracy to commit carjacking, in violation of             18\n\nU.S.C. § 371, aiding and abetting a carjacking resulting in death,\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2119(3) and 2, and using or carrying\n\na firearm in connection with a carjacking, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 2.         They appeal their convictions\n\nbased on the sufficiency of the evidence, the introduction of\n\ndefendants'   statements   against     co-defendants,   the   making   of\n\nprejudicial   statements   by   the    prosecution,   and   flawed   jury\n\nselection and sentencing procedures.\n\n          After careful consideration, we affirm the convictions of\n\nboth defendants, but vacate their sentences and remand to the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  These two cases were consolidated with United States v. Figueroa\nCartagena, No. 08-2110, and argued before this court on November 2,\n2009.   Although the issues presented in all three appeals are\nsubstantially similar, we opt to decide the cases separately. See,\ne.g., United States v. Caraballo, 552 F.3d 6, 7 n.1 (1st Cir.\n2008).\n\n                                  -3-\n\f                              I. Background\n\n            A.   Factual Background2\n\n            On the morning of July 15, 2006, Héctor Pérez-Torres\n\n(\"Pérez\") left his home in Caguas, Puerto Rico at 11:00 am to drive\n\nhis bolita route.3     Pérez had been a bolitero for many years, and\n\nwas driving his wife's 1986 Mazda 626 along his usual route, where\n\nhe would stop to collect lottery bets.    He was seen later that day,\n\naround 3:00 or 4:00 p.m., at the Farmacia San Antonio, which was a\n\nregular stop on his route, by pharmacist Brenda García-Medina\n\n(\"García\").      The pharmacy is located in and adjacent to a section\n\nof the town called El Salchichón, and connected to it by means of\n\na secluded road, which is surrounded by dense vegetation.     Later,\n\nPérez's car was seen driving through El Salchichón, although\n\nwitness Jannette Ocasio-Ortiz (\"Ocasio\") testified that the car she\n\nrecognized as belonging to Pérez was not being operated in the\n\nusual way. While Pérez would ordinarily drive very slowly and honk\n\nhis horn to allow those who wished to play the bolita to approach\n\nhim, on July 15, 2006 the car was driving very quickly.       Ocasio\n\nalso testified that, although she could not see who was driving the\n\ncar, she noticed that the silhouette of the driver was too tall to\n\nbe Pérez.\n\n\n2\n   These facts are drawn from the trial transcript, based on the\nfindings of a reasonable jury.\n3\n  The \"bolita\" is an underground lottery.     Pérez was a \"bolitero,\"\nor numbers runner.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f               Later that evening, José Figueroa-Cartagena (\"José\") was\n\nin his home when he received a telephone call from his sister,\n\nNeliza.        Neliza asked José to step outside, because defendant\n\nGabriel wanted to speak with him.            José complied and spoke with\n\nGabriel, who offered José money to watch Pérez's car, with Pérez\n\ninside.    José agreed and allowed Alberto, who was driving Pérez's\n\nMazda,    to    park   the   car   underneath   a   tent   José   used   in   his\n\nautomotive repair business.          Pérez was in the back seat.\n\n               Alberto and Gabriel proceeded to search the car, and José\n\ntestified that he witnessed Alberto remove a revolver from the car\n\nand place it on the roof.            Though defendants did not appear to\n\nremove anything else from the car, José testified that he overheard\n\nthem having a discussion about an ATM card they found on Pérez's\n\nperson.    José also testified that Alberto bragged to him about the\n\nspeed of the car, and told him that they had taken it \"policeman\n\nstyle.\"        When asked what that meant, José explained that he\n\nunderstood this phrase to mean \"that they stopped the car . . .\n\nwith the weapon, and they said, this is the police.\"\n\n               Alberto and Gabriel then left the area to attempt to\n\nwithdraw money using Pérez's ATM card, leaving José to watch over\n\nPérez, who remained in the back of his Mazda.\n\n               Alone with Pérez, José fielded several requests from his\n\ncaptive which included rolling down the windows and getting him a\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fdrink of water.      At this point, José noticed that Pérez was\n\nhandcuffed.\n\n           While guarding Pérez, José placed a call to defendants,\n\nand spoke with Neliza, who assured him that they would return\n\nsoon.4    Shortly   thereafter,     Pérez   attempted   an    escape,   which\n\nresulted in a struggle between him and José.        In the course of the\n\nstruggle, Pérez shouted: \"Help, they want to kill me.\"              As José\n\nfought with Pérez, Alberto, Gabriel, and Neliza arrived.            Alberto\n\nand   Gabriel   helped   subdue    Pérez.     Hearing   the    ruckus,   two\n\nneighbors, Laura Ramos-Ortiz (\"Ramos\") and Celestina Montañez-\n\nBorges, approached to inquire what was happening.            José told them\n\nnot to worry and not to call the police.         Then, Neliza again told\n\nthe two neighbors to leave.       When they attempted to move in closer,\n\nNeliza and Gabriel closed a gate that divided the properties to\n\nprevent the neighbors' access.\n\n           After this incident, which occurred approximately fifteen\n\nto twenty minutes after Pérez was left in José's custody, José\n\ndrove away to a gas station.        There, he washed the mud off of his\n\ncar and drank a beer.    Gabriel and Alberto arrived with Neliza soon\n\nthereafter in two separate vehicles.           Neliza exited her Grand\n\nVitara sport utility vehicle, to check on José.         Alberto, Gabriel,\n\n\n\n4\n   José testified that he intended to speak with Gabriel, but it\nwas Neliza who answered the phone.    It is unclear whether she\nanswered Gabriel's phone, or if José accidentally called his\nsister's phone.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fand Pérez remained in Pérez's Mazda.            José testified that he saw\n\nthat Gabriel had Pérez in a headlock.       After briefly speaking with\n\nJosé, Alberto, Gabriel and Neliza left the gas station in the\n\nmanner they arrived, and drove off in the same direction.\n\n           Later that night, as she was falling asleep, Pérez's\n\nwife, Luz Rosario-García (\"Rosario\"), was startled by the sound of\n\nintruders.       She investigated and found a young man, whom she\n\ndescribed as tall and skinny, in her home.          The man called Rosario\n\nby name and told her to calm herself.           He also stated that if she\n\nshouted, she would get both herself and the man killed.               Rosario\n\nthen encountered a second intruder, whom she described as tough-\n\nlooking, and wearing a mask and gloves. Rosario testified that she\n\nobserved that the second intruder had a firearm, though she did not\n\nknow what kind it was.     The intruders asked for her ATM card, which\n\nshe   procured    for   them.   They     also    asked    for   her   personal\n\nidentification number to activate the card, and when Rosario began\n\nto recite the number, which was the same as her husband's, the\n\nsecond   intruder   indicated   that   he   already      knew   it.   Rosario\n\ntestified that the intruders then asked for access to her husband's\n\nmoneybox, and when she told them that they would have to wait for\n\nPérez to return, they informed her that they had kidnaped him.\n\nAfter the intruders left, Rosario found that they obtained entry to\n\nher home by using her husband's keys, which they abandoned.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           The next day, July 16, 2006, José saw Neliza and Gabriel\n\nagain at his home.      Gabriel stated that they \"had to kill him,\"\n\nreferring to Pérez, because \"it got real difficult for us and he\n\nstruggled a lot.\"      Gabriel explained that, although Alberto had a\n\ngun, they chose to asphyxiate Pérez with duct tape, because they\n\ndid not want to get the gun dirty.          José testified that both Neliza\n\nand   Gabriel   instructed   him    to   speak   with   the    neighbors   that\n\nattempted to intervene on the previous day, and to secure their\n\nsilence, if necessary, with threats.\n\n           B.   The Investigation\n\n           Pérez's body was found on July 17, 2006 in the backseat\n\nof his Mazda in Caguas.             The cause of death was mechanical\n\nasphyxiation    from   the   duct   tape    on   his   face.    State   agents\n\ncontacted José regarding the events outside his home.             Although he\n\ndid not cooperate at first, he later agreed to speak candidly about\n\nthe incident.\n\n           Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\")\n\npresented Rosario with a spread of photographs, the third depicting\n\nGabriel.   She stated that she recognized the man in the third photo\n\nfrom her neighborhood.        She also stated that he resembled the\n\nunmasked intruder in her home, even though he appeared thinner in\n\nperson than in the photograph. Documenting her impressions for the\n\nagents, she wrote and signed a note that stated: \"With reference to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fnumber three, he looks alike, but I cannot identify whether this is\n\nthe young man who entered my home.\"5\n\n          FBI agents arrested Gabriel and interviewed him.    When\n\nasked about his relationship to Neliza, Gabriel stated that she was\n\nhis girlfriend.   Agents questioned Gabriel about the murder of\n\nPérez, but Gabriel denied any knowledge or involvement. When asked\n\nwhy he had been seen fighting with the victim, Gabriel stated that\n\nNeliza's neighbors were trying to frame him. The agent pointed out\n\nto Gabriel that he had not said where the fight took place.\n\nGabriel continued to deny everything.\n\n          On April 25, 2007, during his pre-trial incarceration,\n\nAlberto spoke to his mother, Carmen Davis, over the telephone. The\n\nconversation was recorded. During the course of this conversation,\n\nAlberto told his mother that \"Neliza is the one who is talking,\"\n\nand \"That bitch is going to fuck us over.\"      As to Gabriel, he\n\nstated, presumably in reference to the police: \"They have a picture\n\nof him and everything.   I saw it.\"\n\n\n\n\n5\n    At trial, Rosario again was not able to make a definite\nidentification, but stated that the photo resembled the unmasked\nintruder:\n\n     [Prosecution]: So what you're telling us is the young man who\n     came into your house looked a lot like this young man in this\n     photo . . . but he was skinnier; is that right?\n\n     [Rosario García]: Correcto, because when he turned the lighter\n     [sic.] on, I tried to look at him to see who he was.\n     Correcto.\n\n                                -9-\n\f            C.   Procedural History\n\n            On April 25, 2007, a grand jury in Puerto Rico returned\n\na three-count indictment charging all three defendants with one\n\ncount each of conspiracy to commit carjacking, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 371; carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2119(3) and\n\n2; and the use and carrying of a firearm during a violent crime, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 2.\n\n            The case proceeded to a jury trial on March 5, 2008.\n\nDuring the jury selection process, the district court judge asked\n\ncounsel whether there were any challenges to potential jurors for\n\ncause.    After two for-cause challenges, the judge asked whether\n\ncounsel wished to exercise any peremptory challenges.               But, the\n\njudge    immediately   assigned   two   jurors   to   act    as   alternates,\n\nessentially combining the regular and peremptory challenges. It is\n\nuncontroverted that this violated Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure, which requires separate regular and peremptory\n\nchallenges for ordinary jurors and alternates.              Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n24(c)(4)(A).6\n\n\n\n\n6\n   Neither Alberto nor Gabriel appeal on this issue, but we note\nthat this issue has been before us on other occasions. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. González-Meléndez, 594 F.3d 28, 33-34 (1st Cir.\n2010).   While the Supreme Court \"has indicated that mistaken\ndenials of peremptory challenges do not ordinarily warrant\nautomatic reversal,\" id. (quoting Rivera v. Illinois, 129 S. Ct.\n1446, 1455 (2009)), district court judges should refrain from\ncommitting this error in the future.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f          At trial, a recording of Alberto's telephone conversation\n\nwith his mother was introduced over defendants' objections, as was\n\nGabriel's statement to agents which referred to Neliza.         The\n\njudge's instructions to the jury did not limit either the relevance\n\nof Alberto's recorded conversation or Gabriel's statements to\n\nfederal agents.\n\n          The jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts against\n\nGabriel and Alberto.   They were sentenced to 60 months under the\n\nconspiracy count to be served concurrently with life imprisonment\n\nas to the carjacking count, and an 84 month consecutive term for\n\nthe firearms count.    Gabriel and Alberto timely appealed their\n\nconvictions on grounds of insufficiency of the evidence, certain\n\nevidentiary rulings made by the district judge, a violation of\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 24(c)(4)(A), and statements made by the prosecutor\n\nduring closing argument.7\n\n                            II. Discussion\n\n          A.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n          Alberto and Gabriel deny that the government presented\n\nsufficient evidence against them to find each element of the\n\noffenses beyond a reasonable doubt.          We thus review de novo\n\n\"whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\n\n\n7\n   While only Alberto initially appealed his sentence based on the\ndistrict court's misapplication of the sentencing guidelines, we\nallowed Gabriel to adopt the argument, as the mistakes were\nconcurrent.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fjury   verdict,   a    reasonable   factfinder   could   have   found   the\n\ndefendant[s] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"          United States v.\n\nRodríguez-Berríos, 573 F.3d 55, 65-66 (1st Cir. 2009).          We do not\n\n\"weigh evidence or make credibility judgments,\" but rather \"must\n\nuphold any verdict that is supported by a plausible rendition of\n\nthe record.\" United States v. Ofray-Campos, 534 F.3d 1, 31-32 (1st\n\nCir. 2008)(citation omitted).\n\n                      1.   Conspiracy\n\n            Alberto and Gabriel were charged under 18 U.S.C. § 371.8\n\nTo support a conviction under a conspiracy charge, the government\n\nmust show that a defendant had both the intent to agree to commit\n\na crime, and the intent that the crime be completed.        United States\n\nv. Escobar de Jesús, 187 F.3d 148, 175 (1st Cir. 1999).                  \"A\n\nsustainable conspiracy conviction requires direct or circumstantial\n\nevidence which establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\ndefendant and one or more coconspirators intended to agree and\n\n. . . to commit the substantive criminal offense which was the\n\n\n8\n    18 U.S.C. § 371 reads:\n\n            If two or more persons conspire either to commit any\n       offense against the United States, or to defraud the\n       United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for\n       any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act\n       to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be\n       fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five\n       years, or both.\n            If, however, the offense, the commission of which is\n       the object of the conspiracy, is a misdemeanor only, the\n       punishment for such conspiracy shall not exceed the\n       maximum punishment provided for such misdemeanor.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fobject of their unlawful agreement.\"         United States v. Tejeda, 974\n\nF.2d 210, 212 (1st Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\"The prosecution need only show knowledge of the basic agreement,\n\nwith an intent to commit the underlying substantive offense.                  The\n\nrequisite knowledge and intent can be proven through circumstantial\n\nevidence, including inferences from acts committed by the defendant\n\nthat furthered the conspiracy's purposes.\"                    United States v.\n\nGarcía-Pastrana, 584 F.3d 351, 377 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal\n\nquotation marks and alterations omitted).              Defendants argue that\n\nthe government presented no evidence of an agreement or specific\n\nplan to carjack the victim, and thus cannot maintain a conspiracy\n\nconviction.      We do not agree.\n\n            The evidence presented at trial shows a well-orchestrated\n\nplot to carjack and kidnap the victim, which bespeaks a prior\n\nagreement.    First, there was testimony that Alberto and Gabriel\n\nlived two houses away from Pérez, a fact that would allow the jury\n\nto reasonably infer that they were aware of Pérez's dealings and\n\nmovements.    There was also testimony that the last place Pérez\n\nstopped his car before the carjacking was a pharmacy on a secluded\n\ncountry   road     with   lots   of   surrounding     cover    and   vegetation.\n\nMoreover,    the   carjacking     occurred   on   a   bolita    day,   when   one\n\nfamiliar with Pérez's dealings could infer that he was likely to\n\nhave significant amounts of cash in the car. Finally, the presence\n\nof the revolver and the handcuffs used to subdue Pérez could also\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\freasonably lead to an inference of defendants' forethought in\n\nexecuting their heist.       See United States v. Pérez-González, 445\n\nF.3d 39, 49 (1st Cir. 2006) (holding that jury could reasonably\n\ninfer existence of conspiracy to break into and vandalize a naval\n\nbase when defendants brought sledgehammers and wire cutters to\n\nnearby celebration and acted in a coordinated fashion). Therefore,\n\nsince   the    carjacking   seems     to    have   been   perpetrated   at   a\n\nspecifically opportune time, in a conveniently secluded place,\n\nusing the tools necessary to pull off the operation, a reasonable\n\njury would have legally sufficient evidence to find that defendants\n\nAlberto and Gabriel planned the crime in advance and possessed the\n\nrequisite intent to support a conviction for conspiracy.\n\n                     2. Carjacking9\n\n              The elements of a carjacking resulting in death are (1)\n\ntaking or attempted taking from the person or presence of another;\n\n(2) a motor vehicle transported, shipped, or received in interstate\n\nor foreign commerce; (3) through the use of force, violence, or by\n\nintimidation; (4) with the intent to cause death or serious bodily\n\nharm; (5) that results in death.           See 18 U.S.C. § 2119(3); United\n\n\n\n9\n   Alberto also argues in his brief that the government did not\nprove all of the elements of the firearms charge beyond a\nreasonable doubt. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). Because there\nhas been lack of even minimal briefing on appeal, we find that this\nargument has been waived for lack of appropriate argumentation.\nSee United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997)\n(\"We have steadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a\nperfunctory manner, not accompanied by developed argumentation.\").\n\n                                    -14-\n\fStates   v.    García-Álvarez,   541    F.3d       8,   16   (1st     Cir.   2008).\n\nDefendants argue that the government also failed to show any of\n\nthese elements, save the second, beyond a reasonable doubt. Again,\n\nwe disagree.\n\n              To take a motor vehicle from the person or presence of\n\nanother requires, \"at a minimum, proximity to the vehicle and the\n\nability to influence the space encompassing the vehicle . . . .\"\n\nUnited States v. Savarese, 385 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2004).                     \"In\n\nthe carjacking context, courts have required the victim to have\n\nboth a degree of physical proximity to the vehicle and an ability\n\nto control or immediately obtain access to the vehicle.\"                 Id. at 20\n\n(emphasis     omitted).   This   is    not    to    say,     however,    that   the\n\ngovernment must prove that the victim was inside of the vehicle.\n\nIn Savarese, we recognized with approval that \"other circuits have\n\nheld that the presence requirement of the carjacking statute was\n\nsatisfied when the victim or victims were inside a building and the\n\nstolen vehicle was parked outside the building.\"                Id.     Defendants\n\ncontend that there is no evidence on the record that shows they\n\ntook the car from the person or presence of Pérez.                           José's\n\ntestimony that Alberto characterized the taking as having been\n\naccomplished      \"policeman   style,\"       defendants       argue,     was    not\n\nsufficient, as it required the jury to guess the phrase's meaning\n\nwithout further development by the government.                   However, since\n\nthere was evidence presented showing that Pérez had been driving\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fhis usual bolita route in the morning and that later in the\n\nafternoon the car was driven in an unusual manner by a person other\n\nthan Pérez, the jury was entitled to conclude that defendants\n\nabducted Pérez while he was driving his bolita route.             Given this\n\nevidence as well as the testimony that Pérez was transported in his\n\nvehicle   to   José's   house,   a   reasonable    jury   could   have   also\n\nconcluded that Pérez was either in his car at the time of the\n\ncarjacking or sufficiently nearby.          In either case, the government\n\nmet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to this\n\nelement of § 2119(3).\n\n           The second element of the statute, requiring that the\n\nvehicle to be taken \"by force and violence or by intimidation,\"\n\ndoes not present as great an evidentiary barrier.                 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2119.   Indeed, the Supreme Court has indicated that an \"empty\n\nthreat, or intimidating bluff\" is enough.             Holloway v. United\n\nStates, 526 U.S. 1, 11 (1999).          In arguing that the government\n\npresented insufficient proof of this element, defendants argue\n\nalong similar lines as above -- namely, that testimony that the car\n\nwas obtained \"policeman style\" is too vague to support a jury\n\nfinding on the matter.     We disagree.\n\n           José explained that he understood the phrase \"policeman\n\nstyle\" to mean that \"they stopped the car . . . with the weapon,\n\nand they said, this is the police.\"               This was a reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the phrase which the jury was entitled to credit.\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fHaving further evidence of the presence of a handgun from José's\n\ntestimony, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the\n\ncarjacking was performed at gunpoint.                  Finally, there was also\n\nevidence presented that Pérez was forcibly restrained during the\n\nincident, given the fact that he was handcuffed in the back seat of\n\nhis own vehicle.       A jury was entitled to conclude that Pérez was\n\nabducted through the \"use of force, violence, or intimidation.\"\n\n             The last disputed element of the carjacking offense is\n\nthe intent element, which requires that a vehicle be taken with\n\n\"intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.\"                18 U.S.C. § 2119.\n\nIt is well-settled that the statute does not refer to a carjacking\n\nwhich   merely      happens   to   result     in   death.      United    States   v.\n\nMatos-Quiñones, 456 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 2006)                    (\"[T]his statute\n\nis not a felony murder analog.             Even if death results, the statute\n\nrequires intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.\") (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).           Rather, the statute requires that the\n\ndefendant possessed either actual or conditional intent to cause\n\ndeath   or   serious    bodily     harm     to   the   carjacking     victim.     In\n\nHolloway,     the     Supreme      Court    explained       that    \"[t]he   intent\n\nrequirement of sec. 2119 is satisfied when the Government proves\n\nthat at the moment the defendant demanded or took control over the\n\ndriver's automobile the defendant possessed the intent to seriously\n\nharm or kill the driver if necessary to steal the car (or,\n\nalternatively, if unnecessary to steal the car).\"                   526 U.S. at 12.\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fEven if the defendant did not intend to kill the driver, the intent\n\nelement is satisfied if the defendant was willing to kill the\n\ndriver to effect the theft of the car.             The parenthetical at the\n\nend of the quotation implies that the Court saw a distinction\n\nbetween killing for its own sake and willingness to kill to effect\n\nthe theft, and that it deemed both circumstances as meeting the\n\nintent standard of § 2119.\n\n           This actual or conditional intent must be formed \"at the\n\nmoment the defendant demanded or took control over the driver's\n\nautomobile . . . .\"     Id.;    see also United States v. Evans-García,\n\n322 F.3d 110, 114 (1st Cir. 2003);           United States v. Rosario-Díaz,\n\n202 F.3d 54, 63 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[T]he mental state required by\n\nthe statute . . . is measured at the moment that the defendant\n\ndemands or takes control of the vehicle.\").\n\n           Defendants    argue    that       the   government   presented     no\n\nevidence   to   show   that    they   had    formed   either    an   actual   or\n\nconditional intent to kill or seriously injure Pérez at the moment\n\nthe carjacking occurred.        The only evidence on this point, they\n\ncontend, points to precisely the opposite conclusion -- that\n\ndefendants meant to rob Pérez and ended up killing him after the\n\ncarjacking, when he became difficult.10\n\n\n\n\n10\n    José testified that Gabriel told him, \"We had to kill him\nbecause it got real difficult for us and he struggled a lot.\"\n\n                                      -18-\n\f             We considered very similar facts in Matos-Quiñones.              In\n\nthat case, the defendants took the victim's car keys and forced\n\nhim, at gunpoint, to lie down in the rear of the vehicle, while\n\nthey drove away.11     Later, after discovering that the victim was a\n\nsailor, defendants decided to kill him.            Matos-Quiñones, 456 F.3d\n\nat 16.      They stopped in a secluded area, then, after a struggle\n\nprompted by an escape attempt, defendants shot the victim in the\n\nback   of    the   head,   killing    him.   Id.    at   16-17.      Thus,     in\n\nMatos-Quiñones, we were faced with a situation in which a carjacker\n\nstole a car, held the owner hostage, and later killed him.                  These\n\ncircumstances raised the question of whether the moment of the\n\ncarjacking, at which point the actual or conditional intent must\n\nmanifest, could be extended from the initial taking to a later\n\nperiod in time by virtue of holding the victim hostage.             We did not\n\ndecide      this   issue   in   Matos-Quiñones,     however,      because     the\n\ndefendants pleaded guilty.           Likewise, we do not see the need to\n\ndecide it presently, as we believe that in this case a reasonable\n\njury had enough evidence to conclude that defendants possessed\n\neither actual or conditional intent to cause the death of Pérez, or\n\nto inflict upon him serious bodily harm, at the moment they took\n\nhis vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n11\n    This seems to correlate with the \"policeman style\" abduction\nmethod used by Alberto and Gabriel.\n\n                                      -19-\n\f           The evidence on the record, taken as a whole, supports\n\nthe inference that defendants intended or were willing to seriously\n\ninjure or kill Pérez when they committed the carjacking.         For one,\n\nthere was evidence presented that defendants used a handgun to\n\nabduct Pérez.   It is true that this fact alone would not support a\n\nfinding of actual or conditional intent. See Holloway, 526 U.S. at\n\n11-12 n.13 (\"[W]e have found no case of a conviction of assault\n\nwith intent to kill or murder, upon proof only of the levelling of\n\na gun or pistol.\") (internal quotations omitted).            That is not,\n\nhowever, the full extent of the evidence presented to the jury on\n\nthis issue.   There was also testimony that could lead a reasonable\n\njury to conclude that Alberto and Gabriel abducted Pérez while he\n\nwas in his own vehicle.       Additionally, there was testimony that\n\nPérez was restrained with handcuffs when he arrived at José's\n\nhouse.    Finally, Pérez's cries for help during his attempted\n\nescape12 lead to the inference that he felt his life was threatened.\n\nThis   conclusion   is   reasonable,   given   defendants'   displays   of\n\nviolence during the ordeal, and their ultimate act of asphyxiating\n\nPérez.13 Taken in conjunction, and viewing ambiguities in the light\n\n\n12\n   José's neighbor Ramos heard Pérez shout \"Help, they want to kill\nme,\" as he struggled to escape.\n13\n   We do not believe, and, as discussed above, our prior cases do\nnot support, that the act of killing alone satisfies the intent\nelement of § 2119. Common sense, however, dictates that the final\nact, at the very least, evidences the intent. Cf. United States v.\nLebrón-Cepeda, 324 F.3d 52, 64 (1st Cir. 2003) (per curiam)\n(Howard, J., concurring) (\"In my view, we could have affirmed\n\n                                  -20-\n\fmost favorable to the verdict, this evidence could plausibly lead\n\na reasonable jury to conclude that Alberto and Gabriel were at\n\nleast willing to seriously injure, if not kill Pérez, at the moment\n\nof   the   carjacking   given   the   evidence   that   defendants   used   a\n\nrevolver, put Pérez in handcuffs, and placed him in his own car,\n\nwere willing to and did use violence to prevent his escape, and\n\nthen did actually kill him after an extended period of holding him\n\nhostage.    Cf. United States v. Lebrón-Cepeda, 324 F.3d 52, 57 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (per curiam) (holding that conditional intent to kill\n\ncould be inferred from fact that defendant placed a gun against the\n\nvictim's head and threatened him, even though the actual killing\n\noccurred at a later time).            We therefore hold that sufficient\n\nevidence was presented to allow a reasonable jury to find that the\n\ngovernment satisfied its burden of proving the intent element of\n\n§ 2119(3).\n\n            B.   Admission of Alberto's Statements\n\n            Gabriel appeals the district court's decision to allow\n\nintroduction of Alberto's recorded statements from his telephone\n\ncall with his mother.        Admission of this evidence, he argues,\n\nviolated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth\n\nAmendment, as outlined by the Supreme Court precedents of Crawford\n\n\n\n\n[defendant's] conviction simply because he intentionally shot [the\nvictim] in the head at close range during the actus reus, thus\nmanifesting an intention to seriously harm or kill him.\").\n\n                                      -21-\n\fv. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), and Bruton v. United States,\n\n391 U.S. 123 (1968).\n\n              Gabriel did not properly preserve his Crawford objection,\n\nso our review is for plain error only.                     See United States v.\n\nDuarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).                      Since Gabriel did\n\npreserve his Bruton objection at trial, we review the district\n\ncourt's determination under Bruton de novo. United States v. Vega-\n\nMolina, 407 F.3d 511, 519 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n              The Supreme Court's decision in Crawford stands for the\n\nproposition     that       \"the   Confrontation      Clause   bars    admission    of\n\ntestimonial hearsay in a criminal case unless the declarant is\n\nunavailable     and    the    accused   has    had    a   prior    opportunity    for\n\ncross-examination.\" United States v. Earle, 488 F.3d 537, 542 (1st\n\nCir. 2007) (citing Crawford, 541 U.S. at 68).                     The parties agree\n\nthat Alberto was unavailable for cross-examination, as he invoked\n\nhis   right    not    to    testify.    Thus,     admissibility       of   Alberto's\n\nconversation would violate defendant Gabriel's Confrontation Clause\n\nrights unless the statements were either non-testimonial or not\n\nhearsay. Since Gabriel does not challenge whether or not Alberto's\n\nstatements were hearsay, we turn to the question of whether they\n\nwere testimonial.14\n\n\n14\n   Gabriel does not challenge whether or not Alberto's statements\nwere hearsay.    Prior to the Supreme Court ruling in Davis v.\nWashington, 547 U.S. 813 (2006), courts employed an additional line\nof Confrontation Clause analysis for non-testimonial hearsay. See\nHorton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75, 84 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"Crawford draws\n\n                                        -22-\n\f           The Supreme Court provides the following examples to\n\nguide a court's determination of whether an out-of-court statement\n\nis testimonial:    Testimonial statements take the form of 1) \"ex\n\nparte   in-court   testimony   or    its   functional   equivalent;\"   2)\n\n\"extrajudicial statements . . . contained in formalized testimonial\n\nmaterials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or\n\nconfessions;\" and 3) \"statements that were made under circumstances\n\nwhich would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that\n\nthe statement would be available for use at a later trial.\"\n\nCrawford, 541 U.S. at 51-52 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nFurthermore, this Circuit has stated that, in determining whether\n\na statement is testimonial, a court should consider whether \"an\n\nobjectively reasonable person in [the declarant's] shoes would\n\nunderstand that the statement would be used in prosecuting [the\n\n\n\n\na distinction between testimonial and non-testimonial hearsay and\napplies only to the former category of statements.\"). Thus, when\nit was handed down, Crawford did not change the test for non-\ntestimonial hearsay, which could only be admitted based on a\n\"'firmly rooted hearsay exception' or [if it bore] 'particularized\nguarantees of trustworthiness.'\" Crawford, 541 U.S. at 60 (quoting\nOhio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 66 (1980)). In other words, until\nDavis, Roberts remained the controlling precedent for judging\nwhether non-testimonial hearsay violated the Confrontation Clause.\nAfter Davis, however, non-testimonial hearsay no longer implicates\nthe Confrontation Clause at all. See Earle, 488 F.3d at 542; see\nalso United States v. Rodríguez-Berríos, 573 F.3d 55, 61 n.4 (1st\nCir. 2009). So, a finding that Alberto's conversation was non-\ntestimonial should end the matter, and there is no need to\ndetermine whether or not the non-testimonial hearsay qualifies as\na firmly rooted exception or if it bears the particularized\nguarantees of trustworthiness.\n\n                                    -23-\n\fdefendant] at trial.\"    United States v. Maher, 454 F.3d 13, 21 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n            Gabriel notes that Alberto was repeatedly warned that his\n\ntelephone   conversations     were    recorded.        Furthermore,      he     was\n\nactually aware of this fact, and even stated in that conversation\n\nthat he could not say much over the telephone.                     Thus, Gabriel\n\nargues, a reasonable person in Alberto's shoes would know that the\n\nconversation    was   being   recorded,      and    would   thus    expect     that\n\nanything he said could be used to prosecute him, making the\n\nstatements testimonial pursuant to Maher. See id. We believe that\n\nGabriel's analysis misses the mark, and that Alberto's statements\n\nwere not made under circumstances that render them testimonial.\n\n            Looking at the examples given by the Supreme Court in\n\nCrawford, it is plain that Alberto's statements to his mother were\n\nnot   \"solemn   declarations      made      to     government      officials    in\n\ncircumstances   that   resemble      the    repudiated      civil-law   mode     of\n\ninterrogation,\" and thus cannot be treated as testimonial.                United\n\nStates v. Brito, 427 F.3d 53, 68 (1st Cir. 2005) (Howard, J.,\n\nconcurring) (quoting Crawford, 541 U.S. at 51).                 He did not make\n\nthe statements to a police officer, during the course of an\n\ninterrogation, or in a structured setting designed to elicit\n\nresponses that intended to be used to prosecute him.                     Rather,\n\nAlberto had a conversation with a close family member without any\n\nintention of assisting in his own prosecution -- in fact, quite the\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fopposite.       Other    courts    have    found    accordingly       in   similar\n\ncircumstances.     See, e.g., United States v. Manfre, 368 F.3d 832,\n\n838 n.1 (8th Cir. 2004) (\"[Declarant's] comments were made to loved\n\nones   or   acquaintances    and   are     not   the   kind   of   memorialized,\n\njudicial-process-created evidence of which Crawford speaks.\");\n\nSaechao v. Oregon, 249 F. App'x 678 (9th Cir. 2007) (unpublished\n\nopinion) (holding that jailhouse conversation over the phone with\n\nan acquaintance was not testimonial, as declarant did not have the\n\npurpose of supplying prosecution with evidence).\n\n             Gabriel also challenges the admitted statements under\n\nBruton.     In Bruton, the Supreme Court held that, in a joint trial,\n\na   non-testifying      defendant's   confession       that    was    \"powerfully\n\nincriminating\" against a co-defendant could not be admitted, as any\n\nlimiting     instruction     would    be     inadequate       to     relieve   the\n\nConfrontation Clause problems. 391 U.S. at 135; Furr v. Brady, 440\n\nF.3d 34, 37 (1st Cir. 2006).          However, as the companion opinion\n\nexplains, the Bruton rule does not apply to non-testimonial hearsay\n\nstatements.     See Figueroa Cartagena, No. 08-2110.               Since we have\n\ndetermined that the recorded conversation was non-testimonial,\n\nBruton is not implicated.\n\n             We therefore conclude that the recorded conversation was\n\nproperly admitted.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\f            C.   Prosecutor's Statements During Closing Arguments\n\n            Defendant Gabriel enumerates a litany of statements made\n\nby the prosecutor during her closing arguments that he contends\n\nwarrant a new trial because they unfairly prejudiced the jury, and\n\nwere not overcome by instructions from the judge.                     He also argues\n\nthat the government's case lacked the strength to overcome the\n\nprejudice    caused    by    the    prosecutor's        individual     and   combined\n\nclosing argument errors.            Since Gabriel did not object to these\n\nstatements during trial, our review is for plain error only.\n\nUnited States v. Henderson, 320 F.3d 92, 105 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\"[Plain]    error     will    not     be    recognized     unless      it    caused   a\n\nmiscarriage of justice or seriously undermined the integrity or\n\npublic    reputation    of     judicial          proceedings.\"        Id.

(quoting United States v. Nelson-Rodríguez, 319\n\nF.3d 12, 38 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           First,    Gabriel    challenges    two     of   the   prosecutor's\n\nstatements   which   he   contends    reflected     the    prosecutor's      own\n\nopinions regarding her witness's credibility.              We have held that\n\n\"[a] prosecutor improperly vouches for a witness when she . . .\n\nimpart[s] her personal belief in a witness's veracity or impli[es]\n\nthat the jury should credit the prosecution's evidence simply\n\nbecause   the   government     can   be   trusted.\"        United   States   v.\n\nPérez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2003); United States v.\n\nFlores-De-Jesús, 569 F.3d 8, 18 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n           Gabriel's challenge under this rubric is to the statement\n\nmade by the prosecutor that \"José Figueroa-Cartagena comes into\n\ncourt and tells you under oath.\"            We dispose of this challenge\n\neasily, as the statements that José testified under oath merely\n\nstated a fact and were neither a personal assurance, nor invoked\n\nthe prestige of the government.           See Pérez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d at 10\n\n(finding no improper vouching since prosecutor \"neither expressed\n\nher personal opinion regarding the veracity of any witness nor\n\nimplied that [the witness] should be trusted because of some\n\nconnection to the government\").             We thus do not believe the\n\ndistrict court committed plain error in allowing the jury to hear\n\nthis statement.\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\f            The next statements that Gabriel challenges referred to\n\nanother of the prosecutor's witnesses and the victim's wife,\n\nRosario.    Gabriel quotes statements made by the prosecutor at\n\nclosing argument and alleges that they impermissibly bolstered\n\nRosario's credibility.     We reproduce the challenged portion of the\n\nclosing argument below.15\n\n                   And she made a mistake referencing the\n            photo spreads, because she had two photo\n            spreads before her at the time.\n                   But she clarified that, and I think her\n            testimony was very clear that when she wrote\n            these words, she's referring to the photograph\n            of Félix Gabriel Castro-Davis. \"It looks\n            familiar to me. To me, it is a young man who\n            entered my house. I'm not sure, but the young\n            man at that time was thinner. I've seen this\n            kid in barrio San Antonio in Caguas.\"\n                   Compare   that   photograph   of  Félix\n            Gabriel Castro-Davis to the photograph of\n            Félix Gabriel Castro-Davis on August 10, 2006.\n            What would that be? Like two to three -- three\n            to four weeks later. Here is Félix Gabriel on\n            the photo spread that [Rosario] saw, and here\n            is the photograph of Félix Gabriel on August\n            10th, 2006.\n                   It seems to me, and I submit to you,\n            that [Rosario] is right on the money. Same\n            guy, just thinner.\n\nWe agree with Gabriel that the prosecutor's statements went too far\n\nin this case.   The phrases \"I think\" and \"it seems to me,\" and the\n\nstatement that the government witness was \"right on the money\" were\n\nimproper.     But   see   Henderson,   320   F.3d   at   106   (noting   that\n\n\"although it is the jury's job to draw the inferences, there is\n\n\n\n15\n     Gabriel only challenged the italicized portions.\n\n                                  -28-\n\fnothing improper in the Government's suggesting which inferences\n\nshould be drawn\") (quoting United States v. Mount, 896 F.2d 612,\n\n625 (1st Cir. 1990).         Nevertheless, given the weight of the\n\nevidence against Gabriel, we find that these statements were not\n\nsufficiently prejudicial as to constitute reversible error.\n\n            Gabriel also challenges the following statement made by\n\nthe   prosecutor     at   closing:    \"What   an   incredible,   terrible\n\ncoincidence    for    the   defendant,      that   [Rosario's]   physical\n\ndescription of him fits him perfectly.\" Rosario testified that the\n\nfirst intruder in her home was tall and skinny and stated that a\n\nphotograph of Gabriel \"looked a lot like that individual\" who broke\n\ninto her home, though she could not certainly state it was the\n\nintruder.     There is no evidence on the record as to Gabriel's\n\nappearance from which to conclude whether \"tall and skinny\" fits\n\nwell as a description of defendant.         However, we do not find this\n\nstatement to be significantly prejudicial given Rosario's testimony\n\nthat Gabriel's photo \"looked a lot like that individual\" who\n\ninvaded her home.\n\n            Gabriel next argues that the prosecutor's statement that\n\nJosé did not know the victim was a bolitero until defendants told\n\nhim so improperly commented on the character of José by implying\n\nthat he was not aware of the victim's illegal activities, as he was\n\nof good character and was not familiar with the criminal world.       As\n\n\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fabove, we do not believe this is the sort of credibility bolstering\n\nthat amounts to plain error and would warrant a new trial.\n\n           Gabriel also challenges a statement by the prosecutor\n\nthat Pérez \"knew the streets.       This is not the first time he\n\nencountered people like [Alberto] and [Gabriel].\"         Gabriel alleges\n\nthat this statement portrayed the defendants as criminals and\n\nimplied they were involved in illegal gambling.      While we will not\n\ncondone   prosecutor   statements   that   malign   the    character   of\n\ndefendants, without evidentiary support or in ways not related to\n\nthe charges, we do not believe that this statement \"so poisoned the\n\nwell\" that a new trial is required.         This statement was also\n\narguably accurate.     There was testimony presented at trial that\n\nPérez once lived two houses away from Gabriel and Alberto, and\n\ntherefore literally knew each other from the streets.          José also\n\ntestified that the day after the murder, Gabriel told him that\n\nPérez was a numbers runner.\n\n           Gabriel also argues that the prosecutor's statement that\n\n\"José . . . said to you that he saw Félix Gabriel Castro-Davis\n\ncarrying a revolver\" was improper, because José only testified that\n\nhe \"noticed that [Alberto] had pulled out a weapon and placed it on\n\ntop of the car on the right side.\"     While it was improper for the\n\nprosecutor to confuse Félix Alberto Castro-Davis with Félix Gabriel\n\nCastro-Davis, we do not think this lone statement amounted to clear\n\nerror.\n\n\n                                -30-\n\f          Gabriel contends that the next error occurred when the\n\nprosecutor stated that there was \"not a single shred of evidence\"\n\nand \"not a single reason\" that José would lie, and also stated that\n\ndefendants did not attempt to cross-examine José.       This statement\n\nwas not improper.     The prosecutor was commenting on the lack of\n\nimpeachment evidence against José, not giving his opinion as to\n\nJosé's credibility.\n\n          Gabriel     finally   challenges   the   prosecutor's   last\n\nstatement to the jury: \"And you hold them accountable for what they\n\ndid, all three of them.   You hold them accountable.\"    We agree with\n\nthe government that this amounts to a request from the prosecutor\n\nto render a guilty verdict.      The government points us to United\n\nStates v. Flaherty, where we stated that \"[t]he prosecutor's\n\nstatement that the Government would ask the jury to return guilty\n\nverdicts does not bring the Government's credibility to bear on the\n\ncase.\"   668 F.2d 566, 597       (1st Cir. 1981).     However, after\n\nFlaherty, the Supreme Court decided United States v. Young, and\n\nheld that a prosecutor was \"in error to try to exhort the jury to\n\n'do its job' [because] that kind of pressure, whether by the\n\nprosecutor or defense counsel, has no place in the administration\n\nof criminal justice.\"      470 U.S. 1, 18 (1985); see also United\n\nStates v. Mandelbaum, 803 F.2d 42, 44 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"There\n\nshould be no suggestion that a jury has a duty to decide one way or\n\nthe other; such an appeal is designed to stir passion and can only\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\fdistract a jury from its actual duty: impartiality.\").            We thus\n\nfind that this statement was improper.         However, given the weight\n\nof the evidence presented against Gabriel and the brevity of the\n\nstatement, we find that it was not sufficiently prejudicial as to\n\nwarrant a new trial.\n\n          Even    though   some    of   the   prosecutor's   remarks   were\n\nimproper, we do not think they so poisoned the well as to require\n\na new trial.   United States v. Vázquez-Botet, 532 F.3d 37, 56 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).    We take note, and register our concern, with the fact\n\nthat there was no contemporaneous objection or request for curative\n\ninstructions, thus depriving the district judge of the opportunity\n\nto provide special or additional instructions with regards to the\n\nclosing statements, and consequently, failing to provide defendants\n\nof the type of diligent defense to which they are entitled.\n\nHowever, the court's general closing instructions did properly\n\ncounsel the jury regarding what constituted evidence and the fact\n\nthat they were the sole judges of credibility.          The instructions\n\nspecifically reminded jurors they were the \"sole judges of the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses\" and that \"arguments and statements of\n\ncounsel are not evidence.\"        Given the evidence presented at trial\n\nfrom multiple witnesses, any potentially harmful effect from the\n\nprosecutor's closing was safeguarded by the district court's final\n\njury instructions.     See United States v. Mejía-Lozano, 829 F.2d\n\n\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\f268,   274   (1st    Cir.   1987)   (finding   that   the   district   judge's\n\nstandard instruction was sufficient to overcome any prejudice).\n\n             D.    Sentencing Errors\n\n             Alberto and Gabriel argue that the district court erred\n\nwhen it sentenced them to a mandatory term of life imprisonment for\n\na murder that they were neither charged with nor convicted of\n\ncommitting and seek that their sentence be vacated and remanded.16\n\nBecause both Alberto and Gabriel failed to object during the\n\nsentencing hearing to the district court's misstatement regarding\n\nthe statutory sentence for carjacking, our review is for plain\n\nerror.   United States v. González-Castillo, 562 F.3d 80, 82 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).       Under plain error review, for this Court to correct an\n\nerror not objected to in the district court, \"there must be an\n\n'error' that is 'plain' and that 'affects substantial rights.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993) (alteration\n\nomitted).     If those three factors are all met, this Court has\n\ndiscretion to correct the error if it \"seriously affects the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\n\n\n16\n   Gabriel failed to make this argument in his brief, which would\nnormally mean it would be waived. See United States v. Zannino,\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990). On October 28, 2009, after oral\nargument had concluded, Gabriel filed a motion with this court\nrequesting to join and adopt Alberto's argument that the district\ncourt erred in sentencing the defendant to a mandatory life term\nfor murder where he was convicted of a carjacking resulting in\ndeath. Because we find that Alberto and Gabriel are in the same\nlegal and factual position, and that the interests of justice\ncompel it, we grant Gabriel's motion.\n\n                                      -33-\n\fId. at 736 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).                    We\n\nfind that all four requirements are met in this case.\n\n            The government concedes that the district court committed\n\nplain error during the sentencing hearing and agrees that this\n\nerror warrants vacating Alberto's -- and by adoption, Gabriel's --\n\nsentence    and     remanding   the     case    to   the   district     court    for\n\nresentencing. The district court referred to the defendants' crime\n\nof   conviction      as   \"first     degree     murder     in    the   context    of\n\ncarjacking.\"      The district court compounded its mistake by also\n\nstating on more than one occasion that the statutory penalty for\n\nthe crime was life imprisonment.                This was incorrect since the\n\nstatutory penalty for carjacking resulting in death is \"any number\n\nof years up to life.\"         18 U.S.C. § 2119(3).\n\n            Defendants       also    argue,    and   the   government    does    not\n\ndispute, that this error affected their substantial rights.                       It\n\nappears that because the district court thought that the statutory\n\nsentence was life imprisonment, it felt bound to impose a life\n\nsentence.      We    agree    that    this     affected    the   outcome   of    the\n\nproceedings below, and additionally, that the district court's\n\nerror threatened to compromise the fairness, integrity, and public\n\nreputation of the proceedings.                We thus hold that Alberto and\n\nGabriel's sentence should be vacated and remanded for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -34-\n\f                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons discussed, we affirm the judgment against\n\nFélix Alberto Castro-Davis and Félix Gabriel Castro-Davis's but\n\nreverse and remand their sentences.\n\n          Affirmed, Reversed and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                               -35-\n\f",

Background\n\n            A.   Factual Background2\n\n            On the morning of July 15, 2006, Héctor Pérez-Torres\n\n(\"Pérez\") left his home in Caguas, Puerto Rico at 11:00 am to drive\n\nhis bolita route.3     Pérez had been a bolitero for many years, and\n\nwas driving his wife's 1986 Mazda 626 along his usual route, where\n\nhe would stop to collect lottery bets.    He was seen later that day,\n\naround 3:00 or 4:00 p.m., at the Farmacia San Antonio, which was a\n\nregular stop on his route, by pharmacist Brenda García-Medina\n\n(\"García\").      The pharmacy is located in and adjacent to a section\n\nof the town called El Salchichón, and connected to it by means of\n\na secluded road, which is surrounded by dense vegetation.     Later,\n\nPérez's car was seen driving through El Salchichón, although\n\nwitness Jannette Ocasio-Ortiz (\"Ocasio\") testified that the car she\n\nrecognized as belonging to Pérez was not being operated in the\n\nusual way. While Pérez would ordinarily drive very slowly and honk\n\nhis horn to allow those who wished to play the bolita to approach\n\nhim, on July 15, 2006 the car was driving very quickly.       Ocasio\n\nalso testified that, although she could not see who was driving the\n\ncar, she noticed that the silhouette of the driver was too tall to\n\nbe Pérez.\n\n\n2\n   These facts are drawn from the trial transcript, based on the\nfindings of a reasonable jury.\n3\n  The \"bolita\" is an underground lottery.     Pérez was a \"bolitero,\"\nor numbers runner.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f               Later that evening, José Figueroa-Cartagena (\"José\") was\n\nin his home when he received a telephone call from his sister,\n\nNeliza.        Neliza asked José to step outside, because defendant\n\nGabriel wanted to speak with him.            José complied and spoke with\n\nGabriel, who offered José money to watch Pérez's car, with Pérez\n\ninside.    José agreed and allowed Alberto, who was driving Pérez's\n\nMazda,    to    park   the   car   underneath   a   tent   José   used   in   his\n\nautomotive repair business.          Pérez was in the back seat.\n\n               Alberto and Gabriel proceeded to search the car, and José\n\ntestified that he witnessed Alberto remove a revolver from the car\n\nand place it on the roof.            Though defendants did not appear to\n\nremove anything else from the car, José testified that he overheard\n\nthem having a discussion about an ATM card they found on Pérez's\n\nperson.    José also testified that Alberto bragged to him about the\n\nspeed of the car, and told him that they had taken it \"policeman\n\nstyle.\"        When asked what that meant, José explained that he\n\nunderstood this phrase to mean \"that they stopped the car . . .\n\nwith the weapon, and they said, this is the police.\"\n\n               Alberto and Gabriel then left the area to attempt to\n\nwithdraw money using Pérez's ATM card, leaving José to watch over\n\nPérez, who remained in the back of his Mazda.\n\n               Alone with Pérez, José fielded several requests from his\n\ncaptive which included rolling down the windows and getting him a\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fdrink of water.      At this point, José noticed that Pérez was\n\nhandcuffed.\n\n           While guarding Pérez, José placed a call to defendants,\n\nand spoke with Neliza, who assured him that they would return\n\nsoon.4    Shortly   thereafter,     Pérez   attempted   an    escape,   which\n\nresulted in a struggle between him and José.        In the course of the\n\nstruggle, Pérez shouted: \"Help, they want to kill me.\"              As José\n\nfought with Pérez, Alberto, Gabriel, and Neliza arrived.            Alberto\n\nand   Gabriel   helped   subdue    Pérez.     Hearing   the    ruckus,   two\n\nneighbors, Laura Ramos-Ortiz (\"Ramos\") and Celestina Montañez-\n\nBorges, approached to inquire what was happening.            José told them\n\nnot to worry and not to call the police.         Then, Neliza again told\n\nthe two neighbors to leave.       When they attempted to move in closer,\n\nNeliza and Gabriel closed a gate that divided the properties to\n\nprevent the neighbors' access.\n\n           After this incident, which occurred approximately fifteen\n\nto twenty minutes after Pérez was left in José's custody, José\n\ndrove away to a gas station.        There, he washed the mud off of his\n\ncar and drank a beer.    Gabriel and Alberto arrived with Neliza soon\n\nthereafter in two separate vehicles.           Neliza exited her Grand\n\nVitara sport utility vehicle, to check on José.         Alberto, Gabriel,\n\n\n\n4\n   José testified that he intended to speak with Gabriel, but it\nwas Neliza who answered the phone.    It is unclear whether she\nanswered Gabriel's phone, or if José accidentally called his\nsister's phone.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fand Pérez remained in Pérez's Mazda.            José testified that he saw\n\nthat Gabriel had Pérez in a headlock.       After briefly speaking with\n\nJosé, Alberto, Gabriel and Neliza left the gas station in the\n\nmanner they arrived, and drove off in the same direction.\n\n           Later that night, as she was falling asleep, Pérez's\n\nwife, Luz Rosario-García (\"Rosario\"), was startled by the sound of\n\nintruders.       She investigated and found a young man, whom she\n\ndescribed as tall and skinny, in her home.          The man called Rosario\n\nby name and told her to calm herself.           He also stated that if she\n\nshouted, she would get both herself and the man killed.               Rosario\n\nthen encountered a second intruder, whom she described as tough-\n\nlooking, and wearing a mask and gloves. Rosario testified that she\n\nobserved that the second intruder had a firearm, though she did not\n\nknow what kind it was.     The intruders asked for her ATM card, which\n\nshe   procured    for   them.   They     also    asked    for   her   personal\n\nidentification number to activate the card, and when Rosario began\n\nto recite the number, which was the same as her husband's, the\n\nsecond   intruder   indicated   that   he   already      knew   it.   Rosario\n\ntestified that the intruders then asked for access to her husband's\n\nmoneybox, and when she told them that they would have to wait for\n\nPérez to return, they informed her that they had kidnaped him.\n\nAfter the intruders left, Rosario found that they obtained entry to\n\nher home by using her husband's keys, which they abandoned.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           The next day, July 16, 2006, José saw Neliza and Gabriel\n\nagain at his home.      Gabriel stated that they \"had to kill him,\"\n\nreferring to Pérez, because \"it got real difficult for us and he\n\nstruggled a lot.\"      Gabriel explained that, although Alberto had a\n\ngun, they chose to asphyxiate Pérez with duct tape, because they\n\ndid not want to get the gun dirty.          José testified that both Neliza\n\nand   Gabriel   instructed   him    to   speak   with   the    neighbors   that\n\nattempted to intervene on the previous day, and to secure their\n\nsilence, if necessary, with threats.\n\n           B.   The Investigation\n\n           Pérez's body was found on July 17, 2006 in the backseat\n\nof his Mazda in Caguas.             The cause of death was mechanical\n\nasphyxiation    from   the   duct   tape    on   his   face.    State   agents\n\ncontacted José regarding the events outside his home.             Although he\n\ndid not cooperate at first, he later agreed to speak candidly about\n\nthe incident.\n\n           Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\")\n\npresented Rosario with a spread of photographs, the third depicting\n\nGabriel.   She stated that she recognized the man in the third photo\n\nfrom her neighborhood.        She also stated that he resembled the\n\nunmasked intruder in her home, even though he appeared thinner in\n\nperson than in the photograph. Documenting her impressions for the\n\nagents, she wrote and signed a note that stated: \"With reference to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fnumber three, he looks alike, but I cannot identify whether this is\n\nthe young man who entered my home.\"5\n\n          FBI agents arrested Gabriel and interviewed him.    When\n\nasked about his relationship to Neliza, Gabriel stated that she was\n\nhis girlfriend.   Agents questioned Gabriel about the murder of\n\nPérez, but Gabriel denied any knowledge or involvement. When asked\n\nwhy he had been seen fighting with the victim, Gabriel stated that\n\nNeliza's neighbors were trying to frame him. The agent pointed out\n\nto Gabriel that he had not said where the fight took place.\n\nGabriel continued to deny everything.\n\n          On April 25, 2007, during his pre-trial incarceration,\n\nAlberto spoke to his mother, Carmen Davis, over the telephone. The\n\nconversation was recorded. During the course of this conversation,\n\nAlberto told his mother that \"Neliza is the one who is talking,\"\n\nand \"That bitch is going to fuck us over.\"      As to Gabriel, he\n\nstated, presumably in reference to the police: \"They have a picture\n\nof him and everything.   I saw it.\"\n\n\n\n\n5\n    At trial, Rosario again was not able to make a definite\nidentification, but stated that the photo resembled the unmasked\nintruder:\n\n     [Prosecution]: So what you're telling us is the young man who\n     came into your house looked a lot like this young man in this\n     photo . . . but he was skinnier; is that right?\n\n     [Rosario García]: Correcto, because when he turned the lighter\n     [sic.] on, I tried to look at him to see who he was.\n     Correcto.\n\n                                -9-\n\f            C.   Procedural History\n\n            On April 25, 2007, a grand jury in Puerto Rico returned\n\na three-count indictment charging all three defendants with one\n\ncount each of conspiracy to commit carjacking, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 371; carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2119(3) and\n\n2; and the use and carrying of a firearm during a violent crime, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 2.\n\n            The case proceeded to a jury trial on March 5, 2008.\n\nDuring the jury selection process, the district court judge asked\n\ncounsel whether there were any challenges to potential jurors for\n\ncause.    After two for-cause challenges, the judge asked whether\n\ncounsel wished to exercise any peremptory challenges.               But, the\n\njudge    immediately   assigned   two   jurors   to   act    as   alternates,\n\nessentially combining the regular and peremptory challenges. It is\n\nuncontroverted that this violated Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure, which requires separate regular and peremptory\n\nchallenges for ordinary jurors and alternates.

Defendants argue that\n\nthe government presented no evidence of an agreement or specific\n\nplan to carjack the victim, and thus cannot maintain a conspiracy\n\nconviction.      We do not agree.\n\n            The evidence presented at trial shows a well-orchestrated\n\nplot to carjack and kidnap the victim, which bespeaks a prior\n\nagreement.    First, there was testimony that Alberto and Gabriel\n\nlived two houses away from Pérez, a fact that would allow the jury\n\nto reasonably infer that they were aware of Pérez's dealings and\n\nmovements.    There was also testimony that the last place Pérez\n\nstopped his car before the carjacking was a pharmacy on a secluded\n\ncountry   road     with   lots   of   surrounding     cover    and   vegetation.\n\nMoreover,    the   carjacking     occurred   on   a   bolita    day,   when   one\n\nfamiliar with Pérez's dealings could infer that he was likely to\n\nhave significant amounts of cash in the car. Finally, the presence\n\nof the revolver and the handcuffs used to subdue Pérez could also\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\freasonably lead to an inference of defendants' forethought in\n\nexecuting their heist.

Therefore,\n\nsince   the    carjacking   seems     to    have   been   perpetrated   at   a\n\nspecifically opportune time, in a conveniently secluded place,\n\nusing the tools necessary to pull off the operation, a reasonable\n\njury would have legally sufficient evidence to find that defendants\n\nAlberto and Gabriel planned the crime in advance and possessed the\n\nrequisite intent to support a conviction for conspiracy.\n\n                     2. Carjacking9\n\n              The elements of a carjacking resulting in death are (1)\n\ntaking or attempted taking from the person or presence of another;\n\n(2) a motor vehicle transported, shipped, or received in interstate\n\nor foreign commerce; (3) through the use of force, violence, or by\n\nintimidation; (4) with the intent to cause death or serious bodily\n\nharm; (5) that results in death.

This   is    not    to    say,     however,    that   the\n\ngovernment must prove that the victim was inside of the vehicle.\n\nIn Savarese, we recognized with approval that \"other circuits have\n\nheld that the presence requirement of the carjacking statute was\n\nsatisfied when the victim or victims were inside a building and the\n\nstolen vehicle was parked outside the building.\"                Id.     Defendants\n\ncontend that there is no evidence on the record that shows they\n\ntook the car from the person or presence of Pérez.                           José's\n\ntestimony that Alberto characterized the taking as having been\n\naccomplished      \"policeman   style,\"       defendants       argue,     was    not\n\nsufficient, as it required the jury to guess the phrase's meaning\n\nwithout further development by the government.                   However, since\n\nthere was evidence presented showing that Pérez had been driving\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fhis usual bolita route in the morning and that later in the\n\nafternoon the car was driven in an unusual manner by a person other\n\nthan Pérez, the jury was entitled to conclude that defendants\n\nabducted Pérez while he was driving his bolita route.             Given this\n\nevidence as well as the testimony that Pérez was transported in his\n\nvehicle   to   José's   house,   a   reasonable    jury   could   have   also\n\nconcluded that Pérez was either in his car at the time of the\n\ncarjacking or sufficiently nearby.          In either case, the government\n\nmet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to this\n\nelement of § 2119(3).\n\n           The second element of the statute, requiring that the\n\nvehicle to be taken \"by force and violence or by intimidation,\"\n\ndoes not present as great an evidentiary barrier.                 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2119.   Indeed, the Supreme Court has indicated that an \"empty\n\nthreat, or intimidating bluff\" is enough.             Holloway v.

In arguing that the government\n\npresented insufficient proof of this element, defendants argue\n\nalong similar lines as above -- namely, that testimony that the car\n\nwas obtained \"policeman style\" is too vague to support a jury\n\nfinding on the matter.     We disagree.\n\n           José explained that he understood the phrase \"policeman\n\nstyle\" to mean that \"they stopped the car . . . with the weapon,\n\nand they said, this is the police.\"               This was a reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the phrase which the jury was entitled to credit.\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fHaving further evidence of the presence of a handgun from José's\n\ntestimony, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the\n\ncarjacking was performed at gunpoint.                  Finally, there was also\n\nevidence presented that Pérez was forcibly restrained during the\n\nincident, given the fact that he was handcuffed in the back seat of\n\nhis own vehicle.       A jury was entitled to conclude that Pérez was\n\nabducted through the \"use of force, violence, or intimidation.\"\n\n             The last disputed element of the carjacking offense is\n\nthe intent element, which requires that a vehicle be taken with\n\n\"intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.\"                18 U.S.C. § 2119.\n\nIt is well-settled that the statute does not refer to a carjacking\n\nwhich   merely      happens   to   result     in   death.

The only evidence on this point, they\n\ncontend, points to precisely the opposite conclusion -- that\n\ndefendants meant to rob Pérez and ended up killing him after the\n\ncarjacking, when he became difficult.10\n\n\n\n\n10\n    José testified that Gabriel told him, \"We had to kill him\nbecause it got real difficult for us and he struggled a lot.\"\n\n                                      -18-\n\f             We considered very similar facts in Matos-Quiñones.              In\n\nthat case, the defendants took the victim's car keys and forced\n\nhim, at gunpoint, to lie down in the rear of the vehicle, while\n\nthey drove away.11     Later, after discovering that the victim was a\n\nsailor, defendants decided to kill him.            Matos-Quiñones, 456 F.3d\n\nat 16.      They stopped in a secluded area, then, after a struggle\n\nprompted by an escape attempt, defendants shot the victim in the\n\nback   of    the   head,   killing    him.   Id.    at   16-17.      Thus,     in\n\nMatos-Quiñones, we were faced with a situation in which a carjacker\n\nstole a car, held the owner hostage, and later killed him.                  These\n\ncircumstances raised the question of whether the moment of the\n\ncarjacking, at which point the actual or conditional intent must\n\nmanifest, could be extended from the initial taking to a later\n\nperiod in time by virtue of holding the victim hostage.             We did not\n\ndecide      this   issue   in   Matos-Quiñones,     however,      because     the\n\ndefendants pleaded guilty.           Likewise, we do not see the need to\n\ndecide it presently, as we believe that in this case a reasonable\n\njury had enough evidence to conclude that defendants possessed\n\neither actual or conditional intent to cause the death of Pérez, or\n\nto inflict upon him serious bodily harm, at the moment they took\n\nhis vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n11\n    This seems to correlate with the \"policeman style\" abduction\nmethod used by Alberto and Gabriel.\n\n                                      -19-\n\f           The evidence on the record, taken as a whole, supports\n\nthe inference that defendants intended or were willing to seriously\n\ninjure or kill Pérez when they committed the carjacking.         For one,\n\nthere was evidence presented that defendants used a handgun to\n\nabduct Pérez.   It is true that this fact alone would not support a\n\nfinding of actual or conditional intent. See Holloway, 526 U.S. at\n\n11-12 n.13 (\"[W]e have found no case of a conviction of assault\n\nwith intent to kill or murder, upon proof only of the levelling of\n\na gun or pistol.\") (internal quotations omitted).            That is not,\n\nhowever, the full extent of the evidence presented to the jury on\n\nthis issue.   There was also testimony that could lead a reasonable\n\njury to conclude that Alberto and Gabriel abducted Pérez while he\n\nwas in his own vehicle.       Additionally, there was testimony that\n\nPérez was restrained with handcuffs when he arrived at José's\n\nhouse.    Finally, Pérez's cries for help during his attempted\n\nescape12 lead to the inference that he felt his life was threatened.\n\nThis   conclusion   is   reasonable,   given   defendants'   displays   of\n\nviolence during the ordeal, and their ultimate act of asphyxiating\n\nPérez.13 Taken in conjunction, and viewing ambiguities in the light\n\n\n12\n   José's neighbor Ramos heard Pérez shout \"Help, they want to kill\nme,\" as he struggled to escape.\n13\n   We do not believe, and, as discussed above, our prior cases do\nnot support, that the act of killing alone satisfies the intent\nelement of § 2119. Common sense, however, dictates that the final\nact, at the very least, evidences the intent. Cf.

Thus, when\nit was handed down, Crawford did not change the test for non-\ntestimonial hearsay, which could only be admitted based on a\n\"'firmly rooted hearsay exception' or [if it bore] 'particularized\nguarantees of trustworthiness.'\" Crawford, 541 U.S. at 60 (quoting\nOhio v.

In other words, until\nDavis, Roberts remained the controlling precedent for judging\nwhether non-testimonial hearsay violated the Confrontation Clause.\nAfter Davis, however, non-testimonial hearsay no longer implicates\nthe Confrontation Clause at all.

Furthermore,      he     was\n\nactually aware of this fact, and even stated in that conversation\n\nthat he could not say much over the telephone.                     Thus, Gabriel\n\nargues, a reasonable person in Alberto's shoes would know that the\n\nconversation    was   being   recorded,      and    would   thus    expect     that\n\nanything he said could be used to prosecute him, making the\n\nstatements testimonial pursuant to Maher. See id. We believe that\n\nGabriel's analysis misses the mark, and that Alberto's statements\n\nwere not made under circumstances that render them testimonial.\n\n            Looking at the examples given by the Supreme Court in\n\nCrawford, it is plain that Alberto's statements to his mother were\n\nnot   \"solemn   declarations      made      to     government      officials    in\n\ncircumstances   that   resemble      the    repudiated      civil-law   mode     of\n\ninterrogation,\" and thus cannot be treated as testimonial.

We reproduce the challenged portion of the\n\nclosing argument below.15\n\n                   And she made a mistake referencing the\n            photo spreads, because she had two photo\n            spreads before her at the time.\n                   But she clarified that, and I think her\n            testimony was very clear that when she wrote\n            these words, she's referring to the photograph\n            of Félix Gabriel Castro-Davis. \"It looks\n            familiar to me. To me, it is a young man who\n            entered my house. I'm not sure, but the young\n            man at that time was thinner. I've seen this\n            kid in barrio San Antonio in Caguas.\"\n                   Compare   that   photograph   of  Félix\n            Gabriel Castro-Davis to the photograph of\n            Félix Gabriel Castro-Davis on August 10, 2006.\n            What would that be? Like two to three -- three\n            to four weeks later. Here is Félix Gabriel on\n            the photo spread that [Rosario] saw, and here\n            is the photograph of Félix Gabriel on August\n            10th, 2006.\n                   It seems to me, and I submit to you,\n            that [Rosario] is right on the money. Same\n            guy, just thinner.\n\nWe agree with Gabriel that the prosecutor's statements went too far\n\nin this case.   The phrases \"I think\" and \"it seems to me,\" and the\n\nstatement that the government witness was \"right on the money\" were\n\nimproper.     But   see   Henderson,   320   F.3d   at   106   (noting   that\n\n\"although it is the jury's job to draw the inferences, there is\n\n\n\n15\n     Gabriel only challenged the italicized portions.\n\n                                  -28-\n\fnothing improper in the Government's suggesting which inferences\n\nshould be drawn\") (quoting United States v. Mount, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536973\"><a href=\"/opinion/536973/united-states-v-charles-m-mount/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n625 (1st Cir. 1990).         Nevertheless, given the weight of the\n\nevidence against Gabriel, we find that these statements were not\n\nsufficiently prejudicial as to constitute reversible error.\n\n            Gabriel also challenges the following statement made by\n\nthe   prosecutor     at   closing:    \"What   an   incredible,   terrible\n\ncoincidence    for    the   defendant,      that   [Rosario's]   physical\n\ndescription of him fits him perfectly.\" Rosario testified that the\n\nfirst intruder in her home was tall and skinny and stated that a\n\nphotograph of Gabriel \"looked a lot like that individual\" who broke\n\ninto her home, though she could not certainly state it was the\n\nintruder.     There is no evidence on the record as to Gabriel's\n\nappearance from which to conclude whether \"tall and skinny\" fits\n\nwell as a description of defendant.         However, we do not find this\n\nstatement to be significantly prejudicial given Rosario's testimony\n\nthat Gabriel's photo \"looked a lot like that individual\" who\n\ninvaded her home.\n\n            Gabriel next argues that the prosecutor's statement that\n\nJosé did not know the victim was a bolitero until defendants told\n\nhim so improperly commented on the character of José by implying\n\nthat he was not aware of the victim's illegal activities, as he was\n\nof good character and was not familiar with the criminal world.       As\n\n\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fabove, we do not believe this is the sort of credibility bolstering\n\nthat amounts to plain error and would warrant a new trial.\n\n           Gabriel also challenges a statement by the prosecutor\n\nthat Pérez \"knew the streets.       This is not the first time he\n\nencountered people like [Alberto] and [Gabriel].\"         Gabriel alleges\n\nthat this statement portrayed the defendants as criminals and\n\nimplied they were involved in illegal gambling.      While we will not\n\ncondone   prosecutor   statements   that   malign   the    character   of\n\ndefendants, without evidentiary support or in ways not related to\n\nthe charges, we do not believe that this statement \"so poisoned the\n\nwell\" that a new trial is required.         This statement was also\n\narguably accurate.     There was testimony presented at trial that\n\nPérez once lived two houses away from Gabriel and Alberto, and\n\ntherefore literally knew each other from the streets.          José also\n\ntestified that the day after the murder, Gabriel told him that\n\nPérez was a numbers runner.\n\n           Gabriel also argues that the prosecutor's statement that\n\n\"José . . . said to you that he saw Félix Gabriel Castro-Davis\n\ncarrying a revolver\" was improper, because José only testified that\n\nhe \"noticed that [Alberto] had pulled out a weapon and placed it on\n\ntop of the car on the right side.\"     While it was improper for the\n\nprosecutor to confuse Félix Alberto Castro-Davis with Félix Gabriel\n\nCastro-Davis, we do not think this lone statement amounted to clear\n\nerror.\n\n\n                                -30-\n\f          Gabriel contends that the next error occurred when the\n\nprosecutor stated that there was \"not a single shred of evidence\"\n\nand \"not a single reason\" that José would lie, and also stated that\n\ndefendants did not attempt to cross-examine José.       This statement\n\nwas not improper.     The prosecutor was commenting on the lack of\n\nimpeachment evidence against José, not giving his opinion as to\n\nJosé's credibility.\n\n          Gabriel     finally   challenges   the   prosecutor's   last\n\nstatement to the jury: \"And you hold them accountable for what they\n\ndid, all three of them.   You hold them accountable.\"    We agree with\n\nthe government that this amounts to a request from the prosecutor\n\nto render a guilty verdict.      The government points us to United\n\nStates v. Flaherty, where we stated that \"[t]he prosecutor's\n\nstatement that the Government would ask the jury to return guilty\n\nverdicts does not bring the Government's credibility to bear on the\n\ncase.\"   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398781\"><a href=\"/opinion/398781/united-states-v-thomas-e-flaherty-united-states-of-america-v-james-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 597       (1st Cir. 1981).     However, after\n\nFlaherty, the Supreme Court decided United States v. Young, and\n\nheld that a prosecutor was \"in error to try to exhort the jury to\n\n'do its job' [because] that kind of pressure, whether by the\n\nprosecutor or defense counsel, has no place in the administration\n\nof criminal justice.\"      </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111353\"><a href=\"/opinion/111353/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1985); see also United\n\nStates v.

We thus\n\nfind that this statement was improper.         However, given the weight\n\nof the evidence presented against Gabriel and the brevity of the\n\nstatement, we find that it was not sufficiently prejudicial as to\n\nwarrant a new trial.\n\n          Even    though   some    of   the   prosecutor's   remarks   were\n\nimproper, we do not think they so poisoned the well as to require\n\na new trial.   United States v. Vázquez-Botet, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1425795\"><a href=\"/opinion/1425795/united-states-v-vazquez-botet/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).    We take note, and register our concern, with the fact\n\nthat there was no contemporaneous objection or request for curative\n\ninstructions, thus depriving the district judge of the opportunity\n\nto provide special or additional instructions with regards to the\n\nclosing statements, and consequently, failing to provide defendants\n\nof the type of diligent defense to which they are entitled.\n\nHowever, the court's general closing instructions did properly\n\ncounsel the jury regarding what constituted evidence and the fact\n\nthat they were the sole judges of credibility.          The instructions\n\nspecifically reminded jurors they were the \"sole judges of the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses\" and that \"arguments and statements of\n\ncounsel are not evidence.\"        Given the evidence presented at trial\n\nfrom multiple witnesses, any potentially harmful effect from the\n\nprosecutor's closing was safeguarded by the district court's final\n\njury instructions.     See United States v. Mejía-Lozano, 829 F.2d\n\n\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\f268,   274   (1st    Cir.   1987)   (finding   that   the   district   judge's\n\nstandard instruction was sufficient to overcome any prejudice).\n\n             D.    Sentencing Errors\n\n             Alberto and Gabriel argue that the district court erred\n\nwhen it sentenced them to a mandatory term of life imprisonment for\n\na murder that they were neither charged with nor convicted of\n\ncommitting and seek that their sentence be vacated and remanded.16\n\nBecause both Alberto and Gabriel failed to object during the\n\nsentencing hearing to the district court's misstatement regarding\n\nthe statutory sentence for carjacking, our review is for plain\n\nerror.   United States v. González-Castillo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 82 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).       Under plain error review, for this Court to correct an\n\nerror not objected to in the district court, \"there must be an\n\n'error' that is 'plain' and that 'affects substantial rights.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Olano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732 (1993) (alteration\n\nomitted).     If those three factors are all met, this Court has\n\ndiscretion to correct the error if it \"seriously affects the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\n\n\n16\n   Gabriel failed to make this argument in his brief, which would\nnormally mean it would be waived. See United States v. Zannino,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 1990). On October 28, 2009, after oral\nargument had concluded, Gabriel filed a motion with this court\nrequesting to join and adopt Alberto's argument that the district\ncourt erred in sentencing the defendant to a mandatory life term\nfor murder where he was convicted of a carjacking resulting in\ndeath. Because we find that Alberto and Gabriel are in the same\nlegal and factual position, and that the interests of justice\ncompel it, we grant Gabriel's motion.\n\n                                      -33-\n\fId. at 736 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).                    We\n\nfind that all four requirements are met in this case.\n\n            The government concedes that the district court committed\n\nplain error during the sentencing hearing and agrees that this\n\nerror warrants vacating Alberto's -- and by adoption, Gabriel's --\n\nsentence    and     remanding   the     case    to   the   district     court    for\n\nresentencing. The district court referred to the defendants' crime\n\nof   conviction      as   \"first     degree     murder     in    the   context    of\n\ncarjacking.\"      The district court compounded its mistake by also\n\nstating on more than one occasion that the statutory penalty for\n\nthe crime was life imprisonment.                This was incorrect since the\n\nstatutory penalty for carjacking resulting in death is \"any number\n\nof years up to life.\"         18 U.S.C. § 2119(3).\n\n            Defendants       also    argue,    and   the   government    does    not\n\ndispute, that this error affected their substantial rights.                       It\n\nappears that because the district court thought that the statutory\n\nsentence was life imprisonment, it felt bound to impose a life\n\nsentence.      We    agree    that    this     affected    the   outcome   of    the\n\nproceedings below, and additionally, that the district court's\n\nerror threatened to compromise the fairness, integrity, and public\n\nreputation of the proceedings.                We thus hold that Alberto and\n\nGabriel's sentence should be vacated and remanded for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -34-\n\f                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons discussed, we affirm the judgment against\n\nFélix Alberto Castro-Davis and Félix Gabriel Castro-Davis's but\n\nreverse and remand their sentences.\n\n          Affirmed, Reversed and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                               -35-\n\f</pre>",
