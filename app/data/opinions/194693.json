Appellant Christopher Amann is a child with\n               \n\nlearning  disabilities  who  lives  in  Stow,  Massachusetts.\n\nAppellant Richard Amann is Christopher's father.  Christopher\n\nbegan to attend  public school in  Stow in 1983.   Because he\n\nsuffered from learning disabilities,  the Town was  obligated\n\nunder the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),\n\n20  U.S.C.    1400  et  seq., to  produce  an \"individualized\n\neducation  program\" (IEP) for  him, and to  review and update\n\nthe IEP annually.  See generally Amann v. Stow School System,\n                                                            \n\n982 F.2d 644, 646-47 (1st Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (describing\n\nTown's  obligations under IDEA).  The Town did so until 1987,\n\nwhen Christopher's parents withdrew  him from the Stow school\n\nsystem and placed him in a private school.  \n\n     In 1990,  at the request of  Christopher's parents, Stow\n\ncame up with a new IEP that called for Christopher  to return\n\nto the Stow public schools.  The Amanns rejected this IEP and\n\nchallenged its adequacy in a hearing before the Massachusetts\n\nBureau  of Special Education Appeals (BSEA).  See 20 U.S.C.  \n                                                 \n\n1415(b)(2) (requiring administrative \"due process hearing\" of\n\ncomplaints  about IEPs).   The  BSEA hearing  officer decided\n\nthat Stow's proposed IEP was legally adequate. \n\n     Section   1415(e)(2)  of  the  IDEA  authorizes  parties\n\naggrieved by  agency decisions concerning the  adequacy of an\n\nIEP to bring a civil action in either state or federal court,\n\nseeking \"such relief as the court determines is appropriate.\"\n\n                             -2-\n\nThe Amanns  challenged the BSEA's procedures  and findings in\n\nthe  United  States  District   Court  for  the  District  of\n\nMassachusetts.   The district court affirmed  the validity of\n\nthe IEP, and we did the same on appeal.  Amann v. Stow School\n                                                             \n\nSystem, 982 F.2d at 649-53.\n      \n\n     As  was its  duty  under  the  IDEA,  see  20  U.S.C.   \n                                              \n\n1414(a)(5)  (requiring annual  review  and,  if  appropriate,\n\nrevision  of IEP), Stow  prepared a  new educational  plan to\n\ncover the period March  1991-March 1992.  This IEP,  like its\n\npredecessor, called for Christopher to attend public  schools\n\nin Stow.  The Amanns rejected this IEP, too, and again sought\n\nreview before the  BSEA.   In a decision  dated September  9,\n\n1991, the  BSEA hearing  officer ruled that  Stow's 1991-1992\n\nIEP was  adequate.  On  May 21,  1992, the Amanns  filed this\n\naction  in the district court.   The district court dismissed\n\nthe complaint as untimely.  This appeal followed.  We affirm.\n\n                              I\n                               \n\n     The  IDEA, like  many federal  statutes, does not  set a\n\ntime  limit for lawsuits brought  under its terms.   \"In such\n\nsituations we do not ordinarily assume that Congress intended\n\nthat  there be no time  limit on actions  at all; rather, our\n\ntask is to 'borrow'  the most suitable statute or  other rule\n\nof  timeliness from  some other  source.   We have  generally\n\nconcluded that  Congress intended  that the courts  apply the\n\nmost closely  analogous statute  of  limitations under  state\n\n                             -3-\n\nlaw,\"  DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters,\n                                                            \n\n462  U.S.  151,   158  (1983),  provided  that  \"it   is  not\n\ninconsistent with federal law or policy to do so.\"  Wilson v.\n                                                          \n\nGarcia, 471 U.S. 261, 266-67 (1985).  \n      \n\n     The district court, relying  on Judge Keeton's  decision\n\nin Gertel  v. School Committee of  Brookline School District,\n                                                            \n\n783  F.Supp. 701  (D.Mass. 1992),  \"borrowed\" the  thirty-day\n\nlimitations   period  that  governs   civil  actions  seeking\n\njudicial   review  of  state   agency  decisions   under  the\n\nMassachusetts Administrative Procedure Act, M.G.L. c. 30A,   \n\n14.  Because the Amanns did  not sue until eight months after\n\nthe  BSEA  decision,  the district  court  properly dismissed\n\ntheir  claim  unless the  court's  choice  of the  thirty-day\n\nlimitation period  was somehow incorrect, or  its application\n\nof  the time  bar under  the circumstances  of this  case was\n\nsomehow inappropriate.\n\n                              II\n                                \n\n     Except  to  suggest that  the  Gertel  decision \"set  an\n                                          \n\nimproper precedent,\"  the appellants do not seriously contest\n\nthe district  court's choice  of a limitations  period.   The\n\nappropriate limitations period for  IDEA actions, however, is\n\na question of first impression in this circuit, and the issue\n\nhas  not elsewhere generated  a harmonious judicial response.\n\nSeveral courts,  like the  district court here,  have applied\n\nthe short  (generally 30-day)  limitations  periods found  in\n\n                             -4-\n\nstate administrative procedure  acts, ruling both that  state\n\nadministrative  procedure  laws  are  analogous   to  Section\n\n1415(e)(2),  and  that  their  relatively  brief  limitations\n\nperiods  are  consistent  with  the  IDEA's  goal  of  prompt\n\nresolution  of  disputes  over the  educational  placement of\n\nlearning-disabled   children.     Spiegler  v.   District  of\n                                                             \n\nColumbia, 866  F.2d 461  (D.C.Cir. 1989); Adler  v. Education\n                                                             \n\nDepartment  of  New  York,  760  F.2d  454  (2d  Cir.  1985);\n                         \n\nDepartment of Education v.

Other courts, though they by and\n\nlarge  concede  that   state  administrative  procedure  laws\n\nprovide the closest available analogue to Section 1415(e)(2),\n\nbut see  Tokarcik v. Forest  Hills School District,  665 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n443 (3d Cir. 1981), reason that short limitations periods are\n\nnevertheless  too  inconsistent  with  the  IDEA's  \"goal  of\n\nparental involvement\"  to allow their  application to actions\n\nunder the IDEA.  See Schimmel v. Spillane, 819 F.2d 477  (4th\n                                         \n\nCir.  1987); Scokin v. Texas,  723 F.2d 432  (5th Cir. 1984).\n                            \n\nThese courts have instead borrowed less analogous, but longer\n\n--  and  in  the  courts'  view,  more  compatible  --  state\n\nlimitations periods, such as those applicable to tort claims,\n\nsee Scokin, 723 F.2d  at 438 (two years); Tokarcik,  665 F.2d\n                                                  \n\nat 454 (two years),  or to actions for services  rendered but\n\n                             -5-\n\nnot paid for.  Janzen v. Knox County Board  of Education, 790\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 484, 489 (6th Cir. 1986) (three years).\n\n     We conclude  that the district  court correctly borrowed\n\nMassachusetts'  thirty-day  limitations  period  for  actions\n\nunder its Administrative Procedure  Act.  Since the arguments\n\non  both sides have been well-rehearsed in the cases cited --\n\nand  since the  appellants  have offered  only a  perfunctory\n\nchallenge to the district court's  choice -- we will  attempt\n\nto state our reasons briefly.\n\n     The  Massachusetts  Administrative  Procedure Act  (APA)\n\ncontains  the \"most analogous\"  state law cause  of action to\n\nthe civil action authorized by  Section 1415(e)(2).  Like the\n\nMassachusetts  courts operating  under M.G.L.  c. 30A,    14,\n\ncourts reviewing  agency decisions  under the IDEA  will rely\n\nprimarily  on  the administrative  record, see  Burlington v.\n                                                          \n\nDepartment of Education,  736 F.2d 773,  790 (1st Cir.  1984)\n                       \n\n(\"Burlington II\"), and will  scrutinize the agency action for\n               \n\nprocedural  regularity and substantive validity, but will not\n\n\"impos[e]  their view  of preferable  . .  . methods\"  on the\n\nstate  agency.  Board of  Education v. Rowley,  458 U.S. 176,\n                                             \n\n206-207 (1982); cf. M.G.L. c. 30A   14(7)(g) (requiring court\n                   \n\nto respect agency decision unless arbitrary or capricious, an\n\nabuse  of discretion,  or  otherwise not  in accordance  with\n\nlaw).   Thus, the \"character  of the  hearing\" under  Section\n\n1415(e)(2),  like that  of  the hearing  conducted under  the\n\n                             -6-\n\nMassachusetts   statute,  is  essentially  \"one  of  review.\"\n\nBurlington II, 736 F.2d at 791.\n             \n\n     The short limitations period of the Massachusetts APA is\n\nfully  consistent  with  one  goal  of  the  IDEA:  the quick\n\ndisposition  of   disputes   about  a   handicapped   child's\n\neducational placement.  \"[S]peedy  resolutions to the IEP and\n\nplacement disputes that characterize   1415(e)(2) actions are\n\nnecessary  for  such resolutions  to serve  any substantively\n\nuseful  purposes,\" Bow  School  District v.  Quentin W.,  750\n                                                       \n\nF.Supp. at 550, because \"[c]hildren develop quickly and their\n\nneeds often  change substantially  from year to  year.\"   Id.\n                                                             \n\nSee also Burlington II,  736 F.2d at 798 (\"Delay  in remedial\n                      \n\nteaching is  . . . likely to be highly injurious to [learning\n\ndisabled] children\").    The legislative  history,  statutory\n\nterms,  and regulatory  framework of  the IDEA  all emphasize\n\npromptness  as  an  indispensable  element  of the  statutory\n\nscheme.    See  generally  Spiegler,  866  F.2d  461,  466-67\n                                   \n\n(D.C.Cir.  1989);  Adler,  760  F.2d at  459-60;  Bow  School\n                                                             \n\nDistrict, 750 F.Supp. at 550-51.\n        \n\n     It is true that the thirty-day limitations period may to\n\nsome extent frustrate a  competing goal: parental involvement\n\nin enforcing the IDEA's requirements.  But the imposition  of\n\nany  statute  of  limitations   will  to  some  extent  favor\n   \n\n\"policies   of   repose\"   over  \"substantive   policies   of\n\nenforcement,\" Wilson  v. Garcia,  471 U.S.  at 271, and  this\n                               \n\n                             -7-\n\nfact  alone  is not  a  sufficient reason  for  rejecting the\n\nshorter  limitations period of  a closely  analogous statute.\n\n\"Were it  otherwise, a federal  court should always  prefer a\n\nlonger  statute  of  limitations  over  an  alternative,  but\n\nshorter, period, a  type of approach [the  Supreme Court has]\n\nrejected before.\"  Burnett v. Grattan, 468 U.S. 42, 58 (1984)\n                                     \n\n(Rehnquist, J., dissenting).\n\n     The  potentially  harsh effects  of a  short limitations\n\nperiod,  moreover, are  mitigated  in this  context by  three\n\nfactors which, taken together, so narrow any  \"inconsistency\"\n\nwith  the   goal  of   parental  involvement  as   to  permit\n\napplication of the most analogous  state law.  Cf. Occidental\n                                                             \n\nLife Insurance  Co. v.  EEOC,  432 U.S.  355 (1977)  (finding\n                            \n\npreclusive  inconsistency where application  of state statute\n\nof limitations would  have clashed  fundamentally with  Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Act's requirement that EEOC, an agency\n\nplagued  by backlogs,  engage  in time-consuming  process  of\n\ninvestigation and settlement exploration before filing suit).\n\n     First,  the IDEA  instructs school  authorities  to give\n\nparents notice \"of all  procedures available pursuant to this\n\nsection.\"   20 U.S.C.    1415(b)(1)(D).  Several  courts have\n\ninterpreted  this  provision   to  require   notice  of   any\n\napplicable  limitations  period,  in  order  to  ensure  that\n\nparents who go through the administrative proceedings without\n\nthe  aid of  a lawyer  do not  lose their  right to  judicial\n\n                             -8-\n\nreview merely out of ignorance of the law.  See Spiegler, 866\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at  467; Scokin, 723 F.2d at 438; Gertel, 783 F.Supp. at\n                                             \n\n707;  Bow School District, 750  F.Supp. at 551;  cf. Carl D.,\n                                                            \n\n695 F.2d at 1158 (declining to reach issue).\n\n     Second, the  parents' only obligation during the thirty-\n\nday  period  is  to  decide  whether  to  sue  under  Section\n\n1415(e)(2),  a decision they need  make only after the issues\n                                                  \n\nhave been defined, the  dispute has been heard, and  a record\n\nhas been  created in the administrative forum.  Thus, parents\n\ncontemplating  action   under  the  IDEA   --  like   parties\n\nconsidering action under the Massachusetts APA -- do not bear\n\nthe same  pre-litigation burdens of factual investigation and\n\nlegal  research that face, say, a party who has just suffered\n\nor  discovered  an injury  and  is  thinking about  filing  a\n\nlawsuit.    Cf.  Burnett  v.  Grattan,  468  U.S.   at  50-51\n                                     \n\n(rejecting  use, in  federal civil  rights actions,  of state\n\nlimitations  periods  for  filing  administrative  employment\n\ndiscrimination claims, where  \"practical difficulties  facing\n\nan aggrieved person who  invokes administrative remedies  are\n\nstrikingly different\"  from preparation needed to  initiate a\n\ncivil rights lawsuit). \n\n     Finally,  the IDEA  requires that  IEPs be  reviewed and\n\nrevised at  least annually, 20  U.S.C.   1414(a)(5),  and, as\n\nthe  Amanns' own  experience shows,  allows parents  to begin\n\nlitigating afresh over the merits of  each new IEP.   Parents\n\n                             -9-\n\nwho,  despite notice  of  the limitations  period, \"sleep  on\n\ntheir  rights,\"  therefore,  will   lose  no  more  than  the\n\neducational placement for a single  school year, and will not\n\nhave to wait long for a new opportunity to participate in the\n\ndevelopment, implementation -- and if  needed, administrative\n\nand  judicial review  -- of  their child's  educational plan.\n\nSee Spiegler, 866 F.2d at 468.\n            \n\n                             III\n                                \n\n     The Amanns  contend that,  even if  thirty  days is  the\n\nright limitations  period for IDEA  actions in Massachusetts,\n\nthe time bar should not have  operated to deny them a lawsuit\n\nhere.  They give three reasons for this conclusion.\n\n     First, the  Amanns argue  that they  received inadequate\n\nnotice  of  the  thirty-day  limit.     As  we  have  already\n\ndescribed,  the IDEA directs the states  to \"fully inform the\n\nparents  .  . .  of all  procedures  available,\" 20  U.S.C.  \n\n1415(b)(1)(D),  and   some  courts  have   held  \"that   this\n\nrequirement imposes a duty . . . to give, at the time a final\n\nadministrative  decision  is  rendered, clear  notice  of the\n\navailability of judicial review and of the 30-day limitations\n\nperiod.\"  Spiegler, 866 F.2d at 467.  In Spiegler, the agency\n                                                 \n\ngave no  notice of any time  limit, and the court  of appeals\n\ntherefore refused to  invoke the limitations bar  in the case\n\nunder consideration.  Id. at 469.\n                         \n\n                             -10-\n\n     The Amanns concede that the BSEA gave them notice of the\n\nthirty-day  limitations  period at  the  time  it rendered  a\n\ndecision.  Attached to  the September 9, 1991 decision  was a\n\ndocument entitled \"Effect of  Decision and Rights of Appeal,\"\n\nwhich stated:\n\n     Any party  aggrieved by the  Bureau decision may  file a\n     complaint   in   the   Superior   Court   of   competent\n     jurisdiction  or in  the  District Court  of the  United\n     States  for  Massachusetts  for  review  of  the  Bureau\n     decision.  20 U.S.C. s. 1415(e)(2).  Under Massachusetts\n     General  Laws Chapter  30A, Section  14(1), appeal  of a\n     final Bureau  decision must be  filed within 30  days of\n     receipt of the decision.\n\n     We  agree with  the  district court  in Gertel  that the\n                                                   \n\nnotice  given here, though \"not a model of careful drafting .\n\n. . was sufficient.\"   Gertel, 783 F.Supp. at  708 (assessing\n                             \n\nidentical notice).  We  do not see how the appellants' pro se\n                                                             \n\nstatus  affected the adequacy of  the notice.   If the Amanns\n\nwere,  because of their pro  se status, ignorant  of the law,\n                               \n\nthen the only message they could reasonably have derived from\n\nthe document attached  to the decision  was: You have  thirty\n\ndays in  which to challenge this ruling in court.  And if the\n\nAmanns were,  despite  their lack  of counsel,  knowledgeable\n\nenough  about the workings of  limitations rules to be \"aware\n\nthat   1415(e)(2) provides no statute of  limitation and that\n\ntherefore  one must  be borrowed  from state law,  [then] the\n\nnotice  is  clear that  the position  of the  Commonwealth of\n\nMassachusetts is  that the appropriate limitations  period is\n\n30 days.\"  783 F.Supp. at 708.  Either way, the notice should\n\n                             -11-\n\nhave caused the  appellants to  understand that  they took  a\n\nrisk  if  they did  not exercise  their  right to  sue within\n\nthirty days of receiving the BSEA decision.\n\n     The Amanns'  second argument is that  the defendants are\n\nestopped from  raising a limitations defense  to this action,\n\nwhich challenges the 1991-92 IEP, by virtue of  their failure\n\nto assert the  limitations bar  as a defense  to the  Amanns'\n\nprevious IDEA  action, which  challenged the adequacy  of the\n\n1990-91 IEP.   The simple response is that the  defendants to\n\nthe  previous  action  could  not  have  made  a  limitations\n\ndefense.  M.G.L. c. 30A,   14(1) starts the limitations clock\n\nrunning  upon \"receipt of notice of the final decision of the\n\nagency or if a  petition for rehearing has been  timely filed\n\nwith the agency,  within thirty days after  receipt of notice\n\nof agency denial of such petition for rehearing.\"  The Amanns\n\nfiled a motion for  a rehearing of the BSEA's  1990 decision.\n\nAmann  v.  Stow School  System, 982  F.2d at  648.   The BSEA\n                              \n\ndenied  the motion  on October  15, 1990.   The  Amanns filed\n\ntheir first IDEA complaint  on November 13, 1990, twenty-nine\n\ndays  after the BSEA denied their motion for a rehearing, and\n\ntherefore  within  the  thirty-day limitations  period.    We\n\ncannot  fault the  defendants for failing  to make  a defense\n\nthey did not have.\n\n     Finally, the Amanns say  that the new limitations period\n\nshould not be \"retroactively applied\" to their case.  But the\n\n                             -12-\n\npractice  of  making judicial  decisions  \"fully retroactive,\n\napplying  both to  the parties  before the  court and  to all\n\nothers by  and against whom  claims may be  pressed . .  . is\n\noverwhelmingly  the   norm,  and  is  in   keeping  with  the\n\ntraditional  function of  the courts  to decide  cases before\n\nthem based upon their best current understanding of the law.\"\n\nJames B.

Appellant Christopher Amann is a child with\n               \n\nlearning  disabilities  who  lives  in  Stow,  Massachusetts.\n\nAppellant Richard Amann is Christopher's father.  Christopher\n\nbegan to attend  public school in  Stow in 1983.   Because he\n\nsuffered from learning disabilities,  the Town was  obligated\n\nunder the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),\n\n20  U.S.C.    1400  et  seq., to  produce  an \"individualized\n\neducation  program\" (IEP) for  him, and to  review and update\n\nthe IEP annually.  See generally Amann v. Stow School System,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597411\"><a href=\"/opinion/597411/christopher-amann-v-stow-school-system/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 646-47 (1st Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (describing\n\nTown's  obligations under IDEA).  The Town did so until 1987,\n\nwhen Christopher's parents withdrew  him from the Stow school\n\nsystem and placed him in a private school.  \n\n     In 1990,  at the request of  Christopher's parents, Stow\n\ncame up with a new IEP that called for Christopher  to return\n\nto the Stow public schools.  The Amanns rejected this IEP and\n\nchallenged its adequacy in a hearing before the Massachusetts\n\nBureau  of Special Education Appeals (BSEA).  See 20 U.S.C.  \n                                                 \n\n1415(b)(2) (requiring administrative \"due process hearing\" of\n\ncomplaints  about IEPs).   The  BSEA hearing  officer decided\n\nthat Stow's proposed IEP was legally adequate. \n\n     Section   1415(e)(2)  of  the  IDEA  authorizes  parties\n\naggrieved by  agency decisions concerning the  adequacy of an\n\nIEP to bring a civil action in either state or federal court,\n\nseeking \"such relief as the court determines is appropriate.\"\n\n                             -2-\n\nThe Amanns  challenged the BSEA's procedures  and findings in\n\nthe  United  States  District   Court  for  the  District  of\n\nMassachusetts.   The district court affirmed  the validity of\n\nthe IEP, and we did the same on appeal.  Amann v.

This IEP,  like its\n\npredecessor, called for Christopher to attend public  schools\n\nin Stow.  The Amanns rejected this IEP, too, and again sought\n\nreview before the  BSEA.   In a decision  dated September  9,\n\n1991, the  BSEA hearing  officer ruled that  Stow's 1991-1992\n\nIEP was  adequate.  On  May 21,  1992, the Amanns  filed this\n\naction  in the district court.   The district court dismissed\n\nthe complaint as untimely.  This appeal followed.

They give three reasons for this conclusion.\n\n     First, the  Amanns argue  that they  received inadequate\n\nnotice  of  the  thirty-day  limit.     As  we  have  already\n\ndescribed,  the IDEA directs the states  to \"fully inform the\n\nparents  .  . .  of all  procedures  available,\" 20  U.S.C.  \n\n1415(b)(1)(D),  and   some  courts  have   held  \"that   this\n\nrequirement imposes a duty . . . to give, at the time a final\n\nadministrative  decision  is  rendered, clear  notice  of the\n\navailability of judicial review and of the 30-day limitations\n\nperiod.\"  Spiegler, 866 F.2d at 467.  In Spiegler, the agency\n                                                 \n\ngave no  notice of any time  limit, and the court  of appeals\n\ntherefore refused to  invoke the limitations bar  in the case\n\nunder consideration.

Attached to  the September 9, 1991 decision  was a\n\ndocument entitled \"Effect of  Decision and Rights of Appeal,\"\n\nwhich stated:\n\n     Any party  aggrieved by the  Bureau decision may  file a\n     complaint   in   the   Superior   Court   of   competent\n     jurisdiction  or in  the  District Court  of the  United\n     States  for  Massachusetts  for  review  of  the  Bureau\n     decision.  20 U.S.C. s. 1415(e)(2).  Under Massachusetts\n     General  Laws Chapter  30A, Section  14(1), appeal  of a\n     final Bureau  decision must be  filed within 30  days of\n     receipt of the decision.\n\n     We  agree with  the  district court  in Gertel  that the\n                                                   \n\nnotice  given here, though \"not a model of careful drafting .\n\n. . was sufficient.\"   Gertel, 783 F.Supp. at  708 (assessing\n                             \n\nidentical notice).

Either way, the notice should\n\n                             -11-\n\nhave caused the  appellants to  understand that  they took  a\n\nrisk  if  they did  not exercise  their  right to  sue within\n\nthirty days of receiving the BSEA decision.\n\n     The Amanns'  second argument is that  the defendants are\n\nestopped from  raising a limitations defense  to this action,\n\nwhich challenges the 1991-92 IEP, by virtue of  their failure\n\nto assert the  limitations bar  as a defense  to the  Amanns'\n\nprevious IDEA  action, which  challenged the adequacy  of the\n\n1990-91 IEP.   The simple response is that the  defendants to\n\nthe  previous  action  could  not  have  made  a  limitations\n\ndefense.  M.G.L. c. 30A,   14(1) starts the limitations clock\n\nrunning  upon \"receipt of notice of the final decision of the\n\nagency or if a  petition for rehearing has been  timely filed\n\nwith the agency,  within thirty days after  receipt of notice\n\nof agency denial of such petition for rehearing.\"  The Amanns\n\nfiled a motion for  a rehearing of the BSEA's  1990 decision.\n\nAmann  v.  Stow School  System, 982  F.2d at  648.   The BSEA\n                              \n\ndenied  the motion  on October  15, 1990.   The  Amanns filed\n\ntheir first IDEA complaint  on November 13, 1990, twenty-nine\n\ndays  after the BSEA denied their motion for a rehearing, and\n\ntherefore  within  the  thirty-day limitations  period.    We\n\ncannot  fault the  defendants for failing  to make  a defense\n\nthey did not have.\n\n     Finally, the Amanns say  that the new limitations period\n\nshould not be \"retroactively applied\" to their case.  But the\n\n                             -12-\n\npractice  of  making judicial  decisions  \"fully retroactive,\n\napplying  both to  the parties  before the  court and  to all\n\nothers by  and against whom  claims may be  pressed . .  . is\n\noverwhelmingly  the   norm,  and  is  in   keeping  with  the\n\ntraditional  function of  the courts  to decide  cases before\n\nthem based upon their best current understanding of the law.\"\n\nJames B.
