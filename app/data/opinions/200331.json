Plaintiffs-appellants were\n\nall arrested in Rhode Island for non-violent, non-drug related\n\nminor offenses.      After their arrest, the plaintiffs were taken to\n\na Rhode Island prison and subjected to unconstitutional strip and\n\nvisual body cavity searches.         The plaintiffs brought suit against\n\nthe defendants-appellees, who include the State of Rhode Island and\n\nnumerous prison officials, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and various\n\nstate laws for damages sustained as a result of the illegal\n\nsearches.     The district court granted the defendants' motion for\n\nsummary judgment on the ground that the defendants were entitled to\n\nqualified immunity, and therefore shielded from lawsuits seeking\n\ndamages for their actions.         We reverse.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            The state of Rhode Island operates the Adult Correctional\n\nInstitution    (\"ACI\"),    which    consists       of   seven   separate      prison\n\nfacilities.    One of those facilities receives all males committed\n\nto   the   custody   of   Rhode    Island's       Department    of    Corrections,\n\nregardless of the nature of an arrestee's offense.                   This facility\n\nhouses not only pretrial arrestees, but also newly sentenced\n\ninmates awaiting transport to other facilities, pretrial protective\n\ncustody detainees, and sentenced inmates under protective custody.\n\nAll of these individuals are at times commingled with each other,\n\nexcept for those held in protective custody.                Even then, inmates\n\nheld in     protective    custody   use     the    same   facilities     as    other\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fdetainees, but at different times.    Females are processed through\n\na different ACI facility.    At the female facility, arrestees are\n\ncommingled with either sentenced inmates or inmates awaiting trial.\n\n            At the times material hereto, Rhode Island maintained\n\nwritten policies that required new arrestees admitted into ACI to\n\nundergo strip searches and visual body cavity searches.1      These\n\nsearches included \"examination of hair, arms, hands, ears, mouth,\n\nnose; visual examination of groin and rectum; toes and soles of\n\nfeet.\" As part of the searches, males were required to \"lift their\n\npenises and testicles on the officer's command to provide a clear\n\nview of the groin area.\"     Both male and female detainees were\n\nrequired \"to bend over and spread the rectum to provide a clear\n\nview of the area.\"\n\n            On April 20, 1999, Craig Roberts (\"Roberts\") was a\n\npassenger in a car stopped by the police for expired registration\n\nstickers.    A check of police computers revealed that Roberts was\n\nthe subject of an \"outstanding body attachment,\" a type of writ\n\nissued by a magistrate in Rhode Island family court.    The police\n\nfrisked Roberts, but found no weapons or contraband.       Although\n\nRoberts produced a carbon-copy of a family court order withdrawing\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      A \"strip search\" is a visual inspection of an inmate's\nnaked body. A \"visual body cavity search\" is a strip search that\nincludes the visual inspection of an inmate's anal and genital\nareas. See Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 561 n.3 (1st Cir.\n1985).\n\n                                -3-\n\fthe body attachment, the police arrested Roberts and took him to\n\nACI.\n\n              Upon arriving at ACI, Roberts was subjected to a strip\n\nand visual body cavity search pursuant to the written policies\n\ndescribed above.      No weapons or contraband were found.            After the\n\nsearch, Roberts was placed in a segregated cell.               Later that day,\n\nRoberts was subjected to another strip and visual body cavity\n\nsearch   in    preparation       for   his   transportation    to   the   Garrahy\n\nJudicial Complex.          Again, no weapons or contraband were found.\n\nAfter arriving at the complex, Roberts' carbon-copy of the order\n\nwithdrawing the body attachment was shown to a sheriff and Roberts\n\nwas released.\n\n              In 1999, Roberts brought a complaint in the district\n\ncourt alleging that the strip and visual body cavity searches\n\nrequired by Rhode Island's written policies violated his Fourth\n\nAmendment right to be free from unreasonable searches. Upon cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment, the district court ruled that the\n\nsearches were unconstitutional and issued an order enjoining Rhode\n\nIsland from conducting searches in accordance with those written\n\npolicies. Roberts v. Rhode Island, 175 F. Supp.2d 176, 183 (D.R.I.\n\n2000).    On     appeal,    we    affirmed    the   district   court's    ruling.\n\nRoberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 113 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n              In 2000, Roberts and other similarly situated individuals\n\nbrought a separate action in the district court against Rhode\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fIsland and various prison officials alleging that the searches\n\nviolated their constitutional rights and seeking damages under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, state tort law, and state statutory law.                   Like\n\nRoberts, the new plaintiffs all claimed they were arrested for non-\n\nviolent, non-drug related minor offenses and subjected to strip and\n\nvisual body cavity searches at ACI prior to March 17, 2000.           By way\n\nof example, one of the new plaintiffs, George Barber, loaned his\n\ncar to his son in 1993 and the son received a traffic ticket that\n\nwas never paid.    Six years later, Barber was arrested because of\n\nthe unpaid ticket, held at ACI overnight and strip searched twice.\n\nAnother plaintiff, Stephanie Clark, called police for assistance\n\nafter an auto accident and was arrested because a computer check\n\nshowed an outstanding arrest warrant for her failure to appear at\n\na probation review.    Clark had already finished her probation and\n\nthe warrant was issued in error.            She was taken to ACI and strip\n\nsearched twice.\n\n           Upon the defendants' motion, the district court dismissed\n\nRoberts'   claim   based   on   the    doctrine    of   res   judicata.    The\n\ndefendants then moved for summary judgment as to the remaining\n\nplaintiffs.   The district court granted the motion on the ground\n\nthat qualified immunity shielded the defendants from damages.\n\nAccording to the district court, the defendants were entitled to\n\nqualified immunity because it was not the \"clearly established\" law\n\nin this circuit that prison officials needed at least reasonable\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fsuspicion that arrestees for minor offenses were carrying weapons\n\nor contraband before conducting strip and visual body cavity\n\nsearches.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n            We review a district court's grant of a motion for\n\nsummary judgment de novo; we examine the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable   to   the    non-moving        party,    and   draw   all   reasonable\n\ninferences in its favor.            See Sands v. Ridefilm Corp., 212 F.3d\n\n657, 660 (1st Cir. 2000).       A motion for summary judgment should be\n\ngranted only     if    there   is    an   absence    of   \"sufficient   evidence\n\nfavoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for\n\nthat party.\"     Id. at 61 (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,\n\n477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986)).\n\n            \"Qualified immunity specially protects public officials\n\nfrom the specter of damages liability for judgment calls made in a\n\nlegally uncertain environment.\"             Ryder v. United States, 515 U.S.\n\n177, 185 (1995). The purpose of the qualified immunity doctrine is\n\nto balance the need to vindicate constitutional rights against the\n\nneed to protect public officials from litigation that could inhibit\n\nthe discharge of their duties. See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S.\n\n635, 638 (1987).       In balancing those needs, we use a three step\n\nanalysis.    See Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office of the Suffolk\n\nDist., 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f1.   Violation of a Constitutional Right\n\n           The first step is to ask whether the facts alleged by the\n\nplaintiffs show that the conduct of the public officials violated\n\na constitutional right.    See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201\n\n(2001); Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 609 (1999).          The district\n\ncourt's decision, and our affirmance, in Roberts' earlier lawsuit\n\nmakes clear that Rhode Island's strip and visual body cavity\n\nsearches without reasonable suspicion violated a constitutional\n\nright.   See Roberts, 239 F.3d at 113; Roberts, 175 F. Supp.2d at\n\n183.\n\n2.   Clearly Established\n\n           The second step is to ask \"whether that right was clearly\n\nestablished at the time of the alleged violation.\"                Conn v.\n\nGabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 290 (1999).     The purpose of this step is \"to\n\nensure that before they are subjected to suit, officers are on\n\nnotice their conduct is unlawful.\"     Saucier, 533 U.S. at 206.     This\n\nmeans that in the present case we must determine whether it was the\n\nclearly established law that prison officials needed at least\n\nreasonable suspicion before subjecting the plaintiffs to strip and\n\nvisual body cavity searches.\n\n           The district court held that the law was not clearly\n\nestablished.    In doing so, the district court based its decision\n\nlargely on our statement in Roberts' earlier appeal that \"[t]he\n\ninstitutional   security   concerns    in   play   here   fall   somewhere\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fbetween\"   other   cases   that    have    been   decided    by    this   court.\n\nRoberts, 239 F.3d at 111.         The district court concluded from our\n\nstatement that the unlawfulness of the ACI strip search policy\n\ncould not have been apparent to the defendants.                   After careful\n\nexamination, we think the district court assigned too much meaning\n\nto our statement.    The statement simply recognizes that the facts\n\ninvolved in this case are different than those of previous cases.\n\nThe Supreme Court recently explained in Hope v. Pelzer, 122 S. Ct.\n\n2508, 2516 (2002), that \"officials can still be on notice that\n\ntheir conduct violates established law even in novel factual\n\ncircumstances.\"\n\n           In the same vein, the district court concluded that cases\n\nfrom other circuits were of \"limited application\" to its analysis\n\nbecause they involved different factual predicates than the present\n\ncase.   Specifically, the district court said that cases from other\n\ncircuits \"do not involve institutions designed like the ACI, where\n\npretrial   detainees   are    mixed        in   with   the   general      prison\n\npopulation.\"   To support its conclusion, the district court relied\n\non reasoning from the Eleventh Circuit, which had developed a line\n\nof decisions that found the law \"clearly established\" only when the\n\nfacts of previous cases were materially similar to the present\n\ncase.   See Hope v. Pelzer, 240 F.3d 975, 981 (11th Cir. 2001);\n\nSuissa v. Fulton County, Ga., 74 F.3d 266, 269-70 (11th Cir. 1996);\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fLassiter v. Alabama A&M Univ., Bd. of Trustees, 28 F.3d 1146, 1150\n\n(11th Cir. 1994).\n\n            Shortly after the district court's decision, the Supreme\n\nCourt in Hope explicitly overruled the cases from the Eleventh\n\nCircuit upon which the district court relied.      See 122 S. Ct. at\n\n2515.     The Supreme Court said that considering only those cases\n\nwith similar facts, as the district court did here, is a \"rigid\n\ngloss on the qualified immunity standard . . . [that] is not\n\nconsistent with our cases.\"     Id.    The Court further stated that\n\n\"[a]lthough earlier cases involving 'fundamentally similar' facts\n\ncan provide especially strong support for a conclusion that the law\n\nis clearly established, they are not necessary to such a finding.\"\n\nId.     Our cases are consistent with the Court's decision in Hope.\n\nSee Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth and Their Families, 274 F.3d\n\n12, 22 (1st Cir. 2001); El Dia, Inc. v. Rossello, 165 F.3d 106, 109\n\n(1st Cir. 1999); Germany v. Vance, 868 F.2d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n            We therefore conclude that the district court's analysis\n\nwas flawed because it overemphasized our statement in Roberts'\n\nearlier appeal and failed to properly weigh relevant decisions from\n\nother circuits.     We consider it unnecessary, however, to remand\n\nthis matter to the district court because the question of whether\n\na right is clearly established is an issue of law.      See Singh v.\n\nBlue Cross/Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 308 F.3d 25, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (\"[Q]ualified immunity analysis under § 1983 involves a\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fquintessential legal question:     whether the rights at issue are\n\nclearly established.\"). We instead proceed on our own to determine\n\nwhether our cases, as well as those from other circuits, clearly\n\nestablished that reasonable suspicion was needed before prison\n\nofficials could subject people arrested for minor offenses to strip\n\nand visual body cavity searches.\n\n          We begin by noting that our inquiry is time-sensitive.\n\nSee Hatch, 274 F.3d at 22.    Qualified immunity is available to the\n\ndefendants if, at the time of the alleged violations, the law was\n\nnot clearly established.     See id.    The parties all agree that the\n\noperative date for our analysis is March 17, 2000.\n\n          \"One tried and true way of determining whether [a] right\n\nwas clearly established . . . is to ask whether existing case law\n\ngave the defendants fair warning that their conduct violated the\n\nplaintiff's constitutional rights.\"      Suboh, 298 F.3d at 93.   After\n\nthoroughly reviewing the law, we find that existing cases gave the\n\ndefendants plenty of fair warning that, prior to March 17, 2000,\n\nreasonable suspicion was needed in order to subject people arrested\n\nfor minor offenses to strip and visual body cavity searches.\n\n          The place to start our analysis is with the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).      In that\n\ncase, the Court upheld a strip and visual body cavity search of\n\npretrial detainees.   In doing so, the Court conducted an analysis\n\nthat balanced the need for the searches against the invasion of\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fpersonal rights.     Id. at 559.      Although the Court said that the\n\npractice of strip searching individuals \"instinctively gives us the\n\nmost pause,\" it found the searches constitutional because of the\n\nsecurity needs of the prison.        Id. at 559-60.       But the Court was\n\nclear to delineate the scope of its holding:\n\n            [W]e deal here with the question whether\n            visual body-cavity inspections . . . can ever\n            be conducted on less than probable cause.\n            Balancing the significant and legitimate\n            security interests of the institution against\n            the privacy interests of the inmates, we\n            conclude that they can.\n\nId.   at   560   (emphasis   in   original).       In    other   words,   Bell\n\nestablished the ceiling; it made clear that prison officials did\n\nnot necessarily need probable cause to strip search pretrial\n\ndetainees. But Bell left the floor undefined. Still ambiguous was\n\nwhether    prison   officials     needed   any   level   of   particularized\n\nsuspicion that detainees were carrying contraband or weapons before\n\nconducting strip searches.\n\n            Our early cases applying Bell to the prison environment\n\ndealt largely with situations involving prison visitors. In one of\n\nour first prison visitor cases, Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556,\n\n567 (1st Cir. 1985), we held that:\n\n            [T]he    Constitution    requires    a    more\n            particularized level of suspicion to justify\n            the   humiliating   and   intrusive   searches\n            conducted here. While we need not define here\n            precisely   what   level   of   individualized\n            suspicion is required . . . a rule unabashedly\n            requiring none cannot be reconciled with the\n            Fourth Amendment.\n\n                                    -11-\n\fSee also Cochrane v. Quattrocchi, 949 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n               In Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 928 (1st Cir. 1996), we\n\nclarified that the level of particularized suspicion required\n\nbefore subjecting prison visitors to strip searches was \"reasonable\n\nsuspicion.\"           We said that \"a strip search cannot be justified\n\nabsent some quantum of individualized suspicion.                    In determining\n\nthe level of individualized suspicion . . . courts have converged\n\nupon     one    common       benchmark:       the     standard     of   'reasonable\n\nsuspicion.'\" Id. (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).\n\n               Our    cases    addressing    strip    and   visual      body   cavity\n\nsearches       were    not    limited   to   prison    visitors.        We   required\n\nreasonable suspicion for strip searches at border crossings.                      See\n\nUnited States v. Uricoechea-Casallas, 946 F.2d 162, 166 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).    And most significantly for this case, we demanded in Swain\n\nv. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997), that prison officials\n\npossess reasonable suspicion to conduct strip and visual body\n\ncavity searches of arrestees.\n\n               In Swain, we examined our prior cases dealing with prison\n\nvisitors and border searches, as well as relevant cases from other\n\ncircuits.        We concluded that \"it is clear that at least the\n\nreasonable suspicion standard governs strip and visual body cavity\n\nsearches in the arrestee context as well.\"                  Id.    This ruling was\n\nconsistent with cases from numerous other circuits. See Justice v.\n\nCity of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11th Cir. 1992); Masters\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fv.

Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981), cert.\n\ndenied, 455 U.S. 942 (1982).\n\n             Not only did we hold in Swain that reasonable suspicion\n\nwas required to strip search arrestees, we also determined when\n\nanalyzing the issue of qualified immunity that \"it was clearly\n\nestablished at the time of the search [May 18, 1993] that the\n\nFourth Amendment requires at least a reasonable suspicion to\n\nconduct these types of searches.\"      117 F.3d at 5 (emphasis added).\n\nThis ruling too was in accord with decisions by other circuits.\n\nSee Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 398 (10th Cir. 1993) (holding\n\nthat it was clearly established that a strip search policy applied\n\nto   minor   offense   detainees   without   particularized    reasonable\n\nsuspicion was unlawful); Masters, 872 F.2d at 1255 (\"The decisions\n\nof all the federal courts of appeals that have considered the issue\n\nreached the same conclusion:       a strip search of a person arrested\n\nfor a   traffic   violation   or   other   minor   offense   not   normally\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fassociated     with    violence    and     concerning          whom   there    is    no\n\nindividualized reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is carrying\n\nor concealing a weapon or other contraband, is unreasonable. We\n\nbelieve the right of such a person to be free of such a search was\n\n'clearly established' on October 21, 1986.\"); Weber, 804 F.2d at\n\n803   (denying   qualified    immunity          for   defendants      who   performed\n\nsuspicionless strip searches on arrestees because \"at least eleven\n\ncircuit     court     decisions      .     .     .      hold     similar      policies\n\nunconstitutional\"); Jones, 770 F.2d at 742 n.4 (denying defendants\n\nqualified    immunity    because     the       Fourth    Amendment's        protection\n\nagainst   suspicionless      strip       searches       of     arrestees    was     well\n\nestablished).       In short, the defendants had more than fair warning\n\nthat, prior to March 17, 2000, prison officials needed reasonable\n\nsuspicion that arrestees for minor offenses, like the plaintiffs in\n\nthis case, were concealing contraband or weapons before conducting\n\nstrip and visual body cavity searches.\n\n             The defendants' principal argument is that, despite the\n\noverwhelming     precedent   described          above,    it    was   still   unclear\n\nwhether reasonable suspicion was required when arrestees were\n\ncommingled with a general prison population, as was the case at the\n\nACI facilities.\n\n             Admittedly, our precedent does not speak to commingling\n\nspecifically.       But as early as Blackburn, we rejected the argument\n\nthat \"the security needs of a prison can, standing alone, properly\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fjustify the 'complete withdrawal' of Fourth Amendment rights from\n\nall who enter [a prison].\"       771 F.2d at 563 (emphasis in original);\n\nsee also Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013 (\"An indiscriminate strip search\n\npolicy    routinely    applied     to       detainees    .   .    .   cannot    be\n\nconstitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative\n\nease in attending to security considerations.\").\n\n             Cases from other circuits are more explicit; they refute\n\nthe defendants' argument with such clarity that we have little\n\ntrouble   concluding    that,    when       read   in   conjunction    with     our\n\nopinions, the defendants had fair warning that commingling alone\n\ncould not justify suspicionless strip searches of arrestees.                   Most\n\nnotable is the Sixth Circuit's holding in Masters v. Crouch, 872\n\nF.2d 1248, 1254 (6th Cir. 1989):\n\n             [T]he fact of intermingling [with other prison\n             inmates] alone has never been found to justify\n             such a search without consideration of the\n             nature of the offense and the question of\n             whether there is any reasonable basis for\n             concern that the particular detainee will\n             attempt   to   introduce  weapons   or   other\n             contraband into the institution.\n\n             Other circuits too have found commingling to be an\n\ninsufficient basis upon which to abandon the need for reasonable\n\nsuspicion.    The Second Circuit in Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 68, 69\n\n(2d   Cir.   1988),   ruled   that      a    blanket    strip    search   of   all\n\nmisdemeanor arrestees was not permissible simply because those\n\narrestees were commingled among arraigned inmates.                    The court\n\nexplained that \"the risk of a misdemeanor arrestee's introducing\n\n                                     -15-\n\fcontraband into the general jail population simply did not warrant\n\na strip search of all arrestees and that particularized suspicion\n\nis    required     for   strip-searching         any   person    arrested     for    a\n\nmisdemeanor or other minor offense.\"               Id.\n\n               The Ninth Circuit in Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 618\n\n(9th Cir. 1984), adopted similar logic.                The court explained that\n\nblanket strip search policies cannot deter arrestees from smuggling\n\ncontraband into a jail because arrests are unplanned events.                        Id.\n\nThe    court    concluded   \"that      defendants'       heavy   reliance   on      the\n\nintermingling of its temporary detainees with the general [jail]\n\npopulation is misplaced because such intermingling is both limited\n\nand avoidable.\"      Id. at 619 (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted) (alteration in original).               The Tenth Circuit has held to\n\nthe same effect.         See Chapman, 989 F.2d at 396 (rejecting the\n\ndefendant's argument \"that the invasion posed by his policy is\n\njustified by the need for jail security because women detainees\n\nmust    be     incarcerated       in   one      cell   with   the   general      jail\n\npopulation\");      Hill,    735    F.2d    at    394   (rejecting   intermingling\n\nargument because \"intermingling is only one factor to consider in\n\njudging the constitutionality of a strip search\").\n\n               The defendants' final argument is that our decision in\n\nArruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir. 1983), made the law unclear\n\nregarding the need for reasonable suspicion when strip searching\n\narrestees who would ultimately be commingled with other inmates in\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fa maximum security prison.       In Arruda, we upheld a policy of strip\n\nsearching inmates at MCI-Walpole, a Massachusetts maximum security\n\nprison.   See id. at 888.     Nowhere in that opinion did we articulate\n\na need for reasonable suspicion.           The defendants say that ACI is a\n\nmaximum security prison too, and therefore Arruda suggests that no\n\nreasonable suspicion is needed to conduct strip and visual body\n\ncavity searches of arrestees brought to ACI.                 This argument is\n\nunpersuasive for two reasons. First, as we have already discussed,\n\nour cases since Arruda have made clear that reasonable suspicion is\n\nrequired to strip search arrestees.             See Swain, 117 F.3d at 7.\n\nSecond,   Arruda    was   a   case    involving      \"particularly    dangerous\n\nprisoners.\"     710 F.2d at 887.             The plaintiff himself was a\n\nconvicted   felon    assigned    to    a   special    cell   block,       which   we\n\ndescribed as a \"prison within a prison, designed to hold the most\n\ndangerous inmates.\"       Id.        The plaintiff was assigned to this\n\nspecial cell block for assaulting another prisoner.              In addition,\n\nthe plaintiff testified that, while a prisoner, he possessed drugs\n\nand a weapon.      Id. at 888.\n\n            Based on these facts, we have no difficulty concluding\n\nthat the defendants could not rely on Arruda to justify their\n\nactions. It is simply not reasonable to equate people arrested for\n\nnon-violent, non-drug related minor offenses with a convicted felon\n\nwho,   while   incarcerated,     possessed      contraband    and     a    weapon,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fassaulted a fellow prisoner, and was confined to a special cell\n\nblock designed to hold dangerous inmates.\n\n           In light of our prior case law, as well as decisions from\n\nother circuits, we conclude that the defendants had fair warning\n\nthat subjecting arrestees for minor offenses to strip and visual\n\nbody   cavity    searches    without    any     reasonable   suspicion   was   a\n\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment, even though the arrestees were\n\ncommingled with other inmates. The law was clearly established for\n\npurposes of qualified immunity.\n\n3.   Objective Reasonableness\n\n           Having concluded that the law clearly established the\n\nplaintiffs' right to be free from suspicionless strip and visual\n\nbody cavity searches, we now address the third and final step in\n\nthe qualified immunity analysis.              The defendants are entitled to\n\nqualified immunity if objectively reasonable prison officials in\n\nthe defendants' position would believe that their conduct was\n\nlawful in light of clearly established law.            See Suboh, 298 F.3d at\n\n95; Swain, 117 F.3d at 9.        This is a legal question, but we have\n\nrepeatedly      recognized    that     \"[a]     determination   of   objective\n\nreasonableness 'will often require examination of the information\n\npossessed' by the defendant officials.\" Kelly v. Laforce, 288 F.3d\n\n1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641); see also\n\nBilida v. McCleod, 211 F.3d 166, 174 (1st Cir. 2000); Sheehy v.\n\nTown of Plymouth, 191 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 1999); McBride v.\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fTaylor, 924 F.2d 386, 389 (1st Cir. 1991); Floyd v. Farrell, 765\n\nF.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n          Mindful that the reasonableness inquiry is \"highly fact\n\nspecific,\" Swain 117 F.3d at 9, any determination we make would\n\nrequire examining the record for evidence that the defendants had\n\nreasonable suspicion, albeit mistakenly, that the plaintiffs were\n\nconcealing contraband or weapons.       Reasonable suspicion can arise\n\nfrom a wide variety of circumstances, including \"the crime charged,\n\nthe   particular   characteristics   of   the   arrestee,   and/or   the\n\ncircumstances of the arrest.\"    Weber, 804 F.2d at 802; Giles, 746\n\nF.2d at 617; see also Roberts, 239 F.3d at 113 (stating that\n\nreasonable suspicion can be based on \"observations of a particular\n\ninmate during a less invasive pat-down frisk and clothing search,\n\nor based on contraband found during that search\").\n\n           The record before us, however, is barren of any facts\n\nregarding what the prison officials knew, or did not know, about\n\nthe plaintiffs.    The only facts we have are those from the parties'\n\npleadings and those facts contained in the decisions by this court\n\nand the district court in Roberts' first round of litigation.        The\n\nfacts developed there were based on a \"joint factual stipulation\"\n\nsubmitted by the parties to the district court.        The record now\n\nbefore us does not contain the joint factual stipulation.       Even if\n\nit did, the joint stipulation pertains only to Roberts.       As far as\n\nwe can tell, the parties have not stipulated to all the facts\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fregarding any of the other plaintiffs.              Given the state of the\n\nrecord, we must remand this case to the district court for a\n\ndetermination of the third step in the qualified immunity analysis,\n\nas well as the other issues in the litigation.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            The law was clearly established on March 17, 2000, that\n\npeople arrested for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses\n\ncould not be subjected to strip and visual body cavity searches\n\nabsent reasonable suspicion that they were concealing contraband or\n\nweapons, even when those arrestees were commingled with general\n\nprison   populations.        The     district    court's   decision    granting\n\nqualified    immunity   to     the    defendants-appellees     is     therefore\n\nREVERSED    and   the   case    is    REMANDED    for   further     proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.            Costs on appeal are awarded to\n\nplaintiffs-appellants.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\f",

After their arrest, the plaintiffs were taken to\n\na Rhode Island prison and subjected to unconstitutional strip and\n\nvisual body cavity searches.         The plaintiffs brought suit against\n\nthe defendants-appellees, who include the State of Rhode Island and\n\nnumerous prison officials, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and various\n\nstate laws for damages sustained as a result of the illegal\n\nsearches.     The district court granted the defendants' motion for\n\nsummary judgment on the ground that the defendants were entitled to\n\nqualified immunity, and therefore shielded from lawsuits seeking\n\ndamages for their actions.         We reverse.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            The state of Rhode Island operates the Adult Correctional\n\nInstitution    (\"ACI\"),    which    consists       of   seven   separate      prison\n\nfacilities.    One of those facilities receives all males committed\n\nto   the   custody   of   Rhode    Island's       Department    of    Corrections,\n\nregardless of the nature of an arrestee's offense.                   This facility\n\nhouses not only pretrial arrestees, but also newly sentenced\n\ninmates awaiting transport to other facilities, pretrial protective\n\ncustody detainees, and sentenced inmates under protective custody.\n\nAll of these individuals are at times commingled with each other,\n\nexcept for those held in protective custody.                Even then, inmates\n\nheld in     protective    custody   use     the    same   facilities     as    other\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fdetainees, but at different times.    Females are processed through\n\na different ACI facility.    At the female facility, arrestees are\n\ncommingled with either sentenced inmates or inmates awaiting trial.\n\n            At the times material hereto, Rhode Island maintained\n\nwritten policies that required new arrestees admitted into ACI to\n\nundergo strip searches and visual body cavity searches.1      These\n\nsearches included \"examination of hair, arms, hands, ears, mouth,\n\nnose; visual examination of groin and rectum; toes and soles of\n\nfeet.\" As part of the searches, males were required to \"lift their\n\npenises and testicles on the officer's command to provide a clear\n\nview of the groin area.\"     Both male and female detainees were\n\nrequired \"to bend over and spread the rectum to provide a clear\n\nview of the area.\"\n\n            On April 20, 1999, Craig Roberts (\"Roberts\") was a\n\npassenger in a car stopped by the police for expired registration\n\nstickers.    A check of police computers revealed that Roberts was\n\nthe subject of an \"outstanding body attachment,\" a type of writ\n\nissued by a magistrate in Rhode Island family court.    The police\n\nfrisked Roberts, but found no weapons or contraband.       Although\n\nRoberts produced a carbon-copy of a family court order withdrawing\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      A \"strip search\" is a visual inspection of an inmate's\nnaked body. A \"visual body cavity search\" is a strip search that\nincludes the visual inspection of an inmate's anal and genital\nareas. See Blackburn v. Snow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457687\"><a href=\"/opinion/457687/ruth-blackburn-v-linwood-snow/\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 561 n.3 (1st Cir.\n1985).\n\n                                -3-\n\fthe body attachment, the police arrested Roberts and took him to\n\nACI.\n\n              Upon arriving at ACI, Roberts was subjected to a strip\n\nand visual body cavity search pursuant to the written policies\n\ndescribed above.      No weapons or contraband were found.            After the\n\nsearch, Roberts was placed in a segregated cell.               Later that day,\n\nRoberts was subjected to another strip and visual body cavity\n\nsearch   in    preparation       for   his   transportation    to   the   Garrahy\n\nJudicial Complex.          Again, no weapons or contraband were found.\n\nAfter arriving at the complex, Roberts' carbon-copy of the order\n\nwithdrawing the body attachment was shown to a sheriff and Roberts\n\nwas released.\n\n              In 1999, Roberts brought a complaint in the district\n\ncourt alleging that the strip and visual body cavity searches\n\nrequired by Rhode Island's written policies violated his Fourth\n\nAmendment right to be free from unreasonable searches. Upon cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment, the district court ruled that the\n\nsearches were unconstitutional and issued an order enjoining Rhode\n\nIsland from conducting searches in accordance with those written\n\npolicies.

Like\n\nRoberts, the new plaintiffs all claimed they were arrested for non-\n\nviolent, non-drug related minor offenses and subjected to strip and\n\nvisual body cavity searches at ACI prior to March 17, 2000.           By way\n\nof example, one of the new plaintiffs, George Barber, loaned his\n\ncar to his son in 1993 and the son received a traffic ticket that\n\nwas never paid.    Six years later, Barber was arrested because of\n\nthe unpaid ticket, held at ACI overnight and strip searched twice.\n\nAnother plaintiff, Stephanie Clark, called police for assistance\n\nafter an auto accident and was arrested because a computer check\n\nshowed an outstanding arrest warrant for her failure to appear at\n\na probation review.    Clark had already finished her probation and\n\nthe warrant was issued in error.            She was taken to ACI and strip\n\nsearched twice.\n\n           Upon the defendants' motion, the district court dismissed\n\nRoberts'   claim   based   on   the    doctrine    of   res   judicata.    The\n\ndefendants then moved for summary judgment as to the remaining\n\nplaintiffs.   The district court granted the motion on the ground\n\nthat qualified immunity shielded the defendants from damages.\n\nAccording to the district court, the defendants were entitled to\n\nqualified immunity because it was not the \"clearly established\" law\n\nin this circuit that prison officials needed at least reasonable\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fsuspicion that arrestees for minor offenses were carrying weapons\n\nor contraband before conducting strip and visual body cavity\n\nsearches.\n\nII.

The purpose of this step is \"to\n\nensure that before they are subjected to suit, officers are on\n\nnotice their conduct is unlawful.\"     Saucier, 533 U.S. at 206.     This\n\nmeans that in the present case we must determine whether it was the\n\nclearly established law that prison officials needed at least\n\nreasonable suspicion before subjecting the plaintiffs to strip and\n\nvisual body cavity searches.\n\n           The district court held that the law was not clearly\n\nestablished.    In doing so, the district court based its decision\n\nlargely on our statement in Roberts' earlier appeal that \"[t]he\n\ninstitutional   security   concerns    in   play   here   fall   somewhere\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fbetween\"   other   cases   that    have    been   decided    by    this   court.\n\nRoberts, 239 F.3d at 111.         The district court concluded from our\n\nstatement that the unlawfulness of the ACI strip search policy\n\ncould not have been apparent to the defendants.                   After careful\n\nexamination, we think the district court assigned too much meaning\n\nto our statement.    The statement simply recognizes that the facts\n\ninvolved in this case are different than those of previous cases.\n\nThe Supreme Court recently explained in Hope v.

Specifically, the district court said that cases from other\n\ncircuits \"do not involve institutions designed like the ACI, where\n\npretrial   detainees   are    mixed        in   with   the   general      prison\n\npopulation.\"   To support its conclusion, the district court relied\n\non reasoning from the Eleventh Circuit, which had developed a line\n\nof decisions that found the law \"clearly established\" only when the\n\nfacts of previous cases were materially similar to the present\n\ncase.

See 122 S. Ct. at\n\n2515.     The Supreme Court said that considering only those cases\n\nwith similar facts, as the district court did here, is a \"rigid\n\ngloss on the qualified immunity standard . . .

The Court further stated that\n\n\"[a]lthough earlier cases involving 'fundamentally similar' facts\n\ncan provide especially strong support for a conclusion that the law\n\nis clearly established, they are not necessary to such a finding.\"\n\nId.

See Singh v.\n\nBlue Cross/Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200100\"><a href=\"/opinion/200100/singh-v-blue-cross/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (\"[Q]ualified immunity analysis under § 1983 involves a\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fquintessential legal question:     whether the rights at issue are\n\nclearly established.\"). We instead proceed on our own to determine\n\nwhether our cases, as well as those from other circuits, clearly\n\nestablished that reasonable suspicion was needed before prison\n\nofficials could subject people arrested for minor offenses to strip\n\nand visual body cavity searches.\n\n          We begin by noting that our inquiry is time-sensitive.\n\nSee Hatch, 274 F.3d at 22.    Qualified immunity is available to the\n\ndefendants if, at the time of the alleged violations, the law was\n\nnot clearly established.     See id.    The parties all agree that the\n\noperative date for our analysis is March 17, 2000.\n\n          \"One tried and true way of determining whether [a] right\n\nwas clearly established . . . is to ask whether existing case law\n\ngave the defendants fair warning that their conduct violated the\n\nplaintiff's constitutional rights.\"      Suboh, 298 F.3d at 93.   After\n\nthoroughly reviewing the law, we find that existing cases gave the\n\ndefendants plenty of fair warning that, prior to March 17, 2000,\n\nreasonable suspicion was needed in order to subject people arrested\n\nfor minor offenses to strip and visual body cavity searches.\n\n          The place to start our analysis is with the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Bell v. Wolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979).      In that\n\ncase, the Court upheld a strip and visual body cavity search of\n\npretrial detainees.   In doing so, the Court conducted an analysis\n\nthat balanced the need for the searches against the invasion of\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fpersonal rights.     Id. at 559.      Although the Court said that the\n\npractice of strip searching individuals \"instinctively gives us the\n\nmost pause,\" it found the searches constitutional because of the\n\nsecurity needs of the prison.        Id. at 559-60.       But the Court was\n\nclear to delineate the scope of its holding:\n\n            [W]e deal here with the question whether\n            visual body-cavity inspections . . . can ever\n            be conducted on less than probable cause.\n            Balancing the significant and legitimate\n            security interests of the institution against\n            the privacy interests of the inmates, we\n            conclude that they can.\n\nId.   at   560   (emphasis   in   original).       In    other   words,   Bell\n\nestablished the ceiling; it made clear that prison officials did\n\nnot necessarily need probable cause to strip search pretrial\n\ndetainees. But Bell left the floor undefined. Still ambiguous was\n\nwhether    prison   officials     needed   any   level   of   particularized\n\nsuspicion that detainees were carrying contraband or weapons before\n\nconducting strip searches.\n\n            Our early cases applying Bell to the prison environment\n\ndealt largely with situations involving prison visitors.

In short, the defendants had more than fair warning\n\nthat, prior to March 17, 2000, prison officials needed reasonable\n\nsuspicion that arrestees for minor offenses, like the plaintiffs in\n\nthis case, were concealing contraband or weapons before conducting\n\nstrip and visual body cavity searches.\n\n             The defendants' principal argument is that, despite the\n\noverwhelming     precedent   described          above,    it    was   still   unclear\n\nwhether reasonable suspicion was required when arrestees were\n\ncommingled with a general prison population, as was the case at the\n\nACI facilities.\n\n             Admittedly, our precedent does not speak to commingling\n\nspecifically.       But as early as Blackburn, we rejected the argument\n\nthat \"the security needs of a prison can, standing alone, properly\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fjustify the 'complete withdrawal' of Fourth Amendment rights from\n\nall who enter [a prison].\"       771 F.2d at 563 (emphasis in original);\n\nsee also Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013 (\"An indiscriminate strip search\n\npolicy    routinely    applied     to       detainees    .   .    .   cannot    be\n\nconstitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative\n\nease in attending to security considerations.\").\n\n             Cases from other circuits are more explicit; they refute\n\nthe defendants' argument with such clarity that we have little\n\ntrouble   concluding    that,    when       read   in   conjunction    with     our\n\nopinions, the defendants had fair warning that commingling alone\n\ncould not justify suspicionless strip searches of arrestees.                   Most\n\nnotable is the Sixth Circuit's holding in Masters v.

The Second Circuit in Walsh v. Franco, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69\n\n(2d   Cir.   1988),   ruled   that      a    blanket    strip    search   of   all\n\nmisdemeanor arrestees was not permissible simply because those\n\narrestees were commingled among arraigned inmates.                    The court\n\nexplained that \"the risk of a misdemeanor arrestee's introducing\n\n                                     -15-\n\fcontraband into the general jail population simply did not warrant\n\na strip search of all arrestees and that particularized suspicion\n\nis    required     for   strip-searching         any   person    arrested     for    a\n\nmisdemeanor or other minor offense.\"               Id.\n\n               The Ninth Circuit in Giles v. Ackerman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"443066\"><a href=\"/opinion/443066/julie-ann-giles-v-richard-dick-j-ackerman-sheriff-of-bonneville-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 618\n\n(9th Cir. 1984), adopted similar logic.                The court explained that\n\nblanket strip search policies cannot deter arrestees from smuggling\n\ncontraband into a jail because arrests are unplanned events.                        Id.\n\nThe    court    concluded   \"that      defendants'       heavy   reliance   on      the\n\nintermingling of its temporary detainees with the general [jail]\n\npopulation is misplaced because such intermingling is both limited\n\nand avoidable.\"      Id. at 619 (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted) (alteration in original).               The Tenth Circuit has held to\n\nthe same effect.         See Chapman, 989 F.2d at 396 (rejecting the\n\ndefendant's argument \"that the invasion posed by his policy is\n\njustified by the need for jail security because women detainees\n\nmust    be     incarcerated       in   one      cell   with   the   general      jail\n\npopulation\");      Hill,    735    F.2d    at    394   (rejecting   intermingling\n\nargument because \"intermingling is only one factor to consider in\n\njudging the constitutionality of a strip search\").\n\n               The defendants' final argument is that our decision in\n\nArruda v. Fair, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"420906\"><a href=\"/opinion/420906/paulo-arruda-v-michael-v-fair-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1983), made the law unclear\n\nregarding the need for reasonable suspicion when strip searching\n\narrestees who would ultimately be commingled with other inmates in\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fa maximum security prison.       In Arruda, we upheld a policy of strip\n\nsearching inmates at MCI-Walpole, a Massachusetts maximum security\n\nprison.   See id. at 888.     Nowhere in that opinion did we articulate\n\na need for reasonable suspicion.           The defendants say that ACI is a\n\nmaximum security prison too, and therefore Arruda suggests that no\n\nreasonable suspicion is needed to conduct strip and visual body\n\ncavity searches of arrestees brought to ACI.                 This argument is\n\nunpersuasive for two reasons. First, as we have already discussed,\n\nour cases since Arruda have made clear that reasonable suspicion is\n\nrequired to strip search arrestees.             See Swain, 117 F.3d at 7.\n\nSecond,   Arruda    was   a   case    involving      \"particularly    dangerous\n\nprisoners.\"     710 F.2d at 887.             The plaintiff himself was a\n\nconvicted   felon    assigned    to    a   special    cell   block,       which   we\n\ndescribed as a \"prison within a prison, designed to hold the most\n\ndangerous inmates.\"       Id.        The plaintiff was assigned to this\n\nspecial cell block for assaulting another prisoner.              In addition,\n\nthe plaintiff testified that, while a prisoner, he possessed drugs\n\nand a weapon.      Id. at 888.\n\n            Based on these facts, we have no difficulty concluding\n\nthat the defendants could not rely on Arruda to justify their\n\nactions. It is simply not reasonable to equate people arrested for\n\nnon-violent, non-drug related minor offenses with a convicted felon\n\nwho,   while   incarcerated,     possessed      contraband    and     a    weapon,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fassaulted a fellow prisoner, and was confined to a special cell\n\nblock designed to hold dangerous inmates.\n\n           In light of our prior case law, as well as decisions from\n\nother circuits, we conclude that the defendants had fair warning\n\nthat subjecting arrestees for minor offenses to strip and visual\n\nbody   cavity    searches    without    any     reasonable   suspicion   was   a\n\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment, even though the arrestees were\n\ncommingled with other inmates. The law was clearly established for\n\npurposes of qualified immunity.\n\n3.   Objective Reasonableness\n\n           Having concluded that the law clearly established the\n\nplaintiffs' right to be free from suspicionless strip and visual\n\nbody cavity searches, we now address the third and final step in\n\nthe qualified immunity analysis.              The defendants are entitled to\n\nqualified immunity if objectively reasonable prison officials in\n\nthe defendants' position would believe that their conduct was\n\nlawful in light of clearly established law.            See Suboh, 298 F.3d at\n\n95; Swain, 117 F.3d at 9.        This is a legal question, but we have\n\nrepeatedly      recognized    that     \"[a]     determination   of   objective\n\nreasonableness 'will often require examination of the information\n\npossessed' by the defendant officials.\" Kelly v.

Reasonable suspicion can arise\n\nfrom a wide variety of circumstances, including \"the crime charged,\n\nthe   particular   characteristics   of   the   arrestee,   and/or   the\n\ncircumstances of the arrest.\"    Weber, 804 F.2d at 802; Giles, 746\n\nF.2d at 617; see also Roberts, 239 F.3d at 113 (stating that\n\nreasonable suspicion can be based on \"observations of a particular\n\ninmate during a less invasive pat-down frisk and clothing search,\n\nor based on contraband found during that search\").\n\n           The record before us, however, is barren of any facts\n\nregarding what the prison officials knew, or did not know, about\n\nthe plaintiffs.    The only facts we have are those from the parties'\n\npleadings and those facts contained in the decisions by this court\n\nand the district court in Roberts' first round of litigation.        The\n\nfacts developed there were based on a \"joint factual stipulation\"\n\nsubmitted by the parties to the district court.        The record now\n\nbefore us does not contain the joint factual stipulation.       Even if\n\nit did, the joint stipulation pertains only to Roberts.       As far as\n\nwe can tell, the parties have not stipulated to all the facts\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fregarding any of the other plaintiffs.              Given the state of the\n\nrecord, we must remand this case to the district court for a\n\ndetermination of the third step in the qualified immunity analysis,\n\nas well as the other issues in the litigation.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            The law was clearly established on March 17, 2000, that\n\npeople arrested for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses\n\ncould not be subjected to strip and visual body cavity searches\n\nabsent reasonable suspicion that they were concealing contraband or\n\nweapons, even when those arrestees were commingled with general\n\nprison   populations.        The     district    court's   decision    granting\n\nqualified    immunity   to     the    defendants-appellees     is     therefore\n\nREVERSED    and   the   case    is    REMANDED    for   further     proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.            Costs on appeal are awarded to\n\nplaintiffs-appellants.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\f</pre>",
