HPY, Inc.,  brought this  action under  42\n               \n\nU.S.C.    1983  against  three public  authorities in  Puerto\n\nRico, certain  of their  officials, and  John Does  1 through\n\n1,000.  The  agencies are the  Electric Power Authority,  the\n\nPuerto  Rico  Aqueduct  and  Sewer Authority  and  the  Rural\n\nHousing  Administration.  The heart of  the complaint was the\n\nfollowing allegation:\n\n            On  or  about 1985,  squatters, without\n          valid  title  or  authorization from  the\n          plaintiff started  massive land invasions\n          on   said    properties   [belonging   to\n          plaintiff].       The   squatters,   also\n          Defendants of [sic] this suit, encouraged\n          and  abetted  by  the  other  Defendants,\n          proceeded  to  construct or  build shacks\n          and houses on Plaintiff's properties.\n\nThis, said the complaint, comprised a deprivation of property\n\nrights \"without due process and without due compensation.\"\n\n     The  defendants  moved  to  dismiss  the  complaint  for\n\nfailure  to state  a claim.   Fed. R.  Civ. P.  12(b)(6).  In\n\nopposing  the   motion,  HPY  offered  a   few  more  factual\n\nallegations.   Specifically, it  alleged  that squatters  had\n\noccupied  its  land  and  that  some  or  all  of  the  named\n\ndefendants  had  encouraged  the  invasion  and  abetted  the\n\nsquatters by  supplying public  facilities like power  to the\n\nsquatters and even constructing or assisting the squatters to\n\nconstruct  shacks.  The  district court  ultimately dismissed\n\nthe complaint, with prejudice, for failure to state  a claim,\n\nobserving  that \"we  are as  likely to  squeeze blood  from a\n\n                             -2-\n\nstone as we are to squeeze any more facts from this complaint\n\n. . . .\"   HPY appeals.1\n\n     We affirm  the district court.   Section 1983  creates a\n\nclaim for injuries done by anyone who \"acting under color of\"\n\nstate law deprives the victim  of any \"rights, privileges, or\n\nimmunities\" protected  under the Constitution.   The original\n\ncomplaint did not  explain what the named defendants had done\n\nunder  color of state law, but we  will take the complaint on\n\nthis  appeal  as  illuminated  by HPY's  oppositions  to  the\n\nmotions to dismiss.   Even in this posture, and  allowing HPY\n\nthe  benefits of liberal  pleading rules, 5  Wright &amp; Miller,\n\nFederal Practice and  Procedure   1219 (1990),  we cannot see\n                               \n\nhow HPY can premise a claim under section 1983 upon the facts\n\nalleged.  \n\n     We  will assume  arguendo  that the  color of  state law\n                              \n\nrequirement is met as to the named defendants (since they are\n\ngovernmental entities and officials) and that HPY's  property\n\nhas been physically occupied  and its value diminished.   But\n\nif  the actions of the named defendants are not authorized by\n\nlocal  law or  regulation,  then there  is no  constitutional\n                                                             \n\nviolation  so  long as  local law  affords  a remedy  for any\n\ntortious  misconduct.

One motion  amended a  page reference\nincluded  in   its  brief;   the  second  provided   us  with\nsupplemental  support  for  its  argument.    We  grant  both\nmotions.\n\n                             -3-\n\n(1984) (unauthorized property seizure of  state employees not\n\na constitutional  deprivation  if state  remedy  afforded).  \n\nDefendants  assert that there is a remedy under local law, 32\n\nL.P.R.A.    3077.  HPY neither alleged  the absence of such a\n\nremedy in the complaint  nor countered defendants'  assertion\n\nin this court (HPY did not file a reply brief).\n\n     Alternatively, if  HPY is alleging that  the abetting of\n\nthe trespass is authorized by Puerto Rican law, conceivably a\n\ntaking claim  would arise and the  Constitution would require\n\ncompensation.     But  again  there   is  no   constitutional\n\ndeprivation so  long as  Puerto Rico provides  an appropriate\n\nremedy  to  secure  compensation  for  takings.

Here, however, HPY filed an\n\nutterly uninformative complaint.  We have effectively treated\n\nthe  additional material scattered  in its  three oppositions\n\nfiled  in the district court as  amendments to the complaint.\n\nEven so,  HPY has still failed  to state a claim,  nor has it\n\n                             -4-\n\nfiled a reply  in this  court responding  to the  authorities\n\njust  recited (which were set forth in the answering briefs).\n\nAccordingly,  we  do  not   think  that  the  dismissal  with\n\nprejudice represents an abuse of discretion.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -5-\n",
