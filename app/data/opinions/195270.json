Hart,\n                                                              \nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief pro se.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n     Per  Curiam.   In 1991,  defendant Ellerton  Whitney was\n                \n\nconvicted on four  counts of defrauding a bank,  in violation\n\nof  18 U.S.C.   1344,  and on seventeen  additional counts of\n\nmaking   false  statements  on  bank  loan  applications,  in\n\nviolation of  18 U.S.C.   1014.  He received a prison term of\n\nthirty-six months.   On  appeal, we affirmed  his convictions\n\nbut remanded  for resentencing because of  an acknowledged ex\n                                                             \n\npost  facto violation  in the  application of  the sentencing\n           \n\nguidelines.  United States v. Whitney, 991 F.2d 786 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1993)  (per  curiam)  (table).    Defendant  was   thereafter\n\nresentenced  to a  prison term  of  twenty-seven months.   He\n\nagain  appeals (this time on a pro se basis),1 advancing some\n\nfourteen challenges  to his  new sentence and  his underlying\n\nconvictions.  With one  minor exception, we find each  of his\n\narguments unpersuasive.\n\n        I.  Issues Barred on \"Law of the Case\" Grounds\n                                                      \n\n     The  first six  issues  proffered by  defendant  involve\n\nsubstantive challenges  to his convictions.   These reduce to\n\nthree  separate allegations:  (1) that  his absence  from the\n\n\"charge conference\"  requires a new trial;  (2) that numerous\n\ncounts in  the indictment  were multiplicitous; and  (3) that\n\n                    \n\n1.  At  trial, defendant  chose to  conduct his  own defense,\nwith  counsel appearing on a  standby basis.   He handed over\nthe reins to his counsel for purposes of the first sentencing\nproceeding and  the first  appeal.  Similarly,  defendant was\nrepresented  by   counsel  at  the   resentencing  proceeding\n(although he was there afforded wide latitude to argue on his\nown behalf).  He has now again opted for pro se status. \n\n                             -2-\n\nthe evidence at trial  revealed allegedly fraudulent loans at\n\nvariance with those charged in the indictment.  We decline to\n\nconsider  each of these allegations under the law of the case\n\ndoctrine.  \n\n     In  the earlier  appeal, the  multiplicity  and variance\n\nissues were specifically raised  and specifically rejected by\n\nthis  court.   As we  explained in  United States  v. Rivera-\n                                                             \n\nMartinez,  931 F.2d 148, 150 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S.\n                                                     \n\nCt. 184 (1991),  \"a decision  of an appellate  tribunal on  a\n\nparticular issue,  unless vacated  or set aside,  governs the\n\nissue during all  subsequent stages of the litigation  in the\n\nnisi  prius court,  and  thereafter on  any further  appeal.\"\n\nDefendant has pointed to  no \"exceptional circumstances,\" id.\n                                                             \n\nat 151, that would  warrant disregarding this rule here.   In\n\nturn, the  \"charge conference\" issue, although  not raised in\n\nthe earlier appeal, is subject to the same disposition. \n\n     [A]  legal decision made at one stage of a civil or\n     criminal  case, unchallenged in a subsequent appeal\n     despite  the existence  of ample opportunity  to do\n     so, becomes the  law of the case  for future stages\n     of the same litigation,  and the aggrieved party is\n     deemed to  have  forfeited any  right to  challenge\n     that particular decision at a subsequent date.\n\nUnited States v.  Bell, 988  F.2d 247, 250  (1st Cir.  1993);\n                      \n\naccord, e.g., United States v. Connell, 6 F.3d 27, 30-31 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir. 1993). Again, no exceptionalcircumstances are apparent.2\n\n                    \n\n2.  Defendant's  standby counsel  did attend  the conference.\nThe  court noted for the record that defendant \"was expressly\ninvited to participate  in that conference but elected not to\n\n                             -3-\n\n     The district court properly confined  the proceedings on\n\nremand  to the  scope of  our  mandate.   Defendant's present\n\nattempt to \"take serial bites at the appellate apple,\" id. at\n                                                          \n\n30, must necessarily fail.3\n\n                   II.  Calculation of Loss\n                                           \n\n     By  aggregating  the total  amount  of  funds loaned  to\n\ndefendant, the  presentence report calculated that  the three\n\nbanks in question sustained losses  in excess of $2  million.\n\nDefendant's  attorney  disputed  this  finding  below on  the\n\nground  that  it  failed  to  account for  some  $500,000  in\n\ncollateral  which had  been  recovered.   The district  court\n\nsustained this  objection and  determined that the  losses in\n\nquestion, for  purposes of  U.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b),  exceeded $1\n\nmillion but were less than $2 million.4  \n\n                    \n\ndo  so.\"   And  defendant voiced  no  objection below  to his\nabsence.  \n\n3.  Defendant's attempt  to revive his multiplicity  claim in\nthe   guise  of   a  sentencing  issue--by   challenging  the\nimposition of $1050 in special  assessments--is inventive but\nunavailing.  The only sentencing calculation involved therein\nwas  the multiplication  of $50  by the  number of  counts on\nwhich he was convicted (21).  \n\n4.  This yielded a 9-level addition to the base offense level\nof  6.   After  adding  two  levels  for  more  than  minimal\nplanning, see    2F1.1(b)(2), and declining to add two levels\n             \nfor obstruction of  justice, the court arrived  at an offense\nlevel  of 17.    With  a  criminal  history  category  of  I,\ndefendant  was therefore subject to a  sentencing range of 24\nto 30 months.  The court selected a prison term in the middle\nof this range.  \n\n                             -4-\n\n     Defendant  advances  two  challenges  to  this  finding.\n\nFirst, in  a reprise  of his variance  argument, he  contends\n\nthat  the  three loans  charged  in  the indictment  actually\n\nconsisted  of   some  seven  or  more,  and   that  the  jury\n\npermissibly  could  have  convicted  him on  only  a  portion\n\nthereof (totalling less than $1,000,000).  This argument need\n\nnot  be pursued  at  any length.    To the  extent  defendant\n\nalleges  improper  variance   or  seeks   to  challenge   the\n\nevidentiary sufficiency  of  his convictions,  we decline  to\n\naddress such contentions  for the  reasons just  cited.   The\n\nguidelines state  that, for  purposes of    2F1.1(b)(1), \"the\n\nloss  need not  be determined  with precision.\"   U.S.S.G.   \n\n2F1.1,   comment.   (n.8).     Especially   considering  that\n\nadditional losses  resulted from  uncharged conduct  that was\n\npart  of a  common  scheme  or  plan,  and  so  was  properly\n\nadmissible in  this context,  see U.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a)(2), we\n                                 \n\nfind no error in the court's determination. \n\n     Second, defendant  contends that  he should not  be held\n\naccountable  for  the  full  extent  of  the  banks'  losses,\n\ninasmuch as other factors--such as dereliction on the part of\n\nbanking personnel--contributed  thereto.  Yet the  loss table\n\nin   2F1.1 \"presumes that the defendant alone is  responsible\n\nfor  the  entire  amount  of victim  loss  specified  in  the\n\nparticular  loss range  selected  by the  sentencing  court.\"\n\nUnited States v. Gregorio, 956 F.2d 341, 347 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                         \n\n                             -5-\n\nTo  the extent that such  amount is thought  to overstate the\n\nseriousness of a defendant's offense for reasons of \"multiple\n\ncausation,\" the  appropriate remedy is  for the court  in its\n\ndiscretion to effect a downward departure.  See, e.g., United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Brandon,     F.3d    , No. 92-1447, slip op. at 111\n                 \n\nn.83  (1st   Cir.  1994)  (\"The  Guidelines   treat  multiple\n\ncausation only as a possible ground for downward departure --\n\na  matter  within  the  sound discretion  of  the  sentencing\n\ncourt.\"); United States v. Johnson,     F.3d    ,     n.7 (3d\n                                  \n\nCir. 1994); United  States v. Shattuck,  961 F.2d 1012,  1017\n                                      \n\n(1st Cir. 1992); Gregorio, 956 F.2d at 347; U.S.S.G.   2F1.1,\n                         \n\ncomment. (n.11) (1988); id., comment. (n.7(b)) (1992).\n                           \n\n     The  court  here declined  to  depart  downward on  this\n\nbasis.   It is apparent (and defendant does not dispute) that\n\nthe court so decided  as a matter of discretion,  rather than\n\nout of any mistaken perception that it lacked the power to do\n\nso.  Its decision in this regard is therefore not appealable.\n\nSee,  e.g., United States v. McAndrews, 12 F.3d 273, 276 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir. 1993); United  States v. Soltero-Lopez,  11 F.3d 18,  20\n                                           \n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n       III.  Other Issues Concerning Refusal to Depart\n                                                      \n\n     In a series of arguments imbued with a distinct \"kitchen\n\nsink\"  quality,  defendant argues  that  the  court erred  in\n\nfailing to depart downward on account of his  age, education,\n\nvocational  skills,  employment, family  and  community ties,\n\n                             -6-\n\nrehabilitation and poverty.   No extended discussion of these\n\npoints  is necessary.  Under  U.S.S.G.   5H1,  the first five\n\nfactors are \"not ordinarily relevant\" in determining  whether\n\na downward departure is warranted.  See, e.g., United  States\n                                                             \n\nv.  Rivera, 994  F.2d 942,  948 (1st  Cir. 1993)  (discussing\n          \n\n\"discouraged  departures\").    Defendant  suggests  that  the\n\ndistrict court thought itself precluded from even considering\n\na  departure on these grounds.  To  the contrary, it is clear\n\nthat the  court simply concluded  that such factors  were not\n\n\"present in a manner that is unusual or special.\"  Id.  As to\n                                                      \n\nthe latter two  factors, we  need not decide  the extent,  if\n\nany,  to  which they  might provide  a  basis for  a downward\n\ndeparture.  Here as well, it is apparent that the court found\n\nthat a departure  was unwarranted as a  matter of discretion.\n\nAs  a result, each of defendant's arguments in this regard is\n\nlikewise  unappealable.   We  might  add  that defendant  has\n\npointed to  no personal circumstances that  would suggest his\n\ncase is in any way exceptional.5 \n\n                    \n\n5.  We likewise reject  two collateral arguments advanced  by\ndefendant in this regard.   First, he contends that  a remand\nfor resentencing  is necessary because of  the allegedly \"new\nrule\"   that  was  later  announced   in  Rivera.    Yet  the\n                                                \n\"modification\"  that we  there adopted  pertains only  to our\nstandard of review.  See 994 F.2d at 950-51. \n                        \n     Second, defendant argues that the policy statements in  \n5H1.1-.6 contravene  the statutory  directive in 28  U.S.C.  \n994(d) and are therefore invalid.  In particular, pointing to\n    994(d)'s   reference  to   \"establishing   categories  of\ndefendants,\" he suggests that this provision was not meant to\ndiscourage  reliance on  such  factors in  individual  cases.\nThis argument  not only  overlooks 28  U.S.C.   994(e),  see,\n                                                            \n\n                             -7-\n\n                       IV.  Restitution\n                                       \n\n     The district court ordered that defendant pay a total of\n\n$197,000  to the  three  banks in  question.   Defendant  now\n\nargues  that such  order was unsupported  by the  evidence on\n\nrecord, was unaccompanied by  requisite findings of fact, and\n\nwas barred by reason  of his indigency.  Except in  one minor\n\nrespect, we find no error.\n\n     In  determining  whether to  order  restitution  and the\n\namount thereof, a sentencing  court must \"consider the amount\n\nof  the loss  sustained  by any  victim  as a  result  of the\n\noffense,  the  financial  resources  of  the  defendant,  the\n\nfinancial needs and earning ability  of the defendant and the\n\ndefendant's dependents,  and such other factors  as the court\n\ndeems appropriate.\"  18 U.S.C.    3664(a).  Defendant's first\n\nargument,  which  apparently  contests the  district  court's\n\ncalculation  as to the \"amount of the loss,\" can be summarily\n\nrejected.   This  \"fact-intensive\" determination  is reviewed\n\n\"only  for clear error.\"   United States v.  Savoie, 985 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n612, 617 (1st Cir.  1993).  No such  error occurred here;  as\n\n                    \n\ne.g., United  States v.  Mondello, 927  F.2d 1463,  1470 (9th\n                                 \nCir. 1991)  (\"Commission's decision  to deem the  six factors\n'not ordinarily relevant' to departure determinations accords\nfully  with Congress' expression in  ...   994(e)  ... of the\n'general   inappropriateness'   of   considering    them   in\nsentencing\"),  but is otherwise  meritless, see, e.g., United\n                                                             \nStates v. Jones,     F.3d    , 1994 WL 61035, at *4 (4th Cir.\n               \n1994)  (\"the legislative mandate  [in   994(d)]  is clear and\nthe Commission has complied with that mandate\").  \n\n                             -8-\n\nmentioned above, the court  supportably found that the actual\n\nlosses were well in excess of $197,000.  \n\n     Our  decision in  Savoie  also disposes  of  defendant's\n                             \n\nsecond argument.   We there stated that  the sentencing judge\n\n\"need not  make open-court findings on  the statutory factors\n\nwhen issuing a  restitution order  so long as  the record  on\n\nappeal  reveals  that the  judge  made  implicit findings  or\n\notherwise  adequately  evinced  his  consideration  of  those\n\nfactors.\"  Id. at 618.   The record here makes clear that the\n              \n\ncourt  duly  considered the  statutory  factors.   They  were\n\nexamined at trial (over which the sentencing judge presided),\n\nwere discussed in detail in  the presentence report, and were\n\nthereafter  argued   at  some  length  at   the  resentencing\n\nhearing.6\n\n                    \n\n6.  In a  related argument,  defendant also complains  of the\ncourt's failure to provide reasons for its decision to impose\na prison term of twenty-seven months.  He relies on 18 U.S.C.\n    3553(c)(1),  which   provides  that,   if  (among   other\nconditions)  the  applicable  sentencing  range  \"exceeds  24\nmonths,\" the court must  explain its reasons \"for  imposing a\nsentence at a particular point within the range.\"  \n     Defendant  misinterprets this provision.   An expression\nof reasons is  required under   3553(c)(1)--not when the high\nend  of  the range  exceeds 24  months,  nor when  the actual\nsentence exceeds that duration--but rather when \"the width of\nthe guideline  range (i.e.,  the difference between  the high\nand  low  ends of  the range)\"  does  so.   United  States v.\n                                                          \nThomas,      F.3d    ,  1994 WL  67986, at  *9 n.2  (8th Cir.\n      \n1994) (en banc); accord,  e.g., United States v.  Upshaw, 918\n                                                        \nF.2d 789, 792  (9th Cir.  1990), cert. denied,  499 U.S.  930\n                                             \n(1991).    As the  applicable range  here  (24 to  30 months)\nspanned only six months,   3553(c)(1) is inapplicable.\n\n                             -9-\n\n     Defendant's third argument  is likewise unavailing.   As\n\nevidenced by    3664(a)'s reference to  \"earning ability,\" it\n\nhas been widely held that \"indigency is not a bar to an order\n\nof restitution.\"  United States v. Purther, 823 F.2d 965, 970\n                                          \n\n(6th Cir.  1987); accord, e.g.,  Brandon, supra, slip  op. at\n                                               \n\n116-17.    The  record  here  is  replete  with  evidence  of\n\ndefendant's professional accomplishments and business acumen;\n\nhe  himself  spoke  of  his \"entrepreneurial  enthusiasm\"  at\n\nresentencing.  Resent. Tr. at 18.  On  the basis thereof, the\n\ncourt  supportably  found  that  defendant's  future  earning\n\npotential was  sufficient to  warrant a substantial  order of\n\nrestitution--notwithstanding his current financial plight.7\n\n     Our  one disagreement  is with the  fact that  the court\n\nordered that  restitution be paid \"immediately.\"   Because it\n\nis  undisputed that  defendant is  presently indigent  and is\n\nthus unable to  comply with  such a directive,  we think  the\n\ncourt  inadvertently abused  its  discretion to  this limited\n\nextent.8  See, e.g.,  United States v. Ramilo, 986  F.2d 333,\n                                             \n\n                    \n\n7.  Pointing out that no restitution had  been imposed at his\ninitial  sentencing, defendant  also charges  that  the court\nacted  in  a vindictive  manner.    We  find this  contention\ngroundless.   It suffices to note that, whereas the court had\nordered  that  defendant  be  detained  pending  his  initial\nappeal, the court this  time around has released him  on bail\n(over the government's objection).\n\n8.  The district court can hardly  be faulted in this regard,\ninasmuch as  defendant  voiced no  such  objection  following\nentry  of the  restitution  order.   Defendant did,  however,\nadvert  to the point earlier  in his lengthy  allocution.  In\nturn, while he has not raised this matter directly on appeal,\n\n                             -10-\n\n335 (9th Cir. 1993) (restitution order \"must be based on some\n\nevidence  the defendant may be  able to pay  the amount fixed\n\nwhen  required to do so\");  United States v.

Sec. 1344, and on seventeen additional counts of making false statements on bank loan applications, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014.  He received a prison term of thirty-six months.  On appeal, we affirmed his convictions but remanded for resentencing because of an acknowledged ex post facto violation in the application of the sentencing guidelines.   United States v. Whitney, 991 F.2d 786 (1st Cir. 1993) (per curiam) (table).  Defendant was thereafter resentenced to a prison term of twenty-seven months.  He again appeals (this time on a pro se basis),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> advancing some fourteen challenges to his new sentence and his underlying convictions.  With one minor exception, we find each of his arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. Issues Barred on \"Law of the Case\" Grounds</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first six issues proffered by defendant involve substantive challenges to his convictions.  These reduce to three separate allegations:  (1) that his absence from the \"charge conference\" requires a new trial;  (2) that numerous counts in the indictment were multiplicitous;  and (3) that the evidence at trial revealed allegedly fraudulent loans at variance with those charged in the indictment.  We decline to consider each of these allegations under the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the earlier appeal, the multiplicity and variance issues were specifically raised and specifically rejected by this court.  As we explained in  United States v. Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d 148, 150 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 184 (1991), \"a decision of an appellate tribunal on a particular issue, unless vacated or set aside, governs the issue during all subsequent stages of the litigation in the nisi prius court, and thereafter on any further appeal.\"  Defendant has pointed to no \"exceptional circumstances,\" id. at 151, that would warrant disregarding this rule here.  In turn, the \"charge conference\" issue, although not raised in the earlier appeal, is subject to the same disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A] legal decision made at one stage of a civil or criminal case, unchallenged in a subsequent appeal despite the existence of ample opportunity to do so, becomes the law of the case for future stages of the same litigation, and the aggrieved party is deemed to have forfeited any right to challenge that particular decision at a subsequent date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Bell, 988 F.2d 247, 250 (1st Cir. 1993);   accord, e.g., United States v. Connell, 6 F.3d 27, 30-31 (1st Cir. 1993).  Again, no exceptional circumstances are apparent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court properly confined the proceedings on remand to the scope of our mandate.  Defendant's present attempt to \"take serial bites at the appellate apple,\"  id. at 30, must necessarily fail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Calculation of Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By aggregating the total amount of funds loaned to defendant, the presentence report calculated that the three banks in question sustained losses in excess of $2 million.  Defendant's attorney disputed this finding below on the ground that it failed to account for some $500,000 in collateral which had been recovered.  The district court sustained this objection and determined that the losses in question, for purposes of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b), exceeded $1 million but were less than $2 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant advances two challenges to this finding.  First, in a reprise of his variance argument, he contends that the three loans charged in the indictment actually consisted of some seven or more, and that the jury permissibly could have convicted him on only a portion thereof (totalling less than $1,000,000).  This argument need not be pursued at any length.  To the extent defendant alleges improper variance or seeks to challenge the evidentiary sufficiency of his convictions, we decline to address such contentions for the reasons just cited.  The guidelines state that, for purposes of Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1), \"the loss need not be determined with precision.\"  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, comment.  (n.8).  Especially considering that additional losses resulted from uncharged conduct that was part of a common scheme or plan, and so was properly admissible in this context, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2), we find no error in the court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, defendant contends that he should not be held accountable for the full extent of the banks' losses, inasmuch as other factors-such as dereliction on the part of banking personnel-contributed thereto.  Yet the loss table in Sec. 2F1.1 \"presumes that the defendant alone is responsible for the entire amount of victim loss specified in the particular loss range selected by the sentencing court.\"   United States v. Gregorio, 956 F.2d 341, 347 (1st Cir. 1992).  To the extent that such amount is thought to overstate the seriousness of a defendant's offense for reasons of \"multiple causation,\" the appropriate remedy is for the court in its discretion to effect a downward departure.  See, e.g., United States v. Brandon,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F.3d, No. 92-1447, slip op. at 111 n. 83 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"The Guidelines treat multiple causation only as a possible ground for downward departure-a matter within the sound discretion of the sentencing court.\");  United States v. Johnson,  F.3d, n. 7 (3d Cir. 1994);   United States v. Shattuck, 961 F.2d 1012, 1017 (1st Cir. 1992);   Gregorio, 956 F.2d at 347;  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, comment.  (n.11) (1988);  id., comment.  (n.7(b)) (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court here declined to depart downward on this basis.  It is apparent (and defendant does not dispute) that the court so decided as a matter of discretion, rather than out of any mistaken perception that it lacked the power to do so.  Its decision in this regard is therefore not appealable.   See, e.g., United States v. McAndrews, 12 F.3d 273, 276 (1st Cir. 1993);   United States v. Soltero-Lopez, 11 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>III. Other Issues Concerning Refusal to Depart</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a series of arguments imbued with a distinct \"kitchen sink\" quality, defendant argues that the court erred in failing to depart downward on account of his age, education, vocational skills, employment, family and community ties, rehabilitation and poverty.  No extended discussion of these points is necessary.  Under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5H1, the first five factors are \"not ordinarily relevant\" in determining whether a downward departure is warranted.  See, e.g., United States v. Rivera,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">994 F.2d 942, 948 (1st Cir. 1993) (discussing \"discouraged departures\").  Defendant suggests that the district court thought itself precluded from even considering a departure on these grounds.  To the contrary, it is clear that the court simply concluded that such factors were not \"present in a manner that is unusual or special.\"  Id. As to the latter two factors, we need not decide the extent, if any, to which they might provide a basis for a downward departure.  Here as well, it is apparent that the court found that a departure was unwarranted as a matter of discretion.  As a result, each of defendant's arguments in this regard is likewise unappealable.  We might add that defendant has pointed to no personal circumstances that would suggest his case is in any way exceptional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Restitution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ordered that defendant pay a total of $197,000 to the three banks in question.  Defendant now argues that such order was unsupported by the evidence on record, was unaccompanied by requisite findings of fact, and was barred by reason of his indigency.  Except in one minor respect, we find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether to order restitution and the amount thereof, a sentencing court must \"consider the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense, the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant's dependents, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3664(a).  Defendant's first argument, which apparently contests the district court's calculation as to the \"amount of the loss,\" can be summarily rejected.  This \"fact-intensive\" determination is reviewed \"only for clear error.\"   United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 617 (1st Cir. 1993).  No such error occurred here;  as mentioned above, the court supportably found that the actual losses were well in excess of $197,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision in Savoie also disposes of defendant's second argument.  We there stated that the sentencing judge \"need not make open-court findings on the statutory factors when issuing a restitution order so long as the record on appeal reveals that the judge made implicit findings or otherwise adequately evinced his consideration of those factors.\"   Id. at 618.  The record here makes clear that the court duly considered the statutory factors.  They were examined at trial (over which the sentencing judge presided), were discussed in detail in the presentence report, and were thereafter argued at some length at the resentencing hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's third argument is likewise unavailing.  As evidenced by Sec. 3664(a)' &#167; reference to \"earning ability,\" it has been widely held that \"indigency is not a bar to an order of restitution.\"   United States v. Purther, 823 F.2d 965, 970 (6th Cir. 1987);  accord, e.g., Brandon, supra, slip op. at 116-17.  The record here is replete with evidence of defendant's professional accomplishments and business acumen;  he himself spoke of his \"entrepreneurial enthusiasm\" at resentencing.  Resent.  Tr. at 18.  On the basis thereof, the court supportably found that defendant's future earning potential was sufficient to warrant a substantial order of restitution-notwithstanding his current financial plight.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our one disagreement is with the fact that the court ordered that restitution be paid \"immediately.\"  Because it is undisputed that defendant is presently indigent and is thus unable to comply with such a directive, we think the court inadvertently abused its discretion to this limited extent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>   See, e.g., United States v. Ramilo, 986 F.2d 333, 335 (9th Cir. 1993) (restitution order \"must be based on some evidence the defendant may be able to pay the amount fixed when required to do so\");  United States v. Clark, 901 F.2d 855, 857 (10th Cir. 1990) (vacating restitution order requiring immediate payment on this basis).  We therefore shall remand so that an appropriate payment schedule may be established.  The court at that time may also set a date for the resumption of defendant's service of his prison term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That part of the restitution order requiring immediate payment is vacated, the judgment is otherwise affirmed, and the case is remanded for the limited purpose of establishing an appropriate schedule for the payment of restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At trial, defendant chose to conduct his own defense, with counsel appearing on a standby basis.  He handed over the reins to his counsel for purposes of the first sentencing proceeding and the first appeal.  Similarly, defendant was represented by counsel at the resentencing proceeding (although he was there afforded wide latitude to argue on his own behalf).  He has now again opted for pro se status</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Defendant's standby counsel did attend the conference.  The court noted for the record that defendant \"was expressly invited to participate in that conference but elected not to do so.\"  And defendant voiced no objection below to his absence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Defendant's attempt to revive his multiplicity claim in the guise of a sentencing issue-by challenging the imposition of $1050 in special assessments-is inventive but unavailing.  The only sentencing calculation involved therein was the multiplication of $50 by the number of counts on which he was convicted (21)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This yielded a 9-level addition to the base offense level of 6. After adding two levels for more than minimal planning, see Sec. 2F1.1(b)(2), and declining to add two levels for obstruction of justice, the court arrived at an offense level of 17.  With a criminal history category of I, defendant was therefore subject to a sentencing range of 24 to 30 months.  The court selected a prison term in the middle of this range</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We likewise reject two collateral arguments advanced by defendant in this regard.  First, he contends that a remand for resentencing is necessary because of the allegedly \"new rule\" that was later announced in Rivera.  Yet the \"modification\" that we there adopted pertains only to our standard of review.  See 994 F.2d at 950-51</p>\n        <p>Second, defendant argues that the policy statements in Sec. 5H1.1-.6  contravene the statutory directive in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(d) and are therefore invalid.  In particular, pointing to Sec. 994(d)'s reference to \"establishing categories of defendants,\" he suggests that this provision was not meant to discourage reliance on such factors in individual cases.  This argument not only overlooks 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(e),  see, e.g., United States v. Mondello, 927 F.2d 1463, 1470 (9th Cir. 1991) (\"Commission's decision to deem the six factors 'not ordinarily relevant' to departure determinations accords fully with Congress' expression in ... Sec. 994(e) ... of the 'general inappropriateness' of considering them in sentencing\"), but is otherwise meritless, see, e.g., United States v. Jones,  F.3d, 1994 WL 61035, at * 4 (4th Cir. 1994) (\"the legislative mandate [in Sec. 994(d) ] is clear and the Commissionhas complied with that mandate\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In a related argument, defendant also complains of the court's failure to provide reasons for its decision to impose a prison term of twenty-seven months.  He relies on 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(c)(1), which provides that, if (among other conditions) the applicable sentencing range \"exceeds 24 months,\" the court must explain its reasons \"for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range.\"</p>\n        <p>Defendant misinterprets this provision.  An expression of reasons is required under Sec. 3553(c)(1)-not when the high end of the range exceeds 24 months, nor when the actual sentence exceeds that duration-but rather when \"the width of the guideline range (i.e., the difference between the high and low ends of the range)\" does so.  United States v. Thomas,  F.3d, 1994 WL 67986, at * 9 n. 2 (8th Cir. 1994) (en banc);   accord, e.g., United States v. Upshaw, 918 F.2d 789, 792 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 930 (1991).  As the applicable range here (24 to 30 months) spanned only six months, Sec. 3553(c)(1) is inapplicable.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Pointing out that no restitution had been imposed at his initial sentencing, defendant also charges that the court acted in a vindictive manner.  We find this contention groundless.  It suffices to note that, whereas the court had ordered that defendant be detained pending his initial appeal, the court this time around has released him on bail (over the government's objection)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The district court can hardly be faulted in this regard, inasmuch as defendant voiced no such objection following entry of the restitution order.  Defendant did, however, advert to the point earlier in his lengthy allocution.  In turn, while he has not raised this matter directly on appeal, defendant has made passing reference thereto in his brief.  Especially considering his pro se status, we deem the issue properly before us</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Shane Devine, U.S. District Judge ]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ellerton P. Whitney, III on brief pro se.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Peter S. Papps, United States Attorney, and Nancy E.

Sec. 1344, and on seventeen additional counts of making false statements on bank loan applications, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014.  He received a prison term of thirty-six months.  On appeal, we affirmed his convictions but remanded for resentencing because of an acknowledged ex post facto violation in the application of the sentencing guidelines.   United States v. Whitney, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></span> (1st Cir. 1993) (per curiam) (table).  Defendant was thereafter resentenced to a prison term of twenty-seven months.  He again appeals (this time on a pro se basis),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> advancing some fourteen challenges to his new sentence and his underlying convictions.  With one minor exception, we find each of his arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. Issues Barred on \"Law of the Case\" Grounds</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first six issues proffered by defendant involve substantive challenges to his convictions.  These reduce to three separate allegations:  (1) that his absence from the \"charge conference\" requires a new trial;  (2) that numerous counts in the indictment were multiplicitous;  and (3) that the evidence at trial revealed allegedly fraudulent loans at variance with those charged in the indictment.  We decline to consider each of these allegations under the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the earlier appeal, the multiplicity and variance issues were specifically raised and specifically rejected by this court.  As we explained in  United States v. Rivera-Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559873\"><a href=\"/opinion/559873/united-states-v-hector-rivera-martinez-aka-el-men/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 150 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></span> (1991), \"a decision of an appellate tribunal on a particular issue, unless vacated or set aside, governs the issue during all subsequent stages of the litigation in the nisi prius court, and thereafter on any further appeal.\"  Defendant has pointed to no \"exceptional circumstances,\" id. at 151, that would warrant disregarding this rule here.  In turn, the \"charge conference\" issue, although not raised in the earlier appeal, is subject to the same disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A] legal decision made at one stage of a civil or criminal case, unchallenged in a subsequent appeal despite the existence of ample opportunity to do so, becomes the law of the case for future stages of the same litigation, and the aggrieved party is deemed to have forfeited any right to challenge that particular decision at a subsequent date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Bell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602344\"><a href=\"/opinion/602344/united-states-v-richard-harmon-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span>, 250 (1st Cir. 1993);   accord, e.g., United States v. Connell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194971\"><a href=\"/opinion/194971/united-states-v-connell/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 30-31 (1st Cir. 1993).  Again, no exceptional circumstances are apparent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court properly confined the proceedings on remand to the scope of our mandate.  Defendant's present attempt to \"take serial bites at the appellate apple,\"  id. at 30, must necessarily fail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Calculation of Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By aggregating the total amount of funds loaned to defendant, the presentence report calculated that the three banks in question sustained losses in excess of $2 million.  Defendant's attorney disputed this finding below on the ground that it failed to account for some $500,000 in collateral which had been recovered.  The district court sustained this objection and determined that the losses in question, for purposes of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1(b), exceeded $1 million but were less than $2 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant advances two challenges to this finding.  First, in a reprise of his variance argument, he contends that the three loans charged in the indictment actually consisted of some seven or more, and that the jury permissibly could have convicted him on only a portion thereof (totalling less than $1,000,000).  This argument need not be pursued at any length.  To the extent defendant alleges improper variance or seeks to challenge the evidentiary sufficiency of his convictions, we decline to address such contentions for the reasons just cited.  The guidelines state that, for purposes of Sec. 2F1.1(b)(1), \"the loss need not be determined with precision.\"  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, comment.  (n.8).  Especially considering that additional losses resulted from uncharged conduct that was part of a common scheme or plan, and so was properly admissible in this context, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2), we find no error in the court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, defendant contends that he should not be held accountable for the full extent of the banks' losses, inasmuch as other factors-such as dereliction on the part of banking personnel-contributed thereto.  Yet the loss table in Sec. 2F1.1 \"presumes that the defendant alone is responsible for the entire amount of victim loss specified in the particular loss range selected by the sentencing court.\"   United States v. Gregorio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577673\"><a href=\"/opinion/577673/united-states-v-william-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 347 (1st Cir. 1992).  To the extent that such amount is thought to overstate the seriousness of a defendant's offense for reasons of \"multiple causation,\" the appropriate remedy is for the court in its discretion to effect a downward departure.  See, e.g., United States v. Brandon,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F.3d, No. 92-1447, slip op. at 111 n. 83 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"The Guidelines treat multiple causation only as a possible ground for downward departure-a matter within the sound discretion of the sentencing court.\");  United States v. Johnson,  F.3d, n. 7 (3d Cir. 1994);   United States v. Shattuck, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581517\"><a href=\"/opinion/581517/united-states-v-lewis-donald-shattuck/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1012</span></a></span>, 1017 (1st Cir. 1992);   Gregorio, 956 F.2d at 347;  U.S.S.G. Sec. 2F1.1, comment.  (n.11) (1988);  id., comment.  (n.7(b)) (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court here declined to depart downward on this basis.  It is apparent (and defendant does not dispute) that the court so decided as a matter of discretion, rather than out of any mistaken perception that it lacked the power to do so.  Its decision in this regard is therefore not appealable.   See, e.g., United States v. McAndrews, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195084\"><a href=\"/opinion/195084/united-states-v-mcandrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>, 276 (1st Cir. 1993);   United States v. Soltero-Lopez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195083\"><a href=\"/opinion/195083/united-states-v-soltero-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>III. Other Issues Concerning Refusal to Depart</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a series of arguments imbued with a distinct \"kitchen sink\" quality, defendant argues that the court erred in failing to depart downward on account of his age, education, vocational skills, employment, family and community ties, rehabilitation and poverty.  No extended discussion of these points is necessary.  Under U.S.S.G. Sec. 5H1, the first five factors are \"not ordinarily relevant\" in determining whether a downward departure is warranted.  See, e.g., United States v. Rivera,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>, 948 (1st Cir. 1993) (discussing \"discouraged departures\").  Defendant suggests that the district court thought itself precluded from even considering a departure on these grounds.  To the contrary, it is clear that the court simply concluded that such factors were not \"present in a manner that is unusual or special.\"  Id. As to the latter two factors, we need not decide the extent, if any, to which they might provide a basis for a downward departure.  Here as well, it is apparent that the court found that a departure was unwarranted as a matter of discretion.  As a result, each of defendant's arguments in this regard is likewise unappealable.  We might add that defendant has pointed to no personal circumstances that would suggest his case is in any way exceptional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Restitution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ordered that defendant pay a total of $197,000 to the three banks in question.  Defendant now argues that such order was unsupported by the evidence on record, was unaccompanied by requisite findings of fact, and was barred by reason of his indigency.  Except in one minor respect, we find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether to order restitution and the amount thereof, a sentencing court must \"consider the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense, the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant's dependents, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3664(a).  Defendant's first argument, which apparently contests the district court's calculation as to the \"amount of the loss,\" can be summarily rejected.  This \"fact-intensive\" determination is reviewed \"only for clear error.\"   United States v. Savoie, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600257\"><a href=\"/opinion/600257/united-states-v-paul-j-savoie/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 617 (1st Cir. 1993).  No such error occurred here;  as mentioned above, the court supportably found that the actual losses were well in excess of $197,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision in Savoie also disposes of defendant's second argument.  We there stated that the sentencing judge \"need not make open-court findings on the statutory factors when issuing a restitution order so long as the record on appeal reveals that the judge made implicit findings or otherwise adequately evinced his consideration of those factors.\"   Id. at 618.  The record here makes clear that the court duly considered the statutory factors.  They were examined at trial (over which the sentencing judge presided), were discussed in detail in the presentence report, and were thereafter argued at some length at the resentencing hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's third argument is likewise unavailing.  As evidenced by Sec. 3664(a)' &#167; reference to \"earning ability,\" it has been widely held that \"indigency is not a bar to an order of restitution.\"   United States v. Purther, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491511\"><a href=\"/opinion/491511/united-states-v-franklin-purther/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span>, 970 (6th Cir. 1987);  accord, e.g., Brandon, supra, slip op. at 116-17.  The record here is replete with evidence of defendant's professional accomplishments and business acumen;  he himself spoke of his \"entrepreneurial enthusiasm\" at resentencing.  Resent.  Tr. at 18.  On the basis thereof, the court supportably found that defendant's future earning potential was sufficient to warrant a substantial order of restitution-notwithstanding his current financial plight.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our one disagreement is with the fact that the court ordered that restitution be paid \"immediately.\"  Because it is undisputed that defendant is presently indigent and is thus unable to comply with such a directive, we think the court inadvertently abused its discretion to this limited extent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>   See, e.g., United States v. Ramilo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600471\"><a href=\"/opinion/600471/united-states-v-obet-lagumbay-ramilo/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span>, 335 (9th Cir. 1993) (restitution order \"must be based on some evidence the defendant may be able to pay the amount fixed when required to do so\");  United States v. Clark, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540122\"><a href=\"/opinion/540122/united-states-v-elda-m-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span>, 857 (10th Cir. 1990) (vacating restitution order requiring immediate payment on this basis).  We therefore shall remand so that an appropriate payment schedule may be established.  The court at that time may also set a date for the resumption of defendant's service of his prison term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That part of the restitution order requiring immediate payment is vacated, the judgment is otherwise affirmed, and the case is remanded for the limited purpose of establishing an appropriate schedule for the payment of restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At trial, defendant chose to conduct his own defense, with counsel appearing on a standby basis.  He handed over the reins to his counsel for purposes of the first sentencing proceeding and the first appeal.  Similarly, defendant was represented by counsel at the resentencing proceeding (although he was there afforded wide latitude to argue on his own behalf).  He has now again opted for pro se status</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Defendant's standby counsel did attend the conference.  The court noted for the record that defendant \"was expressly invited to participate in that conference but elected not to do so.\"  And defendant voiced no objection below to his absence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Defendant's attempt to revive his multiplicity claim in the guise of a sentencing issue-by challenging the imposition of $1050 in special assessments-is inventive but unavailing.  The only sentencing calculation involved therein was the multiplication of $50 by the number of counts on which he was convicted (21)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This yielded a 9-level addition to the base offense level of 6. After adding two levels for more than minimal planning, see Sec. 2F1.1(b)(2), and declining to add two levels for obstruction of justice, the court arrived at an offense level of 17.  With a criminal history category of I, defendant was therefore subject to a sentencing range of 24 to 30 months.  The court selected a prison term in the middle of this range</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We likewise reject two collateral arguments advanced by defendant in this regard.  First, he contends that a remand for resentencing is necessary because of the allegedly \"new rule\" that was later announced in Rivera.  Yet the \"modification\" that we there adopted pertains only to our standard of review.  See 994 F.2d at 950-51</p>\n        <p>Second, defendant argues that the policy statements in Sec. 5H1.1-.6  contravene the statutory directive in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(d) and are therefore invalid.  In particular, pointing to Sec. 994(d)'s reference to \"establishing categories of defendants,\" he suggests that this provision was not meant to discourage reliance on such factors in individual cases.  This argument not only overlooks 28 U.S.C. Sec. 994(e),  see, e.g., United States v. Mondello, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557348\"><a href=\"/opinion/557348/united-states-v-edward-x-mondello/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1463</span></a></span>, 1470 (9th Cir. 1991) (\"Commission's decision to deem the six factors 'not ordinarily relevant' to departure determinations accords fully with Congress' expression in ... Sec. 994(e) ... of the 'general inappropriateness' of considering them in sentencing\"), but is otherwise meritless, see, e.g., United States v. Jones,  F.3d, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">61035</span></span>, at * 4 (4th Cir. 1994) (\"the legislative mandate [in Sec. 994(d) ] is clear and the Commissionhas complied with that mandate\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In a related argument, defendant also complains of the court's failure to provide reasons for its decision to impose a prison term of twenty-seven months.  He relies on 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(c)(1), which provides that, if (among other conditions) the applicable sentencing range \"exceeds 24 months,\" the court must explain its reasons \"for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range.\"</p>\n        <p>Defendant misinterprets this provision.  An expression of reasons is required under Sec. 3553(c)(1)-not when the high end of the range exceeds 24 months, nor when the actual sentence exceeds that duration-but rather when \"the width of the guideline range (i.e., the difference between the high and low ends of the range)\" does so.  United States v. Thomas,  F.3d, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">67986</span></span>, at * 9 n. 2 (8th Cir. 1994) (en banc);   accord, e.g., United States v. Upshaw, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551346\"><a href=\"/opinion/551346/united-states-v-ralph-anthony-upshaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span>, 792 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span></span> (1991).  As the applicable range here (24 to 30 months) spanned only six months, Sec. 3553(c)(1) is inapplicable.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Pointing out that no restitution had been imposed at his initial sentencing, defendant also charges that the court acted in a vindictive manner.  We find this contention groundless.  It suffices to note that, whereas the court had ordered that defendant be detained pending his initial appeal, the court this time around has released him on bail (over the government's objection)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The district court can hardly be faulted in this regard, inasmuch as defendant voiced no such objection following entry of the restitution order.  Defendant did, however, advert to the point earlier in his lengthy allocution.  In turn, while he has not raised this matter directly on appeal, defendant has made passing reference thereto in his brief.  Especially considering his pro se status, we deem the issue properly before us</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
