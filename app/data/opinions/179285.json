Girón-Anadón were on brief,\nfor appellees Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation of the\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico and Miguel Pereira-Castillo.\n\n\n                        November 16, 2010\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.          Enrique Cortés-Rivera, a doctor,\n\nappeals from a grant of summary judgment entered by the district\n\ncourt on his claim that his contract to provide medical services\n\nwas illegally terminated.        Cortés-Rivera worked as an independent\n\ncontractor      in    Puerto   Rico's    Department       of    Corrections    and\n\nRehabilitation (DOCR) between 2002 and 2007.              He alleges that DOCR\n\nand its managing corporation, the Correctional Health Services\n\nCorporation (CHSC), discriminated and retaliated against him on the\n\nbasis of disability in violation of Title I of the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\n(§ 504), and Puerto Rico state law.\n\n            The district court treated Cortés-Rivera's pleading,\n\nstyled as a motion to oppose CHSC's summary judgment motion, as\n\nuntimely.    The main thrust of Cortés-Rivera's case was that he was\n\nan employee of CHSC and DOCR for purposes of his Title I and § 504\n\nclaims,   not    an   independent   contractor.           In    granting   summary\n\njudgment for CHSC and DOCR, the district court made three holdings:\n\n(1) Cortés-Rivera was not an employee of CHSC or DOCR for purposes\n\nof the ADA, (2) Cortés-Rivera neither objected to a magistrate\n\njudge's conclusion that his non-employee status precluded his\n\nreasonable      accommodation    claims       under   §   504    nor   adequately\n\npresented this issue to the district court, and (3) Cortés-Rivera\n\nhad failed to raise a federal retaliation claim.                    The district\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fcourt declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Cortés-\n\nRivera's state-law claims.      We affirm.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            A general practitioner, Cortés-Rivera began working for\n\nDOCR in 2002.   In a pair of service contracts entered that year, he\n\nagreed to provide emergency room and ambulatory services to the\n\nprison population at Guayama Correctional Facility.         Cortés-Rivera\n\nentered a superseding service contract on July 1, 2006.          In this\n\ncontract, set to expire on June 30, 2007, Cortés-Rivera agreed to\n\nprovide ambulatory services for DOCR.        In a letter dated November\n\n15, 2006, DOCR terminated this contract early, effective January 8,\n\n2007.   Cortés-Rivera entered a final service contract with DOCR on\n\nFebruary 20, 2007, which expired about four months later on June\n\n30, 2007.\n\n            During the course of these contracts, between January and\n\nMarch   2006,   Cortés-Rivera    was    diagnosed   with   Guillain-Barre\n\nsyndrome. Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder in\n\nwhich the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral\n\nnervous system.    It leads to varying degrees of physical weakness\n\nand, in some cases, paralysis.         There is no known cure for the\n\ndisorder, though therapies may lessen its severity and accelerate\n\nrecovery.   Cortés-Rivera's Guillian-Barre syndrome led to complete\n\nparalysis of his left leg and foot.          The parties do not contest\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fthat Cortés-Rivera qualifies as an individual with a disability\n\nwithin the meaning of federal disability laws.\n\n              Also during the course of Cortés-Rivera's contracts, DOCR\n\nentered into an agreement with another entity, CHSC, providing that\n\nCHSC would manage DOCR's Correctional Health Program.               Under the\n\nagreement, CHSC assumed full supervisory authority over employees\n\nand contractors of DOCR.        The contract provided that employees and\n\ncontractors of DOCR would remain such until their relationship with\n\nDOCR was either terminated or modified.               This contract entered\n\nforce in 2005 and remained in force through the expiration of\n\nCortés-Rivera's last service contract.\n\n              In a letter dated September 19, 2006, Cortés-Rivera\n\nrequested      accommodations     to    address   difficulties    he    had   in\n\naccessing punch clocks used to measure attendance and timeliness at\n\nthe correctional facility.        This request was denied in a September\n\n27,   2006,    letter    from   the    Clinical   Services   Director   of    the\n\nCorrectional Health Program.           The letter stated that Cortés-Rivera\n\nwas not a regular employee and thus did not have the privileges of\n\nsuch employees.         The letter nonetheless recommended that Cortés-\n\nRivera's supervisor consult with him about placing him in one of\n\ntwo particular areas of the facility that would be more accessible.\n\nCortés-Rivera was subsequently placed in one of those areas.\n\n              In a letter dated October 23, 2006, the chief executive\n\nofficer of CHSC notified the secretary of DOCR, Miguel Pereira-\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fCastillo, that layoffs would be necessary to address a projected\n\nbudget deficit for DOCR.     He requested that DOCR cancel six of its\n\nprofessional service contracts, including Cortés-Rivera's.             The\n\nofficer wrote that one of the professionals rendered services that\n\nwere no longer necessary.          He wrote that the remaining five\n\nprofessionals, including Cortés-Rivera, were selected because they\n\nhad the least seniority in the institution where they rendered\n\nservices.   On November 15, 2006, Pereira-Castillo notified Cortés-\n\nRivera that his contract would be terminated effective January 8,\n\n2007.   DOCR nonetheless entered a subsequent contract with Cortés-\n\nRivera on February 20, 2007, effective until June 30, 2007.\n\n            On November 20, 2007, Cortés-Rivera filed a complaint\n\nalleging    disability   discrimination    and   retaliation.     As   to\n\ndiscrimination, Cortés-Rivera claimed that the defendants denied\n\nhis   request   for   reasonable   accommodation   and    terminated   his\n\ncontract in violation of Title I of the ADA and § 504.             As to\n\nretaliation, he made two claims, asserting that they were made\n\nunder Puerto Rico state law.        First, he asserted that the early\n\ntermination of his July 31, 2006, contract was in retaliation for\n\nhis accommodation request. Second, he asserted that the defendants\n\nrefused to alter his February 20, 2007, contract because he filed\n\nclaims concerning the prior termination with the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity     Commission   (EEOC).      Cortés-Rivera    also   alleged\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdiscrimination and various common law claims in tort and contract\n\nunder Puerto Rico state law.\n\n            Adopting the recommendations of a magistrate judge, the\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment to the defendants.                           As a\n\npreliminary matter, the district court held that Cortés-Rivera did\n\nnot timely oppose CHSC's motion for summary judgment.                           On the\n\nmerits of the joint motion for summary judgment, the district court\n\nmade three holdings: (1) Cortés-Rivera was not an employee of DOCR\n\nor CHSC under Title I of the ADA, (2) Cortés-Rivera failed to\n\nobject to the magistrate's conclusion that his non-employee status\n\nbarred his reasonable accommodation claim under § 504 and failed to\n\nadequately contest the issue in the district court, and (3) Cortés-\n\nRivera did not raise a federal retaliation claim.                      The district\n\ncourt declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Cortés-\n\nRivera's state claims in the absence of a valid federal claim.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            On appeal, Cortés-Rivera challenges both the district\n\ncourt's finding that he did not timely oppose CHSC's summary\n\njudgment motion and the district court's three holdings on the\n\nmerits.         As    to   the   timeliness    of   his   opposition      to    summary\n\njudgment, he argues that the district court abused its discretion\n\ngiven     the        purported    seriousness       of    its   holding        and    the\n\nreasonableness of his reading of the deadline.                    As to the three\n\nclaims on the merits, Cortés-Rivera argues that (1) he is an\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\femployee of DOCR and CHSC for purposes of Title I of the ADA, (2)\n\nhe may bring an employment discrimination claim under § 504 even if\n\nhe does not qualify as an employee under Title I of the ADA, and\n\n(3) he raised federal retaliation claims for purposes of Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 8.\n\n            We first address Cortés-Rivera's claim concerning the\n\ntiming of his opposition to CHSC's summary judgment motion.                     We\n\nthen turn to his three claims on the merits of CHSC's and DOCR's\n\njoint motion for summary judgment.\n\nA.          Timeliness of Opposition to Summary Judgment\n\n            We review a district court's finding that a party failed\n\nto timely oppose summary judgment for abuse of discretion.                United\n\nStates v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 770 (1st Cir. 1995).                We will\n\nonly find an abuse of discretion if there is \"an unreasoning and\n\narbitrary    insistence   upon   expeditiousness        in   the   face    of    a\n\njustified request for delay.\"         Id. (quoting Morris v. Slappy, 461\n\nU.S. 1, 11-12 (1983)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Only in \"rare cases\" have we found that a district court\n\nabused its discretion in refusing to grant an extension of time.\n\nPerez-Cordero v. Wal-Mart Puerto Rico, 440 F.3d 531, 534 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   We have granted relief, however, when a litigant was\n\n\"reasonably surprised\" by a court's deadline or \"the events leading\n\nto the contested decision were unfair.\"           Id. (collecting cases).\n\nCortés-Rivera   claims    that   he    was   \"gravely    surprised\"   by     the\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\frelevant deadline and recites this court's observation in Perez-\n\nCordero that \"[i]n most cases, a party's failure to oppose summary\n\njudgment is fatal to its case,\" id.\n\n              Cortés-Rivera's claim of surprise by this deadline makes\n\nlittle sense.     He argues that the district court should have given\n\nhim an extension, though he did not seek one, because it previously\n\nextended a deadline for DOCR.       He also implies that he should have\n\nbeen awarded an extension so that he could oppose both CHSC's\n\nmotion for summary judgment and DOCR's motion for summary judgment\n\nat the same time.      As the district court held, \"[a]ssumptions can\n\nbe perilous, as they were here.\"         Cortes-Rivera v. Dep't of Corr.\n\n& Rehab. of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 617 F. Supp. 2d 7, 22\n\n(D.P.R. 2009).\n\n              Nor is there any substantive unfairness.             The claims\n\ncontained in CHSC's and DOCR's motions for summary judgment are\n\nnearly identical.         Cortés-Rivera does not purport to raise a\n\nmaterial fact on this appeal relevant to CHSC's motion but not\n\nDOCR's motion.      The only factual issue he argues is in dispute\n\nconcerns whether Cortés-Rivera was an employee of either CHSC or\n\nDOCR;   the    relevant   facts   are   essentially   the   same    for   both\n\ndefendants.      The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nfinding his filing was late.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fB.          Challenge to Grant of Summary Judgment\n\n            We review grants of summary judgment de novo, drawing all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.             Sullivan\n\nv. City of Springfield, 561 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir. 2009).              Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material\n\nfact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.   Foley v. Town of Randolph, 598 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2010).           We\n\nignore     \"conclusory      allegations,    improbable     inferences,    and\n\nunsupported speculation.\"          Sullivan, 561 F.3d at 14 (quoting\n\nPrescott v. Higgins, 538 F.3d 32, 39 (1st Cir. 2008)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n            1.      The Independent Contractor Issue\n\n            Cortés-Rivera's claim that the district court erred in\n\nconcluding that he was not an employee of DOCR or CHSC for purposes\n\nof Title I of the ADA warrants little discussion.             Cortés-Rivera\n\npresents    no   argument    to   support   this   claim   beyond   the   bald\n\nassertion that he raised a material fact as to his employment\n\nstatus before the district court.             Issues \"adverted to in a\n\nperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\"          United States v. Zannino, 895\n\nF.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).        We deem this issue waived.\n\n            2.      We Decline to Reach the § 504 Claim\n\n            Cortés-Rivera's second claim fails for much the same\n\nreason.     He argues that employment discrimination claims under\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f§ 504 are not limited by the definition of employee in Title I of\n\nthe ADA.    To address this claim would require that we interpret a\n\nprovision added to § 504 after Congress passed the ADA.                That\n\nprovision, 29 U.S.C. § 794(d), states that \"[t]he standards used to\n\ndetermine whether this section has been violated in a complaint\n\nalleging employment discrimination under this section shall be the\n\nstandards   applied   under   title   I   of   the   [ADA]\"   and   various\n\nmiscellaneous provisions of the ADA \"as such sections relate to\n\nemployment.\"\n\n            This court has not addressed whether 29 U.S.C. § 794(d)\n\nrequires that plaintiffs alleging employment discrimination under\n\n§ 504 meet the ADA's definition of employee.           The four circuits\n\nthat have considered this issue are split.           The Sixth and Eighth\n\ncircuits have held that 29 U.S.C. § 794(d) does require that\n\nplaintiffs alleging employment discrimination under § 504 meet the\n\nADA's definition of employee.    Wojewski v. Rapid City Reg'l Hosp.,\n\nInc., 450 F.3d 338, 345 (8th Cir. 2006); Hiler v. Brown, 177 F.3d\n\n542, 544-45 & n.5 (6th Cir. 1999).        The Ninth and Tenth circuits\n\nhave held that 29 U.S.C. § 794(d) only requires that plaintiffs\n\nalleging employment discrimination under § 504 meet the definitions\n\nof workplace discrimination set out in the ADA.          Fleming v. Yuma\n\nReg'l Med. Ctr., 587 F.3d 938, 941-46 (9th Cir. 2009), Schrader v.\n\nFred A. Ray M.D., P.C., 296 F.3d 968, 972-75 (10th Cir. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f               Noting    that   Cortés-Rivera       failed   to   object   to   the\n\nmagistrate judge's application of the Eighth Circuit's decision in\n\nWojewski,1 the district court declined to entertain the objection.\n\nIt also admonished Cortés-Rivera for his failure to present a clear\n\nlegal       argument    on   this   question   of   statutory     interpretation.\n\nNotwithstanding this, the district court said it agreed with the\n\nEighth Circuit's reasoning in Wojewski.\n\n               We decline to address the issue both because it was\n\nneither preserved nor adequately presented in the district court\n\nand because it is not adequately presented on appeal.                  Important\n\nissues of statutory interpretation require adequate briefing in all\n\nlevels of the federal court system, and here we have none.\n\n               In the district court, Cortés-Rivera neither adequately\n\nobjected to the magistrate judge's recommendation nor adequately\n\nbriefed the issue for the district court's consideration.                       The\n\nmagistrate judge faced a dispute over whether CHSC and DOCR were\n\nrecipients of federal financial assistance and therefore subject to\n\n\n\n        1\n          The district court made this conclusion explicit with\nrespect to Cortés-Rivera's objection to the magistrate judge's\nrecommendation regarding CHSC's motion for summary judgment. It\nwas not so explicit with respect to Cortés-Rivera's objection to\nthe magistrate judge's recommendation regarding DOCR's motion, but\nit held that Cortés-Rivera presented \"the same objection . . . with\nregard to the first report and recommendation\" concerning CHSC's\nmotion for summary judgment.     Cortés-Rivera's objection to the\nmagistrate judge's report concerning DOCR's motion was slightly\nmore developed than his objection to the report concerning CHSC's\nmotion, but it still did not raise a specific objection to the\nmagistrate judge's application of Wojewski.\n\n                                        -11-\n\f§ 504.   Rather than decide this issue, the magistrate judge stated\n\nthat even if CHSC and DOCR did receive federal funds, no § 504\n\nclaim was stated under the reasoning of Wojewski.     Cortés-Rivera\n\nmade no specific objection to this, as the district court noted.\n\nBeyond that, in his argument before the district court, Cortés-\n\nRivera only referenced Wojewski to argue that he was an employee,\n\nnot a contractor.     He made, at most, only a cursory and implicit\n\nargument that even if he was a contractor, Wojewski was wrongly\n\ndecided.\n\n           This is a double default. First, Cortés-Rivera's failure\n\nto object to the magistrate's interpretation constitutes waiver.\n\nSantiago v. Canon U.S.A., Inc., 138 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nGiven adequate notice, \"a party's failure to assert a specific\n\nobjection to a report and recommendation irretrievably waives any\n\nright to review by the district court and the court of appeals.\"\n\nId. Second, Cortés-Rivera failed to adequately brief the issue to\n\nthe district court.    See Castillo v. Matesanz, 348 F.3d 1, 12 (1st\n\nCir. 2003). That the district court stated that it viewed Wojewski\n\nas correct does not require that we exercise our discretion to\n\nforgive this double default.     See Gonzalez v. El Dia, Inc., 304\n\nF.3d 63, 74 n.9 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           Cortés-Rivera also has not adequately presented this\n\nclaim on appeal, so it is triply gone.   See F.T.C. v. Direct Mktg.\n\nConcepts, Inc., No. 09-2172, 2010 WL 4118643, at * 4 (1st Cir. Oct.\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f21, 2010).           We do not even know whether this case actually would\n\nrequire that we resolve this issue if we had adequate briefing.\n\nEven       if   it    did    so   require,   Cortés-Rivera     merely      seeks   to\n\ndistinguish Wojewski on its facts and states that § 504 does not\n\ninclude a definition of \"employee\" like the ADA.                     The statement\n\nthat § 504 does not include a definition of \"employee\" ignores the\n\nvery question purportedly raised in this appeal: whether 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 794(d) incorporates the definition of \"employee\" in the ADA.2\n\n                3.          Retaliation\n\n                Next, Cortés-Rivera argues that he raised a federal\n\nretaliation claim on the face of his complaint.                      Cortés-Rivera\n\ninvokes the liberal pleading requirements set out in Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 8 as well as this court's decision in Morales-Vallellanes v.\n\nPotter, 339 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 2003).                 The plaintiff in Morales-\n\nVallellanes alleged discrimination and retaliation but \"fail[ed] to\n\ncite any statutory basis for relief.\"                 Id. at 14.       The parties\n\ndisputed whether he had raised a Title VII claim in addition to a\n\nclaim under a collective bargaining agreement.                     Given \"both the\n\nsubstance       and     structure\"   of   the    complaint,   we    held   that    the\n\nplaintiff had pleaded both claims under Rule 8.                Id. at 15.\n\n\n\n       2\n          Cortés-Rivera's assertion about the absence of a\ndefinition of \"employee\" in § 504 as originally adopted gestures\ntoward an argument about the broader purpose of that provision and\nits relationship with the ADA. We decline, however, the invitation\nto \"make [Cortés-Rivera's] argument for him.\" Mulvihill v. Top-\nFlite Golf Co., 335 F.3d 15, 28 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                          -13-\n\f           The structure and substance of the complaint in this case\n\ndictate   a   different   conclusion.    Cortés-Rivera       divided   his\n\ncomplaint into several counts.      The first alleged discrimination\n\nunder Title I of the ADA.    The second alleged discrimination under\n\n§ 504.    The third, in question here, alleged acts committed \"with\n\nretaliatory animus, thus in violation to [sic] the Puerto Rico Laws\n\n115, and Law 426 of November 2000, and constitut[ing] a tort under\n\nthe Civil Code of Puerto Rico 31 L.P.R.A. section 1802, and the\n\nConstitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" Three additional\n\ncounts alleged various claims under Puerto Rico state law.\n\n           The plain language of Count Three states that Cortés-\n\nRivera's retaliation claims arose under state law, not federal law.\n\nIn Count Three, Cortés-Rivera only alleged violations of Puerto\n\nRico state law.    Count Three alleged retaliation resulting from\n\nCortés-Rivera's    choice   to   \"exercise[]   his   right    under    the\n\nAmerican[s] with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act to\n\nfile a complaint before the EEOC and for joining a civil action.\"\n\nThis language about the ADA and § 504, which also appears in\n\nsimilar terms in the background to the complaint, merely states a\n\nrationale for the retaliatory conduct Cortés-Rivera alleges.            It\n\ndoes not assert a legal basis for that claim.3\n\n\n     3\n          In Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter, 339 F.3d 9 (1st Cir.\n2003) we deemed it relevant that the complaint was \"replete with\nreferences to plaintiff's EEO initiatives.\" Id. at 15. Cortés-\nRivera notes that his complaint also contains references to the\nEEOC process. The complaint made the above claims about the source\n\n                                  -14-\n\f             The structure of the complaint reinforces Count Three's\n\nplain language.     Each count of the complaint clearly states the\n\nstatutes under which its claims purport to arise.       Aside from an\n\noverlap between two counts alleging torts under Puerto Rico state\n\nlaw, each count invokes a different statutory basis for the claims\n\nstated   therein.        The   complaint    divides   Cortés-Rivera's\n\ndiscrimination claims under the ADA, § 504, and Puerto Rico state\n\nlaw into three separate counts. Indeed, the complaint confines its\n\nclaims under the ADA to Count One and its claims under § 504 to\n\nCount Two.    To interpret Count Three to include retaliation claims\n\nunder the ADA, § 504, and Puerto Rico state law would disrupt the\n\ninternal logic present in the remainder of the complaint.\n\n             Cortés-Rivera cannot raise a federal retaliation claim if\n\nthat claim was not present in his complaint.          His subsequent\n\nreferences to a purported federal retaliation claim do not alter\n\nthis result. The \"fundamental purpose of our pleadings rules is to\n\nprotect a defendant's 'inalienable right to know in advance the\n\nnature of the cause of action being asserted against him.'\"      Ruiz\n\nRivera v. Pfizer Pharm., LLC, 521 F.3d 76, 85 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(quoting Rodriguez v. Doral Mortg. Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1171 (1st\n\nCir. 1995)).      Neither DOCR nor CHSC moved for summary judgment\n\n\nof the alleged retaliation, as well as two assertions by way of\nbackground that Cortés-Rivera filed complaints with the EEOC for\nboth discrimination and retaliation. For reasons outlined below,\nhowever, these statements do not outweigh the substance and\nstructure of the remainder of the complaint.\n\n                                  -15-\n\fagainst Cortés-Rivera's purported federal retaliation claim.    The\n\nmagistrate judge's opinion did not recognize the possibility that\n\nsuch a claim existed.    Before the district court and this court,\n\nCortés-Rivera has identified a purported federal retaliation claim\n\nto evade CHSC's and DOCR's argument that he has failed to present\n\na valid federal claim.   \"Faced with a well-reasoned and convincing\n\nmotion for summary judgment,\" he has \"shifted legal theories and\n\nsought to re-characterize [his] Complaint in a way that might parry\n\n[the defendants'] blow.\"   Id.    Our pleading requirements are not\n\ndesigned to reward such efforts.    Cortés-Rivera pled the claim as\n\na state-law claim and the district court, having dismissed the\n\nfederal claims, permissively dismissed the pendent state claims.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f",

Enrique Cortés-Rivera, a doctor,\n\nappeals from a grant of summary judgment entered by the district\n\ncourt on his claim that his contract to provide medical services\n\nwas illegally terminated.        Cortés-Rivera worked as an independent\n\ncontractor      in    Puerto   Rico's    Department       of    Corrections    and\n\nRehabilitation (DOCR) between 2002 and 2007.              He alleges that DOCR\n\nand its managing corporation, the Correctional Health Services\n\nCorporation (CHSC), discriminated and retaliated against him on the\n\nbasis of disability in violation of Title I of the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\n(§ 504), and Puerto Rico state law.\n\n            The district court treated Cortés-Rivera's pleading,\n\nstyled as a motion to oppose CHSC's summary judgment motion, as\n\nuntimely.    The main thrust of Cortés-Rivera's case was that he was\n\nan employee of CHSC and DOCR for purposes of his Title I and § 504\n\nclaims,   not    an   independent   contractor.           In    granting   summary\n\njudgment for CHSC and DOCR, the district court made three holdings:\n\n(1) Cortés-Rivera was not an employee of CHSC or DOCR for purposes\n\nof the ADA, (2) Cortés-Rivera neither objected to a magistrate\n\njudge's conclusion that his non-employee status precluded his\n\nreasonable      accommodation    claims       under   §   504    nor   adequately\n\npresented this issue to the district court, and (3) Cortés-Rivera\n\nhad failed to raise a federal retaliation claim.                    The district\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fcourt declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Cortés-\n\nRivera's state-law claims.      We affirm.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            A general practitioner, Cortés-Rivera began working for\n\nDOCR in 2002.   In a pair of service contracts entered that year, he\n\nagreed to provide emergency room and ambulatory services to the\n\nprison population at Guayama Correctional Facility.         Cortés-Rivera\n\nentered a superseding service contract on July 1, 2006.          In this\n\ncontract, set to expire on June 30, 2007, Cortés-Rivera agreed to\n\nprovide ambulatory services for DOCR.        In a letter dated November\n\n15, 2006, DOCR terminated this contract early, effective January 8,\n\n2007.   Cortés-Rivera entered a final service contract with DOCR on\n\nFebruary 20, 2007, which expired about four months later on June\n\n30, 2007.\n\n            During the course of these contracts, between January and\n\nMarch   2006,   Cortés-Rivera    was    diagnosed   with   Guillain-Barre\n\nsyndrome. Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder in\n\nwhich the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral\n\nnervous system.    It leads to varying degrees of physical weakness\n\nand, in some cases, paralysis.         There is no known cure for the\n\ndisorder, though therapies may lessen its severity and accelerate\n\nrecovery.   Cortés-Rivera's Guillian-Barre syndrome led to complete\n\nparalysis of his left leg and foot.          The parties do not contest\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fthat Cortés-Rivera qualifies as an individual with a disability\n\nwithin the meaning of federal disability laws.\n\n              Also during the course of Cortés-Rivera's contracts, DOCR\n\nentered into an agreement with another entity, CHSC, providing that\n\nCHSC would manage DOCR's Correctional Health Program.               Under the\n\nagreement, CHSC assumed full supervisory authority over employees\n\nand contractors of DOCR.        The contract provided that employees and\n\ncontractors of DOCR would remain such until their relationship with\n\nDOCR was either terminated or modified.               This contract entered\n\nforce in 2005 and remained in force through the expiration of\n\nCortés-Rivera's last service contract.\n\n              In a letter dated September 19, 2006, Cortés-Rivera\n\nrequested      accommodations     to    address   difficulties    he    had   in\n\naccessing punch clocks used to measure attendance and timeliness at\n\nthe correctional facility.        This request was denied in a September\n\n27,   2006,    letter    from   the    Clinical   Services   Director   of    the\n\nCorrectional Health Program.           The letter stated that Cortés-Rivera\n\nwas not a regular employee and thus did not have the privileges of\n\nsuch employees.         The letter nonetheless recommended that Cortés-\n\nRivera's supervisor consult with him about placing him in one of\n\ntwo particular areas of the facility that would be more accessible.\n\nCortés-Rivera was subsequently placed in one of those areas.\n\n              In a letter dated October 23, 2006, the chief executive\n\nofficer of CHSC notified the secretary of DOCR, Miguel Pereira-\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fCastillo, that layoffs would be necessary to address a projected\n\nbudget deficit for DOCR.     He requested that DOCR cancel six of its\n\nprofessional service contracts, including Cortés-Rivera's.             The\n\nofficer wrote that one of the professionals rendered services that\n\nwere no longer necessary.          He wrote that the remaining five\n\nprofessionals, including Cortés-Rivera, were selected because they\n\nhad the least seniority in the institution where they rendered\n\nservices.   On November 15, 2006, Pereira-Castillo notified Cortés-\n\nRivera that his contract would be terminated effective January 8,\n\n2007.   DOCR nonetheless entered a subsequent contract with Cortés-\n\nRivera on February 20, 2007, effective until June 30, 2007.\n\n            On November 20, 2007, Cortés-Rivera filed a complaint\n\nalleging    disability   discrimination    and   retaliation.     As   to\n\ndiscrimination, Cortés-Rivera claimed that the defendants denied\n\nhis   request   for   reasonable   accommodation   and    terminated   his\n\ncontract in violation of Title I of the ADA and § 504.             As to\n\nretaliation, he made two claims, asserting that they were made\n\nunder Puerto Rico state law.        First, he asserted that the early\n\ntermination of his July 31, 2006, contract was in retaliation for\n\nhis accommodation request. Second, he asserted that the defendants\n\nrefused to alter his February 20, 2007, contract because he filed\n\nclaims concerning the prior termination with the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity     Commission   (EEOC).      Cortés-Rivera    also   alleged\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdiscrimination and various common law claims in tort and contract\n\nunder Puerto Rico state law.\n\n            Adopting the recommendations of a magistrate judge, the\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment to the defendants.                           As a\n\npreliminary matter, the district court held that Cortés-Rivera did\n\nnot timely oppose CHSC's motion for summary judgment.                           On the\n\nmerits of the joint motion for summary judgment, the district court\n\nmade three holdings: (1) Cortés-Rivera was not an employee of DOCR\n\nor CHSC under Title I of the ADA, (2) Cortés-Rivera failed to\n\nobject to the magistrate's conclusion that his non-employee status\n\nbarred his reasonable accommodation claim under § 504 and failed to\n\nadequately contest the issue in the district court, and (3) Cortés-\n\nRivera did not raise a federal retaliation claim.                      The district\n\ncourt declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Cortés-\n\nRivera's state claims in the absence of a valid federal claim.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            On appeal, Cortés-Rivera challenges both the district\n\ncourt's finding that he did not timely oppose CHSC's summary\n\njudgment motion and the district court's three holdings on the\n\nmerits.         As    to   the   timeliness    of   his   opposition      to    summary\n\njudgment, he argues that the district court abused its discretion\n\ngiven     the        purported    seriousness       of    its   holding        and    the\n\nreasonableness of his reading of the deadline.                    As to the three\n\nclaims on the merits, Cortés-Rivera argues that (1) he is an\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\femployee of DOCR and CHSC for purposes of Title I of the ADA, (2)\n\nhe may bring an employment discrimination claim under § 504 even if\n\nhe does not qualify as an employee under Title I of the ADA, and\n\n(3) he raised federal retaliation claims for purposes of Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 8.\n\n            We first address Cortés-Rivera's claim concerning the\n\ntiming of his opposition to CHSC's summary judgment motion.                     We\n\nthen turn to his three claims on the merits of CHSC's and DOCR's\n\njoint motion for summary judgment.\n\nA.

He argues that the district court should have given\n\nhim an extension, though he did not seek one, because it previously\n\nextended a deadline for DOCR.       He also implies that he should have\n\nbeen awarded an extension so that he could oppose both CHSC's\n\nmotion for summary judgment and DOCR's motion for summary judgment\n\nat the same time.

Cortés-Rivera does not purport to raise a\n\nmaterial fact on this appeal relevant to CHSC's motion but not\n\nDOCR's motion.      The only factual issue he argues is in dispute\n\nconcerns whether Cortés-Rivera was an employee of either CHSC or\n\nDOCR;   the    relevant   facts   are   essentially   the   same    for   both\n\ndefendants.

The Independent Contractor Issue\n\n            Cortés-Rivera's claim that the district court erred in\n\nconcluding that he was not an employee of DOCR or CHSC for purposes\n\nof Title I of the ADA warrants little discussion.             Cortés-Rivera\n\npresents    no   argument    to   support   this   claim   beyond   the   bald\n\nassertion that he raised a material fact as to his employment\n\nstatus before the district court.

We deem this issue waived.\n\n            2.      We Decline to Reach the § 504 Claim\n\n            Cortés-Rivera's second claim fails for much the same\n\nreason.     He argues that employment discrimination claims under\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f§ 504 are not limited by the definition of employee in Title I of\n\nthe ADA.    To address this claim would require that we interpret a\n\nprovision added to § 504 after Congress passed the ADA.                That\n\nprovision, 29 U.S.C. § 794(d), states that \"[t]he standards used to\n\ndetermine whether this section has been violated in a complaint\n\nalleging employment discrimination under this section shall be the\n\nstandards   applied   under   title   I   of   the   [ADA]\"   and   various\n\nmiscellaneous provisions of the ADA \"as such sections relate to\n\nemployment.\"\n\n            This court has not addressed whether 29 U.S.C. § 794(d)\n\nrequires that plaintiffs alleging employment discrimination under\n\n§ 504 meet the ADA's definition of employee.           The four circuits\n\nthat have considered this issue are split.           The Sixth and Eighth\n\ncircuits have held that 29 U.S.C. § 794(d) does require that\n\nplaintiffs alleging employment discrimination under § 504 meet the\n\nADA's definition of employee.

Important\n\nissues of statutory interpretation require adequate briefing in all\n\nlevels of the federal court system, and here we have none.\n\n               In the district court, Cortés-Rivera neither adequately\n\nobjected to the magistrate judge's recommendation nor adequately\n\nbriefed the issue for the district court's consideration.                       The\n\nmagistrate judge faced a dispute over whether CHSC and DOCR were\n\nrecipients of federal financial assistance and therefore subject to\n\n\n\n        1\n          The district court made this conclusion explicit with\nrespect to Cortés-Rivera's objection to the magistrate judge's\nrecommendation regarding CHSC's motion for summary judgment. It\nwas not so explicit with respect to Cortés-Rivera's objection to\nthe magistrate judge's recommendation regarding DOCR's motion, but\nit held that Cortés-Rivera presented \"the same objection . . . with\nregard to the first report and recommendation\" concerning CHSC's\nmotion for summary judgment.     Cortés-Rivera's objection to the\nmagistrate judge's report concerning DOCR's motion was slightly\nmore developed than his objection to the report concerning CHSC's\nmotion, but it still did not raise a specific objection to the\nmagistrate judge's application of Wojewski.\n\n                                        -11-\n\f§ 504.   Rather than decide this issue, the magistrate judge stated\n\nthat even if CHSC and DOCR did receive federal funds, no § 504\n\nclaim was stated under the reasoning of Wojewski.     Cortés-Rivera\n\nmade no specific objection to this, as the district court noted.\n\nBeyond that, in his argument before the district court, Cortés-\n\nRivera only referenced Wojewski to argue that he was an employee,\n\nnot a contractor.     He made, at most, only a cursory and implicit\n\nargument that even if he was a contractor, Wojewski was wrongly\n\ndecided.\n\n           This is a double default. First, Cortés-Rivera's failure\n\nto object to the magistrate's interpretation constitutes waiver.\n\nSantiago v.

Second, Cortés-Rivera failed to adequately brief the issue to\n\nthe district court.    See Castillo v.

That the district court stated that it viewed Wojewski\n\nas correct does not require that we exercise our discretion to\n\nforgive this double default.     See Gonzalez v.

We do not even know whether this case actually would\n\nrequire that we resolve this issue if we had adequate briefing.\n\nEven       if   it    did    so   require,   Cortés-Rivera     merely      seeks   to\n\ndistinguish Wojewski on its facts and states that § 504 does not\n\ninclude a definition of \"employee\" like the ADA.                     The statement\n\nthat § 504 does not include a definition of \"employee\" ignores the\n\nvery question purportedly raised in this appeal: whether 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 794(d) incorporates the definition of \"employee\" in the ADA.2\n\n                3.          Retaliation\n\n                Next, Cortés-Rivera argues that he raised a federal\n\nretaliation claim on the face of his complaint.                      Cortés-Rivera\n\ninvokes the liberal pleading requirements set out in Fed. R.

The plaintiff in Morales-\n\nVallellanes alleged discrimination and retaliation but \"fail[ed] to\n\ncite any statutory basis for relief.\"                 Id. at 14.       The parties\n\ndisputed whether he had raised a Title VII claim in addition to a\n\nclaim under a collective bargaining agreement.                     Given \"both the\n\nsubstance       and     structure\"   of   the    complaint,   we    held   that    the\n\nplaintiff had pleaded both claims under Rule 8.                Id. at 15.\n\n\n\n       2\n          Cortés-Rivera's assertion about the absence of a\ndefinition of \"employee\" in § 504 as originally adopted gestures\ntoward an argument about the broader purpose of that provision and\nits relationship with the ADA.

Cortés-Rivera       divided   his\n\ncomplaint into several counts.      The first alleged discrimination\n\nunder Title I of the ADA.    The second alleged discrimination under\n\n§ 504.    The third, in question here, alleged acts committed \"with\n\nretaliatory animus, thus in violation to [sic] the Puerto Rico Laws\n\n115, and Law 426 of November 2000, and constitut[ing] a tort under\n\nthe Civil Code of Puerto Rico 31 L.P.R.A. section 1802, and the\n\nConstitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" Three additional\n\ncounts alleged various claims under Puerto Rico state law.\n\n           The plain language of Count Three states that Cortés-\n\nRivera's retaliation claims arose under state law, not federal law.\n\nIn Count Three, Cortés-Rivera only alleged violations of Puerto\n\nRico state law.    Count Three alleged retaliation resulting from\n\nCortés-Rivera's    choice   to   \"exercise[]   his   right    under    the\n\nAmerican[s] with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act to\n\nfile a complaint before the EEOC and for joining a civil action.\"\n\nThis language about the ADA and § 504, which also appears in\n\nsimilar terms in the background to the complaint, merely states a\n\nrationale for the retaliatory conduct Cortés-Rivera alleges.            It\n\ndoes not assert a legal basis for that claim.3\n\n\n     3\n          In Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200588\"><a href=\"/opinion/200588/morales-vallellanes-v-united-states-postal/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir.\n2003) we deemed it relevant that the complaint was \"replete with\nreferences to plaintiff's EEO initiatives.\" Id. at 15. Cortés-\nRivera notes that his complaint also contains references to the\nEEOC process. The complaint made the above claims about the source\n\n                                  -14-\n\f             The structure of the complaint reinforces Count Three's\n\nplain language.     Each count of the complaint clearly states the\n\nstatutes under which its claims purport to arise.       Aside from an\n\noverlap between two counts alleging torts under Puerto Rico state\n\nlaw, each count invokes a different statutory basis for the claims\n\nstated   therein.        The   complaint    divides   Cortés-Rivera's\n\ndiscrimination claims under the ADA, § 504, and Puerto Rico state\n\nlaw into three separate counts. Indeed, the complaint confines its\n\nclaims under the ADA to Count One and its claims under § 504 to\n\nCount Two.    To interpret Count Three to include retaliation claims\n\nunder the ADA, § 504, and Puerto Rico state law would disrupt the\n\ninternal logic present in the remainder of the complaint.\n\n             Cortés-Rivera cannot raise a federal retaliation claim if\n\nthat claim was not present in his complaint.          His subsequent\n\nreferences to a purported federal retaliation claim do not alter\n\nthis result. The \"fundamental purpose of our pleadings rules is to\n\nprotect a defendant's 'inalienable right to know in advance the\n\nnature of the cause of action being asserted against him.'\"      Ruiz\n\nRivera v.

Neither DOCR nor CHSC moved for summary judgment\n\n\nof the alleged retaliation, as well as two assertions by way of\nbackground that Cortés-Rivera filed complaints with the EEOC for\nboth discrimination and retaliation. For reasons outlined below,\nhowever, these statements do not outweigh the substance and\nstructure of the remainder of the complaint.\n\n                                  -15-\n\fagainst Cortés-Rivera's purported federal retaliation claim.    The\n\nmagistrate judge's opinion did not recognize the possibility that\n\nsuch a claim existed.    Before the district court and this court,\n\nCortés-Rivera has identified a purported federal retaliation claim\n\nto evade CHSC's and DOCR's argument that he has failed to present\n\na valid federal claim.   \"Faced with a well-reasoned and convincing\n\nmotion for summary judgment,\" he has \"shifted legal theories and\n\nsought to re-characterize [his] Complaint in a way that might parry\n\n[the defendants'] blow.\"   Id.    Our pleading requirements are not\n\ndesigned to reward such efforts.    Cortés-Rivera pled the claim as\n\na state-law claim and the district court, having dismissed the\n\nfederal claims, permissively dismissed the pendent state claims.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f</pre>",
