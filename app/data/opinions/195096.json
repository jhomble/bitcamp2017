See,  e.g., In re  San\n                                                                 \n\nJuan Dupont Plaza  Hotel Fire Litig., 989  F.2d 36, 38 (1st  Cir.\n                                    \n\n1993).   So it is here.   We agree with  the court below that, in\n\nthis case, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and\n\nthat plaintiff's case fails as  a matter of law.
