Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Emily Anne\nRadford, Assistant Director, Office of Immigration Litigation, and\nThomas K. Ragland, Attorney, U.S. Department of Justice, Civil\nDivision, on motion for summary affirmance, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                            October 28, 2004\n\f          Per     Curiam.   The    government     has    moved     for    summary\n\naffirmance of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") decision\n\naffirming without opinion the decision of the immigration judge\n\n(\"IJ\") finding appellant Maria Brito de Figueroa (\"Brito\") and her\n\nfour   children    deportable.          Appellants      challenge    the      IJ's\n\ndetermination     that   Brito    was   deportable      pursuant    to    Section\n\n241(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") for\n\nhaving obtained her resident status through a fraudulent marriage\n\nto Miguel Angel Figueroa-Burgos (\"Figueroa\").\n\n          Rather     than   attacking     the    IJ's    decision        directly,\n\nappellants argue that the BIA \"failed to follow its own regulatory\n\nprocedure when it issued the affirmance without opinion (AWO) in\n\nthis case.\" Appellants' Brief at 2.             Appellants appear to argue\n\nthat the AWO procedure was inappropriate here because this case\n\ndoes not satisfy the following criteria: \"that the result reached\n\nby the IJ was correct [and] that any errors in the decision were\n\nharmless or non-material.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4).              Specifically,\n\nthey claim the following errors by the IJ: consideration of hearsay\n\nand other unreliable evidence, failure to consider certain evidence\n\nsubmitted by appellants, and failure to make findings supporting\n\nhis conclusion that the marriage was fraudulent.            Appellants argue\n\nthat by affirming without opinion an erroneous decision, the BIA\n\nviolated appellants' constitutional right to due process of law.\n\n          We review appellants' due process claims de novo. See\n\nYongo v. INS, 355 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 2004); Aguilar-Solis v. INS,\n\f168 F.3d 565, 568 (1st Cir. 1999).      \"The Federal Rules of Evidence\n\ndo not apply in INS proceedings, but the less rigid constraints of\n\ndue process impose outer limits based upon considerations of\n\nfairness and reliability.\" Yongo, 355 F.3d at 30.     In this case the\n\nrecord provides no support for appellants' claims that the IJ\n\nviolated considerations of fairness and reliability.\n\n            The BIA issued an AWO as to each appellant, dated October\n\n22, 2003.    Each AWO stated in its entirety that \"The Board affirms,\n\nwithout opinion, the result of the decision below.       The decision\n\nbelow is, therefore, the final agency determination. See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.1(e)(4).\"     We have confronted this procedure before.     We\n\nhave said:\n\n               The AWO procedure allows affirmance by a\n          single Board member, rather than the usual\n          three-member review.     The IJ's opinion is\n          affirmed without further analysis, with the\n          statement,   \"The   Board   affirms,   without\n          opinion, the result of the decision below.\" 8\n          C.F.R. § 3.1(e)(4)(B)(ii). The AWO procedure\n          is available when a Board member determines\n          that the result reached by the IJ was correct,\n          that any errors in the decision were harmless\n          or non-material, and that either the issue is\n          squarely controlled by precedent and does not\n          involve a novel fact pattern, or that the\n          factual and legal questions raised are so\n          insubstantial that three-member review is not\n          warranted. Id. § 3.1(e)(4)(A)-(B).\nEl Moraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 205-06 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            We recently rejected a claim that the AWO procedure\n\nviolates due process. See Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 377 (1st\n\nCir. 2003)(reasoning that intelligent review is possible without an\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fopinion by the BIA because \"[t]he courts will continue to have the\n\nIJ's decision and the record upon which it is based available for\n\nreview\").   To the extent that appellants are arguing that specific\n\nerrors by the IJ resulted in due process violations, we find those\n\nclaims to be without merit.\n\n            I. Figueroa's Sworn Statements\n\n            Appellants object to the IJ's reliance upon Figueroa's\n\nwritten sworn statements (Exhibits 3 and 6) on the ground that they\n\nwere not given voluntarily and were signed under duress.                  This\n\nargument is likely waived.         After all, the appellants did not\n\nobject at     the   immigration   hearing   to    the   admission   of   those\n\nstatements.     And even if the appellants have not waived their\n\npresent objection, the record provides no support for its premise.\n\nThe IJ considered the argument that the sworn statements were not\n\ngiven voluntarily and rejected it based upon the testimony of\n\nFigueroa and the INS officers present when the statements were\n\ngiven.   Such findings of fact and credibility calls are reviewed\n\nunder a \"deferential 'substantial evidence' standard.\" Mendes v.\n\nINS, 197 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir. 1999).             Our review of the record\n\ndemonstrates that the standard is easily satisfied in this case.\n\n            II. Hearsay Evidence\n\n            Appellants claim that the IJ erred by relying upon\n\ntestimony of an INS agent \"based on speculations and on comments\n\nallegedly made by parties not available to be cross-examined.\" The\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\ftestimony at issue corroborated Figueroa's sworn statement that he\n\nhad been in a common law marriage with Alicia Santiago-Gonzalez for\n\nnine years.          Such    testimony          was    elicited      by    appellants'       own\n\nattorney, however, and any objection has therefore been waived. See\n\nWillco Kuwait (Trading) S.A.K. v. deSavary, 843 F.2d 618, 625 (1st\n\nCir. 1988).          Even absent a waiver, any error would have been\n\nharmless    in      view    of    the    IJ's    reliance      upon       Figueroa's       sworn\n\nstatement that he had been paid by Brito to marry her so that she\n\ncould obtain residency papers.\n\n              III. Failure to Consider Evidence\n\n              Appellants claim that the IJ failed to consider evidence\n\nsubmitted     by     them    which       supported      a   finding       of    a   bona    fide\n\nmarriage.      Due process does not required the IJ specifically to\n\nmention each piece of evidence that is presented. See Kalitani v.\n\nAshcroft, 340 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2003).                       Moreover, the record in\n\nthis   case      indicates        that    the     IJ    specifically           addressed     the\n\ndocumentary evidence submitted by respondents and articulated his\n\nreasons for not finding it persuasive.                      Appellants' claim that the\n\nIJ failed to consider the evidence they submitted is belied by the\n\nrecord.\n\n              IV. Failure to Point to Evidence Supporting Conclusion\n\nthat Marriage was Fraudulent\n\n              The    claim       that    the    IJ    failed    to   point       to   evidence\n\nsupporting his conclusion that the marriage was fraudulent is\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\fbelied   by    the    IJ's     lengthy   and    detailed    decision.       The   IJ\n\nspecifically discussed the evidence on which he relied in finding\n\nthat   neither       Brito's    nor   Figueroa's    testimony     was   credible.\n\nConversely, the IJ found that the INS Officers' \"narration of the\n\nevents   surrounding         the   statements     taken    from   [Figueroa]      was\n\ncredible.\"       Therefore,        the   IJ    relied   upon   Figueroa's    sworn\n\nstatements that he and Brito had never lived together as husband\n\nand wife and that he had married her because he was offered payment\n\nto do so in order to aid Brito in obtaining residency papers.                     The\n\nIJ sufficiently identified and discussed the evidence on which he\n\nrelied in reaching his decision.\n\n              We conclude that the record does not support appellants'\n\nclaims of error by the IJ. Therefore, the BIA's decision summarily\n\naffirming his decision must be upheld.              Accordingly, the petition\n\nfor review is denied.          See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f",

The   IJ\n\nspecifically discussed the evidence on which he relied in finding\n\nthat   neither       Brito's    nor   Figueroa's    testimony     was   credible.\n\nConversely, the IJ found that the INS Officers' \"narration of the\n\nevents   surrounding         the   statements     taken    from   [Figueroa]      was\n\ncredible.\"       Therefore,        the   IJ    relied   upon   Figueroa's    sworn\n\nstatements that he and Brito had never lived together as husband\n\nand wife and that he had married her because he was offered payment\n\nto do so in order to aid Brito in obtaining residency papers.                     The\n\nIJ sufficiently identified and discussed the evidence on which he\n\nrelied in reaching his decision.\n\n              We conclude that the record does not support appellants'\n\nclaims of error by the IJ. Therefore, the BIA's decision summarily\n\naffirming his decision must be upheld.              Accordingly, the petition\n\nfor review is denied.          See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f</pre>",
