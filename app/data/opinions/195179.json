Appellant  Leo  Vartanian\n                                    \n\n(\"Vartanian\")  brought   claims  against  his   former  employer,\n\nAppellee  Monsanto  Chemical  Company   (\"Monsanto\"),  under  the\n\nEmployment  Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C.  \n\n1001  et seq.,  pursuant to  Section 502(a)  of ERISA,  29 U.S.C.\n             \n\n1132(a), as well  as under common  law,1 asserting that  Monsanto\n\nbreached   its   fiduciary   duty   and   engaged   in   unlawful\n\ndiscrimination  and   misrepresentation.    The   district  court\n\ndismissed  Vartanian's complaint  for failure  to  state a  claim\n\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Vartanian appeals\n\nthe district court's dismissal of his claims.\n\n          According to the facts alleged by  Vartanian, Vartanian\n\nworked for Monsanto for nearly 37 years.  He was a participant in\n\nthe Monsanto  Company  Salaried  Employees  Pension  Plan  (\"1986\n\nPlan\").    The 1986  Plan  offered several  options  to retirees,\n\nincluding  the  option  to  receive  various  types  of  periodic\n\npayments (annuities) or to take all  benefits in a lump sum.   In\n\naccordance  with the  requirements of  the  1986 Plan,  Vartanian\n\nsubmitted a lump sum distribution request at least one year prior\n\nto  his anticipated early  retirement date.   Vartanian submitted\n\n                    \n\n1    Vartanian's  complaint  alleges   a  claim  for  common  law\nmisrepresentation, without specifying whether he means federal or\nstate  common law.   The  district court  in its  opinion clearly\ninterpreted  the claim  to be  a  claim under  state common  law.\nRather than filing a motion to reconsider with the district court\nand  explaining  to the  district  court that  it  had mistakenly\nconsidered  his claim to  assert a state law  claim rather than a\nfederal  law claim, Vartanian appealed the district court's order\nof  dismissal.   In  the  present case,  we  review the  district\ncourt's decision and  find it unnecessary to  recognize a federal\ncommon law claim.  See infra note 5 and accompanying text.\n                            \n\n                               -2-\n\nthis request in  March, 1990 for an  anticipated early retirement\n\ndate of May 1, 1991.\n\n          In  February, 1991,  Vartanian started  to hear  rumors\n\nthat  Monsanto  was  going  to  offer  a   more  favorable  early\n\nretirement package  as a retirement incentive in the near future.\n\nMonsanto  had a  history  of  using  early  retirement  incentive\n\nprograms, having done  so in 1981, 1985  and 1990.  As  rumors of\n\nearly  retirement offerings  persisted, sometime  in  February or\n\nMarch, 1991, Vartanian asked his supervisor about the possibility\n\nof an early retirement offering and requested that the supervisor\n\ninquire about this possibility.  Several weeks later, Vartanian's\n\nsupervisor responded  that he  could not  confirm any rumors  and\n\nthat there were \"no plans\" regarding the early retirement offer.\n\n          In  April, 1991, Vartanian repeated the same inquiry to\n\nhis  supervisor  who again  responded  that there  were  no plans\n\nregarding  an  early  retirement  arrangement.    Vartanian  also\n\nquestioned  the  Springfield  Personnel   Supervisor  as  to  the\n\npossibility of  an early  retirement incentive  offering and  was\n\ntold that  there  were no  plans  for  any such  offering.    The\n\nSpringfield supervisor asked  Vartanian if he would  refrain from\n\nretiring  on  May 1, 1991  if  such  a  program  were  available.\n\nVartanian responded that  he would want to study  any new program\n\nand certainly have  the option of delaying the  effective date of\n\nhis early retirement, depending on  the option.  Vartanian had in\n\nfact  postponed a previously elected early retirement so he could\n\nwork on certain  projects for Monsanto.  Vartanian  retired as of\n\n                               -3-\n\nMay 1,  1991, and took  a lump sum distribution  of approximately\n\n$509,000 under the 1986 Plan.\n\n          On   or  about  June  28,  1991,  Monsanto's  Board  of\n\nDirectors   approved   a   restructuring  plan   which   involved\n\nconsolidating   manufacturing    operations,   closing    plants,\n\nreorganizing businesses and reducing the number of employees.  As\n\nof February, 1991,  when Vartanian made specific  inquiries about\n\nearly  retirement incentive  programs,  Monsanto  had,  in  fact,\n\nalready  given  serious  consideration to  staff  reductions  and\n\nchanges  in  the 1986  Pension  Plan  and was  contemplating  the\n\nformation  of  the  Monsanto  Special Voluntary  Retirement  Plan\n\n(\"1991 Plan\").\n\n          Vartanian  alleges  that  he  was  denied  a reasonable\n\nopportunity  to make  an informed  decision about when  to retire\n\nbecause  Monsanto  failed  to disclose  its  consideration  of an\n\nenhanced severance program.   If Vartanian had  received complete\n\nand  truthful information,  he would  have continued  to work  at\n\nMonsanto  until December  1,  1991  and,  thus, would  have  been\n\neligible for full benefits under  the 1991 Plan announced on June\n\n28, 1991.\n\n          Vartanian exhausted  all administrative  procedures and\n\nplan appeal procedures  in his claim for benefits  under the 1991\n\nPlan.  Monsanto denied  Vartanian's claim because he had  retired\n\non May  1, 1991 and, therefore,  was not employed by  Monsanto on\n\nOctober 1,  1991,  which  was a  requirement  for  eligibility to\n\nparticipate in the 1991 Plan.\n\n                               -4-\n\n          In  the court  below, Vartanian  alleged  that Monsanto\n\nbreached its fiduciary  duty in violation of 29  U.S.C.   1104(a)\n\nby  failing to  disclose  its  intention to  create  a new,  more\n\ngenerous retirement  package  or the  fact that  the company  was\n\ngiving \"serious consideration\" to such a plan.  Vartanian claimed\n\nthat  as  a  result  of  his reliance  on  Monsanto's  misleading\n\nstatements  to the  effect that  the  company did  not intend  to\n\ncreate   a  more  generous  retirement  package,  he  missed  the\n\nopportunity to retire  under the more advantageous  provisions of\n\nthe new plan which went into effect shortly after his retirement.\n\nVartanian also alleged  unlawful discrimination  in violation  of\n\nSection 510 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C.   1140.\n\n          Under Section 502 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C.   1132(a), only a\n\n\"participant\"  or \"beneficiary\" may bring a private civil action.\n\nVartanian claims  that he  had standing to  sue because he  was a\n\n\"participant.\"  The district court found, however, that Vartanian\n\nwas not  a \"participant\"  as defined by  29 U.S.C.    1002(7)  of\n\nERISA  and thus, did not have standing  to sue under Section 502.\n\nBecause Section  502 is the  sole civil enforcement  provision of\n\nERISA, the  district court  dismissed both  of Vartanian's  ERISA\n\nclaims.  The district court also dismissed Vartanian's common law\n\nclaims  alleging misrepresentation.  The court found that because\n\nthese  are state  law claims  which \"relate  to\" ERISA,  they are\n\ntherefore  preempted by  Section 514(a)  of ERISA,   29  U.S.C.  \n\n1144(a).\n\n          On appeal, Vartanian maintains that the  district court\n\n                               -5-\n\nerred in  dismissing his claims.   Vartanian argues that,  at the\n\ntime  Monsanto  made  the alleged  misrepresentations,  he  was a\n\n\"participant\"  in an employee benefit  plan (the 1986 Plan), that\n\nMonsanto's breach  of  its fiduciary  duty  caused him  to  leave\n\nshortly before the 1991 Plan was adopted.  Furthermore, Vartanian\n\nclaims that but for Monsanto's misrepresentations,  he would be a\n\n\"participant\" in the 1991  Plan under 29 U.S.C.   1002(7) and, as\n\nsuch, he  has standing to  assert claims for breach  of fiduciary\n\nduty,   unlawful  discrimination   and  misrepresentation   under\n\nERISA.2  He argues  that the  ERISA  definition of  \"participant\"\n\nrefers to  a person who  is, or may become  eligible for benefits\n\n\"from an  employee benefits plan\"  and does not require  that the\n                                \n\nperson be eligible for benefits from two  employee benefit plans.\n                                        \n\nThus, because he  was a participant  in the 1986 Plan,  he claims\n\nthat, it was not  necessary that he be a participant  in the 1991\n\nPlan in order to have standing under  ERISA.  In the alternative,\n\nVartanian  argues that,  even if  he  does not  have standing  to\n\nassert claims under ERISA, this federal statute does not  preempt\n\nhis state common law claims  and this case should be remanded  to\n\nthe  district  court  for further  proceedings  to  determine the\n\nmerits of his common law claims.\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\n                                          \n\n          We  review the district  court's decision to  grant the\n\n                    \n\n2    Vartanian  also  points  out  that  the 1991  Plan  had  two\ncomponents, enhancement  of benefits  under the 1986  Plan and  a\nseparate cash payment.   He suggests that he is  a participant in\nthat portion of  the 1991 Plan that consists of an enhancement of\nbenefits under the 1986 Plan.\n\n                               -6-\n\nmotion to dismiss  Vartanian's claim under Federal  Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure  12(b)(6)  de novo.    Kale  v.  Combined Ins.  Co.  of\n                                                                 \n\nAmerica, 925 F.2d 1161, 1165 (1st Cir. 1991).  We must accept the\n       \n\nallegations of the  complaint as true, and if,  under any theory,\n\nthe  allegations are  sufficient to  state a  cause of  action in\n\naccordance  with the  law, we  must deny  the motion  to dismiss.\n\nKnight v. Mills, 836 F.2d 659 (1st Cir. 1987).\n               \n\n                            PREEMPTION\n                                      \n\n          We  first examine  the  district  court's finding  that\n\nVartanian's state law  claims are preempted by  Section 514(a) of\n\nERISA, 29 U.S.C.   1144(a).\n\n          Section 514 of ERISA supersedes \"any and all State laws\n\ninsofar  as they  may now  or  hereafter relate  to any  employee\n                                               \n\nbenefit plan . . . .\"  29 U.S.C.   1144(a) (emphasis added).  The\n\nSupreme  Court  has  established  that  \"a law  'relates  to'  an\n\nemployee  benefit plan  . .  .  if it  has a  connection  with or\n\nreference to such a plan.\"  Ingersoll-Rand, Co. v. McClendon, 498\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 133, 139 (1990).\n\n          In  Ingersoll-Rand, Co.,  the Supreme  Court identified\n                                 \n\ntwo tests for determining whether  a cause of action \"relates to\"\n\nand  is thus,  preempted by  ERISA.   First, a  law is  expressly\n\npreempted by ERISA  where a plaintiff, in order  to prevail, must\n\nplead, and the court must find,  that an ERISA plan exists.   Id.\n                                                                 \n\nat 140.   The cause of action \"relates to\" an  ERISA plan in this\n\ncontext because the court's inquiry must be directed to the plan.\n\nId.  Second, even where there  is no express preemption, a  cause\n   \n\n                               -7-\n\nof action  is preempted  if it conflicts  directly with  an ERISA\n\ncause of action.  Id. at 142.\n                     \n\n          In the present case, the  existence of the 1991 Plan is\n\ninseparably  connected  to any  determination of  liability under\n\nstate common law of misrepresentation.   There is simply no cause\n\nof action  if there is  no plan.   See id.  at 140.   The alleged\n                                          \n\nmisrepresentations by  Monsanto relate  to the  existence of  the\n\n1991 Plan and  in order to prevail under a state common law claim\n\nfor misrepresentation, Vartanian would undoubtedly have to plead,\n\nand the Court would have to find, that the 1991 Plan exists.  See\n                                                                 \n\nid. at 140.  Thus, under  the first test set forth in  Ingersoll-\n                                                                 \n\nRand, Co., Vartanian's  claims \"relate to\" an ERISA  plan and are\n         \n\nexpressly  preempted by ERISA.   See Smith  v. Durham-Bush, Inc.,\n                                                                \n\n959  F.2d 6,  11-12 (2d Cir.  1992); see  also Sanson  v. General\n                                                                 \n\nMotors Corp., 966  F.2d 618, 621 (11th Cir.  1992), cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n113 S. Ct. 1578 (1993).\n\n          Therefore,  we  affirm  the  portion  of  the  district\n\ncourt's  opinion holding that Vartanian's state common law claims\n\nof negligent misrepresentation are preempted by ERISA.\n\n                           ERISA CLAIMS\n                                       \n\n          Next,  we  examine the  district  court's finding  that\n\nVartanian did  not have  standing to pursue  a civil  claim under\n\nERISA.\n\n          Section 502, the civil  enforcement provision of ERISA,\n\nprovides that a \"civil action may be brought by a  participant or\n\n                               -8-\n\nbeneficiary3 to recover  benefits due him under the  terms of his\n\nplan, to enforce  his rights under the  terms of the plan,  or to\n\nclarify  his rights  to future  benefits under  the terms  of the\n\nplan.\"   29  U.S.C.     1132(a)(1)(B).

See Berlin v. Mich. Bell Tel. Co., 858 F.2d 1154,\n                                                 \n\n1163-64 (6th Cir. 1988).   Vartanian's claims thus fall  squarely\n\nwithin the  \"zone of interests\"  ERISA was designed to  protect. \n\nSee Astor, 7 F.3d at 538-39 (former  employees who are within the\n         \n\nzone  of interests  ERISA  was  intended to  protect  held to  be\n\n\"participants\" for purposes of standing).\n\n          We recognize that  the 1991 Plan had not  yet been made\n\navailable   to  Vartanian  at  the  time  of  Monsanto's  alleged\n\nmisrepresentations  nor at the time of Vartanian's retirement and\n\nthus, Vartanian could not technically  be a \"participant\" in  the\n\n1991 Plan.  We believe, however, that given the broadly inclusive\n\nscope  of the  ERISA statute,  and  its preclusion  of all  other\n\njudicial recourse, it would be entirely consistent with the ERISA\n\nstatute for this court to decline  to bar Vartanian, for lack  of\n\n                               -12-\n\n\"standing\",  from  showing  that, \"but  for\"  Monsanto's wrongful\n\nconduct,  he would  be a  \"participant\" in  the 1991  Plan.   Cf.\n                                                                 \n\nChristopher, 950 F.2d at 1221.\n           \n\n          In  reaching our conclusion,  we rely on  the fact that\n\nVartanian  did not know  Monsanto had made  misrepresentations to\n\nhim  and  therefore,  he  could  not have  alleged  a  breach  of\n\nfiduciary  duty by Monsanto  until after he  had received payment\n\nunder the 1986  Plan.  To hold otherwise would imply that when an\n\nemployer breaches its fiduciary duty to an employee under  ERISA,\n\nthe  employee would  have standing  to sue  only if  the employee\n\nfinds  out all of the facts  constituting the breach prior to his\n\nreceipt of retirement  benefits.  Such a holding  would enable an\n\nemployer to  defeat the employee's right  to sue for a  breach of\n\nfiduciary duty by keeping his  breach a well guarded secret until\n\nthe employee receives his benefits or, by distributing a lump sum\n\nand terminating benefits before the  employee can file suit.  The\n\nemployee would  have no  standing to state  a claim  under ERISA,\n\neven where the employer's breach of fiduciary duty takes the form\n\nof misrepresentations  that induced  the employee  to retire  and\n\nreceive the  payment of benefits.   Congress did not  intend such\n\nunjust and arbitrary results.4\n\n                    \n\n4  We are aware of decisions  of other courts that are frequently\ncited  for the proposition  that the term  \"participant\" excludes\nplaintiffs who have already received all of their vested benefits\nin the form of  a lump sum payment under  a benefit plan.

Thus,  Vartanian has  standing to\n\nassert his claims under ERISA even though he has already received\n\nhis benefits under the 1986 Plan.\n\n                        FEDERAL COMMON LAW\n                                          \n\n          On appeal, Vartanian requests that this court recognize\n\na federal common law claim for misrepresentation.\n\n          Although  this  court  has  noted  that  Congress   has\n\n                    \n\ndenied,  499  U.S.  920  (1991).

Sec. 1001 et seq., pursuant to Section 502(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. 1132(a), as well as under common law,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> asserting that Monsanto breached its fiduciary duty and engaged in unlawful discrimination and misrepresentation.  The district court dismissed Vartanian's complaint for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), 822 F.Supp. 36.   Vartanian appeals the district court's dismissal of his claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the facts alleged by Vartanian, Vartanian worked for Monsanto for nearly 37 years.  He was a participant in the Monsanto Company Salaried Employees Pension Plan (\"1986 Plan\").  The 1986 Plan offered several options to retirees, including the option to receive various types of periodic payments (annuities) or to take all benefits in a lump sum.  In accordance with the requirements of the 1986 Plan, Vartanian submitted a lump sum distribution request at least one year prior to his anticipated early retirement date.  Vartanian submitted this request in March, 1990 for an anticipated early retirement date of May 1, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February, 1991, Vartanian started to hear rumors that Monsanto was going to offer a more favorable early retirement package as a retirement incentive in the near future.  Monsanto had a history of using early retirement incentive programs, having done so in 1981, 1985 and 1990.  As rumors of early retirement offerings persisted, sometime in February or March, 1991, Vartanian asked his supervisor about the possibility of an early retirement offering and requested that the supervisor inquire about this possibility.  Several weeks later, Vartanian's supervisor responded that he could not confirm any rumors and that there were \"no plans\" regarding the early retirement offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April, 1991, Vartanian repeated the same inquiry to his supervisor who again responded that there were no plans regarding an early retirement arrangement.  Vartanian also questioned the Springfield Personnel Supervisor as to the possibility of an early retirement incentive offering and was told that there were no plans for any such offering.  The Springfield supervisor asked Vartanian if he would refrain from retiring on May 1, 1991 if such a program were available.  Vartanian responded that he would want to study any new program and certainly have the option of delaying the effective date of his early retirement, depending on the option.  Vartanian had in fact postponed a previously elected early retirement so he could work on certain projects for Monsanto.  Vartanian retired as of May 1, 1991, and took a lump sum distribution of approximately $509,000 under the 1986 Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about June 28, 1991, Monsanto's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan which involved consolidating manufacturing operations, closing plants, reorganizing businesses and reducing the number of employees.  As of February, 1991, when Vartanian made specific inquiries about early retirement incentive programs, Monsanto had, in fact, already given serious consideration to staff reductions and changes in the 1986 Pension Plan and was contemplating the formation of the Monsanto Special Voluntary Retirement Plan (\"1991 Plan\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vartanian alleges that he was denied a reasonable opportunity to make an informed decision about when to retire because Monsanto failed to disclose its consideration of an enhanced severance program.  If Vartanian had received complete and truthful information, he would have continued to work at Monsanto until December 1, 1991 and, thus, would have been eligible for full benefits under the 1991 Plan announced on June 28, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vartanian exhausted all administrative procedures and plan appeal procedures in his claim for benefits under the 1991 Plan.  Monsanto denied Vartanian's claim because he had retired on May 1, 1991 and, therefore, was not employed by Monsanto on October 1, 1991, which was a requirement for eligibility to participate in the 1991 Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the court below, Vartanian alleged that Monsanto breached its fiduciary duty in violation of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1104(a) by failing to disclose its intention to create a new, more generous retirement package or the fact that the company was giving \"serious consideration\" to such a plan.  Vartanian claimed that as a result of his reliance on Monsanto's misleading statements to the effect that the company did not intend to create a more generous retirement package, he missed the opportunity to retire under the more advantageous provisions of the new plan which went into effect shortly after his retirement.  Vartanian also alleged unlawful discrimination in violation of Section 510 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1140.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Section 502 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(a), only a \"participant\" or \"beneficiary\" may bring a private civil action.  Vartanian claims that he had standing to sue because he was a \"participant.\"   The district court found, however, that Vartanian was not a \"participant\" as defined by 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(7) of ERISA and thus, did not have standing to sue under Section 502.  Because Section 502 is the sole civil enforcement provision of ERISA, the district court dismissed both of Vartanian's ERISA claims.  The district court also dismissed Vartanian's common law claims alleging misrepresentation.  The court found that because these are state law claims which \"relate to\" ERISA, they are therefore preempted by Section 514(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1144(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Vartanian maintains that the district court erred in dismissing his claims.  Vartanian argues that, at the time Monsanto made the alleged misrepresentations, he was a \"participant\" in an employee benefit plan (the 1986 Plan), that Monsanto's breach of its fiduciary duty caused him to leave shortly before the 1991 Plan was adopted.  Furthermore, Vartanian claims that but for Monsanto's misrepresentations, he would be a \"participant\" in the 1991 Plan under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(7) and, as such, he has standing to assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unlawful discrimination and misrepresentation under ERISA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  He argues that the ERISA definition of \"participant\" refers to a person who is, or may become eligible for benefits \"from an employee benefits plan\" and does not require that the person be eligible for benefits from two employee benefit plans.  Thus, because he was a participant in the 1986 Plan, he claims that, it was not necessary that he be a participant in the 1991 Plan in order to have standing under ERISA.  In the alternative, Vartanian argues that, even if he does not have standing to assert claims under ERISA, this federal statute does not preempt his state common law claims and this case should be remanded to the district court for further proceedings to determine the merits of his common law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's decision to grant the motion to dismiss Vartanian's claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) de novo.

Sec. 1144(a) (emphasis added).  The Supreme Court has established that \"a law 'relates to' an employee benefit plan ... if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\"  Ingersoll-Rand, Co. v. McClendon, 498 U.S. 133, 139, 111 S.Ct. 478, 483, 112 L.Ed.2d 474 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Ingersoll-Rand, Co., the Supreme Court identified two tests for determining whether a cause of action \"relates to\" and is thus, preempted by ERISA.  First, a law is expressly preempted by ERISA where a plaintiff, in order to prevail, must plead, and the court must find, that an ERISA plan exists.  Id. at 140, 111 S.Ct. at 483.   The cause of action \"relates to\" an ERISA plan in this context because the court's inquiry must be directed to the plan.  Id.  Second, even where there is no express preemption, a cause of action is preempted if it conflicts directly with an ERISA cause of action.  Id. at 142, 111 S.Ct. at 484.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the existence of the 1991 Plan is inseparably connected to any determination of liability under state common law of misrepresentation.  There is simply no cause of action if there is no plan.  See id. at 140, 111 S.Ct. at 483.   The alleged misrepresentations by Monsanto relate to the existence of the 1991 Plan and in order to prevail under a state common law claim for misrepresentation, Vartanian would undoubtedly have to plead, and the Court would have to find, that the 1991 Plan exists.  See id. at 140, 111 S.Ct. at 483.   Thus, under the first test set forth in Ingersoll-Rand, Co., Vartanian's claims \"relate to\" an ERISA plan and are expressly preempted by ERISA.  See Smith v. Durham-Bush, Inc., 959 F.2d 6, 11-12 (2d Cir.1992);  see also Sanson v.

In order to establish that he or she \"may become eligible\" for benefits, a claimant must have a colorable claim that (1) he or she will prevail in a suit for benefits, or that (2) eligibility requirements will be fulfilled in the future.  \"This view attributes conventional meanings to the statutory language since all employees in covered employment and former employees with a colorable claim to vested benefits 'may become eligible.'   A former employee who has neither a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment nor a colorable claim to vested benefits, however, simply does not fit within the [phrase] 'may become eligible.' \"  Saladino v.

See Berlin v. Mich.  Bell Tel. Co., 858 F.2d 1154, 1163-64 (6th Cir.1988).  Vartanian's claims thus fall squarely within the \"zone of interests\" ERISA was designed to protect.

We believe, however, that given the broadly inclusive scope of the ERISA statute, and its preclusion of all other judicial recourse, it would be entirely consistent with the ERISA statute for this court to decline to bar Vartanian, for lack of \"standing\", from showing that, \"but for\" Monsanto's wrongful conduct, he would be a \"participant\" in the 1991 Plan.

Christopher, 950 F.2d at 1221.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching our conclusion, we rely on the fact that Vartanian did not know Monsanto had made misrepresentations to him and therefore, he could not have alleged a breach of fiduciary duty by Monsanto until after he had received payment under the 1986 Plan.  To hold otherwise would imply that when an employer breaches its fiduciary duty to an employee under ERISA, the employee would have standing to sue only if the employee finds out all of the facts constituting the breach prior to his receipt of retirement benefits.  Such a holding would enable an employer to defeat the employee's right to sue for a breach of fiduciary duty by keeping his breach a well guarded secret until the employee receives his benefits or, by distributing a lump sum and terminating benefits before the employee can file suit.  The employee would have no standing to state a claim under ERISA, even where the employer's breach of fiduciary duty takes the form of misrepresentations that induced the employee to retire and receive the payment of benefits.  Congress did not intend such unjust and arbitrary results.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is consistent with the Fifth Circuit's decision in Christopher, in which the court indicated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>it would seem ... logical to say that but for the employer's conduct alleged to be in violation of ERISA, the employee would be a current employee with a reasonable expectation of receiving benefits, and the employer should not be able through its own malfeasance to defeat the employee's standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Christopher, 950 F.2d at 1221.

Thus, Vartanian has standing to assert his claims under ERISA even though he has already received his benefits under the 1986 Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FEDERAL COMMON LAW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Vartanian requests that this court recognize a federal common law claim for misrepresentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this court has noted that Congress has contemplated that the federal courts \"in the interests of justice, would engage in interstitial lawmaking in ERISA cases in much the same way as the courts fashioned a federal common law of labor relations under section 301 of [the Labor Management Relations Act][,]\" Nash v.

Sec. 1001 et seq., pursuant to Section 502(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. 1132(a), as well as under common law,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> asserting that Monsanto breached its fiduciary duty and engaged in unlawful discrimination and misrepresentation.  The district court dismissed Vartanian's complaint for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), 822 F.Supp. 36.   Vartanian appeals the district court's dismissal of his claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the facts alleged by Vartanian, Vartanian worked for Monsanto for nearly 37 years.  He was a participant in the Monsanto Company Salaried Employees Pension Plan (\"1986 Plan\").  The 1986 Plan offered several options to retirees, including the option to receive various types of periodic payments (annuities) or to take all benefits in a lump sum.  In accordance with the requirements of the 1986 Plan, Vartanian submitted a lump sum distribution request at least one year prior to his anticipated early retirement date.  Vartanian submitted this request in March, 1990 for an anticipated early retirement date of May 1, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February, 1991, Vartanian started to hear rumors that Monsanto was going to offer a more favorable early retirement package as a retirement incentive in the near future.  Monsanto had a history of using early retirement incentive programs, having done so in 1981, 1985 and 1990.  As rumors of early retirement offerings persisted, sometime in February or March, 1991, Vartanian asked his supervisor about the possibility of an early retirement offering and requested that the supervisor inquire about this possibility.  Several weeks later, Vartanian's supervisor responded that he could not confirm any rumors and that there were \"no plans\" regarding the early retirement offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April, 1991, Vartanian repeated the same inquiry to his supervisor who again responded that there were no plans regarding an early retirement arrangement.  Vartanian also questioned the Springfield Personnel Supervisor as to the possibility of an early retirement incentive offering and was told that there were no plans for any such offering.  The Springfield supervisor asked Vartanian if he would refrain from retiring on May 1, 1991 if such a program were available.  Vartanian responded that he would want to study any new program and certainly have the option of delaying the effective date of his early retirement, depending on the option.  Vartanian had in fact postponed a previously elected early retirement so he could work on certain projects for Monsanto.  Vartanian retired as of May 1, 1991, and took a lump sum distribution of approximately $509,000 under the 1986 Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about June 28, 1991, Monsanto's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan which involved consolidating manufacturing operations, closing plants, reorganizing businesses and reducing the number of employees.  As of February, 1991, when Vartanian made specific inquiries about early retirement incentive programs, Monsanto had, in fact, already given serious consideration to staff reductions and changes in the 1986 Pension Plan and was contemplating the formation of the Monsanto Special Voluntary Retirement Plan (\"1991 Plan\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vartanian alleges that he was denied a reasonable opportunity to make an informed decision about when to retire because Monsanto failed to disclose its consideration of an enhanced severance program.  If Vartanian had received complete and truthful information, he would have continued to work at Monsanto until December 1, 1991 and, thus, would have been eligible for full benefits under the 1991 Plan announced on June 28, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vartanian exhausted all administrative procedures and plan appeal procedures in his claim for benefits under the 1991 Plan.  Monsanto denied Vartanian's claim because he had retired on May 1, 1991 and, therefore, was not employed by Monsanto on October 1, 1991, which was a requirement for eligibility to participate in the 1991 Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the court below, Vartanian alleged that Monsanto breached its fiduciary duty in violation of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1104(a) by failing to disclose its intention to create a new, more generous retirement package or the fact that the company was giving \"serious consideration\" to such a plan.  Vartanian claimed that as a result of his reliance on Monsanto's misleading statements to the effect that the company did not intend to create a more generous retirement package, he missed the opportunity to retire under the more advantageous provisions of the new plan which went into effect shortly after his retirement.  Vartanian also alleged unlawful discrimination in violation of Section 510 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1140.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Section 502 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(a), only a \"participant\" or \"beneficiary\" may bring a private civil action.  Vartanian claims that he had standing to sue because he was a \"participant.\"   The district court found, however, that Vartanian was not a \"participant\" as defined by 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(7) of ERISA and thus, did not have standing to sue under Section 502.  Because Section 502 is the sole civil enforcement provision of ERISA, the district court dismissed both of Vartanian's ERISA claims.  The district court also dismissed Vartanian's common law claims alleging misrepresentation.  The court found that because these are state law claims which \"relate to\" ERISA, they are therefore preempted by Section 514(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1144(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Vartanian maintains that the district court erred in dismissing his claims.  Vartanian argues that, at the time Monsanto made the alleged misrepresentations, he was a \"participant\" in an employee benefit plan (the 1986 Plan), that Monsanto's breach of its fiduciary duty caused him to leave shortly before the 1991 Plan was adopted.  Furthermore, Vartanian claims that but for Monsanto's misrepresentations, he would be a \"participant\" in the 1991 Plan under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1002(7) and, as such, he has standing to assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unlawful discrimination and misrepresentation under ERISA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  He argues that the ERISA definition of \"participant\" refers to a person who is, or may become eligible for benefits \"from an employee benefits plan\" and does not require that the person be eligible for benefits from two employee benefit plans.  Thus, because he was a participant in the 1986 Plan, he claims that, it was not necessary that he be a participant in the 1991 Plan in order to have standing under ERISA.  In the alternative, Vartanian argues that, even if he does not have standing to assert claims under ERISA, this federal statute does not preempt his state common law claims and this case should be remanded to the district court for further proceedings to determine the merits of his common law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's decision to grant the motion to dismiss Vartanian's claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) de novo.

First, a law is expressly preempted by ERISA where a plaintiff, in order to prevail, must plead, and the court must find, that an ERISA plan exists.  Id. at 140, 111 S.Ct. at 483.   The cause of action \"relates to\" an ERISA plan in this context because the court's inquiry must be directed to the plan.  Id.  Second, even where there is no express preemption, a cause of action is preempted if it conflicts directly with an ERISA cause of action.  Id. at 142, 111 S.Ct. at 484.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the existence of the 1991 Plan is inseparably connected to any determination of liability under state common law of misrepresentation.  There is simply no cause of action if there is no plan.  See id. at 140, 111 S.Ct. at 483.   The alleged misrepresentations by Monsanto relate to the existence of the 1991 Plan and in order to prevail under a state common law claim for misrepresentation, Vartanian would undoubtedly have to plead, and the Court would have to find, that the 1991 Plan exists.  See id. at 140, 111 S.Ct. at 483.   Thus, under the first test set forth in Ingersoll-Rand, Co., Vartanian's claims \"relate to\" an ERISA plan and are expressly preempted by ERISA.  See Smith v.

See Berlin v. Mich.  Bell Tel. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512620\"><a href=\"/opinion/512620/frank-m-berlin-87-1475-norbert-a-ogden-milton-a-hartman-james-k/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1154</span></a></span>, 1163-64 (6th Cir.1988).  Vartanian's claims thus fall squarely within the \"zone of interests\" ERISA was designed to protect.   See Astor, 7 F.3d at 538-39 (former employees who are within the zone of interests ERISA was intended to protect held to be \"participants\" for purposes of standing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the 1991 Plan had not yet been made available to Vartanian at the time of Monsanto's alleged misrepresentations nor at the time of Vartanian's retirement and thus, Vartanian could not technically be a \"participant\" in the 1991 Plan.  We believe, however, that given the broadly inclusive scope of the ERISA statute, and its preclusion of all other judicial recourse, it would be entirely consistent with the ERISA statute for this court to decline to bar Vartanian, for lack of \"standing\", from showing that, \"but for\" Monsanto's wrongful conduct, he would be a \"participant\" in the 1991 Plan.  Cf. Christopher, 950 F.2d at 1221.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching our conclusion, we rely on the fact that Vartanian did not know Monsanto had made misrepresentations to him and therefore, he could not have alleged a breach of fiduciary duty by Monsanto until after he had received payment under the 1986 Plan.  To hold otherwise would imply that when an employer breaches its fiduciary duty to an employee under ERISA, the employee would have standing to sue only if the employee finds out all of the facts constituting the breach prior to his receipt of retirement benefits.  Such a holding would enable an employer to defeat the employee's right to sue for a breach of fiduciary duty by keeping his breach a well guarded secret until the employee receives his benefits or, by distributing a lump sum and terminating benefits before the employee can file suit.  The employee would have no standing to state a claim under ERISA, even where the employer's breach of fiduciary duty takes the form of misrepresentations that induced the employee to retire and receive the payment of benefits.  Congress did not intend such unjust and arbitrary results.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is consistent with the Fifth Circuit's decision in Christopher, in which the court indicated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>it would seem ... logical to say that but for the employer's conduct alleged to be in violation of ERISA, the employee would be a current employee with a reasonable expectation of receiving benefits, and the employer should not be able through its own malfeasance to defeat the employee's standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Christopher, 950 F.2d at 1221.
