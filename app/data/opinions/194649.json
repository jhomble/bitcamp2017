We affirm.\n\n     Appellant  was  convicted   on  January  21,   1988,  of\n\nconspiracy and  possession with intent to distribute cocaine,\n\nin  violation  of  21    U.S.C.      846  and  841(a)(1)  and\n\n(b)(1)(B). The  offenses for which he  was convicted occurred\n\nin  August and  September  of 1987.     Appellant  filed  two\n\nmotions  for a new  trial.  Both were  denied by the district\n\ncourt.  This court affirmed the  denial of appellant's second\n\nmotion for a new trial. See  United States v. Uribe, 890 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n554  (1st  Cir.  1989).   On  July  14,  1988, appellant  was\n\nsentenced  to eleven years in prison and a ten-year period of\n\nsupervised release.\n\n     Appellant  filed  two separate  motions  pursuant  to 28\n\nU.S.C.   2255.  The district  court denied both motions.   On\n\nJune 15, 1992, appellant filed  a Motion for Judicial  Notice\n\nand Consideration of  Sentencing Modification.   The district\n\ncourt denied the motion  on the grounds that it  was untimely\n\nfiled  under Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 35(b).   Appellant  moved for\n\nreconsideration on the basis that  his motion was pursuant to\n\nFed.  R.  Crim. P.  35(a), which  imposes  no time  limits on\n\nfiling.   The  district court  denied appellant's  motion for\n\nreconsideration, finding  that the \"sentence  was within  the\n\n                             -3-\n\nrange of possible sentences provided by  law.\"  Uribe appeals\n\nfrom the denial of the last two motions.\n\n     Appellant's  motion, if  pursuant  to Fed.  R. Crim.  P.\n\n35(b),  was untimely filed.  Although former Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n35(a), applicable to offenses  committed prior to November 1,\n\n1987,  imposes no time limits on filing, it only provides for\n\nthe correction  of \"illegal\"  sentences.  Appellant  does not\n\nargue  that his  sentence  is illegal  within the  relatively\n\nnarrow meaning we have given  to that term in the context  of\n\nRule 35(a).  See,  e.g., United States v. Ames,  743 F.2d 46,\n                                              \n\n47 (1st Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1165 (1985).\n                                \n\n     Even if we construe  appellant's motion as made pursuant\n\nto 28  U.S.C.  2255,  we conclude that  appellant's arguments\n\nare without merit.  Appellant  concedes that he was sentenced\n\nwell within the statutory  limits for the crimes of  which he\n\nwas convicted.1   The general rule  with respect to  offenses\n\ncommitted  before November  1, 1987,  is that  \"the appellate\n\ncourt  has no  control over  a sentence  which is  within the\n\nlimits allowed  by a statute.\" United  States v. Ruiz-Garcia,\n                                                            \n\n886  F.2d 474, 476 (1st Cir. 1989) (citation omitted).  There\n\nis  a \"narrow band of exceptions\" to this rule. United States\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n1.    At the  time  of appellant's  offense, possession  with\nintent  to distribute  in excess  of 500  grams of  a mixture\ncontaining cocaine  carried a minimum sentence  of five years\nand a maximum sentence of forty years. 21 U.S.C.   841 (a)(1)\nand b(1)(B)(ii).   The maximum  term of imprisonment  for the\ncrime  of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to\ndistribute  was also forty years. 21 U.S.C.   846.\n\n                             -4-\n\nv.  Ponce  Federal  Bank, 883  F.2d  1,  5  (1st Cir.  1989).\n                        \n\nAppellant has failed  to show that his sentence  falls within\n\nthat band of exceptions. We address his arguments below.\n\n     Appellant first argues that  even though his offense was\n\ncommitted  prior to  November 1,  1987, 18  U.S.C.    3553(b)\n\nrequired  the  district  court  to  consider  the  Sentencing\n\nGuidelines  in sentencing  him and  to explain  any departure\n\ntherefrom.   We reject  this argument.   The Guidelines apply\n\nonly  to offenses  committed after  November 1,  1987. United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Uribe, 890 F.2d  at 563.   \"In this pre-Guidelines\n                \n\ncase, the district court was free to disregard the Guidelines\n\nand exercise  its sound  discretion in formulating  a condign\n\nsentence within the statutory limits.\" Id.  \n                                          \n\n     Appellant's  second argument  is  that  his sentence  is\n\n\"disproportionate\"  in violation  of  the Eighth  Amendment's\n\nprohibition  on cruel and unusual  punishment.  In support of\n\nthis  claim, he refers  to the lighter  sentences received by\n\nhis  co-defendants.    One co-defendant  received  concurrent\n\nseven-year  terms of  imprisonment  and a  four-year term  of\n\nsupervised   release.     The  other   co-defendant  received\n\nconcurrent nine-year terms of  imprisonment and an eight-year\n\nterm  of  supervised release.    Appellant  also relies  upon\n\nsentencing data appended to his presentence report indicating\n\nthat over a two-year period the average sentence  for persons\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nconvicted  of  similar crimes  was 71  months and  the median\n\nsentence was 60 months.\n\n     The  Supreme Court  has held  that the  Eighth Amendment\n\nrequires a  prison sentence to be proportionate  to the crime\n\nfor which  the defendant has  been convicted. Solem  v. Helm,\n                                                            \n\n463 U.S.  277, 289-90 (1983).  As we  have previously  noted,\n\nhowever,  the Court  also  advised reviewing  courts to  give\n\ngreat  deference to  the broad  authority of  legislatures in\n\ndetermining   sentencing  limits  and   of  trial  courts  in\n\nsentencing defendants. See United  States v. Glantz, 884 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1483, 1487  (1st  Cir. 1989),  cert.  denied, 493  U.S.  1086\n                                            \n\n(1990).  \"In view of this deference, successful challenges to\n\nthe   proportionality   of  particular   sentences   will  be\n\n'extremely rare.'\" Id. (citation omitted).\n                      \n\n     \"We  examine the sentence with  a view to  whether it is\n\ngrossly  disproportionate, considering the seriousness of the\n\noffense in relation to the harshness of the punishment.\" Tart\n                                                             \n\nv.  Massachusetts,  949  F.2d   490,  503  (1st  Cir.  1991).\n                 \n\nCompared  with  the  facts  of  Solem,  where  the  defendant\n                                     \n\nreceived  a sentence of  life imprisonment for  passing a bad\n\ncheck, the  sentence received  by appellant  is substantially\n\nless  harsh and the offense is far  more serious.  As we said\n\nin    Tart,   where   no    initial   inference    of   gross\n          \n\ndisproportionality can reasonably be  drawn, there is no need\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nto compare  the challenged  sentence with other  sentences in\n\nthis or other jurisdictions.  Id. n. 16.\n                                 \n\n     Even if we were to engage in such a comparison, however,\n\nappellant would  not prevail  on his Eighth  Amendment claim.\n\nThe statistics  attached to  his PSI  do not  demonstrate the\n\ngross  disproportionality  of  his  sentence.   There  is  no\n\nrequirement that  defendants receive a sentence  equal to the\n\naverage or median sentence imposed on defendants convicted of\n\nsimilar  offenses.     Moreover,  that  appellant's  sentence\n\nexceeded the  average and median sentences  does not indicate\n\nthat it is outside of the  range of sentences imposed for the\n\noffenses of which he  was convicted, or in any  other respect\n\ngrossly  disproportionate  to  those  offenses.  Nor  is  the\n\nappellant entitled  to precisely the same  sentence as others\n\nconvicted with him.  \n\n     United  States v.  Cannistraro, 871  F.2d 1210  (3d Cir.\n                                   \n\n1989), on which appellant relies, is distinguishable.  There,\n\nthe  court   held   that   appellant's   sentence   was   not\n\ndisproportionate  but  that his  \"right  to  be sentenced  on\n\naccurate and  reliable information\"  may have  been violated.\n\nThe  court  remanded  the  case to  the  district  court  for\n\nresentencing  if  the  court  relied  upon  statistical  data\n                \n\ncontained in the  PSI setting forth sentences  given to other\n\nfraud defendants, and if it misinterpreted the meaning of the\n                     \n\ndata.  There is no indication  in this case that the district\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\ncourt  misinterpreted  the   statistical  data  appended   to\n\nappellant's  PSI   or  that   it  relied  upon   that  data.2\n\nTherefore, there is  no showing that appellant's  right to be\n\nsentenced on accurate and reliable information was violated.\n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                    \n\n2.   The transcript of the sentencing hearing, if one exists,\nwas not filed with the district court.  Therefore, it was not\navailable for our review.  It is, of course, settled that the\nappellant  must bear the onus of  any uncertainty arising out\nof  an incomplete record on  appeal.  See  Real v. Hogan, 828\n                                                        \nF.2d 58, 60 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n",

P.\n\n35(a), applicable to offenses  committed prior to November 1,\n\n1987,  imposes no time limits on filing, it only provides for\n\nthe correction  of \"illegal\"  sentences.  Appellant  does not\n\nargue  that his  sentence  is illegal  within the  relatively\n\nnarrow meaning we have given  to that term in the context  of\n\nRule 35(a).  See,  e.g., United States v.

We address his arguments below.\n\n     Appellant first argues that  even though his offense was\n\ncommitted  prior to  November 1,  1987, 18  U.S.C.    3553(b)\n\nrequired  the  district  court  to  consider  the  Sentencing\n\nGuidelines  in sentencing  him and  to explain  any departure\n\ntherefrom.   We reject  this argument.   The Guidelines apply\n\nonly  to offenses  committed after  November 1,  1987. United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Uribe, 890 F.2d  at 563.   \"In this pre-Guidelines\n                \n\ncase, the district court was free to disregard the Guidelines\n\nand exercise  its sound  discretion in formulating  a condign\n\nsentence within the statutory limits.\" Id.  \n                                          \n\n     Appellant's  second argument  is  that  his sentence  is\n\n\"disproportionate\"  in violation  of  the Eighth  Amendment's\n\nprohibition  on cruel and unusual  punishment.  In support of\n\nthis  claim, he refers  to the lighter  sentences received by\n\nhis  co-defendants.    One co-defendant  received  concurrent\n\nseven-year  terms of  imprisonment  and a  four-year term  of\n\nsupervised   release.     The  other   co-defendant  received\n\nconcurrent nine-year terms of  imprisonment and an eight-year\n\nterm  of  supervised release.    Appellant  also relies  upon\n\nsentencing data appended to his presentence report indicating\n\nthat over a two-year period the average sentence  for persons\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nconvicted  of  similar crimes  was 71  months and  the median\n\nsentence was 60 months.\n\n     The  Supreme Court  has held  that the  Eighth Amendment\n\nrequires a  prison sentence to be proportionate  to the crime\n\nfor which  the defendant has  been convicted.

Helm,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111000\"><a href=\"/opinion/111000/solem-v-helm/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 289-90 (1983).  As we  have previously  noted,\n\nhowever,  the Court  also  advised reviewing  courts to  give\n\ngreat  deference to  the broad  authority of  legislatures in\n\ndetermining   sentencing  limits  and   of  trial  courts  in\n\nsentencing defendants.

As we said\n\nin    Tart,   where   no    initial   inference    of   gross\n          \n\ndisproportionality can reasonably be  drawn, there is no need\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nto compare  the challenged  sentence with other  sentences in\n\nthis or other jurisdictions.

There  is  no\n\nrequirement that  defendants receive a sentence  equal to the\n\naverage or median sentence imposed on defendants convicted of\n\nsimilar  offenses.     Moreover,  that  appellant's  sentence\n\nexceeded the  average and median sentences  does not indicate\n\nthat it is outside of the  range of sentences imposed for the\n\noffenses of which he  was convicted, or in any  other respect\n\ngrossly  disproportionate  to  those  offenses.  Nor  is  the\n\nappellant entitled  to precisely the same  sentence as others\n\nconvicted with him.  \n\n     United  States v.

There,\n\nthe  court   held   that   appellant's   sentence   was   not\n\ndisproportionate  but  that his  \"right  to  be sentenced  on\n\naccurate and  reliable information\"  may have  been violated.\n\nThe  court  remanded  the  case to  the  district  court  for\n\nresentencing  if  the  court  relied  upon  statistical  data\n                \n\ncontained in the  PSI setting forth sentences  given to other\n\nfraud defendants, and if it misinterpreted the meaning of the\n                     \n\ndata.  There is no indication  in this case that the district\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\ncourt  misinterpreted  the   statistical  data  appended   to\n\nappellant's  PSI   or  that   it  relied  upon   that  data.2\n\nTherefore, there is  no showing that appellant's  right to be\n\nsentenced on accurate and reliable information was violated.\n\n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                    \n\n2.
