This case began with a lawsuit by\n\ntwo Stoughton, Massachusetts, police officers alleging that town\n\nofficials and two officers who served as chiefs of police of the\n\ntown retaliated against the plaintiff officers for cooperating with\n\nan investigation into police misconduct and for disclosing a\n\nhostile work environment at the police department.                   Following\n\ngrants of summary judgment and directed verdicts by the district\n\ncourt, and a jury verdict on several remaining claims against one\n\nof the defendants, the defendants prevailed on each and every\n\nclaim.   The plaintiff officers now appeal.\n\n           Stoughton    (\"the    Town\")    is    governed   by   a   board   of\n\nselectmen (\"the Board\") that appoints both the town manager and the\n\nchief of police.       In June 2004, the then board members, by a\n\ndivided vote, failed to reappoint the then chief of police, Manuel\n\nCachopa.   David Chamberlin, until then serving as one of several\n\npolice lieutenants, had earlier submitted his retirement papers\n\neffective in July 2004, but he agreed at the Board's request to\n\nserve as interim chief and withdrew his retirement application. He\n\nheld the interim chief position until the Board hired a replacement\n\nchief, Joseph Saccardo, in October 2004 and then reverted to his\n\nlieutenant position.\n\n           In July 2004, Chamberlin learned of allegations that\n\nseveral police officers, including Cachopa, had engaged in criminal\n\nmisconduct.    Chamberlin       informed   the    Norfolk   County    District\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fAttorney, who appointed a special prosecutor in August.       During\n\nthis period Chamberlin met several times with the district attorney\n\nand the special prosecutor, joined on one occasion by a lieutenant,\n\nFrancis Wohlgemuth.     In October, at the special prosecutor's\n\nrequest, a number of officers were placed on leave, including\n\nCachopa.   A grand jury began to inquire into the matter and both\n\nChamberlin and Wohlgemuth testified before the grand jury in late\n\n2004.\n\n           After Cachopa was denied reappointment, a recall campaign\n\nwas begun to remove the board members who had opposed him.    In the\n\ntown election held in November 2004, those members were replaced by\n\ntwo new selectmen, Richard Levine and John Kowalczyk.        In mid-\n\nNovember, the new board ordered the suspended officers reinstated\n\nand then reappointed Cachopa as chief on November 24.        On his\n\nreturn Cachopa immediately made Christopher Ciampa, a sergeant and\n\nstrong supporter of Cachopa, his effective deputy, promoting him\n\nover the heads of the serving lieutenants.   In March 2005, Cachopa\n\nand two other officers were indicted, and the Board then made\n\nCiampa acting police chief.\n\n           In September 2006, Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth filed suit\n\nin federal district court against the Town, the Board, Cachopa,\n\nCiampa, and three selectmen (who also had supported Cachopa):\n\nLevine, Kowalczyk and Scott Carrara. The gist of the complaint was\n\nthat Cachopa and Ciampa, aided by the Board, had carried on in 2004\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fand 2005 a systematic campaign of retaliatory harassment against\n\nChamberlin, Wohlgemuth and other officers who had either opposed\n\nCachopa or remained neutral in the recall campaign.             One of those\n\nother officers, Sergeant Robert Welch, brought his own suit against\n\nCachopa, Ciampa and other defendants.            See Welch v. Ciampa, 542\n\nF.3d 927 (1st Cir. 2008) (reversing and remanding in part the\n\ndismissal of his claims).\n\n           Some of the actions alleged by Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth\n\nwere petty but a few were more serious; collectively, they arguably\n\nalleged enough harm to constitute a viable claim--assuming that the\n\nactions were taken for a purpose unlawful under federal or state\n\nlaw.   They included inconvenient changes of office and shift for\n\nthe two plaintiffs, depriving Wohlgemuth of access to many offices\n\nin the station, unjustified reprimands, imposing limitations on the\n\nplaintiffs' preexisting authority, requiring them to wear blue\n\nshirts instead of senior officer white and inflicting inappropriate\n\nmedical and other examinations on Chamberlin.\n\n           The connection of the defendants other than Cachopa and\n\nCiampa with these events was left obscure in the complaint save for\n\none episode involving other town officials.           In January 2005, the\n\nTown   threatened   to   sue   Chamberlin   if   he   neither   retired   nor\n\nreturned retirement incentive pay (allegedly totaling $21,000)\n\nwhich he had received after he initially agreed to retire.                The\n\nTown did in fact bring such a suit, abandoning it when Chamberlin--\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fout on vacation and then sick leave since November 2004--retired at\n\nthe end of March 2005.\n\n          The complaint alleged that the claimed harassment was\n\nretribution   for   a   set   of   specific   actions    by    Chamberlin   and\n\nWohlgemuth comprising speech assertedly protected under federal or\n\nstate law or both, specifically: (1) requesting in July 2004 that\n\nthe town manager investigate the operation of the department,\n\nincluding unequal discipline for those supporting and opposing\n\nCachopa; (2) cooperating with the special prosecutor and grand jury\n\nin fall and winter 2004; and (3) advising the town manager by\n\nletters of a hostile work environment at the police department in\n\nDecember 2004.\n\n          Several       different       statutes        were     invoked--the\n\nMassachusetts Whistleblower Statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, §\n\n185(b) (2009), the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, id. ch. 12, §\n\n11I, and the federal civil rights statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2006),\n\nbased on the First Amendment--together with a charge of abuse of\n\nprocess relating to the Town's lawsuit.         In addition to this final\n\ncommon law claim, each of three categories of protected speech was\n\nmade the subject of several different statutory claims and each was\n\nstated separately for each plaintiff--resulting in 17 counts.\n\nDifferent defendants appeared in the various counts.\n\n          Thereafter the case was narrowed in steps beginning with\n\nthe district court's dismissal of the Board.            Early on, the Board\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fwas dismissed on the ground that it was not subject to suit under\n\nthe Whistleblower Statute or § 1983 and, although the district\n\ncourt's order does not explain why, dismissal of the Massachusetts\n\nCivil    Rights   Act   claim   against       the    Board   was   also   granted;\n\nplaintiffs make no mention of this lack of explanation on their\n\npresent appeal so we need not pursue that issue.\n\n            On November 27, 2007, the court granted summary judgment\n\nfor the defendants on a number of counts, qualifying the order a\n\nweek later.       The remaining claims, then set for trial, were a\n\nsingle count under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act--Wohlgemuth's\n\nclaim against Cachopa based on his hostile work environment letter\n\nto the town manager--the Whistleblower statute claims of both\n\nplaintiffs against the Town, and their § 1983 claims based on their\n\nhostile work environment letters and of Chamberlin based on his\n\ngrand jury testimony and cooperation with the special prosecutor.\n\n            In the first trial, a mistrial was declared as to all\n\nclaims    against   Cachopa     after    plaintiffs'         counsel   improperly\n\nreferred to Cachopa's indictment.                   Then at the close of the\n\nplaintiffs' case, the district court, acting from the bench,\n\ngranted defendants' oral motions for a directed verdict as to all\n\nclaims against the remaining defendants.                 Asked to explain the\n\nbasis for the directed verdict, the district court invoked (with\n\none exception) \"all the reasons argued by the defense counsel and\n\nas expressed in their brief\"--a category containing a number of\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fdisparate contentions.1     The district court denied the plaintiffs'\n\nmotion for reconsideration and motion for a new trial.\n\n           A second trial then ensued on the remaining claims\n\nagainst Cachopa--plaintiffs' § 1983 claims based on the December\n\nhostile work environment letters, Wohlgemuth's Massachusetts Civil\n\nRights Act claim based on his letter, and Chamberlin's § 1983 claim\n\nbased on cooperation with the special prosecutor and grand jury--\n\nand the jury found in Cachopa's favor on all of the claims.         Before\n\nus now are appeals relating to the summary judgment and the\n\ndistrict court's rulings in both trials.        Denial of a separate new\n\ntrial motion in the second trial was appealed too late and is not\n\nbefore us.\n\n           Plaintiffs'     joint   principal    brief   asserts   that    the\n\ndistrict   court   erred   first   by     entering   summary   judgment    on\n\nspecified claims prior to the first trial and directing verdicts in\n\nthat trial and second by making a series of errors in the course of\n\nthe second trial.   Our review of the directed verdicts is de novo,\n\nAhern v. Scholz, 85 F.3d 774, 793 (1st Cir. 1996); review as to\n\nalleged trial errors depends upon the character and context of the\n\n\n     1\n      Those grounds included a lack of compensable damages, coupled\nwith a lack of evil motive or intent sufficient to award punitive\ndamages; the fact that many of the alleged retaliatory acts took\nplace prior to the December hostile work environment letters; a\nlack of knowledge by the defendants of the plaintiffs' grand jury\ntestimony; a lack of retaliatory acts by the Selectmen or Ciampa;\nand a lack of a policy or custom of retaliation by the Town. The\ndistrict court said, however, that it did not adopt in full the\ndefendants' reading of current First Amendment doctrine.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fruling, e.g.,         McDonough v. City of Quincy, 452 F.3d 8, 19 (1st\n\nCir.       2006)   (exclusion   of    evidence     reviewed   for    abuse    of\n\ndiscretion); O'Rourke v. City of Providence, 235 F.3d 713, 736 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (jury instructions reviewed for plain error where party\n\nhas not timely objected).\n\n              The most far-reaching of the issues centers around First\n\nAmendment protection vel non for plaintiffs' statements, and two\n\nsets of claims that depend on that premise: the § 1983 claims and\n\nthe parallel claims under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (which\n\nthe parties treat as subject to the same analysis, Hosford v. Sch.\n\nComm. of Sandwich, 659 N.E.2d 1178, 1180 n.5 (Mass. 1996)).                   To\n\nmake out a free speech claim under § 1983, the plaintiffs \"must\n\nshow that [they] engaged in constitutionally protected conduct and\n\nthat this conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the\n\nalleged adverse employment action.\"           Welch, 542 F.3d at 936.\n\n              First    Amendment     claims   of    this   kind     have     been\n\nconventional since the Supreme Court developed such a cause of\n\naction in the 1960s,2 and police officers who voice concerns about\n\nmisconduct and suffer for it have been plaintiffs in a number of\n\nsuch cases.        See, e.g., Tripp v. Cole, 425 F.3d 5 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nWagner v. City of Holyoke, 404 F.3d 504 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n\n\n       2\n      See, e.g., Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138 (1983); Mt. Healthy\nCity Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977);\nPickering v. Bd. of Educ. of Twp. High Sch. Dist. 205, 391 U.S. 563\n(1968).\n\n                                       -9-\n\f546 U.S. 977 (2005); Bennett v. City of Holyoke, 362 F.3d 1 (1st\n\nCir. 2004); Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dep't, 315 F.3d 65 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).        It is unclear how far such claims can survive the\n\nSupreme Court's recent decision in Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S.\n\n410, 421 (2006), which ruled that “when public employees make\n\nstatements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not\n\nspeaking     as    citizens   for   First   Amendment   purposes,   and   the\n\nConstitution does not insulate their communications from employer\n\ndiscipline.”\n\n             Virtually all of the \"protected conduct\" relied on by the\n\nplaintiffs was speech-related activity that arguably was done\n\n\"pursuant to their official duties\"; but it is unclear how far the\n\nSupreme Court intends to carry Garcetti, and the Massachusetts\n\nWhistleblower Statute offers quite similar protection unaffected by\n\nGarcetti.3        Although the First Amendment (implemented through §\n\n1983 or the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act) differs from the\n\nWhistleblower Statute in many incidents, the core difficulty in\n\nthis case is common to both: the difficulty of proving that Cachopa\n\n\n     3\n      The Whistleblower Statute imposes liability on the state,\nlocal towns, and other public entities that retaliate against an\nemployee through \"adverse employment action\" for specified conduct,\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 185(a), (b); and the protected conduct,\nsubject to certain conditions, includes--to paraphrase two of the\nsubsections that follow: (1) disclosing to a supervisor or \"public\nbody\" activity by the employer that the complaining employee\nbelieves to be unlawful or dangerous; and (2) providing information\nor testimony to a \"public body\" conducting an investigation into\nunlawful conduct or a threat to safety. Id. ch. 149, § 185(b).\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fand Ciampa took various of their actions in order to retaliate for\n\nprotected activity.\n\n            The Stoughton Police Department was surely in turmoil in\n\nthe 2004-2005 period.         In a relatively brief window, the chief\n\nposition was held by Cachopa, Chamberlin, Saccardo, Cachopa again\n\nand then Ciampa who was closely allied with Cachopa.         Cachopa was\n\nhimself ultimately convicted in 2009 of being an accessory after\n\nthe fact to more serious misconduct of which another officer\n\n(Sergeant David Cohen) was convicted.4           Officers who had not\n\nsupported Cachopa or the recall campaign, including Chamberlin and\n\nWohlgemuth, seem to have been subject to harassment after Cachopa\n\nregained authority and during Ciampa's tenure.\n\n            But it remained the plaintiffs' task to establish that\n\nCachopa, Ciampa or both took adverse action against one or both of\n\nthe plaintiffs motivated at least in part by their protected\n\nconduct, and in this respect the plaintiffs' case rested primarily\n\non soft inference as against flat denials by both the defendant\n\nofficers.    In particular, plaintiffs had no direct proof that\n\neither of the two defendant officers knew that Chamberlin had\n\ninstigated    the   special    prosecutor's   inquiry   or   that   either\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court later reversed\nCohen's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial, on the\ngrounds that the trial court had violated Cohen's right to a public\ntrial by restricting access to the courtroom during jury selection.\nCommonwealth v. Cohen, 919 N.E.2d 628 (Mass. 2010).\n\n                                    -11-\n\fplaintiff had testified to the grand jury, and both defendants\n\ndenied knowing about who testified before the grand jury.\n\n           Further,     certain   of   the   small   administrative    steps\n\ncomplained of by the plaintiffs could be taken as hostile or\n\ndefended as consistent with regulations, so it is not easy to work\n\nbackwards and conclusively infer a malign motive from the acts\n\nthemselves.     Other    problems      included    the   uncertainty   as   to\n\nsignificant compensable harm, lack of medical evidence of emotional\n\nharm, and the fact that Chamberlin was on leave during most of the\n\nevents.   This, then, looks like a suitable case for a jury to sort\n\nout cause, motive and effect; and when the jury got the claims\n\nagainst Cachopa, it rejected them on the merits.\n\n           It is true that the district court let the case against\n\nCachopa go to the jury in the second trial while it directed a\n\nverdict in Ciampa's favor in the first.           But Cachopa was the chief\n\nwhen the principal incidents occurred; Ciampa was his creature as\n\nhis effective deputy promoted to that spot over the heads of the\n\nlieutenants; and the most plausible case against both rested on the\n\nnotion that they were cooperating to inflict petty misery on the\n\nplaintiffs, one of whom had supplanted Cachopa and the other of\n\nwhom had failed to support him.\n\n           The jury in the second trial was allowed to consider\n\npractically all of the claimed acts of retaliation.             A number of\n\nthese acts were done by Cachopa directly (changing the plaintiffs'\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fshift and shirt colors; appointing Ciampa as executive officer over\n\nthe   heads    of     the     lieutenants    and    reducing    the   plaintiffs'\n\nresponsibilities; sending Chamberlin letters demanding doctor's\n\nnotes).    Others were, by Cachopa's own admission, done at his\n\ndirection by his deputy, Ciampa (moving Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth\n\nto a different office; imposing various restrictions on Chamberlin\n\nfor not requalifying with his firearm).              A few acts were presented\n\nto the jury without clear evidence as to whether Cachopa or Ciampa\n\nwas the primary actor (changing plaintiffs' training locations).\n\n              In other words, for almost all the acts of alleged\n\nretaliation, Cachopa was either the principal actor or at least as\n\nculpable as Ciampa.          Nonetheless, the jury found that Cachopa did\n\nnot retaliate against the plaintiffs for protected conduct.                    The\n\njury's    determination         that   Cachopa      was   not   liable   \"fatally\n\neviscerated\"        the     plaintiffs'    claims    against    Ciampa   and   the\n\ndefendants from the Town.          Earle v. Benoit, 850 F.2d 836, 845 (1st\n\nCir. 1988).5        Earle is not conclusive--the fatal determination\n\nthere was in the same trial--but the principle is the same, namely,\n\n\n\n\n      5\n      Earle is far from the only example. See, e.g., Goulet v. New\nPenn Motor Express, Inc., 512 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir. 2008); Senra v.\nCunningham, 9 F.3d 168, 174 (1st Cir. 1993); Dixon v.

American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848, 855\n(9th Cir. 1977).\n\n                                          -13-\n\fthat courts do not have further proceedings based on harmless\n\nerrors.\n\n           Appellate review after the grant of a directed verdict\n\nusually involves a measure of speculation about how the jury would\n\nhave   decided   if   a   directed   verdict    had    been   denied;   but    no\n\nspeculation is needed here because the same claims were effectively\n\ntried and lost in the second case.          This is a rare occurrence and\n\nperhaps without precedent; but that should hardly prevent us from\n\nexercising common sense.       Yes, the Seventh Amendment provides for\n\njury   trials;   but,     directed   verdicts    and    harmless   error      are\n\nestablished qualifications (so too are waiver, stipulation and\n\nestoppel).   Whether the case against Ciampa was fairly tested by\n\nthe second trial is a separate question.\n\n           A few alleged retaliatory acts--for which Ciampa and the\n\nTown were the primary actors--were not squarely presented to the\n\njury in the second trial.        After Ciampa became acting chief, he\n\ndirected Chamberlin to undergo a medical examination to determine\n\nhis fitness to return to duty; issued warnings to Wohlgemuth for\n\ncomments made to other officers; and sent Wohlgemuth a letter about\n\nsick time abuse.      These incidents not only fail as a retaliation\n\nclaim, cf. Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209, 1218\n\n(1st Cir. 1989) (en banc), but add no real weight to the more\n\nserious incidents that occurred while Cachopa was chief.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f          Thus,   the medical examination was required for officers\n\nout of work for five days or more due to off-duty injury or\n\nillness, and the dispute centered around a possible conflict of the\n\npolicy with the union contract; Wohlgemuth did not seriously deny\n\nmaking some negative comments about other officers; and whether he\n\nmarginally exceeded his sick time is unclear even after reading\n\nrelevant testimony. By contrast, the list of alleged wrongful acts\n\noccurring while Cachopa was chief is far longer and included at\n\nleast a few of some substance.6       This is presumably why the court\n\ndid not direct a verdict for Cachopa; even so, Cachopa prevailed.\n\n          As for the Town, it was within its rights in filing suit\n\nagainst Chamberlin over his retirement incentive.        Chamberlin did\n\nnot retire as promised for whatever reason, and the Board could\n\nlegitimately seek to enforce the agreement; engaging in protected\n\nconduct did not insulate Chamberlin from these consequences.          See\n\nBlackie v. Maine, 75 F.3d 716, 723-24 (1st Cir. 1996).         According\n\nto Chamberlin's own testimony, the Board's desire that he retire\n\npredated much of the arguably protected conduct.\n\n          Nowhere   do   plaintiffs    explain   how   they   could   have\n\nprevailed against Ciampa when the jury rejected counterpart claims\n\n\n     6\n      The ones of some arguable substance included Cachopa's\naltering of Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth shifts; Cachopa's appointment\nof Ciampa; and several other actions taken by Ciampa but seemingly\nat Cachopa's direction: a requirement that Chamberlin requalify to\ncarry firearms and confinement to station until this occurred; a\nreduction in Wohlgemuth's duties; and an official reprimand in\nChamberlin's personnel file.\n\n                                -15-\n\fagainst Cachopa.          Instead, they argue that the second trial was\n\nitself flawed: of their twelve claims in this court, eight assert\n\nerrors in the second trial.                 Of course, the outcome of the second\n\ntrial could not insulate defendants if it were itself flawed; but\n\na number of the claims involve trial-court judgment calls about\n\nwhich little need be said and the most important of the challenged\n\nrulings--discussed next--do not comprise reversible error.\n\n             Most important, plaintiffs argue that the district court\n\nerred   by   excluding       a    report      that   the   Town      commissioned       from\n\nattorney     Marc    Terry       (the   \"Terry      Report\")    in    response     to    the\n\nplaintiffs' letters alleging a hostile work environment.                             Terry\n\ninterviewed     a    number       of    witnesses     regarding       the    plaintiffs'\n\nallegations and concluded that Cachopa had retaliated against the\n\nplaintiffs      both      for     their      cooperation    with      the    grand      jury\n\ninvestigation and for failing to support Cachopa's effort to remain\n\nas chief.\n\n             In excluding the report, the district court stated, \"I\n\nthink given its timing and given the fact that it was requested in\n\nJuly of 2004 and we don't get it until October of 2005 . . . .\n\n[and]   given       its   level        of    generality,    I     think     it's   unduly\n\nprejudicial.\"        The reference to timing is unclear to us and the\n\nreference to generality is perhaps confusing; the report was fairly\n\ndetailed as to the underlying events.                   But in all likelihood the\n\ndistrict court meant that the utility of the report to plaintiffs\n\n\n                                             -16-\n\fwas its final assessment, which their brief underscores, that\n\nCachopa was not credible in his denials as to what he did and why.\n\n           Cachopa's credibility as to what he did and why was\n\ncentral to the second trial, but the underlying evidence of events\n\nbearing on that was available to the plaintiffs.              To superimpose\n\nTerry's evaluation on what the jury was expected to decide served\n\nno useful purpose: it was the jury's task to decide whether to\n\nbelieve Cachopa.    Terry was not qualified or offered as an expert\n\non \"credibility\"; and to treat his independent judgment as evidence\n\nwould    simply   weight     one   side    of   the   scale   to   Cachopa's\n\ndisadvantage.\n\n         It thus does not matter whether Terry's report avoids a\n\nhearsay objection by virtue of Rule 803(8)(c) or otherwise;7 Rule\n\n403 independently permits exclusion of evidence that is unduly\n\nprejudicial and to exclude the report on this ground was not an\n\nabuse of discretion.       This would be a different case if plaintiffs\n\nwere pointing us to raw facts that Terry had uncovered and for\n\nwhich evidence was not readily available to plaintiffs themselves.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(c) creates a hearsay\nexception for reports of \"public offices or agencies, setting forth\n. . . factual findings resulting from an investigation made\npursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of\ninformation    or   other    circumstances    indicate   lack    of\ntrustworthiness.\"   The plaintiffs also cite Rule 801(d)(2)(C),\nwhich covers statements by authorized persons, and Rule\n801(d)(2)(D), which covers statements by agents.\n\n                                    -17-\n\f               The plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred\n\nby refusing to allow them to examine Cachopa over his role in the\n\ninitial investigation of Cohen, whose conduct was the subject of\n\nthe    later    inquiry    by    the    special   prosecutor       and   grand   jury\n\ninvestigation.       The plaintiffs claim that Cachopa opened the door\n\nto the issue by testifying that he himself had brought the matter\n\nbefore the district attorney in 2003, and that they were denied the\n\nchance to demonstrate fully Cachopa's misconduct in this matter.\n\n               However, the transcript indicates that the district court\n\ndid not flatly bar the plaintiffs from examining Cachopa on the\n\nCohen investigation.            Rather, Cachopa was the first witness to\n\ntestify in the case, and the district court seemingly believed that\n\nthe jury should first be apprised of any wrongs that Cachopa did to\n\nthe plaintiffs before digressions into Cachopa's role in the Cohen\n\nmatter.      The court ruled that \"[y]ou better go to something that's\n\nrelevant and then you can come back to this.                 You can come back to\n\nit . . . if it's relevant.\"              The plaintiffs tried again several\n\nquestions later, in response to which the court sustained an\n\nobjection       \"without    prejudice      to     your     returning     to   it.\"\n\n               So far as appears, the plaintiffs made no effort to\n\nquestion Cachopa on the Cohen matter again.                 The Cohen matter, and\n\nCachopa's conduct in relation to it, was arguably \"relevant\" under\n\nRule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence--for example, because it\n\nbore    on   his   motivation      to    retaliate       against   Chamberlin    for\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\fprompting an inquiry into the matter.                       But the district court\n\n\"enjoy[s] wide latitude in matters concerning the ordering of proof\n\nand the presentation of evidence,\" Morales Feliciano v. Rullan, 378\n\nF.3d 42, 57 (1st Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1054 (2005),\n\nand plaintiffs were free to return to the Cohen matter after they\n\nadduced    evidence    that     Cachopa          had   taken    steps    against    the\n\nplaintiffs for which his motive was relevant.\n\n            The plaintiffs next argue that the district court erred\n\nby instructing the jury to determine whether the plaintiffs'\n\nDecember    7   letters   alleging          a    hostile     work    environment    were\n\nprotected    conduct    under    the        \"matters    of     public    concern\"   and\n\ninterest-balancing tests used by the Supreme Court, at least prior\n\nto the exception now carved out by Garcetti.                        Whether speech is\n\nconstitutionally protected is ordinarily a matter for the judge,\n\nnot the jury;8 but the plaintiffs did not object to this aspect of\n\nthe jury instructions and so the objection is waived, absent plain\n\nerror--a    stiff      test     in     civil        cases,     see     Diaz-Seijo    v.\n\nFajardo-Velez, 397 F.3d 53, 56 (1st Cir. 2005), which plaintiffs do\n\nnot meet.\n\n            The   plaintiffs         also       challenge    the     district   court's\n\nfailure to instruct the jury that the plaintiffs' cooperation with\n\n\n     8\n      Connick, 461 U.S. at 148 n.7 (\"The inquiry into the protected\nstatus of speech is one of law, not fact.\"); Curran v. Cousins, 509\nF.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"[I]t is the judge who decides as a\nmatter of law the issues in the two steps Garcetti identifies.\");\nLewis v. City of Boston, 321 F.3d 207, 219 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                        -19-\n\fthe special prosecutor was protected under the First Amendment.\n\nAs two senior officers in the police department, it was within the\n\nscope of both plaintiffs' duties to cooperate with the district\n\nattorney    and    the   special     prosecutor     in    investigating      alleged\n\ncriminal activity within the police department.                  Wohlgemuth shared\n\nresponsibility for internal investigations, and Chamberlin had\n\nlaunched the investigation as part of his duties as chief.                         The\n\ndistrict court correctly ruled that this conduct was not protected\n\nby the First Amendment under Garcetti.\n\n            We are not suggesting that Garcetti applies every time a\n\npolice   officer      has     conversations       with    a   prosecutor.         What\n\nconstitutes       official     duties     will    necessarily     vary     with    the\n\ncircumstances including the rank of the officer, his areas of\n\nresponsibility and the nature of the conversations; but in this\n\ncase the facts just summarized are sufficient.                  The district court\n\nalso instructed the jury that cooperation with the grand jury was\n\nprotected     speech;       but    this   instruction,        being    favorable    to\n\nplaintiffs, is not before us and need not be addressed.\n\n            The district court also told the jury that the plaintiffs\n\npresented   \"no     medical       testimony\"     that    distinguished     emotional\n\ndistress based on \"protected speech from the other divisiveness in\n\nthe department,\" and \"you need such testimony.\"                       No per se rule\n\nrequires expert testimony for an award of compensatory damages\n\nbased on emotional distress, e.g., McDonough, 452 F.3d at 22, but\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\fif there was error, it was harmless.            The jury was told to award at\n\nleast nominal damages if a protected speech violation occurred and\n\ndid not do so--so the predicate for any damages was absent.\n\n              The remaining claims of trial error require no detailed\n\ndiscussion.         The plaintiffs are wrong that the district court\n\nprecluded proof of the shift changes and shirt color issue pressed\n\nby plaintiffs; the district court's restrictions on time allowed to\n\neach   side    were    within   the    district   court's   authority;   and   a\n\ncomplained     of     comment   by    the   district   court--itself   somewhat\n\nopaque--is not a basis for a new trial.\n\n              The judgment is affirmed.         Each side shall bear its own\n\ncosts on this appeal.\n\n              It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n                         -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\f             LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part.         Although the\n\nmajority affirms the district court's grant of a directed verdict9\n\nin favor of Ciampa, it does not do so on the familiar ground that\n\nno reasonable jury could find Ciampa liable for retaliation based\n\non   the    evidence   presented   at   the   first   trial.   Instead,   it\n\nconcludes that any error in the granting of the directed verdict\n\nfor Ciampa was \"harmless\" because of the rejection of plaintiffs'\n\nclaims against Cachopa by a different jury in a subsequent trial.\n\nIn my view, this harmless error analysis is unprecedented and\n\nunsupportable. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the decision\n\nto affirm the directed verdict in favor of Ciampa.10\n\n                                        I.\n\n             Because it is important for understanding the flaws in\n\nthe majority's harmless error analysis, I briefly summarize the\n\nrelevant procedural history. In January 2008, plaintiffs proceeded\n\nto trial on their retaliation claims against Ciampa, Cachopa, and\n\nother defendants.        Early in that trial, the court granted a\n\n\n\n      9\n       We note that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 was amended\nin 1991, and \"the term judgment as a matter of law was adopted to\nrefer to preverdict (directed verdict) and postverdict (judgment\nnotwithstanding the verdict) motions with a terminology that does\nnot conceal the common identity of two motions made at different\ntimes in the proceeding.\" Coastal Fuels of P.R., Inc. v. Carribean\nPetroleum Corp., 79 F.3d 182, 199 n.14 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). We refer to the district court's ruling\nas a directed verdict to remain consistent with the majority's\nterminology.\n      10\n           I join the majority's decision in all other respects.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fmistrial on all claims against Cachopa.        Plaintiffs continued to\n\npresent evidence against the remaining defendants. At the close of\n\ntheir case, the court granted a directed verdict on all claims\n\nagainst Ciampa and the remaining defendants. Following the court's\n\ndenial of plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration and for new trial,\n\nplaintiffs appealed.     Several weeks later, plaintiffs proceeded to\n\ntrial on their retaliation claims against Cachopa.            Plaintiffs'\n\nallegations   against    Cachopa,   although   overlapping    with   their\n\nallegations against Ciampa, were not identical.      The jury returned\n\na verdict for Cachopa, and plaintiffs appealed from that verdict.\n\nPlaintiffs' two appeals, from the dispositions in the first and\n\nsecond trials, were later consolidated in the proceeding now before\n\nus.\n\n                                    II.\n\n          We review de novo the district court's decision to grant\n\na directed verdict.     Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hernández, 447 F.3d\n\n115, 121 (1st Cir. 2006).     The district court could properly grant\n\na directed verdict for Ciampa at the close of plaintiffs' case in\n\nthe first trial only if, based on the evidence presented at the\n\ntime of its ruling, \"a reasonable jury would not have a legally\n\nsufficient evidentiary basis to find for [plaintiffs].\"            Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 50(a).   In our review of the grant of a directed verdict,\n\nwe apply the same standard as the district court.            Id.   We must\n\n\"examine the evidence and all fair inferences in the light most\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\ffavorable to the plaintiff[s] and may not consider the credibility\n\nof witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the\n\nweight of the evidence.\"     Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nViewing the evidence in this light, we may uphold the directed\n\nverdict for Ciampa only if no reasonable jury could find defendant\n\nliable based on the evidence presented by plaintiffs at the first\n\ntrial.   See Acevedo-Feliciano, 447 F.3d at 121.\n\n           In   order   to   prevail   on   their   retaliation   claims,\n\nplaintiffs had to show that they \"engaged in constitutionally\n\nprotected conduct and that this conduct was a substantial or\n\nmotivating factor in the alleged adverse employment action.\" Welch\n\nv. Ciampa, 542 F.3d 927, 936 (1st Cir. 2008).              The majority\n\nacknowledges that plaintiffs engaged in arguably constitutionally\n\nprotected conduct, that the adverse actions by Cachopa and Ciampa,\n\nviewed collectively, were arguably harmful enough to support a\n\nviable claim, that the parties proffered conflicting evidence as to\n\nmotive, and that this was \"a suitable case for the jury to sort out\n\ncause, motive and effect.\"         However, having recognized these\n\ncentral disputes suitable for jury determination, the majority does\n\nnot then evaluate the directed verdict on the merits, assessing\n\nwhether a reasonable jury could find Ciampa liable based on the\n\nevidence presented at the first trial. Instead, the majority looks\n\nto the second trial, in which Ciampa was not a party, and views\n\nthat trial as a proxy for what would have happened if plaintiffs'\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fclaims had gone to the jury in the first trial.               The majority\n\nconcludes that even if the district court erred in directing a\n\nverdict    for   Ciampa,   any   error   was   harmless,   because   similar\n\nretaliation claims against Cachopa went to a jury in the second\n\ntrial and that jury ultimately found in his favor.             None of the\n\nparties raised this harmless error argument in their briefing.11\n\nThat is not surprising.           There is no precedent for such an\n\napplication of harmless error.\n\n            As a general matter, under the harmless error rule, we\n\ndisregard \"errors or defects which do not affect the substantial\n\nrights of the parties.\"      28 U.S.C. § 2111; see also Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n61.   In the ordinary harmless error case, an error made in the\n\nproceedings leading up to the final judgment -- for example, an\n\nerroneous evidentiary ruling -- is deemed harmless to the ultimate\n\ndisposition.\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        Instead, defendants contended in their briefing, in the\ntraditional manner, that no reasonable jury could find for\nplaintiffs on their retaliation claims based on the evidence\npresented at the first trial, and therefore the directed verdict\nwas properly granted. Defendants contended, inter alia, that there\nwas no evidence Ciampa or Cachopa knew that plaintiffs cooperated\nwith the special prosecutor or testified before the grand jury, and\nthat any retaliation that occurred after plaintiffs' December 2004\nhostile work environment letters did not rise to the level of an\nadverse employment action. The only suggestion by defendants of an\nargument even resembling the majority's harmless error analysis is\ntheir statement, in a footnote, that \"the jury verdict in Cachopa's\nfavor in Trial Two further supports the reasonableness of the\nCourt's entry of a Directed Verdict in Trial One.\"\n\n                                    -25-\n\f            In certain narrow factual circumstances, courts have\n\nconcluded that an error in the final disposition -- for example, an\n\nerroneous directed verdict -- was harmless in light of subsequent\n\nproceedings.      For example, in Earle v. Benoit, 850 F.2d 836, 840\n\n(1st Cir. 1988), the primary authority relied on by the majority\n\nfor its harmless error analysis, the plaintiff, Earle, alleged that\n\ndefendant police officers had conspired to deprive him of his civil\n\nrights by subjecting him to unlawful arrest, illegal searches,\n\nexcessive force, and other harassment.            At the close of Earle's\n\ncase before the jury, the court directed a verdict in favor of\n\ndefendants on Earle's conspiracy claim, but permitted his other\n\nclaims to go to the jury.         Id. at 837.       That jury ultimately\n\nreturned a verdict for defendants, responding negatively to special\n\njury questions regarding whether the alleged unlawful arrest,\n\nillegal searches, and use of excessive force violated Earle's civil\n\nrights.   Id. at 845.\n\n            The Earle court concluded that the directed verdict was\n\nerroneously granted because \"there was sufficient circumstantial\n\nevidence (had the jury found in Earle's favor on the substantive\n\nclaims) for a reasonable jury to have inferred a conspiracy.\"           Id.\n\nat 844.     Nevertheless, this error was harmless because a § 1983\n\nconspiracy requires an \"actual deprivation of a right secured by\n\nthe Constitution and laws,\" and therefore the jury's ultimate\n\nrejection    of   Earle's   underlying    civil   rights   claims   \"fatally\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\feviscerated Earle's conspiracy claim.\"                Id. at 845 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).12        The court reasoned that, in a real and\n\npractical sense, even if the district court had permitted Earle's\n\nconspiracy claim to go to the jury, that claim would have been\n\nrejected by the jury.      Given the jury's findings on Earle's claims\n\nof significant civil rights violations, the jury could not have\n\nalso found defendants liable for a civil rights conspiracy.                   Id.\n\nMoreover,    \"as   a   practical    matter,\"    in    light   of   the   jury's\n\nconsistent    rejection   of   Earle's      civil    rights   claims,    it   was\n\n\"inconceivable\" that \"the jury would have found for plaintiff on\n\nthe closely related conspiracy charge.\"              Id.; see also Goulet v.\n\nNew Penn Motor Express, Inc., 512 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(finding    wrongly    directed    verdict   harmless    \"where    the   jury's\n\nultimate verdict necessarily defeats the claim\" on which directed\n\nverdict was erroneously granted (emphasis added)).13\n\n\n     12\n       The court acknowledged that Earle provided evidence of other\nmore trivial confrontations with police, such as being stopped for\nalleged traffic violations, but concluded that no jury could have\nfound that any of these incidents constituted a deprivation of a\nconstitutional right, as required for a § 1983 civil rights\nconspiracy. Id. at 845.\n     13\n       My research has uncovered a smattering of other cases, from\nour own circuit and others, applying harmless error analysis to a\ndirected verdict. Like Earle, these decisions have found harmless\nerror where the jury verdict \"necessarily defeats the claim\" on\nwhich a directed verdict was incorrectly granted. Goulet, 512 F.3d\nat 43; see id. at 42-43 (concluding that any error in directed\nverdict for employer on plaintiff's hybrid Labor Management\nRelations Act § 301 claim was harmless, where the jury's ultimate\nrejection of plaintiff's § 301 claim against union was \"fatal\" to\nclaim against employer); see also, e.g., Uphoff-Figueroa v.\n\n                                     -27-\n\f            As    I   explain   more    fully   below,   this     case   is\n\nfundamentally different from Earle for two reasons.             First, the\n\ndirected verdict for Ciampa and the jury verdict for Cachopa\n\noccurred not in a single trial, but in two separate trials that\n\nculminated in two separate appeals.       Second, given the nature of\n\nplaintiffs' claims and the particular facts of this case, the jury\n\nverdict for Cachopa did not necessarily defeat plaintiffs' claims\n\nagainst Ciampa.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          In Earle, as noted, the directed verdict and the ultimate\n\njury verdict occurred in the course of a single trial proceeding.\n\nThus, the Earle court concluded that given the jury's findings on\n\n\n\nAlejandro, No. 08-1921, 2010 WL 728784, at *7 (1st Cir. Mar. 4,\n2010) (holding that even if court erred in directing verdict for\nemployer on plaintiff's state law retaliation claim, it was\nharmless given the jury's finding for employer on \"identical\"\nfederal law retaliation claim); Snyder v. Ag Trucking, Inc., 57\nF.3d 484, 491 (6th Cir. 1995) (holding that directing a verdict for\nemployer on claim for willful violation of ADEA was harmless error\nbecause, given jury's rejection of underlying ADEA claim, it \"could\nnot\" have found willful violation of ADEA); Dixon v. City of\nLawton, Okla., 898 F.2d 1443, 1449 (10th Cir. 1990) (finding any\nerror in failing to submit § 1983 claim to jury harmless, given\njury's conclusion that no defendants violated plaintiff's\nconstitutional rights by use of excessive force); Mello v. K-Mart\nCorp., 792 F.2d 1228, 1231 (1st Cir. 1986) (concluding that error\nin directing verdict for manufacturer was harmless where jury\nultimately rejected product liability claims against vendor, and in\nreaching that verdict jury necessarily had to find that there was\nno manufacturing defect); Cenco Inc. v. Seidman & Seidman, 686 F.2d\n449, 453 (7th Cir. 1982) (holding that any error in directing\nverdict for defendant on plaintiff's claim for conspiracy to\ndefraud was harmless, given that jury ultimately rejected\nunderlying fraud claim).\n\n                                 -28-\n\fEarle's underlying civil rights claims, that jury could not have\n\nrationally found for Earle on his conspiracy claim.        Here, of\n\ncourse, the directed verdict on plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa\n\nand the jury's rejection of plaintiffs' claims against Cachopa\n\noccurred during two separate trial proceedings, which culminated in\n\nseparate dispositions and separate appeals.    In the first trial,\n\nfollowing the court's grant of a mistrial on all claims against\n\nCachopa, the court directed a verdict on all remaining claims\n\nagainst Ciampa and the other defendants. Thus, none of plaintiffs'\n\nclaims reached a jury in the first trial.     In the second trial,\n\nplaintiffs' claims against Cachopa were tried by a jury, and that\n\njury found for Cachopa.\n\n          Although the majority glosses over this somewhat odd\n\nprocedural history, it cannot be ignored.     Here, unlike in Earle\n\nand similar cases, we cannot say with any certainty how the first\n\njury would have decided plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa if the\n\ndirected verdict had not been granted, because that jury made no\n\nfindings on any of plaintiffs' claims. Without any findings by the\n\nfirst jury, we have no basis for concluding that the first jury\n\ncould not have rationally found for plaintiffs on their claims\n\nagainst Ciampa.   We cannot say, as the Earle court did, that if the\n\ndistrict court had not granted the directed verdict, the jury\n\nnecessarily would have rejected plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa.\n\n\n\n\n                                -29-\n\f           My concerns with the majority's unique harmless error\n\nanalysis are further heightened by its constitutional implications.\n\nUnder the Seventh Amendment, plaintiffs have a right to a jury\n\ntrial on their claims for legal relief under § 1983.14           City of\n\nMonterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 709-10\n\n(1999). Of course, it is well-established that the proper grant of\n\na directed verdict does not offend a party's Seventh Amendment\n\nright to a jury trial.      Galloway v. United States, 319 U.S. 372,\n\n389 (1943); 9B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal\n\nPractice & Procedure § 2522 (3d ed. 2008).          The directed verdict\n\nprocedure is constitutional because a properly granted directed\n\nverdict \"only deprives the losing party of the possibility of an\n\nunreasonable     verdict,   a   possibility   not    protected   by   the\n\nConstitution.\"     Wright & Miller, supra, § 2522.         The analysis\n\napplied in Earle, although styled as a harmless error analysis, is\n\na variant on this principle.     The Earle court found that, in light\n\nof the jury's finding on the underlying civil rights claims, the\n\njury could not rationally find for plaintiff on his conspiracy\n\nclaim.    Thus, the court's decision to withdraw Earle's conspiracy\n\nclaim from the jury did not violate any right to a jury trial\n\n\n\n\n     14\n       The Seventh Amendment provides: \"In Suits at common law,\nwhere the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the\nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a\njury shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United\nStates, than according to the rules of the common law.\"\n\n                                  -30-\n\fbecause it only deprived Earle of the possibility of an irrational\n\nverdict.\n\n             Here, however, the majority does not hold, under either\n\nthe traditional directed verdict analysis or the Earle harmless\n\nerror analysis, that the directed verdict for Ciampa in the first\n\ntrial     only    deprived     plaintiffs    of    the    possibility      of   an\n\nunreasonable verdict at the hands of the first jury.                       On the\n\ncontrary,    the    majority    acknowledges      that   plaintiffs   presented\n\nevidence at the first trial that was arguably sufficient for the\n\njury    to   find    Ciampa     liable    for     retaliation.        In     these\n\ncircumstances, the decision not to allow plaintiffs' claims against\n\nCiampa to be heard by the jury, and to affirm the directed verdict\n\nin   favor   of    Ciampa,   implicates     plaintiffs'    Seventh    Amendment\n\nrights.\n\n                                      IV.\n\n             Even if the directed verdict for Ciampa and the jury\n\nverdict for Cachopa had occurred in the course of a single trial,\n\nEarle and similar cases would not support a finding of harmless\n\nerror here.        On the facts of this case, as set forth by the\n\nmajority, it is clear that the jury verdict for Cachopa did not\n\n\"necessarily defeat[]\" plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa.                  Goulet,\n\n512 F.3d at 43.      Instead, for a variety of reasons, a rational jury\n\ncould   logically     reject    plaintiffs'     retaliation    claims      against\n\n\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\fCachopa, but at the same time uphold plaintiffs' retaliation claims\n\nagainst Ciampa.15\n\n            For example, a rational jury could have reached different\n\nconclusions about Ciampa and Cachopa on the issue of motive.\n\nPlaintiffs' retaliation claims required a showing that Ciampa,\n\nCachopa, or both took adverse actions motivated at least in part by\n\nplaintiffs' protected conduct.             See Welch, 542 F.3d at 936.            The\n\ninquiry into motive is highly individualized and fact-specific,\n\nrequiring     an   evaluation       of    the    defendant    officers'    actual,\n\nsubjective intent.          See, e.g., Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz-Velez, 341\n\nF.3d 86, 97 (1st Cir. 2003) (explaining that \"subjective intent is\n\nan essential element\" of analogous political discrimination claim\n\nunder First Amendment).         As the majority acknowledges, there was a\n\ncentral   dispute      in    this   case    on    the   element   of     motive    --\n\nplaintiffs' case as to retaliatory motive \"rested primarily on soft\n\ninference as against flat denials\" by Ciampa and Cachopa, and in\n\nparticular,     both    defendant        officers    denied    knowing    who     had\n\ntestified before the grand jury.            A rational jury could well find,\n\nbased on its assessment of the defendant officers' credibility or\n\nfor other reasons, that Ciampa and Cachopa had different levels of\n\nknowledge about plaintiffs' protected conduct or otherwise had\n\ndifferent subjective motives for their actions.\n\n\n     15\n        Unlike in Earle, no special verdict form or special\nquestions were put to the jury in the second trial, and therefore\nwe cannot know the basis for the jury's verdict for Cachopa.\n\n                                         -32-\n\f               Similarly,    the   alleged     retaliatory   acts     by   the   two\n\ndefendant officers, although overlapping, were not identical.                     As\n\nthe majority acknowledges, plaintiffs also alleged some retaliatory\n\nacts \"for which Ciampa [was] the primary actor[];\" these \"were not\n\nsquarely presented to the jury in the second trial.\"                 For example,\n\nplaintiffs alleged that Ciampa took several retaliatory acts during\n\nthe period he served as acting police chief; those acts included\n\ndirecting Chamberlin to undergo a medical examination and issuing\n\nletters of warning to Wohlgemuth that were placed in his personnel\n\nfile.16\n\n               The majority, relying on Agosto-de-Feliciano v.\n\nAponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209, 1218 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc),\n\nasserts that these additional acts by Ciampa do not rise to the\n\nlevel     of   adverse     employment   actions    sufficient    to    sustain    a\n\nretaliation       claim.      However,    as    the   majority      acknowledges,\n\nplaintiffs' central claim against the defendant officers was that\n\nthey carried on \"a systematic campaign of retaliatory harassment\"\n\nagainst plaintiffs in 2004 and 2005.              For purposes of evaluating\n\nwhether this campaign of harassment rose to the level of an adverse\n\nemployment action, the acts of harassment cannot be isolated and\n\nanalyzed separately.          Instead, the trier of fact must determine\n\n\n\n     16\n       In addition, some evidence of adverse conduct, including\nchanges made to plaintiffs' training locations, was presented at\nthe second trial without a clear showing of whether Cachopa or\nCiampa was the primary actor.\n\n                                        -33-\n\fwhether the course of harassment, taken as a whole, \"result[ed] in\n\na work situation 'unreasonably inferior' to the norm for the\n\nposition.\"     Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1218; accord Welch,\n\n542   F.3d   at   937.   Given   the    somewhat   different   evidence   of\n\nharassment by the two defendant officers, a jury could reasonably\n\nfind that the actions by Cachopa did not amount to a campaign of\n\nretaliatory harassment, but the somewhat different actions by\n\nCiampa did.\n\n                                       V.\n\n             In this case, the majority declines to evaluate the\n\ndirected verdict for Ciampa under the well-established standard --\n\nassessing whether, viewing the evidence presented at the first\n\ntrial in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, no reasonable jury\n\ncould find Ciampa liable for retaliation.           Indeed, the majority\n\neffectively acknowledges that if it did apply the proper standard,\n\nfocusing on the evidence before the district court at the time of\n\nits ruling, the majority would have to conclude that the directed\n\nverdict for Ciampa was erroneously granted and remand the case for\n\na new trial.       To avoid that result, the majority turns to a\n\nharmless error analysis. However, for the reasons discussed above,\n\nthe majority is also unable to engage in the harmless analysis\n\nconducted in Earle.      Earle and similar cases do not support a\n\nfinding of harmless error where, as here, the directed verdict and\n\nthe subsequent jury verdict occurred in the course of two separate\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\ftrial proceedings, as to two different defendants, and as to\n\nsomewhat different allegations.\n\n          In the end, the majority resorts to affirming based on\n\nits impression, from the paper record, that Cachopa was at least as\n\nculpable as Ciampa, that the jury in the second trial rejected\n\nplaintiffs' claims against Cachopa, and that remanding for a new\n\ntrial on the claims against Ciampa would therefore be pointless.\n\nI cannot join in this reasoning, particularly where plaintiffs'\n\nconstitutional right to a jury trial is implicated.   The district\n\ncourt's grant of a directed verdict cannot be affirmed simply\n\nbecause the majority feels as a matter of rough justice that a\n\nremand would be a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\n                               -35-\n\f",

Following grants of summary judgment and directed verdicts by the district court, and a jury verdict on several remaining claims against one of the defendants, the defendants prevailed on each and every claim. The plaintiff officers now appeal.</p>\n<p>Stoughton (\"the Town\") is governed by a board of selectmen (\"the Board\") that appoints both the town manager and the chief of police. In June 2004, the then board members, by a divided vote, failed to reappoint the then chief of police, Manuel Cachopa. David Chamberlin, until then serving as one of several police lieutenants, had earlier submitted his retirement papers effective in July 2004, but he agreed at the Board's request to serve as interim chief and withdrew his retirement application. He held the interim chief position until the Board hired a replacement chief, Joseph Saccardo, in October 2004 and then reverted to his lieutenant position.</p>\n<p>In July 2004, Chamberlin learned of allegations that several police officers, including Cachopa, had engaged in criminal misconduct. Chamberlin informed the Norfolk County District Attorney, who appointed a special prosecutor in August. During this period Chamberlin met several times with the district attorney and the special prosecutor, joined on one occasion by a lieutenant, Francis Wohlgemuth. In October, at the special prosecutor's request, a number of officers were placed on leave, including Cachopa. A grand jury began to inquire into the matter and both Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth testified before the grand jury in late 2004.</p>\n<p>After Cachopa was denied reappointment, a recall campaign was begun to remove the board members who had opposed him. In the town election held in November 2004, those members were replaced by two new selectmen, Richard Levine and John Kowalczyk. In mid-November, the new board ordered the suspended officers reinstated and then reappointed Cachopa as chief on November 24. On his return Cachopa immediately made Christopher Ciampa, a sergeant and strong supporter of Cachopa, his effective deputy, promoting him over the heads of the serving lieutenants. In March 2005, Cachopa and two other officers were indicted, and the Board then made Ciampa acting police chief.</p>\n<p>In September 2006, Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth filed suit in federal district court against the Town, the Board, Cachopa, Ciampa, and three selectmen (who also had supported Cachopa): Levine, Kowalczyk and Scott Carrara. The gist of the complaint was that Cachopa and Ciampa, aided by the Board, had carried on in 2004 and 2005 a systematic campaign of retaliatory harassment against Chamberlin, Wohlgemuth and other officers who had either opposed Cachopa or remained neutral in the recall campaign. One of those other officers, Sergeant Robert Welch, brought his own suit against Cachopa, Ciampa and other defendants. <i>See </i><i>Welch v. Ciampa,</i> 542 F.3d 927 (1st Cir.2008) (reversing and remanding in part the dismissal of his claims).</p>\n<p>Some of the actions alleged by Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth were petty but a few were more serious; collectively, they arguably alleged enough harm to constitute a viable claimassuming that the actions were taken for a purpose unlawful under federal or state law. They included inconvenient changes of office and shift for the two plaintiffs, depriving Wohlgemuth of access to many offices in the station, unjustified reprimands, imposing limitations on the plaintiffs' preexisting authority, requiring them to wear blue shirts instead of senior officer white and inflicting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> inappropriate medical and other examinations on Chamberlin.</p>\n<p>The connection of the defendants other than Cachopa and Ciampa with these events was left obscure in the complaint save for one episode involving other town officials. In January 2005, the Town threatened to sue Chamberlin if he neither retired nor returned retirement incentive pay (allegedly totaling $21,000) which he had received after he initially agreed to retire. The Town did in fact bring such a suit, abandoning it when Chamberlinout on vacation and then sick leave since November 2004retired at the end of March 2005.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleged that the claimed harassment was retribution for a set of specific actions by Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth comprising speech assertedly protected under federal or state law or both, specifically: (1) requesting in July 2004 that the town manager investigate the operation of the department, including unequal discipline for those supporting and opposing Cachopa; (2) cooperating with the special prosecutor and grand jury in fall and winter 2004; and (3) advising the town manager by letters of a hostile work environment at the police department in December 2004.</p>\n<p>Several different statutes were invoked the Massachusetts Whistleblower Statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 185(b) (2009), the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, <i>id.</i> ch. 12, § 11I, and the federal civil rights statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2006), based on the First Amendmenttogether with a charge of abuse of process relating to the Town's lawsuit. In addition to this final common law claim, each of three categories of protected speech was made the subject of several different statutory claims and each was stated separately for each plaintiffresulting in 17 counts. Different defendants appeared in the various counts.</p>\n<p>Thereafter the case was narrowed in steps beginning with the district court's dismissal of the Board. Early on, the Board was dismissed on the ground that it was not subject to suit under the Whistleblower Statute or § 1983 and, although the district court's order does not explain why, dismissal of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act claim against the Board was also granted; plaintiffs make no mention of this lack of explanation on their present appeal so we need not pursue that issue.</p>\n<p>On November 27, 2007, the court granted summary judgment for the defendants on a number of counts, qualifying the order a week later. The remaining claims, then set for trial, were a single count under the Massachusetts Civil Rights ActWohlgemuth's claim against Cachopa based on his hostile work environment letter to the town managerthe Whistleblower statute claims of both plaintiffs against the Town, and their § 1983 claims based on their hostile work environment letters and of Chamberlin based on his grand jury testimony and cooperation with the special prosecutor.</p>\n<p>In the first trial, a mistrial was declared as to all claims against Cachopa after plaintiffs' counsel improperly referred to Cachopa's indictment. Then at the close of the plaintiffs' case, the district court, acting from the bench, granted defendants' oral motions for a directed verdict as to all claims against the remaining defendants. Asked to explain the basis for the directed verdict, the district court invoked (with one exception) \"all the reasons argued by the defense counsel and as expressed in their brief\"a category containing a number of disparate contentions.<sup>[1]</sup> The district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> court denied the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration and motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p>A second trial then ensued on the remaining claims against Cachopaplaintiffs' § 1983 claims based on the December hostile work environment letters, Wohlgemuth's Massachusetts Civil Rights Act claim based on his letter, and Chamberlin's § 1983 claim based on cooperation with the special prosecutor and grand jury and the jury found in Cachopa's favor on all of the claims. Before us now are appeals relating to the summary judgment and the district court's rulings in both trials. Denial of a separate new trial motion in the second trial was appealed too late and is not before us.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' joint principal brief asserts that the district court erred first by entering summary judgment on specified claims prior to the first trial and directing verdicts in that trial and second by making a series of errors in the course of the second trial. Our review of the directed verdicts is <i>de novo, </i><i>Ahern v. Scholz,</i> 85 F.3d 774, 793 (1st Cir.1996); review as to alleged trial errors depends upon the character and context of the ruling, <i>e.g., </i><i>McDonough v. City of Quincy,</i> 452 F.3d 8, 19 (1st Cir.2006) (exclusion of evidence reviewed for abuse of discretion); <i>O'Rourke v. City of Providence,</i> 235 F.3d 713, 736 (1st Cir. 2001) (jury instructions reviewed for plain error where party has not timely objected).</p>\n<p>The most far-reaching of the issues centers around First Amendment protection <i>vel non</i> for plaintiffs' statements, and two sets of claims that depend on that premise: the § 1983 claims and the parallel claims under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (which the parties treat as subject to the same analysis, <i>Hosford v. Sch. Comm. of Sandwich,</i> 421 Mass. 708, 659 N.E.2d 1178, 1180 n. 5 (1996)). To make out a free speech claim under § 1983, the plaintiffs \"must show that [they] engaged in constitutionally protected conduct and that this conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the alleged adverse employment action.\" <i>Welch,</i> 542 F.3d at 936.</p>\n<p>First Amendment claims of this kind have been conventional since the Supreme Court developed such a cause of action in the 1960s,<sup>[2]</sup> and police officers who voice concerns about misconduct and suffer for it have been plaintiffs in a number of such cases. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Tripp v. Cole,</i> 425 F.3d 5 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Wagner v. City of Holyoke,</i> 404 F.3d 504 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 546 U.S. 977, 126 S.Ct. 552, 163 L.Ed.2d 461 (2005); <i>Bennett v. City of Holyoke,</i> 362 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dep't,</i> 315 F.3d 65 (1st Cir. 2002). It is unclear how far such claims can survive the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> 547 U.S. 410, 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006), which ruled that \"when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.\"</p>\n<p>Virtually all of the \"protected conduct\" relied on by the plaintiffs was speech-related activity that arguably was done \"pursuant to their official duties\"; but it is unclear how far the Supreme Court intends to carry <i>Garcetti,</i> and the Massachusetts Whistleblower Statute offers quite similar protection unaffected by <i>Garcetti.</i><sup>[3]</sup> Although the First Amendment (implemented through § 1983 or the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act) differs from the Whistleblower Statute in many incidents, the core difficulty in this case is common to both: the difficulty of proving that Cachopa and Ciampa took various of their actions in order to retaliate for protected activity.</p>\n<p>The Stoughton Police Department was surely in turmoil in the 2004-2005 period. In a relatively brief window, the chief position was held by Cachopa, Chamberlin, Saccardo, Cachopa again and then Ciampa who was closely allied with Cachopa. Cachopa was himself ultimately convicted in 2009 of being an accessory after the fact to more serious misconduct of which another officer (Sergeant David Cohen) was convicted.<sup>[4]</sup> Officers who had not supported Cachopa or the recall campaign, including Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth, seem to have been subject to harassment after Cachopa regained authority and during Ciampa's tenure.</p>\n<p>But it remained the plaintiffs' task to establish that Cachopa, Ciampa or both took adverse action against one or both of the plaintiffs motivated at least in part by their protected conduct, and in this respect the plaintiffs' case rested primarily on soft inference as against flat denials by both the defendant officers. In particular, plaintiffs had no direct proof that either of the two defendant officers knew that Chamberlin had instigated the special prosecutor's inquiry or that either plaintiff had testified to the grand jury, and both defendants denied knowing about who testified before the grand jury.</p>\n<p>Further, certain of the small administrative steps complained of by the plaintiffs could be taken as hostile or defended as consistent with regulations, so it is not easy to work backwards and conclusively infer a malign motive from the acts themselves. Other problems included the uncertainty as to significant compensable harm, lack of medical evidence of emotional harm, and the fact that Chamberlin was on leave during most of the events. This, then, looks like a suitable case for a jury to sort out cause, motive and effect; and when the jury got the claims against Cachopa, it rejected them on the merits.</p>\n<p>It is true that the district court let the case against Cachopa go to the jury in the second trial while it directed a verdict in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> Ciampa's favor in the first. But Cachopa was the chief when the principal incidents occurred; Ciampa was his creature as his effective deputy promoted to that spot over the heads of the lieutenants; and the most plausible case against both rested on the notion that they were cooperating to inflict petty misery on the plaintiffs, one of whom had supplanted Cachopa and the other of whom had failed to support him.</p>\n<p>The jury in the second trial was allowed to consider practically all of the claimed acts of retaliation. A number of these acts were done by Cachopa directly (changing the plaintiffs' shift and shirt colors; appointing Ciampa as executive officer over the heads of the lieutenants and reducing the plaintiffs' responsibilities; sending Chamberlin letters demanding doctor's notes). Others were, by Cachopa's own admission, done at his direction by his deputy, Ciampa (moving Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth to a different office; imposing various restrictions on Chamberlin for not requalifying with his firearm). A few acts were presented to the jury without clear evidence as to whether Cachopa or Ciampa was the primary actor (changing plaintiffs' training locations).</p>\n<p>In other words, for almost all the acts of alleged retaliation, Cachopa was either the principal actor or at least as culpable as Ciampa. Nonetheless, the jury found that Cachopa did not retaliate against the plaintiffs for protected conduct. The jury's determination that Cachopa was not liable \"fatally eviscerated\" the plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa and the defendants from the Town. <i>Earle v. Benoit,</i> 850 F.2d 836, 845 (1st Cir.1988).<sup>[5]</sup><i>Earle</i> is not conclusivethe fatal determination there was in the same trialbut the principle is the same, namely, that courts do not have further proceedings based on harmless errors.</p>\n<p>Appellate review after the grant of a directed verdict usually involves a measure of speculation about how the jury would have decided if a directed verdict had been denied; but no speculation is needed here because the same claims were effectively tried and lost in the second case. This is a rare occurrence and perhaps without precedent; but that should hardly prevent us from exercising common sense. Yes, the Seventh Amendment provides for jury trials; but, directed verdicts and harmless error are established qualifications (so too are waiver, stipulation and estoppel). Whether the case against Ciampa was fairly tested by the second trial is a separate question.</p>\n<p>A few alleged retaliatory actsfor which Ciampa and the Town were the primary actorswere not squarely presented to the jury in the second trial. After Ciampa became acting chief, he directed Chamberlin to undergo a medical examination to determine his fitness to return to duty; issued warnings to Wohlgemuth for comments made to other officers; and sent Wohlgemuth a letter about sick time abuse. These incidents not only fail as a retaliation claim, <i>cf. </i><i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque,</i> 889 F.2d 1209, 1218 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc), but add no real weight to the more serious incidents that occurred while Cachopa was chief.</p>\n<p>Thus, the medical examination was required for officers out of work for five days <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> or more due to off-duty injury or illness, and the dispute centered around a possible conflict of the policy with the union contract; Wohlgemuth did not seriously deny making some negative comments about other officers; and whether he marginally exceeded his sick time is unclear even after reading relevant testimony. By contrast, the list of alleged wrongful acts occurring while Cachopa was chief is far longer and included at least a few of some substance.<sup>[6]</sup> This is presumably why the court did not direct a verdict for Cachopa; even so, Cachopa prevailed.</p>\n<p>As for the Town, it was within its rights in filing suit against Chamberlin over his retirement incentive. Chamberlin did not retire as promised for whatever reason, and the Board could legitimately seek to enforce the agreement; engaging in protected conduct did not insulate Chamberlin from these consequences. <i>See </i><i>Blackie v. Maine,</i> 75 F.3d 716, 723-24 (1st Cir.1996). According to Chamberlin's own testimony, the Board's desire that he retire predated much of the arguably protected conduct.</p>\n<p>Nowhere do plaintiffs explain how they could have prevailed against Ciampa when the jury rejected counterpart claims against Cachopa. Instead, they argue that the second trial was itself flawed: of their twelve claims in this court, eight assert errors in the second trial. Of course, the outcome of the second trial could not insulate defendants if it were itself flawed; but a number of the claims involve trial-court judgment calls about which little need be said and the most important of the challenged rulingsdiscussed nextdo not comprise reversible error.</p>\n<p>Most important, plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by excluding a report that the Town commissioned from attorney Marc Terry (the \"Terry Report\") in response to the plaintiffs' letters alleging a hostile work environment. Terry interviewed a number of witnesses regarding the plaintiffs' allegations and concluded that Cachopa had retaliated against the plaintiffs both for their cooperation with the grand jury investigation and for failing to support Cachopa's effort to remain as chief.</p>\n<p>In excluding the report, the district court stated, \"I think given its timing and given the fact that it was requested in July of 2004 and we don't get it until October of 2005 . . . . [and] given its level of generality, I think it's unduly prejudicial.\" The reference to timing is unclear to us and the reference to generality is perhaps confusing; the report was fairly detailed as to the underlying events. But in all likelihood the district court meant that the utility of the report to plaintiffs was its <i>final assessment,</i> which their brief underscores, that Cachopa was not credible in his denials as to what he did and why.</p>\n<p>Cachopa's credibility as to what he did and why was central to the second trial, but the underlying evidence of events bearing on that was available to the plaintiffs. To superimpose Terry's evaluation on what the jury was expected to decide served no useful purpose: it was the jury's task to decide whether to believe Cachopa. Terry was not qualified or offered as an expert on \"credibility\"; and to treat his independent judgment as evidence would simply weight one side of the scale to Cachopa's disadvantage.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> It thus does not matter whether Terry's report avoids a hearsay objection by virtue of Rule 803(8)(c) or otherwise;<sup>[7]</sup> Rule 403 independently permits exclusion of evidence that is unduly prejudicial and to exclude the report on this ground was not an abuse of discretion. This would be a different case if plaintiffs were pointing us to raw facts that Terry had uncovered and for which evidence was not readily available to plaintiffs themselves.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred by refusing to allow them to examine Cachopa over his role in the initial investigation of Cohen, whose conduct was the subject of the later inquiry by the special prosecutor and grand jury investigation. The plaintiffs claim that Cachopa opened the door to the issue by testifying that he himself had brought the matter before the district attorney in 2003, and that they were denied the chance to demonstrate fully Cachopa's misconduct in this matter.</p>\n<p>However, the transcript indicates that the district court did not flatly bar the plaintiffs from examining Cachopa on the Cohen investigation. Rather, Cachopa was the first witness to testify in the case, and the district court seemingly believed that the jury should first be apprised of any wrongs that Cachopa did to the plaintiffs before digressions into Cachopa's role in the Cohen matter. The court ruled that \"[y]ou better go to something that's relevant and then you can come back to this. You can come back to it . . . if it's relevant.\" The plaintiffs tried again several questions later, in response to which the court sustained an objection \"without prejudice to your returning to it.\"</p>\n<p>So far as appears, the plaintiffs made no effort to question Cachopa on the Cohen matter again. The Cohen matter, and Cachopa's conduct in relation to it, was arguably \"relevant\" under Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidencefor example, because it bore on his motivation to retaliate against Chamberlin for prompting an inquiry into the matter. But the district court \"enjoy[s] wide latitude in matters concerning the ordering of proof and the presentation of evidence,\" <i>Morales Feliciano v. Rullan,</i> 378 F.3d 42, 57 (1st Cir. 2004), <i>cert. denied,</i> 543 U.S. 1054, 125 S.Ct. 910, 160 L.Ed.2d 776 (2005), and plaintiffs were free to return to the Cohen matter after they adduced evidence that Cachopa had taken steps against the plaintiffs for which his motive was relevant.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs next argue that the district court erred by instructing the jury to determine whether the plaintiffs' December 7 letters alleging a hostile work environment were protected conduct under the \"matters of public concern\" and interest-balancing tests used by the Supreme Court, at least prior to the exception now carved out by <i>Garcetti.</i> Whether speech is constitutionally protected is ordinarily a matter for the judge, not the jury;<sup>[8]</sup> but the plaintiffs did not object to this aspect <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> of the jury instructions and so the objection is waived, absent plain errora stiff test in civil cases, <i>see </i><i>Diaz-Seijo v. Fajardo-Velez,</i> 397 F.3d 53, 56 (1st Cir.2005), which plaintiffs do not meet.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also challenge the district court's failure to instruct the jury that the plaintiffs' cooperation with the special prosecutor was protected under the First Amendment. As two senior officers in the police department, it was within the scope of both plaintiffs' duties to cooperate with the district attorney and the special prosecutor in investigating alleged criminal activity within the police department. Wohlgemuth shared responsibility for internal investigations, and Chamberlin had launched the investigation as part of his duties as chief. The district court correctly ruled that this conduct was not protected by the First Amendment under <i>Garcetti.</i></p>\n<p>We are not suggesting that <i>Garcetti</i> applies every time a police officer has conversations with a prosecutor. What constitutes official duties will necessarily vary with the circumstances including the rank of the officer, his areas of responsibility and the nature of the conversations; but in this case the facts just summarized are sufficient. The district court also instructed the jury that cooperation with the grand jury <i>was</i> protected speech; but this instruction, being favorable to plaintiffs, is not before us and need not be addressed.</p>\n<p>The district court also told the jury that the plaintiffs presented \"no medical testimony\" that distinguished emotional distress based on \"protected speech from the other divisiveness in the department,\" and \"you need such testimony.\" No per se rule requires expert testimony for an award of compensatory damages based on emotional distress, <i>e.g., </i><i>McDonough,</i> 452 F.3d at 22, but if there was error, it was harmless. The jury was told to award at least nominal damages if a protected speech violation occurred and did not do soso the predicate for any damages was absent.</p>\n<p>The remaining claims of trial error require no detailed discussion. The plaintiffs are wrong that the district court precluded proof of the shift changes and shirt color issue pressed by plaintiffs; the district court's restrictions on time allowed to each side were within the district court's authority; and a complained of comment by the district courtitself somewhat opaqueis not a basis for a new trial.</p>\n<p>The judgment is <i>affirmed.</i> Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>Although the majority affirms the district court's grant of a directed verdict<sup>[9]</sup> in favor of Ciampa, it does not do so on the familiar ground that no reasonable jury could find Ciampa liable for retaliation based on the evidence presented at the first trial. Instead, it concludes that any error in the granting of the directed verdict for Ciampa was \"harmless\" because of the rejection of plaintiffs' claims against Cachopa by a different jury in a subsequent trial. In my view, this harmless <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> error analysis is unprecedented and unsupportable. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the decision to affirm the directed verdict in favor of Ciampa.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Because it is important for understanding the flaws in the majority's harmless error analysis, I briefly summarize the relevant procedural history. In January 2008, plaintiffs proceeded to trial on their retaliation claims against Ciampa, Cachopa, and other defendants. Early in that trial, the court granted a mistrial on all claims against Cachopa. Plaintiffs continued to present evidence against the remaining defendants. At the close of their case, the court granted a directed verdict on all claims against Ciampa and the remaining defendants. Following the court's denial of plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration and for new trial, plaintiffs appealed. Several weeks later, plaintiffs proceeded to trial on their retaliation claims against Cachopa. Plaintiffs' allegations against Cachopa, although overlapping with their allegations against Ciampa, were not identical. The jury returned a verdict for Cachopa, and plaintiffs appealed from that verdict. Plaintiffs' two appeals, from the dispositions in the first and second trials, were later consolidated in the proceeding now before us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review de novo the district court's decision to grant a directed verdict. <i>Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hernández,</i> 447 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir.2006). The district court could properly grant a directed verdict for Ciampa at the close of plaintiffs' case in the first trial only if, based on the evidence presented at the time of its ruling, \"a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for [plaintiffs].\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). In our review of the grant of a directed verdict, we apply the same standard as the district court. <i>Id.</i> We must \"examine the evidence and all fair inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff[s] and may not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). Viewing the evidence in this light, we may uphold the directed verdict for Ciampa only if no reasonable jury could find defendant liable based on the evidence presented by plaintiffs at the first trial. <i>See </i><i>Acevedo-Feliciano,</i> 447 F.3d at 121.</p>\n<p>In order to prevail on their retaliation claims, plaintiffs had to show that they \"engaged in constitutionally protected conduct and that this conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the alleged adverse employment action.\" <i>Welch v. Ciampa,</i> 542 F.3d 927, 936 (1st Cir.2008). The majority acknowledges that plaintiffs engaged in arguably constitutionally protected conduct, that the adverse actions by Cachopa and Ciampa, viewed collectively, were arguably harmful enough to support a viable claim, that the parties proffered conflicting evidence as to motive, and that this was \"a suitable case for the jury to sort out cause, motive and effect.\" However, having recognized these central disputes suitable for jury determination, the majority does not then evaluate the directed verdict on the merits, assessing whether a reasonable jury could find Ciampa liable based on the evidence presented at the first trial. Instead, the majority looks to the second trial, in which Ciampa was not a party, and views that trial as a proxy for what would have happened if plaintiffs' claims had gone to the jury in the first trial. The majority concludes that even if <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> the district court erred in directing a verdict for Ciampa, any error was harmless, because similar retaliation claims against <i>Cachopa</i> went to a jury in the second trial and that jury ultimately found in his favor. None of the parties raised this harmless error argument in their briefing.<sup>[11]</sup> That is not surprising. There is no precedent for such an application of harmless error.</p>\n<p>As a general matter, under the harmless error rule, we disregard \"errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2111; <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 61. In the ordinary harmless error case, an error made in the proceedings leading up to the final judgmentfor example, an erroneous evidentiary ruling is deemed harmless to the ultimate disposition.</p>\n<p>In certain narrow factual circumstances, courts have concluded that an error in the <i>final disposition</i>for example, an erroneous directed verdictwas harmless in light of subsequent proceedings. For example, in <i>Earle v. Benoit,</i> 850 F.2d 836, 840 (1st Cir.1988), the primary authority relied on by the majority for its harmless error analysis, the plaintiff, Earle, alleged that defendant police officers had conspired to deprive him of his civil rights by subjecting him to unlawful arrest, illegal searches, excessive force, and other harassment. At the close of Earle's case before the jury, the court directed a verdict in favor of defendants on Earle's conspiracy claim, but permitted his other claims to go to the jury. <i>Id.</i> at 837. That jury ultimately returned a verdict for defendants, responding negatively to special jury questions regarding whether the alleged unlawful arrest, illegal searches, and use of excessive force violated Earle's civil rights. <i>Id.</i> at 845.</p>\n<p>The <i>Earle</i> court concluded that the directed verdict was erroneously granted because \"there was sufficient circumstantial evidence (had the jury found in Earle's favor on the substantive claims) for a reasonable jury to have inferred a conspiracy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 844. Nevertheless, this error was harmless because a § 1983 conspiracy requires an \"actual deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws,\" and therefore the jury's ultimate rejection of Earle's underlying civil rights claims \"fatally eviscerated Earle's conspiracy claim.\" <i>Id.</i> at 845 (internal quotation marks omitted).<sup>[12]</sup> The court reasoned that, in a real and practical sense, even if the district court had permitted Earle's conspiracy claim to go to the jury, that claim would have been rejected by the jury. Given the jury's findings on Earle's claims of significant civil rights violations, the jury could not have also found defendants liable for a civil rights conspiracy. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, \"as a practical matter,\" in light of the jury's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> consistent rejection of Earle's civil rights claims, it was \"inconceivable\" that \"the jury would have found for plaintiff on the closely related conspiracy charge.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Goulet v. New Penn Motor Express, Inc.,</i> 512 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir.2008) (finding wrongly directed verdict harmless \"where the jury's ultimate verdict <i>necessarily defeats</i> the claim\" on which directed verdict was erroneously granted (emphasis added)).<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>As I explain more fully below, this case is fundamentally different from <i>Earle</i> for two reasons. First, the directed verdict for Ciampa and the jury verdict for Cachopa occurred not in a single trial, but in two separate trials that culminated in two separate appeals. Second, given the nature of plaintiffs' claims and the particular facts of this case, the jury verdict for Cachopa did not necessarily defeat plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>In <i>Earle,</i> as noted, the directed verdict and the ultimate jury verdict occurred in the course of a <i>single</i> trial proceeding. Thus, the <i>Earle</i> court concluded that given the jury's findings on Earle's underlying civil rights claims, that jury could not have rationally found for Earle on his conspiracy claim. Here, of course, the directed verdict on plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa and the jury's rejection of plaintiffs' claims against Cachopa occurred during two <i>separate</i> trial proceedings, which culminated in separate dispositions and separate appeals. In the first trial, following the court's grant of a mistrial on all claims against Cachopa, the court directed a verdict on all remaining claims against Ciampa and the other defendants. Thus, <i>none</i> of plaintiffs' claims reached a jury in the first trial. In the second trial, plaintiffs' claims against Cachopa were tried by a jury, and that jury found for Cachopa.</p>\n<p>Although the majority glosses over this somewhat odd procedural history, it cannot be ignored. Here, unlike in <i>Earle</i> and similar cases, we cannot say with any certainty how the first jury would have decided plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa if the directed verdict had not been granted, because that jury made no findings on any of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> plaintiffs' claims. Without any findings by the first jury, we have no basis for concluding that the first jury could not have rationally found for plaintiffs on their claims against Ciampa. We cannot say, as the <i>Earle</i> court did, that if the district court had not granted the directed verdict, the jury necessarily would have rejected plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa.</p>\n<p>My concerns with the majority's unique harmless error analysis are further heightened by its constitutional implications. Under the Seventh Amendment, plaintiffs have a right to a jury trial on their claims for legal relief under § 1983.<sup>[14]</sup><i>City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd.,</i> 526 U.S. 687, 709-10, 119 S.Ct. 1624, 143 L.Ed.2d 882 (1999). Of course, it is well-established that the proper grant of a directed verdict does not offend a party's Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. <i>Galloway v. United States,</i> 319 U.S. 372, 389, 63 S.Ct. 1077, 87 L.Ed. 1458 (1943); 9B Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> § 2522 (3d ed.2008). The directed verdict procedure is constitutional because a properly granted directed verdict \"only deprives the losing party of the possibility of an unreasonable verdict, a possibility not protected by the Constitution.\" Wright &amp; Miller, <i>supra,</i> § 2522. The analysis applied in <i>Earle,</i> although styled as a harmless error analysis, is a variant on this principle. The <i>Earle</i> court found that, in light of the jury's finding on the underlying civil rights claims, the jury could not rationally find for plaintiff on his conspiracy claim. Thus, the court's decision to withdraw Earle's conspiracy claim from the jury did not violate any right to a jury trial because it only deprived Earle of the possibility of an irrational verdict.</p>\n<p>Here, however, the majority does <i>not</i> hold, under either the traditional directed verdict analysis or the <i>Earle</i> harmless error analysis, that the directed verdict for Ciampa in the first trial only deprived plaintiffs of the possibility of an unreasonable verdict at the hands of the first jury. On the contrary, the majority acknowledges that plaintiffs presented evidence at the first trial that was arguably sufficient for the jury to find Ciampa liable for retaliation. In these circumstances, the decision not to allow plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa to be heard by the jury, and to affirm the directed verdict in favor of Ciampa, implicates plaintiffs' Seventh Amendment rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Even if the directed verdict for Ciampa and the jury verdict for Cachopa had occurred in the course of a single trial, <i>Earle</i> and similar cases would not support a finding of harmless error here. On the facts of this case, as set forth by the majority, it is clear that the jury verdict for Cachopa did not \"necessarily defeat[]\" plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa. <i>Goulet,</i> 512 F.3d at 43. Instead, for a variety of reasons, a rational jury could logically reject plaintiffs' retaliation claims against Cachopa, but at the same time uphold plaintiffs' retaliation claims against Ciampa.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>For example, a rational jury could have reached different conclusions about Ciampa and Cachopa on the issue of motive. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> Plaintiffs' retaliation claims required a showing that Ciampa, Cachopa, or both took adverse actions motivated at least in part by plaintiffs' protected conduct. <i>See </i><i>Welch,</i> 542 F.3d at 936. The inquiry into motive is highly individualized and fact-specific, requiring an evaluation of the defendant officers' actual, subjective intent. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz Velez,</i> 341 F.3d 86, 97 (1st Cir.2003) (explaining that \"subjective intent <i>is</i> an essential element\" of analogous political discrimination claim under First Amendment). As the majority acknowledges, there was a central dispute in this case on the element of motive plaintiffs' case as to retaliatory motive \"rested primarily on soft inference as against flat denials\" by Ciampa and Cachopa, and in particular, both defendant officers denied knowing who had testified before the grand jury. A rational jury could well find, based on its assessment of the defendant officers' credibility or for other reasons, that Ciampa and Cachopa had different levels of knowledge about plaintiffs' protected conduct or otherwise had different subjective motives for their actions.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the alleged retaliatory acts by the two defendant officers, although overlapping, were not identical. As the majority acknowledges, plaintiffs also alleged some retaliatory acts \"for which Ciampa [was] the primary actor[];\" these \"were not squarely presented to the jury in the second trial.\" For example, plaintiffs alleged that Ciampa took several retaliatory acts during the period he served as acting police chief; those acts included directing Chamberlin to undergo a medical examination and issuing letters of warning to Wohlgemuth that were placed in his personnel file.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>The majority, relying on <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque,</i> 889 F.2d 1209, 1218 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc), asserts that these additional acts by Ciampa do not rise to the level of adverse employment actions sufficient to sustain a retaliation claim. However, as the majority acknowledges, plaintiffs' central claim against the defendant officers was that they carried on \"a systematic campaign of retaliatory harassment\" against plaintiffs in 2004 and 2005. For purposes of evaluating whether this campaign of harassment rose to the level of an adverse employment action, the acts of harassment cannot be isolated and analyzed separately. Instead, the trier of fact must determine whether the course of harassment, taken as a whole, \"result[ed] in a work situation `unreasonably inferior' to the norm for the position.\" <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano,</i> 889 F.2d at 1218; <i>accord </i><i>Welch,</i> 542 F.3d at 937. Given the somewhat different evidence of harassment by the two defendant officers, a jury could reasonably find that the actions by Cachopa did not amount to a campaign of retaliatory harassment, but the somewhat different actions by Ciampa did.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>In this case, the majority declines to evaluate the directed verdict for Ciampa under the well-established standardassessing whether, viewing the evidence presented at the first trial in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, no reasonable jury could find Ciampa liable for retaliation. Indeed, the majority effectively acknowledges that if it did apply the proper standard, focusing on the evidence before the district court at the time of its ruling, the majority would have to conclude that the directed verdict for Ciampa was erroneously <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> granted and remand the case for a new trial. To avoid that result, the majority turns to a harmless error analysis. However, for the reasons discussed above, the majority is also unable to engage in the harmless analysis conducted in <i>Earle. Earle</i> and similar cases do not support a finding of harmless error where, as here, the directed verdict and the subsequent jury verdict occurred in the course of two separate trial proceedings, as to two different defendants, and as to somewhat different allegations.</p>\n<p>In the end, the majority resorts to affirming based on its impression, from the paper record, that Cachopa was at least as culpable as Ciampa, that the jury in the second trial rejected plaintiffs' claims against Cachopa, and that remanding for a new trial on the claims against Ciampa would therefore be pointless. I cannot join in this reasoning, particularly where plaintiffs' constitutional right to a jury trial is implicated. The district court's grant of a directed verdict cannot be affirmed simply because the majority feels as a matter of rough justice that a remand would be a waste of time.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Those grounds included a lack of compensable damages, coupled with a lack of evil motive or intent sufficient to award punitive damages; the fact that many of the alleged retaliatory acts took place prior to the December hostile work environment letters; a lack of knowledge by the defendants of the plaintiffs' grand jury testimony; a lack of retaliatory acts by the Selectmen or Ciampa; and a lack of a policy or custom of retaliation by the Town. The district court said, however, that it did not adopt in full the defendants' reading of current First Amendment doctrine.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Connick v. Myers,</i> 461 U.S. 138, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983); <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); <i>Pickering v.

Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 185(a), (b); and the protected conduct, subject to certain conditions, includesto paraphrase two of the subsections that follow: (1) disclosing to a supervisor or \"public body\" activity by the employer that the complaining employee believes to be unlawful or dangerous; and (2) providing information or testimony to a \"public body\" conducting an investigation into unlawful conduct or a threat to safety. <i>Id.</i> ch. 149, § 185(b).</p>\n<p>[4]  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court later reversed Cohen's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial, on the grounds that the trial court had violated Cohen's right to a public trial by restricting access to the courtroom during jury selection. <i>Commonwealth v. Cohen,</i> 455 Mass. 600, 919 N.E.2d 628 (2010).</p>\n<p>[5]  <i>Earle</i> is far from the only example. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Goulet v. New Penn Motor Express, Inc.,</i> 512 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Senra v. Cunningham,</i> 9 F.3d 168, 174 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Dixon v. City of Lawton,</i> 898 F.2d 1443, 1449 (10th Cir. 1990); <i>James v. Nico Energy Corp.,</i> 838 F.2d 1365, 1373 (5th Cir.1988); <i>Mello v.

American Distilling Co.,</i> 570 F.2d 848, 855 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p>[6]  The ones of some arguable substance included Cachopa's altering of Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth shifts; Cachopa's appointment of Ciampa; and several other actions taken by Ciampa but seemingly at Cachopa's direction: a requirement that Chamberlin requalify to carry firearms and confinement to station until this occurred; a reduction in Wohlgemuth's duties; and an official reprimand in Chamberlin's personnel file.</p>\n<p>[7]  Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(c) creates a hearsay exception for reports of \"public offices or agencies, setting forth . . . factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.\" The plaintiffs also cite Rule 801(d)(2)(C), which covers statements by authorized persons, and Rule 801(d)(2)(D), which covers statements by agents.</p>\n<p>[8]  <i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 148 n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (\"The inquiry into the protected status of speech is one of law, not fact.\"); <i>Curran v. Cousins,</i> 509 F.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir.2007) (\"[I]t is the judge who decides as a matter of law the issues in the two steps <i>Garcetti</i> identifies.\"); <i>Lewis v. City of Boston,</i> 321 F.3d 207, 219 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>[9]  We note that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 was amended in 1991, and \"the term judgment as a matter of law was adopted to refer to preverdict (directed verdict) and postverdict (judgment notwithstanding the verdict) motions with a terminology that does not conceal the common identity of two motions made at different times in the proceeding.\" <i>Coastal Fuels of P.R., Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp.,</i> 79 F.3d 182, 199 n. 14 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). We refer to the district court's ruling as a directed verdict to remain consistent with the majority's terminology.</p>\n<p>[10]  I join the majority's decision in all other respects.</p>\n<p>[11]  Instead, defendants contended in their briefing, in the traditional manner, that no reasonable jury could find for plaintiffs on their retaliation claims based on the evidence presented at the first trial, and therefore the directed verdict was properly granted. Defendants contended, inter alia, that there was no evidence Ciampa or Cachopa knew that plaintiffs cooperated with the special prosecutor or testified before the grand jury, and that any retaliation that occurred after plaintiffs' December 2004 hostile work environment letters did not rise to the level of an adverse employment action. The only suggestion by defendants of an argument even resembling the majority's harmless error analysis is their statement, in a footnote, that \"the jury verdict in Cachopa's favor in Trial Two further supports the reasonableness of the Court's entry of a Directed Verdict in Trial One.\"</p>\n<p>[12]  The court acknowledged that Earle provided evidence of other more trivial confrontations with police, such as being stopped for alleged traffic violations, but concluded that no jury could have found that any of these incidents constituted a deprivation of a constitutional right, as required for a § 1983 civil rights conspiracy. <i>Id.</i> at 845.</p>\n<p>[13]  My research has uncovered a smattering of other cases, from our own circuit and others, applying harmless error analysis to a directed verdict. Like <i>Earle,</i> these decisions have found harmless error where the jury verdict \"necessarily defeats the claim\" on which a directed verdict was incorrectly granted. <i>Goulet,</i> 512 F.3d at 43; <i>see id.</i> at 42-43 (concluding that any error in directed verdict for employer on plaintiff's hybrid Labor Management Relations Act § 301 claim was harmless, where the jury's ultimate rejection of plaintiff's § 301 claim against union was \"fatal\" to claim against employer); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Uphoff Figueroa v. Alejandro,</i> 597 F.3d 423, 433 (1st Cir.2010) (holding that even if court erred in directing verdict for employer on plaintiff's state law retaliation claim, it was harmless given the jury's finding for employer on \"identical\" federal law retaliation claim); <i>Snyder v. Ag Trucking, Inc.,</i> 57 F.3d 484, 491 (6th Cir. 1995) (holding that directing a verdict for employer on claim for willful violation of ADEA was harmless error because, given jury's rejection of underlying ADEA claim, it \"could not\" have found willful violation of ADEA); <i>Dixon v. City of Lawton,</i> 898 F.2d 1443, 1449 (10th Cir.1990) (finding any error in failing to submit § 1983 claim to jury harmless, given jury's conclusion that no defendants violated plaintiff's constitutional rights by use of excessive force); <i>Mello v. K-Mart Corp.,</i> 792 F.2d 1228, 1231 (1st Cir. 1986) (concluding that error in directing verdict for manufacturer was harmless where jury ultimately rejected product liability claims against vendor, and in reaching that verdict jury necessarily had to find that there was no manufacturing defect); <i>Cenco Inc. v. Seidman &amp; Seidman,</i> 686 F.2d 449, 453 (7th Cir. 1982) (holding that any error in directing verdict for defendant on plaintiff's claim for conspiracy to defraud was harmless, given that jury ultimately rejected underlying fraud claim).</p>\n<p>[14]  The Seventh Amendment provides: \"In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\"</p>\n<p>[15]  Unlike in <i>Earle,</i> no special verdict form or special questions were put to the jury in the second trial, and therefore we cannot know the basis for the jury's verdict for Cachopa.</p>\n<p>[16]  In addition, some evidence of adverse conduct, including changes made to plaintiffs' training locations, was presented at the second trial without a clear showing of whether Cachopa or Ciampa was the primary actor.</p>\n\n</div>",

Following grants of summary judgment and directed verdicts by the district court, and a jury verdict on several remaining claims against one of the defendants, the defendants prevailed on each and every claim. The plaintiff officers now appeal.</p>\n<p>Stoughton (\"the Town\") is governed by a board of selectmen (\"the Board\") that appoints both the town manager and the chief of police. In June 2004, the then board members, by a divided vote, failed to reappoint the then chief of police, Manuel Cachopa. David Chamberlin, until then serving as one of several police lieutenants, had earlier submitted his retirement papers effective in July 2004, but he agreed at the Board's request to serve as interim chief and withdrew his retirement application. He held the interim chief position until the Board hired a replacement chief, Joseph Saccardo, in October 2004 and then reverted to his lieutenant position.</p>\n<p>In July 2004, Chamberlin learned of allegations that several police officers, including Cachopa, had engaged in criminal misconduct. Chamberlin informed the Norfolk County District Attorney, who appointed a special prosecutor in August. During this period Chamberlin met several times with the district attorney and the special prosecutor, joined on one occasion by a lieutenant, Francis Wohlgemuth. In October, at the special prosecutor's request, a number of officers were placed on leave, including Cachopa. A grand jury began to inquire into the matter and both Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth testified before the grand jury in late 2004.</p>\n<p>After Cachopa was denied reappointment, a recall campaign was begun to remove the board members who had opposed him. In the town election held in November 2004, those members were replaced by two new selectmen, Richard Levine and John Kowalczyk. In mid-November, the new board ordered the suspended officers reinstated and then reappointed Cachopa as chief on November 24. On his return Cachopa immediately made Christopher Ciampa, a sergeant and strong supporter of Cachopa, his effective deputy, promoting him over the heads of the serving lieutenants. In March 2005, Cachopa and two other officers were indicted, and the Board then made Ciampa acting police chief.</p>\n<p>In September 2006, Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth filed suit in federal district court against the Town, the Board, Cachopa, Ciampa, and three selectmen (who also had supported Cachopa): Levine, Kowalczyk and Scott Carrara. The gist of the complaint was that Cachopa and Ciampa, aided by the Board, had carried on in 2004 and 2005 a systematic campaign of retaliatory harassment against Chamberlin, Wohlgemuth and other officers who had either opposed Cachopa or remained neutral in the recall campaign. One of those other officers, Sergeant Robert Welch, brought his own suit against Cachopa, Ciampa and other defendants. <i>See </i><i>Welch v. Ciampa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203489\"><a href=\"/opinion/203489/welch-v-ciampa/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2008) (reversing and remanding in part the dismissal of his claims).</p>\n<p>Some of the actions alleged by Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth were petty but a few were more serious; collectively, they arguably alleged enough harm to constitute a viable claimassuming that the actions were taken for a purpose unlawful under federal or state law. They included inconvenient changes of office and shift for the two plaintiffs, depriving Wohlgemuth of access to many offices in the station, unjustified reprimands, imposing limitations on the plaintiffs' preexisting authority, requiring them to wear blue shirts instead of senior officer white and inflicting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> inappropriate medical and other examinations on Chamberlin.</p>\n<p>The connection of the defendants other than Cachopa and Ciampa with these events was left obscure in the complaint save for one episode involving other town officials. In January 2005, the Town threatened to sue Chamberlin if he neither retired nor returned retirement incentive pay (allegedly totaling $21,000) which he had received after he initially agreed to retire. The Town did in fact bring such a suit, abandoning it when Chamberlinout on vacation and then sick leave since November 2004retired at the end of March 2005.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleged that the claimed harassment was retribution for a set of specific actions by Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth comprising speech assertedly protected under federal or state law or both, specifically: (1) requesting in July 2004 that the town manager investigate the operation of the department, including unequal discipline for those supporting and opposing Cachopa; (2) cooperating with the special prosecutor and grand jury in fall and winter 2004; and (3) advising the town manager by letters of a hostile work environment at the police department in December 2004.</p>\n<p>Several different statutes were invoked the Massachusetts Whistleblower Statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 185(b) (2009), the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, <i>id.</i> ch. 12, § 11I, and the federal civil rights statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2006), based on the First Amendmenttogether with a charge of abuse of process relating to the Town's lawsuit. In addition to this final common law claim, each of three categories of protected speech was made the subject of several different statutory claims and each was stated separately for each plaintiffresulting in 17 counts. Different defendants appeared in the various counts.</p>\n<p>Thereafter the case was narrowed in steps beginning with the district court's dismissal of the Board. Early on, the Board was dismissed on the ground that it was not subject to suit under the Whistleblower Statute or § 1983 and, although the district court's order does not explain why, dismissal of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act claim against the Board was also granted; plaintiffs make no mention of this lack of explanation on their present appeal so we need not pursue that issue.</p>\n<p>On November 27, 2007, the court granted summary judgment for the defendants on a number of counts, qualifying the order a week later. The remaining claims, then set for trial, were a single count under the Massachusetts Civil Rights ActWohlgemuth's claim against Cachopa based on his hostile work environment letter to the town managerthe Whistleblower statute claims of both plaintiffs against the Town, and their § 1983 claims based on their hostile work environment letters and of Chamberlin based on his grand jury testimony and cooperation with the special prosecutor.</p>\n<p>In the first trial, a mistrial was declared as to all claims against Cachopa after plaintiffs' counsel improperly referred to Cachopa's indictment. Then at the close of the plaintiffs' case, the district court, acting from the bench, granted defendants' oral motions for a directed verdict as to all claims against the remaining defendants. Asked to explain the basis for the directed verdict, the district court invoked (with one exception) \"all the reasons argued by the defense counsel and as expressed in their brief\"a category containing a number of disparate contentions.<sup>[1]</sup> The district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> court denied the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration and motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p>A second trial then ensued on the remaining claims against Cachopaplaintiffs' § 1983 claims based on the December hostile work environment letters, Wohlgemuth's Massachusetts Civil Rights Act claim based on his letter, and Chamberlin's § 1983 claim based on cooperation with the special prosecutor and grand jury and the jury found in Cachopa's favor on all of the claims. Before us now are appeals relating to the summary judgment and the district court's rulings in both trials. Denial of a separate new trial motion in the second trial was appealed too late and is not before us.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' joint principal brief asserts that the district court erred first by entering summary judgment on specified claims prior to the first trial and directing verdicts in that trial and second by making a series of errors in the course of the second trial.

In a relatively brief window, the chief position was held by Cachopa, Chamberlin, Saccardo, Cachopa again and then Ciampa who was closely allied with Cachopa. Cachopa was himself ultimately convicted in 2009 of being an accessory after the fact to more serious misconduct of which another officer (Sergeant David Cohen) was convicted.<sup>[4]</sup> Officers who had not supported Cachopa or the recall campaign, including Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth, seem to have been subject to harassment after Cachopa regained authority and during Ciampa's tenure.</p>\n<p>But it remained the plaintiffs' task to establish that Cachopa, Ciampa or both took adverse action against one or both of the plaintiffs motivated at least in part by their protected conduct, and in this respect the plaintiffs' case rested primarily on soft inference as against flat denials by both the defendant officers. In particular, plaintiffs had no direct proof that either of the two defendant officers knew that Chamberlin had instigated the special prosecutor's inquiry or that either plaintiff had testified to the grand jury, and both defendants denied knowing about who testified before the grand jury.</p>\n<p>Further, certain of the small administrative steps complained of by the plaintiffs could be taken as hostile or defended as consistent with regulations, so it is not easy to work backwards and conclusively infer a malign motive from the acts themselves. Other problems included the uncertainty as to significant compensable harm, lack of medical evidence of emotional harm, and the fact that Chamberlin was on leave during most of the events. This, then, looks like a suitable case for a jury to sort out cause, motive and effect; and when the jury got the claims against Cachopa, it rejected them on the merits.</p>\n<p>It is true that the district court let the case against Cachopa go to the jury in the second trial while it directed a verdict in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> Ciampa's favor in the first. But Cachopa was the chief when the principal incidents occurred; Ciampa was his creature as his effective deputy promoted to that spot over the heads of the lieutenants; and the most plausible case against both rested on the notion that they were cooperating to inflict petty misery on the plaintiffs, one of whom had supplanted Cachopa and the other of whom had failed to support him.</p>\n<p>The jury in the second trial was allowed to consider practically all of the claimed acts of retaliation. A number of these acts were done by Cachopa directly (changing the plaintiffs' shift and shirt colors; appointing Ciampa as executive officer over the heads of the lieutenants and reducing the plaintiffs' responsibilities; sending Chamberlin letters demanding doctor's notes). Others were, by Cachopa's own admission, done at his direction by his deputy, Ciampa (moving Chamberlin and Wohlgemuth to a different office; imposing various restrictions on Chamberlin for not requalifying with his firearm). A few acts were presented to the jury without clear evidence as to whether Cachopa or Ciampa was the primary actor (changing plaintiffs' training locations).</p>\n<p>In other words, for almost all the acts of alleged retaliation, Cachopa was either the principal actor or at least as culpable as Ciampa. Nonetheless, the jury found that Cachopa did not retaliate against the plaintiffs for protected conduct. The jury's determination that Cachopa was not liable \"fatally eviscerated\" the plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa and the defendants from the Town. <i>Earle v. Benoit,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508419\"><a href=\"/opinion/508419/james-earle-v-robert-benoit/\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 845 (1st Cir.1988).<sup>[5]</sup><i>Earle</i> is not conclusivethe fatal determination there was in the same trialbut the principle is the same, namely, that courts do not have further proceedings based on harmless errors.</p>\n<p>Appellate review after the grant of a directed verdict usually involves a measure of speculation about how the jury would have decided if a directed verdict had been denied; but no speculation is needed here because the same claims were effectively tried and lost in the second case. This is a rare occurrence and perhaps without precedent; but that should hardly prevent us from exercising common sense. Yes, the Seventh Amendment provides for jury trials; but, directed verdicts and harmless error are established qualifications (so too are waiver, stipulation and estoppel). Whether the case against Ciampa was fairly tested by the second trial is a separate question.</p>\n<p>A few alleged retaliatory actsfor which Ciampa and the Town were the primary actorswere not squarely presented to the jury in the second trial. After Ciampa became acting chief, he directed Chamberlin to undergo a medical examination to determine his fitness to return to duty; issued warnings to Wohlgemuth for comments made to other officers; and sent Wohlgemuth a letter about sick time abuse. These incidents not only fail as a retaliation claim, <i>cf. </i><i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532523\"><a href=\"/opinion/532523/maria-m-agosto-de-feliciano-v-awilda-aponte-roque-etc-maria-teresa/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1209</span></a></span>, 1218 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc), but add no real weight to the more serious incidents that occurred while Cachopa was chief.</p>\n<p>Thus, the medical examination was required for officers out of work for five days <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> or more due to off-duty injury or illness, and the dispute centered around a possible conflict of the policy with the union contract; Wohlgemuth did not seriously deny making some negative comments about other officers; and whether he marginally exceeded his sick time is unclear even after reading relevant testimony. By contrast, the list of alleged wrongful acts occurring while Cachopa was chief is far longer and included at least a few of some substance.<sup>[6]</sup> This is presumably why the court did not direct a verdict for Cachopa; even so, Cachopa prevailed.</p>\n<p>As for the Town, it was within its rights in filing suit against Chamberlin over his retirement incentive. Chamberlin did not retire as promised for whatever reason, and the Board could legitimately seek to enforce the agreement; engaging in protected conduct did not insulate Chamberlin from these consequences. <i>See </i><i>Blackie v. Maine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712176\"><a href=\"/opinion/712176/dana-blackie-v-state-of-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></a></span>, 723-24 (1st Cir.1996). According to Chamberlin's own testimony, the Board's desire that he retire predated much of the arguably protected conduct.</p>\n<p>Nowhere do plaintiffs explain how they could have prevailed against Ciampa when the jury rejected counterpart claims against Cachopa. Instead, they argue that the second trial was itself flawed: of their twelve claims in this court, eight assert errors in the second trial. Of course, the outcome of the second trial could not insulate defendants if it were itself flawed; but a number of the claims involve trial-court judgment calls about which little need be said and the most important of the challenged rulingsdiscussed nextdo not comprise reversible error.</p>\n<p>Most important, plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by excluding a report that the Town commissioned from attorney Marc Terry (the \"Terry Report\") in response to the plaintiffs' letters alleging a hostile work environment. Terry interviewed a number of witnesses regarding the plaintiffs' allegations and concluded that Cachopa had retaliated against the plaintiffs both for their cooperation with the grand jury investigation and for failing to support Cachopa's effort to remain as chief.</p>\n<p>In excluding the report, the district court stated, \"I think given its timing and given the fact that it was requested in July of 2004 and we don't get it until October of 2005 . . . . [and] given its level of generality, I think it's unduly prejudicial.\" The reference to timing is unclear to us and the reference to generality is perhaps confusing; the report was fairly detailed as to the underlying events. But in all likelihood the district court meant that the utility of the report to plaintiffs was its <i>final assessment,</i> which their brief underscores, that Cachopa was not credible in his denials as to what he did and why.</p>\n<p>Cachopa's credibility as to what he did and why was central to the second trial, but the underlying evidence of events bearing on that was available to the plaintiffs. To superimpose Terry's evaluation on what the jury was expected to decide served no useful purpose: it was the jury's task to decide whether to believe Cachopa. Terry was not qualified or offered as an expert on \"credibility\"; and to treat his independent judgment as evidence would simply weight one side of the scale to Cachopa's disadvantage.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> It thus does not matter whether Terry's report avoids a hearsay objection by virtue of Rule 803(8)(c) or otherwise;<sup>[7]</sup> Rule 403 independently permits exclusion of evidence that is unduly prejudicial and to exclude the report on this ground was not an abuse of discretion. This would be a different case if plaintiffs were pointing us to raw facts that Terry had uncovered and for which evidence was not readily available to plaintiffs themselves.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred by refusing to allow them to examine Cachopa over his role in the initial investigation of Cohen, whose conduct was the subject of the later inquiry by the special prosecutor and grand jury investigation. The plaintiffs claim that Cachopa opened the door to the issue by testifying that he himself had brought the matter before the district attorney in 2003, and that they were denied the chance to demonstrate fully Cachopa's misconduct in this matter.</p>\n<p>However, the transcript indicates that the district court did not flatly bar the plaintiffs from examining Cachopa on the Cohen investigation. Rather, Cachopa was the first witness to testify in the case, and the district court seemingly believed that the jury should first be apprised of any wrongs that Cachopa did to the plaintiffs before digressions into Cachopa's role in the Cohen matter. The court ruled that \"[y]ou better go to something that's relevant and then you can come back to this. You can come back to it . . . if it's relevant.\" The plaintiffs tried again several questions later, in response to which the court sustained an objection \"without prejudice to your returning to it.\"</p>\n<p>So far as appears, the plaintiffs made no effort to question Cachopa on the Cohen matter again. The Cohen matter, and Cachopa's conduct in relation to it, was arguably \"relevant\" under Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidencefor example, because it bore on his motivation to retaliate against Chamberlin for prompting an inquiry into the matter. But the district court \"enjoy[s] wide latitude in matters concerning the ordering of proof and the presentation of evidence,\" <i>Morales Feliciano v. Rullan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201178\"><a href=\"/opinion/201178/morales-felicianoet-v-john-a-rullan/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir. 2004), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Fajardo-Velez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789136\"><a href=\"/opinion/789136/miguel-diaz-seijo-v-victor-fajardo-velez-angel-melendez-osorio-rosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 56 (1st Cir.2005), which plaintiffs do not meet.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also challenge the district court's failure to instruct the jury that the plaintiffs' cooperation with the special prosecutor was protected under the First Amendment. As two senior officers in the police department, it was within the scope of both plaintiffs' duties to cooperate with the district attorney and the special prosecutor in investigating alleged criminal activity within the police department. Wohlgemuth shared responsibility for internal investigations, and Chamberlin had launched the investigation as part of his duties as chief. The district court correctly ruled that this conduct was not protected by the First Amendment under <i>Garcetti.</i></p>\n<p>We are not suggesting that <i>Garcetti</i> applies every time a police officer has conversations with a prosecutor. What constitutes official duties will necessarily vary with the circumstances including the rank of the officer, his areas of responsibility and the nature of the conversations; but in this case the facts just summarized are sufficient. The district court also instructed the jury that cooperation with the grand jury <i>was</i> protected speech; but this instruction, being favorable to plaintiffs, is not before us and need not be addressed.</p>\n<p>The district court also told the jury that the plaintiffs presented \"no medical testimony\" that distinguished emotional distress based on \"protected speech from the other divisiveness in the department,\" and \"you need such testimony.\" No per se rule requires expert testimony for an award of compensatory damages based on emotional distress, <i>e.g., </i><i>McDonough,</i> 452 F.3d at 22, but if there was error, it was harmless. The jury was told to award at least nominal damages if a protected speech violation occurred and did not do soso the predicate for any damages was absent.</p>\n<p>The remaining claims of trial error require no detailed discussion. The plaintiffs are wrong that the district court precluded proof of the shift changes and shirt color issue pressed by plaintiffs; the district court's restrictions on time allowed to each side were within the district court's authority; and a complained of comment by the district courtitself somewhat opaqueis not a basis for a new trial.</p>\n<p>The judgment is <i>affirmed.</i> Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>Although the majority affirms the district court's grant of a directed verdict<sup>[9]</sup> in favor of Ciampa, it does not do so on the familiar ground that no reasonable jury could find Ciampa liable for retaliation based on the evidence presented at the first trial. Instead, it concludes that any error in the granting of the directed verdict for Ciampa was \"harmless\" because of the rejection of plaintiffs' claims against Cachopa by a different jury in a subsequent trial. In my view, this harmless <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> error analysis is unprecedented and unsupportable. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the decision to affirm the directed verdict in favor of Ciampa.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Because it is important for understanding the flaws in the majority's harmless error analysis, I briefly summarize the relevant procedural history. In January 2008, plaintiffs proceeded to trial on their retaliation claims against Ciampa, Cachopa, and other defendants. Early in that trial, the court granted a mistrial on all claims against Cachopa. Plaintiffs continued to present evidence against the remaining defendants. At the close of their case, the court granted a directed verdict on all claims against Ciampa and the remaining defendants. Following the court's denial of plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration and for new trial, plaintiffs appealed. Several weeks later, plaintiffs proceeded to trial on their retaliation claims against Cachopa. Plaintiffs' allegations against Cachopa, although overlapping with their allegations against Ciampa, were not identical. The jury returned a verdict for Cachopa, and plaintiffs appealed from that verdict. Plaintiffs' two appeals, from the dispositions in the first and second trials, were later consolidated in the proceeding now before us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review de novo the district court's decision to grant a directed verdict. <i>Acevedo-Feliciano v. Ruiz-Hernández,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202208\"><a href=\"/opinion/202208/acevedo-feliciano-v-ruiz-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 121 (1st Cir.2006). The district court could properly grant a directed verdict for Ciampa at the close of plaintiffs' case in the first trial only if, based on the evidence presented at the time of its ruling, \"a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for [plaintiffs].\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). In our review of the grant of a directed verdict, we apply the same standard as the district court. <i>Id.</i> We must \"examine the evidence and all fair inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff[s] and may not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). Viewing the evidence in this light, we may uphold the directed verdict for Ciampa only if no reasonable jury could find defendant liable based on the evidence presented by plaintiffs at the first trial. <i>See </i><i>Acevedo-Feliciano,</i> 447 F.3d at 121.</p>\n<p>In order to prevail on their retaliation claims, plaintiffs had to show that they \"engaged in constitutionally protected conduct and that this conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the alleged adverse employment action.\" <i>Welch v. Ciampa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203489\"><a href=\"/opinion/203489/welch-v-ciampa/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span>, 936 (1st Cir.2008). The majority acknowledges that plaintiffs engaged in arguably constitutionally protected conduct, that the adverse actions by Cachopa and Ciampa, viewed collectively, were arguably harmful enough to support a viable claim, that the parties proffered conflicting evidence as to motive, and that this was \"a suitable case for the jury to sort out cause, motive and effect.\" However, having recognized these central disputes suitable for jury determination, the majority does not then evaluate the directed verdict on the merits, assessing whether a reasonable jury could find Ciampa liable based on the evidence presented at the first trial. Instead, the majority looks to the second trial, in which Ciampa was not a party, and views that trial as a proxy for what would have happened if plaintiffs' claims had gone to the jury in the first trial. The majority concludes that even if <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> the district court erred in directing a verdict for Ciampa, any error was harmless, because similar retaliation claims against <i>Cachopa</i> went to a jury in the second trial and that jury ultimately found in his favor. None of the parties raised this harmless error argument in their briefing.<sup>[11]</sup> That is not surprising. There is no precedent for such an application of harmless error.</p>\n<p>As a general matter, under the harmless error rule, we disregard \"errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2111; <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 61. In the ordinary harmless error case, an error made in the proceedings leading up to the final judgmentfor example, an erroneous evidentiary ruling is deemed harmless to the ultimate disposition.</p>\n<p>In certain narrow factual circumstances, courts have concluded that an error in the <i>final disposition</i>for example, an erroneous directed verdictwas harmless in light of subsequent proceedings. For example, in <i>Earle v. Benoit,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508419\"><a href=\"/opinion/508419/james-earle-v-robert-benoit/\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 840 (1st Cir.1988), the primary authority relied on by the majority for its harmless error analysis, the plaintiff, Earle, alleged that defendant police officers had conspired to deprive him of his civil rights by subjecting him to unlawful arrest, illegal searches, excessive force, and other harassment. At the close of Earle's case before the jury, the court directed a verdict in favor of defendants on Earle's conspiracy claim, but permitted his other claims to go to the jury. <i>Id.</i> at 837. That jury ultimately returned a verdict for defendants, responding negatively to special jury questions regarding whether the alleged unlawful arrest, illegal searches, and use of excessive force violated Earle's civil rights. <i>Id.</i> at 845.</p>\n<p>The <i>Earle</i> court concluded that the directed verdict was erroneously granted because \"there was sufficient circumstantial evidence (had the jury found in Earle's favor on the substantive claims) for a reasonable jury to have inferred a conspiracy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 844. Nevertheless, this error was harmless because a § 1983 conspiracy requires an \"actual deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws,\" and therefore the jury's ultimate rejection of Earle's underlying civil rights claims \"fatally eviscerated Earle's conspiracy claim.\" <i>Id.</i> at 845 (internal quotation marks omitted).<sup>[12]</sup> The court reasoned that, in a real and practical sense, even if the district court had permitted Earle's conspiracy claim to go to the jury, that claim would have been rejected by the jury. Given the jury's findings on Earle's claims of significant civil rights violations, the jury could not have also found defendants liable for a civil rights conspiracy. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, \"as a practical matter,\" in light of the jury's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> consistent rejection of Earle's civil rights claims, it was \"inconceivable\" that \"the jury would have found for plaintiff on the closely related conspiracy charge.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Goulet v. New Penn Motor Express, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203094\"><a href=\"/opinion/203094/goulet-v-new-penn-motor-exp-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2008) (finding wrongly directed verdict harmless \"where the jury's ultimate verdict <i>necessarily defeats</i> the claim\" on which directed verdict was erroneously granted (emphasis added)).<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>As I explain more fully below, this case is fundamentally different from <i>Earle</i> for two reasons. First, the directed verdict for Ciampa and the jury verdict for Cachopa occurred not in a single trial, but in two separate trials that culminated in two separate appeals. Second, given the nature of plaintiffs' claims and the particular facts of this case, the jury verdict for Cachopa did not necessarily defeat plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>In <i>Earle,</i> as noted, the directed verdict and the ultimate jury verdict occurred in the course of a <i>single</i> trial proceeding. Thus, the <i>Earle</i> court concluded that given the jury's findings on Earle's underlying civil rights claims, that jury could not have rationally found for Earle on his conspiracy claim. Here, of course, the directed verdict on plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa and the jury's rejection of plaintiffs' claims against Cachopa occurred during two <i>separate</i> trial proceedings, which culminated in separate dispositions and separate appeals. In the first trial, following the court's grant of a mistrial on all claims against Cachopa, the court directed a verdict on all remaining claims against Ciampa and the other defendants. Thus, <i>none</i> of plaintiffs' claims reached a jury in the first trial. In the second trial, plaintiffs' claims against Cachopa were tried by a jury, and that jury found for Cachopa.</p>\n<p>Although the majority glosses over this somewhat odd procedural history, it cannot be ignored. Here, unlike in <i>Earle</i> and similar cases, we cannot say with any certainty how the first jury would have decided plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa if the directed verdict had not been granted, because that jury made no findings on any of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> plaintiffs' claims. Without any findings by the first jury, we have no basis for concluding that the first jury could not have rationally found for plaintiffs on their claims against Ciampa. We cannot say, as the <i>Earle</i> court did, that if the district court had not granted the directed verdict, the jury necessarily would have rejected plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa.</p>\n<p>My concerns with the majority's unique harmless error analysis are further heightened by its constitutional implications. Under the Seventh Amendment, plaintiffs have a right to a jury trial on their claims for legal relief under § 1983.<sup>[14]</sup><i>City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118291\"><a href=\"/opinion/118291/monterey-v-del-monte-dunes-at-monterey-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 709-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118291\"><a href=\"/opinion/118291/monterey-v-del-monte-dunes-at-monterey-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">882</span></a></span> (1999). Of course, it is well-established that the proper grant of a directed verdict does not offend a party's Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. <i>Galloway v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103846\"><a href=\"/opinion/103846/galloway-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span>, 389, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1458</span></span> (1943); 9B Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> § 2522 (3d ed.2008). The directed verdict procedure is constitutional because a properly granted directed verdict \"only deprives the losing party of the possibility of an unreasonable verdict, a possibility not protected by the Constitution.\" Wright &amp; Miller, <i>supra,</i> § 2522. The analysis applied in <i>Earle,</i> although styled as a harmless error analysis, is a variant on this principle. The <i>Earle</i> court found that, in light of the jury's finding on the underlying civil rights claims, the jury could not rationally find for plaintiff on his conspiracy claim. Thus, the court's decision to withdraw Earle's conspiracy claim from the jury did not violate any right to a jury trial because it only deprived Earle of the possibility of an irrational verdict.</p>\n<p>Here, however, the majority does <i>not</i> hold, under either the traditional directed verdict analysis or the <i>Earle</i> harmless error analysis, that the directed verdict for Ciampa in the first trial only deprived plaintiffs of the possibility of an unreasonable verdict at the hands of the first jury. On the contrary, the majority acknowledges that plaintiffs presented evidence at the first trial that was arguably sufficient for the jury to find Ciampa liable for retaliation. In these circumstances, the decision not to allow plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa to be heard by the jury, and to affirm the directed verdict in favor of Ciampa, implicates plaintiffs' Seventh Amendment rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Even if the directed verdict for Ciampa and the jury verdict for Cachopa had occurred in the course of a single trial, <i>Earle</i> and similar cases would not support a finding of harmless error here. On the facts of this case, as set forth by the majority, it is clear that the jury verdict for Cachopa did not \"necessarily defeat[]\" plaintiffs' claims against Ciampa. <i>Goulet,</i> 512 F.3d at 43. Instead, for a variety of reasons, a rational jury could logically reject plaintiffs' retaliation claims against Cachopa, but at the same time uphold plaintiffs' retaliation claims against Ciampa.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>For example, a rational jury could have reached different conclusions about Ciampa and Cachopa on the issue of motive. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> Plaintiffs' retaliation claims required a showing that Ciampa, Cachopa, or both took adverse actions motivated at least in part by plaintiffs' protected conduct. <i>See </i><i>Welch,</i> 542 F.3d at 936. The inquiry into motive is highly individualized and fact-specific, requiring an evaluation of the defendant officers' actual, subjective intent. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz Velez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783291\"><a href=\"/opinion/783291/santos-rivera-torres-daisy-nazario-santana-conjugal-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 97 (1st Cir.2003) (explaining that \"subjective intent <i>is</i> an essential element\" of analogous political discrimination claim under First Amendment). As the majority acknowledges, there was a central dispute in this case on the element of motive plaintiffs' case as to retaliatory motive \"rested primarily on soft inference as against flat denials\" by Ciampa and Cachopa, and in particular, both defendant officers denied knowing who had testified before the grand jury. A rational jury could well find, based on its assessment of the defendant officers' credibility or for other reasons, that Ciampa and Cachopa had different levels of knowledge about plaintiffs' protected conduct or otherwise had different subjective motives for their actions.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the alleged retaliatory acts by the two defendant officers, although overlapping, were not identical. As the majority acknowledges, plaintiffs also alleged some retaliatory acts \"for which Ciampa [was] the primary actor[];\" these \"were not squarely presented to the jury in the second trial.\" For example, plaintiffs alleged that Ciampa took several retaliatory acts during the period he served as acting police chief; those acts included directing Chamberlin to undergo a medical examination and issuing letters of warning to Wohlgemuth that were placed in his personnel file.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>The majority, relying on <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532523\"><a href=\"/opinion/532523/maria-m-agosto-de-feliciano-v-awilda-aponte-roque-etc-maria-teresa/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1209</span></a></span>, 1218 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc), asserts that these additional acts by Ciampa do not rise to the level of adverse employment actions sufficient to sustain a retaliation claim. However, as the majority acknowledges, plaintiffs' central claim against the defendant officers was that they carried on \"a systematic campaign of retaliatory harassment\" against plaintiffs in 2004 and 2005. For purposes of evaluating whether this campaign of harassment rose to the level of an adverse employment action, the acts of harassment cannot be isolated and analyzed separately. Instead, the trier of fact must determine whether the course of harassment, taken as a whole, \"result[ed] in a work situation `unreasonably inferior' to the norm for the position.\" <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano,</i> 889 F.2d at 1218; <i>accord </i><i>Welch,</i> 542 F.3d at 937. Given the somewhat different evidence of harassment by the two defendant officers, a jury could reasonably find that the actions by Cachopa did not amount to a campaign of retaliatory harassment, but the somewhat different actions by Ciampa did.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>In this case, the majority declines to evaluate the directed verdict for Ciampa under the well-established standardassessing whether, viewing the evidence presented at the first trial in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, no reasonable jury could find Ciampa liable for retaliation. Indeed, the majority effectively acknowledges that if it did apply the proper standard, focusing on the evidence before the district court at the time of its ruling, the majority would have to conclude that the directed verdict for Ciampa was erroneously <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> granted and remand the case for a new trial. To avoid that result, the majority turns to a harmless error analysis. However, for the reasons discussed above, the majority is also unable to engage in the harmless analysis conducted in <i>Earle. Earle</i> and similar cases do not support a finding of harmless error where, as here, the directed verdict and the subsequent jury verdict occurred in the course of two separate trial proceedings, as to two different defendants, and as to somewhat different allegations.</p>\n<p>In the end, the majority resorts to affirming based on its impression, from the paper record, that Cachopa was at least as culpable as Ciampa, that the jury in the second trial rejected plaintiffs' claims against Cachopa, and that remanding for a new trial on the claims against Ciampa would therefore be pointless. I cannot join in this reasoning, particularly where plaintiffs' constitutional right to a jury trial is implicated. The district court's grant of a directed verdict cannot be affirmed simply because the majority feels as a matter of rough justice that a remand would be a waste of time.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Those grounds included a lack of compensable damages, coupled with a lack of evil motive or intent sufficient to award punitive damages; the fact that many of the alleged retaliatory acts took place prior to the December hostile work environment letters; a lack of knowledge by the defendants of the plaintiffs' grand jury testimony; a lack of retaliatory acts by the Selectmen or Ciampa; and a lack of a policy or custom of retaliation by the Town. The district court said, however, that it did not adopt in full the defendants' reading of current First Amendment doctrine.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Connick v.

We refer to the district court's ruling as a directed verdict to remain consistent with the majority's terminology.</p>\n<p>[10]  I join the majority's decision in all other respects.</p>\n<p>[11]  Instead, defendants contended in their briefing, in the traditional manner, that no reasonable jury could find for plaintiffs on their retaliation claims based on the evidence presented at the first trial, and therefore the directed verdict was properly granted. Defendants contended, inter alia, that there was no evidence Ciampa or Cachopa knew that plaintiffs cooperated with the special prosecutor or testified before the grand jury, and that any retaliation that occurred after plaintiffs' December 2004 hostile work environment letters did not rise to the level of an adverse employment action. The only suggestion by defendants of an argument even resembling the majority's harmless error analysis is their statement, in a footnote, that \"the jury verdict in Cachopa's favor in Trial Two further supports the reasonableness of the Court's entry of a Directed Verdict in Trial One.\"</p>\n<p>[12]  The court acknowledged that Earle provided evidence of other more trivial confrontations with police, such as being stopped for alleged traffic violations, but concluded that no jury could have found that any of these incidents constituted a deprivation of a constitutional right, as required for a § 1983 civil rights conspiracy. <i>Id.</i> at 845.</p>\n<p>[13]  My research has uncovered a smattering of other cases, from our own circuit and others, applying harmless error analysis to a directed verdict. Like <i>Earle,</i> these decisions have found harmless error where the jury verdict \"necessarily defeats the claim\" on which a directed verdict was incorrectly granted. <i>Goulet,</i> 512 F.3d at 43; <i>see id.</i> at 42-43 (concluding that any error in directed verdict for employer on plaintiff's hybrid Labor Management Relations Act § 301 claim was harmless, where the jury's ultimate rejection of plaintiff's § 301 claim against union was \"fatal\" to claim against employer); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Uphoff Figueroa v.
