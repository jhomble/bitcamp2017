This is an appeal from  a final\n                          \n\njudgment  determining  the  copyright  ownership  of  certain\n\nunpublished  tape  recordings  of  the  musical  group George\n\nThorogood  and the  Destroyers  (the \"Band\").   The  district\n\ncourt ruled that the Band held the copyright to the tapes and\n\nenjoined appellant John Forward from making commercial use of\n\nthe recordings.  We affirm.\n\n     The basic facts  can be  briefly stated.   Forward is  a\n\nmusic aficionado and record collector with a special interest\n\nin  blues and country music.  In 1975, Forward was working as\n\na  bus driver  when  he  first  met  Thorogood  at  a  Boston\n\nnightclub  where  the  Band  was  performing.    Forward  was\n\nimmediately  taken  with  the  Band's  act  and  struck  up a\n\nfriendship  with Thorogood.   Thorogood  and his  fellow band\n\nmembers,  a drummer  and  a guitar  player, had  been playing\n\ntogether at East Coast colleges and clubs since 1973.\n\n     Upon learning that the Band had yet to release its first\n\nalbum, Forward  began a campaign  to persuade his  friends at\n\nRounder Records to  sign the  Band to  a recording  contract.\n\nRounder  Records  is  a small,  Boston-based  record  company\n\nspecializing  in blues  and  folk music.    As part  of  this\n\neffort, Forward arranged and  paid for two recording sessions\n\nfor  the Band in  1976.  The  purpose of the  sessions was to\n\ncreate  a \"demo\"  tape  that would  capture Rounder  Records'\n\ninterest.  At  Forward's invitation, one of the principals of\n\n                             -2-\n\nRounder Records attended the Band's second recording session.\n\nOther   than  requesting  specific   songs  to  be  recorded,\n\nForward's  contribution  to  the  sessions  was  limited   to\n\narranging and paying for them. \n\n     Rounder Records was impressed by  what it heard; the day\n\nafter the second session,  it arranged to sign the Band  to a\n\ncontract.   The Band agreed that Forward could keep the tapes\n\nfor  his  own  enjoyment,  and  they  have  remained  in  his\n\npossession ever since.   In 1977, the Band's first  album was\n\nreleased  under  the  Rounder  Records label.    Forward  was\n\nsingled   out   for   \"special   thanks\"   in   the   album's\n\nacknowledgements.  Since then,  Thorogood and  the Destroyers\n\nhave  released a  number of  records and  gone on  to achieve\n\nsuccess as a blues/rock band. \n\n     The  dispute between  the parties  arose in  early 1988,\n\nwhen Forward told  the Band that he intended to sell the 1976\n\ntapes to a record  company for commercial release.   The Band\n\nobjected, fearing  that release of  the tapes would  harm its\n\nreputation;  they   were,  the   district  court  found,   of\n\n\"relatively   primitive  quality\"  compared   to  the  Band's\n\npublished work.  On  July 5, 1988, Forward filed  suit in the\n\ndistrict court,  seeking a declaratory judgment  that he held\n\nthe  common law  copyright to  the tapes.   Determination  of\n\ncopyright  ownership  is  governed   by  the  common  law  of\n\ncopyright because the tapes are unpublished and were recorded\n\n                             -3-\n\nin 1976, prior to the January 1, 1978, effective  date of the\n\nCopyright  Act of 1976,  17 U.S.C.    101 et seq.1   The Band\n                                                \n\nresponded with a counterclaim for declaratory and  injunctive\n\nrelief.\n\n     In  the district  court,  Forward advanced  a number  of\n\ntheories  in support  of  his claim  to copyright  ownership.\n\nAfter a five-day  bench trial, the  district court filed  its\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law,  ruling that Forward\n\ndid  not  hold the  copyright under  any  of the  theories he\n\nadvanced.  Forward v.  Thorogood, 758 F. Supp. 782  (D. Mass.\n                                \n\n1991).   The court  entered judgment for  the Band, declaring\n\nThorogood and other  Band members to be  the copyright owners\n\nand   permanently   enjoining   Forward   from   commercially\n\nexploiting the tapes.  Forward now appeals.\n\n     On this appeal, Forward's first theory in support of his\n\nclaim of copyright  ownership is based  on his ownership  and\n\npossession of the tapes.  According to  Forward, ownership of\n\na  copyrightable  work  carries  with  it  ownership  of  the\n\ncopyright.    Alternatively,  he  argues  that  the  evidence\n\nmandated  a   finding  that  the  copyright   was  implicitly\n\n                    \n\n     1See  M. Nimmer  &amp; D.  Nimmer, 1  Nimmer on  Copyright  \n                                                           \n2.10[A] n.18, at 2-147  (1992) (\"Nimmer\").

(1976  Act,  which\n        \npreempts the common law  of copyright as of January  1, 1978,\ndetermines  the rights but not the  identity of the copyright\nowners  of works created  prior to that  date), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n464 U.S. 961 (1983).\n\n                             -4-\n\ntransferred to  him along with  the demo tapes.   We  find no\n\nmerit in either claim.\n\n     The creator  of a work  is, at least  presumptively, its\n\nauthor and the owner of the copyright, Community for Creative\n                                                             \n\nNon-Violence  v.  Reid,  490  U.S.  730,  737  (1989).    The\n                      \n\nperformer of a musical work is the author, as it were, of the\n\nperformance.    1 Nimmer    2.10[A](2)(a),  at   2-149.   The\n                        \n\ncourts, in applying  the common  law of copyright,  did in  a\n\nnumber  of cases  infer  from  an  unconditional  sale  of  a\n\nmanuscript or  painting an intent to  transfer the copyright.\n\n3  Nimmer    10.09[B],  at  10-76.1.    This doctrine,  often\n         \n\ncriticized  and  subject  to various  judicial  and statutory\n\nexclusions, id., is the  source of Forward's principal claim.\n              \n\nThe difficulty  for Forward is  that even under  the doctrine\n\nthis physical  transfer merely created a  presumption and the\n\nultimate question was one of intent.  Id.\n                                        \n\n     In this  case, the district court  found that \"[n]either\n\nthe band nor  any of its members ever  conveyed, or agreed to\n\nconvey, their copyright interest  in the  tapes  to Forward.\"\n\n758 F. Supp. at 784.  Rather the Band allowed Forward to keep\n\nthe  tapes solely for his personal enjoyment.  Id.  Forward's\n                                                 \n\ndisregard  of this  central finding is  premised on  a highly\n\nartificial attempt to claim \"constructive possession\"  of the\n\ntapes  from the outset and then to argue that any reservation\n\nby the Band at the end of the sessions was an invalid attempt\n\n                             -5-\n\nto  reconvey or qualify his  copyright.  The  reality is that\n\nthe Band never  surrendered the copyright in the  first place\n\nand the transfer of the tapes' ownership to Forward was not a\n\nsharply defined  event distinct  from the reservation  of the\n\nBand's rights.\n\n     Forward  argues that  the  district  court's finding  is\n\nmistaken, pointing  in particular  to a  1979 check for  $500\n\nmade  out to him from Rounder Records  on behalf of the Band.\n\nA  notation indicates  that  the check  was  for an  \"advance\n\noption\"  on  the tapes,  and  Forward argues  that  the check\n\nconstitutes  an  \"unambiguous admission\"  that  he owned  the\n\ncopyright.   The Band  counters that, shortly  before Forward\n\nwas given the check, another  demo tape made by the  Band had\n\nbeen  sold by a  third party to  a record company.   The Band\n\nclaims that, to prevent  another such misadventure, it sought\n\nan  option on the physical  tapes held by  Forward.  Although\n\nForward contests  this explanation, the  district court heard\n\nthe evidence, chose reasonably between conflicting inferences\n\nas to the  import of the  check, and that is  the end of  the\n\nmatter.  See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564,\n                                              \n\n573-74 (1985); Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\n\n     Forward's  second theory of copyright ownership involves\n\nthe  \"works  for hire\"  doctrine.    Under this  doctrine,  a\n\njudicially developed  notion later codified  in the Copyright\n\nAct of 1909, 17 U.S.C.   1 et seq., an employer is deemed the\n                                 \n\n                             -6-\n\n\"author\"  and  copyright  holder  of  a work  created  by  an\n\nemployee  acting within  the scope  of employment.   Although\n\ninitially  confined  to  the   traditional  employer-employee\n\nrelationship, the  doctrine  has  been  expanded  to  include\n\ncommissioned  works created by  independent contractors, with\n\ncourts treating the contractor as an employee and  creating a\n\npresumption of copyright ownership in the commissioning party\n\nat  whose \"instance  and expense\"  the work  was done.   See,\n                                                             \n\ne.g.,  Murray v.  Gelderman, 566  F.2d. 1307, 1310  (5th Cir.\n                           \n\n1978);  Brattleboro  Publishing  Co.  v.  Winmill  Publishing\n                                                             \n\nCorp., 369  F.2d  565,  567-68  (2d  Cir.  1966).2    Forward\n     \n\nmaintains  that  the  tapes,  created at  his  \"instance  and\n\nexpense,\"  are  commissioned  works  to which  he  holds  the\n\ncopyright.\n\n     The district court rejected this claim, finding that the\n\nevidence did not support  it.  The court said  that, although\n\nForward booked  and  paid for  the  studio time,  he  neither\n\nemployed  nor  commissioned  the  band  members  nor  did  he\n\ncompensate or agree to compensate them.  758 F. Supp. at 784.\n\nWhile  the lack  of compensation  may  not be  decisive, see,\n                                                             \n\ne.g., Community  for Creative  Non-Violence, 490 U.S.  at 734\n                                           \n\n                    \n\n     2    The  Copyright Act  of 1976  altered the  works for\nhire  doctrine so  that  only certain  types of  commissioned\nworks qualify as works for hire, and then only if the parties\nhave  agreed in writing  to treat it as  such.  See Community\n                                                             \nfor Creative  Non-Violence,  490  U.S.  at 738.    The  Act's\n                          \nprovisions on works for hire operate prospectively and do not\ngovern this case.\n\n                             -7-\n\n(donated commissioned  work), the  evidence as a  whole amply\n\nsupports the trial judge's conclusion.  Nothing suggests that\n\nthe tapes were prepared  for the use and benefit  of Forward.\n\nRather, the purpose  was to  provide demo tapes  to entice  a\n\nrecording company.  Forward was a fan and friend who fostered\n\nthis effort,  not the  Archbishop of  Saltzburg commissioning\n\nworks by Mozart.\n\n     Finally, Forward argues that he  is at least a  co-owner\n\nof  the copyright as a \"joint author\" of the tape recordings.\n\nThe doctrine  of joint authorship, recognized  at common law,\n\nis incorporated in  the current  Copyright Act of  1976.   17\n\nU.S.C.    201(a).  In  appraising this claim,  our concern is\n\nwith Forward's  musical or artistic contribution  rather than\n\nhis encouragement to the Band or his logistical support.  \n\n     The district  court found that \"Forward  made no musical\n\nor  artistic  contribution\"  to  the  tapes, explaining  that\n\nForward  did not  serve as  the engineer  at the  sessions or\n\ndirect the manner  in which  the songs were  played or  sung.\n\n758 F. Supp. at 784.  The trial judge noted  that Forward did\n\nrequest that  certain  songs be  played  but \"the  band  then\n\nplayed  those songs  in  precisely the  same  manner that  it\n\nalways played them.\"   Id.  The district court's  concise and\n                         \n\nunqualified findings are fully supported by the evidence\n\n     Forward  has only one legal prop  for his contrary claim\n\nand it is a weak one.   In the House Report on the  Copyright\n\n                             -8-\n\nAct of 1976,  the committee  observed that  the copyright  in\n\nsound  recordings \"will usually,  though not  always, involve\n\n`authorship' both  . . .  [by the  artist and by]  the record\n\nproducer  responsible for  setting up the  recording session,\n\ncapturing  and  electronically  processing  the  sounds,  and\n\ncompiling  and   editing  them   to  make  the   final  sound\n\nrecording.\"  H.  Rep. No.  94-1476, 94th Cong.,  2d Sess.  56\n\n(1976).  It is apparent from this passage that the \"producer\"\n\nenvisaged by the committee is one who engages in artistically\n\nsupervising  and editing  the  production.   See generally  1\n                                                          \n\nNimmer   2.10[A](2)(b), at  2-150 to 2-151.  That  is exactly\n      \n\nwhat Forward did not do in this case.  \n\n     The Band has sought an award of attorney's fees expended\n\nin this  court, arguing  that Forward's appeal  is frivolous.\n\nWe think that  the appeal comes  very close to  the line  but\n\ndoes not quite step over it and therefore deny the motion.\n\n     Affirmed.  \n             \n\n                             -9-\n",

This is an appeal from  a final\n                          \n\njudgment  determining  the  copyright  ownership  of  certain\n\nunpublished  tape  recordings  of  the  musical  group George\n\nThorogood  and the  Destroyers  (the \"Band\").   The  district\n\ncourt ruled that the Band held the copyright to the tapes and\n\nenjoined appellant John Forward from making commercial use of\n\nthe recordings.  We affirm.\n\n     The basic facts  can be  briefly stated.   Forward is  a\n\nmusic aficionado and record collector with a special interest\n\nin  blues and country music.  In 1975, Forward was working as\n\na  bus driver  when  he  first  met  Thorogood  at  a  Boston\n\nnightclub  where  the  Band  was  performing.    Forward  was\n\nimmediately  taken  with  the  Band's  act  and  struck  up a\n\nfriendship  with Thorogood.   Thorogood  and his  fellow band\n\nmembers,  a drummer  and  a guitar  player, had  been playing\n\ntogether at East Coast colleges and clubs since 1973.\n\n     Upon learning that the Band had yet to release its first\n\nalbum, Forward  began a campaign  to persuade his  friends at\n\nRounder Records to  sign the  Band to  a recording  contract.\n\nRounder  Records  is  a small,  Boston-based  record  company\n\nspecializing  in blues  and  folk music.    As part  of  this\n\neffort, Forward arranged and  paid for two recording sessions\n\nfor  the Band in  1976.  The  purpose of the  sessions was to\n\ncreate  a \"demo\"  tape  that would  capture Rounder  Records'\n\ninterest.  At  Forward's invitation, one of the principals of\n\n                             -2-\n\nRounder Records attended the Band's second recording session.\n\nOther   than  requesting  specific   songs  to  be  recorded,\n\nForward's  contribution  to  the  sessions  was  limited   to\n\narranging and paying for them. \n\n     Rounder Records was impressed by  what it heard; the day\n\nafter the second session,  it arranged to sign the Band  to a\n\ncontract.   The Band agreed that Forward could keep the tapes\n\nfor  his  own  enjoyment,  and  they  have  remained  in  his\n\npossession ever since.   In 1977, the Band's first  album was\n\nreleased  under  the  Rounder  Records label.    Forward  was\n\nsingled   out   for   \"special   thanks\"   in   the   album's\n\nacknowledgements.  Since then,  Thorogood and  the Destroyers\n\nhave  released a  number of  records and  gone on  to achieve\n\nsuccess as a blues/rock band. \n\n     The  dispute between  the parties  arose in  early 1988,\n\nwhen Forward told  the Band that he intended to sell the 1976\n\ntapes to a record  company for commercial release.   The Band\n\nobjected, fearing  that release of  the tapes would  harm its\n\nreputation;  they   were,  the   district  court  found,   of\n\n\"relatively   primitive  quality\"  compared   to  the  Band's\n\npublished work.  On  July 5, 1988, Forward filed  suit in the\n\ndistrict court,  seeking a declaratory judgment  that he held\n\nthe  common law  copyright to  the tapes.   Determination  of\n\ncopyright  ownership  is  governed   by  the  common  law  of\n\ncopyright because the tapes are unpublished and were recorded\n\n                             -3-\n\nin 1976, prior to the January 1, 1978, effective  date of the\n\nCopyright  Act of 1976,  17 U.S.C.    101 et seq.1   The Band\n                                                \n\nresponded with a counterclaim for declaratory and  injunctive\n\nrelief.\n\n     In  the district  court,  Forward advanced  a number  of\n\ntheories  in support  of  his claim  to copyright  ownership.\n\nAfter a five-day  bench trial, the  district court filed  its\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law,  ruling that Forward\n\ndid  not  hold the  copyright under  any  of the  theories he\n\nadvanced.

The court  entered judgment for  the Band, declaring\n\nThorogood and other  Band members to be  the copyright owners\n\nand   permanently   enjoining   Forward   from   commercially\n\nexploiting the tapes.  Forward now appeals.\n\n     On this appeal, Forward's first theory in support of his\n\nclaim of copyright  ownership is based  on his ownership  and\n\npossession of the tapes.  According to  Forward, ownership of\n\na  copyrightable  work  carries  with  it  ownership  of  the\n\ncopyright.    Alternatively,  he  argues  that  the  evidence\n\nmandated  a   finding  that  the  copyright   was  implicitly\n\n                    \n\n     1See  M. Nimmer  &amp; D.

The\n                      \n\nperformer of a musical work is the author, as it were, of the\n\nperformance.    1 Nimmer    2.10[A](2)(a),  at   2-149.   The\n                        \n\ncourts, in applying  the common  law of copyright,  did in  a\n\nnumber  of cases  infer  from  an  unconditional  sale  of  a\n\nmanuscript or  painting an intent to  transfer the copyright.\n\n3  Nimmer    10.09[B],  at  10-76.1.    This doctrine,  often\n         \n\ncriticized  and  subject  to various  judicial  and statutory\n\nexclusions, id., is the  source of Forward's principal claim.\n              \n\nThe difficulty  for Forward is  that even under  the doctrine\n\nthis physical  transfer merely created a  presumption and the\n\nultimate question was one of intent.  Id.\n                                        \n\n     In this  case, the district court  found that \"[n]either\n\nthe band nor  any of its members ever  conveyed, or agreed to\n\nconvey, their copyright interest  in the  tapes  to Forward.\"\n\n758 F. Supp. at 784.  Rather the Band allowed Forward to keep\n\nthe  tapes solely for his personal enjoyment.  Id.  Forward's\n                                                 \n\ndisregard  of this  central finding is  premised on  a highly\n\nartificial attempt to claim \"constructive possession\"  of the\n\ntapes  from the outset and then to argue that any reservation\n\nby the Band at the end of the sessions was an invalid attempt\n\n                             -5-\n\nto  reconvey or qualify his  copyright.  The  reality is that\n\nthe Band never  surrendered the copyright in the  first place\n\nand the transfer of the tapes' ownership to Forward was not a\n\nsharply defined  event distinct  from the reservation  of the\n\nBand's rights.\n\n     Forward  argues that  the  district  court's finding  is\n\nmistaken, pointing  in particular  to a  1979 check for  $500\n\nmade  out to him from Rounder Records  on behalf of the Band.\n\nA  notation indicates  that  the check  was  for an  \"advance\n\noption\"  on  the tapes,  and  Forward argues  that  the check\n\nconstitutes  an  \"unambiguous admission\"  that  he owned  the\n\ncopyright.   The Band  counters that, shortly  before Forward\n\nwas given the check, another  demo tape made by the  Band had\n\nbeen  sold by a  third party to  a record company.   The Band\n\nclaims that, to prevent  another such misadventure, it sought\n\nan  option on the physical  tapes held by  Forward.  Although\n\nForward contests  this explanation, the  district court heard\n\nthe evidence, chose reasonably between conflicting inferences\n\nas to the  import of the  check, and that is  the end of  the\n\nmatter.

City of Bessemer City, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                              \n\n573-74 (1985); Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\n\n     Forward's  second theory of copyright ownership involves\n\nthe  \"works  for hire\"  doctrine.    Under this  doctrine,  a\n\njudicially developed  notion later codified  in the Copyright\n\nAct of 1909, 17 U.S.C.   1 et seq., an employer is deemed the\n                                 \n\n                             -6-\n\n\"author\"  and  copyright  holder  of  a work  created  by  an\n\nemployee  acting within  the scope  of employment.   Although\n\ninitially  confined  to  the   traditional  employer-employee\n\nrelationship, the  doctrine  has  been  expanded  to  include\n\ncommissioned  works created by  independent contractors, with\n\ncourts treating the contractor as an employee and  creating a\n\npresumption of copyright ownership in the commissioning party\n\nat  whose \"instance  and expense\"  the work  was done.

The court said  that, although\n\nForward booked  and  paid for  the  studio time,  he  neither\n\nemployed  nor  commissioned  the  band  members  nor  did  he\n\ncompensate or agree to compensate them.  758 F. Supp. at 784.\n\nWhile  the lack  of compensation  may  not be  decisive, see,\n                                                             \n\ne.g., Community  for Creative  Non-Violence, 490 U.S.  at 734\n                                           \n\n                    \n\n     2    The  Copyright Act  of 1976  altered the  works for\nhire  doctrine so  that  only certain  types of  commissioned\nworks qualify as works for hire, and then only if the parties\nhave  agreed in writing  to treat it as  such.  See Community\n                                                             \nfor Creative  Non-Violence,  490  U.S.  at 738.    The  Act's\n                          \nprovisions on works for hire operate prospectively and do not\ngovern this case.\n\n                             -7-\n\n(donated commissioned  work), the  evidence as a  whole amply\n\nsupports the trial judge's conclusion.  Nothing suggests that\n\nthe tapes were prepared  for the use and benefit  of Forward.\n\nRather, the purpose  was to  provide demo tapes  to entice  a\n\nrecording company.  Forward was a fan and friend who fostered\n\nthis effort,  not the  Archbishop of  Saltzburg commissioning\n\nworks by Mozart.\n\n     Finally, Forward argues that he  is at least a  co-owner\n\nof  the copyright as a \"joint author\" of the tape recordings.\n\nThe doctrine  of joint authorship, recognized  at common law,\n\nis incorporated in  the current  Copyright Act of  1976.   17\n\nU.S.C.    201(a).  In  appraising this claim,  our concern is\n\nwith Forward's  musical or artistic contribution  rather than\n\nhis encouragement to the Band or his logistical support.  \n\n     The district  court found that \"Forward  made no musical\n\nor  artistic  contribution\"  to  the  tapes, explaining  that\n\nForward  did not  serve as  the engineer  at the  sessions or\n\ndirect the manner  in which  the songs were  played or  sung.\n\n758 F. Supp. at 784.  The trial judge noted  that Forward did\n\nrequest that  certain  songs be  played  but \"the  band  then\n\nplayed  those songs  in  precisely the  same  manner that  it\n\nalways played them.\"   Id.  The district court's  concise and\n                         \n\nunqualified findings are fully supported by the evidence\n\n     Forward  has only one legal prop  for his contrary claim\n\nand it is a weak one.   In the House Report on the  Copyright\n\n                             -8-\n\nAct of 1976,  the committee  observed that  the copyright  in\n\nsound  recordings \"will usually,  though not  always, involve\n\n`authorship' both  . . .  [by the  artist and by]  the record\n\nproducer  responsible for  setting up the  recording session,\n\ncapturing  and  electronically  processing  the  sounds,  and\n\ncompiling  and   editing  them   to  make  the   final  sound\n\nrecording.\"  H.  Rep. No.  94-1476, 94th Cong.,  2d Sess.  56\n\n(1976).  It is apparent from this passage that the \"producer\"\n\nenvisaged by the committee is one who engages in artistically\n\nsupervising  and editing  the  production.   See generally  1\n                                                          \n\nNimmer   2.10[A](2)(b), at  2-150 to 2-151.  That  is exactly\n      \n\nwhat Forward did not do in this case.  \n\n     The Band has sought an award of attorney's fees expended\n\nin this  court, arguing  that Forward's appeal  is frivolous.\n\nWe think that  the appeal comes  very close to  the line  but\n\ndoes not quite step over it and therefore deny the motion.\n\n     Affirmed.  \n             \n\n                             -9-\n</pre>",
