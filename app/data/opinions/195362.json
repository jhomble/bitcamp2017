Hunger, Assistant  Attorney General,  Richard M.  Evans,\n                                                                 \nAssistant  Director,  and Ellen  Sue  Shapiro,  Office of  Immigration\n                                         \nLitigation,  Civil Division, U.S. Department  of Justice, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per Curiam.   We have  reviewed the  record and  we\n                    \n\nconclude  that  the  Board  did not  abuse  its  considerable\n\ndiscretion  in determining  that  petitioner did  not warrant\n\ndiscretionary relief from deportation.\n\n          1.  Petitioner faults  the Board for not mentioning\n\nvarious pieces of evidence, but the Board was not required to\n\ndo so.   The  immigration judge  dictated a lengthy  opinion,\n\ncontaining   extensive  factual   findings  and   a  reasoned\n\nexplanation  for the  denial  of discretionary  relief.   The\n\nBoard, in a short  order, agreed with the  immigration judge,\n\naffirmed his decision, and briefly summarized the reasons for\n\ndenying  discretionary relief.    This was  sufficient.   The\n\nBoard is not required  to restate every piece of  evidence or\n\ndetail of reasoning.  See Martinez  v. INS, 970 F.2d 973, 976\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (Board  not required to \"address specifically\n\neach  claim the petitioner made on each piece of evidence the\n\npetitioner presented\").\n\n          2.     Neither  the  Board  nor  immigration  judge\n\nimproperly  applied  precedent  or abused  its  discretion in\n\nconcluding that petitioner was not sufficiently rehabilitated\n\nand in considering the lack of rehabilitation in its decision\n\nto deny discretionary relief.  Gonzalez v. INS, 996 F.2d 804,\n                                              \n\n811-12  (6th Cir. 1993); Akrap  v. INS, 966  F.2d 267, 272-73\n                                      \n\n(7th Cir. 1992).\n\n          3.  We  will not  consider petitioner's  challenge,\n\nraised for  the first time in his reply brief, to the Board's\n\nallegedly unwritten policy of denying discretionary relief to\n\nany drug  offender.   There  is nothing  on the  face of  the\n\nimmigration   judge's   lengthy   opinion  (which   carefully\n\nconsidered   and  weighed   the  favorable   and  unfavorable\n\ncircumstances  pertaining to  petitioner) or  in the  Board's\n\ndecision  indicating  that such  an unwritten  policy exists;\n\npetitioner's drug involvement was  not minor or isolated; and\n\nlitigants  may not raise issues for the first time in a reply\n\nbrief.
