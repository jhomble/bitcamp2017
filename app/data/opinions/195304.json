Jerry Howard (\"Howard\"),  record owner of\n                    \n\nthe  property  at  issue  in  this  case,  appeals  a  decree  of\n\nforfeiture entered by the district court below.\n\n          On February 2, 1992, the United States Government filed\n\na  Complaint for  forfeiture  pursuant to  21 U.S.C.    881(a)(7)\n\nagainst real  property located at 330 Fern Street, Bangor, Maine.\n\nThe matter arises from the  execution of a search warrant  by law\n\nenforcement  agents  who  found   70  growing  marijuana  plants,\n\nassorted   drying  marijuana,   marijuana   seeds,  and   various\n\nparaphernalia related  to the growing of marijuana  plants in the\n\nbasement of the  property in question.   Thereafter the occupants\n\nof 330  Fern Street,  John and Susan  Burke, were  indicted by  a\n\nfederal  grand jury in Bangor,  Maine on charges of manufacturing\n\nmarijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1).1\n\n          Howard appeals  from the  decree of  forfeiture whereby\n\nthe court entered  a default judgment  after trial was  continued\n\nthree  times at Howard's request, and Howard had failed to answer\n\ninterrogatories,  to appear  for  a pretrial  conference or  jury\n\nselection, or to  respond to the court's order to  show cause why\n\ndefault judgment should not  be entered, and after the  court had\n\ndenied the  Government's first motion  for entry  of default,  in\n\norder to  afford Howard  \"one final  opportunity to present  what\n\nappeared to be a reasonable 'innocent landowner' defense.\"\n\n                    \n\n1    John Burke  later  pled  guilty  in  federal court  and  was\nsentenced  to  a  30  month  term of  imprisonment,  three  years\nsupervised release,  and a $10,000  criminal fine.   His sentence\nwas affirmed on appeal.  See United States v. Burke, 999 F.2d 596\n                                                   \n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                               -2-\n                                2\n\n          The district court entered  final judgment in this case\n\nafter Howard's  attorney represented  to Magistrate  Judge Eugene\n\nBeaulieu  that  he had  no reason  to  believe that  Howard would\n\nappear if ordered once  again to do so, and  after the Magistrate\n\nJudge issued a recommended  decision that the Government's second\n\nmotion  for entry of default be granted.  Thereafter Howard filed\n\na  Rule 60(b)  motion seeking  relief  from  the judgment,  which\n\nmotion  was  denied and  from which  denial  Howard appeals.   We\n\naffirm the district court's ruling.\n\n          Motions to set aside default judgments pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Civ.
