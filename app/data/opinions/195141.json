Dr. Syed M. Zafar\n                                         \n\nfiled  suit  in  1990 alleging  that  Roger  Williams General\n\nHospital (\"the Hospital\") had broken its contract with him by\n\nfailing  to  provide  him with  a  medical  residency program\n\napproved  by the  Accreditation Council for  Graduate Medical\n\nEducation  (\"ACGME\"), by failing  to certify to  the American\n\nMedical   Association  (\"AMA\")   that  he   had  successfully\n\ncompleted  a one-year  internship in  such a program,  and by\n\nfailing to provide certain procedural rights due to him under\n\nthe contract.    After  a  bench  trial,  the  United  States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Rhode Island found for the\n\ndefendant Hospital.  Dr. Zafar appeals, and we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n          In  July 1983, the  Hospital and Dr.  Zafar entered\n\ninto a written agreement whereby Dr. Zafar agreed to serve as\n\na \"rotating intern\" for one  year, at the first  postgraduate\n\nyear level.  Zafar agreed, inter alia, \"to develop a personal\n                                     \n\nprogram  of   self  study  and   professional  growth,\"   \"to\n\nparticipate  in  safe,  effective and  compassionate  patient\n\ncare,\" and \"to adhere  to established practices,  procedures,\n\nand policies of the Hospital . . . .\"\n\n          In  return,  the  Hospital agreed  to  provide:  \"a\n\nsuitable  environment for  medical  education experience\";  a\n\ntraining program accredited  by the ACGME; and  \"a mechanism,\n\nwith  appropriate  due  process safeguards,  whereby  actions\n\n                             -2-\n\nwhich  impact  upon  the   Resident's  status  and/or  career\n\ndevelopment may be addressed.\"\n\n          The agreement  stated  that the  parties  could  be\n\nreleased  from  their  \"ethical  and  legal  obligations\"  to\n\nfulfill  their responsibilities under the agreement if either\n\nof   two  conditions  occurred:    first,  if  the  \"Resident\n\nPhysician\"  for  reason  of  illness  or  \"other  good  cause\n\nacceptable  to the Hospital\"  could not continue;  second, if\n\n\"in the judgement of  those responsible for the  Program, the\n\nResident Physician,  following timely notice  and opportunity\n\nto  be heard,  has failed  to perform  and discharge  his/her\n\nresponsibilities in acceptable manner . . . .\"  In the latter\n\ncase,  the agreement would terminate \"only after recourse, if\n\nso  desired by  the  Resident Physician,  to the  Due Process\n\nmechanism\" earlier referred to in the agreement.\n\n          Although  this  agreement was  modeled on  the form\n\ncontract  used for other resident physicians at the Hospital,\n\nthe agreement with  Dr. Zafar  was altered  in several  ways.\n\nFor example,  Dr. Zafar was  not to receive any  salary, life\n\ninsurance,  disability  insurance,  or vacation.    Dr. Zafar\n\nagreed to  such limitations  apparently because  he had  been\n\nlate in applying for internship positions, and had gained the\n\nposition  at the  Hospital  only after  a  friend, Dr.  Naeem\n\nSaddiqui, helped him gain an entr e by introducing him to Dr.\n\nWilliam Klutz, the  chairman of the Hospital's  Department of\n\n                             -3-\n\nSurgery at the  time.  Dr. Zafar's situation  was unique also\n\nin that he  expected to be at the Hospital for only one year,\n\ninstead of the usual three year period for most residents.\n\n          Soon after executing the agreement, Dr. Zafar began\n\nhis  internship  at the  Hospital.    He  was placed  in  the\n\ninternal medicine  program, which  at the  time was the  only\n\nACGME-approved residency program  at the Hospital.   He began\n\nmaking  rounds with  the  other  residents  in  the  internal\n\nmedicine program.\n\n          Shortly after Dr. Zafar began performing  duties as\n\na medical  intern, his  supervisor, a  Dr. Burtt,  learned of\n\nseveral  highly  critical evaluations  of  Dr. Zafar's  work.\n\nAfter  some  investigation,  Dr.  Burtt  recommended  to  the\n\nassistant director of the residency program that Dr. Zafar be\n\ntaken off  of medical service.   Dr. Burtt  also went to  Dr.\n\nKlutz, as he had been responsible for bringing Dr. Zafar into\n\nthe  program.   Dr.  Burtt  explained to  Dr.  Klutz that  he\n\nbelieved Dr. Zafar was not competent to serve in the internal\n\nmedicine  program and that the Hospital would have difficulty\n\ngraduating him from the program.  He suggested that Dr. Zafar\n\nbe rotated to the department  of surgery for the remainder of\n\nthe year.\n\n          According to Dr. Klutz's contemporaneous notes,  he\n\nmet with Dr. Zafar  on October 7, 1983.   Dr. Klutz  informed\n\nDr. Zafar that  he had received an  unsatisfactory evaluation\n\n                             -4-\n\nand stated that Dr. Zafar had the option of either seeking an\n\nappointment to another hospital or moving into the department\n\nof  surgery.   According to  Dr.  Klutz, Dr.  Zafar chose  to\n\ntransfer  to surgery  within  a  few days  of  the October  7\n\nmeeting.\n\n          At trial, Dr.  Zafar testified that he did not meet\n\nwith Dr.  Klutz in  October, 1983, and  that Dr.  Klutz never\n\ntold  him of any  poor performance evaluations  nor discussed\n\nwith him the possibility of  leaving the Hospital.  Dr. Zafar\n\ntestified  that  Dr.  Klutz  did  inform  him  he  was  being\n\ntransferred to the department of  surgery, but had offered no\n\nexplanation for the  transfer.    Moreover, according to  Dr.\n\nZafar, Dr. Klutz did not  notify him of his imminent transfer\n\nuntil late November, 1983.    Dr. Zafar  also testified  that\n\nin late November he received a copy of a memo from a Dr. Vito\n\nin the  department  of surgery  that  was addressed  to  head\n\nnurses and operating room personnel.  The memo explained that\n\nDr. Zafar would begin \"covering\" the surgical patients of Dr.\n\nVito and three other physicians, and would be responsible for\n\nmaking  daily rounds on those patients and \"entering progress\n\nnotes and writing  orders as necessary.\"  Dr.  Zafar was also\n\nto  be  \"available  to answer  questions  concerning  patient\n\nmanagement.\"\n\n          Dr.  Zafar  admitted  to  having  known   that  the\n\nHospital  did not have an ACGME-approved residency program in\n\n                             -5-\n\nsurgery.  Nevertheless,  Dr. Zafar never inquired  whether he\n\nwould receive credit nor did he invoke the due process rights\n\nmentioned  in the  contract.   He  finished the  year in  the\n\ndepartment of surgery and thereafter left the hospital. \n\n          Subsequent  to his  departure, Dr. Zafar  began the\n\nprocess of applying for medical  licensure in New Jersey.  In\n\nJuly of  1984, the  Hospital sent to  the New  Jersey medical\n\nlicensing  authority a certificate stating that Dr. Zafar had\n\nsuccessfully completed a one-year \"mixed internship\" approved\n\nby the AMA.  Sometime during 1989, however, Dr. Zafar learned\n\nthat  AMA records  did not  show him  as having  completed an\n\napproved  program at the Hospital.  After some correspondence\n\nwith the Hospital, Dr. Zafar filed suit in 1990 alleging that\n\nthe Hospital had breached the July 1983 agreement  by failing\n\nto certify to  the AMA that he had  successfully completed an\n\napproved medical internship.\n\n          The case was tried  without a jury in February  and\n\nMarch, 1993.  After the plaintiff's  case, the district court\n\nfound  that  Dr.   Zafar  did  not  complete   an  accredited\n\ninternship  and  was  therefore  not  entitled  to  have  the\n\nHospital certify that he did.   The district court found that\n\nthe  Hospital's   own  representations  in  the   New  Jersey\n\ncertificate  had been in error and  that it was \"unfortunate\"\n\nthat the certificate had been sent.\n\n                             -6-\n\n          The district court went on to hear more evidence on\n\nthe issue  of whether  Dr. Zafar was  denied the  due process\n\nrights guaranteed him under the contract.  After hearing  all\n\nthe evidence,  the district  court found  that Dr.  Zafar had\n\nreceived  actual notice of his poor  performance, that he had\n\nthe  opportunity  to pursue  the  matter and  to  contest the\n\nallegations if he had so  chosen, and that he had  chosen not\n\nto do  so.   The court  concluded that  the Hospital  had not\n\nviolated any terms of the contract with Dr. Zafar.\n\n          We affirm.\n\n                             II.\n\n          On appeal, Dr.  Zafar no longer  argues that he  is\n\nentitled to  have the Hospital  certify that he  completed an\n\nACGME-approved internship.  He argues that the Hospital broke\n\nits agreement  with him by  failing in the first  instance to\n\nprovide  an  approved  program, or,  in  the  alternative, by\n\nfailing to  afford due process before transferring him out of\n\nthe  internal medicine residency, which was the sole approved\n\nprogram.\n\n          Dr. Zafar's first argument, that the Hospital broke\n\nthe agreement  by failing  to provide  an approved  residency\n\nprogram, is undercut  by Dr. Zafar's concession  that when he\n\nbegan his  internship at the  Hospital he was in  an approved\n     \n\nprogram.  He  seeks to counteract this by  asserting that the\n\nHospital  had enrolled  him in  a  unique one-year  \"rotating\n\n                             -7-\n\ninternship\"  that began  in an  approved  program (i.e.,  the\n                                                       \n\ninternal medicine internship) but that required him to rotate\n\namong  various unaccredited  departments, including  surgery.\n\nHe  argues that  this  \"rotating  internship\"  would  not  be\n\naccredited,  and that the  Hospital, therefore, was  from the\n\nstart in  breach of  its agreement  to furnish an  accredited\n\nprogram.\n\n          Dr. Zafar's argument is essentially factual and was\n\nresolved against  him by the  district court.  We  cannot say\n\nthe court committed clear error in not finding that Dr. Zafar\n\nhad been enrolled  in some new, hybrid program  for which AMA\n\ncredit was unavailable even had he successfully completed it.\n\nTo be sure, both Dr. Klutz and Dr. Calabresi, the chairman of\n\nthe  Department of Medicine  at the Hospital  during 1983-84,\n\ntestified that they had expected Dr. Zafar to rotate to other\n\nspecialties during  his  time at  the  Hospital.   There  was\n\nsubstantial  evidence, however,  that  rotation was  possible\n\nwithin  the approved internal medicine program and could have\n\nbeen  accomplished while receiving full credit.  According to\n\nthe Policies and Procedures of the American Board of Internal\n\nMedicine,  which were admitted  as evidence at  trial, twelve\n\nmonths of credit  can be received for  the first postgraduate\n\nyear of training  if the resident spends at  least six months\n\nin   internal  medicine  and  an  additional  two  months  in\n\npediatrics,  dermatology,  neurology, and/or  emergency  room\n\n                             -8-\n\ncare.   The  remaining four  months can  be spent  in another\n\nspecialty, such as  surgery.  This, apparently,  explains the\n\nuse of  the term \"rotating  intern\"    in fact,  according to\n\nthe Policies and  Procedures, the first year  of postgraduate\n\ntraining  in  internal   medicine  was  called   a  \"rotating\n\ninternship.\"   Both Dr. Calabresi  and Dr. Klutz testified to\n\nan accredited \"rotating\" program of this type.\n\n          The  district  court  found   that  Dr.  Zafar  was\n\nswitched to the unaccredited program only when his supervisor\n\nin the approved internal medicine program determined that his\n\nwork was so  unsatisfactory that he should not  be allowed to\n\ncontinue  in it.   Dr.  Zafar  was thus  forced to  leave the\n\ncritical internal  medicine component  short of the  required\n\nsix months minimum necessary to receive credit, and without a\n\nsatisfactory record.  This was allowed by the contract, which\n\nexpressly authorized the Hospital to drop Dr.  Zafar from the\n\naccredited program  if he  \"failed to  perform and  discharge\n\nhis[] responsibilities  in an acceptable  manner\"    assuming\n\nproper  notice and opportunity  to be heard,  and recourse to\n\nthe  due  process mechanism  if  so  requested, infra.    The\n                                                     \n\ndistrict  court was justified in finding, therefore, that the\n\nHospital was not in breach of its contract from the start for\n\nfailure ever to have offered an accredited program.\n\n          Dr.  Zafar's second argument  is that  the Hospital\n\nviolated the  agreement by  denying him  his contractual  due\n\n                             -9-\n\nprocess  rights at  the time  he was  transferred out  of the\n\napproved  program.    He  argues that  the  Hospital  had  no\n\n\"mechanism,\"  as required by the contract, to redress actions\n\nthat would  affect the residents'  careers.  Also,  Dr. Zafar\n\nsuggests  that the Hospital broke the  contract by failing to\n\nprovide  him with adequate  notice of his  subpar performance\n\nand  of the  fact that the  shift to surgery  would result in\n\ncritical alterations in his intended career development.\n\n          The  district  court  considered  these points  and\n\nrejected them.  The court found  as a fact that a  \"mechanism\n\nwas  in place\"  for Dr.  Zafar  to exercise  his due  process\n\nrights.   This mechanism was outlined in  a document entitled\n\n\"Due  Process  For  Resident Physicians,\"  which  Dr. Zafar's\n\ncounsel  introduced  at  trial  and  quoted  in  his  closing\n\nargument.  This document specifically refers to the provision\n\nin the  generic contract  used for  resident physicians  (and\n\nused  in  modified   form  for  Dr.  Zafar)   containing  the\n\nrequirement for providing a mechanism for due process.  We do\n\nnot  think it  was  clear  error for  the  district court  to\n\nconclude that such a mechanism existed.\n\n          The  Hospital  was  not  required,  however,  as  a\n\ncondition to dropping Dr. Zafar from the approved program, to\n\nautomatically engage  the elaborate  due process  protections\n\nspelled out in \"Due Process For Resident Physicians.\"  By the\n\nterms  of the agreement, the due process \"mechanism\" required\n\n                             -10-\n\nby the agreement  to \"address\" actions taken by  the Hospital\n\nwould  came  into  play  only if  \"desired  by  the  Resident\n\nPhysician.\"   Dr. Zafar  never announced such  a desire.   He\n\nadmitted  at trial  that he  knew he  had due  process rights\n\navailable to him under the contract but that he never invoked\n\nthose rights.\n\n          Since  Dr.  Zafar  never invoked  the  due  process\n\nmechanism  mentioned in the contract, his argument is limited\n\nto the contention that he  did not receive the \"timely notice\n\nand opportunity  to be  heard\" that under  the contract  must\n\nprecede  a determination by those responsible for the program\n\nthat  he failed  to perform acceptably.   The  district court\n\nheard extensive  testimony on this  point and found  that the\n\nHospital had satisfied its duties under this clause. \n\n          This might have  been a close  issue on the  facts.\n\nNone of the  doctors at the Hospital, including  Dr. Klutz or\n\nDr.  Calabresi, testified to having told Dr. Zafar explicitly\n                                                             \n\nthat upon his early transfer  to surgery he would not receive\n\ncredit for completing  an ACGME-certified internship.   To be\n\nsure, Dr.  Zafar admitted that  he knew the Hospital  did not\n\nhave  an accredited  residency  program  in  surgery.    This\n\nadmission  was  perhaps  not damning  to  his  case, however,\n\nbecause there was evidence, supra, that Dr. Zafar  might have\n                                 \n\nrotated to surgery  at some later point within the accredited\n\n\"rotating  internship\" for  which  he originally  contracted.\n\n                             -11-\n\nArguably,  Dr. Zafar misunderstood the import of his enforced\n\ntransfer to surgery and underestimated the seriousness of his\n\nsituation.  \n\n          Nonetheless, the  contract did not  require written\n\nnotice,  and the  district  court found  that  Dr. Zafar  had\n\norally received  \"actual notice\"  of his  predicament at  the\n\nOctober 7,  1983, meeting with Dr.  Klutz.  As  a result, the\n\ncourt  found  that  Dr.  Zafar  was  properly  \"charged  with\n\nknowledge\" of his situation, and that  \"he had an opportunity\n\nfor discussion and  for hearing to contest  those allegations\n\nif  he  wanted to  pursue that  matter, and  he chose  not to\n\npursue   that  avenue.\"    These  findings  are  sufficiently\n\nsupported by the evidence.  Dr. Zafar admitted that there had\n\nbeen questions about his performance, and Dr. Klutz testified\n\nthat   he   told   Dr.  Zafar   his   evaluations   had  been\n\nunsatisfactory and that he believed  that Dr. Zafar knew  the\n\nseriousness of his situation.   Dr. Zafar also stopped  doing\n\nrounds with the  residents in the approved  medicine program.\n\nMoreover, Dr. Zafar  received the memo from Dr.  Vito that he\n\nwould be transferring to surgery,  when he had expected to be\n\nin internal  medicine for at  least six months and  knew that\n\nsurgery was not accredited.\n\n          It  is  significant  that  Dr.  Zafar's   testimony\n\ndirectly contradicted that of Dr. Klutz, leaving the court   \n\nupon  believing Dr. Klutz    with understandable doubts about\n\n                             -12-\n\nDr.  Zafar's credibility  generally.    The district  court's\n\nfindings rested, in  significant part,  on determinations  of\n\nthe credibility  of the witnesses, for which  we are required\n\nto give \"due regard.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).   In discussing\n\nthe crucial October 7 meeting between Dr. Zafar and Dr. Klutz\n\n(which Dr.  Zafar essentially  denied ever  took place),  the\n\ndistrict  court stated: \"Doctor  Klutz has his  notes of that\n\nmeeting and  I believe his  testimony as to what  occurred at\n\nthat meeting.\"  The court said that it was\n\n          satisfied  that  Doctor Klutz's  testimony  is\n          accurate  and at  that meeting  on October  7,\n          1983, Doctor  Klutz told the  plaintiff of his\n          unsatisfactory  evaluation in  the same  terms\n          that Doctor Burtt had related to Doctor Klutz,\n          and that  he told him  of the options     that\n          the  plaintiff, at that  point, was not  to be\n          kept  in the accredited program and he had two\n          choices.

Zafar filed suit in 1990 alleging that Roger Williams General Hospital (\"the Hospital\") had broken its contract with him by failing to provide him with a medical residency program approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (\"ACGME\"), by failing to certify to the American Medical Association (\"AMA\") that he had successfully completed a one-year internship in such a program, and by failing to provide certain procedural rights due to him under the contract.  After a bench trial, the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island found for the defendant Hospital.  Dr. Zafar appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1983, the Hospital and Dr. Zafar entered into a written agreement whereby Dr. Zafar agreed to serve as a \"rotating intern\" for one year, at the first postgraduate year level.  Zafar agreed, inter alia, \"to develop a personal program of self study and professional growth,\" \"to participate in safe, effective and compassionate patient care,\" and \"to adhere to established practices, procedures, and policies of the Hospital....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In return, the Hospital agreed to provide:  \"a suitable environment for medical education experience\";  a training program accredited by the ACGME;  and \"a mechanism, with appropriate due process safeguards, whereby actions which impact upon the Resident's status and/or career development may be addressed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement stated that the parties could be released from their \"ethical and legal obligations\" to fulfill their responsibilities under the agreement if either of two conditions occurred:  first, if the \"Resident Physician\" for reason of illness or \"other good cause acceptable to the Hospital\" could not continue;  second, if \"in the judgement of those responsible for the Program, the Resident Physician, following timely notice and opportunity to be heard, has failed to perform and discharge his/her responsibilities in acceptable manner....\"  In the latter case, the agreement would terminate \"only after recourse, if so desired by the Resident Physician, to the Due Process mechanism\" earlier referred to in the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this agreement was modeled on the form contract used for other resident physicians at the Hospital, the agreement with Dr. Zafar was altered in several ways.  For example, Dr. Zafar was not to receive any salary, life insurance, disability insurance, or vacation.  Dr. Zafar agreed to such limitations apparently because he had been late in applying for internship positions, and had gained the position at the Hospital only after a friend, Dr. Naeem Saddiqui, helped him gain an entree by introducing him to Dr. William Klutz, the chairman of the Hospital's Department of</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Surgery at the time.  Dr. Zafar's situation was unique also in that he expected to be at the Hospital for only one year, instead of the usual three year period for most residents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after executing the agreement, Dr. Zafar began his internship at the Hospital.  He was placed in the internal medicine program, which at the time was the only ACGME-approved residency program at the Hospital.  He began making rounds with the other residents in the internal medicine program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after Dr. Zafar began performing duties as a medical intern, his supervisor, a Dr. Burtt, learned of several highly critical evaluations of Dr. Zafar's work.  After some investigation, Dr. Burtt recommended to the assistant director of the residency program that Dr. Zafar be taken off of medical service.  Dr. Burtt also went to Dr. Klutz, as he had been responsible for bringing Dr. Zafar into the program.  Dr. Burtt explained to Dr. Klutz that he believed Dr. Zafar was not competent to serve in the internal medicine program and that the Hospital would have difficulty graduating him from the program.  He suggested that Dr. Zafar be rotated to the department of surgery for the remainder of the year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Dr. Klutz's contemporaneous notes, he met with Dr. Zafar on October 7, 1983.  Dr. Klutz informed Dr. Zafar that he had received an unsatisfactory evaluation and stated that Dr. Zafar had the option of either seeking an appointment to another hospital or moving into the department of surgery.  According to Dr. Klutz, Dr. Zafar chose to transfer to surgery within a few days of the October 7 meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Dr. Zafar testified that he did not meet with Dr. Klutz in October, 1983, and that Dr. Klutz never told him of any poor performance evaluations nor discussed with him the possibility of leaving the Hospital.  Dr. Zafar testified that Dr. Klutz did inform him he was being transferred to the department of surgery, but had offered no explanation for the transfer.  Moreover, according to Dr. Zafar, Dr. Klutz did not notify him of his imminent transfer until late November, 1983.  Dr. Zafar also testified that in late November he received a copy of a memo from a Dr. Vito in the department of surgery that was addressed to head nurses and operating room personnel.  The memo explained that Dr. Zafar would begin \"covering\" the surgical patients of Dr. Vito and three other physicians, and would be responsible for making daily rounds on those patients and \"entering progress notes and writing orders as necessary.\"  Dr. Zafar was also to be \"available to answer questions concerning patient management.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Zafar admitted to having known that the Hospital did not have an ACGME-approved residency program in surgery.  Nevertheless, Dr. Zafar never inquired whether he would receive credit nor did he invoke the due process rights mentioned in the contract.  He finished the year in the department of surgery and thereafter left the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent to his departure, Dr. Zafar began the process of applying for medical licensure in New Jersey.  In July of 1984, the Hospital sent to the New Jersey medical licensing authority a certificate stating that Dr. Zafar had successfully completed a one-year \"mixed internship\" approved by the AMA.  Sometime during 1989, however, Dr. Zafar learned that AMA records did not show him as having completed an approved program at the Hospital.  After some correspondence with the Hospital, Dr. Zafar filed suit in 1990 alleging that the Hospital had breached the July 1983 agreement by failing to certify to the AMA that he had successfully completed an approved medical internship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried without a jury in February and March, 1993.  After the plaintiff's case, the district court found that Dr. Zafar did not complete an accredited internship and was therefore not entitled to have the Hospital certify that he did.  The district court found that the Hospital's own representations in the New Jersey certificate had been in error and that it was \"unfortunate\" that the certificate had been sent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court went on to hear more evidence on the issue of whether Dr. Zafar was denied the due process rights guaranteed him under the contract.  After hearing all the evidence, the district court found that Dr. Zafar had received actual notice of his poor performance, that he had the opportunity to pursue the matter and to contest the allegations if he had so chosen, and that he had chosen not to do so.  The court concluded that the Hospital had not violated any terms of the contract with Dr. Zafar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Dr. Zafar no longer argues that he is entitled to have the Hospital certify that he completed an ACGME-approved internship.  He argues that the Hospital broke its agreement with him by failing in the first instance to provide an approved program, or, in the alternative, by failing to afford due process before transferring him out of the internal medicine residency, which was the sole approved program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Zafar's first argument, that the Hospital broke the agreement by failing to provide an approved residency program, is undercut by Dr. Zafar's concession that when he began his internship at the Hospital he was in an approved program.  He seeks to counteract this by asserting that the Hospital had enrolled him in a unique one-year \"rotating internship\" that began in an approved program (i.e., the internal medicine internship) but that required him to rotate among various unaccredited departments, including surgery.  He argues that this \"rotating internship\" would not be accredited, and that the Hospital, therefore, was from the start in breach of its agreement to furnish an accredited program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Zafar's argument is essentially factual and was resolved against him by the district court.  We cannot say the court committed clear error in not finding that Dr. Zafar had been enrolled in some new, hybrid program for which AMA credit was unavailable even had he successfully completed it.  To be sure, both Dr. Klutz and Dr. Calabresi, the chairman of the Department of Medicine at the Hospital during 1983-84, testified that they had expected Dr. Zafar to rotate to other specialties during his time at the Hospital.  There was substantial evidence, however, that rotation was possible within the approved internal medicine program and could have been accomplished while receiving full credit.  According to the Policies and Procedures of the American Board of Internal Medicine, which were admitted as evidence at trial, twelve months of credit can be received for the first postgraduate year of training if the resident spends at least six months in internal medicine and an additional two months in pediatrics, dermatology, neurology, and/or emergency room care.  The remaining four months can be spent in another specialty, such as surgery.  This, apparently, explains the use of the term \"rotating intern\"-in fact, according to the Policies and Procedures, the first year of postgraduate training in internal medicine was called a \"rotating internship.\"  Both Dr. Calabresi and Dr. Klutz testified to an accredited \"rotating\" program of this type.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Dr. Zafar was switched to the unaccredited program only when his supervisor in the approved internal medicine program determined that his work was so unsatisfactory that he should not be allowed to continue in it.  Dr. Zafar was thus forced to leave the critical internal medicine component short of the required six months minimum necessary to receive credit, and without a satisfactory record.  This was allowed by the contract, which expressly authorized the Hospital to drop Dr. Zafar from the accredited program if he \"failed to perform and discharge his[ ] responsibilities in an acceptable manner\"-assuming proper notice and opportunity to be heard, and recourse to the due process mechanism if so requested, infra.  The district court was justified in finding, therefore, that the Hospital was not in breach of its contract from the start for failure ever to have offered an accredited program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Zafar's second argument is that the Hospital violated the agreement by denying him his contractual due process rights at the time he was transferred out of the approved program.  He argues that the Hospital had no \"mechanism,\" as required by the contract, to redress actions that would affect the residents' careers.  Also, Dr. Zafar suggests that the Hospital broke the contract by failing to provide him with adequate notice of his subpar performance and of the fact that the shift to surgery would result in critical alterations in his intended career development.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court considered these points and rejected them.  The court found as a fact that a \"mechanism was in place\" for Dr. Zafar to exercise his due process rights.  This mechanism was outlined in a document entitled \"Due Process For Resident Physicians,\" which Dr. Zafar's counsel introduced at trial and quoted in his closing argument.  This document specifically refers to the provision in the generic contract used for resident physicians (and used in modified form for Dr. Zafar) containing the requirement for providing a mechanism for due process.  We do not think it was clear error for the district court to conclude that such a mechanism existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital was not required, however, as a condition to dropping Dr. Zafar from the approved program, to automatically engage the elaborate due process protections spelled out in \"Due Process For Resident Physicians.\"  By the terms of the agreement, the due process \"mechanism\" required by the agreement to \"address\" actions taken by the Hospital would came into play only if \"desired by the Resident Physician.\"  Dr. Zafar never announced such a desire.  He admitted at trial that he knew he had due process rights available to him under the contract but that he never invoked those rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Dr. Zafar never invoked the due process mechanism mentioned in the contract, his argument is limited to the contention that he did not receive the \"timely notice and opportunity to be heard\" that under the contract must precede a determination by those responsible for the program that he failed to perform acceptably.  The district court heard extensive testimony on this point and found that the Hospital had satisfied its duties under this clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This might have been a close issue on the facts.  None of the doctors at the Hospital, including Dr. Klutz or Dr. Calabresi, testified to having told Dr. Zafar explicitly that upon his early transfer to surgery he would not receive credit for completing an ACGME-certified internship.  To be sure, Dr. Zafar admitted that he knew the Hospital did not have an accredited residency program in surgery.  This admission was perhaps not damning to his case, however, because there was evidence, supra, that Dr. Zafar might have rotated to surgery at some later point within the accredited \"rotating internship\" for which he originally contracted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguably, Dr. Zafar misunderstood the import of his enforced transfer to surgery and underestimated the seriousness of his situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the contract did not require written notice, and the district court found that Dr. Zafar had orally received \"actual notice\" of his predicament at the October 7, 1983, meeting with Dr. Klutz.  As a result, the court found that Dr. Zafar was properly \"charged with knowledge\" of his situation, and that \"he had an opportunity for discussion and for hearing to contest those allegations if he wanted to pursue that matter, and he chose not to pursue that avenue.\"  These findings are sufficiently supported by the evidence.  Dr. Zafar admitted that there had been questions about his performance, and Dr. Klutz testified that he told Dr. Zafar his evaluations had been unsatisfactory and that he believed that Dr. Zafar knew the seriousness of his situation.  Dr. Zafar also stopped doing rounds with the residents in the approved medicine program.  Moreover, Dr. Zafar received the memo from Dr. Vito that he would be transferring to surgery, when he had expected to be in internal medicine for at least six months and knew that surgery was not accredited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is significant that Dr. Zafar's testimony directly contradicted that of Dr. Klutz, leaving the court-upon believing Dr. Klutz-with understandable doubts about</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Zafar's credibility generally.  The district court's findings rested, in significant part, on determinations of the credibility of the witnesses, for which we are required to give \"due regard.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).  In discussing the crucial October 7 meeting between Dr. Zafar and Dr. Klutz (which Dr. Zafar essentially denied ever took place), the district court stated:  \"Doctor Klutz has his notes of that meeting and I believe his testimony as to what occurred at that meeting.\"  The court said that it was</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>satisfied that Doctor Klutz's testimony is accurate and at that meeting on October 7, 1983, Doctor Klutz told the plaintiff of his unsatisfactory evaluation in the same terms that Doctor Burtt had related to Doctor Klutz, and that he told him of the options-that the plaintiff, at that point, was not to be kept in the accredited program and he had two choices.  He could seek an appointment to another Hospital or he could go on to an internship in surgery which, by the plaintiff's own testimony, he knew was not an accredited program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also stated that it was convinced that \"Dr. Klutz told [Dr. Zafar] that he ought to talk to Doctor Burtt\" about his negative evaluations, but that Dr. Zafar never did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge contrasted the believability of Dr. Klutz with that of Dr. Zafar:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>It's obvious what the plaintiff was doing here during his testimony at the beginning of this case.  He was trying to convince the Court that he was blissfully ignorant of what was going on around him at the time;  that he didn't realize that those in the internal medicine program were dissatisfied with his performance to the point of expelling him from that program....  The attempt of the plaintiff to portray this ignorance ... is disingenuous, and that's as polite as I can make it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these credibility determinations and factual findings, the district court concluded that Dr. Zafar had received actual notice and had received an opportunity for discussion of his performance.  This resolution of the evidence is not clearly erroneous.   See Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Zafar also argues cursorily that he was denied constitutional due process rights.

Zafar agreed, inter alia, \"to develop a personal program of self study and professional growth,\" \"to participate in safe, effective and compassionate patient care,\" and \"to adhere to established practices, procedures, and policies of the Hospital....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In return, the Hospital agreed to provide:  \"a suitable environment for medical education experience\";  a training program accredited by the ACGME;  and \"a mechanism, with appropriate due process safeguards, whereby actions which impact upon the Resident's status and/or career development may be addressed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement stated that the parties could be released from their \"ethical and legal obligations\" to fulfill their responsibilities under the agreement if either of two conditions occurred:  first, if the \"Resident Physician\" for reason of illness or \"other good cause acceptable to the Hospital\" could not continue;  second, if \"in the judgement of those responsible for the Program, the Resident Physician, following timely notice and opportunity to be heard, has failed to perform and discharge his/her responsibilities in acceptable manner....\"  In the latter case, the agreement would terminate \"only after recourse, if so desired by the Resident Physician, to the Due Process mechanism\" earlier referred to in the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this agreement was modeled on the form contract used for other resident physicians at the Hospital, the agreement with Dr. Zafar was altered in several ways.  For example, Dr. Zafar was not to receive any salary, life insurance, disability insurance, or vacation.  Dr. Zafar agreed to such limitations apparently because he had been late in applying for internship positions, and had gained the position at the Hospital only after a friend, Dr. Naeem Saddiqui, helped him gain an entree by introducing him to Dr. William Klutz, the chairman of the Hospital's Department of</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Surgery at the time.  Dr. Zafar's situation was unique also in that he expected to be at the Hospital for only one year, instead of the usual three year period for most residents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after executing the agreement, Dr. Zafar began his internship at the Hospital.  He was placed in the internal medicine program, which at the time was the only ACGME-approved residency program at the Hospital.  He began making rounds with the other residents in the internal medicine program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after Dr. Zafar began performing duties as a medical intern, his supervisor, a Dr. Burtt, learned of several highly critical evaluations of Dr. Zafar's work.  After some investigation, Dr. Burtt recommended to the assistant director of the residency program that Dr. Zafar be taken off of medical service.  Dr. Burtt also went to Dr. Klutz, as he had been responsible for bringing Dr. Zafar into the program.  Dr. Burtt explained to Dr. Klutz that he believed Dr. Zafar was not competent to serve in the internal medicine program and that the Hospital would have difficulty graduating him from the program.  He suggested that Dr. Zafar be rotated to the department of surgery for the remainder of the year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Dr. Klutz's contemporaneous notes, he met with Dr. Zafar on October 7, 1983.  Dr. Klutz informed Dr. Zafar that he had received an unsatisfactory evaluation and stated that Dr. Zafar had the option of either seeking an appointment to another hospital or moving into the department of surgery.  According to Dr. Klutz, Dr. Zafar chose to transfer to surgery within a few days of the October 7 meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Dr. Zafar testified that he did not meet with Dr. Klutz in October, 1983, and that Dr. Klutz never told him of any poor performance evaluations nor discussed with him the possibility of leaving the Hospital.  Dr. Zafar testified that Dr. Klutz did inform him he was being transferred to the department of surgery, but had offered no explanation for the transfer.  Moreover, according to Dr. Zafar, Dr. Klutz did not notify him of his imminent transfer until late November, 1983.  Dr. Zafar also testified that in late November he received a copy of a memo from a Dr. Vito in the department of surgery that was addressed to head nurses and operating room personnel.  The memo explained that Dr. Zafar would begin \"covering\" the surgical patients of Dr. Vito and three other physicians, and would be responsible for making daily rounds on those patients and \"entering progress notes and writing orders as necessary.\"  Dr. Zafar was also to be \"available to answer questions concerning patient management.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Zafar admitted to having known that the Hospital did not have an ACGME-approved residency program in surgery.  Nevertheless, Dr. Zafar never inquired whether he would receive credit nor did he invoke the due process rights mentioned in the contract.  He finished the year in the department of surgery and thereafter left the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent to his departure, Dr. Zafar began the process of applying for medical licensure in New Jersey.  In July of 1984, the Hospital sent to the New Jersey medical licensing authority a certificate stating that Dr. Zafar had successfully completed a one-year \"mixed internship\" approved by the AMA.  Sometime during 1989, however, Dr. Zafar learned that AMA records did not show him as having completed an approved program at the Hospital.  After some correspondence with the Hospital, Dr. Zafar filed suit in 1990 alleging that the Hospital had breached the July 1983 agreement by failing to certify to the AMA that he had successfully completed an approved medical internship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried without a jury in February and March, 1993.  After the plaintiff's case, the district court found that Dr. Zafar did not complete an accredited internship and was therefore not entitled to have the Hospital certify that he did.  The district court found that the Hospital's own representations in the New Jersey certificate had been in error and that it was \"unfortunate\" that the certificate had been sent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court went on to hear more evidence on the issue of whether Dr. Zafar was denied the due process rights guaranteed him under the contract.  After hearing all the evidence, the district court found that Dr. Zafar had received actual notice of his poor performance, that he had the opportunity to pursue the matter and to contest the allegations if he had so chosen, and that he had chosen not to do so.  The court concluded that the Hospital had not violated any terms of the contract with Dr. Zafar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Dr. Zafar no longer argues that he is entitled to have the Hospital certify that he completed an ACGME-approved internship.  He argues that the Hospital broke its agreement with him by failing in the first instance to provide an approved program, or, in the alternative, by failing to afford due process before transferring him out of the internal medicine residency, which was the sole approved program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Zafar's first argument, that the Hospital broke the agreement by failing to provide an approved residency program, is undercut by Dr. Zafar's concession that when he began his internship at the Hospital he was in an approved program.  He seeks to counteract this by asserting that the Hospital had enrolled him in a unique one-year \"rotating internship\" that began in an approved program (i.e., the internal medicine internship) but that required him to rotate among various unaccredited departments, including surgery.  He argues that this \"rotating internship\" would not be accredited, and that the Hospital, therefore, was from the start in breach of its agreement to furnish an accredited program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Zafar's argument is essentially factual and was resolved against him by the district court.  We cannot say the court committed clear error in not finding that Dr. Zafar had been enrolled in some new, hybrid program for which AMA credit was unavailable even had he successfully completed it.  To be sure, both Dr. Klutz and Dr. Calabresi, the chairman of the Department of Medicine at the Hospital during 1983-84, testified that they had expected Dr. Zafar to rotate to other specialties during his time at the Hospital.  There was substantial evidence, however, that rotation was possible within the approved internal medicine program and could have been accomplished while receiving full credit.  According to the Policies and Procedures of the American Board of Internal Medicine, which were admitted as evidence at trial, twelve months of credit can be received for the first postgraduate year of training if the resident spends at least six months in internal medicine and an additional two months in pediatrics, dermatology, neurology, and/or emergency room care.  The remaining four months can be spent in another specialty, such as surgery.  This, apparently, explains the use of the term \"rotating intern\"-in fact, according to the Policies and Procedures, the first year of postgraduate training in internal medicine was called a \"rotating internship.\"  Both Dr. Calabresi and Dr. Klutz testified to an accredited \"rotating\" program of this type.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Dr. Zafar was switched to the unaccredited program only when his supervisor in the approved internal medicine program determined that his work was so unsatisfactory that he should not be allowed to continue in it.  Dr. Zafar was thus forced to leave the critical internal medicine component short of the required six months minimum necessary to receive credit, and without a satisfactory record.  This was allowed by the contract, which expressly authorized the Hospital to drop Dr. Zafar from the accredited program if he \"failed to perform and discharge his[ ] responsibilities in an acceptable manner\"-assuming proper notice and opportunity to be heard, and recourse to the due process mechanism if so requested, infra.  The district court was justified in finding, therefore, that the Hospital was not in breach of its contract from the start for failure ever to have offered an accredited program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Zafar's second argument is that the Hospital violated the agreement by denying him his contractual due process rights at the time he was transferred out of the approved program.  He argues that the Hospital had no \"mechanism,\" as required by the contract, to redress actions that would affect the residents' careers.  Also, Dr. Zafar suggests that the Hospital broke the contract by failing to provide him with adequate notice of his subpar performance and of the fact that the shift to surgery would result in critical alterations in his intended career development.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court considered these points and rejected them.  The court found as a fact that a \"mechanism was in place\" for Dr. Zafar to exercise his due process rights.  This mechanism was outlined in a document entitled \"Due Process For Resident Physicians,\" which Dr. Zafar's counsel introduced at trial and quoted in his closing argument.  This document specifically refers to the provision in the generic contract used for resident physicians (and used in modified form for Dr. Zafar) containing the requirement for providing a mechanism for due process.  We do not think it was clear error for the district court to conclude that such a mechanism existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital was not required, however, as a condition to dropping Dr. Zafar from the approved program, to automatically engage the elaborate due process protections spelled out in \"Due Process For Resident Physicians.\"  By the terms of the agreement, the due process \"mechanism\" required by the agreement to \"address\" actions taken by the Hospital would came into play only if \"desired by the Resident Physician.\"  Dr. Zafar never announced such a desire.  He admitted at trial that he knew he had due process rights available to him under the contract but that he never invoked those rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Dr. Zafar never invoked the due process mechanism mentioned in the contract, his argument is limited to the contention that he did not receive the \"timely notice and opportunity to be heard\" that under the contract must precede a determination by those responsible for the program that he failed to perform acceptably.  The district court heard extensive testimony on this point and found that the Hospital had satisfied its duties under this clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This might have been a close issue on the facts.  None of the doctors at the Hospital, including Dr. Klutz or Dr. Calabresi, testified to having told Dr. Zafar explicitly that upon his early transfer to surgery he would not receive credit for completing an ACGME-certified internship.  To be sure, Dr. Zafar admitted that he knew the Hospital did not have an accredited residency program in surgery.  This admission was perhaps not damning to his case, however, because there was evidence, supra, that Dr. Zafar might have rotated to surgery at some later point within the accredited \"rotating internship\" for which he originally contracted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguably, Dr. Zafar misunderstood the import of his enforced transfer to surgery and underestimated the seriousness of his situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the contract did not require written notice, and the district court found that Dr. Zafar had orally received \"actual notice\" of his predicament at the October 7, 1983, meeting with Dr. Klutz.  As a result, the court found that Dr. Zafar was properly \"charged with knowledge\" of his situation, and that \"he had an opportunity for discussion and for hearing to contest those allegations if he wanted to pursue that matter, and he chose not to pursue that avenue.\"  These findings are sufficiently supported by the evidence.  Dr. Zafar admitted that there had been questions about his performance, and Dr. Klutz testified that he told Dr. Zafar his evaluations had been unsatisfactory and that he believed that Dr. Zafar knew the seriousness of his situation.  Dr. Zafar also stopped doing rounds with the residents in the approved medicine program.  Moreover, Dr. Zafar received the memo from Dr. Vito that he would be transferring to surgery, when he had expected to be in internal medicine for at least six months and knew that surgery was not accredited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is significant that Dr. Zafar's testimony directly contradicted that of Dr. Klutz, leaving the court-upon believing Dr. Klutz-with understandable doubts about</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Zafar's credibility generally.  The district court's findings rested, in significant part, on determinations of the credibility of the witnesses, for which we are required to give \"due regard.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).  In discussing the crucial October 7 meeting between Dr. Zafar and Dr. Klutz (which Dr. Zafar essentially denied ever took place), the district court stated:  \"Doctor Klutz has his notes of that meeting and I believe his testimony as to what occurred at that meeting.\"  The court said that it was</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>satisfied that Doctor Klutz's testimony is accurate and at that meeting on October 7, 1983, Doctor Klutz told the plaintiff of his unsatisfactory evaluation in the same terms that Doctor Burtt had related to Doctor Klutz, and that he told him of the options-that the plaintiff, at that point, was not to be kept in the accredited program and he had two choices.  He could seek an appointment to another Hospital or he could go on to an internship in surgery which, by the plaintiff's own testimony, he knew was not an accredited program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also stated that it was convinced that \"Dr. Klutz told [Dr. Zafar] that he ought to talk to Doctor Burtt\" about his negative evaluations, but that Dr. Zafar never did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge contrasted the believability of Dr. Klutz with that of Dr. Zafar:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>It's obvious what the plaintiff was doing here during his testimony at the beginning of this case.  He was trying to convince the Court that he was blissfully ignorant of what was going on around him at the time;  that he didn't realize that those in the internal medicine program were dissatisfied with his performance to the point of expelling him from that program....  The attempt of the plaintiff to portray this ignorance ... is disingenuous, and that's as polite as I can make it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these credibility determinations and factual findings, the district court concluded that Dr. Zafar had received actual notice and had received an opportunity for discussion of his performance.  This resolution of the evidence is not clearly erroneous.   See Anderson v. Bessemer City, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 574 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Zafar also argues cursorily that he was denied constitutional due process rights.  The district court found that the due process mechanism in the contract did not import constitutional standards.  Especially as the Hospital is not a state actor, we accept that conclusion.  See, e.g., National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Tarkanian, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></span>, 191 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
