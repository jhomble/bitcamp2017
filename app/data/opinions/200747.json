Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Thomas J.

I agree with the remand of the plaintiff's claim against\n\nthe Coast Guard for interference with communications between the\n\ncommercial salvor and NORTHERN VOYAGER.               I respectfully disagree,\n\nhowever, with the majority's reasoning, its holding, and with the\n\nscope of the remand.\n\n             First, I am decidedly in disagreement with the majority's\n\nrecognition of authority by the Coast Guard to forcefully remove\n\nthe master of a vessel17 from his ship, thus preventing him from\n\ncontinuing efforts to save it.               With due respect, there is no\n\nauthority in law, practice, or maritime tradition that validates\n\nsuch action by the Coast Guard, nor am I aware of the government's\n\nhaving claimed such extraordinary powers before the inception of\n\nthis case.     Because the Coast Guard lacked the authority to remove\n\nthe NORTHERN VOYAGER's master from his vessel against his will, the\n\ndiscretionary function exception relied upon by the government is\n\ninapposite.         See Hatahley v. United States, 351 U.S. 173, 181\n\n(1956)     (holding    that   an   agent     acting    outside   his   delegated\n\nauthority      is    not   protected    by     the    discretionary     function\n\nexception); Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians v. United States, 800\n\nF.2d 1187, 1196 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (holding that a \"decision cannot\n\nbe shielded from liability if the decisionmaker is acting without\n\nactual authority\"); Birnbaum v. United States, 588 F.2d 319, 329\n\n\n     17\n          And volunteering officers.\n\n                                       -44-\n\f(2d Cir. 1978) (holding that \"discretionary function can derive\n\nonly from properly delegated authority\").\n\n           The new, misguided doctrine promoted by the government in\n\nthis appeal will have far reaching implications for the maritime\n\nand marine insurance industries.           At a minimum, it will result in\n\na shift in the decision-making responsibility for the safety and\n\nsalvage   of   a   ship    from   the    person    best   qualified   and    most\n\nknowledgeable regarding his vessel, the master, to a governmental\n\nagency that, as well intentioned as it may be in its actions, is\n\nnot even required by law to engage in any rescue attempt.                     See\n\ninfra I(B)(1).      In effect, the Coast Guard is now empowered to\n\narrive at the scene, forcibly remove the ship's captain, and leave\n\nthe scene of the marine casualty without any duty of engaging in\n\nany attempt to save the vessel.\n\n           Such     a     momentous     shift     in   policy   and   such    an\n\nextraordinary grant of authority should not be undertaken absent a\n\nclear legislative mandate expressed both in the text of the statute\n\nand in its legislative history.           Ordinarily, major policy changes\n\nof this nature are the result of an unambiguous Congressional\n\ngrant, written in plain language, enacted after considerable public\n\nhearings and input from the affected public, thus providing the\n\ncourts with clear guidance in its judicial function. In this case,\n\none looks in vain for such background or guidance.              It is nowhere\n\nto be found.       The government asks this Court to take a leap of\n\n\n                                        -45-\n\ffaith based on its say, and with a dearth of authority.                   The very\n\nfact that there is no judicial decision, legislative history or\n\nprior claims to such powers, notwithstanding the over 39,000\n\nmaritime rescue interventions effectuated every year by the Coast\n\nGuard,18     speaks   volumes   about        the   government's   claim      to   the\n\nexistence of such power.             See General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429\n\nU.S. 125, 143 (1976) (citing United Housing Foundation, Inc. v.\n\nForman, 421 U.S. 837, 858-59, n.25 (1975); Espinoza v. Farah Mfg.\n\nCo., 414 U.S. 86, 94 (1973)) (noting that courts have refused to\n\nfollow administrative guidelines when they conflict with past\n\npronouncements of an agency); see also Motor Vehicles Mfrs. Ass'n\n\nv.   State     Farm   Mut.   Auto.    Ins.    Co.,   463   U.S.   29,   57   (1983)\n\n(requiring an agency to provide reasoned analysis before changing\n\nits standards).\n\n              The majority's reliance by analogy on state police power\n\nlegislation19 is particularly inappropriate considering that the\n\nfederal government lacks a similar police power. See Lottery Case,\n\n188 U.S. 321 (1903) (holding \"that there is no such thing as a\n\nFederal police power except in respect of those specific subjects\n\ndelegated to Congress, such as treason, counterfeiting, piracies\n\n\n      18\n           U.S. Coast Guard, 2002 Coast Guard Ann. Rep.\n      19\n      Analogies between state and federal statutes can be a\nhazardous enterprise. See, e.g., Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v.\nAtchison, Topeka & Sante Fe Ry. Co., 470 U.S. 451, 470 (1985)\n(refusing to transfer, by analogy, the wording of a state statute\ninto a federal statute.)\n\n                                        -46-\n\fand felonies on the high seas and offences against the laws of\n\nnations\"). Although I will discuss this point more fully below, it\n\nshould be noted that the state statutes cited as authority for\n\nforcible    removals    in   land-based      emergencies   contain     specific\n\nstatutory language or have legislative histories granting such\n\nauthority.       These state statutes and authorities are particularly\n\ninapposite to the quintessential maritime scenario presented by\n\nthis appeal, one which should be properly guided solely by the\n\nuniquely federal admiralty laws, practices and traditions.                   See\n\nU.S. Const. art. III, § 2 (specifically extending federal judicial\n\npower to \"all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction\"); Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 9(h), 14(c), 38(e), & 82 (applying a distinct set of\n\nrules for admiralty cases); see generally Thomas J. Schoenbaum,\n\nAdmiralty and Maritime Law § 3-2 (3d ed. 2001) (explaining the\n\nuniqueness of admiralty law).\n\n            I.     Discretionary immunity only applies if the actor\n                   had actual authority\n\n\n            Discretionary immunity protects government decisions from\n\ntort liability only when the decision-maker is acting within the\n\nscope of his actual authority.          See, e.g., Hatahley, 351 U.S. at\n\n180-81 (holding that the discretionary function does not apply\n\nwhere the decision-maker lacks authority); K.W. Thompson Tool Co.\n\nv. United States, 836 F.2d 721, 727 n.4 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating\n\nthat   a   \"decision    cannot   be   shielded    from     liability    if   the\n\n\n                                      -47-\n\fdecisionmaker       is    acting     without      actual       authority\")        (internal\n\ncitation      and   quotations       omitted);     Red        Lake    Band   of    Chippewa\n\nIndians, 800 F.2d at 1196-97 (determining that unauthorized actions\n\nare not shielded from liability under the discretionary function\n\nexception); Birnbaum, 588 F.2d at 329-30.                      The majority correctly\n\npresented this aspect of the discretionary function test. However,\n\nthe   majority      incorrectly       concluded     that       the     Coast   Guard    had\n\nauthority to order the evacuation of the NORTHERN VOYAGER.\n\n              The issue upon which I most ardently disagree with the\n\nmajority is whether the Coast Guard, when asked to provide salvage\n\nassistance to a stricken vessel, has authority under 14 U.S.C.\n\n§ 88, or any other statute, to compel an unwilling master to quit\n\nsalvage efforts          and   to   evacuate      his    vessel       when   Coast    Guard\n\npersonnel determine that further salvage efforts would be futile or\n\ndangerous.\n\n              A.    14 U.S.C. § 88 does                 not    give    the   Coast    Guard\n                    unbridled authority\n\n              Whatever the scope of 14 U.S.C. § 88, the statute does\n\nnot confer unlimited authority upon Coast Guard officials to act in\n\nany way they see fit merely because they are engaged in rescue\n\nefforts.       It is true that the statute's cryptic direction to\n\n\"perform any and all acts necessary\" may sound like a grant of\n\nunlimited      authority       to   the   Coast    Guard.20           Nevertheless,     the\n\n\n      20\n           In pertinent part, 14 U.S.C. § 88 provides:\n\n\n                                          -48-\n\flanguage does not empower the Coast Guard, in a rescue context, to\n\nissue orders without regard to the statute's purpose or the rights\n\nof private citizens.\n\n              A glance at identical language from analogous federal\n\nstatutes reveals that Congress cannot have intended such \"any and\n\nall   acts\"    provisions   to   constitute   an   independent   grant   of\n\nunbounded authority.21      In nearly every instance in which Congress\n\n\n      (a) In order to render aid to distressed persons,\n      vessels, and aircraft on and under the high seas and on\n      and under the waters over which the United States has\n      jurisdiction and in order to render aid to persons and\n      property imperiled by flood, the Coast Guard may:\n      (1) perform any and all acts necessary to rescue and aid\n      persons and protect and save property;\n      (2) take charge of and protect all property saved from\n      marine or aircraft disasters, or floods, at which the\n      Coast Guard is present, until such property is claimed by\n      persons legally authorized to receive it or until\n      otherwise disposed of in accordance with law or\n      applicable regulations, and care for bodies of those who\n      may have perished in such catastrophes;\n      (3) furnish clothing, food, lodging, medicines, and other\n      necessary supplies and services to persons succored by\n      the Coast Guard.\n      21\n      Historically, Congress has only employed the phrase \"any and\nall acts\" when furnishing a newly-created administrative agency or\nprogram with sufficient flexibility to accomplish its central\nstatutory purposes. See, e.g., 16 U.S.C. § 583j-2 (establishing a\nfoundation under the supervision of the Forest Service and\nauthorizing that foundation to perform \"any and all acts necessary\nand proper\" to carry out the purposes of the foundation); 16 U.S.C.\n§ 3703 (authorizing the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to\nperform \"any and all acts necessary and proper\"); 20 U.S.C. § 5509\n(establishing the National Environmental Education and Training\nFoundation and authorizing the Foundation to perform \"any and all\nacts necessary and proper\"); 43 U.S.C. § 373 (authorizing the\nSecretary of the Interior to perform \"any and all acts\" to make\nrules necessary to implement a program of reclamation and\nirrigation of lands by the federal government).\n\n                                    -49-\n\fhas granted an agency authority to \"perform any and all acts\n\nnecessary\" to further some legislative goal, it is evident from the\n\ncontext that the provision grants an agency general implementary\n\npowers, but is not intended to expand the scope of that agency's\n\npowers   \"beyond    those   that   may    fairly   be   implied   from   the\n\nsubstantive sections and the functions there defined.\"            See PSC of\n\nNew York v. FERC, 866 F.2d 487, 492 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (citing Mobil\n\nOil Corp. v. FPC, 483 F.2d 1238 (D.C. Cir. 1973)).\n\n          Not      surprisingly,   when     construing    other    statutes\n\nemploying this phrase, this Court has found that the phrase \"any\n\nand all acts\" does not itself grant independent powers, but merely\n\nprovides for implementation of the core purposes of the statute.\n\nFor example, when construing analogous language from the Federal\n\nPower Act, we concluded:\n\n     While the Federal Power Act contains a \"necessary and\n     appropriate\" provision, see 16 U.S.C. § 825h (granting\n     FERC \"power to perform any and all acts, and to\n     prescribe, issue, make, amend, and rescind such orders,\n     rules, and regulations as it may find necessary and\n     appropriate\"), that provision merely augments whatever\n     existing powers have been conferred on FERC by Congress,\n     without itself comprising a source of independent\n     authority to act.\n\nBoston Edison Co. v. FERC, 856 F.2d 361, 369-70 (1st Cir. 1988)\n\n(emphasis in the original) (internal citations omitted); see also\n\n\n     I think it self-evident that, despite conferring these\nagencies with the power to perform \"any and all acts\" in\nfurtherance of some statutory purpose, Congress did not thereby\nconfer unfettered authority upon agencies such as the Forest\nService or National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.\n\n                                   -50-\n\fNew England Power Co. v. FPC, 467 F.2d 425, 430-31 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1972).\n\n             The phrase \"any and all acts\" authorizes the Coast Guard\n\nto implement and maintain a capability to conduct search and rescue\n\noperations.      The phrase does not literally mean that the Coast\n\nGuard may perform any action that is tangentially rescue-related,\n\nwithout regard to that action's lawfulness, or proper delegation,\n\nor potential impact on the rights of civilian mariners.22\n\n             The majority recognizes the logic of this argument in\n\npart when it notes that the Coast Guard's power under the statute\n\nis not unbridled.        Maj. Op. at II(B)(3).   To avoid giving the Coast\n\nGuard the unlimited power it claims, yet still give it enough\n\nauthority to meet the discretionary immunity test, the majority\n\njudicially creates a limitation to § 88 out of whole cloth.              It\n\nholds     that   Coast    Guard   authority   exists   only   during   life-\n\nthreatening situations when there is an objectively reasonable\n\nbelief by safety officers that a true emergency exists and there is\n\nan immediate need for assistance or aid.         Needless to say, there is\n\nno mention of such a limitation in the congressional history or in\n\nprevious case law regarding § 88, yet the majority depends on this\n\nlimitation to uphold the proposition that the Coast Guard had\n\n\n     22\n      To indulge in hypotheticals: while the statute would\nundoubtedly authorize the Coast Guard to spend money and to use\nlabor conducting a rescue, it plainly would not authorize the Coast\nGuard to shoot an obstreperous mariner who refused to comply with\nthe suggestions of Coast Guardsmen providing rescue assistance.\n\n                                     -51-\n\factual authority.\n\n           The problem with judicial legislation is that it often\n\nconflicts with the wording and intent of the statute.            Such is the\n\npresent case.      The majority's creation conflicts with the very\n\npurpose of the discretionary function exception. The \"basis of the\n\ndiscretionary function exception was Congress' desire to prevent\n\njudicial second guessing.\"         Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S.\n\n531, 536-37 (1988) (internal citation and quotations omitted).\n\nOnce   a   court      determines    that     an    agency's    decision     was\n\ndiscretionary, it is not thereafter free to determine whether the\n\ndecision-maker     properly     perceived    the   emergency    to   be   life-\n\nthreatening   and     whether     such   a   perception   was    objectively\n\nreasonable.      An    agency's    discretionary     decisions   are      immune\n\n\"whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\"              28 U.S.C. §\n\n2680(a).   Therefore, once a decision is deemed to be the kind of\n\ndecision the exception was designed to shield, this Court's inquiry\n\nmust come to an end.       As the Supreme Court concluded, \"where the\n\ngovernment is performing a discretionary function, the fact that\n\nthe discretion is exercised in a negligent manner does not make\n\n[the exception] inapplicable.\" Attallah v. United States, 955 F.2d\n\n776, 784 n.13 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing Dalehite v. United States,\n\n346 U.S. 15, 33 (1952); Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 539)) (further\n\ncitations omitted).      Likewise, where the Coast Guard is performing\n\na discretionary function, the fact that the decision-maker wrongly\n\n\n                                     -52-\n\fperceived the situation to be life-threatening will not make the\n\nexception inapplicable.\n\n          The    better   and,   in   my   belief,   the   only   correct\n\ninterpretation of § 88 is one that does not require judicial\n\nlegislation.    Like statutes with similar language, § 88 grants the\n\nCoast Guard general implementary powers.        It does not grant the\n\nCoast Guard the authority to threaten an unwilling master to\n\nevacuate his vessel if Coast Guard personnel determine that further\n\nsalvage efforts would be dangerous.\n\n     I am unaware of any case or authority, nor does the majority\n\ncite to any, conferring such sweeping authority upon the Coast\n\nGuard in the search and rescue context, other than the statute in\n\nquestion.23    Keeping these general limitations in mind, we turn to\n\n\n     23\n      The majority also cites Coast Guard Manuals to support the\nproposition that the Coast Guard has actual authority during\nsearch and rescue operations to forcefully remove a ship's crew.\nFirst, I do not read any language in that Manual indicating that\nthe Coast Guard has the authority to force a master off his vessel.\nSecond, Coast Guard manuals do no more than serve as a \"training\nand operational tool\" for search and rescue operations. U.S. Coast\nGuard, National Search and Rescue Manual (1991). They are nothing\nmore than \"reference documents\" to aid the Coast Guard and other\nrescue groups outside the Coast Guard. See U.S. Coast Guard, Coast\nGuard Addendum to the National Search and Rescue Manual. By no\nmeans can a manual create authority for the Coast Guard when no\nsuch power has been authorized by Congress.               See also\nChristensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000) (reiterating\nthat statutory \"interpretations contained in . . . agency manuals\"\ndo not warrant deference.)     Third, the United States National\nSearch and Rescue Supplement recognized that Coast Guard negligence\n\"may, in some circumstances, create legal liability\" if an\n\"attempted rescue . . . is conducted so that it . . . worsens the\nsituation of . . . one in distress.\" National Search and Rescue\nCommittee, United States National Search and Rescue Supplement to\n\n                                  -53-\n\fthe substantive language and purpose of § 88 to determine whether\n\nthe Coast Guard's evacuation order was within the permissible range\n\nof actions authorized by the statute.\n\n               B.     Scope of authority\n\n               The Coast Guard is the historical product of five federal\n\nagencies.24         In 1915 \"the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S.\n\nLifesaving Service were merged to form a new agency, the U.S. Coast\n\nGuard.\"       D.C.

In the 1930s and 1940s the Coast Guard absorbed the U.S.\n\nLighthouse Service, the Steamboat Inspection Service and the Bureau\n\nof Navigation.         Id.   In 1967, the Coast Guard was transferred from\n\nthe Treasury Department to the Department of Transportation.                 Id.\n\nIn 2003, the Coast Guard was transferred to the Department of\n\nHomeland Security.           See 6 U.S.C.S. § 101 (2003).\n\n               It     thus   appears     that   the   Coast    Guard,   or   its\n\npredecessors, has been with us since the inception of the Republic.\n\n\nthe International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue\nManual (May 2000).\n        24\n      The agencies that merged into the Coast Guard are:        the\nUnited States Lighthouse Service (1 Stat. L. 53) (1789); the\nRevenue Cutter Service (12 Stat. L., 639) (1863); the Steamboat\nInspection Service (10 Stat. L., 1852) (1852); the U.S. Life-Saving\nService (20 Stat. L., 163) (1878); and the Bureau of Navigation (23\nStat., L. 118) (1884).\n\n                                         -54-\n\fYet, in all of its various forms there is not a single reported\n\ncase, not a shred of documented evidence, not an iota of coherent\n\nlegislative history, sanctioning the exercise of the extraordinary\n\nexecutive powers claimed by the Coast Guard in this case.\n\n            The    earliest     Congressional      statutes   authorizing   a\n\ngovernment agency to perform search and water rescues provided that\n\nrescuers could only aid distressed sailors.             See Act of Dec. 22,\n\n1837, ch. 1, 5 Stat. 208 (1837) (cited in The Huntsville, 12 F.Cas.\n\n996 (E.D.S.C. 1860) (No. 6916) (Congress authorized the President\n\n\"to cause . . . public vessels . . . to cruise upon the coast, in\n\nthe severe portion of the season . . . to afford such aid to\n\ndistressed navigators as their circumstance and necessities may\n\nrequire; and such public vessels shall go to sea prepared fully to\n\nrender such assistance\")).        The authority granted by this original\n\nstatute   was     only   to   \"aid\"   navigators   as   \"their\"   necessities\n\nrequired.       See id.       Other Congressional legislation similarly\n\nestablished Coast Guard stations and provided Coast Guard funding\n\nfor the purpose of \"assisting vessels . . . from the perils of the\n\nsea.\"   Act of Apr. 19, 1906, ch. 1640, 34 Stat. 123; see also Act\n\nof Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601 (providing funding for\n\ncutters to be used for \"rendering aid to vessels in distress\"); Act\n\nof June 24, 1914, ch. 124, 38 Stat. 387 (providing funding for two\n\ncutters to provide medical aid to vessels engaged in the deep-sea\n\nfisheries); Act of May 12, 1906, ch. 2454, 34 Stat. 190 (providing\n\n\n                                      -55-\n\ffunding for a steam vessel to provide service at sea).\n\n          Similar to previous statutes granting a governmental\n\nagency the power to \"aid\" distressed sailors, under § 88, Congress\n\ngranted the Coast Guard broad powers to \"render aid,\" \"rescue and\n\naid\" and \"furnish clothing, food, lodging, medicines, and other\n\nnecessary supplies\" to distressed persons and vessels.          14 U.S.C.\n\n§ 88 (a)(3).    Neither the history of § 88 nor case law interpreting\n\n§ 88 support the proposition that the Coast Guard has the authority\n\nto force a master to evacuate his vessel.\n\n          Cases involving § 88 focus exclusively on two issues.\n\nFirst, courts uniformly hold that the Coast Guard is legally\n\nindistinguishable from private mariners regarding its duty to\n\nrescue.25 See, e.g., In re American Oil Co., 417 F.2d 164, 168 (5th\n\nCir. 1969). Second, reviewing courts have concluded that the Coast\n\nGuard becomes liable for an attempted rescue when its actions fail\n\nto   comply    with   standards   of   ordinary   care   and   acceptable\n\nseamanship.    United States v. Sandra & Dennis Fishing Corp., 372\n\nF.2d 189, 195 (1st Cir. 1967).\n\n                 1.    Duty to rescue\n\n          The Coast Guard does not have a duty to provide aid or\n\n\n\n     25\n      The majority disagrees and contends that, in circumstances\nsuch as the present, Coast Guard operations are relevantly\ndifferent from the situation in which a private vessel comes to the\nrescue of a distressed vessel. Maj. Op. at II(B)(3). Once again,\nthe majority makes such an assertion without any supporting\ncitations or referenced authority.\n\n                                  -56-\n\frescue services to distressed persons or vessels.     See Sagan v.\n\nUnited States, 342 F.3d 493, 498 (6th Cir. 2003) (finding that\n\n\"[t]he United States Coast Guard does not have an affirmative duty\n\nto rescue persons in distress\"); Sandra & Dennis Fishing, 372 F.2d\n\nat 195 (finding that the Coast Guard is under no obligation to\n\n\"provide rescue service on demand\").   So while § 88 empowers the\n\nCoast Guard to maintain rescue facilities and carry out rescue\n\nefforts, the Coast Guard is legally indistinguishable from a\n\nprivate salvor when it comes to providing rescue assistance.\n\nAccordingly,\n\n     [t]he Coast Guard, like a private salvor, renders\n     voluntary assistance where no duty to help is owed the\n     person or vessel in distress. True, it is a statutory\n     function of the Coast Guard to establish and operate\n     rescue facilities. Congress has also provided that the\n     \"Coast Guard may render aid to persons and protect and\n     save property at any time and at any place at which Coast\n     Guard facilities and personnel are available and can be\n     effectively utilized.\" 14 U.S.C. § 88(b).       But this\n     legislation falls short of creating a governmental duty\n     of affirmative action owed to a person or vessel in\n     distress.\n\nIn re American Oil, 417 F.2d at 168 (quoting Frank v. United\n\nStates, 250 F.2d 178, 180 (3d Cir. 1957)) (internal citation\n\nomitted).    Thus while § 88 authorizes the Coast Guard to conduct\n\nrescues, it does not impose any affirmative duty to do so.\n\n                2.   Acceptable seamanship standard\n\n            Once the Coast Guard engages in aid or rescue efforts,\n\nthe United States, like its private counterparts, will be liable\n\nonly where there is a failure to carry out the rescue mission or\n\n                                -57-\n\faid   in   accordance     with      standards       of    \"acceptable        seamanship.\"\n\nSandra & Dennis Fishing, 372 F.2d at 197.                              That means that\n\n\"[w]hatever may be the limits of this principle with respect to\n\nvolunteered salvage, we believe that if the Coast Guard accepts a\n\nmission    it   should    conduct         its    share    of    the    proceeding      with\n\nacceptable seamanship.\"            Id. (internal citation omitted).\n\n            Thus,      once   the    Coast       Guard    begins      providing   rescue\n\nassistance to a distressed vessel or persons, its authority under\n\n§ 88 is bounded by the duty of \"acceptable seamanship\" it owes to\n\nthe vessel owner or distressed persons.                   Whatever else may be said\n\nabout the limits of the statute, § 88 cannot be construed in a\n\nmanner which would vitiate the Coast Guard's duty of \"acceptable\n\nseamanship\"     when     carrying        out     volunteer      salvage      services    to\n\ndistressed vessels or persons.\n\n            Therefore         we    are       presented        with    the     relatively\n\nstraightforward        question     of     whether       the   Coast    Guard's   forced\n\nevacuation order was consistent with principles of \"acceptable\n\nseamanship.\"        I conclude it was not.                     Had a private salvor\n\ncoercively compelled the master and crew to quit salvage efforts\n\nand abandon the NORTHERN VOYAGER, there is no question but that the\n\ncase would      have    proceeded        to     trial    to    determine     whether    the\n\nsalvor's    actions     affirmatively           worsened       the    condition   of    the\n\nvessel. Here, the Coast Guard, acting in its capacity as a private\n\nsalvor, violated numerous principles of \"acceptable seamanship\" by\n\n\n                                           -58-\n\fcompelling    the     master   to    abandon       the   NORTHERN   VOYAGER   and\n\nwrongfully    depriving    him      of   the     opportunity   to   halt   further\n\nflooding of the vessel and await commercial salvage assistance.\n\n                    3.   Right to refuse unwanted salvage assistance\n\n           Though there are no cases directly on point as to whether\n\nan order such as the one issued by the Coast Guard is within the\n\nbounds of \"acceptable seamanship,\"26 the law of salvage provides\n\nvaluable guidance on this issue.                Salvage law governs the rescue\n\nand salvage of vessels in marine peril.\n\n             One well-established principle is that shipowners and\n\nmasters have a right to refuse salvage assistance.                  The right to\n\nrefuse salvage is a firmly established right of vessel owners and\n\nmasters:     \"[u]nder nearly all supposable circumstances when the\n\nmaster is in command and control of his own ship he may refuse and\n\nreject salvage services, and no volunteer salvor can force on him,\n\nand be rewarded for, services which he forbids.\"                The Indian, 159\n\nF. 20, 25 (5th Cir. 1908).          This Court has previously acknowledged\n\nthe master's right to refuse unwanted assistance.                    In Hamburg-\n\nAmerican Line v. United States, we noted that \"salvage services may\n\nnot be forced on the unwilling.\" 168 F.2d 47, 56 (1st Cir. 1948).\n\nThis view is consistent with the Supreme Court's statement that\n\n\"salvage cannot be exacted for assistance forced upon a ship.\"\n\n\n\n     26\n      For good reason, as the Coast Guard lacks the authority to\nissue such an order.\n\n                                         -59-\n\fMerritt & Chapman Derrick & Wrecking Co. v. United States, 274 U.S.\n\n611, 613 (1927).   Other cases strongly support this interpretation\n\nof salvage law as well.27   See New Harbor Protection Co. v. Steamer\n\nCharles P. Chouteau, 5 F. 463, 464 (D. La. 1881) (holding that a\n\nmaster has \"a perfect right to decline any assistance that may be\n\noffered him: he should not be assisted against his will\").\n\n           The majority claims that dicta in two district court\n\ncases limits the right to decline salvage assistance to instances\n\nwhere only the owner's property interests are at stake.   First, it\n\nis important to remember that the majority is relying on mere\n\ndicta.    Second, this dicta is of dubious value because the rule\n\nespoused is contrary to the well-established law of salvage.\n\nThird, the dicta cited by the majority limits the right to decline\n\nsalvage assistance from a private salvor to instances when there is\n\ndanger of large losses of property to third persons or when the\n\n\n     27\n      Leading admiralty treatises also recognize that masters can\nreject salvage assistance. According to Martin J. Norris, \"[w]hen\nthe master is in command and control of his own ship he may refuse\nand reject salvage services.      A would-be salvor, under such\ncircumstances, cannot force his services on the distressed vessel.\"\nMartin J. Norris, The Law of Seamen § 9:39 (4th ed. 2002).\nAdditionally, even where a salvor's services have been accepted and\nassistance rendered, \"the salvor must cease his services when\nrequested to by the salved ship . . . . During the time that\nassistance is being rendered, the officers of the distressed vessel\nare at liberty to determine when the assistance rendered should be\nterminated.\" Id. Thomas J. Schoenbaum echoes this view: \"Salvage\ncannot be forced upon an owner or his agent in possession of the\nvessel; a salvor who acts without the express or implied consent of\nthe owner is a 'gratuitous intermeddler,' who is not entitled to\nany salvage award.\" Thomas J. Schoenbaum, 2 Admiralty and Maritime\nLaw § 16-1 (3d ed. 2001).\n\n                                -60-\n\fmaster's decision to decline salvage assistance was \"so palpably\n\nand so grossly wrong as to amount to positive misconduct in\n\nreference to the claims of humanity.\"       Ramsey v. Pohatcong, 77 F.\n\n996 (S.D.N.Y. 1896); Smit Americas, Inc. v. M/T Mantinia, 259 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 118, 134 (D.P.R. 2003).     The NORTHERN VOYAGER did not pose\n\na threat to the property of third persons.         Captain Haggerty's\n\ndecision to continue efforts to salvage his ship was also not so\n\n\"palpably and grossly wrong,\" evidenced by the fact that the ship\n\nremained upright for fifty-five minutes after he was forced to\n\nevacuate the NORTHERN VOYAGER, and afloat for some time after\n\ncapsizing, all of which was more than enough time to have saved his\n\nship, particularly if the Coast Guard had not interfered with the\n\nsalvor.    The Coast Guard has never claimed that there was any\n\nregulatory, military, or law enforcement basis for compelling the\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER's crew to evacuate their vessel.          All of the\n\nofficers   who   remained   aboard    the   NORTHERN   VOYAGER   freely\n\nvolunteered to do so, and there is no indication that any of them\n\nwere acting in a deranged or reckless manner.\n\n           The language of § 88, as well as the long line of cases\n\nholding that the Coast Guard is legally indistinguishable from a\n\nprivate party when providing voluntary salvage assistance, compel\n\nthe conclusion that the Coast Guard lacked authority and acted\n\noutside the bounds of \"acceptable seamanship\" forcing the crew to\n\n\n\n\n                                -61-\n\fabandon the NORTHERN VOYAGER.28\n\n                   4.     The Coast Guard is unlike state public safety\n                          officials\n\n               The lack of federal case law or legislative history\n\ngranting the Coast Guard authority to force a captain from his\n\nvessel has led the majority to analogize the actions of the Coast\n\nGuard     to   actions    of   state   public   officials   during   times    of\n\nemergencies on land. The majority concluded that it is \"reasonable\n\nto assume\" (emphasis added) that Congress intended to confer powers\n\nto the Coast Guard \"analogous to those possessed by state safety\n\nofficials, namely, the power to rescue a person even against his\n\nwill in life-threatening situations.\"             Maj. Op. at II(B)(3).       I\n\nfind such an assumption totally unwarranted and, like other parts\n\nof the majority opinion, unsupported by any authority.\n\n               First, there is nothing in the text of § 88 or its\n\nlegislative history to support such an assertion, and furthermore,\n\nthe assumption that Congress intended to confer such extraordinary\n\npowers    by    analogy   or   by   implication   is   in   itself   a   dubious\n\n\n     28\n      It is important to note that we are only concerned with the\nscope of authority of the Coast Guard under § 88 to assist\ndistressed persons, vessels, and aircraft on and under United\nStates waters. Nothing in the majority opinion or in this dissent\nshould be construed to apply to the Coast Guard in its military,\nlaw enforcement or regulatory capacities. Moreover, the right of\nthe Coast Guard to evacuate its own personnel from a distressed\nvessel is not at issue here; had the Coast Guard simply withdrawn\nits personnel from the NORTHERN VOYAGER, without ordering the\nNORTHERN VOYAGER's master and officers to evacuate as well, the\nappellant would have had no cause of action against the United\nStates.\n\n                                       -62-\n\fproposition.   See, e.g., Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 470 U.S. at\n\n470 (refusing to transfer, by analogy, the wording of a state\n\nstatute into a federal statute because \"neither the language of the\n\n[federal] statute nor the circumstances surrounding its passage\"\n\nsupported such an analogy).\n\n          Second, in those cases where courts have found that state\n\nsafety officials were specifically granted the power to force\n\npeople from their homes during life-threatening emergencies, that\n\npower had been authorized by specific legislative enactment.   See,\n\ne.g., Alaska Stat. § 18.70.075(a)(2) (granting the fire department\n\n\"authority to . . . order a person to leave a building\"); see also\n\nConn. Gen. Stat. § 7-313b; Del. Code Ann. tit. 16, § 6701A(2); N.H.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. § 154:7; Tenn. Code Ann. § 6-21-703; W. Va. Code\n\n§ 29-3A-1.     In contrast, there is no federal statute remotely\n\nsimilar to these state statutes specifically granting the Coast\n\nGuard authority to order a ship's master to abandon his vessel.\n\nMoreover, unlike state governments, the federal government does not\n\nhave a general police power -- something that is probably beyond\n\nthe authority of any branch of the federal government to create\n\nextra-constitutionally.   See Lottery Case, 188 U.S. 321 (1903).\n\n          Third, life-threatening emergencies on land are very\n\ndifferent from life-threatening emergencies at sea.     Many state\n\nstatutes grant the state governor or local authorities the power to\n\ndeclare an emergency which would result in a forced evacuation.\n\n\n                               -63-\n\fSee, e.g., Alaska Stat. 26.23.020; Fla. Stat. Ann. § 252.38; Me.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 37-B, § 742; Minn. Stat. Ann. § 12.21; Or.\n\nRev. Stat. §§ 401.305, 401.309; Tenn. Code Ann. § 58-2-118.              On\n\nland, it may be presumed that a trained law enforcement official\n\nhas more knowledge than an average person about an impending\n\nemergency, such as a storm or a fire.      At sea, however, a captain's\n\nexpertise regarding his ship places him in the best position to\n\ndetermine the actual peril of his vessel and how best to save it.\n\nCoast   Guardsmen,    unfamiliar   with   the   vessel   involved   in   the\n\nemergency, ought not be able to substitute their judgment for that\n\nof the master by forcing evacuation upon him.            In an emergency\n\nsituation, it is unwise for the least knowledgeable to command the\n\nmost knowledgeable.\n\n           Fourth, allowing the Coast Guard to dictate to the master\n\nhow to save his ship interferes with the vital relationship between\n\na master and his vessel.     As one expert on the duties of a master\n\nhas testified, a master \"has no umbilical cord of support.           He is\n\nthe sole decision maker and he lives with the responsibility that\n\nhe's got to discharge, under adverse and varied conditions, calling\n\nupon those levels of expertise at moments and when he's least\n\nexpecting it.\"       In re Exxon Valdez, 1995 WL 527990, at *5 (D.\n\nAlaska, Jan. 27, 1995).     The exigencies and realities of life at\n\nsea require that there be a rigid chain of command aboard a ship.\n\nA master's responsibility to his ship is nondelegable and should be\n\n\n                                   -64-\n\ffree from officious meddling.         Particularly in times of life-\n\nthreatening emergencies, it is unwise to interfere with the chain\n\nof command by forcing the master to succumb to the orders and\n\ndirections of an intervening governmental bureaucracy, particularly\n\none which ultimately disclaims responsibility for its actions.\n\n            II.   Coast Guard interference with the commercial salvor\n\n            I agree with the majority that there is sufficient\n\nevidence in the record to create a factual issue on the question of\n\nwhether the Coast Guard's interference with the commercial salvor's\n\ncommunications prevented him from pursuing salvage efforts and\n\nusing his diving capacity to find and plug the leak.        I disagree,\n\nhowever, with the majority's determination that the district court\n\ncorrectly granted summary judgment because plaintiffs failed to\n\nestablish a factual issue as to whether the Coast Guard was\n\nnegligent in delaying Goodridge, the commercial salvor, and as to\n\nwhether the Coast Guard was negligent in assuring Captain Haggerty\n\nthat   it   was   working   on   getting   outside   commercial   salvage\n\nassistance.\n\n            Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions,\n\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file show that there\n\nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\n\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.          Rosenberg v.\n\nCity of Everett, 328 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(c)).     We review an award of summary judgment de novo,\n\n\n                                   -65-\n\fconstruing the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs\n\nand resolving all reasonable inferences in their favor.    Id.\n\n          A.   The reliance argument\n\n          The parties agree that the Good Samaritan doctrine,\n\n\"which makes one person liable to another for breach of a duty\n\nvoluntarily assumed by affirmative conduct,\" applies to this case.\n\nGood v. Ohio Edison Co., 149 F.3d 413, 420 (6th Cir. 1998)\n\n(internal citations and quotations omitted). Coast Guard liability\n\nmay be established if the Coast Guard's statements \"mislead . . .\n\n[or] induce reliance upon a belief that it is providing something\n\nwhich, in fact, it is not providing.\"     Sandra & Dennis Fishing\n\nCorp., 372 F.2d at 195.\n\n          There are several statements in the record that create a\n\nfactual issue as to whether the Coast Guard falsely informed\n\nCaptain Haggerty that they were arranging for commercial assistance\n\nwhen, it is alleged, they were not. Captain Haggerty testified, in\n\na sworn affidavit, that \"[b]ecause the Coast Guard had told me that\n\nthey were working on arranging commercial assistance, I did not\n\nmake any calls on the radio . . . to call for help.\"   Haggerty also\n\nradioed Station Gloucester asking \"if there was anybody available,\n\nif there was any more pumps.\"   The Coast Guard responded that they\n\nwere \"working on that.\"    Haggerty allegedly relied on the Coast\n\nGuard's statements and believed them.   In fact, it is claimed that\n\neven as he was being forced off the NORTHERN VOYAGER, Haggerty\n\n\n                                -66-\n\freiterated to the Coast Guardsman that he wanted to remain aboard\n\nhis vessel, to stabilize it and await salvage assistance.\n\n          It is admitted that the Coast Guard never arranged for\n\ncommercial salvage assistance.29          Nor did they inquire whether\n\nanyone was available or whether there were any more pumps.\n\n          The majority discounts Haggerty's sworn testimony by\n\nconcluding that the \"natural assumption\" is that the Coast Guard's\n\nstatement that we are \"working on that\" referred to the impending\n\narrival of the cutter ADAK.   It is equally, if not a more \"natural\n\nassumption,\"   that   Haggerty's    question    asking    if     anyone   was\n\navailable referred to the availability of commercial salvors, who\n\nroutinely carry pumps aboard their ships.            Most important, this\n\nCourt must view all facts in favor of the nonmoving party.                Any\n\n\"natural assumptions,\" therefore, must be viewed in a light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiffs.       Keeping this in mind, it is clear\n\nthat there is enough evidence of detrimental reliance to warrant a\n\nremand on that issue as well.\n\n          B.   The delay argument\n\n          By   dissecting   the    record,     the    majority    drew    two\n\n\n     29\n      Congress has expressed concerns that the Coast Guard --\nacting as a private salvor -- may unduly interfere with commercial\nsalvage efforts. Such concerns led Congress, in 1982 legislation,\nto direct the Coast Guard to \"review Coast Guard policies and\nprocedures for towing and salvage of disabled vessels in order to\nfurther minimize the possibility of Coast Guard competition or\ninterference with private towing activities or other commercial\nenterprise.\" Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1982, Pub. L. No.\n97-322 § 113, 96 Stat. 1581 (1982).\n\n                                   -67-\n\fconclusions: first, the Coast Guard delayed Goodridge by, at most,\n\ntwelve minutes; and second, twelve minutes is not a significant\n\ndelay.   Both conclusions are wrong.\n\n           At 9:03 a.m., Goodridge called Station Gloucester to\n\ninform them that he had equipment and was available to assist in\n\nthe salvage efforts.       The Coast Guard responded that \"they were\n\nbusy and they were going to handle it . . . they didn't need any\n\nhelp.\" After being rebuffed by the Coast Guard, Goodridge returned\n\nto work and gathered his gear to prepare to salvage a boat that had\n\nsunk that morning.        Goodridge continued to listen to his radio\n\ntransmitting the communications regarding the NORTHERN VOYAGER.\n\nAfter further listening, Goodridge concluded that, despite what the\n\nCoast Guard had said, the NORTHERN VOYAGER would need his help.\n\nThus, at 9:15 a.m., Goodridge called Cape Ann Divers to inquire who\n\nwould be there to assist in a dive and to gather information.              At\n\n9:33 a.m. Goodridge called Station Gloucester again and informed\n\nthem that he was coming with equipment.               At this point, the\n\nmajority   is   correct    that,   at   most,   the   Coast   Guard   delayed\n\nGoodridge by twelve minutes.       But, the Coast Guard caused further\n\ndelay once Goodridge arrived at his boat.         Using the radio onboard\n\nhis boat, Goodridge attempted to contact the Coast Guard to ask if\n\n\"we should take the time to load pumps or just come with the dive\n\ngear.\" The Coast Guard responded: \"don't tie up the channel; we're\n\n\n\n\n                                    -68-\n\fbusy; don't tie up the channel.\"30          Since the Coast Guard did not\n\nrespond, Goodridge \"took the time\" to \"run the pumps down the\n\ndock.\"     It is unclear how much extra time this took, but viewing\n\nthe evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs, it is\n\nenough evidence to require a remand on this issue.                   This is\n\nespecially true considering that the repairs required by the\n\nNORTHERN    VOYAGER   would   have   taken    \"two   minutes   or   less\"   to\n\ncomplete31 and did not even require the use of additional pumps.\n\n            Further, even if it is assumed that Goodridge was delayed\n\nby only twelve minutes, viewing the evidence in a light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiff, it can be concluded that the delay was\n\nsignificant.32    Had the delay not occurred, Goodridge could have\n\narrived at the scene in time to communicate with Captain Haggerty.\n\nAt such time, further efforts could have been taken to save the\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER.     This issue should also be remanded since the\n\n\n\n     30\n       Goodridge originally radioed the Coast Guard on channel 16\nand, as is customary, told the Coast Guard to switch to Channel 22,\nthe channel where the NORTHERN VOYAGER communications were taking\nplace.    After switching to Channel 22, the Coast Guard asked\nGoodridge to switch to Channel 12. Upon doing so, Goodridge was\ntold not to \"tie up\" this non-emergency channel, despite the fact\nthat Channel 12 did not contain any emergency communications\nbetween the Coast Guard and the NORTHERN VOYAGER. Thus, in effect,\nthe Coast Guard silenced and isolated Goodridge's salvage attempts.\n     31\n      The evidence showed that all a diver had to do was plug the\nrudder shaft, a simple and quick maneuver.\n     32\n      This evidence should also be viewed in light of the fact that\nthe NORTHERN VOYAGER was afloat for about one hour after the master\nwas forced to abandon it and to cease efforts to save it.\n\n                                     -69-\n\fdelay could have led to the demise of the NORTHERN VOYAGER.\n\n          III. Conclusion\n\n          Most   respectfully,    I     strongly   disagree   with   the\n\nmajority's holding that the Coast Guard has the power to remove a\n\nmaster of a vessel from his ship by threat of force, thereby\n\npreventing him from saving it.    My views are not some romantic or\n\narchaic notion to the effect that the \"captain should go down with\n\nthe ship,\"33 or a claim based on John Stuart Mill-like theories of\n\npersonal liberty and autonomy,34 although some might find such\n\narguments appealing.    Rather, they are based on the hard realities\n\nof the law of the sea as it has existed from time immemorial until\n\nthis case ensued.      The majority's unprecedented holding is not\n\nsupported by law, practice or maritime tradition.       It contradicts\n\nlegislative enactments and the very purpose of the discretionary\n\nfunction exception. Congress has never granted the Coast Guard the\n\nauthority to force a master to abandon his vessel.      Neither should\n\nthis Court.\n\n\n     33\n      Although such a tradition, which has not been altogether\nfanciful at different times, has served to establish a benchmark\nfor the commitment expected of a ship's captain toward his ship,\ncrew and passengers.\n     34\n      See John Stuart Mill, On Liberty 14 (John Gray ed., Oxford\nUniv. Press 1991) (1859) (\"[T]he sole end for which mankind are\nwarranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the\nliberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection [of\nsociety] . . . His own good, either physical or moral, is not a\nsufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or\nforbear because it will be better for him to do so . . . Over\nhimself, over his body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\")\n\n                                 -70-\n\f",

I agree with the remand of the plaintiff's claim against\n\nthe Coast Guard for interference with communications between the\n\ncommercial salvor and NORTHERN VOYAGER.               I respectfully disagree,\n\nhowever, with the majority's reasoning, its holding, and with the\n\nscope of the remand.\n\n             First, I am decidedly in disagreement with the majority's\n\nrecognition of authority by the Coast Guard to forcefully remove\n\nthe master of a vessel17 from his ship, thus preventing him from\n\ncontinuing efforts to save it.               With due respect, there is no\n\nauthority in law, practice, or maritime tradition that validates\n\nsuch action by the Coast Guard, nor am I aware of the government's\n\nhaving claimed such extraordinary powers before the inception of\n\nthis case.     Because the Coast Guard lacked the authority to remove\n\nthe NORTHERN VOYAGER's master from his vessel against his will, the\n\ndiscretionary function exception relied upon by the government is\n\ninapposite.

At a minimum, it will result in\n\na shift in the decision-making responsibility for the safety and\n\nsalvage   of   a   ship    from   the    person    best   qualified   and    most\n\nknowledgeable regarding his vessel, the master, to a governmental\n\nagency that, as well intentioned as it may be in its actions, is\n\nnot even required by law to engage in any rescue attempt.                     See\n\ninfra I(B)(1).      In effect, the Coast Guard is now empowered to\n\narrive at the scene, forcibly remove the ship's captain, and leave\n\nthe scene of the marine casualty without any duty of engaging in\n\nany attempt to save the vessel.\n\n           Such     a     momentous     shift     in   policy   and   such    an\n\nextraordinary grant of authority should not be undertaken absent a\n\nclear legislative mandate expressed both in the text of the statute\n\nand in its legislative history.           Ordinarily, major policy changes\n\nof this nature are the result of an unambiguous Congressional\n\ngrant, written in plain language, enacted after considerable public\n\nhearings and input from the affected public, thus providing the\n\ncourts with clear guidance in its judicial function. In this case,\n\none looks in vain for such background or guidance.              It is nowhere\n\nto be found.       The government asks this Court to take a leap of\n\n\n                                        -45-\n\ffaith based on its say, and with a dearth of authority.                   The very\n\nfact that there is no judicial decision, legislative history or\n\nprior claims to such powers, notwithstanding the over 39,000\n\nmaritime rescue interventions effectuated every year by the Coast\n\nGuard,18     speaks   volumes   about        the   government's   claim      to   the\n\nexistence of such power.

Although I will discuss this point more fully below, it\n\nshould be noted that the state statutes cited as authority for\n\nforcible    removals    in   land-based      emergencies   contain     specific\n\nstatutory language or have legislative histories granting such\n\nauthority.       These state statutes and authorities are particularly\n\ninapposite to the quintessential maritime scenario presented by\n\nthis appeal, one which should be properly guided solely by the\n\nuniquely federal admiralty laws, practices and traditions.

It is true that the statute's cryptic direction to\n\n\"perform any and all acts necessary\" may sound like a grant of\n\nunlimited      authority       to   the   Coast    Guard.20           Nevertheless,     the\n\n\n      20\n           In pertinent part, 14 U.S.C. § 88 provides:\n\n\n                                          -48-\n\flanguage does not empower the Coast Guard, in a rescue context, to\n\nissue orders without regard to the statute's purpose or the rights\n\nof private citizens.\n\n              A glance at identical language from analogous federal\n\nstatutes reveals that Congress cannot have intended such \"any and\n\nall   acts\"    provisions   to   constitute   an   independent   grant   of\n\nunbounded authority.21      In nearly every instance in which Congress\n\n\n      (a) In order to render aid to distressed persons,\n      vessels, and aircraft on and under the high seas and on\n      and under the waters over which the United States has\n      jurisdiction and in order to render aid to persons and\n      property imperiled by flood, the Coast Guard may:\n      (1) perform any and all acts necessary to rescue and aid\n      persons and protect and save property;\n      (2) take charge of and protect all property saved from\n      marine or aircraft disasters, or floods, at which the\n      Coast Guard is present, until such property is claimed by\n      persons legally authorized to receive it or until\n      otherwise disposed of in accordance with law or\n      applicable regulations, and care for bodies of those who\n      may have perished in such catastrophes;\n      (3) furnish clothing, food, lodging, medicines, and other\n      necessary supplies and services to persons succored by\n      the Coast Guard.\n      21\n      Historically, Congress has only employed the phrase \"any and\nall acts\" when furnishing a newly-created administrative agency or\nprogram with sufficient flexibility to accomplish its central\nstatutory purposes. See, e.g., 16 U.S.C. § 583j-2 (establishing a\nfoundation under the supervision of the Forest Service and\nauthorizing that foundation to perform \"any and all acts necessary\nand proper\" to carry out the purposes of the foundation); 16 U.S.C.\n§ 3703 (authorizing the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to\nperform \"any and all acts necessary and proper\"); 20 U.S.C. § 5509\n(establishing the National Environmental Education and Training\nFoundation and authorizing the Foundation to perform \"any and all\nacts necessary and proper\"); 43 U.S.C. § 373 (authorizing the\nSecretary of the Interior to perform \"any and all acts\" to make\nrules necessary to implement a program of reclamation and\nirrigation of lands by the federal government).\n\n                                    -49-\n\fhas granted an agency authority to \"perform any and all acts\n\nnecessary\" to further some legislative goal, it is evident from the\n\ncontext that the provision grants an agency general implementary\n\npowers, but is not intended to expand the scope of that agency's\n\npowers   \"beyond    those   that   may    fairly   be   implied   from   the\n\nsubstantive sections and the functions there defined.\"            See PSC of\n\nNew York v.

The phrase does not literally mean that the Coast\n\nGuard may perform any action that is tangentially rescue-related,\n\nwithout regard to that action's lawfulness, or proper delegation,\n\nor potential impact on the rights of civilian mariners.22\n\n             The majority recognizes the logic of this argument in\n\npart when it notes that the Coast Guard's power under the statute\n\nis not unbridled.        Maj. Op. at II(B)(3).   To avoid giving the Coast\n\nGuard the unlimited power it claims, yet still give it enough\n\nauthority to meet the discretionary immunity test, the majority\n\njudicially creates a limitation to § 88 out of whole cloth.              It\n\nholds     that   Coast    Guard   authority   exists   only   during   life-\n\nthreatening situations when there is an objectively reasonable\n\nbelief by safety officers that a true emergency exists and there is\n\nan immediate need for assistance or aid.         Needless to say, there is\n\nno mention of such a limitation in the congressional history or in\n\nprevious case law regarding § 88, yet the majority depends on this\n\nlimitation to uphold the proposition that the Coast Guard had\n\n\n     22\n      To indulge in hypotheticals: while the statute would\nundoubtedly authorize the Coast Guard to spend money and to use\nlabor conducting a rescue, it plainly would not authorize the Coast\nGuard to shoot an obstreperous mariner who refused to comply with\nthe suggestions of Coast Guardsmen providing rescue assistance.\n\n                                     -51-\n\factual authority.\n\n           The problem with judicial legislation is that it often\n\nconflicts with the wording and intent of the statute.            Such is the\n\npresent case.      The majority's creation conflicts with the very\n\npurpose of the discretionary function exception.

Likewise, where the Coast Guard is performing\n\na discretionary function, the fact that the decision-maker wrongly\n\n\n                                     -52-\n\fperceived the situation to be life-threatening will not make the\n\nexception inapplicable.\n\n          The    better   and,   in   my   belief,   the   only   correct\n\ninterpretation of § 88 is one that does not require judicial\n\nlegislation.    Like statutes with similar language, § 88 grants the\n\nCoast Guard general implementary powers.        It does not grant the\n\nCoast Guard the authority to threaten an unwilling master to\n\nevacuate his vessel if Coast Guard personnel determine that further\n\nsalvage efforts would be dangerous.\n\n     I am unaware of any case or authority, nor does the majority\n\ncite to any, conferring such sweeping authority upon the Coast\n\nGuard in the search and rescue context, other than the statute in\n\nquestion.23    Keeping these general limitations in mind, we turn to\n\n\n     23\n      The majority also cites Coast Guard Manuals to support the\nproposition that the Coast Guard has actual authority during\nsearch and rescue operations to forcefully remove a ship's crew.\nFirst, I do not read any language in that Manual indicating that\nthe Coast Guard has the authority to force a master off his vessel.\nSecond, Coast Guard manuals do no more than serve as a \"training\nand operational tool\" for search and rescue operations. U.S. Coast\nGuard, National Search and Rescue Manual (1991). They are nothing\nmore than \"reference documents\" to aid the Coast Guard and other\nrescue groups outside the Coast Guard. See U.S. Coast Guard, Coast\nGuard Addendum to the National Search and Rescue Manual.

Neither the history of § 88 nor case law interpreting\n\n§ 88 support the proposition that the Coast Guard has the authority\n\nto force a master to evacuate his vessel.\n\n          Cases involving § 88 focus exclusively on two issues.\n\nFirst, courts uniformly hold that the Coast Guard is legally\n\nindistinguishable from private mariners regarding its duty to\n\nrescue.25 See, e.g., In re American Oil Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"286873\"><a href=\"/opinion/286873/in-the-matter-of-the-libel-and-petition-of-the-american-oil-company-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168 (5th\n\nCir. 1969).

Maj. Op. at II(B)(3). Once again,\nthe majority makes such an assertion without any supporting\ncitations or referenced authority.\n\n                                  -56-\n\frescue services to distressed persons or vessels.

So while § 88 empowers the\n\nCoast Guard to maintain rescue facilities and carry out rescue\n\nefforts, the Coast Guard is legally indistinguishable from a\n\nprivate salvor when it comes to providing rescue assistance.\n\nAccordingly,\n\n     [t]he Coast Guard, like a private salvor, renders\n     voluntary assistance where no duty to help is owed the\n     person or vessel in distress. True, it is a statutory\n     function of the Coast Guard to establish and operate\n     rescue facilities. Congress has also provided that the\n     \"Coast Guard may render aid to persons and protect and\n     save property at any time and at any place at which Coast\n     Guard facilities and personnel are available and can be\n     effectively utilized.\" 14 U.S.C. § 88(b).       But this\n     legislation falls short of creating a governmental duty\n     of affirmative action owed to a person or vessel in\n     distress.\n\nIn re American Oil, 417 F.2d at 168 (quoting Frank v.

Thus while § 88 authorizes the Coast Guard to conduct\n\nrescues, it does not impose any affirmative duty to do so.\n\n                2.   Acceptable seamanship standard\n\n            Once the Coast Guard engages in aid or rescue efforts,\n\nthe United States, like its private counterparts, will be liable\n\nonly where there is a failure to carry out the rescue mission or\n\n                                -57-\n\faid   in   accordance     with      standards       of    \"acceptable        seamanship.\"\n\nSandra & Dennis Fishing, 372 F.2d at 197.                              That means that\n\n\"[w]hatever may be the limits of this principle with respect to\n\nvolunteered salvage, we believe that if the Coast Guard accepts a\n\nmission    it   should    conduct         its    share    of    the    proceeding      with\n\nacceptable seamanship.\"            Id. (internal citation omitted).\n\n            Thus,      once   the    Coast       Guard    begins      providing   rescue\n\nassistance to a distressed vessel or persons, its authority under\n\n§ 88 is bounded by the duty of \"acceptable seamanship\" it owes to\n\nthe vessel owner or distressed persons.                   Whatever else may be said\n\nabout the limits of the statute, § 88 cannot be construed in a\n\nmanner which would vitiate the Coast Guard's duty of \"acceptable\n\nseamanship\"     when     carrying        out     volunteer      salvage      services    to\n\ndistressed vessels or persons.\n\n            Therefore         we    are       presented        with    the     relatively\n\nstraightforward        question     of     whether       the   Coast    Guard's   forced\n\nevacuation order was consistent with principles of \"acceptable\n\nseamanship.\"        I conclude it was not.                     Had a private salvor\n\ncoercively compelled the master and crew to quit salvage efforts\n\nand abandon the NORTHERN VOYAGER, there is no question but that the\n\ncase would      have    proceeded        to     trial    to    determine     whether    the\n\nsalvor's    actions     affirmatively           worsened       the    condition   of    the\n\nvessel. Here, the Coast Guard, acting in its capacity as a private\n\nsalvor, violated numerous principles of \"acceptable seamanship\" by\n\n\n                                           -58-\n\fcompelling    the     master   to    abandon       the   NORTHERN   VOYAGER   and\n\nwrongfully    depriving    him      of   the     opportunity   to   halt   further\n\nflooding of the vessel and await commercial salvage assistance.\n\n                    3.   Right to refuse unwanted salvage assistance\n\n           Though there are no cases directly on point as to whether\n\nan order such as the one issued by the Coast Guard is within the\n\nbounds of \"acceptable seamanship,\"26 the law of salvage provides\n\nvaluable guidance on this issue.                Salvage law governs the rescue\n\nand salvage of vessels in marine peril.\n\n             One well-established principle is that shipowners and\n\nmasters have a right to refuse salvage assistance.                  The right to\n\nrefuse salvage is a firmly established right of vessel owners and\n\nmasters:     \"[u]nder nearly all supposable circumstances when the\n\nmaster is in command and control of his own ship he may refuse and\n\nreject salvage services, and no volunteer salvor can force on him,\n\nand be rewarded for, services which he forbids.\"                The Indian, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (5th Cir. 1908).

La. 1881) (holding that a\n\nmaster has \"a perfect right to decline any assistance that may be\n\noffered him: he should not be assisted against his will\").\n\n           The majority claims that dicta in two district court\n\ncases limits the right to decline salvage assistance to instances\n\nwhere only the owner's property interests are at stake.   First, it\n\nis important to remember that the majority is relying on mere\n\ndicta.    Second, this dicta is of dubious value because the rule\n\nespoused is contrary to the well-established law of salvage.\n\nThird, the dicta cited by the majority limits the right to decline\n\nsalvage assistance from a private salvor to instances when there is\n\ndanger of large losses of property to third persons or when the\n\n\n     27\n      Leading admiralty treatises also recognize that masters can\nreject salvage assistance. According to Martin J. Norris, \"[w]hen\nthe master is in command and control of his own ship he may refuse\nand reject salvage services.      A would-be salvor, under such\ncircumstances, cannot force his services on the distressed vessel.\"\nMartin J. Norris, The Law of Seamen § 9:39 (4th ed. 2002).\nAdditionally, even where a salvor's services have been accepted and\nassistance rendered, \"the salvor must cease his services when\nrequested to by the salved ship . . . . During the time that\nassistance is being rendered, the officers of the distressed vessel\nare at liberty to determine when the assistance rendered should be\nterminated.\" Id. Thomas J. Schoenbaum echoes this view: \"Salvage\ncannot be forced upon an owner or his agent in possession of the\nvessel; a salvor who acts without the express or implied consent of\nthe owner is a 'gratuitous intermeddler,' who is not entitled to\nany salvage award.\" Thomas J. Schoenbaum, 2 Admiralty and Maritime\nLaw § 16-1 (3d ed. 2001).\n\n                                -60-\n\fmaster's decision to decline salvage assistance was \"so palpably\n\nand so grossly wrong as to amount to positive misconduct in\n\nreference to the claims of humanity.\"       Ramsey v.

Captain Haggerty's\n\ndecision to continue efforts to salvage his ship was also not so\n\n\"palpably and grossly wrong,\" evidenced by the fact that the ship\n\nremained upright for fifty-five minutes after he was forced to\n\nevacuate the NORTHERN VOYAGER, and afloat for some time after\n\ncapsizing, all of which was more than enough time to have saved his\n\nship, particularly if the Coast Guard had not interfered with the\n\nsalvor.    The Coast Guard has never claimed that there was any\n\nregulatory, military, or law enforcement basis for compelling the\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER's crew to evacuate their vessel.          All of the\n\nofficers   who   remained   aboard    the   NORTHERN   VOYAGER   freely\n\nvolunteered to do so, and there is no indication that any of them\n\nwere acting in a deranged or reckless manner.\n\n           The language of § 88, as well as the long line of cases\n\nholding that the Coast Guard is legally indistinguishable from a\n\nprivate party when providing voluntary salvage assistance, compel\n\nthe conclusion that the Coast Guard lacked authority and acted\n\noutside the bounds of \"acceptable seamanship\" forcing the crew to\n\n\n\n\n                                -61-\n\fabandon the NORTHERN VOYAGER.28\n\n                   4.     The Coast Guard is unlike state public safety\n                          officials\n\n               The lack of federal case law or legislative history\n\ngranting the Coast Guard authority to force a captain from his\n\nvessel has led the majority to analogize the actions of the Coast\n\nGuard     to   actions    of   state   public   officials   during   times    of\n\nemergencies on land. The majority concluded that it is \"reasonable\n\nto assume\" (emphasis added) that Congress intended to confer powers\n\nto the Coast Guard \"analogous to those possessed by state safety\n\nofficials, namely, the power to rescue a person even against his\n\nwill in life-threatening situations.\"             Maj. Op. at II(B)(3).       I\n\nfind such an assumption totally unwarranted and, like other parts\n\nof the majority opinion, unsupported by any authority.\n\n               First, there is nothing in the text of § 88 or its\n\nlegislative history to support such an assertion, and furthermore,\n\nthe assumption that Congress intended to confer such extraordinary\n\npowers    by    analogy   or   by   implication   is   in   itself   a   dubious\n\n\n     28\n      It is important to note that we are only concerned with the\nscope of authority of the Coast Guard under § 88 to assist\ndistressed persons, vessels, and aircraft on and under United\nStates waters. Nothing in the majority opinion or in this dissent\nshould be construed to apply to the Coast Guard in its military,\nlaw enforcement or regulatory capacities. Moreover, the right of\nthe Coast Guard to evacuate its own personnel from a distressed\nvessel is not at issue here; had the Coast Guard simply withdrawn\nits personnel from the NORTHERN VOYAGER, without ordering the\nNORTHERN VOYAGER's master and officers to evacuate as well, the\nappellant would have had no cause of action against the United\nStates.\n\n                                       -62-\n\fproposition.   See, e.g., Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 470 U.S. at\n\n470 (refusing to transfer, by analogy, the wording of a state\n\nstatute into a federal statute because \"neither the language of the\n\n[federal] statute nor the circumstances surrounding its passage\"\n\nsupported such an analogy).\n\n          Second, in those cases where courts have found that state\n\nsafety officials were specifically granted the power to force\n\npeople from their homes during life-threatening emergencies, that\n\npower had been authorized by specific legislative enactment.   See,\n\ne.g., Alaska Stat. § 18.70.075(a)(2) (granting the fire department\n\n\"authority to . . . order a person to leave a building\"); see also\n\nConn. Gen. Stat. § 7-313b; Del. Code Ann. tit. 16, § 6701A(2); N.H.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. § 154:7; Tenn. Code Ann. § 6-21-703; W. Va. Code\n\n§ 29-3A-1.     In contrast, there is no federal statute remotely\n\nsimilar to these state statutes specifically granting the Coast\n\nGuard authority to order a ship's master to abandon his vessel.\n\nMoreover, unlike state governments, the federal government does not\n\nhave a general police power -- something that is probably beyond\n\nthe authority of any branch of the federal government to create\n\nextra-constitutionally.   See Lottery Case, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2421240\"><a href=\"/opinion/2421240/lottery-case/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1903).\n\n          Third, life-threatening emergencies on land are very\n\ndifferent from life-threatening emergencies at sea.     Many state\n\nstatutes grant the state governor or local authorities the power to\n\ndeclare an emergency which would result in a forced evacuation.\n\n\n                               -63-\n\fSee, e.g., Alaska Stat. 26.23.020; Fla. Stat. Ann. § 252.38; Me.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 37-B, § 742; Minn. Stat. Ann. § 12.21; Or.\n\nRev. Stat. §§ 401.305, 401.309; Tenn. Code Ann. § 58-2-118.              On\n\nland, it may be presumed that a trained law enforcement official\n\nhas more knowledge than an average person about an impending\n\nemergency, such as a storm or a fire.      At sea, however, a captain's\n\nexpertise regarding his ship places him in the best position to\n\ndetermine the actual peril of his vessel and how best to save it.\n\nCoast   Guardsmen,    unfamiliar   with   the   vessel   involved   in   the\n\nemergency, ought not be able to substitute their judgment for that\n\nof the master by forcing evacuation upon him.            In an emergency\n\nsituation, it is unwise for the least knowledgeable to command the\n\nmost knowledgeable.\n\n           Fourth, allowing the Coast Guard to dictate to the master\n\nhow to save his ship interferes with the vital relationship between\n\na master and his vessel.     As one expert on the duties of a master\n\nhas testified, a master \"has no umbilical cord of support.           He is\n\nthe sole decision maker and he lives with the responsibility that\n\nhe's got to discharge, under adverse and varied conditions, calling\n\nupon those levels of expertise at moments and when he's least\n\nexpecting it.\"       In re Exxon Valdez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">527990</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (D.\n\nAlaska, Jan. 27, 1995).     The exigencies and realities of life at\n\nsea require that there be a rigid chain of command aboard a ship.\n\nA master's responsibility to his ship is nondelegable and should be\n\n\n                                   -64-\n\ffree from officious meddling.         Particularly in times of life-\n\nthreatening emergencies, it is unwise to interfere with the chain\n\nof command by forcing the master to succumb to the orders and\n\ndirections of an intervening governmental bureaucracy, particularly\n\none which ultimately disclaims responsibility for its actions.\n\n            II.   Coast Guard interference with the commercial salvor\n\n            I agree with the majority that there is sufficient\n\nevidence in the record to create a factual issue on the question of\n\nwhether the Coast Guard's interference with the commercial salvor's\n\ncommunications prevented him from pursuing salvage efforts and\n\nusing his diving capacity to find and plug the leak.        I disagree,\n\nhowever, with the majority's determination that the district court\n\ncorrectly granted summary judgment because plaintiffs failed to\n\nestablish a factual issue as to whether the Coast Guard was\n\nnegligent in delaying Goodridge, the commercial salvor, and as to\n\nwhether the Coast Guard was negligent in assuring Captain Haggerty\n\nthat   it   was   working   on   getting   outside   commercial   salvage\n\nassistance.\n\n            Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions,\n\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file show that there\n\nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\n\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Coast Guard liability\n\nmay be established if the Coast Guard's statements \"mislead . . .\n\n[or] induce reliance upon a belief that it is providing something\n\nwhich, in fact, it is not providing.\"     Sandra & Dennis Fishing\n\nCorp., 372 F.2d at 195.\n\n          There are several statements in the record that create a\n\nfactual issue as to whether the Coast Guard falsely informed\n\nCaptain Haggerty that they were arranging for commercial assistance\n\nwhen, it is alleged, they were not. Captain Haggerty testified, in\n\na sworn affidavit, that \"[b]ecause the Coast Guard had told me that\n\nthey were working on arranging commercial assistance, I did not\n\nmake any calls on the radio . . . to call for help.\"   Haggerty also\n\nradioed Station Gloucester asking \"if there was anybody available,\n\nif there was any more pumps.\"   The Coast Guard responded that they\n\nwere \"working on that.\"    Haggerty allegedly relied on the Coast\n\nGuard's statements and believed them.   In fact, it is claimed that\n\neven as he was being forced off the NORTHERN VOYAGER, Haggerty\n\n\n                                -66-\n\freiterated to the Coast Guardsman that he wanted to remain aboard\n\nhis vessel, to stabilize it and await salvage assistance.\n\n          It is admitted that the Coast Guard never arranged for\n\ncommercial salvage assistance.29          Nor did they inquire whether\n\nanyone was available or whether there were any more pumps.\n\n          The majority discounts Haggerty's sworn testimony by\n\nconcluding that the \"natural assumption\" is that the Coast Guard's\n\nstatement that we are \"working on that\" referred to the impending\n\narrival of the cutter ADAK.   It is equally, if not a more \"natural\n\nassumption,\"   that   Haggerty's    question    asking    if     anyone   was\n\navailable referred to the availability of commercial salvors, who\n\nroutinely carry pumps aboard their ships.            Most important, this\n\nCourt must view all facts in favor of the nonmoving party.                Any\n\n\"natural assumptions,\" therefore, must be viewed in a light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiffs.       Keeping this in mind, it is clear\n\nthat there is enough evidence of detrimental reliance to warrant a\n\nremand on that issue as well.\n\n          B.   The delay argument\n\n          By   dissecting   the    record,     the    majority    drew    two\n\n\n     29\n      Congress has expressed concerns that the Coast Guard --\nacting as a private salvor -- may unduly interfere with commercial\nsalvage efforts. Such concerns led Congress, in 1982 legislation,\nto direct the Coast Guard to \"review Coast Guard policies and\nprocedures for towing and salvage of disabled vessels in order to\nfurther minimize the possibility of Coast Guard competition or\ninterference with private towing activities or other commercial\nenterprise.\" Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1982, Pub. L. No.\n97-322 § 113, 96 Stat. 1581 (1982).\n\n                                   -67-\n\fconclusions: first, the Coast Guard delayed Goodridge by, at most,\n\ntwelve minutes; and second, twelve minutes is not a significant\n\ndelay.   Both conclusions are wrong.\n\n           At 9:03 a.m., Goodridge called Station Gloucester to\n\ninform them that he had equipment and was available to assist in\n\nthe salvage efforts.       The Coast Guard responded that \"they were\n\nbusy and they were going to handle it . . . they didn't need any\n\nhelp.\" After being rebuffed by the Coast Guard, Goodridge returned\n\nto work and gathered his gear to prepare to salvage a boat that had\n\nsunk that morning.        Goodridge continued to listen to his radio\n\ntransmitting the communications regarding the NORTHERN VOYAGER.\n\nAfter further listening, Goodridge concluded that, despite what the\n\nCoast Guard had said, the NORTHERN VOYAGER would need his help.\n\nThus, at 9:15 a.m., Goodridge called Cape Ann Divers to inquire who\n\nwould be there to assist in a dive and to gather information.              At\n\n9:33 a.m. Goodridge called Station Gloucester again and informed\n\nthem that he was coming with equipment.               At this point, the\n\nmajority   is   correct    that,   at   most,   the   Coast   Guard   delayed\n\nGoodridge by twelve minutes.       But, the Coast Guard caused further\n\ndelay once Goodridge arrived at his boat.         Using the radio onboard\n\nhis boat, Goodridge attempted to contact the Coast Guard to ask if\n\n\"we should take the time to load pumps or just come with the dive\n\ngear.\" The Coast Guard responded: \"don't tie up the channel; we're\n\n\n\n\n                                    -68-\n\fbusy; don't tie up the channel.\"30          Since the Coast Guard did not\n\nrespond, Goodridge \"took the time\" to \"run the pumps down the\n\ndock.\"     It is unclear how much extra time this took, but viewing\n\nthe evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs, it is\n\nenough evidence to require a remand on this issue.                   This is\n\nespecially true considering that the repairs required by the\n\nNORTHERN    VOYAGER   would   have   taken    \"two   minutes   or   less\"   to\n\ncomplete31 and did not even require the use of additional pumps.\n\n            Further, even if it is assumed that Goodridge was delayed\n\nby only twelve minutes, viewing the evidence in a light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiff, it can be concluded that the delay was\n\nsignificant.32    Had the delay not occurred, Goodridge could have\n\narrived at the scene in time to communicate with Captain Haggerty.\n\nAt such time, further efforts could have been taken to save the\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER.     This issue should also be remanded since the\n\n\n\n     30\n       Goodridge originally radioed the Coast Guard on channel 16\nand, as is customary, told the Coast Guard to switch to Channel 22,\nthe channel where the NORTHERN VOYAGER communications were taking\nplace.    After switching to Channel 22, the Coast Guard asked\nGoodridge to switch to Channel 12. Upon doing so, Goodridge was\ntold not to \"tie up\" this non-emergency channel, despite the fact\nthat Channel 12 did not contain any emergency communications\nbetween the Coast Guard and the NORTHERN VOYAGER. Thus, in effect,\nthe Coast Guard silenced and isolated Goodridge's salvage attempts.\n     31\n      The evidence showed that all a diver had to do was plug the\nrudder shaft, a simple and quick maneuver.\n     32\n      This evidence should also be viewed in light of the fact that\nthe NORTHERN VOYAGER was afloat for about one hour after the master\nwas forced to abandon it and to cease efforts to save it.\n\n                                     -69-\n\fdelay could have led to the demise of the NORTHERN VOYAGER.\n\n          III. Conclusion\n\n          Most   respectfully,    I     strongly   disagree   with   the\n\nmajority's holding that the Coast Guard has the power to remove a\n\nmaster of a vessel from his ship by threat of force, thereby\n\npreventing him from saving it.    My views are not some romantic or\n\narchaic notion to the effect that the \"captain should go down with\n\nthe ship,\"33 or a claim based on John Stuart Mill-like theories of\n\npersonal liberty and autonomy,34 although some might find such\n\narguments appealing.    Rather, they are based on the hard realities\n\nof the law of the sea as it has existed from time immemorial until\n\nthis case ensued.      The majority's unprecedented holding is not\n\nsupported by law, practice or maritime tradition.       It contradicts\n\nlegislative enactments and the very purpose of the discretionary\n\nfunction exception. Congress has never granted the Coast Guard the\n\nauthority to force a master to abandon his vessel.      Neither should\n\nthis Court.\n\n\n     33\n      Although such a tradition, which has not been altogether\nfanciful at different times, has served to establish a benchmark\nfor the commitment expected of a ship's captain toward his ship,\ncrew and passengers.\n     34\n      See John Stuart Mill, On Liberty 14 (John Gray ed., Oxford\nUniv.
