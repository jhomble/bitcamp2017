Defendant-appellant  Benito Filimon\n                     \n\nJiminian pled  guilty to  one count  of possession  of heroin\n\nwith  intent to  distribute  it,  see  21  U.S.C.  841(a)(1),\n                                     \n\n841(b)(1)(c), 846, and  one related conspiracy count,  see 18\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.   2.  The district court determined that Jiminian is a\n\ncareer offender under the Sentencing Guidelines and sentenced\n\nhim accordingly.  Jiminian  challenges his sentence, claiming\n\nthat  he  was  improperly classified  as  a  career offender.\n\nAppellant  also argues  that  the  district  court  erred  in\n\nrefusing  his request  for  a  downward  departure  from  the\n\napplicable guideline  range on  the basis  that his  criminal\n\nhistory  category  over-represented  the  seriousness of  his\n\ncriminal history.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n          The district  court adjudicated  Jiminian a  career\n\noffender on the basis of two prior state drug convictions for\n\npossession   of  cocaine  with   intent  to   distribute  it.\n\nAppellant argues  that these convictions  could not  properly\n\ncount as predicate offenses because the Sentencing Commission\n\nexceeded it statutory authority  when it designated  offenses\n\nunder  state  drug  laws as  qualifying  offenses  for career\n\noffender status.   In particular, Jiminian contends  that the\n\nenabling  statute, 28  U.S.C.     924(h),  allows  only  drug\n\nconvictions   obtained   under   the   federal  statutes   it\n\nenumerates--not  convictions  obtained  under  similar  state\n\n                             -2-\n\nstatutes---to  count   as  predicate   offenses.     We  have\n\npreviously  rejected this argument  and are not  persuaded to\n\nrevisit the  issue here.   See United States v.  Beasley, No.\n                                                        \n\n93-1391, slip op.  at 6-12 (1st Cir. December  21, 1993); see\n                                                             \n\nalso United States  v. Dyer, No. 93-1045, slip op.  at 2 (1st\n                           \n\nCir. June 18, 1993) (per curiam).\n\n          Appellant also argues that the district court erred\n\nin failing to inquire  into the facts surrounding the  latter\n\nof the two  state drug  convictions to  determine whether  it\n\nindeed  qualified   as   a  predicate   offense.     Although\n\nappellant's argument  is not  entirely clear,  he appears  to\n\ncontend that if the district court had made further  inquiry,\n\nit would  have ascertained  that the  evidence in  this state\n\ncase  was only  sufficient  to support  a  finding of  simple\n\npossession  of cocaine  for personal  use and  not  intent to\n\ndistribute  it.1   Appellant,  however,  conceded  below that\n\nthis offense  was a predicate offense under \"a strict reading\n\nof the  sentencing guidelines.\"   Accordingly,  the issue  is\n\nwaived on appeal.  See United  States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707,\n                                              \n\n717  (1st  Cir. 1992)  (claims  not  raised  at the  time  of\n\nsentencing are waived  on appeal), cert.  denied, 113 S.  Ct.\n                                                \n\n1005   (1993).    We  further  note  that  since  appellant's\n\n                    \n\n1.  Pursuant  to U.S.S.G.     4B1.1, 4B1.2, a  conviction for\npossession  of   a  controlled   substance  with  intent   to\ndistribute it--but  not  simple possession  of  a  controlled\nsubstance--is a predicate offense for career offender status.\n\n                             -3-\n\nconviction in the state case  at issue resulted from a guilty\n\nplea, he  admitted guilt to  the charged offense.  See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nAcevedo-Ramos v. United States, 961 F.2d 305, 308 (1st Cir.),\n                              \n\ncert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 299 (1992).2\n            \n\n                             II.\n\n          Appellant's remaining claimed error  is the failure\n\nof the district court to depart downward  from the applicable\n\nguideline  range.    We have  often  stated  that  a district\n\ncourt's  discretionary  decision  not  to   depart  from  the\n\nguidelines  is unappealable unless the decision is a \"product\n\nof  the court's miscalculation about whether it possessed the\n\nauthority to depart.\"  United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288,\n                                              \n\n292  (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S.  Ct. 224 (1992).  Here,\n                             \n\nthe record is clear that the district court recognized it had\n\nthe  authority to depart  from the guidelines,  but exercised\n\nits  discretion  not to  do  so.    Accordingly, we  have  no\n\njurisdiction to review appellant's claim.  The judgment below\n\nis affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\n                 \n\n                    \n\n2.  We  also find that  appellant waived any  issue regarding\nthe voluntariness of the guilty plea.  We make no  comment on\nwhether the constitutionality of  the state conviction  would\nhave  been open  to collateral  attack at  sentencing if  the\nissue had been raised below.\n\n                             -4-\n",
