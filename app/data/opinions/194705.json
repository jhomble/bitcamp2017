We  find no  abuse  of discretion  in the\n                \n\ndistrict  court's  dismissal  of  the  instant  complaint  as\n\n\"frivolous\"  under 28 U.S.C.   1915(d).  See, e.g., Denton v.\n                                                          \n\nHernandez, 112 S. Ct. 1728,  1734 (1992) (  1915(d) dismissal\n         \n\nproperly  reviewed  for  abuse  of  discretion);  Neitzke  v.\n                                                         \n\nWilliams, 490 U.S.  319, 325 (1989)  (complaint is  frivolous\n        \n\n\"where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact\");\n\nWatson v.  Caton, 984 F.2d 537,  539 (1st Cir. 1993).   It is\n                \n\nuncontested that  defendant, upon determining that  it lacked\n\njurisdiction   over   the  matter,   transferred  plaintiff's\n\ncomplaint to the EEOC.   Plaintiff has provided no  reason to\n\nsuggest  that  these   actions  were  other   than  in   full\n\nconformance  with applicable  law.   See, e.g.,  29 C.F.R.   \n                                              \n\n1691.5 (1992).  And even if it were otherwise, we perceive no\n\narguable  basis for  subjecting defendant  to liability  as a\n\nresult of any improprieties in its processing of  plaintiff's\n\ncomplaint.  See, e.g., Francis-Sobel v. University of  Maine,\n                                                            \n\n597  F.2d 15, 18  (1st Cir.)  (EEOC's alleged  mishandling of\n\ngrievance did  not  \"support  the  implication  of  a  damage\n\nremedy\"), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 949 (1979); see also Johnson\n                                                             \n\nv.
