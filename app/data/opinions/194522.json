This  appeal arises  from a\n                                   \n\nchallenge to the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority's (\"MBTA\" or\n\n\"Authority\") Guidelines for  Noncommercial Expressive Activity on\n\nMBTA  Property.   Plaintiffs  Jews  for Jesus  and  an individual\n\nmember of the organization contend that the Guidelines improperly\n\nrestrict  their First  Amendment  right  of  free  speech.    The\n\ndistrict court agreed and invalidated the offending provisions of\n\nthe  Guidelines.    The  MBTA  then  appealed.    We  affirm  the\n\ninvalidation  of  the  complete  ban on  expressive  activity  in\n\ndesignated  areas  but  reverse  the invalidation  of  the  prior\n\nauthorization requirement.\n\n                                I.\n\n     The defendant MBTA is  a municipal corporation that operates\n\nthe  subway system serving  the metropolitan Boston  region.  The\n\nsubway  system  contains  80 train  stations.    Each  station is\n\ndivided into two sections, the \"free\" area outside the turnstiles\n\nand the \"paid\" area inside the turnstiles, leading to the trains.\n\n     The  Authority promulgated  a  set of  Guidelines to  govern\n\nnoncommercial  expressive activity  in  the subway  system.   The\n\nGuidelines define such activity as:\n\n     [c]onducting  any  of   the  following  activities  for\n     political or non-profit purposes  as defined by G.L. c.\n     180,     4  and G.L.  c.  55,     1:   solicitation  of\n     signatures;   distribution    of   printed   materials;\n     handshaking  or greeting individual  transit patrons or\n     members of the  public; or publicly  addressing transit\n     patrons at a noise level greater than 85 decibels.\n\nThe Guidelines  ban  noncommercial expressive  activity from  the\n\npaid areas  of all  the subway  stations  and the  free areas  of\n\ntwelve  stations.1    Within  the  free  areas  of  the remaining\n\nstations, the Guidelines require prior authorization to engage in\n\nnoncommercial expressive activity.\n\n     Plaintiff Jews  for  Jesus is  a not-for-profit  corporation\n\nthat conducts  religious activity.   Plaintiff Steven Silverstein\n\nis the  branch leader of  the Boston  office of  Jews for  Jesus.\n\nPlaintiffs'   evangelistic   activity   consists   primarily   of\n\ndistributing  free religious  literature in  public places.   For\n\nmany  years  prior  to  the   commencement  of  this  suit,  they\n\ndistributed materials  throughout the  paid areas of  the transit\n\nsystem.2  \n\n     When  the MBTA  began  to prohibit  leafletting in  the paid\n\nareas, plaintiffs  mounted a facial challenge  to the Guidelines.\n\nTheir primary contention is  that the Guidelines impose a  ban on\n\nleafletting, a  form of protected speech,  without justification.\n\nThe  Authority counters  that  the regulations  are a  reasonable\n\ninfringement  of  First Amendment  rights  and  are necessary  to\n\npreserve  the system's transportation  function.   In particular,\n\n                    \n\n     1    The  twelve stations  are Science Park,  North Station,\nGovernment  Center,  Park  Street,  Boylston,  Copley  (Inbound),\nPrudential,  State  Street  (Northbound), Charles  Street,  Savin\nHill, Symphony, and  Kenmore.  The MBTA considers  these stations\nto lack  sufficient space to permit  any noncommercial expressive\nactivity.\n\n     2    The  previous  Guidelines for  Political,  Religious or\nEducational Activity prohibited  leafletting on  only the  subway\ntrains.    By   the  commencement  of  this   lawsuit,  the  MBTA\ninterpreted these guidelines as banning leafletting from the paid\nareas  as well and sought  to eject plaintiffs  from its stations\nfor violating the ban.  The current Guidelines were adopted after\nthis suit began.\n\n                               -3-\n\nthe  MBTA points to  a concern for  public safety to  justify the\n\nrestriction on leafletting.   \n\n     Plaintiffs do not contest the legitimacy of public safety as\n\na government concern.  Instead, the parties dispute the extent to\n\nwhich plaintiffs'  activities may  threaten public safety.   Jews\n                                                                 \n\nfor  Jesus, Inc. v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 783 F. Supp.\n                                                   \n\n1500, 1503 n.3 (D. Mass. 1991).  \n\n     Following a consolidated preliminary injunction  hearing and\n\ntrial on  the merits, the  district court concluded  that neither\n\nhandshaking and greeting nor  leafletting in fact threaten public\n\nsafety  in  the Boston  subway  system.   Id. at  1503.   Without\n                                            \n\ninvestigating solicitation  of signatures or  public address, the\n\ncourt nevertheless  invalidated  the  ban  on  all  noncommercial\n\nexpressive  activities  because  of  the   regulation's  sweeping\n\nrestriction  of protected speech.  In so doing, the court applied\n\na tenet of overbreadth  doctrine that permits facial invalidation\n\nof  a regulation whose reach beyond properly prohibited speech is\n\n\"substantial.\"  Broadrick v. Oklahoma,  413 U.S. 601, 615 (1973).\n                                     \n\nThe court  also invalidated  the authorization requirement  as an\n\nimpermissible prior restraint that  did not promote public safety\n\nconcerns.  \n\n     The court  left intact the Guidelines'  provisions regarding\n\nexpressive activity in areas where such activity  was not banned.\n\nThese  regulations  protect  public  safety by  establishing  the\n\nstandards of conduct for the performance of permitted activity as\n\nwell as the penalty for violation of the restrictions.  \n\n                               -4-\n\n                               -5-\n\n                               II.\n\n     On appeal, the MBTA contends that the district court applied\n\nan  erroneous  standard to  invalidate the  Guideline provisions.\n\nOur review, therefore, necessarily is, in many respects, de novo.\n                                                                \n\nSenter v. General Motors Corp., 532 F.2d 511 (6th Cir. 1976); see\n                                                                 \n\nSweeney  v. Bd.  of  Trustees, 604  F.2d 106,  109 n.2  (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1979).   The  district  court's factual  findings concerning  the\n\noperation  of  and  the  activities  within  the  subway  system,\n\nhowever, are reviewed only  for clear error.  Holmes  v. Bateson,\n                                                                \n\n583 F.2d 542, 552 (1st Cir. 1978).  Our examination of the record\n\ndemonstrates that the court's  findings are amply supported, and,\n\naccordingly, we adopt them for our analysis.  \n\n     A.  Ban on Noncommercial Expressive Activities\n                                                   \n\n     The  district  court  struck  down the  Authority's  ban  on\n\nnoncommercial expressive activities for  sweeping too broadly and\n\nbeing, in fact, unrelated to the  MBTA's legitimate public safety\n\nconcerns.   In reviewing  the court's decision,  we are concerned\n\nnot so much with  the technical use of the  overbreadth doctrine,\n\nwhich often  is confined to  the ability  of a party  engaging in\n\nunprotected  activity  to  raise   the  rights  of  others  whose\n\nactivities are protected, City  Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent,\n                                                                \n\n466 U.S. 789, 798 (1984), as with  the underlying analysis of the\n\ncourt that the MBTA did not justify the imposition of an absolute\n\nban. \n\n     The MBTA recommends that  we analyze the Guidelines pursuant\n\nto the public forum doctrine.  Forum analysis strikes the balance\n\n                               -6-\n\nbetween  the  public's right  of  access to  public  property for\n\nexpressive activity and the government's interest in limiting the\n\nproperty's use based on  the character of the property  at issue.\n\nPerry Educ. Ass'n v.  Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460  U.S. 37,\n                                                  \n\n44 (1983).  Fewer content-based restrictions are permissible in a\n\npublic forum,  a location either traditionally  or by designation\n\nopen to public discourse,  than in a nonpublic forum,  a location\n\ntraditionally  closed to  such discourse.   Id.  at 45.   As  the\n                                              \n\nSupreme Court has explained: \n\n     [D]istinctions in access on the basis of subject matter\n     and  speaker identity . .  . may be  impermissible in a\n     public forum  but are  inherent and inescapable  in the\n     process  of limiting  a nonpublic  forum to  activities\n     compatible with  the intended purpose  of the property.\n     The touchstone  for  evaluating these  distinctions  is\n     whether  they are  reasonable in  light of  the purpose\n     which the forum at issue serves.\n\nId. at 49.   Applying this  framework, the MBTA asserts  that the\n  \n\nalleged  historical unavailability  of  the subway  stations  for\n\npublic  discourse  renders  them  nonpublic  fora  and  that  the\n\nGuidelines are a reasonable regulation within this context.\n\n     The  nature of  the forum,  however, traditionally  has been\n\nimportant  only  when the  government  tries  to restrict  access\n\naccording  to the content of the message.   In any kind of forum,\n\nthe  government may impose  certain restrictions so  long as they\n\nare not based on the content of the speech.  Id. at 45.  \n                                               \n\n     We find  it unnecessary to decide whether  the Boston subway\n\nstations  are  public  or   nonpublic  fora  because  the  MBTA's\n\nGuidelines are  content neutral.   First, they restrict  only the\n\nmode of expression, not the message.   Second, they are aimed  at\n\n                               -7-\n\nlegitimate  government  concerns.    \"A  regulation  that  serves\n\npurposes  unrelated  to  the  content  of  expression  is  deemed\n\nneutral, even if it has an incidental effect  on some speakers or\n\nmessages  but not others.\"  Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n781, 109  S. Ct. 2746, 2754  (1989).  Accordingly, we  assess the\n\nactivities  ban as  a  content neutral  regulation.   See  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 110 S. Ct. 3118, 3125-26 (1990)\n                  \n\n(Kennedy, J., concurring) (rejecting  use of forum analysis where\n\ncontent neutral, reasonable time, place, and manner evaluation is\n\navailable).\n\n     A  content  neutral  restriction  may  limit  speech  if  it\n\nreasonably regulates  the time,  place, and manner  of expression\n\nand  is  tailored  narrowly  to serve  a  substantial  government\n\ninterest.  Perry Educ. Ass'n, 460 U.S. at 45-46.  Our review thus\n                            \n\nfocuses on  two critical  inquiries:  \"whether  [the Authority's]\n\ninterest is sufficiently substantial to justify the effect of the\n\nordinance on [plaintiffs'] expression, and whether that effect is\n\nno  greater  than  necessary  to  accomplish   the  [Authority's]\n\npurpose.\"  City Council, 466 U.S.  at 805; Shad v. Mount Ephraim,\n                                                                \n\n452 U.S. 61, 71 (1981).  \n\n     We  realize that in recent decisions,  the Supreme Court has\n\napplied the nonpublic forum standard of reasonableness to content\n\nneutral  restrictions on free  speech.  See,  e.g., Int'l Society\n                                                                 \n\nfor  Krishna Consciousness,  Inc. (\"ISKCON\")  v. Lee, 112  S.

Traditionally,\n                          \n\nhowever,  the Court has employed the reasonableness test only for\n\n                               -8-\n\ncontent-based  restrictions  in  nonpublic   fora.    See,  e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nCornelius v. NAACP  Legal Defense  &amp; Educ. Fund,  Inc., 473  U.S.\n                                                      \n\n788,  809 (1985)  (applying reasonableness  test to  exclusion of\n\npolitical advocacy  organizations  from charity  drive  aimed  at\n\nfederal employees); Perry Educ. Ass'n,  460 U.S. at 49  (applying\n                                     \n\nsame test to exclusion from school mail network based on identity\n\nof proposed  speaker); and Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828, 831, 839\n                                         \n\n(1976)  (applying same  test to  exclusion of  partisan political\n\nspeech  from  military  base).   Regardless,  because  that  test\n\nrequires the challenged regulations to be reasonable in light  of\n\nthe forum's purpose and the surrounding circumstances, see, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nISKCON, 112 S. Ct. at 2705,  the two tests merge or collapse into\n      \n\none another in cases where, as here, the government has failed to\n\npresent a credible reason why the regulations further the forum's\n\npurpose.  We now consider each form of activity in turn.3 \n\n1.  Leafletting\n               \n\n     The Authority contends that its concern for passenger safety\n\njustifies the  ban on  leafletting.   It argues  that leafletting\n\nthreatens  public  safety by  disrupting  passenger  flow and  by\n\ncreating  litter.   In  particular,  it  claims that  leafletting\n\ncauses obstacles  that, inter  alia, encourage pickpocketing  and\n                                   \n\nmore  adversely  affect handicapped  patrons  who  are slower  to\n\nadjust to  obstacles.   It  further contends  that litter  causes\n\naccidents and  fires or other  disruptions in service  when paper\n\n                    \n\n     3    On  appeal, the  Authority  concedes  that the  blanket\nrestriction against greeting and handshaking is unreasonable.  We\ntherefore consider only the remaining restricted activities.\n\n                               -9-\n\nclogs switching devices on the tracks.  Public safety, of course,\n\nis  a  substantial  government  concern  that  can  justify  some\n\nincidental infringement of protected speech.  ISKCON, 112  S. Ct.\n                                                    \n\nat 2708-09.\n\n     We   are  mindful  that  \"[a]  ban  on  handbilling  .  .  .\n\nsuppress[es] a great quantity  of speech that does not  cause the\n\nevils that it seeks to eliminate.\"  Ward, 109 S. Ct. at  2758 n.7\n                                        \n\n(citing Martin  v.  City  of  Struthers,  319  U.S.  141,  147-49\n                                       \n\n(1943)).  The Authority  thus bears a heavy burden  in justifying\n\nits  absolute ban  on  leafletting,  an  activity that  long  has\n\nenjoyed  the full protection of  the First Amendment.   Lovell v.\n                                                              \n\nCity  of Griffin,  303  U.S. 444,  450-52  (1938).   Indeed,  the\n                \n\nreligious  nature of plaintiffs' leafletting increases the MBTA's\n\nburden;  leafletting  is a  \"form  of  religious activity  [that]\n\noccupies the same  high estate  under the First  Amendment as  do\n\nworship  in churches and preaching from the pulpits.\"  Murdock v.\n                                                              \n\nPennsylvania,  319 U.S. 105, 108-09  (1943).  The  record in this\n            \n\ncase amply  supports the district court's  determination that the\n\nperceived threat to public safety does not justify a complete ban\n\non leafletting in the designated areas.\n\n     The  Supreme  Court  has  dismissed the  danger  to  traffic\n\ncongestion  as a justification to ban leafletting.  The Court has\n\nexplained  that  \"`[t]he  distribution  of  literature  does  not\n\nrequire that the recipient  stop in order to receive  the message\n\nthe  speaker wishes to  convey.'\"  ISKCON, 112  S. Ct. at 2713-14\n                                         \n\n(O'Connor, J., concurring) (quoting Kokinda, 110 S. Ct. at 3123).\n                                           \n\n                               -10-\n\nBottlenecks,  therefore,  are  unlikely   to  develop.    Because\n\nleafletting is a particularly unobtrusive form of expression, the\n\nCourt recently  invalidated a ban  on leafletting, even  within a\n\nnonpublic forum.   Lee v.  ISKCON, 112 S.  Ct. 2709, 2709  (1992)\n                                 \n\n(per curiam); see ISKCON, 112 S.  Ct. at 2708 (finding airport to\n                        \n\nbe nonpublic forum).\n\n     The Authority  next contends that leafletting causes litter-\n\nrelated hazards.  The Supreme Court, however, long has recognized\n\nthat littering is the fault of the litterbug, not the leafletter.\n\nSchneider  v.  State, 308  U.S. 147,  162  (1939).   The normally\n                    \n\nappropriate response to problems  caused by litter, therefore, is\n\nto punish the litterbug.  \n\n     The record,  moreover,  does  not  support  the  Authority's\n\nfears.  Over a period of 18 months,  the Authority's accident and\n\nincident  report listed more than  250 accidents, but  it did not\n\nindicate  the  type  or cause  of  any  of  the reported  events.\n\nDefendant's  Trial  Exhibit 23A.    These  numbers  alone do  not\n\nsupport  generalizations  that  noncommercial leafletting  causes\n\naccidents.     Besides,  in  accordance   with  the   Guidelines,\n\nplaintiffs regularly  pick up  leaflets that have  been discarded\n\nimproperly by  transit patrons.   Indeed, the MBTA  employees who\n\ntestified  at trial  did not  know of  any accidents,  crimes, or\n\nother  incidents  in  which   plaintiffs  were  implicated.    We\n\ntherefore  affirm  the district  court's  determination  that the\n\nevidence   did  not  demonstrate   a  causal  connection  between\n\nleafletting and litter-related safety problems.  \n\n                               -11-\n\n     The record reveals a myriad of other nontransit activity  in\n\nthe  stations  that further  weakens  the  justification for  the\n\nleafletting  ban.   See Grayned  v. Rockford,  408 U.S.  104, 116\n                                            \n\n(1972)  (holding that crux of time, place, and manner analysis is\n\n\"whether  the   manner  of  [banned]   expression  is   basically\n\nincompatible  with the normal activity of a particular place at a\n\nparticular  time\").  Passengers bring in paper and food items for\n\nimmediate  consumption.   Vendors, including  wandering newspaper\n\nhawkers, sell  newspapers, magazines, food, and  drink within the\n\nstations.     Businesses  leave  promotional  flyers  unattended.\n\nMusicians set  up portable stations  to perform, sell  tapes, and\n\nsolicit contributions.   The  MBTA deliberately has  invited into\n\nthe  subway  system a  range  of expressive  activities  that can\n\nproduce problems similar to  those it attributes to leafletting.4\n\nThe  condoned presence  of  these activities  indicates that  the\n\nsubway system can accommodate  peaceful leafletting.  See ISKCON,\n                                                                \n\n112 S. Ct.  at 2713-14 (O'Connor, J., concurring)  (striking down\n\nban on  leafletting where activity reasonably  is compatible with\n\n\"shopping mall\"  environment of  airport).   We  thus affirm  the\n\ndistrict  court's conclusion  that  litter does  not justify  the\n\ncomplete ban on leafletting.  \n\n2.  Solicitation of Signatures\n                              \n\n                    \n\n     4    As Edward Manning, the Superintendent of the Light Rail\nDepartment, testified, passengers  \"can slip  easily on  anything\n                                                                 \nthat  would be  discarded on  the platform.\"  Tr. Vol.  I at  64.\n(emphasis added).  Indeed,  Daniel Breen, the Building Structures\nDivision Engineer, stated his  opinion that concession stands and\nnewspaper  vendors also should be banned because of the \"mess and\nthe safety problems\" they cause.  Tr. Vol. I at 43, 49.\n\n                               -12-\n\n     Although  the   parties  did   not  discuss  this   form  of\n\nexpression, we  realize that the  Supreme Court has  accorded the\n\nsolicitation  of  signatures  for   petitions  a  high  level  of\n\nprotection  because it \"involves both  the expression of a desire\n\nfor  political change  and  a discussion  of  the merits  of  the\n\nproposed change.\"  Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 421, 425 (1988).\n                                 \n\nIt  therefore  \"involves  the type  of  interactive communication\n\nconcerning political  change that  is appropriately  described as\n\n`core  political speech.'\"  Id. at 421-22.  When restricting this\n                              \n\nkind  of speech, the government bears a greater burden to justify\n\nits ban.   Id. at  425; see also  Burson v.  Freeman, 112 S.  Ct.\n                                                    \n\n1846, 1857  (1992) (warning  that ban against  electioneering can\n\nbecome \"an impermissible  burden\" the farther  from the polls  it\n\nextends).  \n\n     Yet  the  MBTA  has  offered  no  support  for  its  ban  on\n\nsolicitation  of  signatures.    The argument  and  the  evidence\n\npresented focus solely on  the dangers to public safety  posed by\n\nleafletting.   Because we do not see how peaceful solicitation of\n\nsignatures  clashes  with  the  multipurpose  environment  of the\n\nsubway  system,  we  \"cannot accept  that  a  total  ban on  that\n\nactivity  is reasonable without an  explanation as to  why such a\n\nrestriction `preserve[s]  the property'  for the several  uses to\n\nwhich it  has been put.\"   ISKCON, 112 S. Ct.  at 2714 (O'Connor,\n                                 \n\nJ., concurring) (quoting Perry Educ. Ass'n, 460 U.S. at 50-51).  \n                                          \n\n     Even extending the Authority's  concern for public safety to\n\nsolicitation,  we are not persuaded that the inferred risks would\n\n                               -13-\n\njustify  the   ban  on   solicitation  of  signatures.     First,\n\nsolicitation  of  signatures  does   not  produce  litter.    The\n\nsolicitor does not give the  petition to a passenger to keep  but\n\nis careful to  hold on to  every page of  the petition.   Second,\n\nbecause  no money  changes  hands, the  risk  of fraud,  a  major\n\nconcern justifying  bans on solicitation of funds, ISKCON, 112 S.\n                                                         \n\nCt. at 2708,  is absent.   Third, although  solicitation is  more\n\ndisruptive  of passenger flow  because it invites  a passenger to\n\nstop  to read  the petition  before deciding  whether to  add her\n\nname, it is no  more disruptive of traffic than  other activities\n\nin the transit  system.  Both the  hawking of newspapers and  the\n\nplaying  of  music  create  crowds  as  passengers  stop  to  buy\n\nnewspapers,  listen  to a  performance,  or make  donations  to a\n\nmusician.  In the absence of contrary evidence from the MBTA, the\n\npeaceful solicitation  of signatures appears compatible  with the\n\nenvironment of the Boston subway system.\n\n3.  Public Address\n                  \n\n     Finally, we  turn our  attention to  the ban  against public\n\naddress.   As  with solicitation, we  conclude that  the complete\n\nlack of an explanation and evidence to support the ban  on public\n\naddress compels its invalidation.   The Authority confines public\n\naddress  in  the free  areas  to  decibel levels  below  95.   It\n\nevidently has  determined  that 95  decibels is  the level  above\n\nwhich public safety is  endangered.  In any  event, the MBTA  has\n\nnot explained why,  in light  of this  available and  uncontested\n\nrestriction, the absolute ban is necessary.\n\n                               -14-\n\n4.  Other Guideline Provisions\n                              \n\n     The Authority, of course, may tailor the Guidelines narrowly\n\nto  achieve  its  interest  in  public  safety.     For  example,\n\nplaintiffs concede that the  MBTA legitimately may ban expressive\n\nactivity during especially crowded peak hours when the dangers to\n\nthe public are greater.  \n\n     Ironically,  the Guidelines  already contain  narrowly drawn\n\ntime,  place, and  manner  restrictions that  satisfy the  MBTA's\n\nspecific  concerns.   The  Guidelines  forbid littering,  leaving\n\nliterature  unattended, and  interfering with  the safety  of the\n\npassengers or the operation  of the subway trains.   In addition,\n\nto minimize the risk  of accidents, the MBTA maintains  a 15-foot\n\nsafety zone around elevators, stairwells, kiosks, turnstiles, the\n\nedge of any train platform,  and other high risk structures.   It\n\nalso  bans expressive activity from areas less than 15 feet wide.\n\nThe Guidelines authorize the ejectment of any person who violates\n\nthese prohibitions.   Finally, the MBTA  may cancel authorization\n\nof noncommercial  expressive activity for a  reasonable time when\n\npublic  safety or the operation of the transit system so require.\n\nParticularly   with   unchallenged   time,   place,   and  manner\n\nregulations  in place  to protect  the Authority's  interest, the\n\ncomplete  ban on  noncommercial expressive  activity in  the paid\n\nareas and free areas of earmarked stations cannot stand.\n\n     We add that we are not unaware of the special conditions and\n\ndangers of subway  operation.   We are, however,  dealing with  a\n\ncontinuing  injunction.    Thus,  to  the  extent  that  existing\n\n                               -15-\n\nregulations  prove  inadequate,  the   Authority  may  adopt,  if\n\njustified, appropriately tailored regulations going  beyond those\n\nwe have  sustained, if and  when the evidence,  including changed\n\nconditions, warrants such restrictions.\n\n     B.  Prior Authorization Requirement\n                                        \n\n     The  Guidelines  require a  person  to obtain  authorization\n\nbefore engaging in noncommercial  expressive activity.  To obtain\n\nauthorization, a person must telephone the Authority and indicate\n\nfor  whom   the  authorization   is  requested,  the   number  of\n\nindividuals  involved,  and  the  proposed  location,  time,  and\n\nactivity.    When  a  person receives  permission  to  engage  in\n\nnoncommercial expressive  activity, she also  receives a  control\n\nnumber.    The Authority  charts  the number  on  the appropriate\n\nstation diagram and transmits the  information to the station  so\n\nthat the personnel there  can oversee the activity.   The request\n\nline is available 15 and 1/2 hours each day, seven days a week.  \n\n     The district court  voided the authorization requirement  as\n\nan unconstitutional prior restraint.   It explained that the MBTA\n\ncould not require  a license  to engage in  ordinary speech  like\n\nhandshaking  or greeting  and that the  authorization requirement\n\ndid not promote the Authority's avowed interests in public safety\n\nand evenhanded access  to the subway stations for First Amendment\n\nactivities.    We  disagree  with the  court's  conclusions  and,\n\ntherefore,   reverse  the   invalidation  of   the  authorization\n\nrequirement.  \n\n                               -16-\n\n     Although  it   is  true  that  a   regulation  allowing  the\n\ngovernment  to deny  use of  its property  \"in advance  of actual\n\nexpression\" is a  prior restraint, Southeastern Promotions,  Ltd.\n                                                                 \n\nv.

A prior restraint\n                                    \n\nsystem is permissible if  it contains certain safeguards designed\n\nto protect against  censorship.  Freedman  v. Maryland, 380  U.S.\n                                                      \n\n51,  58-60 (1965).  Where the prior restraint is content neutral,\n\nthe regulations must limit the time for issuing authorization and\n\nmust permit prompt  judicial review.   Id., construed in  FW/PBS,\n                                                                 \n\nInc. v. City of Dallas, 110 S. Ct. 596, 606-07 (1990).\n                      \n\n     The Guidelines satisfactorily incorporate  these safeguards.\n\nThe Authority responds to  each request at the  time it is  made.\n\nThe  Guidelines  further  delineate   the  situations  in   which\n\nauthorization  may  be  denied:   when  the  desired  location is\n\nunavailable; when  the planned activity endangers  public safety;\n\nand when the  planned activity  constitutes prohibited  conduct.5\n\nThe  applicant may  appeal  a denial  of  authorization, and  the\n\nfiling  of  an  appeal entitles  the  claimant  to  a hearing  in\n\naccordance with Mass. Regs. Code tit. 801,   1.02.\n\n     Given these safeguards, it is more appropriate to scrutinize\n\nthe permit  system  as  a time,  place,  and  manner  regulation.\n\n                    \n\n     5    Prohibited   conduct  includes   unlicensed  commercial\nactivity,  distribution  of  food  and drink,  posting  bills  or\notherwise  affixing materials  to an  MBTA structure,  setting up\ntables or  portable equipment,  carrying large placards  or signs\naffixed  to a pole, discarding or  leaving unattended any printed\nmaterial,  and producing or  amplifying sound to  a level greater\nthan 95 decibels.\n\n                               -17-\n\nHeffron,  452  U.S.  at  647  n.10,  649.      The  authorization\n       \n\nrequirement is  \"not open  to the  kind of  arbitrary application\n\nthat [the Supreme Court] has condemned as inherently inconsistent\n\nwith  a valid  time, place,  and manner  regulation  because such\n\ndiscretion has the potential for becoming a  means of suppressing\n\na particular point  of view.\"  Id. at 649.   Like the regulations\n                                 \n\nupheld  in Heffron, id., the Guidelines allocate space on a first\n                      \n\ncome,  first  served  basis,   without  regard  to  the  messages\n\npresented.    The  Authority  does not  even  inquire  about  the\n\ncontents of the message.\n\n     As we noted above, a content neutral time, place, and manner\n\nregulation  passes  constitutional  muster  if  it  is   tailored\n\nnarrowly  to serve a significant government interest.  As part of\n\nthis inquiry, we also  consider whether the regulation forecloses\n\nalternative channels  of communication.   Perry Educ.  Ass'n, 460\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  at 45-46.   The  authorization requirement  satisfies these\n\nstrictures.\n\n     The   Guidelines   leave   available   ample   channels   of\n\ncommunication   for  plaintiffs'   message.      Plaintiffs   may\n\ndisseminate their  leaflets in the streets,  parks, and sidewalks\n\nadjacent  to the train stations.   Within the  transit system, if\n\nplaintiffs  are denied  authorization in  one location,  they may\n\nseek to use a different one or to reserve a different time.  \n\n     The   Authority  asserts   that  the   government  interests\n\nprotected  through the authorization requirement include ensuring\n\npublic  safety and  equal access  for all who  wish to  engage in\n\n                               -18-\n\nnoncommercial  expressive activity.    In  particular, the  prior\n\nauthorization enables  the Authority to arrange  necessary police\n\ncoverage, an undeniably substantial  government interest.  Cox v.\n                                                              \n\nNew Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569, 576 (1941).\n             \n\n     The question remains whether the prior authorization  scheme\n\nis  tailored  narrowly  to  advance  the  Authority's  legitimate\n\ninterests.  The district court answered this question negatively.\n\nIt  reasoned  that  advance  warning  for  police  deployment  is\n\nunnecessary  for  a  lone  leafletter  and  that,  for  a  larger\n\ngathering, the Guidelines do not provide sufficient lead time  to\n\nredeploy  the  Authority's  security  forces.     This  reasoning\n\noverlooks  the fact that \"the requirement  of narrow tailoring is\n\nsatisfied `so long as the . . . regulation promotes a substantial\n\ngovernment  interest that  would  be  achieved  less  effectively\n\nabsent  the  regulation.'\"   Ward, 109  S.  Ct. at  2758 (quoting\n                                 \n\nUnited  States  v.  Albertini, 472  U.S.  675,  689 (1985));  see\n                                                                 \n\nCornelius, 473 U.S. at 808.\n         \n\n     The  authorization scheme  effectively  promotes the  MBTA's\n\ninterests.   With  respect to the  lone leafletter,  the district\n\ncourt  did not  take into  account the  cumulative effect  that a\n\nnumber of  lone leafletters converging  on the  same station  can\n\nhave  on public  safety.   The authorization  scheme  enables the\n\nAuthority  to   avoid   scheduling  conflicts   among   different\n\napplicants and to contain  the amount of activity at a level that\n\ndoes not interfere with public safety.  \n\n                               -19-\n\n     The requirement  also copes with the  problems attending the\n\nstaging  of a large  rally or gathering.   In such  an event, the\n\nAuthority  reasonably could deny permission because  of a risk to\n\npublic  safety, if it does  not have adequate  time to deploy its\n\npersonnel.    The  Authority,  moreover, boasts  the  ability  to\n\nredeploy its personnel quickly  because it maintains a number  of\n\npolice officers throughout the  system, who can be diverted  to a\n\nstation on  short radio  notice.  The  authorization scheme  thus\n\nenables the MBTA  to monitor the  activity in the  system at  any\n\ntime so that it can prevent and respond to problems affecting the\n\npublic.     These   benefits   are  sufficient   to  uphold   the\n\nauthorization requirement.  See Cox, 312 U.S. at 576.\n                                   \n\n                               III.\n\n     To summarize,  we  affirm the  invalidation  of the  ban  on\n\nnoncommercial  expressive  activity  from  designated  areas  and\n\nreverse the invalidation of  the prior authorization requirement.\n\nSolicitation of signatures, leafletting, handshaking or greeting,\n\nand public address all may  occur within the paid and  free areas\n\nof  the transit  stations in accordance  with the  existing time,\n\nplace,  and manner  restrictions (e.g., requiring  leafletters to\n                                      \n\nstay 15 feet away from the platform's edge) and the authorization\n\nrequirement.  These  provisions now  apply to the  paid areas  as\n\nwell as to the free areas.  If the distance restrictions preclude\n\nactivity in any of the free or paid areas, a complete ban on  all\n\nnoncommercial expressive activity may apply to the affected area.\n\n                               -20-\n\n     Affirmed in part and reversed in part.

This  appeal arises  from a\n                                   \n\nchallenge to the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority's (\"MBTA\" or\n\n\"Authority\") Guidelines for  Noncommercial Expressive Activity on\n\nMBTA  Property.   Plaintiffs  Jews  for Jesus  and  an individual\n\nmember of the organization contend that the Guidelines improperly\n\nrestrict  their First  Amendment  right  of  free  speech.    The\n\ndistrict court agreed and invalidated the offending provisions of\n\nthe  Guidelines.    The  MBTA  then  appealed.    We  affirm  the\n\ninvalidation  of  the  complete  ban on  expressive  activity  in\n\ndesignated  areas  but  reverse  the invalidation  of  the  prior\n\nauthorization requirement.\n\n                                I.\n\n     The defendant MBTA is  a municipal corporation that operates\n\nthe  subway system serving  the metropolitan Boston  region.  The\n\nsubway  system  contains  80 train  stations.    Each  station is\n\ndivided into two sections, the \"free\" area outside the turnstiles\n\nand the \"paid\" area inside the turnstiles, leading to the trains.\n\n     The  Authority promulgated  a  set of  Guidelines to  govern\n\nnoncommercial  expressive activity  in  the subway  system.   The\n\nGuidelines define such activity as:\n\n     [c]onducting  any  of   the  following  activities  for\n     political or non-profit purposes  as defined by G.L. c.\n     180,     4  and G.L.  c.  55,     1:   solicitation  of\n     signatures;   distribution    of   printed   materials;\n     handshaking  or greeting individual  transit patrons or\n     members of the  public; or publicly  addressing transit\n     patrons at a noise level greater than 85 decibels.\n\nThe Guidelines  ban  noncommercial expressive  activity from  the\n\npaid areas  of all  the subway  stations  and the  free areas  of\n\ntwelve  stations.1    Within  the  free  areas  of  the remaining\n\nstations, the Guidelines require prior authorization to engage in\n\nnoncommercial expressive activity.\n\n     Plaintiff Jews  for  Jesus is  a not-for-profit  corporation\n\nthat conducts  religious activity.   Plaintiff Steven Silverstein\n\nis the  branch leader of  the Boston  office of  Jews for  Jesus.\n\nPlaintiffs'   evangelistic   activity   consists   primarily   of\n\ndistributing  free religious  literature in  public places.   For\n\nmany  years  prior  to  the   commencement  of  this  suit,  they\n\ndistributed materials  throughout the  paid areas of  the transit\n\nsystem.2  \n\n     When  the MBTA  began  to prohibit  leafletting in  the paid\n\nareas, plaintiffs  mounted a facial challenge  to the Guidelines.\n\nTheir primary contention is  that the Guidelines impose a  ban on\n\nleafletting, a  form of protected speech,  without justification.\n\nThe  Authority counters  that  the regulations  are a  reasonable\n\ninfringement  of  First Amendment  rights  and  are necessary  to\n\npreserve  the system's transportation  function.   In particular,\n\n                    \n\n     1    The  twelve stations  are Science Park,  North Station,\nGovernment  Center,  Park  Street,  Boylston,  Copley  (Inbound),\nPrudential,  State  Street  (Northbound), Charles  Street,  Savin\nHill, Symphony, and  Kenmore.  The MBTA considers  these stations\nto lack  sufficient space to permit  any noncommercial expressive\nactivity.\n\n     2    The  previous  Guidelines for  Political,  Religious or\nEducational Activity prohibited  leafletting on  only the  subway\ntrains.    By   the  commencement  of  this   lawsuit,  the  MBTA\ninterpreted these guidelines as banning leafletting from the paid\nareas  as well and sought  to eject plaintiffs  from its stations\nfor violating the ban.  The current Guidelines were adopted after\nthis suit began.\n\n                               -3-\n\nthe  MBTA points to  a concern for  public safety to  justify the\n\nrestriction on leafletting.   \n\n     Plaintiffs do not contest the legitimacy of public safety as\n\na government concern.  Instead, the parties dispute the extent to\n\nwhich plaintiffs'  activities may  threaten public safety.   Jews\n                                                                 \n\nfor  Jesus, Inc. v. Massachusetts Bay Transp.

Without\n                                            \n\ninvestigating solicitation  of signatures or  public address, the\n\ncourt nevertheless  invalidated  the  ban  on  all  noncommercial\n\nexpressive  activities  because  of  the   regulation's  sweeping\n\nrestriction  of protected speech.

Our examination of the record\n\ndemonstrates that the court's  findings are amply supported, and,\n\naccordingly, we adopt them for our analysis.  \n\n     A.

In reviewing  the court's decision,  we are concerned\n\nnot so much with  the technical use of the  overbreadth doctrine,\n\nwhich often  is confined to  the ability  of a party  engaging in\n\nunprotected  activity  to  raise   the  rights  of  others  whose\n\nactivities are protected, City  Council v.

Forum analysis strikes the balance\n\n                               -6-\n\nbetween  the  public's right  of  access to  public  property for\n\nexpressive activity and the government's interest in limiting the\n\nproperty's use based on  the character of the property  at issue.\n\nPerry Educ.

Fewer content-based restrictions are permissible in a\n\npublic forum,  a location either traditionally  or by designation\n\nopen to public discourse,  than in a nonpublic forum,  a location\n\ntraditionally  closed to  such discourse.   Id.  at 45.   As  the\n                                              \n\nSupreme Court has explained: \n\n     [D]istinctions in access on the basis of subject matter\n     and  speaker identity . .  . may be  impermissible in a\n     public forum  but are  inherent and inescapable  in the\n     process  of limiting  a nonpublic  forum to  activities\n     compatible with  the intended purpose  of the property.\n     The touchstone  for  evaluating these  distinctions  is\n     whether  they are  reasonable in  light of  the purpose\n     which the forum at issue serves.\n\nId. at 49.   Applying this  framework, the MBTA asserts  that the\n  \n\nalleged  historical unavailability  of  the subway  stations  for\n\npublic  discourse  renders  them  nonpublic  fora  and  that  the\n\nGuidelines are a reasonable regulation within this context.\n\n     The  nature of  the forum,  however, traditionally  has been\n\nimportant  only  when the  government  tries  to restrict  access\n\naccording  to the content of the message.   In any kind of forum,\n\nthe  government may impose  certain restrictions so  long as they\n\nare not based on the content of the speech.

First, they restrict  only the\n\nmode of expression, not the message.

The  record in this\n            \n\ncase amply  supports the district court's  determination that the\n\nperceived threat to public safety does not justify a complete ban\n\non leafletting in the designated areas.\n\n     The  Supreme  Court  has  dismissed the  danger  to  traffic\n\ncongestion  as a justification to ban leafletting.  The Court has\n\nexplained  that  \"`[t]he  distribution  of  literature  does  not\n\nrequire that the recipient  stop in order to receive  the message\n\nthe  speaker wishes to  convey.'\"  ISKCON, 112  S.

The normally\n                    \n\nappropriate response to problems  caused by litter, therefore, is\n\nto punish the litterbug.  \n\n     The record,  moreover,  does  not  support  the  Authority's\n\nfears.  Over a period of 18 months,  the Authority's accident and\n\nincident  report listed more than  250 accidents, but  it did not\n\nindicate  the  type  or cause  of  any  of  the reported  events.\n\nDefendant's  Trial  Exhibit 23A.    These  numbers  alone do  not\n\nsupport  generalizations  that  noncommercial leafletting  causes\n\naccidents.     Besides,  in  accordance   with  the   Guidelines,\n\nplaintiffs regularly  pick up  leaflets that have  been discarded\n\nimproperly by  transit patrons.   Indeed, the MBTA  employees who\n\ntestified  at trial  did not  know of  any accidents,  crimes, or\n\nother  incidents  in  which   plaintiffs  were  implicated.    We\n\ntherefore  affirm  the district  court's  determination  that the\n\nevidence   did  not  demonstrate   a  causal  connection  between\n\nleafletting and litter-related safety problems.  \n\n                               -11-\n\n     The record reveals a myriad of other nontransit activity  in\n\nthe  stations  that further  weakens  the  justification for  the\n\nleafletting  ban.

The  MBTA deliberately has  invited into\n\nthe  subway  system a  range  of expressive  activities  that can\n\nproduce problems similar to  those it attributes to leafletting.4\n\nThe  condoned presence  of  these activities  indicates that  the\n\nsubway system can accommodate  peaceful leafletting.

When restricting this\n                              \n\nkind  of speech, the government bears a greater burden to justify\n\nits ban.   Id. at  425; see also  Burson v.  Freeman, 112 S.  Ct.\n                                                    \n\n1846, 1857  (1992) (warning  that ban against  electioneering can\n\nbecome \"an impermissible  burden\" the farther  from the polls  it\n\nextends).  \n\n     Yet  the  MBTA  has  offered  no  support  for  its  ban  on\n\nsolicitation  of  signatures.    The argument  and  the  evidence\n\npresented focus solely on  the dangers to public safety  posed by\n\nleafletting.   Because we do not see how peaceful solicitation of\n\nsignatures  clashes  with  the  multipurpose  environment  of the\n\nsubway  system,  we  \"cannot accept  that  a  total  ban on  that\n\nactivity  is reasonable without an  explanation as to  why such a\n\nrestriction `preserve[s]  the property'  for the several  uses to\n\nwhich it  has been put.\"   ISKCON, 112 S. Ct.  at 2714 (O'Connor,\n                                 \n\nJ., concurring) (quoting Perry Educ. Ass'n, 460 U.S. at 50-51).  \n                                          \n\n     Even extending the Authority's  concern for public safety to\n\nsolicitation,  we are not persuaded that the inferred risks would\n\n                               -13-\n\njustify  the   ban  on   solicitation  of  signatures.     First,\n\nsolicitation  of  signatures  does   not  produce  litter.    The\n\nsolicitor does not give the  petition to a passenger to keep  but\n\nis careful to  hold on to  every page of  the petition.   Second,\n\nbecause  no money  changes  hands, the  risk  of fraud,  a  major\n\nconcern justifying  bans on solicitation of funds, ISKCON, 112 S.\n                                                         \n\nCt. at 2708,  is absent.   Third, although  solicitation is  more\n\ndisruptive  of passenger flow  because it invites  a passenger to\n\nstop  to read  the petition  before deciding  whether to  add her\n\nname, it is no  more disruptive of traffic than  other activities\n\nin the transit  system.  Both the  hawking of newspapers and  the\n\nplaying  of  music  create  crowds  as  passengers  stop  to  buy\n\nnewspapers,  listen  to a  performance,  or make  donations  to a\n\nmusician.  In the absence of contrary evidence from the MBTA, the\n\npeaceful solicitation  of signatures appears compatible  with the\n\nenvironment of the Boston subway system.\n\n3.  Public Address\n                  \n\n     Finally, we  turn our  attention to  the ban  against public\n\naddress.   As  with solicitation, we  conclude that  the complete\n\nlack of an explanation and evidence to support the ban  on public\n\naddress compels its invalidation.   The Authority confines public\n\naddress  in  the free  areas  to  decibel levels  below  95.   It\n\nevidently has  determined  that 95  decibels is  the level  above\n\nwhich public safety is  endangered.  In any  event, the MBTA  has\n\nnot explained why,  in light  of this  available and  uncontested\n\nrestriction, the absolute ban is necessary.\n\n                               -14-\n\n4.  Other Guideline Provisions\n                              \n\n     The Authority, of course, may tailor the Guidelines narrowly\n\nto  achieve  its  interest  in  public  safety.     For  example,\n\nplaintiffs concede that the  MBTA legitimately may ban expressive\n\nactivity during especially crowded peak hours when the dangers to\n\nthe public are greater.  \n\n     Ironically,  the Guidelines  already contain  narrowly drawn\n\ntime,  place, and  manner  restrictions that  satisfy the  MBTA's\n\nspecific  concerns.   The  Guidelines  forbid littering,  leaving\n\nliterature  unattended, and  interfering with  the safety  of the\n\npassengers or the operation  of the subway trains.   In addition,\n\nto minimize the risk  of accidents, the MBTA maintains  a 15-foot\n\nsafety zone around elevators, stairwells, kiosks, turnstiles, the\n\nedge of any train platform,  and other high risk structures.   It\n\nalso  bans expressive activity from areas less than 15 feet wide.\n\nThe Guidelines authorize the ejectment of any person who violates\n\nthese prohibitions.   Finally, the MBTA  may cancel authorization\n\nof noncommercial  expressive activity for a  reasonable time when\n\npublic  safety or the operation of the transit system so require.\n\nParticularly   with   unchallenged   time,   place,   and  manner\n\nregulations  in place  to protect  the Authority's  interest, the\n\ncomplete  ban on  noncommercial expressive  activity in  the paid\n\nareas and free areas of earmarked stations cannot stand.\n\n     We add that we are not unaware of the special conditions and\n\ndangers of subway  operation.   We are, however,  dealing with  a\n\ncontinuing  injunction.    Thus,  to  the  extent  that  existing\n\n                               -15-\n\nregulations  prove  inadequate,  the   Authority  may  adopt,  if\n\njustified, appropriately tailored regulations going  beyond those\n\nwe have  sustained, if and  when the evidence,  including changed\n\nconditions, warrants such restrictions.\n\n     B.  Prior Authorization Requirement\n                                        \n\n     The  Guidelines  require a  person  to obtain  authorization\n\nbefore engaging in noncommercial  expressive activity.  To obtain\n\nauthorization, a person must telephone the Authority and indicate\n\nfor  whom   the  authorization   is  requested,  the   number  of\n\nindividuals  involved,  and  the  proposed  location,  time,  and\n\nactivity.    When  a  person receives  permission  to  engage  in\n\nnoncommercial expressive  activity, she also  receives a  control\n\nnumber.    The Authority  charts  the number  on  the appropriate\n\nstation diagram and transmits the  information to the station  so\n\nthat the personnel there  can oversee the activity.   The request\n\nline is available 15 and 1/2 hours each day, seven days a week.  \n\n     The district court  voided the authorization requirement  as\n\nan unconstitutional prior restraint.   It explained that the MBTA\n\ncould not require  a license  to engage in  ordinary speech  like\n\nhandshaking  or greeting  and that the  authorization requirement\n\ndid not promote the Authority's avowed interests in public safety\n\nand evenhanded access  to the subway stations for First Amendment\n\nactivities.    We  disagree  with the  court's  conclusions  and,\n\ntherefore,   reverse  the   invalidation  of   the  authorization\n\nrequirement.  \n\n                               -16-\n\n     Although  it   is  true  that  a   regulation  allowing  the\n\ngovernment  to deny  use of  its property  \"in advance  of actual\n\nexpression\" is a  prior restraint, Southeastern Promotions,  Ltd.\n                                                                 \n\nv.

Like the regulations\n                                 \n\nupheld  in Heffron, id., the Guidelines allocate space on a first\n                      \n\ncome,  first  served  basis,   without  regard  to  the  messages\n\npresented.    The  Authority  does not  even  inquire  about  the\n\ncontents of the message.\n\n     As we noted above, a content neutral time, place, and manner\n\nregulation  passes  constitutional  muster  if  it  is   tailored\n\nnarrowly  to serve a significant government interest.  As part of\n\nthis inquiry, we also  consider whether the regulation forecloses\n\nalternative channels  of communication.   Perry Educ.  Ass'n, 460\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  at 45-46.   The  authorization requirement  satisfies these\n\nstrictures.\n\n     The   Guidelines   leave   available   ample   channels   of\n\ncommunication   for  plaintiffs'   message.      Plaintiffs   may\n\ndisseminate their  leaflets in the streets,  parks, and sidewalks\n\nadjacent  to the train stations.   Within the  transit system, if\n\nplaintiffs  are denied  authorization in  one location,  they may\n\nseek to use a different one or to reserve a different time.  \n\n     The   Authority  asserts   that  the   government  interests\n\nprotected  through the authorization requirement include ensuring\n\npublic  safety and  equal access  for all who  wish to  engage in\n\n                               -18-\n\nnoncommercial  expressive activity.

The district court answered this question negatively.\n\nIt  reasoned  that  advance  warning  for  police  deployment  is\n\nunnecessary  for  a  lone  leafletter  and  that,  for  a  larger\n\ngathering, the Guidelines do not provide sufficient lead time  to\n\nredeploy  the  Authority's  security  forces.     This  reasoning\n\noverlooks  the fact that \"the requirement  of narrow tailoring is\n\nsatisfied `so long as the . . . regulation promotes a substantial\n\ngovernment  interest that  would  be  achieved  less  effectively\n\nabsent  the  regulation.'\"   Ward, 109  S.  Ct. at  2758 (quoting\n                                 \n\nUnited  States  v.  Albertini, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111487\"><a href=\"/opinion/111487/united-states-v-albertini/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  689 (1985));  see\n                                                                 \n\nCornelius, 473 U.S. at 808.\n         \n\n     The  authorization scheme  effectively  promotes the  MBTA's\n\ninterests.   With  respect to the  lone leafletter,  the district\n\ncourt  did not  take into  account the  cumulative effect  that a\n\nnumber of  lone leafletters converging  on the  same station  can\n\nhave  on public  safety.   The authorization  scheme  enables the\n\nAuthority  to   avoid   scheduling  conflicts   among   different\n\napplicants and to contain  the amount of activity at a level that\n\ndoes not interfere with public safety.  \n\n                               -19-\n\n     The requirement  also copes with the  problems attending the\n\nstaging  of a large  rally or gathering.   In such  an event, the\n\nAuthority  reasonably could deny permission because  of a risk to\n\npublic  safety, if it does  not have adequate  time to deploy its\n\npersonnel.    The  Authority,  moreover, boasts  the  ability  to\n\nredeploy its personnel quickly  because it maintains a number  of\n\npolice officers throughout the  system, who can be diverted  to a\n\nstation on  short radio  notice.  The  authorization scheme  thus\n\nenables the MBTA  to monitor the  activity in the  system at  any\n\ntime so that it can prevent and respond to problems affecting the\n\npublic.     These   benefits   are  sufficient   to  uphold   the\n\nauthorization requirement.  See Cox, 312 U.S. at 576.\n                                   \n\n                               III.\n\n     To summarize,  we  affirm the  invalidation  of the  ban  on\n\nnoncommercial  expressive  activity  from  designated  areas  and\n\nreverse the invalidation of  the prior authorization requirement.\n\nSolicitation of signatures, leafletting, handshaking or greeting,\n\nand public address all may  occur within the paid and  free areas\n\nof  the transit  stations in accordance  with the  existing time,\n\nplace,  and manner  restrictions (e.g., requiring  leafletters to\n                                      \n\nstay 15 feet away from the platform's edge) and the authorization\n\nrequirement.  These  provisions now  apply to the  paid areas  as\n\nwell as to the free areas.  If the distance restrictions preclude\n\nactivity in any of the free or paid areas, a complete ban on  all\n\nnoncommercial expressive activity may apply to the affected area.\n\n                               -20-\n\n     Affirmed in part and reversed in part.  No costs. \n                                                     \n\n                               -21-\n</pre>",
