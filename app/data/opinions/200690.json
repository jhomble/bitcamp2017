Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n          Torruella, Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jennifer Goldstein on brief pro se.\n     Michael R. Byrne, John F. Rooney, III and Melick, Porter &\nShea, LLP on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 14, 2003\n\f     Per Curiam.     This appeal arises from a pro se lawsuit filed in\n\nNovember 1999 by Jennifer Goldstein against Harvard University\n\nalleging violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities\n\nAct (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12182, in connection with Goldstein's\n\nforced withdrawal from a Ph.D. program in the Department of Romance\n\nLanguages and Literatures following her failure to take a general\n\nexamination in August 1993, the end of her fifth year of graduate\n\nstudy.    Goldstein's complaint alleged two theories under the ADA:\n\n(a) Harvard discriminated against her on the basis of a perceived\n\nmental disability (depression) by subjecting her to a more rigorous\n\nexamination schedule than it applied to other students; and (b)\n\nHarvard   failed    to   accommodate   her   actual   physical    disability\n\n(asthma) by rescheduling the exam outside of \"asthma season.\"\n\n     The district court granted summary judgment on the grounds\n\nthat Goldstein's lawsuit was initiated outside the three-year\n\nstatute of limitations,1 and, in the alternative, Harvard was\n\nentitled to summary judgment on the merits. The court subsequently\n\ndenied Goldstein's motion to amend judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n59(e).    Goldstein challenges the grant of summary judgment in\n\nHarvard's favor and the denial of her Rule 59(e) motion.            She also\n\nchallenges    the    denial   of   a   motion   to    compel     answers   to\n\n\n     1\n      Since the ADA does not contain a statute of limitations,\ncourts borrow the most analogous state statute of limitations.\nSee, e.g., Gaona v. Town & Country Credit, 324 F.3d 1050, 1055-56\n(8th Cir. 2003). In the instant case, the district court borrowed\nMassachusetts' three-year statute of limitations for personal\ninjuries, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A.      Goldstein makes no\nargument that this was error.\n\finterrogatories seeking the names of graduate students permitted to\n\nenter their sixth year of graduate study without having passed the\n\ngeneral examination.   For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\n     Summary judgment is proper \"if the pleadings, depositions,\n\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\n\nthe affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\n\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).   We review the\n\ngrant of summary judgment de novo, construing the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to Goldstein. See Stewart v. Dutra Const. Co.\n\nInc., 343 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 2003).   We may affirm the district\n\ncourt's decision on any sufficient ground revealed by the record.\n\nRodriquez v. Smithkline Beecham, 224 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n     Goldstein argues that her claim of discrimination based on a\n\nperceived (mental) disability is equitably tolled because, although\n\nshe knew in 1993 that certain Harvard faculty members viewed her as\n\n\"anxious,\" she did not learn that they believed her to suffer from\n\na mental problem rising to the level of a disability until March\n\n1997 when she first obtained a copy of a June 1993 letter written\n\nby her thesis advisor expressing concerns that Goldstein was\n\n\"seriously depressed\" and that she might be at risk to herself or\n\nothers.   To support this tolling argument, Goldstein moves to\n\nsupplement the record with a personal affidavit attesting to the\n\ndate of discovery of the June 1993 letter.\n\n     Goldstein failed to make this equitable tolling argument,\n\fhowever,    in   her    opposition    to   Harvard's     motion   for   summary\n\njudgment, and, thus, she has forfeited it.2              See, e.g., Landrau-\n\nRomero v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 212 F.3d 607, 612 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (refusing to consider equitable tolling argument that was not\n\nseasonably raised in district court).           Indeed, we think that the\n\ndistrict court could properly conclude that Goldstein abandoned her\n\nperceived   disability      theory   at    summary   judgment.      Under   the\n\ncircumstances, we need not address the request to supplement the\n\nrecord.    We add that, in any event, the evidence of record, viewed\n\nin the light most favorable to Goldstein, failed to create a\n\nmaterial issue of fact as to whether a perceived disability was the\n\nimpetus behind Harvard's adverse action.             Goldstein's examination\n\nschedule was set and she was told that she would not be allowed to\n\nregister in the fall without satisfying this requirement prior to\n\na meeting, referenced in the June 1993 letter, which prompted the\n\nadvisor's concerns.\n\n      Goldstein also makes various equitable tolling arguments with\n\nrespect to her claim that Harvard failed to accommodate her actual\n\ncondition of asthma, including an argument that the claim did not\n\naccrue until 1998 when the condition was first diagnosed.               We need\n\nnot reach these tolling arguments because the claim fails on the\n\nmerits essentially for the reasons stated by the district court.\n\nThe   operative        provision,    42    U.S.C.    §   12182(b)(2)(A)(ii),\n\n\n      2\n      Contrary to Goldstein's suggestion, we do not think that\nHarvard's motion for summary judgment was limited to her claim of\nfailure to accommodate an actual (physical) disability.\n\f\"require[s] a person with a disability to request a reasonable and\n\nnecessary modification, thereby informing the operator of a public\n\naccommodation about the disability.\"    Dudley v. Hannaford Bros.\n\nCo., 333 F.3d 299, 309 (1st Cir. 2003).     Goldstein's August 20,\n\n1993 letter does not meet this requirement.3\n\n     As for Goldstein's challenge to the discovery ruling, we\n\nobserve that \"[t]he management of pretrial discovery lies primarily\n\nwithin the sound discretion of the district court\" and \"[t]his\n\ncourt 'will intervene in such matters only upon a clear showing of\n\nmanifest injustice, that is where the lower court's discovery order\n\nwas plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the\n\naggrieved party.'\" United States Steel v. M. DeMatteo Constr. Co.,\n\n315 F.3d 43, 53 (1st Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted).\n\nGoldstein has not met this test.   We agree with the district court\n\nthat the discovery sought would not materially aid Goldstein's\n\n\n\n     3\n      Although the letter referred to an incident, two weeks\nearlier, in which Goldstein suffered from impaired vision, there\nwas no suggestion that the problem interfered with her ability to\ntake the examination, much less any information that would put\nHarvard on notice that she had a disability within the meaning of\nthe ADA that required accommodation.       Cf. Estades-Negrani v.\nAssocs. Corp. of North America, 2003 WL 22244952 at *5 (1st Cir.\n2003) (affirming grant of summary judgment under Title I of the ADA\nwhere plaintiff had not been diagnosed with a disability at the\ntime she sought a reduced workload or an assistant and employer did\nnot know she was disabled); Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d\n254, 260 (1st Cir. 2001) (affirming grant of summary judgment under\nTitle I of the ADA where, inter alia, plaintiff never adequately\nput employer on notice of her disability and need for\naccommodation); Wynne v. Tufts Univ. Sch. of Med., 976 F.2d 791,\n795 (1st Cir. 1997) (indicating that to be liable under the\nRehabilitation Act, a school must know or be reasonably expected to\nknow of student's handicap).\n\fclaim that Harvard failed reasonably to accommodate an actual\n\ndisability.      To the extent that the information sought might\n\nconceivably be relevant to Goldstein's perceived disability claim\n\n(and we do not decide this issue), she suffered no prejudice given\n\nthe forfeiture of her equitable tolling argument.\n\n     Goldstein makes no separate argument directed at the denial of\n\nher Rule 59(e) motion.   In any event, upon review of the record we\n\nfind no abuse of discretion.   See Rivera v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct &\n\nSewers Author., 331 F.3d 183, 192 (1st Cir. 2003) (abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard).    The motion essentially repeated arguments\n\nalready made in Goldstein's opposition.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\f",
