MARIE,\n\n                       Plaintiff, Appellee,\n\n                                v.\n\n                   ALLIED HOME MORTGAGE CORP.,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant,\n\n                         JOSEPH THOMPSON,\n\n                            Defendant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Diane M. Saunders, with whom Danielle Meagher, James M.\nPender, and Morgan, Brown & Joy, LLP, were on brief, for appellant.\n     Robert M. Mendillo, with whom Mendillo & Ross, LLP, was on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          March 16, 2005\n\f             LYNCH, Circuit Judge.           This case involving employment\n\narbitration agreements deals with important issues both for Title\n\nVII   law    and   for   the    division     of   labor     between   courts   and\n\narbitrators after the Supreme Court's decisions in Howsam v. Dean\n\nWitter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.S. 79 (2002), and Green Tree Fin.\n\nCorp. v. Bazzle, 539 U.S. 444 (2003).               The employee concedes that\n\nthe Title VII claims involved in this case are arbitrable.                     See\n\nRosenberg v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 170 F.3d\n\n1, 10 (1st Cir. 1999).         The key issue is whether an employer waives\n\nits contractual right to compel arbitration of a Title VII claim by\n\nnot filing for arbitration when the employee initiates an EEOC\n\ncomplaint,      but   instead     waiting     and    only    moving   to   compel\n\narbitration after the employee later files a civil claim in federal\n\ncourt.      We hold here that although the issue of compliance with a\n\ncontractual time limit should, in the first instance, be addressed\n\nby the arbitrator, the issue of waiver of the right to arbitrate\n\ndue to inconsistent activity in another litigation forum remains an\n\nissue for the court even after the Howsam and Green Tree holdings.\n\n             Moreover, on the merits, we hold that an employer does\n\nnot waive its right to arbitration by failing to demand arbitration\n\nduring the pendency of an EEOC investigation. This confirms in the\n\nlight of intervening Supreme Court cases a result this court had\n\nreached earlier on different reasoning.               See Brennan v. King, 139\n\nF.3d 258, 263-64 (1st Cir. 1998).            Our reasoning rests in part on\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fEEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279 (2002), which held that an\n\nemployer cannot preclude the EEOC from bringing an enforcement\n\naction   based   on    an   employee's       complaint    by   relying    on    an\n\narbitration clause between the employer and employee.              In light of\n\nWaffle House, a rule forcing the employer to file for arbitration\n\nduring   the   pendency     of   an   EEOC   investigation     would     lead   to\n\nwasteful, duplicative proceedings, and we reject such a result. We\n\nhold that the employer in this case has not waived its right to\n\narbitrate the claims at issue.              We reverse the decision of the\n\ndistrict court refusing to stay judicial proceedings and compel\n\narbitration, and remand.\n\n                                       I.\n\n           Allied Home Mortgage Corporation is a Texas corporation\n\nin the business of mortgage banking; it has a branch office in\n\nWoburn, Massachusetts.       Martha M. Marie began working for Allied's\n\nWoburn branch on November 1, 2000 as a mortgage loan processor.\n\nJoseph Thompson, a branch manager of Allied's Woburn branch, hired\n\nMarie and was her supervisor.         He was Marie's boyfriend at the time\n\nof her hiring.        She was to be compensated by receiving fifty\n\npercent of any loan origination fees on all loans she originated.\n\n           Marie alleges that Thompson used \"undue influence, verbal\n\nabuse, and threats of physical abuse\" to divert loan origination\n\ncredit from Marie to Thompson, to force Marie to engage in an\n\n\"autodialing\"    scheme     in   violation     of   The   Telephone      Consumer\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fProtection Act of 1991, 47 U.S.C. § 227, and to force Marie to pay\n\nfor office supplies out of her own pocket.               Marie alleges that\n\nAllied knew that some of her origination credit was being diverted\n\nfrom Marie to Thompson and did nothing.\n\n            Marie also alleges that Thompson threw her out of a\n\nstopped car in the winter of 2002 because he was angry with her\n\nwork.   Finally, she alleges that Thompson physically beat Marie in\n\nJune 2002 both because he was angry with her work and because he\n\nthought   she    was    having   a    sexual   affair   with    another   Allied\n\nemployee.    Marie alleges that Thompson wanted her to have sexual\n\nrelations solely with him.           Marie never returned to work after the\n\nbeating in June -- the company listed her termination date as June\n\n28, 2002. She claims that Allied falsely reported in its personnel\n\nrecords that she voluntarily quit her position.                  In July 2002,\n\nMarie   sought    and    obtained     an   Abuse   Prevention    Order    from   a\n\nMassachusetts state court requiring Thompson to stay away from her.\n\n            When Marie was hired by Allied on November 1, 2000, she\n\nsigned an employment contract that was also signed by Thompson as\n\nAllied's representative.         This four-page standard-form agreement\n\ncontained an arbitration clause in Article 5.1. The clause states:\n\n            Employer and Employee agree to submit to final\n            and binding arbitration any and all disputes,\n            claims (whether in tort, contract, statutory,\n            or otherwise), and disagreements concerning\n            the interpretation or application of this\n            Agreement   and   Employee's   employment   by\n            Employer and the termination of this Agreement\n            and   Employee's    employment   by   Employer\n\n                                        -4-\n\f           including the arbitrability of any such\n           controversy or claim . . . .    Arbitration\n           under this section must be initiated within\n           sixty days of the action, inaction, or\n           occurrence about which the party initiating\n           the arbitration is complaining.\n\nThe agreement also stated that any arbitration was to be conducted\n\nunder the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).\n\n           On April 23, 2003, Marie filed a charge of discrimination\n\nwith the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and with\n\nthe Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) against\n\nAllied and Thompson.       The charge alleged sexual discrimination in\n\nviolation of Title VII        of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and\n\napplicable state law.        The charge, in particular, alleged that\n\nduring Marie's employment with Allied, Thompson \"physically abused\n\n[her] and verbally abused [her] repeatedly because he thought [she]\n\nwas having a sexual affair with another employee, and Thompson\n\nwanted [her] to have sexual relations only with him.\"\n\n           Allied filed a response to this charge on May 22, 2003.\n\nThe EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Rights on July 18, 2003,\n\nstating that it had concluded its investigation without finding\n\nthat any violation of Title VII occurred.            It stated that the\n\nevidence   showed   that    Marie   and   Thompson   lived   together   and\n\nrepresented themselves as domestic partners; there was no evidence\n\nthat her \"consensual relationship\" with Thompson was \"unwelcome\" as\n\nrequired to be actionable under Title VII.              Also, Thompson's\n\nactions were motivated by his personal relationship, not by Marie's\n\n                                    -5-\n\fgender.   Finally, the dismissal noted that Marie did not utilize\n\nAllied's existing sexual harassment policy.       The dismissal stated\n\nthat Marie now had a right to sue Thompson or Allied for sexual\n\ndiscrimination in federal or state court.\n\n          On October 14, 2003, Marie filed a civil complaint in\n\nMassachusetts   Superior   Court,    naming   Allied   and   Thompson   as\n\ndefendants; an amended complaint was filed on November 6, 2003.\n\nThe amended complaint named both Allied and Thompson as defendants\n\nfor assault and battery and sexual harassment under Title VII of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, and named Allied for negligent\n\nsupervision of Thompson and for breach of contract and unjust\n\nenrichment.   Marie asked for money damages and attorney's fees and\n\ncosts under Title VII.\n\n          Thompson has never been served; Allied was served on\n\nNovember 20, 2003.   Allied removed the action to federal district\n\ncourt in Massachusetts on December 9, 2003. On December 22, Allied\n\nfiled a demand for arbitration with the AAA, within sixty days of\n\nbeing served.     On December 23, 2003, Allied moved to compel\n\narbitration and to stay the court proceedings; the motion was\n\nopposed by Marie.    This motion was denied on January 8, 2004 (the\n\norder was docketed on January 12, 2004), by order stating: \"It\n\nbeing undisputed that the initiation of arbitration proceedings\n\noccurred on December 22, 2003, more than sixty days after the\n\nconclusion of [the] charge proceedings before the [EEOC], the\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fdemand for arbitration is untimely under Article V of plaintiff's\n\nemployment agreement.\"\n\n           Allied did not appeal this order but instead, on January\n\n26, 2004, moved to dismiss Marie's complaint as untimely, or, in\n\nthe alternative, to reconsider the denial of the motion to compel\n\narbitration and stay proceedings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). This\n\nmotion was denied as to each alternative on February 18.          The court\n\nconsidered the contract to be one of adhesion and relied upon the\n\nrule that an \"ambiguous provision in an adhesion agreement will be\n\nstrictly construed against the party that wrote it.\"              The court\n\nalso stated that Allied's argument was based on the premise that\n\nMarie was required to initiate arbitration within sixty days of the\n\nconclusion of the EEOC proceedings if she wanted to pursue her\n\nclaims, while Allied had six years (the full limitation period for\n\ncontract actions under Massachusetts law) to demand arbitration.\n\nThis, the court stated, was inequitable and a \"breathtaking\"\n\nreading of the contract.        The court, citing Martin v. Norwood, 478\n\nN.E.2d 955, 957-58 (Mass. 1985), held that Allied, through its\n\ndelay, had \"waived\" its right to arbitrate the claims and thus the\n\nlawsuit would proceed.\n\n           The district court's January 12 and February 18 holdings\n\nrelied on two distinct theories for why arbitration should not be\n\ncompelled and litigation stayed: (1) Allied's purported failure to\n\ncomply   with   the   precise    60-day    time   limit   contained   in   the\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\farbitration    provision,      as   interpreted     by      the   court,     and   (2)\n\nAllied's waiver of its right to arbitrate due to unreasonable\n\ndelay.\n\n             Allied filed a notice of appeal to this court on March\n\n12, 2004.     The notice appealed the district court's February 18,\n\n2004 order, \"insofar as such [o]rder denied Allied's motion for\n\nreconsideration     of   the    denial    of     Allied's     motion    to    compel\n\narbitration.\"\n\n                                      II.\n\n             We first examine the complex issue of our jurisdiction in\n\nthis case; Marie argues there is none.\n\n             Ordinarily,    appeals      are    only     permitted     from    final\n\njudgments of the district court.               There are a limited number of\n\nexceptions.     See, e.g., Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v.\n\nMetcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 142-43 (1993).                 A few of these\n\nexceptions occur in the arbitration context, as stated in the\n\nFederal Arbitration Act (FAA).           See 9 U.S.C. § 16(a).         Appeal may\n\nbe   taken   from   an   interlocutory      order      of   the   district     court\n\n\"refusing a stay of any action\" pending arbitration or \"denying a\n\npetition . . . to order arbitration to proceed,\" although no appeal\n\nmay be taken from a district court's granting such a stay or\n\ngranting a motion to compel arbitration.1              Id. § 16(a)(1), (b).\n\n\n      1\n      We note that we have no jurisdiction over the motion to\ndismiss filed with Allied's motion for reconsideration on January\n26, 2004. Allied made no attempt to appeal this determination and,\n\n                                      -8-\n\f           In this case, Allied filed a motion with the district\n\ncourt to stay court proceedings and compel arbitration; both\n\nrequests were denied and these denials were immediately appealable.\n\nBut interlocutory appeals, like all other appeals, are governed by\n\nthe time limitations identified in Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).\n\nThis provision requires a party to file the notice of appeal within\n\n30 days \"after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\"\n\nId.   This timeliness requirement is jurisdictional.   See Griggs v.\n\nProvident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 61 (1982) (\"It is well\n\nsettled that the requirement of a timely notice of appeal is\n\n'mandatory and jurisdictional.'\" (quoting Browder v. Dir., Ill.\n\nDep't of Corr., 434 U.S. 257, 264 (1978))); see also Davignon v.\n\nClemmey, 322 F.3d 1, 10-11 (1st Cir. 2003) (timely notice of appeal\n\nrequirement is jurisdictional although it is not an Article III\n\nrequirement).\n\n           Rather than appealing immediately, Allied filed a motion\n\nfor reconsideration.   Allied argues that its filing a motion for\n\nreconsideration within ten days of the initial order tolled the\n\ntime for appeal until after the court's ruling on the motion for\n\n\n\nmore importantly, a denial of a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss is not\nan appealable interlocutory order. Marie argues that Allied has\nwaived review of the denial of the motion to compel arbitration and\nstay proceedings because its initial brief to this court only\ndiscussed the motion to dismiss and not the latter motion. This is\nuntrue: while Allied's initial brief did erroneously discuss the\norder denying the motion to dismiss, it also discussed the denial\nof the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.\n\n                                -9-\n\freconsideration.     Since an appeal was filed within thirty days of\n\nthe ruling on the motion for reconsideration, Allied argues that\n\nthe appeal is timely.\n\n          Allied's    position   is    correct.      Allied's   motion   for\n\nreconsideration stated that its basis was as a motion to alter or\n\namend the judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e); at any rate, we\n\nhave held that a motion for reconsideration should be construed as\n\na motion to alter or amend a judgment under Rule 59(e) where this\n\nis relevant for jurisdictional purposes.          See, e.g., United States\n\nv. $23,000 in U.S. Currency, 356 F.3d 157, 165 n.9 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\nYoung v. Gordon, 330 F.3d 76, 80 (1st Cir. 2003); In re Sun Pipe\n\nLine Co., 831 F.2d 22, 24 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"Notwithstanding that\n\n[appellant]   did   not   denominate     any   particular   rule   as    the\n\nspringboard for its reconsideration motion, it is settled in this\n\ncircuit that a motion which asked the court to modify its earlier\n\ndisposition of a case because of an allegedly erroneous legal\n\nresult is brought under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).\").           The motion for\n\nreconsideration filed here must be so construed.2\n\n\n     2\n      We note that it is very difficult to prevail on a Rule 59(e)\nmotion. The general rule in this circuit is that the moving party\nmust \"either clearly establish a manifest error of law or must\npresent newly discovered evidence.\" Pomerleau v. W. Springfield\nPub. Sch., 362 F.3d 143, 146 n.2 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting FDIC v.\nWorld Univ. Inc., 978 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 1992)); see also 11 C.\nWright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 2810.1 (2d ed. 1995)\n(noting four grounds for granting such a motion: manifest errors of\nlaw or fact, newly discovered or previously unavailable evidence,\nmanifest injustice, and an intervening change in controlling law).\nAs well, grants and denials of Rule 59(e) motions are reviewed only\n\n                                  -10-\n\f             The \"judgment\" that Allied asked the court to \"alter or\n\namend\" was the court's January 8, 2004 order denying Allied's\n\nmotion to stay proceedings and compel arbitration. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n59(e).    For purposes of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this\n\norder was a judgment because it was an \"order from which an appeal\n\nlies.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(a); see Abdulwali v. Wash. Metro. Area\n\nTransit Auth., 315 F.3d 302, 303-04 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (order denying\n\nsummary judgment based on sovereign immunity was \"judgment\" for\n\npurposes of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure);             Lichtenberg v.\n\nBesicorp Group Inc., 204 F.3d 397, 400-01 (2d Cir. 2000) (same with\n\nrespect    to   order   granting   a    preliminary   injunction);   Roque-\n\nRodriquez v. Lema Moya, 926 F.2d 103, 106 (1st Cir. 1991) (same\n\nwith respect to order denying summary judgment based on qualified\n\nimmunity).\n\n            The motion requesting that the January 8 order be altered\n\nor amended was timely filed within ten days of that order.3            Fed.\n\n\nfor abuse of discretion. See Venegas-Hernandez v. Sonolux Records,\n370 F.3d 183, 190 (1st Cir. 2004). Allied claimed to have brought\nits motion because of a manifest error of law made by the district\ncourt. Even though Allied may have had little chance of prevailing\non its Rule 59(e) motion, the motion still acted to toll the 30-day\nappeal period.\n     3\n      There was some question about this at oral argument; in\nresponse, Allied submitted a Rule 28(j) letter.    The order was\ndated January 8, 2004, but it was not entered on the docket until\nJanuary 12, 2004. The docketed date is the one used for purposes\nof computing filing deadlines. See Roque-Rodriguez, 926 F.2d at\n106.   The ten day limit is unquestionably met from this latter\ndate, given that the day the order is handed down, as well as\nintermediate weekends and holidays, are not included in the\n\n                                       -11-\n\fR. Civ. P. 59(e).        Under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A), certain\n\nmotions, if timely filed, can toll the thirty-day appeal period.\n\nA motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment\n\nappears on this list.      Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv).            A timely\n\nmotion to alter or amend a \"judgment\" that is an appealable\n\ninterlocutory order tolls the time for filing a notice of appeal.\n\nSee Lichtenberg, 204 F.3d at 400-01; Roque-Rodriguez, 926 F.2d at\n\n106-07; Denley v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 733 F.2d 39, 41 (6th\n\nCir. 1984).    The thirty-day clock restarts after the order denying\n\nthe motion to alter or amend the judgment.                  Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(a)(4)(A).     This order was handed down on February 18, 2004;\n\nAllied filed its notice of appeal on March 12, 2004.           The notice of\n\nappeal   was   thus   timely   as   to   the   underlying    motion   to   stay\n\nproceedings or compel arbitration.4\n\n\ncalculation.    See id. at 106 n.5, 107.\n     4\n      Any motion for reconsideration filed after the ten day period\ndoes not toll the time period for appealing the underlying order\nthat the party is asking to be reconsidered.            See, e.g.,\nLichtenberg, 204 F.3d at 401.\n     As well, at least absent some newly available evidence, law,\nor a new stage of the proceedings, orders denying such motions for\nreconsideration of an appealable interlocutory order are generally\nnot themselves appealable.     See, e.g., Fisichelli v. Town of\nMethuen, 884 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1989) (no appellate jurisdiction\nover motion to reconsider, raising no newly available facts or\narguments, filed one and a half years after denial of original\nmotion for qualified immunity); Cozza v. Network Assocs., Inc., 362\nF.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2004) (leaving open question of whether\nappeals   court   would   have   jurisdiction   over   motion   for\nreconsideration of order denying stay of proceedings and compelling\narbitration based on newly available evidence); see also Behrens v.\nPelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 306-07 (1996) (allowing appeals of orders\n\n                                    -12-\n\f          Marie argues that, even granting all of this, Allied did\n\nnot attempt to appeal the underlying motion to stay proceedings or\n\ncompel arbitration, but only the order denying reconsideration,\n\nbecause its notice of appeal named only the latter order.        It is\n\ntrue that the notice of appeal named only the order denying\n\nAllied's motion for reconsideration as being appealed, and Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 3(c)(1)(B) states that a party should \"designate the\n\njudgment, order, or part thereof being appealed.\"     As well, a Rule\n\n59(e) motion is separate from the underlying judgment for purposes\n\nof appeal.   Correa v. Cruisers, 298 F.3d 13, 21 n.3 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n          However,   when   determining   what   is   actually   being\n\nappealed, we have been liberal. See Chamorro v. Puerto Rican Cars,\n\nInc., 304 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 2002).    We look to the appellant's\n\nintent on the record as a whole and at whether the appellee has\n\nbeen misled by the appellant's unclear notice. See Foman v. Davis,\n\n\ndenying qualified immunity both at motion to dismiss stage and at\nsummary judgment stage); Oblix, Inc. v. Winiecki, 374 F.3d 488, 490\n(7th Cir. 2004) (allowing jurisdiction over motion to reconsider\nfiled more than ten days after order denying motion to compel\narbitration, where judge invited reconsideration in order to\nconsider new case law).        Such a denial of a motion for\nreconsideration is not another denial on the merits of the\nimmediately appealable underlying motion.     The Fisichelli court\nstressed that this rule was \"virtually essential to orderly\njudicial management,\" since interlocutory motions to reconsider are\nnot in the Federal Rules and therefore can be brought at any point\nin a proceeding, and as many times as a movant wishes. Fisichelli,\n884 F.2d at 19. \"[A] dilatory defendant would receive not only his\nallotted bite at the apple, but an invitation to gnaw at will.\"\nId.\n\n                                -13-\n\f371 U.S. 178, 181-82 (1962) (\"It is . . . entirely contrary to the\n\nspirit of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for decisions on the\n\nmerits to be avoided on the basis of . . . mere technicalities.\");\n\nYoung v. Gordon, 330 F.3d 76, 80-81 (1st Cir. 2003); Zukowski v.\n\nSt. Lukes Home Care Program, 326 F.3d 278, 283 n.4 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(notice of appeal may be read to include denial of underlying\n\nmotion, and not simply denial of motion for reconsideration, when\n\nit \"can be fairly inferred from the notice\" that appellant intended\n\nto appeal the underlying motion (quoting Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes,\n\n118 F.3d 10, 15 n.5 (1st Cir. 1997))); Correa, 298 F.3d at 21 n.3\n\n(briefs as well as notice of appeal can be consulted during this\n\nprocess); Chamorro, 304 F.3d at 3-4.   Here, based on our review of\n\nthe notice of appeal as well as the briefs, Allied manifested an\n\nintent, however awkwardly phrased, to appeal the underlying order\n\ndenying the motion to stay proceedings and compel arbitration as\n\nwell as the later denial of the Rule 59(e) motion.5\n\n          We will exercise jurisdiction to review the district\n\ncourt's initial order denying Allied's motion to stay proceedings\n\nand compel arbitration.   We turn now to the merits.\n\n\n     5\n      Marie should not have been misled by Allied's notice of\nappeal, but it is true that her initial brief focused on the\njurisdictional issue and touched on the merits only in a single\nfootnote.   Any possible prejudice was vitiated by this court's\norder of January 18, 2005, which granted Marie fourteen days to\nfile an additional brief on the merits; such a brief was filed by\nMarie on February 1, 2005. Another order of this court on February\n9 granted Allied seven days to file a brief responding to Marie's\nnew brief; such a brief was filed by Allied on February 16.\n\n                               -14-\n\f                                 III.\n\n           Given the nature of the issues in this case, the primary\n\nof which is waiver, our review of the district court's denial of a\n\nmotion to compel arbitration and stay judicial proceedings is de\n\nnovo.    In re Citigroup, Inc., 376 F.3d 23, 25-26 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(review of waiver issue, fact finding aside, is de novo); InterGen\n\nN.V. v. Grina, 344 F.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir. 2003); KKW Enters., Inc.\n\nv. Gloria Jean's Gourmet Coffees Franchising Corp., 184 F.3d 42, 48\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\nA. Who decides each issue: court or arbitrator?\n\n           The   initial   question   is   whether   the   court   or   the\n\narbitrator is empowered to decide the issues of (1) waiver of\n\nAllied's right to arbitrate, and (2) compliance with the 60-day\n\ncontractual provision.6 We begin by considering relevant precedent\n\nin this area.\n\n           It does not resolve these division of labor issues merely\n\nto note that they are usually, ultimately, matters of contract\n\ninterpretation. See Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U.S. 444,\n\n451-52 (2003) (plurality opinion); First Options of Chicago, Inc.\n\nv. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 943 (1995).         Certain presumptions have\n\n\n     6\n      Of course, it was not until plaintiff filed her amended\ncomplaint and served Allied on November 20, 2003 that Allied was on\nnotice of Marie's non-Title VII claims: assault and battery,\nnegligent supervision, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment.\nThere is no question that Allied made its demand for arbitration as\nto those claims within 60 days of its first notice of the claims.\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fbeen constructed to aid in the resolution of these issues of\n\ndivision of responsibility; these presumptions generally hold \"in\n\nthe absence of clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary.\"\n\nSee Green Tree, 539 U.S. at 452 (alterations, internal quotation\n\nmarks, and citation omitted).    These presumptions operate within\n\nthe underlying framework that \"any doubts concerning the scope of\n\narbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,\"\n\ngiven the pro-arbitration policy of the Federal Arbitration Act.\n\nMoses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-\n\n25 (1983).\n\n          The Supreme Court has most recently treated the issue of\n\nhow these presumptions operate in Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds,\n\nInc., 537 U.S. 79 (2002), and Green Tree, 539 U.S. at 444, where\n\nmuch of the Court's precedent in this area was consolidated and\n\nsimplified.   In Howsam, the Court held that the issue of whether an\n\narbitration claim was barred by a six-year limitations period\n\nembedded in the arbitration rules under which the parties had\n\nagreed to arbitrate was an issue for the arbitrator, and not for\n\nthe court.    Howsam, 537 U.S. at 85-86.   The Court noted that at\n\nleast two sorts of questions were presumptively for the court to\n\ndecide: (1) \"whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration\n\nclause,\" and (2) \"whether a concededly binding arbitration clause\n\napplied to a particular type of controversy.\"     Id. at 84.   Many\n\nother types of claims, including even some \"gateway questions\" that\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fmight dispose of the entire claim, are presumptively left to the\n\narbitrator.   See id. at 84-85.    This category includes \"procedural\n\nquestions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final\n\ndisposition.\"    Id. at 84 (internal quotation marks omitted).         This\n\ndistinction has employed the rough rubric that procedural issues,\n\neven if potentially dispositive, are left to the arbitrator;\n\nsubstantive questions about the kind of disputes intended for\n\narbitration     are   reserved   for   the   court,   absent   clear    and\n\nunmistakable evidence to the contrary.7\n\n          In Green Tree, the Court held that whether an arbitration\n\nagreement allowed for class arbitration was likewise an issue of\n\ncontract interpretation for the arbitrator rather than the judge.\n\nGreen Tree, 539 U.S. at 452-53.        The Court reaffirmed the basic\n\nframework of presumptions described in Howsam and held that the\n\nissue here, which went to \"what kind of arbitration proceeding the\n\nparties agreed to\" rather than \"whether they agreed to arbitrate a\n\nmatter,\" was presumptively for the arbitrator.         Id. at 452.\n\n\n\n     7\n      The general rule, which the Supreme Court culled from the\nRevised Uniform Arbitration Act (\"RUAA\") (which in turn was based\non trends and reasoning embodied in judicial precedent), was that\nan \"arbitrator shall decide whether a condition precedent to\narbitrability has been fulfilled\"; \"in the absence of an agreement\nto the contrary, issues of substantive arbitrability . . . are for\na court to decide and issues of procedural arbitrability, i.e.,\nwhether prerequisites such as time limits, notice, laches,\nestoppel, and other conditions precedent to an obligation to\narbitrate have been met, are for the arbitrators to decide.\" Id.\nat 85 (quoting RUAA § 6(c) & cmt. 2, 7 U.L.A. 12-13 (Supp. 2002)\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in Howsam)).\n\n                                   -17-\n\f          The Court in both Howsam and Green Tree also stressed\n\nissues of comparative expertise.               In the face of contractual\n\nsilence, courts should presume that parties intend to give their\n\ndisputes to the most able decisionmaker on a given issue, both for\n\ncontractual and public policy reasons.             Howsam, 537 U.S. at 85.\n\nThe Howsam Court stated that the arbitrators were presumptively\n\nmore expert in interpreting their own limitations rule, id., while\n\nthe Green Tree Court noted that the class arbitration issue raised\n\nquestions of \"contract interpretation and arbitration procedures,\"\n\nboth of which an arbitrator was \"well suited to answer,\" Green\n\nTree, 539 U.S. at 453.\n\n          This circuit has had only two opportunities to consider\n\nthe impact of Howsam and Green Tree on the division of issues\n\nbetween the court and the arbitrator. In Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc.\n\nv. United Food & Commercial Workers Union, 321 F.3d 251 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), we held that the question of whether three grievances being\n\narbitrated     separately     should    be     consolidated    into   a   single\n\narbitration was a \"procedural matter\" that was presumptively for\n\nthe arbitrator.       Id. at 254.         In Richard C. Young & Co. v.\n\nLeventhal, 389 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004), we held that a forum-\n\nselection clause in an arbitration agreement was likewise for the\n\narbitrator, as a \"procedural question.\"             Id. at 4-5.\n\n             The   district    court's        holding   in    its   two   orders\n\nnecessarily relied on two distinct points: (1) that Allied's demand\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\ffor arbitration was untimely because it failed to abide by the\n\nsixty-day limitations period specified in the contract itself, and\n\n(2) that Allied waived its right to arbitration by not filing for\n\narbitration during and after the EEOC proceeding. We address these\n\ntwo points in turn, finding that the contractual timeliness issue\n\nis for the arbitrator but that the issue of waiver by conduct is\n\nfor the court.\n\nContractual Time Limitation\n\n          The arbitration clause in the contract at issue states:\n\n\"Arbitration under this section must be initiated within sixty days\n\nof the action, inaction, or occurrence about which the party\n\ninitiating the arbitration is complaining.\"    The district court's\n\nconclusion that Allied's motion to stay proceedings was untimely\n\nrested, in part, on interpretation of this language.      The court\n\nheld that Allied had only sixty days from the conclusion of the\n\nEEOC proceedings in which to demand arbitration.    We hold that the\n\ncourt erred in itself interpreting the contractual time limit\n\nclause and applying it to Allied.\n\n          Under Howsam, which itself dealt with a time limit\n\nprovision, this is the sort of procedural prerequisite that is\n\npresumed to be for the arbitrator.    See Howsam, 537 U.S. at 84-85;\n\nsee also John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U.S. 543, 556-\n\n59 (1964) (issue of whether party failed to abide by procedural\n\nprerequisites to arbitration, including requirement that notice of\n\n\n                               -19-\n\fany grievance be given within four weeks, was for arbitrator and\n\nnot court).     While the time limit in Howsam was in the arbitrator's\n\nown rules rather than in the contract itself, this makes no\n\ndifference.8    The arbitrator might be expected to have comparative\n\nexpertise in determining the meaning of these sorts of contractual\n\nlimitations provisions in light of the background norms in this\n\nemployment area.       And as in Wiley, consideration of this kind of\n\nprocedural provision may entangle the court in issues that go\n\nproperly   to    the   merits   of   the    dispute,   which   are   for   the\n\narbitrator.     See Wiley, 376 U.S. at 557.      The presumption that the\n\ntime limitation clause is for the arbitrator is not overcome by any\n\nof the language in the contract.\n\nJudicially Found Waiver\n\n           The court's holding also rested implicitly on broader\n\nnotions of judicially implied waiver.          The argument for waiver in\n\nthis case is essentially that Allied's participation in the EEOC\n\nproceedings initiated by Marie without Allied having demanded\n\narbitration during or after those proceedings constituted conduct\n\n\n\n     8\n     Indeed,   the   rule   that   contractual   limitations   were\npresumptively for the arbitrator was the clear majority rule even\nbefore Howsam and Green Tree. See, e.g., Shearson Lehman Hutton,\nInc. v. Wagoner, 944 F.2d 114, 121 (2d Cir. 1991) (\"[W]e stated\nemphatically that any limitations defense--whether stemming from\nthe arbitration agreement, arbitration association rule, or state\nstatute--is an issue to be addressed by the arbitrators.\"); 2 I. R.\nMacneil et al., Federal Arbitration Law §§ 21.2.1.2, 21.2.2 (1994)\n(\"[G]enerally the effect of an express time limit for arbitration\nwill be decided by the arbitrators.\").\n\n                                     -20-\n\finconsistent with the future desire to arbitrate its claims.   See,\n\ne.g., Menorah Ins. Co. v. INX Reinsurance Corp., 72 F.3d 218, 220-\n\n21 (1st Cir. 1995); 2 I. R. Macneil et al., Federal Arbitration Law\n\n§ 21.3.1 (1994).   This court has a long history of deciding such\n\nwaiver claims itself; invariably, these cases involve the inquiry\n\ninto whether, by choosing or allowing the litigation of its claims\n\nbefore a court rather than an arbitrator, a party has waived its\n\nright to arbitrate.   See, e.g., Creative Solutions Group, Inc. v.\n\nPentzer Corp., 252 F.3d 28, 32-34 (1st Cir. 2001); Navieros Inter-\n\nAmericanos, S.A. v. M/V Vasilia Express, 120 F.3d 304, 316 (1st\n\nCir. 1997); Menorah, 72 F.3d at 221-22; Sevinor v. Merrill Lynch,\n\nPierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 807 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1986);\n\nJones Motor Co. v. Chauffeurs, Teamsters & Helpers Local Union No.\n\n633 of N.H., 671 F.2d 38, 42-44 (1st Cir. 1982).        Further, in\n\nMenorah and Jones Motor Co., we held explicitly that the issue of\n\nwaiver, at least where the alleged waiver was due to litigation-\n\nrelated activity, was presumptively for the judge and not the\n\narbitrator.   See Menorah, 72 F.3d at 222; Jones Motor Co., 671 F.2d\n\nat 43.    This was in accord with the overwhelming weight of pre-\n\nHowsam authority, which held that waiver due to litigation conduct\n\nwas generally for the court and not for the arbitrator.         See\n\ngenerally 2 I. R. Macneil et al., Federal Arbitration Law § 21.3\n\n(1994).\n\n\n\n\n                                -21-\n\f          Few courts have had occasion to consider the impact of\n\nHowsam and Green Tree on the doctrine of waiver of arbitration by\n\nconduct, and they have disagreed. The Eight Circuit has held, with\n\nlittle discussion, that Howsam and Green Tree indicate that waiver\n\nis now presumptively an issue for the arbitrator, and not for the\n\ncourts, at least where the conduct allegedly constituting waiver is\n\ndue to litigation in some other court.     See Nat'l Am. Ins. Co. v.\n\nTransamerica Occidental Life Ins. Co., 328 F.3d 462, 466 (8th Cir.\n\n2003); see also Bellevue Drug Co. v. Advance PCS, 333 F. Supp. 2d\n\n318, 324 (E.D. Pa. 2004) (relying on Howsam for the proposition\n\nthat \"it appears that . . . the issue of whether the defendant, by\n\nlitigating in this Court the present case, has waived the right to\n\ndemand arbitration should properly be presented in the first\n\ninstance to the arbitrator\").     The Transamerica court cited to\n\nlanguage in Howsam stating that \"the presumption is that the\n\narbitrator should decide 'allegation[s] of waiver, delay, or a like\n\ndefense to arbitrability.'\"   Howsam, 537 U.S. at 84 (quoting Moses\n\nH. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-25\n\n(1983) (alteration in Howsam)).\n\n          By contrast, a panel of the Fifth Circuit has held that\n\nthe issue of waiver by conduct is for the court, and not for the\n\narbitrator, in situations where the alleged waiver occurred due to\n\nconduct before the district court.     See Tristar Fin. Ins. Agency,\n\nInc. v. Equicredit Corp. of Am., 97 Fed. Appx. 462, 464 (5th Cir.\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f2004); see also Carbajal v. Household Bank, FSB, No. 00-C-0626,\n\n2003 WL 22159473, at *9 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 18, 2003).          This was\n\nparticularly so given the court's comparative expertise.          See\n\nTristar, 97 Fed. Appx. at 464.\n\n          In a stream of recent cases, the First Circuit has\n\ncontinued to decide waiver questions due to litigation-related\n\nactivities without discussing the impact of Howsam, most likely\n\nbecause no party raised the issue.      See In re Citigroup, Inc., 376\n\nF.3d 23, 26-29 (1st Cir. 2004); Rankin v. Allstate Ins. Co., 336\n\nF.3d 8, 12-14 (1st Cir. 2003); Restoration Pres. Masonry, Inc. v.\n\nGrove Europe Ltd., 325 F.3d 54, 60-62 (1st Cir. 2003).     It has been\n\nraised here.\n\n          We start our analysis of whether waiver by conduct in\n\nthis context is a decision for the court or for the arbitrator by\n\nnoting that textually under the FAA, a court is only permitted to\n\nstay a court action pending arbitration if \"the applicant for the\n\nstay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.\"        9\n\nU.S.C. § 3 (emphasis added). A \"default\" has generally been viewed\n\nby courts as including a \"waiver.\"       See, e.g., Patten Grading &\n\nPaving, Inc. v. Skanska USA Building, Inc., 380 F.3d 200, 204-05\n\n(4th Cir. 2004); Ivax Corp. v. B. Braun of Am., Inc., 286 F.3d\n\n1309, 1316 n.17 (11th Cir. 2002); MicroStrategy, Inc. v. Lauricia,\n\n268 F.3d 244, 249 (4th Cir. 2001); County of Middlesex v. Gevyn\n\nConstr. Corp., 450 F.2d 53, 56 n.2 (1st Cir. 1971) (only waiver due\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fto the pursuit of legal remedy inconsistent with arbitration is a\n\n\"default\" under 9 U.S.C. § 3).           This language would seem to place\n\na statutory command on courts, in cases where a stay is sought, to\n\ndecide the waiver issue themselves.                It is true that the same\n\nlanguage does not appear in section 4, the section dealing with\n\nattempts to compel arbitration, 9 U.S.C. § 4, but the Supreme Court\n\nhas cautioned us to interpret sections 3 and 4 of the FAA together.\n\nSee Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395,\n\n403-04 (1967); see also Doctor's Assocs., Inc. v. Distajo, 66 F.3d\n\n438, 456-57 (2d Cir. 1995).            At any rate, Allied is moving for a\n\nstay of Marie's lawsuit against it under section 3.\n\n              Howsam   also    relies    heavily    on   the   Revised     Uniform\n\nArbitration Act of 2000 (\"RUAA\").           The RUAA, in turn, as quoted by\n\nthe Howsam Court, establishes that procedural issues are generally\n\nfor the arbitrator and substantive issues generally for the court.\n\nSee RUAA § 6, cmt. 2, 7 U.L.A. 14-15 (Supp. 2004).              Another comment\n\nin the same section of the RUAA treats waiver as an issue for the\n\ncourt: \"Waiver is one area where courts, rather than arbitrators,\n\noften make the decision as to enforceability of an arbitration\n\nclause.\"      RUAA § 6, cmt. 5, 7 U.L.A. 16 (Supp. 2004).\n\n              As expressed in the commentary to the RUAA and elsewhere,\n\nthere   are    important      policy    reasons    why   a   court   and   not   an\n\narbitrator should decide waiver issues, at least where the waiver\n\n-- as has generally been true in our cases -- is due to litigation-\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\frelated activity.      Where the alleged waiver arises out of conduct\n\nwithin the very same litigation in which the party attempts to\n\ncompel arbitration or stay proceedings, then the district court has\n\npower to control the course of proceedings before it and to correct\n\nabuses of those proceedings.      See Jones Motor Co., 671 F.2d at 43;\n\nDoctor's Assocs., 66 F.3d at 456 & n.12.\n\n           Also, the comparative expertise considerations stressed\n\nin Howsam and Green Tree argue for judges to decide this issue.\n\nSee Howsam, 537 U.S. at 85; Green Tree, 539 U.S. at 452-53.                  Judges\n\nare well-trained to recognize abusive forum shopping. See Tristar,\n\n97 Fed. Appx. at 464; Bell v. Cendant Corp., 293 F.3d 563, 569 (2d.\n\nCir. 2002); Jones Motor Co., 671 F.2d at 43.              As well, the inquiry\n\nheavily implicates \"judicial procedures,\" which Green Tree suggests\n\nshould be an important factor in presuming that an issue is for the\n\ncourt.     See Green Tree, 539 U.S. at 452-53 (emphasis added).\n\nFurther,   the     procedural   waiver       issue   is    not    likely     to   be\n\nintertwined with the merits of the dispute.               See RUAA § 6 cmt. 5,\n\n7 U.L.A. 16 (Supp. 2004); see also Wiley, 376 U.S. at 557-58; Prima\n\nPaint Corp., 388 U.S. at 403-04.\n\n           Finally, sending waiver claims to the arbitrator would be\n\nexceptionally inefficient. A waiver defense is raised by one party\n\nto a lawsuit in response to another party's motion to compel\n\narbitration   or    stay   judicial    proceedings        on   the   basis   of   an\n\narbitration agreement signed by the parties.                   If the arbitrator\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fwere to find that the defendant had waived its right to arbitrate,\n\nthen the case would inevitably end up back before the district\n\ncourt with the plaintiff again pressing his claims. The case would\n\nhave bounced back and forth between tribunals without making any\n\nprogress.    See 2 I. R. Macneil et al., Federal Arbitration Law §\n\n21.3 (1994); RUAA § 6 cmt. 5, 7 U.L.A. 16 (Supp. 2004).\n\n            This is different in kind from the arbitrator's normal\n\nresolution of a gateway issue: normally, the resolution of such an\n\nissue would bar not only arbitration but any sort of litigation on\n\nthe issues by either side.   Thus, allowing courts to decide waiver\n\nissues -- at least when due to litigation-related activity --\n\nfurthers a key purpose of the FAA: to permit speedy resolution of\n\ndisputes.   See, e.g., Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S.\n\n213, 218-20 (1985); Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp., 460 U.S. at 22-23;\n\nsee also Menorah Ins. Co., 72 F.3d at 222 (observing in context of\n\ninternational, non-FAA arbitration case that \"[a]rbitration clauses\n\nwere not meant to be another weapon in the arsenal for imposing\n\ndelay and costs in the dispute resolution process\"). Moreover, the\n\nHowsam and Green Tree rules exist partly \"to avoid . . . delay.\"\n\nShaw's Supermarkets, Inc., 321 F.3d at 255.      We hold that the\n\nSupreme Court in Howsam and Green Tree did not intend to disturb\n\nthe traditional rule that waiver by conduct, at least where due to\n\n\n\n\n                                -26-\n\flitigation-related activity, is presumptively an issue for the\n\ncourt.9\n\n               The waiver here is somewhat unusual in that the claim is\n\nof litigation activity before the EEOC that is inconsistent with a\n\nright to arbitrate, as opposed to activity before a court.                      But\n\nthis       makes   no   difference.   Courts   are    still   well     suited    to\n\ndetermine the sort of forum-shopping and procedural issues that are\n\nlikely to arise in litigation before the EEOC, and sending the\n\nwaiver issue to the arbitrator would still be inefficient.                      The\n\nproper presumption in this case is that the waiver issue is for the\n\ncourt and not the arbitrator.\n\n               Allied, seeking reversal on any available ground, argues\n\nthat this presumption is overcome because of specific language in\n\nthe    arbitration       agreement.    There   is    no   merit   to    Allied's\n\ncontention.10       A shifting of the issue to the arbitrator will only\n\nbe found where there is \"clear and unmistakable evidence\" of such\n\nan intent in the arbitration agreement.              No such evidence exists\n\n\n       9\n     The conduct allegedly constituting waiver in a given case\ncould conceivably be non-litigation-related, although in practice\nvirtually all cases have involved litigation-related waiver. We do\nnot here discuss the proper presumptive division of labor as\nbetween courts and arbitrators for non-litigation-related waiver\nclaims or for other doctrines that are sometimes (erroneously)\nreferred to as waiver, such as laches.\n       10\n      We are not sure that waiver can, in all cases, be contracted\naway from the court's competence at all. The \"default\" language in\nSection 3 of the FAA, which as we noted includes waiver, perhaps\ngives courts a duty, which cannot be shifted by contract between\nthe parties, to determine whether waiver has occurred.\n\n                                      -27-\n\fhere.   First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 944\n\n(1995) (quoting AT&T Techs., Inc. v. Communications Workers of Am.,\n\n475 U.S. 643, 649 (1986) (alterations omitted)).                The standard in\n\nFirst   Options   is    meant    to   be    a   high   one,    and   the    normal\n\npresumptions in favor of arbitration do not apply.                   See, e.g.,\n\nCoady v Ashcraft & Gerel, 223 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           Allied      focuses   on   the       following     language     in   the\n\nagreement: \"Employer and employee agree to submit to final and\n\nbinding arbitration any and all disputes, claims (whether in tort,\n\ncontract, statutory, or otherwise), and disagreements concerning\n\nthe interpretation or application of this Agreement . . . including\n\nthe arbitrability of any such controversy or claim . . . .\"\n\n(emphasis added).        Specifically, Allied focuses on the clause\n\nstating that questions of \"arbitrability\" are for the arbitrator.\n\n\"Arbitrability\" itself encompasses a variety of possible meanings,\n\nbut the most obvious meaning focuses on certain substantive issues,\n\nand particularly the question of whether a particular kind of\n\ndispute at issue falls within the scope of the arbitration clause.\n\nMost cases that discuss arbitrability focus on these substantive\n\nissues.   See, e.g., First Options, 514 U.S. at 942; AT&T, 475 U.S.\n\nat 645; Coady, 223 F.3d at 9; see also Johnson v. Polaris Sales,\n\nInc., 257 F. Supp. 2d 300, 308-09 (D. Me. 2003) (interpreting\n\n\"arbitrability\" language in arbitration agreement to throw issues\n\nof substantive scope to the arbitrator); 1 Domke on Commercial\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\fArbitration § 15 (3d ed. 2003) (discussing arbitrability question\n\nas an issue of the scope of the arbitration agreement).                  The\n\ncontext of the agreement suggests that this sort of substantive\n\nmeaning   is   intended   for    the    term   \"arbitrability\"   here;   the\n\nreference to \"arbitrability\" is surrounded by references to which\n\ntypes of claims should be arbitrated and which should not be.             We\n\ncannot say that the use of the term here evinces a clear and\n\nunmistakable    intent    to    have    waiver   issues   decided   by   the\n\narbitrator.    There are no references to waiver or similar terms\n\nanywhere in the arbitration agreement.            Neither party should be\n\nforced to arbitrate the issue of waiver by conduct without a\n\nclearer indication in the agreement that they have agreed to do so.\n\nThe issue of who would decide such a question is an \"arcane\" one\n\nthat employees are unlikely to have considered unless clearly\n\nspelled out by the employer.       See First Options, 514 U.S. at 945.\n\n           We hold that the question of waiver of Allied's right to\n\narbitrate due to its participation in EEOC proceedings is properly\n\nfor the judge, and we turn now to the merits of that question.\n\nB. Waiver due to EEOC proceedings\n\n           Marie urges us to find waiver both from the fact that\n\nAllied failed to file for arbitration during the pendency of the\n\nEEOC investigation and from the fact that it failed to file for\n\narbitration after the EEOC proceeding had concluded with the EEOC's\n\nfinding of no violation but before Marie had brought her private\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fcivil suit in federal district court.         At least two elements of\n\nwaiver by conduct that this circuit has identified are (1) undue\n\ndelay in bringing arbitration that is inconsistent with the desire\n\nto arbitrate and (2) prejudice to the other party from that delay.\n\nSee Rankin v. Allstate Ins. Co., 336 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nMenorah, 72 F.3d at 221-22.        Since, in this case, there was no\n\nundue delay, we need not reach the prejudice issue.\n\n            The argument that waiver occurred during the pendency of\n\nthe EEOC proceedings runs contrary to circuit precedent.         Brennan\n\nv. King, 139 F.3d 258, 263-64 (1st Cir. 1998), found no waiver\n\nwhere an employer failed to raise its right to arbitrate with the\n\nEEOC during the pendency of EEOC proceedings.            As well, since\n\nBrennan, the Supreme Court has held that an employer cannot stop\n\nthe EEOC, a third party, from bringing a public enforcement action\n\nagainst an employer by invoking an arbitration agreement between\n\nthe employer and the relevant employee.       See EEOC v. Waffle House,\n\nInc., 534 U.S. 279, 297-98 (2002).        The EEOC is a nonparty to the\n\narbitration agreement and therefore cannot be bound by it. See id.\n\nat   294.     The   same   logic   applies    to   a   preliminary   EEOC\n\ninvestigation, which also cannot be halted by an arbitration\n\nagreement between the complaining employee and her employer.\n\n            If the EEOC's investigation of an employer cannot be\n\nstopped by invoking an arbitration agreement, then forcing the\n\nemployee and employer to begin an arbitration proceeding during the\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\fpendency of that investigation will automatically result in two\n\nadjudications involving the same issue at the same time: (1) the\n\nEEOC investigation of the employer at the employee's urging and (2)\n\nthe arbitration between the employer and the employee that the\n\nemployer initiated. This is quite inefficient.11 Further, the EEOC\n\ninvestigation might definitively resolve the claim: the employee\n\nmight receive a notice that the EEOC did not wish to start an\n\nenforcement action, along with a rationale for this decision and a\n\nright to sue letter, and determine that she did not want to sue\n\nafter all.    That was not Marie's reaction to her letter, but it may\n\nwell be the reaction of many employees.              And if this were the\n\nreaction,    then   there   would   be   no   need   for   employer-employee\n\narbitration at all.\n\n             Thus, forcing employers to bring arbitration during the\n\npendency of EEOC investigations is a waste of resources and is\n\ncontrary to the general purposes of the FAA.12              See, e.g., Dean\n\nWitter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213, 218-20 (1985); Sink v.\n\n\n\n     11\n      This is true even if one party sought to stay the arbitration\npending EEOC proceedings, forcing the expenditure of resources to\nobtain a stay and running a risk that the other party will oppose\nor that the arbitrator will decline the stay.\n     12\n      We note as well that there is little risk of abusive forum\nshopping by the employer in this kind of situation. Since, under\nWaffle House, the EEOC cannot be stopped from investigating and\nlitigating against the employer by virtue of an arbitration clause,\neven if the employer initiates arbitration only when things turn\nbadly for it before the EEOC, the EEOC will not be hindered in its\npursuit of the employer.\n\n                                    -31-\n\fAden Enters., 352 F.3d 1197, 1201 (9th Cir. 2003).            It is also\n\ncontrary to the scheme established in the federal employment\n\ndiscrimination statutes, which generally is designed to avoid\n\ninefficient, duplicative proceedings.          See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n5(f)(1) (employee's private civil lawsuit against employer may only\n\nbe filed after EEOC has investigated and issued a right to sue\n\nletter; no private civil lawsuit may be initiated during the 180-\n\nday period allotted for EEOC investigations or after the EEOC has\n\ndecided to bring a public enforcement action); see also Gilmer v.\n\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 27 (1991) (explaining\n\nsimilar scheme under 29 U.S.C. § 626, the Age Discrimination in\n\nEmployment Act).13\n\n             We reaffirm that an employer cannot waive its right to\n\narbitration by failing to raise the arbitration defense with the\n\nEEOC or by failing to initiate arbitration during the pendency of\n\nthe   EEOC   proceedings.      The    employer's   failure   to   initiate\n\narbitration during the pendency of such proceedings merely reflects\n\na desire to avoid inefficiency and is not action inconsistent with\n\na desire to arbitrate.      Our holding here is in accord with the few\n\ncases elsewhere to discuss this issue.         See, e.g., Brown v. ITT\n\nConsumer Fin. Corp., 211 F.3d 1217, 1222-23 (11th Cir. 2000);\n\n\n      13\n      We say nothing here about whether or when an employer has a\nright to initiate an arbitration during the course of an EEOC\ninvestigation. We hold only that an employer should not be forced\nto file for arbitration during an EEOC investigation by finding a\nwaiver of its right to arbitrate if it does not make such a filing.\n\n                                     -32-\n\fGonzalez v. GE Group Adm'rs, Inc., 321 F. Supp. 2d 165, 171-72 (D.\n\nMass. 2004).\n\n          The same considerations apply after an EEOC investigation\n\nhas concluded with a finding of no violation.    We will not force\n\nthe employer to make a wasteful, preemptive decision to arbitrate\n\nwhen it has no idea whether a dispute will still exist.     As the\n\nBrown court stated, in general there is no need for the non-\n\ncomplaining party, the employer, to make a \"pre-suit demand for\n\narbitration.\"    Brown, 211 F.3d at 1223.\n\n          Marie has rightly made no claim here that Allied's\n\nactions after Marie's lawsuit was filed constitute waiver of\n\nAllied's right to arbitrate.   The motion to compel arbitration and\n\nstay proceedings was made in a reasonably prompt fashion after the\n\nlawsuit began.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          The decision of the district court is reversed, and the\n\ncase is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nSince Allied has not waived its right to arbitrate, the issue of\n\ntimeliness under the sixty-day contractual provision is for the\n\narbitrator, and Marie has raised no other issues on appeal,14 an\n\n\n\n     14\n      Marie has made no argument, for example, that the substantive\nscope of the arbitration provision between her and Allied does not\ninclude all of the claims that she has raised. In fact, in her\nappellate brief on the merits, Marie concedes that all claims that\nshe has raised to the district court are within the substantive\nscope of the arbitration clause.\n\n                                -33-\n\forder should enter compelling arbitration of all claims that Marie\n\nhas raised and either staying or dismissing Marie's judicial\n\nproceedings in conformance with the FAA. See Bercovitch v. Baldwin\n\nSch., Inc., 133 F.3d 141, 156 & n.21 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"[A] court\n\nmay dismiss, rather than stay, a case [under 9 U.S.C. § 3] when all\n\nof the issues before the court are arbitrable.\").\n\n\n\n\n                               -34-\n\f",

Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,</i> 537 U.S. 79, 123 S.Ct. 588, 154 L.Ed.2d 491 (2002), and <i>Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Bazzle,</i> 539 U.S. 444, 123 S.Ct. 2402, 156 L.Ed.2d 414 (2003). The employee concedes that the Title VII claims involved in this case are arbitrable. <i>See Rosenberg v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.,</i> 170 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.1999). The key issue is whether an employer waives its contractual right to compel arbitration of a Title VII claim by not filing for arbitration when the employee initiates an EEOC complaint, but instead waiting and only moving to compel arbitration after the employee later files a civil claim in federal court. We hold here that although the issue of compliance with a contractual time limit should, in the first instance, be addressed by the arbitrator, the issue of waiver of the right to arbitrate due to inconsistent activity in another litigation forum remains an issue for the court even after the <i>Howsam</i> and <i>Green Tree</i> holdings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, on the merits, we hold that an employer does not waive its right to arbitration by failing to demand arbitration during the pendency of an EEOC investigation. This confirms in the light of intervening Supreme Court cases a result this court had reached earlier on different reasoning. <i>See Brennan v. King,</i> 139 F.3d 258, 263-64 (1st Cir.1998). Our reasoning rests in part on <i>EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc.,</i> 534 U.S. 279, 122 S.Ct. 754, 151 L.Ed.2d 755 (2002), which held that an employer cannot preclude the EEOC from bringing an enforcement action based on an employee's complaint by relying on an arbitration clause between the employer and employee. In light of <i>Waffle House,</i> a rule forcing the employer to file for arbitration during the pendency of an EEOC investigation would lead to wasteful, duplicative proceedings, and we reject such a result. We hold that the employer in this case has not waived its right to arbitrate the claims at issue. We reverse the decision of the district court refusing to stay judicial proceedings and compel arbitration, and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied Home Mortgage Corporation is a Texas corporation in the business of mortgage banking; it has a branch office in Woburn, Massachusetts. Martha M. Marie began working for Allied's Woburn branch on November 1, 2000 as a mortgage loan processor. Joseph Thompson, a branch manager of Allied's Woburn branch, hired Marie and was her supervisor. He was Marie's boyfriend at the time of her hiring. She was to be compensated by receiving fifty percent of any loan origination fees on all loans she originated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marie alleges that Thompson used \"undue influence, verbal abuse, and threats of physical abuse\" to divert loan origination credit from Marie to Thompson, to force Marie to engage in an \"autodialing\" scheme in violation of The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, 47 U.S.C. &#167; 227, and to force Marie to pay for office supplies out of her own pocket. Marie alleges that Allied knew that some of her origination credit was being diverted from Marie to Thompson and did nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marie also alleges that Thompson threw her out of a stopped car in the winter of 2002 because he was angry with her work. Finally, she alleges that Thompson physically beat Marie in June 2002 both because he was angry with her work and because he thought she was having a sexual affair with another Allied employee. Marie alleges that Thompson wanted her to have sexual relations solely with him. Marie never returned to work after the beating in June &#8212; the company listed her termination date as June 28, 2002. She claims that Allied falsely reported in its personnel records that she voluntarily quit her position. In July 2002, Marie sought and obtained an Abuse Prevention Order from a Massachusetts state court requiring Thompson to stay away from her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Marie was hired by Allied on November 1, 2000, she signed an employment contract that was also signed by Thompson as Allied's representative. This four-page standard-form agreement contained an arbitration clause in Article 5.1. The clause states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Employer and Employee agree to submit to final and binding arbitration any and all disputes, claims (whether in tort, contract, statutory, or otherwise), and disagreements concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement and Employee's employment by Employer and the termination of this Agreement and Employee's employment by Employer including the arbitrability of any such controversy or claim.... Arbitration under this section must be initiated within sixty days of the action, inaction, or occurrence about which the party initiating the arbitration is complaining.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement also stated that any arbitration was to be conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 23, 2003, Marie filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) against Allied and Thompson. The charge alleged sexual discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and applicable state law. The charge, in particular, alleged that during Marie's employment with Allied, Thompson \"physically abused [her] and verbally abused [her] repeatedly because he thought [she] was having a sexual affair with another employee, and Thompson wanted [her] to have sexual relations only with him.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied filed a response to this charge on May 22, 2003. The EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Rights on July 18, 2003, stating that it had concluded its investigation without finding that any violation of Title VII occurred. It stated that the evidence showed that Marie and Thompson lived together and represented themselves as domestic partners; there was no evidence that her \"consensual relationship\" with Thompson was \"unwelcome\" as required to be actionable under Title VII. Also, Thompson's actions were motivated by his personal relationship, not by Marie's gender. Finally, the dismissal noted that Marie did not utilize Allied's existing sexual harassment policy. The dismissal stated that Marie now had a right to sue Thompson or Allied for sexual discrimination in federal or state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 14, 2003, Marie filed a civil complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court, naming Allied and Thompson as defendants; an amended complaint was filed on November 6, 2003. The amended complaint named both Allied and Thompson as defendants for assault and battery and sexual harassment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and named Allied for negligent supervision of Thompson and for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Marie asked for money damages and attorney's fees and costs under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson has never been served; Allied was served on November 20, 2003. Allied removed the action to federal district court in Massachusetts on December 9, 2003. On December 22, Allied filed a demand for arbitration with the AAA, within sixty days of being served. On December 23, 2003, Allied moved to compel arbitration and to stay the court proceedings; the motion was opposed by Marie. This motion was denied on January 8, 2004 (the order was docketed on January 12, 2004), by order stating: \"It being undisputed that the initiation of arbitration proceedings occurred on December 22, 2003, more than sixty days after the conclusion of [the] charge proceedings before the [EEOC], the demand for arbitration is untimely under Article V of plaintiff's employment agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied did not appeal this order but instead, on January 26, 2004, moved to dismiss Marie's complaint as untimely, or, in the alternative, to reconsider the denial of the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). This motion was denied as to each alternative on February 18. The court considered the contract to be one of adhesion and relied upon the rule that an \"ambiguous provision in an adhesion agreement will be strictly construed against the party that wrote it.\" The court also stated that Allied's argument was based on the premise that Marie was required to initiate arbitration within sixty days of the conclusion of the EEOC proceedings if she wanted to pursue her claims, while Allied had six years (the full limitation period for contract actions under Massachusetts law) to demand arbitration. This, the court stated, was inequitable and a \"breathtaking\" reading of the contract. The court, citing <i>Martin v. Norwood,</i> 395 Mass. 159, 478 N.E.2d 955, 957-58 (1985), held that Allied, through its delay, had \"waived\" its right to arbitrate the claims and thus the lawsuit would proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's January 12 and February 18 holdings relied on two distinct theories for why arbitration should not be compelled and litigation stayed: (1) Allied's purported failure to comply with the precise 60-day time limit contained in the arbitration provision, as interpreted by the court, and (2) Allied's waiver of its right to arbitrate due to unreasonable delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied filed a notice of appeal to this court on March 12, 2004. The notice appealed the district court's February 18, 2004 order, \"insofar as such [o]rder denied Allied's motion for reconsideration of the denial of Allied's motion to compel arbitration.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first examine the complex issue of our jurisdiction in this case; Marie argues there is none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, appeals are only permitted from final judgments of the district court. There are a limited number of exceptions. <i>See, e.g., Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.,</i> 506 U.S. 139, 142-43, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993). A few of these exceptions occur in the arbitration context, as stated in the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). <i>See</i> 9 U.S.C. &#167; 16(a). Appeal may be taken from an interlocutory order of the district court \"refusing a stay of any action\" pending arbitration or \"denying a petition ... to order arbitration to proceed,\" although no appeal may be taken from a district court's granting such a stay or granting a motion to compel arbitration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Id.</i> &#167; 16(a)(1), (b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Allied filed a motion with the district court to stay court proceedings and compel arbitration; both requests were denied and these denials were immediately appealable. But interlocutory appeals, like all other appeals, are governed by the time limitations identified in Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). This provision requires a party to file the notice of appeal within 30 days \"after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\" <i>Id.</i> This timeliness requirement is jurisdictional. <i>See Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co.,</i> 459 U.S. 56, 61, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) (\"It is well settled that the requirement of a timely notice of appeal is `mandatory and jurisdictional.'\" (quoting <i>Browder v. Dir., Ill. Dep't of Corr.,</i> 434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978))); <i>see also Davignon v. Clemmey,</i> 322 F.3d 1, 10-11 (1st Cir.2003) (timely notice of appeal requirement is jurisdictional although it is not an Article III requirement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than appealing immediately, Allied filed a motion for reconsideration. Allied argues that its filing a motion for reconsideration within ten days of the initial order tolled the time for appeal until after the court's ruling on the motion for reconsideration. Since an appeal was filed within thirty days of the ruling on the motion for reconsideration, Allied argues that the appeal is timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied's position is correct. Allied's motion for reconsideration stated that its basis was as a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e); at any rate, we have held that a motion for reconsideration should be construed as a motion to alter or amend a judgment under Rule 59(e) where this is relevant for jurisdictional purposes. <i>See, e.g., United States v. $23,000 in U.S. Currency,</i> 356 F.3d 157, 165 n. 9 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Young v. Gordon,</i> 330 F.3d 76, 80 (1st Cir.2003); <i>In re Sun Pipe Line Co.,</i> 831 F.2d 22, 24 (1st Cir.1987) (\"Notwithstanding that [appellant] did not denominate any particular rule as the springboard for its reconsideration motion, it is settled in this circuit that a motion which asked the court to modify its earlier disposition of a case because of an allegedly erroneous legal result is brought under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e).\"). The motion for reconsideration filed here must be so construed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"judgment\" that Allied asked the court to \"alter or amend\" was the court's January 8, 2004 order denying Allied's motion to stay proceedings and compel arbitration. Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). For purposes of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this order was a judgment because it was an \"order from which an appeal lies.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(a); <i>see Abdulwali v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth.,</i> 315 F.3d 302, 303-04 (D.C.Cir.2003) (order denying summary judgment based on sovereign immunity was \"judgment\" for purposes of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure); <i>Lichtenberg v. Besicorp Group Inc.,</i> 204 F.3d 397, 400-01 (2d Cir.2000) (same with respect to order granting a preliminary injunction); <i>Roque-Rodriguez v. Lema Moya,</i> 926 F.2d 103, 106 (1st Cir.1991) (same with respect to order denying summary judgment based on qualified immunity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion requesting that the January 8 order be altered or amended was timely filed within ten days of that order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). Under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A), certain motions, if timely filed, can toll the thirty-day appeal period. A motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment appears on this list. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). A timely motion to alter or amend a \"judgment\" that is an appealable interlocutory order tolls the time for filing a notice of appeal. <i>See Lichtenberg,</i> 204 F.3d at 400-01; <i>Roque-Rodriguez,</i> 926 F.2d at 106-07; <i>Denley v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc.,</i> 733 F.2d 39, 41 (6th Cir.1984). The thirty-day clock restarts after the order denying the motion to alter or amend the judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A). This order was handed down on February 18, 2004; Allied filed its notice of appeal on March 12, 2004. The notice of appeal was thus timely as to the underlying motion to stay proceedings or compel arbitration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marie argues that, even granting all of this, Allied did not attempt to appeal the underlying motion to stay proceedings or compel arbitration, but only the order denying reconsideration, because its notice of appeal named only the latter order. It is true that the notice of appeal named only the order denying Allied's motion for reconsideration as being appealed, and Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B) states that a party should \"designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed.\" As well, a Rule 59(e) motion is separate from the underlying judgment for purposes of appeal. <i>Correa v. Cruisers,</i> 298 F.3d 13, 21 n. 3 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, when determining what is actually being appealed, we have been liberal. <i>See Chamorro v. Puerto Rican Cars, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.2002). We look to the appellant's intent on the record as a whole and at whether the appellee has been misled by the appellant's unclear notice. <i>See Foman v. Davis,</i> 371 U.S. 178, 181-82, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962) (\"It is ... entirely contrary to the spirit of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for decisions on the merits to be avoided on the basis of ... mere technicalities.\"); <i>Young v. Gordon,</i> 330 F.3d 76, 80-81 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Zukowski v. St. Lukes Home Care Program,</i> 326 F.3d 278, 283 n. 4 (1st Cir.2003) (notice of appeal may be read to include denial of underlying motion, and not simply denial of motion for reconsideration, when it \"can be fairly inferred from the notice\" that appellant intended to appeal the underlying motion (quoting <i>Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes,</i> 118 F.3d 10, 15 n. 5 (1st Cir.1997))); <i>Correa,</i> 298 F.3d at 21 n. 3 (briefs as well as notice of appeal can be consulted during this process); <i>Chamorro,</i> 304 F.3d at 3-4. Here, based on our review of the notice of appeal as well as the briefs, Allied manifested an intent, however awkwardly phrased, to appeal the underlying order denying the motion to stay proceedings and compel arbitration as well as the later denial of the Rule 59(e) motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will exercise jurisdiction to review the district court's initial order denying Allied's motion to stay proceedings and compel arbitration.

Corp. v. Bazzle,</i> 539 U.S. 444, 451-52, 123 S.Ct. 2402, 156 L.Ed.2d 414 (2003) (plurality opinion); <i>First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan,</i> 514 U.S. 938, 943, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995). Certain presumptions have been constructed to aid in the resolution of these issues of division of responsibility; these presumptions generally hold \"in the absence of clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary.\" <i>See Green Tree,</i> 539 U.S. at 452, 123 S.Ct. 2402 (alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted). These presumptions operate within the underlying framework that \"any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,\" given the pro-arbitration policy of the Federal Arbitration Act. <i>Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,</i> 460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has most recently treated the issue of how these presumptions operate in <i>Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,</i> 537 U.S. 79, 123 S.Ct. 588, 154 L.Ed.2d 491 (2002), and <i>Green Tree,</i> 539 U.S. at 444, 123 S.Ct. 2402, where much of the Court's precedent in this area was consolidated and simplified. In <i>Howsam,</i> the Court held that the issue of whether an arbitration claim was barred by a six-year limitations period embedded in the arbitration rules under which the parties had agreed to arbitrate was an issue for the arbitrator, and not for the court. <i>Howsam,</i> 537 U.S. at 85-86, 123 S.Ct. 588. The Court noted that at least two sorts of questions were presumptively for the <i>court</i> to decide: (1) \"whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause,\" and (2) \"whether a concededly binding arbitration clause applied to a particular type of controversy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 84, 123 S.Ct. 588. Many other types of claims, including even some \"gateway questions\" that might dispose of the entire claim, are presumptively left to the arbitrator. <i>See id.</i> at 84-85, 123 S.Ct. 588. This category includes \"procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition.\" <i>Id.</i> at 84, 123 S.Ct. 588 (internal quotation marks omitted). This distinction has employed the rough rubric that procedural issues, even if potentially dispositive, are left to the arbitrator; substantive questions about the kind of disputes intended for arbitration are reserved for the court, absent clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Green Tree,</i> the Court held that whether an arbitration agreement allowed for class arbitration was likewise an issue of contract interpretation for the arbitrator rather than the judge. <i>Green Tree,</i> 539 U.S. at 452-53, 123 S.Ct. 2402. The Court reaffirmed the basic framework of presumptions described in <i>Howsam</i> and held that the issue here, which went to \"what <i>kind of arbitration proceeding</i> the parties agreed to\" rather than \"<i>whether they agreed to arbitrate a matter,</i>\" was presumptively for the arbitrator. <i>Id.</i> at 452, 123 S.Ct. 2402.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court in both <i>Howsam</i> and <i>Green Tree</i> also stressed issues of comparative expertise. In the face of contractual silence, courts should presume that parties intend to give their disputes to the most able decisionmaker on a given issue, both for contractual and public policy reasons. <i>Howsam,</i> 537 U.S. at 85, 123 S.Ct. 588. The <i>Howsam</i> Court stated that the arbitrators were presumptively more expert in interpreting their own limitations rule, <i>id.,</i> while the <i>Green Tree</i> Court noted that the class arbitration issue raised questions of \"contract interpretation and arbitration procedures,\" both of which an arbitrator was \"well suited to answer,\" <i>Green Tree,</i> 539 U.S. at 453, 123 S.Ct. 2402.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has had only two opportunities to consider the impact of <i>Howsam</i> and <i>Green Tree</i> on the division of issues between the court and the arbitrator. In <i>Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc. v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union,</i> 321 F.3d 251 (1st Cir.2003), we held that the question of whether three grievances being arbitrated separately should be consolidated into a single arbitration was a \"procedural matter\" that was presumptively for the arbitrator. <i>Id.</i> at 254. In <i>Richard C. Young &amp; Co. v. Leventhal,</i> 389 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2004), we held that a forum-selection clause in an arbitration agreement was likewise for the arbitrator, as a \"procedural question.\" <i>Id.</i> at 4-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's holding in its two orders necessarily relied on two distinct points: (1) that Allied's demand for arbitration was untimely because it failed to abide by the sixty-day limitations period specified in the contract itself, and (2) that Allied waived its right to arbitration by not filing for arbitration during and after the EEOC proceeding. We address these two points in turn, finding that the contractual timeliness issue is for the arbitrator but that the issue of waiver by conduct is for the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Contractual Time Limitation</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitration clause in the contract at issue states: \"Arbitration under this section must be initiated within sixty days of the action, inaction, or occurrence about which the party initiating the arbitration is complaining.\" The district court's conclusion that Allied's motion to stay proceedings was untimely rested, in part, on interpretation of this language. The court held that Allied had only sixty days from the conclusion of the EEOC proceedings in which to demand arbitration. We hold that the court erred in itself interpreting the contractual time limit clause and applying it to Allied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under <i>Howsam,</i> which itself dealt with a time limit provision, this is the sort of procedural prerequisite that is presumed to be for the arbitrator. <i>See Howsam,</i> 537 U.S. at 84-85, 123 S.Ct. 588; <i>see also John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston,</i> 376 U.S. 543, 556-59, 84 S.Ct. 909, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964) (issue of whether party failed to abide by procedural prerequisites to arbitration, including requirement that notice of any grievance be given within four weeks, was for arbitrator and not court). While the time limit in <i>Howsam</i> was in the arbitrator's own rules rather than in the contract itself, this makes no difference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The arbitrator might be expected to have comparative expertise in determining the meaning of these sorts of contractual limitations provisions in light of the background norms in this employment area. And as in <i>Wiley,</i> consideration of this kind of procedural provision may entangle the court in issues that go properly to the merits of the dispute, which are for the arbitrator. <i>See Wiley,</i> 376 U.S. at 557, 84 S.Ct. 909. The presumption that the time limitation clause is for the arbitrator is not overcome by any of the language in the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Judicially Found Waiver</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's holding also rested implicitly on broader notions of judicially implied waiver. The argument for waiver in this case is essentially that Allied's participation in the EEOC proceedings initiated by Marie without Allied having demanded arbitration during or after those proceedings constituted conduct inconsistent with the future desire to arbitrate its claims. <i>See, e.g., Menorah Ins. Co. v. INX Reinsurance Corp.,</i> 72 F.3d 218, 220-21 (1st Cir.1995); 2 I.R. Macneil et al., <i>Federal Arbitration Law</i> &#167; 21.3.1 (1994). This court has a long history of deciding such waiver claims itself; invariably, these cases involve the inquiry into whether, by choosing or allowing the litigation of its claims before a court rather than an arbitrator, a party has waived its right to arbitrate. <i>See, e.g., Creative Solutions Group, Inc. v. Pentzer Corp.,</i> 252 F.3d 28, 32-34 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Navieros Inter-Americanos, S.A. v. M/V Vasilia Express,</i> 120 F.3d 304, 316 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Menorah,</i> 72 F.3d at 221-22; <i>Sevinor v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.,</i> 807 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir.1986); <i>Jones Motor Co. v. Chauffeurs, Teamsters &amp; Helpers Local Union No. 633 of N.H.,</i> 671 F.2d 38, 42-44 (1st Cir.1982). Further, in <i>Menorah</i> and <i>Jones Motor Co.,</i> we held explicitly that the issue of waiver, at least where the alleged waiver was due to litigation-related activity, was presumptively for the judge and not the arbitrator. <i>See Menorah,</i> 72 F.3d at 222; <i>Jones Motor Co.,</i> 671 F.2d at 43. This was in accord with the overwhelming weight of pre-<i>Howsam</i> authority, which held that waiver due to litigation conduct was generally for the court and not for the arbitrator. <i>See generally</i> 2 I.R. Macneil et al., <i>Federal Arbitration Law</i> &#167; 21.3 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Few courts have had occasion to consider the impact of <i>Howsam</i> and <i>Green Tree</i> on the doctrine of waiver of arbitration by conduct, and they have disagreed. The Eight Circuit has held, with little discussion, that <i>Howsam</i> and <i>Green Tree</i> indicate that waiver is now presumptively an issue for the arbitrator, and not for the courts, at least where the conduct allegedly constituting waiver is due to litigation in some other court. <i>See Nat'l Am. Ins. Co. v. Transamerica Occidental Life Ins. Co.,</i> 328 F.3d 462, 466 (8th Cir.2003); <i>see also Bellevue Drug Co. v. Advance PCS,</i> 333 F.Supp.2d 318, 324 (E.D.Pa.2004) (relying on <i>Howsam</i> for the proposition that \"it appears that ... the issue of whether the defendant, by litigating in this Court the present case, has waived the right to demand arbitration should properly be presented in the first instance to the arbitrator\"). The <i>Transamerica</i> court cited to language in <i>Howsam</i> stating that \"the presumption is that the arbitrator should decide `allegation[s] of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.'\" <i>Howsam,</i> 537 U.S. at 84, 123 S.Ct. 588 (quoting <i>Moses H.

Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 336 F.3d 8, 12-14 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Restoration Pres. Masonry, Inc. v. Grove Europe Ltd.,</i> 325 F.3d 54, 60-62 (1st Cir.2003). It has been raised here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start our analysis of whether waiver by conduct in this context is a decision for the court or for the arbitrator by noting that textually under the FAA, a court is only permitted to stay a court action pending arbitration if \"the applicant for the stay is not in <i>default</i> in proceeding with such arbitration.\" 9 U.S.C. &#167; 3 (emphasis added). A \"default\" has generally been viewed by courts as including a \"waiver.\" <i>See, e.g., Patten Grading &amp; Paving, Inc. v. Skanska USA Building, Inc.,</i> 380 F.3d 200, 204-05 (4th Cir.2004); <i>Ivax Corp. v. B. Braun of Am., Inc.,</i> 286 F.3d 1309, 1316 n. 17 (11th Cir.2002); <i>MicroStrategy, Inc. v. Lauricia,</i> 268 F.3d 244, 249 (4th Cir.2001); <i>County of Middlesex v. Gevyn Constr. Corp.,</i> 450 F.2d 53, 56 n. 2 (1st Cir.1971) (only waiver due to the pursuit of legal remedy inconsistent with arbitration is a \"default\" under 9 U.S.C. &#167; 3). This language would seem to place a statutory command on courts, in cases where a stay is sought, to decide the waiver issue themselves. It is true that the same language does not appear in section 4, the section dealing with attempts to compel arbitration, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 4, but the Supreme Court has cautioned us to interpret sections 3 and 4 of the FAA together. <i>See Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.,</i> 388 U.S. 395, 403-04, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967); <i>see also Doctor's Assocs., Inc. v. Distajo,</i> 66 F.3d 438, 456-57 (2d Cir.1995). At any rate, Allied is moving for a stay of Marie's lawsuit against it under section 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Howsam</i> also relies heavily on the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act of 2000 (\"RUAA\"). The RUAA, in turn, as quoted by the <i>Howsam</i> Court, establishes that procedural issues are generally for the arbitrator and substantive issues generally for the court. <i>See</i> RUAA &#167; 6, cmt. 2, 7 U.L.A. 14-15 (Supp.2004). Another comment in the same section of the RUAA treats waiver as an issue for the court: \"Waiver is one area where courts, rather than arbitrators, often make the decision as to enforceability of an arbitration clause.\" RUAA &#167; 6, cmt. 5, 7 U.L.A. 16 (Supp.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As expressed in the commentary to the RUAA and elsewhere, there are important policy reasons why a court and not an arbitrator should decide waiver issues, at least where the waiver &#8212; as has generally been true in our cases &#8212; is due to litigation-related activity. Where the alleged waiver arises out of conduct within the very same litigation in which the party attempts to compel arbitration or stay proceedings, then the district court has power to control the course of proceedings before it and to correct abuses of those proceedings. <i>See Jones Motor Co.,</i> 671 F.2d at 43; <i>Doctor's Assocs.,</i> 66 F.3d at 456 &amp; n. 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, the comparative expertise considerations stressed in <i>Howsam</i> and <i>Green Tree</i> argue for judges to decide this issue. <i>See Howsam,</i> 537 U.S. at 85, 123 S.Ct. 588; <i>Green Tree,</i> 539 U.S. at 452-53, 123 S.Ct. 2402. Judges are well-trained to recognize abusive forum shopping. <i>See Tristar,</i> 97 Fed. Appx. at 464; <i>Bell v. Cendant Corp.,</i> 293 F.3d 563, 569 (2d. Cir.2002); <i>Jones Motor Co.,</i> 671 F.2d at 43. As well, the inquiry heavily implicates \"<i>judicial</i> procedures,\" which <i>Green Tree</i> suggests should be an important factor in presuming that an issue is for the court. <i>See Green Tree,</i> 539 U.S. at 452-53, 123 S.Ct. 2402 (emphasis added). Further, the procedural waiver issue is not likely to be intertwined with the merits of the dispute. <i>See</i> RUAA &#167; 6 cmt. 5, 7 U.L.A. 16 (Supp.2004); <i>see also Wiley,</i> 376 U.S. at 557-58, 84 S.Ct. 909; <i>Prima Paint Corp.,</i> 388 U.S. at 403-04, 87 S.Ct. 1801.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, sending waiver claims to the arbitrator would be exceptionally inefficient. A waiver defense is raised by one party to a lawsuit in response to another party's motion to compel arbitration or stay judicial proceedings on the basis of an arbitration agreement signed by the parties. If the arbitrator were to find that the defendant had waived its right to arbitrate, then the case would inevitably end up back before the district court with the plaintiff again pressing his claims. The case would have bounced back and forth between tribunals without making any progress. <i>See</i> 2 I.R. Macneil et al., <i>Federal Arbitration Law</i> &#167; 21.3 (1994); RUAA &#167; 6 cmt. 5, 7 U.L.A. 16 (Supp.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is different in kind from the arbitrator's normal resolution of a gateway issue: normally, the resolution of such an issue would bar not only arbitration but any sort of litigation on the issues by either side. Thus, allowing courts to decide waiver issues &#8212; at least when due to litigation-related activity &#8212; furthers a key purpose of the FAA: to permit speedy resolution of disputes. <i>See, e.g., Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd,</i> 470 U.S. 213, 218-20, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985); <i>Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp.,</i> 460 U.S. at 22-23, 103 S.Ct. 927; <i>see also Menorah Ins. Co.,</i> 72 F.3d at 222 (observing in context of international, non-FAA arbitration case that \"[a]rbitration clauses were not meant to be another weapon in the arsenal for imposing delay and costs in the dispute resolution process\"). Moreover, the <i>Howsam</i> and <i>Green Tree</i> rules exist partly \"to avoid ... delay.\" <i>Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc.,</i> 321 F.3d at 255. We hold that the Supreme Court in <i>Howsam</i> and <i>Green Tree</i> did not intend to disturb the traditional rule that waiver by conduct, at least where due to litigation-related activity, is presumptively an issue for the court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The waiver here is somewhat unusual in that the claim is of litigation activity before the EEOC that is inconsistent with a right to arbitrate, as opposed to activity before a court. But this makes no difference. Courts are still well suited to determine the sort of forum-shopping and procedural issues that are likely to arise in litigation before the EEOC, and sending the waiver issue to the arbitrator would still be inefficient. The proper presumption in this case is that the waiver issue is for the court and not the arbitrator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied, seeking reversal on any available ground, argues that this presumption is overcome because of specific language in the arbitration agreement. There is no merit to Allied's contention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> A shifting of the issue to the arbitrator will only be found where there is \"clear and unmistakable evidence\" of such an intent in the arbitration agreement. No such evidence exists here. <i>First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan,</i> 514 U.S. 938, 944, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995) (quoting <i>AT &amp; T Techs., Inc. v. Communications Workers of Am.,</i> 475 U.S. 643, 649, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986) (alterations omitted)). The standard in <i>First Options</i> is meant to be a high one, and the normal presumptions in favor of arbitration do not apply. <i>See, e.g., Coady v. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel,</i> 223 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied focuses on the following language in the agreement: \"Employer and employee agree to submit to final and binding arbitration any and all disputes, claims (whether in tort, contract, statutory, or otherwise), and disagreements concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement... <i>including the arbitrability of any such controversy or claim</i>....\" (emphasis added). Specifically, Allied focuses on the clause stating that questions of \"arbitrability\" are for the arbitrator. \"Arbitrability\" itself encompasses a variety of possible meanings, but the most obvious meaning focuses on certain substantive issues, and particularly the question of whether a particular kind of dispute at issue falls within the scope of the arbitration clause. Most cases that discuss arbitrability focus on these substantive issues. <i>See, e.g., First Options,</i> 514 U.S. at 942, 115 S.Ct. 1920; <i>AT &amp; T,</i> 475 U.S. at 645, 106 S.Ct. 1415; <i>Coady,</i> 223 F.3d at 9; <i>see also Johnson v. Polaris Sales, Inc.,</i> 257 F.Supp.2d 300, 308-09 (D.Me.2003) (interpreting \"arbitrability\" language in arbitration agreement to throw issues of substantive scope to the arbitrator); 1 <i>Domke on Commercial Arbitration</i> &#167; 15 (3d ed.2003) (discussing arbitrability question as an issue of the scope of the arbitration agreement). The context of the agreement suggests that this sort of substantive meaning is intended for the term \"arbitrability\" here; the reference to \"arbitrability\" is surrounded by references to which types of claims should be arbitrated and which should not be. We cannot say that the use of the term here evinces a clear and unmistakable intent to have waiver issues decided by the arbitrator. There are no references to waiver or similar terms anywhere in the arbitration agreement. Neither party should be forced to arbitrate the issue of waiver by conduct without a clearer indication in the agreement that they have agreed to do so. The issue of who would decide such a question is an \"arcane\" one that employees are unlikely to have considered unless clearly spelled out by the employer. <i>See First Options,</i> 514 U.S. at 945, 115 S.Ct. 1920.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the question of waiver of Allied's right to arbitrate due to its participation in EEOC proceedings is properly for the judge, and we turn now to the merits of that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B. Waiver due to EEOC proceedings</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marie urges us to find waiver both from the fact that Allied failed to file for arbitration during the pendency of the EEOC investigation and from the fact that it failed to file for arbitration after the EEOC proceeding had concluded with the EEOC's finding of no violation but before Marie had brought her private civil suit in federal district court. At least two elements of waiver by conduct that this circuit has identified are (1) undue delay in bringing arbitration that is inconsistent with the desire to arbitrate and (2) prejudice to the other party from that delay. <i>See Rankin v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 336 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Menorah,</i> 72 F.3d at 221-22. Since, in this case, there was no <i>undue</i> delay, we need not reach the prejudice issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument that waiver occurred during the pendency of the EEOC proceedings runs contrary to circuit precedent. <i>Brennan v. King,</i> 139 F.3d 258, 263-64 (1st Cir.1998), found no waiver where an employer failed to raise its right to arbitrate with the EEOC during the pendency of EEOC proceedings. As well, since <i>Brennan,</i> the Supreme Court has held that an employer cannot stop the EEOC, a third party, from bringing a public enforcement action against an employer by invoking an arbitration agreement between the employer and the relevant employee. <i>See EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc.,</i> 534 U.S. 279, 297-98, 122 S.Ct. 754, 151 L.Ed.2d 755 (2002). The EEOC is a nonparty to the arbitration agreement and therefore cannot be bound by it. <i>See id.</i> at 294, 122 S.Ct. 754. The same logic applies to a preliminary EEOC investigation, which also cannot be halted by an arbitration agreement between the complaining employee and her employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the EEOC's investigation of an employer cannot be stopped by invoking an arbitration agreement, then forcing the employee and employer to begin an arbitration proceeding during the pendency of that investigation will automatically result in two adjudications involving the same issue at the same time: (1) the EEOC investigation of the employer at the employee's urging and (2) the arbitration between the employer and the employee that the employer initiated. This is quite inefficient.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Further, the EEOC investigation might definitively resolve the claim: the employee might receive a notice that the EEOC did not wish to start an enforcement action, along with a rationale for this decision and a right to sue letter, and determine that she did not want to sue after all. That was not Marie's reaction to her letter, but it may well be the reaction of many employees. And if this were the reaction, then there would be no need for employer-employee arbitration at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, forcing employers to bring arbitration during the pendency of EEOC investigations is a waste of resources and is contrary to the general purposes of the FAA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> <i>See, e.g., Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd,</i> 470 U.S. 213, 218-20, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985); <i>Sink</i> v. <i>Aden Enters.,</i> 352 F.3d 1197, 1201 (9th Cir.2003). It is also contrary to the scheme established in the federal employment discrimination statutes, which generally is designed to avoid inefficient, duplicative proceedings. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(f)(1) (employee's private civil lawsuit against employer may only be filed after EEOC has investigated and issued a right to sue letter; no private civil lawsuit may be initiated during the 180-day period allotted for EEOC investigations or after the EEOC has decided to bring a public enforcement action); <i>see also Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,</i> 500 U.S. 20, 27, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991) (explaining similar scheme under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reaffirm that an employer cannot waive its right to arbitration by failing to raise the arbitration defense with the EEOC or by failing to initiate arbitration during the pendency of the EEOC proceedings. The employer's failure to initiate arbitration during the pendency of such proceedings merely reflects a desire to avoid inefficiency and is not action inconsistent with a desire to arbitrate. Our holding here is in accord with the few cases elsewhere to discuss this issue. <i>See, e.g., Brown v. ITT Consumer Fin. Corp.,</i> 211 F.3d 1217, 1222-23 (11th Cir.2000); <i>Gonzalez v. GE Group Adm'rs, Inc.,</i> 321 F.Supp.2d 165, 171-72 (D.Mass.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same considerations apply after an EEOC investigation has concluded with a finding of no violation. We will not force the employer to make a wasteful, preemptive decision to arbitrate when it has no idea whether a dispute will still exist. As the <i>Brown</i> court stated, in general there is no need for the non-complaining party, the employer, to make a \"pre-suit demand for arbitration.\" <i>Brown,</i> 211 F.3d at 1223.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marie has rightly made no claim here that Allied's actions after Marie's lawsuit was filed constitute waiver of Allied's right to arbitrate.

Allied made no attempt to appeal this determination and, more importantly, a denial of a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss is not an appealable interlocutory order. Marie argues that Allied has waived review of the denial of the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings because its initial brief to this court only discussed the motion to dismiss and not the latter motion. This is untrue: while Allied's initial brief did erroneously discuss the order denying the motion to dismiss, it also discussed the denial of the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note that it is very difficult to prevail on a Rule 59(e) motion. The general rule in this circuit is that the moving party must \"either clearly establish a manifest error of law or must present newly discovered evidence.\"<i>Pomerleau v. W. Springfield Pub. Sch.,</i> 362 F.3d 143, 146 n. 2 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>FDIC v. World Univ. Inc.,</i> 978 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir.1992)); <i>see also</i> 11 C.

As well, grants and denials of Rule 59(e) motions are reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <i>See Venegas-Hernandez v. Sonolux Records,</i> 370 F.3d 183, 190 (1st Cir.2004). Allied claimed to have brought its motion because of a manifest error of law made by the district court. Even though Allied may have had little chance of prevailing on its Rule 59(e) motion, the motion still acted to toll the 30-day appeal period.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> There was some question about this at oral argument; in response, Allied submitted a Rule 28(j) letter. The order was dated January 8, 2004, but it was not entered on the docket until January 12, 2004. The docketed date is the one used for purposes of computing filing deadlines<i>See Roque-Rodriguez,</i> 926 F.2d at 106. The ten day limit is unquestionably met from this latter date, given that the day the order is handed down, as well as intermediate weekends and holidays, are not included in the calculation. <i>See id.</i> at 106 n. 5, 107.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Any motion for reconsideration filed after the ten day period does not toll the time period for appealing the underlying order that the party is asking to be reconsidered<i>See, e.g., Lichtenberg,</i> 204 F.3d at 401.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">As well, at least absent some newly available evidence, law, or a new stage of the proceedings, orders denying such motions for reconsideration of an appealable interlocutory order are generally not themselves appealable. <i>See, e.g., Fisichelli v. Town of Methuen,</i> 884 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir.1989) (no appellate jurisdiction over motion to reconsider, raising no newly available facts or arguments, filed one and a half years after denial of original motion for qualified immunity); <i>Cozza v. Network Assocs., Inc.,</i> 362 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.2004) (leaving open question of whether appeals court would have jurisdiction over motion for reconsideration of order denying stay of proceedings and compelling arbitration based on newly available evidence); <i>see also Behrens v.

Such a denial of a motion for reconsideration is not another denial on the merits of the immediately appealable underlying motion. The <i>Fisichelli</i> court stressed that this rule was \"virtually essential to orderly judicial management,\" since interlocutory motions to reconsider are not in the Federal Rules and therefore can be brought at any point in a proceeding, and as many times as a movant wishes. <i>Fisichelli,</i> 884 F.2d at 19. \"[A] dilatory defendant would receive not only his allotted bite at the apple, but an invitation to gnaw at will.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Marie should not have been misled by Allied's notice of appeal, but it is true that her initial brief focused on the jurisdictional issue and touched on the merits only in a single footnote.

The key issue is whether an employer waives its contractual right to compel arbitration of a Title VII claim by not filing for arbitration when the employee initiates an EEOC complaint, but instead waiting and only moving to compel arbitration after the employee later files a civil claim in federal court. We hold here that although the issue of compliance with a contractual time limit should, in the first instance, be addressed by the arbitrator, the issue of waiver of the right to arbitrate due to inconsistent activity in another litigation forum remains an issue for the court even after the <i>Howsam</i> and <i>Green Tree</i> holdings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, on the merits, we hold that an employer does not waive its right to arbitration by failing to demand arbitration during the pendency of an EEOC investigation. This confirms in the light of intervening Supreme Court cases a result this court had reached earlier on different reasoning. <i>See Brennan v. King,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197854\"><a href=\"/opinion/197854/brennan-v-king/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 263-64 (1st Cir.1998). Our reasoning rests in part on <i>EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118475\"><a href=\"/opinion/118475/eeoc-v-waffle-house-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118475\"><a href=\"/opinion/118475/eeoc-v-waffle-house-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In light of <i>Waffle House,</i> a rule forcing the employer to file for arbitration during the pendency of an EEOC investigation would lead to wasteful, duplicative proceedings, and we reject such a result. We hold that the employer in this case has not waived its right to arbitrate the claims at issue. We reverse the decision of the district court refusing to stay judicial proceedings and compel arbitration, and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied Home Mortgage Corporation is a Texas corporation in the business of mortgage banking; it has a branch office in Woburn, Massachusetts. Martha M. Marie began working for Allied's Woburn branch on November 1, 2000 as a mortgage loan processor. Joseph Thompson, a branch manager of Allied's Woburn branch, hired Marie and was her supervisor. He was Marie's boyfriend at the time of her hiring. She was to be compensated by receiving fifty percent of any loan origination fees on all loans she originated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marie alleges that Thompson used \"undue influence, verbal abuse, and threats of physical abuse\" to divert loan origination credit from Marie to Thompson, to force Marie to engage in an \"autodialing\" scheme in violation of The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, 47 U.S.C. &#167; 227, and to force Marie to pay for office supplies out of her own pocket. Marie alleges that Allied knew that some of her origination credit was being diverted from Marie to Thompson and did nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marie also alleges that Thompson threw her out of a stopped car in the winter of 2002 because he was angry with her work. Finally, she alleges that Thompson physically beat Marie in June 2002 both because he was angry with her work and because he thought she was having a sexual affair with another Allied employee. Marie alleges that Thompson wanted her to have sexual relations solely with him. Marie never returned to work after the beating in June &#8212; the company listed her termination date as June 28, 2002. She claims that Allied falsely reported in its personnel records that she voluntarily quit her position. In July 2002, Marie sought and obtained an Abuse Prevention Order from a Massachusetts state court requiring Thompson to stay away from her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Marie was hired by Allied on November 1, 2000, she signed an employment contract that was also signed by Thompson as Allied's representative. This four-page standard-form agreement contained an arbitration clause in Article 5.1. The clause states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Employer and Employee agree to submit to final and binding arbitration any and all disputes, claims (whether in tort, contract, statutory, or otherwise), and disagreements concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement and Employee's employment by Employer and the termination of this Agreement and Employee's employment by Employer including the arbitrability of any such controversy or claim.... Arbitration under this section must be initiated within sixty days of the action, inaction, or occurrence about which the party initiating the arbitration is complaining.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement also stated that any arbitration was to be conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 23, 2003, Marie filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) against Allied and Thompson. The charge alleged sexual discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and applicable state law. The charge, in particular, alleged that during Marie's employment with Allied, Thompson \"physically abused [her] and verbally abused [her] repeatedly because he thought [she] was having a sexual affair with another employee, and Thompson wanted [her] to have sexual relations only with him.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied filed a response to this charge on May 22, 2003. The EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Rights on July 18, 2003, stating that it had concluded its investigation without finding that any violation of Title VII occurred. It stated that the evidence showed that Marie and Thompson lived together and represented themselves as domestic partners; there was no evidence that her \"consensual relationship\" with Thompson was \"unwelcome\" as required to be actionable under Title VII. Also, Thompson's actions were motivated by his personal relationship, not by Marie's gender. Finally, the dismissal noted that Marie did not utilize Allied's existing sexual harassment policy. The dismissal stated that Marie now had a right to sue Thompson or Allied for sexual discrimination in federal or state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 14, 2003, Marie filed a civil complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court, naming Allied and Thompson as defendants; an amended complaint was filed on November 6, 2003. The amended complaint named both Allied and Thompson as defendants for assault and battery and sexual harassment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and named Allied for negligent supervision of Thompson and for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Marie asked for money damages and attorney's fees and costs under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson has never been served; Allied was served on November 20, 2003. Allied removed the action to federal district court in Massachusetts on December 9, 2003. On December 22, Allied filed a demand for arbitration with the AAA, within sixty days of being served. On December 23, 2003, Allied moved to compel arbitration and to stay the court proceedings; the motion was opposed by Marie. This motion was denied on January 8, 2004 (the order was docketed on January 12, 2004), by order stating: \"It being undisputed that the initiation of arbitration proceedings occurred on December 22, 2003, more than sixty days after the conclusion of [the] charge proceedings before the [EEOC], the demand for arbitration is untimely under Article V of plaintiff's employment agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied did not appeal this order but instead, on January 26, 2004, moved to dismiss Marie's complaint as untimely, or, in the alternative, to reconsider the denial of the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). This motion was denied as to each alternative on February 18. The court considered the contract to be one of adhesion and relied upon the rule that an \"ambiguous provision in an adhesion agreement will be strictly construed against the party that wrote it.\" The court also stated that Allied's argument was based on the premise that Marie was required to initiate arbitration within sixty days of the conclusion of the EEOC proceedings if she wanted to pursue her claims, while Allied had six years (the full limitation period for contract actions under Massachusetts law) to demand arbitration. This, the court stated, was inequitable and a \"breathtaking\" reading of the contract. The court, citing <i>Martin v. Norwood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248504\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248504/martin-v-norwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248504\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248504/martin-v-norwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span>, 957-58 (1985), held that Allied, through its delay, had \"waived\" its right to arbitrate the claims and thus the lawsuit would proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's January 12 and February 18 holdings relied on two distinct theories for why arbitration should not be compelled and litigation stayed: (1) Allied's purported failure to comply with the precise 60-day time limit contained in the arbitration provision, as interpreted by the court, and (2) Allied's waiver of its right to arbitrate due to unreasonable delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allied filed a notice of appeal to this court on March 12, 2004. The notice appealed the district court's February 18, 2004 order, \"insofar as such [o]rder denied Allied's motion for reconsideration of the denial of Allied's motion to compel arbitration.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first examine the complex issue of our jurisdiction in this case; Marie argues there is none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, appeals are only permitted from final judgments of the district court. There are a limited number of exceptions. <i>See, e.g., Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112800\"><a href=\"/opinion/112800/puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority-v-metcalf-eddy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 142-43, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112800\"><a href=\"/opinion/112800/puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority-v-metcalf-eddy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span> (1993). A few of these exceptions occur in the arbitration context, as stated in the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). <i>See</i> 9 U.S.C. &#167; 16(a). Appeal may be taken from an interlocutory order of the district court \"refusing a stay of any action\" pending arbitration or \"denying a petition ... to order arbitration to proceed,\" although no appeal may be taken from a district court's granting such a stay or granting a motion to compel arbitration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Id.</i> &#167; 16(a)(1), (b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Allied filed a motion with the district court to stay court proceedings and compel arbitration; both requests were denied and these denials were immediately appealable. But interlocutory appeals, like all other appeals, are governed by the time limitations identified in Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). This provision requires a party to file the notice of appeal within 30 days \"after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\" <i>Id.</i> This timeliness requirement is jurisdictional. <i>See Griggs v.

A waiver defense is raised by one party to a lawsuit in response to another party's motion to compel arbitration or stay judicial proceedings on the basis of an arbitration agreement signed by the parties. If the arbitrator were to find that the defendant had waived its right to arbitrate, then the case would inevitably end up back before the district court with the plaintiff again pressing his claims. The case would have bounced back and forth between tribunals without making any progress. <i>See</i> 2 I.R.

The context of the agreement suggests that this sort of substantive meaning is intended for the term \"arbitrability\" here; the reference to \"arbitrability\" is surrounded by references to which types of claims should be arbitrated and which should not be. We cannot say that the use of the term here evinces a clear and unmistakable intent to have waiver issues decided by the arbitrator. There are no references to waiver or similar terms anywhere in the arbitration agreement. Neither party should be forced to arbitrate the issue of waiver by conduct without a clearer indication in the agreement that they have agreed to do so. The issue of who would decide such a question is an \"arcane\" one that employees are unlikely to have considered unless clearly spelled out by the employer. <i>See First Options,</i> 514 U.S. at 945, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117937\"><a href=\"/opinion/117937/first-options-of-chicago-inc-v-kaplan/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

At least two elements of waiver by conduct that this circuit has identified are (1) undue delay in bringing arbitration that is inconsistent with the desire to arbitrate and (2) prejudice to the other party from that delay. <i>See Rankin v.

As well, since <i>Brennan,</i> the Supreme Court has held that an employer cannot stop the EEOC, a third party, from bringing a public enforcement action against an employer by invoking an arbitration agreement between the employer and the relevant employee. <i>See EEOC v.

This is quite inefficient.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Further, the EEOC investigation might definitively resolve the claim: the employee might receive a notice that the EEOC did not wish to start an enforcement action, along with a rationale for this decision and a right to sue letter, and determine that she did not want to sue after all.
