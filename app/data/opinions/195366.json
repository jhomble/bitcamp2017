Exclusion of Certain Testimony of Henry Moore\n                                                 \n\n          Henry Moore was the first witness at trial.  He was\n\nthe  route  fleet  supervisor  for  the  Herald.    Plaintiff\n\nattempted to  introduce a deposition statement  by Moore that\n\nhe  told Dobbins, after the accident, that the speed at which\n\nDobbins claimed to be going when he entered the intersection,\n\n20-25 miles per hour, was \"excessive or unsafe.\"\n\n          Plaintiff argues strenuously here, as he did below,\n\nthat the  statement was  admissible as a  vicarious admission\n\nagainst the Herald.   There can be no doubt that  the primary\n\npurpose of seeking the admission of the statement was to show\n\nthat Dobbins was travelling at an \"excessive or unsafe\" speed\n\njust before the accident.   This does not make  the statement\n\ninadmissible,  but  it does  add  another  ingredient to  the\n\nadmissibility mix.\n\n          We  reproduce   part   of  the   colloquy   between\n\nplaintiff's  counsel and  the court  on the  admissibility of\n\nMoore's statement:\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n            MR.  ANGUEIRA:    Dobbins' evidence  is\n          that he  was traveling at 20  to 25 miles\n          per hour, and that's what the defendants'\n          experts are  prepared to say, also.   So,\n          assuming that  to be true,  Mr. Moore  as\n          his supervisor --\n\n             THE  COURT:   But Mr.  Moore's opinion\n          that 20 to 25  miles an hour is excessive\n          at  3:40 a.m., whatever  the time may be,\n          is just  a person's opinion.   It isn't a\n          statement of fact binding on a party.\n\n             MR.  ANGUEIRA:    It's  more  than  an\n          opinion, your Honor.   In  this case,  in\n          his   capacity   as   the   route   fleet\n          supervisor    and    engaged    in    his\n          responsibilities  of   meeting  with  the\n          driver  after this accident, he asked Mr.\n          Dobbins  what  happened.    And  in  that\n          capacity,  he  told  his  driver,  as his\n          supervisor, you  were driving excessively\n          and unsafely.   That is a clear admission\n          against  the Boston Herald.   Not against\n          Dobbins.  I agree.   This evidence is not\n          against Dobbins, but  against the  Boston\n          Herald,   I   believe   it's   absolutely\n          admissible.\n\n             THE COURT:  I don't understand that to\n          be the case.  I do not understand how the\n          opinion of a person  who wasn't there and\n          who is  not trained in  deciding what  is\n          excessive and what is not, can be binding\n          on the  corporation.  I don't  see how he\n          was  authorized  to make  that kind  of a\n          statement on behalf of the Herald.\n\n          Whether   Dobbins'   speed   when    entering   the\n\nintersection was \"excessive or unsafe\" was one of the primary\n\nissues that the  jury had to decide.  The  statement by Moore\n\nwas clearly an opinion and not an admission against interest.\n\nRule 701 of the \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence provides: \n\n          Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses\n\n             If the witness is not testifying as an\n          expert,  the  witness'  testimony in  the\n          form of opinions or inferences is limited\n          to those opinions or inferences which are\n          (a) rationally based on the perception of\n          the  witness and (b)  helpful to  a clear\n          understanding  of the  witness' testimony\n          or the determination of a fact in issue.\n\n          Because  Moore  had  not  seen  the  accident,  his\n\nopinion  could   not  have  been  rationally   based  on  his\n\nperception.  As the court pointed out inferentially, if Moore\n\nhad been  an expert on  automobile accidents  and the  speeds\n\nattendant on them, he may have been entitled to testify under\n\nFed.  R.  Evid.  702 and  render  an  opinion  as to  whether\n\nDobbins' speed  was \"excessive or unsafe\" under Fed. R. Evid.\n\n704(a).2    This was  not the  situation before  the district\n\ncourt.   Moore  was  not an  expert  by any  stretch  of  the\n\n                    \n\n2.  Fed. R. Evid. 702 provides:\n             If  scientific,  technical,  or  other\n          specialized  knowledge  will  assist  the\n          trier of fact  to understand the evidence\n          or  to  determine  a  fact  in  issue,  a\n          witness   qualified   as  an   expert  by\n          knowledge,  skill, experience,  training,\n          or education, may testify thereto  in the\n          form of an opinion or otherwise.\n\n    Fed. R. Evid. 704(a) states:\n             Opinion on Ultimate Issue\n             (a) Except as provided  in subdivision\n\n          (b), testimony  in the form of an opinion\n          or inference otherwise admissible  is not\n          objectionable  because   it  embraces  an\n          ultimate issue to be decided by the trier\n          of fact.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nimagination and it would  have been patently unfair  to allow\n\nthe statement in evidence.\n\n          It is important  to note that Moore  was allowed to\n\ntestify that he  told Dobbins,  \"In my opinion  I would  have\n\nslowed down more.\"\n\n          It was neither an abuse of discretion nor error for\n\nthe trial court to exclude Moore's statement.\n\nB.  Exclusion of Questions Directed to Dobbins About\n                                                    \n    a Workmen's Compensation Claim That Dobbins Filed \n                                                     \n    After the Accident\n                      \n\n          Plaintiff made  an offer of proof  to the following\n\neffect.   Defendant Dobbins  filed  a workmen's  compensation\n\nclaim  claiming  that  he   was  injured  in  the  automobile\n\naccident.   Yet on the  morning of the  accident, he reported\n\nfor full-time work at another  job he had at Amtrak.   And he\n\nworked  at  Amtrak  during  the  period  that  his  workmen's\n\ncompensation claim  asserted he  was disabled because  of the\n\nautomobile accident.\n\n          After   hearing  argument   from  counsel   on  the\n\nquestion,  the  court ruled:    \"Engaging in  the  balance of\n\nprobative value and prejudice,  I rule it out on  the grounds\n\nthat the  prejudice outweighs  the probative  value.\"   It is\n\nevident  that the judge's ruling was made pursuant to Fed. R.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nEvid.  403.3   The  standard we  follow  in reviewing  such a\n\ndetermination has been stated as follows:\n\n             The  decision  to  admit   or  exclude\n          evidence  under  Fed.  R.  Evid.  403  is\n          committed  to the broad discretion of the\n          trial  court  and  we  will  reverse  the\n          court's  judgment  only  rarely   and  in\n          extraordinary compelling circumstances\n\nUnited  States v. Brandon, 17  F.3d 409, 443  (1st Cir. 1994)\n                         \n\n(footnote omitted).  \n\n          It  was not an abuse of discretion for the court to\n\nprohibit  questioning   of   Dobbins  about   the   workmen's\n\ncompensation claim he filed. \n\nC)   The Exclusion of Maintenance Records of the Truck\n                                                      \n     and Other Records of its Condition\n                                       \n\n          The  district court excluded maintenance records of\n\nthe truck  and other records of  defective headlights because\n\nthey were too remote in time from the accident.  The accident\n\nhappened  on  September 19,  1991.    The maintenance  record\n\nclosest in time to the accident was July 13, 1991.  The court\n\nfound this  record \"wholly  irrelevant.\"   The  record as  to\n\ndefective headlights was made  on July 13 and  15, 1991.   In\n\nits exclusionary  ruling on  the headlight defects  the court\n\n                    \n\n3.  Fed. R. Evidence 403 provides:\n             Although  relevant,  evidence  may  be\n          excluded  if  its   probative  value   is\n          substantially outweighed by the danger of\n          unfair   prejudice,   confusion  of   the\n          issues,  or  misleading the  jury,  or by\n          considerations of undue  delay, waste  of\n          time,   or   needless   presentation   of\n          cumulative evidence.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nstated:  \"It seems to me that the evidence  of alleged defect\n\nis so  remote in time to the accident, that it would serve no\n\nprobative purpose whatsoever to introduce them.\"\n\n          The court's  rulings did not amount to  an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\nD)   The Failure of the Court to Inform the Jury, \"That\n                                                       \n     it was Entitled to Draw an Adverse Inference from\n                                                      \n     Defendants' Intentional and Improper Disposal of\n                                                     \n     the Herald Truck After the Accident.\"\n                                          \n\n          Plaintiff's statement of the issue and his argument\n\non  it are  based  on  a  false  premise:    that  defendants\n\nintentionally and  improperly disposed of the  truck involved\n\nin the accident.   There is no  such evidence in the  record.\n\nThe  evidence discloses the  following.  No  request was made\n\nuntil  March 10, 1992 by plaintiff that  the truck be held so\n\nthat  it could  be  examined by  plaintiff.   The  truck  was\n\nrepaired  within  thirty days  of  the  accident pursuant  to\n\nDepartment of  Transportation requirements.  After  the truck\n\nwas repaired, it was used again.  There was no court order at\n\nanytime directing  that the truck  be held for  inspection by\n\nplaintiff.   The truck was  sold on  January 22, 1992  by the\n\nlessor.\n\n          On  this state of  the record, there  was no reason\n\nfor the court to give the instruction requested by plaintiff.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n",

In its exclusionary ruling on the headlight defects the court stated:  \"It seems to me that the evidence of alleged defect is so remote in time to the accident, that it would serve no probative purpose whatsoever to introduce them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's rulings did not amount to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D) The Failure of the Court to Inform the Jury, \"That</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">it was Entitled to Draw an Adverse Inference from</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' Intentional and Improper Disposal of</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the Herald Truck After the Accident.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's statement of the issue and his argument on it are based on a false premise:  that defendants intentionally and improperly disposed of the truck involved in the accident.  There is no such evidence in the record.  The evidence discloses the following.  No request was made until March 10, 1992 by plaintiff that the truck be held so that it could be examined by plaintiff.  The truck was repaired within thirty days of the accident pursuant to Department of Transportation requirements.  After the truck was repaired, it was used again.  There was no court order at anytime directing that the truck be held for inspection by plaintiff.  The truck was sold on January 22, 1992 by the lessor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this state of the record, there was no reason for the court to give the instruction requested by plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On the fifth day of trial plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his claim against Lily</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Fed.
