Following trial,  defendants Jose\n          CYR, Circuit Judge.\n                            \n\nHernandez, Aguilino Jose Sanchez,  and Jorge Luis Sostre (herein-\n\nafter, collectively:  \"appellants\")  were convicted and sentenced\n\non various charges arising out of an undercover cocaine  transac-\n\ntion in Providence, Rhode Island.  Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          In February  1991, Rodrigo Sostre  (\"Rodrigo\"), through\n\nan  intermediary, offered to sell  a kilogram of  cocaine to Frdy\n\nVegas, a paid  DEA informant.   While consulting  with his  usual\n\ncocaine  source, one  Luis  Guillermo Santiago-Martinez,  Rodrigo\n\nrepeatedly spoke by telephone with Vegas between February 15  and\n\nFebruary 19, finally  arranging for the drug  transaction to take\n\nplace at Rodrigo's apartment on the afternoon of February 19.  \n\n          At 2:00 p.m.  on February 19,  Rodrigo and his  brother\n\nJorge Luis  Sostre  (\"Jorge\") met  Vegas  and an  undercover  DEA\n\nagent, Anthony Roberto, on the front porch of Rodrigo's apartment\n\nbuilding.    Agent Roberto  asked  Rodrigo  if \"everything  [was]\n\nready,\"  and Rodrigo  responded that  \"the  people were  on their\n\nway.\"  Rodrigo  went upstairs  to his second  floor apartment  to\n\nphone  his  \"source.\"   When he  returned  to the  porch, Rodrigo\n\nstated that the cocaine was of  good quality, and that his neigh-\n\nborhood was a  much safer  place for a  drug transaction  because\n\n                                3\n\nthere  was \"less police activity.\"   Jorge agreed  with his brot-\n\nher's assessment.\n\n          At 2:15  the cocaine had  not yet arrived,  and Rodrigo\n\nreturned to his apartment to make another phone call.  Jorge, who\n\nremained on the front porch with Vegas and Agent Roberto, stated:\n\n\"I don't blame you guys to leave [sic], you've got a lot of money\n\nand  that's a  lot  of merchandise  to  be waiting  around  for.\"\n\nRodrigo returned, informing Vegas and Agent Roberto:  \"they [are]\n\non their way.\"  After a third unsuccessful phone call by Rodrigo,\n\nVegas told  the Sostre  brothers that he  would wait at  a nearby\n\nstore until notified by beeper that the cocaine had arrived.\n\n          In the meantime, DEA agents observed appellants Sanchez\n\nand Hernandez as they  arrived by car at the residence of Santia-\n\ngo-Martinez,  Rodrigo's usual  drug supplier.   Santiago-Martinez\n\nentered the  back seat of  the car, which  then proceeded to  Ro-\n\ndrigo's apartment,  arriving at approximately 2:54.   At approxi-\n\nmately  the  same time,  Vegas's  beeper  was  activated, and  he\n\nreturned with  Agent Roberto to Rodrigo's  apartment house, where\n\nthe Sostre brothers met them on the front porch.  Rodrigo brought\n\nthem  upstairs, while Jorge remained  on the porch.   Once inside\n\nthe  upstairs  apartment,  Rodrigo  locked the  door.    Sanchez,\n\nSantiago-Martinez,  and Hernandez  were inside  the apartment  as\n\nwell, standing  around  a table  upon  which lay  a  one-kilogram\n\npackage  of cocaine which later  tested 94% pure.   Agent Roberto\n\ninquired  in Spanish:   \"Why do you need  three people?\"  Sanchez\n\nresponded in  Spanish:  \"That's  the way I  do business.\"   After\n\n                                4\n\ninspecting  the cocaine,  Agent  Roberto  went  out to  his  car,\n\nostensibly to get  the $28,000 purchase money,  and signalled for\n\nthe  waiting DEA agents  to raid the  apartment.   Just after the\n\nraid commenced, DEA agents saw Jorge walk off the front porch \"in\n\na rapid manner,\" then \"start casually slowing down and walking up\n\nthe sidewalk.\"   Jorge was  arrested, as were  Rodrigo, Santiago-\n\nMartinez, Sanchez, and Hernandez.   Hernandez had a  loaded semi-\n\nautomatic in his possession at the time of his arrest.  The five-\n\ncount  indictment followed,  and  Hernandez,  Sanchez, and  Jorge\n\nSostre were convicted on all charges.1\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nA.   Hernandez' Appeal.\n                      \n\n          Hernandez  challenges the  district court's  refusal to\n\ninstruct  the jury  that he  could not  be convicted  on Count  3\n\n(using or  carrying a firearm  during and in  relation to  a drug\n\n                    \n\n     1The  original indictment  charged  appellants,  along  with\nSantiago-Martinez  and Rodrigo  Sostre, in  two counts:   Count 1\n(conspiracy  to distribute  and to  possess with  intent to  dis-\ntribute, 21 U.S.C.   846) and Count 2 (possession of cocaine with\nintent to  distribute, id.     841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B); 18  U.S.C.  \n                          \n2).  Only Sanchez and Jorge  appeal their convictions on counts 1\nand 2.\n     The indictment charged Hernandez  and Sanchez in two counts:\nCount 3  (using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a\ndrug trafficking offense,  18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1);  id.   2),  and\n                                                      \nCount 4 (possession of  a firearm by an illegal alien, id.   922-\n                                                          \n(g)(5); id.   2).  After trial, Sanchez won a judgment of acquit-\n           \ntal on Count 3.  Hernandez appeals his conviction under Count 3.\n     The  government dismissed Count 4 prior  to trial.  Finally,\nSanchez appeals  his conviction  under Count 5  (possession of  a\nfirearm by a convicted felon, id.   922(g)(1); id.   2).\n                                                  \n\n                                5\n\ntrafficking offense, 18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1)) for \"mere possession\"\n\nof a firearm, but  that the government was required to prove that\n\nthe  firearm was an  \"integral part\" of the  offense, or that his\n\npossession of it was made known to others present during the drug\n                               \n\ntransaction.2  These arguments are without merit.\n\n          The  challenged  instruction recited  the corresponding\n\nprinciples that a  conviction under section  924(c) would not  be\n\nwarranted for \"mere possession,\" and that the jury must find that\n\nthe  firearm \"facilitated\"  the crime.3   As  the district  court\n\nsuggested,  the  \"facilitation\" element  of section  924(c) would\n\ndepend on whether Hernandez' intent was reasonably inferable from\n\nthe  totality  of the  circumstances, which  is  \"a matter  for a\n\n[trier of fact]  applying common sense  theories of human  nature\n\nand  causation.\"  United States  v. Plummer, 964  F.2d 1251, 1255\n                                           \n\n                    \n\n     2Hernandez'  proposed instruction provided, in its entirety:\n\"Possession  of a  firearm  constitutes use  in relation  to drug\ntrafficking  offense if possession is [sic] integral part of, and\nfacilitates commission of, drug trafficking offense.\"\n\n     3The jury was instructed that:\n\n     The term \"used or  carried a firearm\" includes the  act\n     of carrying,  wearing, or using a  firearm. The firearm\n     must be within the Defendant's reach at the time of the\n     offense. Mere possession of a firearm is not sufficient\n     proof. The government must prove the firearm facilitat-\n     ed the drug-trafficking crime. To facilitate is a [sic]\n     crime does not require actual  use of a firearm. Howev-\n     er,  a Defendant may  not be convicted  of this offense\n     unless the  jury finds  beyond a reasonable  doubt from\n     the circumstances, the  Defendant intended  to use  the\n                                                       \n     firearm  if a  contingency arose  potentially requiring\n     its use or  that the  Defendant intended to  use it  to\n     possibly facilitate escape should the need arise.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n                                6\n\n(1st Cir.) (quoting United  States v. Wilkinson, 926 F.2d  22, 26\n                                               \n\n(1st Cir.1991)), cert. denied,  113 S. Ct. 350 (1992).  Given the\n                             \n\n$28,000 in cash being  exchanged for the kilogram of  cocaine, as\n\nwell  as Hernandez' proximity to  the cocaine during the exchange\n\nand the  fact that there was a bullet  in the chamber of the gun,\n\nthe challenged instruction provided adequate guidance on \"facili-\n\ntation.\"\n\n          As  to Hernandez' second contention, it is simply not a\n\ncorrect statement of the law that the presence of a  firearm used\n\nto  \"facilitate\" a drug trafficking offense need be made known to\n\nother  participants in  the transaction.

On review of a district court ruling under Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n29, we evaluate the evidence, draw all reasonable inferences, and\n\nresolve all  credibility determinations in the  light most favor-\n\nable to  the government. United  States v.  Yefsky, No.  90-1174,\n                                                  \n\nslip  op. at 6 (1st Cir. May     , 1992); United States v. Wight,\n                                                                \n\n968 F.2d 1393, 1395 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Our review satisfies us that the jury supportably could\n\nhave  found,  beyond a  reasonable  doubt, that  Sanchez  was the\n\nindividual who transported the  cocaine to Rodrigo's apartment on\n\nFebruary  19, 1991.   Vegas  and Agent  Roberto  had asked  to be\n\nsummoned by  beeper as soon  as the  cocaine arrived.   They were\n\nsummoned at  approximately the same  time Sanchez arrived  at the\n\napartment, giving rise to a reasonable inference that Sanchez was\n\nthe \"source,\" or that a person \"in charge\" of the transaction had\n\nfinally  arrived.4  Moreover,  inside the apartment,  it was San-\n\n                    \n\n     4The record provides no  direct support for the government's\ncontention that the beeper was activated  at precisely 2:55 p.m.,\ni.e., one minute following Sanchez' and Hernandez' arrival at the\n    \ncrime  scene.  We note, however, that Agent Roberto merely testi-\nfied that  the beeper  signal came  at \"approximately 2:50,\"  and\n                                                     \n\n                                9\n\nchez who advised Agent Roberto:  \"That's the way I do  business.\"\n\nIn  the circumstances  revealed by  the evidence,  this admission\n\nwould support a jury determination that Sanchez not only partici-\n\npated  in  the transaction  but was  in  charge of  supplying the\n\ncocaine to Rodrigo for sale to Roberto.5\n\n          In  an effort  to negate  the latter  evidence, Sanchez\n\ncontends  that, without  his alleged  incriminatory  statement to\n\nAgent  Roberto,  the government  would  not  have had  sufficient\n\nevidence to convict.   Citing two allegedly erroneous evidentiary\n\nrulings,  Sanchez  argues  that  the  district  court  improperly\n\nrestricted  his defense,  by which  he sought  to establish  that\n\nAgent  Roberto was  less  than fluent  in  Spanish and  may  have\n\nmistranslated  Sanchez' Spanish  statement  into  English  during\n\ndirect examination at trial.6\n\n                    \n\nVegas and Roberto, who  were waiting at a nearby  store, returned\nto Rodrigo's apartment at 2:58.\n\n     5Sanchez  argues  that   Santiago-Martinez  testified   that\nSanchez  did not  make this  comment to  Agent  Roberto.   To the\nextent this  alleged conflict in testimony  necessitated a credi-\nbility determination, we must presume the jury found Roberto more\ncredible.   Furthermore,  Santiago-Martinez'  testimony could  be\nunderstood  as indicating  his  lack of  recollection (\"I  wasn't\npaying attention\"), rather than  as stating that no  such comment\nwas made.\n\n     6Roberto, a DEA  agent since the early 1980s, testified that\nhe had taken a  four-month Spanish course in 1984,  was stationed\nin Monterey, Mexico from 1984 through 1986,  attended an advanced\nSpanish course in 1986, and used his Spanish language  experience\ndaily as a  DEA agent.  Sanchez does not  appear to challenge the\noriginal admission  of Roberto's interpretive testimony, to which\ndefense counsel raised  no objection at  trial.  Accordingly,  we\ndeem the issue waived.  He merely argues that he should have been\nallowed more opportunity to impeach Roberto on  cross-examination\nand on rebuttal.\n\n                                10\n\n          The trial court has broad discretion over the scope and\n\nextent of cross-examination. United  States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1446, 1457 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v.  Berrio-Londono, 946\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  158, 160  (1st Cir.  1991), cert. denied,  112 S.  Ct. 1223\n                                              \n\n(1992).  Sanchez contends  that the district court cut  short his\n\ncross-examination  of Agent  Roberto  concerning his  proficiency\n\nwith the Spanish language.  We do not agree.  Out of  the hearing\n\nof the jury,  the district court merely questioned  the relevancy\n\nof defense counsel's line of  questioning, which had become mired\n\nin  minute  detail concerning  the  identity  of Agent  Roberto's\n\nneighbors while he was  residing in Monterey during 1986.   At no\n\ntime  did the court prohibit defense  counsel from continuing the\n\nline of questioning, nor does the record reflect any objection to\n\nthe  district court's  statements.   In fact,  when the  jury was\n\nreturned  to the  courtroom,  defense counsel  posed a  follow-up\n\nquestion along the same line.  There was no error.\n\n          Sanchez also  claims that his Sixth  Amendment right to\n\nconfrontation was violated by the court's refusal to allow him to\n\ncall the person who was serving as the court-appointed interpret-\n\ner during  Agent Roberto's  direct examination.7   Sanchez argues\n\n                    \n     7The court explained its ruling as follows:\n\n     I was advised yesterday afternoon that the  Interpreter\n     whom we had here  yesterday afternoon had been told  to\n     appear here today to  testify.  I advised, I  sent work\n     [sic] to him  that he was  not to come  here today.   I\n                                                            \n     can't for the  life of  me understand why  he would  be\n                                                            \n     asked to testify  in the  first place.   In the  second\n                                           \n     place, I'm not  going to  permit someone  to come  into\n     this courtroom,  and in  front  of the  jury  interpret\n     testimony and then put that  same person on the witness\n     stand to give  opinion testimony as to one's control of\n\n                                11\n\nthat the interpreter could have testified that Roberto's transla-\n\ntion of Sanchez' incriminatory  statement was unreliable, or that\n\nSanchez'  statement  was  susceptible  to  a  less  incriminating\n\nEnglish rendition.  However,  defense counsel neither objected to\n\nthe  district court's exclusionary  ruling nor  made an  offer of\n\nproof  pursuant  to Fed.  R.  Evid.  103(d), notwithstanding  the\n\ncourt's express statement that  it could not understand  \"why the\n\n[interpreter] would be asked to testify in the first place.\"  See\n                                                                 \n\nsupra note 7.  Accordingly, we review for \"plain error\" affecting\n     \n\nthe  \"fundamental  fairness\" of  the trial.     United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nTracy, Nos. 92-1459, 92-1461, 92-1554, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 6245,\n     \n\nat 12 (1st Cir. Mar. 29, 1993); United States v. McGill, 952 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n16, 18 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          Sanchez argues that the interpreter's testimony was the\n\nonly practicable way to convey to a non-Spanish-speaking jury the\n\nuntrustworthiness of Agent Roberto's testimony.  Even discounting\n\ndefense counsel's unexplained failure to come forward with either\n\nan objection or the \"invited\" offer of proof, cf. Hernandez-Garza\n                                                                 \n\nv.

That's vouching in the  highest\n     order.  Anything else?\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n                                12\n\ninterpreter was  present\"),8 Sanchez does not explain  why it was\n\nnecessary that the court-appointed interpreter  testify, particu-\n\nlarly in  light of the  district court's  plainly stated  concern\n\nthat the interpreter might be placed in the position of appearing\n\nto  vouch for or against a translation previously rendered in his\n\nrole as court-appointed interpreter.  Agent Roberto's proficiency\n\nin Spanish could as  well have been tested  on cross-examination9\n\nor  through an  interpreter selected  by  the defense,  as indeed\n\ncould  other  possible  translations  of  Sanchez'  incriminating\n\nremark.  Therefore, even if defense counsel believed the district\n\ncourt was adamantly opposed to calling the court-appointed inter-\n\npreter,  there was no apparent reason  for neither explaining the\n\ndefense's  position nor  requesting  a continuance  to obtain  an\n\ninterpreter.  Finally, since  Sanchez has never suggested another\n\nEnglish  translation of  the incriminating  statement, there  has\n\nbeen no showing of plain error.\n\n     2.   Evidence of Constructive\n\n                    \n\n     8At oral  argument, Sanchez' counsel explained  that not all\nobjections can be  made in \"the heat  of trial.\"  Yet  it is pre-\ncisely in the \"heat of  trial\" that counsel's timely articulation\nof grounds for proposing or opposing the admission of evidence is\nmost  important to  the  trial court.   Similarly,  \"[i]f lawyers\ncould  pursue on appeal  issues not properly  raised below, there\nwould  be little incentive to get it  right the first time and no\nend of  retrials.\"  Poliquin  v. Garden Way, Inc.,      F.2d    ,\n                                                 \n    (1st Cir. 1993)  [Nos. 92-1115, 92-1116,  slip op. at 8  (1st\nCir. Mar. 24, 1993)].\n\n     9Indeed,  during  his  extended  cross-examination  of Agent\nRoberto, Sanchez' counsel was allowed great latitude, and engaged\nRoberto in a prolonged exercise in which he asked Roberto to give\nSpanish-English and English-Spanish translations for a series  of\ncommon expressions.\n\n                                13\n\n          Possession of Firearm. \n          Possession of Firearm.\n                               \n\n          Sanchez argues that he could  not be convicted on Count\n\n5 (transportation of a firearm by a convicted  felon, 18 U.S.C.  \n\n922(g)(1))  for \"constructive  possession\" of  Hernandez' firearm\n\nbecause the government introduced no direct evidence that Sanchez\n                                           \n\nknew that Hernandez was  carrying it.  Sanchez' argument  depends\n    \n\nprimarily  on his  unsuccessful attempt  to undermine  Agent Rob-\n\nerto's  testimony concerning the  incriminating statement Sanchez\n\nmade on February 19, 1991.  The government points out  that since\n\nSanchez proclaimed  that he  was in charge  of the drug  deal, he\n\ncould  be found  to have  \"controlled\" Hernandez.   A  reasonable\n\ninference  could then be drawn  that Hernandez was  there at San-\n\nchez' behest to protect the drugs, and Sanchez.  \"[A]s  long as a\n\nconvicted  felon knowingly has the  power and the  intention at a\n\ngiven  time of  exercising dominion  and control over  a firearm,\n\n. . . directly or through others, he is in [constructive] posses-\n                                \n\nsion of  the firearm.\"   United States v.  Wight, 968  F.2d 1393,\n                                                \n\n1398  (1st Cir. 1992) (emphasis added); see also United States v.\n                                                              \n\nMcAnderson, 914 F.2d 934,  947-48 (7th Cir. 1990).   The evidence\n          \n\nwas sufficient to  establish Sanchez' constructive  possession of\n\nthe firearm carried by Hernandez.  \n\n     3.   Entrapment Defense. \n     3.   Entrapment Defense\n                            \n\n          Sanchez contends that he  was entitled to an entrapment\n\ninstruction.   Since there  was no  post-charge objection  to the\n\nrefusal to give an entrapment instruction, however, we review for\n\nplain  error.  See United States v. Arias-Santana, 964 F.2d 1262,\n                                                 \n\n                                14\n\n1268  (1st Cir.  1992)  (citing Fed.  R.  Crim. P.  52(b),  which\n\nmandates renewed  objection after court's charge  and before jury\n\nretires to deliberate).\n\n          The entrapment defense consists of two components:  (1)\n\ngovernment inducement of the crime, and (2) an absence of predis-\n\nposition  on  the part  of the  defendant  to commit  the alleged\n\ncrime.   United States v. Reed, 977  F.2d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 1992);\n                              \n\nUnited  States  v. Tejeda,  974 F.2d  210,  217 (1st  Cir. 1992).\n                         \n\nSanchez contends that the  district court improperly required him\n\nto produce evidence of lack of predisposition, whereas the burden\n\nof  production should  have shifted  to the  government to  prove\n\npredisposition  once  Sanchez established  government inducement.\n\nThe argument is irreparably flawed in at least two respects.\n\n          First, Sanchez was entitled  to an entrapment  instruc-\n\ntion  only if he first  produced \"some evidence\"     on both ele-\n                                                            \n\nments  of the entrapment defense    sufficient to raise a reason-\n\nable doubt as to whether he \"was an 'unwary innocent' rather than\n\nan 'unwary  criminal.'\"  Id.  (quoting Mathews v.  United States,\n                                                                \n\n485 U.S. 58, 63 (1988)).  Second, Sanchez produced no evidence of\n\ngovernment inducement.   Before he  arrived at the  scene of  the\n\ndrug  transaction on  February 19,  1991, Sanchez  had no  direct\n\ncontact  with any government agent.   \"[T]his court [has] refused\n\nto extend the entrapment  defense to a defendant in  contact only\n                                                                 \n\nwith  an intermediary,  and not  the government agent,  absent 'a\n                     \n\nshowing that pressure had  been put upon him by  the intermediary\n\nat the instruction of  the government agent.'\"  United  States v.\n                                                              \n\n                                15\n\nMurphy, 852 F.2d  1, 6 (1st Cir. 1988)  (quoting United States v.\n                                                              \n\nBradley, 820 F.2d 3,  8 (1st Cir. 1987)) (emphasis  added), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied,  489 U.S. 1022 (1989); see also United States v.

Sanchez  does not suggest,\n\nnor does the record disclose any evidence, that government agents\n\neven knew about Sanchez  or his involvement in the  offense prior\n\nto his arrival at the scene of the undercover drug buy, let alone\n\nthat agents instructed  anyone to pressure Sanchez to  take part.\n\nAbsent  any evidence  of government  inducement, Sanchez  was not\n\nentitled  to a jury charge on entrapment, and the court committed\n\nno error, plain or otherwise.\n\n     4.   Refusal to Depart. \n     4.   Refusal to Depart\n                           \n\n          Finally,  citing 18  U.S.C.    3553  (\"The court  shall\n\nimpose  a sentence  sufficient,  but not  greater than  necessary\n                                                                 \n\n. . . .\") (emphasis added), Sanchez says the district court erred\n\nin refusing to depart below the \"excessive\" thirty-year guideline\n\nsentence to reflect Sanchez' \"minimal\" role in the offense.  Even\n\naccepting Sanchez'  characterization of his role  in the offense,\n\nthe refusal to depart is not reviewable unless the district court\n\nmistakenly believed it  lacked the authority  to depart.   United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

As the district\n                        \n\ncourt  was  fully cognizant  of  its  authority, we  are  without\n\njurisdiction to consider Sanchez' guideline sentencing appeal.\n\n                                16\n\nC.   Jorge's Appeal. \n                   \n\n          Jorge Sostre claims that his convictions under Count 1 \n\n(conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent  to distrib-\n\nute, 21  U.S.C.   846)  and Count 2  (possession of cocaine  with\n\nintent to distribute, id.    841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B); 18 U.S.C.   2)\n                         \n\nwere  based solely on his \"mere  presence\" in the vicinity of the\n\ndrug transaction.   Jorge contends  that he  was simply  visiting\n\nbrother Rodrigo's  apartment, and  that the casual  statements he\n\nmade to Vegas  and Agent Roberto, though  arguably indicating his\n\ngeneral  awareness of the drug transaction, were far too vague to\n\nestablish his active participation.   Jorge says the government's\n\ncharacterization  of him  as  a \"lookout\"  is unsupported  by the\n\nevidence, which  shows  that  the front  door  of  the  apartment\n\nbuilding was left open  during the drug transaction, and  that he\n\nnever made any attempt to signal  or warn the others when the DEA\n\nraid began. As  to his  constructive possession  of the  cocaine,\n\nJorge argues that there is  no evidence he ever had access  to it\n\nor power over it.\n\n          We again view all evidence in the light most  favorable\n\nto the government,  Wight, 968 F.2d  at 1395, while  at the  same\n                         \n\ntime recognizing that \"'the line that separates mere presence [at\n\nthe site of a drug offense] from culpable presence is a thin one,\n\ndifficult  to plot,'\" United  States v.  O'Campo, 973  F.2d 1015,\n                                                \n\n1020  (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting  United States v.  Ortiz, 966 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n707 (1st Cir. 1992)).  In this case, however, we believe that the\n\nevidence, as  a whole,  adequately supported the  conclusion that\n\n                                17\n\nJorge  knowingly remained  on the front  porch to  facilitate the\n\nprearranged drug transaction.\n\n          First, Jorge's presence during  Rodrigo's incriminating\n\nconversations with  Vegas and Agent Roberto,  his apparent agree-\n\nment with his brother's assessments concerning the quality of the\n\ncocaine and the low level of police activity in the neighborhood,\n\nand  his later  statements about  the \"money\"  and \"merchandise,\"\n\nprovided  firm support for an  inference that Jorge  knew that an\n\nillegal drug transaction was about to occur.\n\n          Second, \"jurors are  neither required to divorce  them-\n\nselves from their  common sense  nor to abandon  the dictates  of\n\nmature experience,\"  which reasonably may  include their recogni-\n\ntion that \"criminals rarely welcome innocent persons as witnesses\n\nto serious crimes.\"  Cf. Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 712; United States v.\n                                                              \n\nBatista-Polanco,  927 F.2d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 1991).  Jorge did not\n               \n\nreside at the apartment where the  drug transaction occurred, nor\n\nwas  he  a captive  of  the  circumstances.   Although  appellate\n\ncounsel  suggested  the possibility  that  Jorge's  visit to  his\n\nbrother's  apartment may  have  been occasioned  by the  innocent\n\nimpulse to promote  their filial bond, the  jury reasonably could\n\nconclude that an innocent person, with knowledge of  an impending\n\ndrug transaction, would not linger outside for  over an hour on a\n\nwinter  day in a location  which afforded him  an obvious vantage\n\npoint from  which to observe the surrounding neighborhood as well\n\nas the ingress to the site of  the drug deal.

Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          In February  1991, Rodrigo Sostre  (\"Rodrigo\"), through\n\nan  intermediary, offered to sell  a kilogram of  cocaine to Frdy\n\nVegas, a paid  DEA informant.   While consulting  with his  usual\n\ncocaine  source, one  Luis  Guillermo Santiago-Martinez,  Rodrigo\n\nrepeatedly spoke by telephone with Vegas between February 15  and\n\nFebruary 19, finally  arranging for the drug  transaction to take\n\nplace at Rodrigo's apartment on the afternoon of February 19.  \n\n          At 2:00 p.m.  on February 19,  Rodrigo and his  brother\n\nJorge Luis  Sostre  (\"Jorge\") met  Vegas  and an  undercover  DEA\n\nagent, Anthony Roberto, on the front porch of Rodrigo's apartment\n\nbuilding.    Agent Roberto  asked  Rodrigo  if \"everything  [was]\n\nready,\"  and Rodrigo  responded that  \"the  people were  on their\n\nway.\"  Rodrigo  went upstairs  to his second  floor apartment  to\n\nphone  his  \"source.\"   When he  returned  to the  porch, Rodrigo\n\nstated that the cocaine was of  good quality, and that his neigh-\n\nborhood was a  much safer  place for a  drug transaction  because\n\n                                3\n\nthere  was \"less police activity.\"   Jorge agreed  with his brot-\n\nher's assessment.\n\n          At 2:15  the cocaine had  not yet arrived,  and Rodrigo\n\nreturned to his apartment to make another phone call.  Jorge, who\n\nremained on the front porch with Vegas and Agent Roberto, stated:\n\n\"I don't blame you guys to leave [sic], you've got a lot of money\n\nand  that's a  lot  of merchandise  to  be waiting  around  for.\"\n\nRodrigo returned, informing Vegas and Agent Roberto:  \"they [are]\n\non their way.\"  After a third unsuccessful phone call by Rodrigo,\n\nVegas told  the Sostre  brothers that he  would wait at  a nearby\n\nstore until notified by beeper that the cocaine had arrived.\n\n          In the meantime, DEA agents observed appellants Sanchez\n\nand Hernandez as they  arrived by car at the residence of Santia-\n\ngo-Martinez,  Rodrigo's usual  drug supplier.   Santiago-Martinez\n\nentered the  back seat of  the car, which  then proceeded to  Ro-\n\ndrigo's apartment,  arriving at approximately 2:54.   At approxi-\n\nmately  the  same time,  Vegas's  beeper  was  activated, and  he\n\nreturned with  Agent Roberto to Rodrigo's  apartment house, where\n\nthe Sostre brothers met them on the front porch.  Rodrigo brought\n\nthem  upstairs, while Jorge remained  on the porch.   Once inside\n\nthe  upstairs  apartment,  Rodrigo  locked the  door.    Sanchez,\n\nSantiago-Martinez,  and Hernandez  were inside  the apartment  as\n\nwell, standing  around  a table  upon  which lay  a  one-kilogram\n\npackage  of cocaine which later  tested 94% pure.   Agent Roberto\n\ninquired  in Spanish:   \"Why do you need  three people?\"  Sanchez\n\nresponded in  Spanish:  \"That's  the way I  do business.\"   After\n\n                                4\n\ninspecting  the cocaine,  Agent  Roberto  went  out to  his  car,\n\nostensibly to get  the $28,000 purchase money,  and signalled for\n\nthe  waiting DEA agents  to raid the  apartment.   Just after the\n\nraid commenced, DEA agents saw Jorge walk off the front porch \"in\n\na rapid manner,\" then \"start casually slowing down and walking up\n\nthe sidewalk.\"   Jorge was  arrested, as were  Rodrigo, Santiago-\n\nMartinez, Sanchez, and Hernandez.   Hernandez had a  loaded semi-\n\nautomatic in his possession at the time of his arrest.  The five-\n\ncount  indictment followed,  and  Hernandez,  Sanchez, and  Jorge\n\nSostre were convicted on all charges.1\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nA.   Hernandez' Appeal.\n                      \n\n          Hernandez  challenges the  district court's  refusal to\n\ninstruct  the jury  that he  could not  be convicted  on Count  3\n\n(using or  carrying a firearm  during and in  relation to  a drug\n\n                    \n\n     1The  original indictment  charged  appellants,  along  with\nSantiago-Martinez  and Rodrigo  Sostre, in  two counts:   Count 1\n(conspiracy  to distribute  and to  possess with  intent to  dis-\ntribute, 21 U.S.C.   846) and Count 2 (possession of cocaine with\nintent to  distribute, id.     841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B); 18  U.S.C.  \n                          \n2).  Only Sanchez and Jorge  appeal their convictions on counts 1\nand 2.\n     The indictment charged Hernandez  and Sanchez in two counts:\nCount 3  (using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a\ndrug trafficking offense,  18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1);  id.   2),  and\n                                                      \nCount 4 (possession of  a firearm by an illegal alien, id.   922-\n                                                          \n(g)(5); id.   2).  After trial, Sanchez won a judgment of acquit-\n           \ntal on Count 3.  Hernandez appeals his conviction under Count 3.\n     The  government dismissed Count 4 prior  to trial.  Finally,\nSanchez appeals  his conviction  under Count 5  (possession of  a\nfirearm by a convicted felon, id.   922(g)(1); id.   2).\n                                                  \n\n                                5\n\ntrafficking offense, 18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1)) for \"mere possession\"\n\nof a firearm, but  that the government was required to prove that\n\nthe  firearm was an  \"integral part\" of the  offense, or that his\n\npossession of it was made known to others present during the drug\n                               \n\ntransaction.2  These arguments are without merit.\n\n          The  challenged  instruction recited  the corresponding\n\nprinciples that a  conviction under section  924(c) would not  be\n\nwarranted for \"mere possession,\" and that the jury must find that\n\nthe  firearm \"facilitated\"  the crime.3   As  the district  court\n\nsuggested,  the  \"facilitation\" element  of section  924(c) would\n\ndepend on whether Hernandez' intent was reasonably inferable from\n\nthe  totality  of the  circumstances, which  is  \"a matter  for a\n\n[trier of fact]  applying common sense  theories of human  nature\n\nand  causation.\"  United States  v.

Vegas  and Agent  Roberto  had asked  to be\n\nsummoned by  beeper as soon  as the  cocaine arrived.   They were\n\nsummoned at  approximately the same  time Sanchez arrived  at the\n\napartment, giving rise to a reasonable inference that Sanchez was\n\nthe \"source,\" or that a person \"in charge\" of the transaction had\n\nfinally  arrived.4  Moreover,  inside the apartment,  it was San-\n\n                    \n\n     4The record provides no  direct support for the government's\ncontention that the beeper was activated  at precisely 2:55 p.m.,\ni.e., one minute following Sanchez' and Hernandez' arrival at the\n    \ncrime  scene.  We note, however, that Agent Roberto merely testi-\nfied that  the beeper  signal came  at \"approximately 2:50,\"  and\n                                                     \n\n                                9\n\nchez who advised Agent Roberto:  \"That's the way I do  business.\"\n\nIn  the circumstances  revealed by  the evidence,  this admission\n\nwould support a jury determination that Sanchez not only partici-\n\npated  in  the transaction  but was  in  charge of  supplying the\n\ncocaine to Rodrigo for sale to Roberto.5\n\n          In  an effort  to negate  the latter  evidence, Sanchez\n\ncontends  that, without  his alleged  incriminatory  statement to\n\nAgent  Roberto,  the government  would  not  have had  sufficient\n\nevidence to convict.   Citing two allegedly erroneous evidentiary\n\nrulings,  Sanchez  argues  that  the  district  court  improperly\n\nrestricted  his defense,  by which  he sought  to establish  that\n\nAgent  Roberto was  less  than fluent  in  Spanish and  may  have\n\nmistranslated  Sanchez' Spanish  statement  into  English  during\n\ndirect examination at trial.6\n\n                    \n\nVegas and Roberto, who  were waiting at a nearby  store, returned\nto Rodrigo's apartment at 2:58.\n\n     5Sanchez  argues  that   Santiago-Martinez  testified   that\nSanchez  did not  make this  comment to  Agent  Roberto.   To the\nextent this  alleged conflict in testimony  necessitated a credi-\nbility determination, we must presume the jury found Roberto more\ncredible.   Furthermore,  Santiago-Martinez'  testimony could  be\nunderstood  as indicating  his  lack of  recollection (\"I  wasn't\npaying attention\"), rather than  as stating that no  such comment\nwas made.\n\n     6Roberto, a DEA  agent since the early 1980s, testified that\nhe had taken a  four-month Spanish course in 1984,  was stationed\nin Monterey, Mexico from 1984 through 1986,  attended an advanced\nSpanish course in 1986, and used his Spanish language  experience\ndaily as a  DEA agent.  Sanchez does not  appear to challenge the\noriginal admission  of Roberto's interpretive testimony, to which\ndefense counsel raised  no objection at  trial.  Accordingly,  we\ndeem the issue waived.  He merely argues that he should have been\nallowed more opportunity to impeach Roberto on  cross-examination\nand on rebuttal.\n\n                                10\n\n          The trial court has broad discretion over the scope and\n\nextent of cross-examination.

Ct. 1223\n                                              \n\n(1992).  Sanchez contends  that the district court cut  short his\n\ncross-examination  of Agent  Roberto  concerning his  proficiency\n\nwith the Spanish language.  We do not agree.  Out of  the hearing\n\nof the jury,  the district court merely questioned  the relevancy\n\nof defense counsel's line of  questioning, which had become mired\n\nin  minute  detail concerning  the  identity  of Agent  Roberto's\n\nneighbors while he was  residing in Monterey during 1986.   At no\n\ntime  did the court prohibit defense  counsel from continuing the\n\nline of questioning, nor does the record reflect any objection to\n\nthe  district court's  statements.   In fact,  when the  jury was\n\nreturned  to the  courtroom,  defense counsel  posed a  follow-up\n\nquestion along the same line.  There was no error.\n\n          Sanchez also  claims that his Sixth  Amendment right to\n\nconfrontation was violated by the court's refusal to allow him to\n\ncall the person who was serving as the court-appointed interpret-\n\ner during  Agent Roberto's  direct examination.7   Sanchez argues\n\n                    \n     7The court explained its ruling as follows:\n\n     I was advised yesterday afternoon that the  Interpreter\n     whom we had here  yesterday afternoon had been told  to\n     appear here today to  testify.  I advised, I  sent work\n     [sic] to him  that he was  not to come  here today.

However,  defense counsel neither objected to\n\nthe  district court's exclusionary  ruling nor  made an  offer of\n\nproof  pursuant  to Fed.  R.  Evid.  103(d), notwithstanding  the\n\ncourt's express statement that  it could not understand  \"why the\n\n[interpreter] would be asked to testify in the first place.\"  See\n                                                                 \n\nsupra note 7.

Agent Roberto's proficiency\n\nin Spanish could as  well have been tested  on cross-examination9\n\nor  through an  interpreter selected  by  the defense,  as indeed\n\ncould  other  possible  translations  of  Sanchez'  incriminating\n\nremark.  Therefore, even if defense counsel believed the district\n\ncourt was adamantly opposed to calling the court-appointed inter-\n\npreter,  there was no apparent reason  for neither explaining the\n\ndefense's  position nor  requesting  a continuance  to obtain  an\n\ninterpreter.

Jorge's Appeal. \n                   \n\n          Jorge Sostre claims that his convictions under Count 1 \n\n(conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent  to distrib-\n\nute, 21  U.S.C.   846)  and Count 2  (possession of cocaine  with\n\nintent to distribute, id.    841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B); 18 U.S.C.   2)\n                         \n\nwere  based solely on his \"mere  presence\" in the vicinity of the\n\ndrug transaction.   Jorge contends  that he  was simply  visiting\n\nbrother Rodrigo's  apartment, and  that the casual  statements he\n\nmade to Vegas  and Agent Roberto, though  arguably indicating his\n\ngeneral  awareness of the drug transaction, were far too vague to\n\nestablish his active participation.   Jorge says the government's\n\ncharacterization  of him  as  a \"lookout\"  is unsupported  by the\n\nevidence, which  shows  that  the front  door  of  the  apartment\n\nbuilding was left open  during the drug transaction, and  that he\n\nnever made any attempt to signal  or warn the others when the DEA\n\nraid began. As  to his  constructive possession  of the  cocaine,\n\nJorge argues that there is  no evidence he ever had access  to it\n\nor power over it.\n\n          We again view all evidence in the light most  favorable\n\nto the government,  Wight, 968 F.2d  at 1395, while  at the  same\n                         \n\ntime recognizing that \"'the line that separates mere presence [at\n\nthe site of a drug offense] from culpable presence is a thin one,\n\ndifficult  to plot,'\" United  States v.

In this case, however, we believe that the\n\nevidence, as  a whole,  adequately supported the  conclusion that\n\n                                17\n\nJorge  knowingly remained  on the front  porch to  facilitate the\n\nprearranged drug transaction.\n\n          First, Jorge's presence during  Rodrigo's incriminating\n\nconversations with  Vegas and Agent Roberto,  his apparent agree-\n\nment with his brother's assessments concerning the quality of the\n\ncocaine and the low level of police activity in the neighborhood,\n\nand  his later  statements about  the \"money\"  and \"merchandise,\"\n\nprovided  firm support for an  inference that Jorge  knew that an\n\nillegal drug transaction was about to occur.\n\n          Second, \"jurors are  neither required to divorce  them-\n\nselves from their  common sense  nor to abandon  the dictates  of\n\nmature experience,\"  which reasonably may  include their recogni-\n\ntion that \"criminals rarely welcome innocent persons as witnesses\n\nto serious crimes.\"  Cf.

Jorge did not\n               \n\nreside at the apartment where the  drug transaction occurred, nor\n\nwas  he  a captive  of  the  circumstances.   Although  appellate\n\ncounsel  suggested  the possibility  that  Jorge's  visit to  his\n\nbrother's  apartment may  have  been occasioned  by the  innocent\n\nimpulse to promote  their filial bond, the  jury reasonably could\n\nconclude that an innocent person, with knowledge of  an impending\n\ndrug transaction, would not linger outside for  over an hour on a\n\nwinter  day in a location  which afforded him  an obvious vantage\n\npoint from  which to observe the surrounding neighborhood as well\n\nas the ingress to the site of  the drug deal.
