In January 2000, two on-duty\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island, police officers, Michael Solitro and\n\nCarlos Saraiva, while responding to a call, shot and killed an off-\n\nduty Providence police officer, Cornel Young (\"Cornel\"), who was\n\nattempting to respond to the same incident under a city policy (the\n\n\"always armed/always on-duty\" policy) that required him to act\n\ndespite being off-duty and out of uniform.                   The two on-duty\n\nofficers, who are white, apparently mistook Cornel, an African-\n\nAmerican, for a threat.\n\n            Cornel's mother, Leisa Young (\"Young\"), filed suit in\n\nfederal court, as administratrix of her son's estate, against\n\nSolitro and Saraiva for use of excessive force during the course of\n\na seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution; she later dismissed these officers as parties to the\n\ncase but sought to hold others liable for the shooting.            Young sued\n\nthe City of Providence and various Providence Police Department\n\n(\"PPD\")   supervisors,     alleging    that   they    were   responsible    for\n\nSolitro's and Saraiva's underlying excessive force violation due to\n\ntheir deficient training, hiring, and discipline of these two\n\nofficers.\n\n            After the first phase of a bifurcated trial, the jury\n\nfound that Officer Solitro, but not Officer Saraiva, had violated\n\nCornel's constitutional rights by using excessive force against\n\nhim.      The   district   court   then     granted   summary    judgment    to\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fProvidence and the supervisors, holding that there was insufficient\n\nevidence        that   these    defendants       a)    caused      the    underlying\n\nconstitutional violation by Solitro and b) possessed the requisite\n\nlevel of fault (deliberate indifference) to allow the case to go to\n\na jury.    Young appealed; certain defendants cross-appealed.\n\n               After a thorough review of the evidence, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court in part and reverse in part.                   The jury verdict in\n\nthe first phase of the case -- finding that Solitro, but not\n\nSaraiva, violated Cornel's constitutional rights -- stands against\n\nchallenges from both sides.             We also affirm the district court's\n\ngrant     of    summary    judgment     against       Young   on    a    claim    that\n\nProvidence's screening of Solitro before hiring him constituted\n\ndeliberate indifference by the City to Cornel's constitutional\n\nrights (the \"hiring claim\"). We explain the exceptional difficulty\n\nin bringing this sort of hiring claim against the City, in light of\n\nBoard of the County Commissioners of Bryan County v. Brown, 520\n\nU.S. 397 (1997), because of the difficulty of showing a causal link\n\nbetween        decisions   to    hire    police       officers     and    subsequent\n\nconstitutional violations by those officers.\n\n               However, we reverse the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment for the City on a claim that it is responsible for\n\ninadequately training Solitro on how to avoid on-duty/off-duty\n\nmisidentifications         in   light    of    the    department's       policy   that\n\nofficers are always armed, and always on-duty.                   In Brown and City\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fof Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378 (1989), the Supreme Court\n\nrecognized that failure to train in a specific area -- such as\n\navoiding on-duty/off-duty misidentifications of fellow officers --\n\nmay   have   a   more      demonstrable         causal   link   to    a    subsequent\n\nconstitutional violation by a police officer than the hiring of\n\nthat officer. It is plaintiff's burden to make that demonstration.\n\nWe    hold   that     there    is     enough     evidence    that    the    City     was\n\ndeliberately indifferent in its training and lack of protocols in\n\nthis area     and     that    the     training    deficiencies      and    absence    of\n\nprotocols were causally linked to Solitro's use of excessive force\n\nagainst Young that a reasonable jury could find in Young's favor on\n\nthis training and lack of protocol claim (the \"training claim\").\n\nA jury could also rationally conclude in defendant's favor, but\n\nthat is not the test on summary judgment.                   The error by the court\n\nlay in taking the case away from the jury.                    Finally, we remand,\n\nwithout discussion, claims against various supervisors to the\n\ndistrict court for consideration in light of our disposition of the\n\ntraining and hiring claims against the City.\n\n             Our decision results in a remand for jury trial on\n\nYoung's claim that the City violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by failing to\n\nadequately train Solitro on issues relating to on-duty/off-duty\n\ninteractions     in    a     manner    that    was   both    causally      related    to\n\nSolitro's     deprivation       of     Cornel's      constitutional        rights    and\n\ndeliberately indifferent to those constitutional rights.\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f                                      I.\n\n           Young filed suit in federal court on June 7, 2001; an\n\namended complaint was filed on December 16, 2002. She asserted (1)\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims against Solitro and Saraiva for excessive\n\nforce under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution;\n\n(2) § 1983 claims against the City of Providence under Monell v.\n\nDepartment of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), for failure to\n\ntrain Solitro, Saraiva, and Cornel, failure to discipline Saraiva\n\nafter an earlier incident, and the hiring of Solitro;1 (3) § 1983\n\nsupervisory liability claims against Urbano Prignano, Jr., Richard\n\nSullivan, John Ryan, Kenneth Cohen, and Saraiva in their personal\n\ncapacities; and (4) pendent state law claims against Solitro,\n\nSaraiva,   Prignano,      Sullivan,    Ryan,   Cohen,   and      the   City   of\n\nProvidence.     We describe later the titles and roles of each of\n\nthese individual defendants.\n\n           On January 24, 2003, defendants Prignano and Sullivan\n\nmoved for summary judgment on the merits of the supervisory claims\n\nagainst them.    This initial motion was granted in part and denied\n\nin part on May 30, 2003.     The district court held that Sullivan was\n\nentitled   to   summary    judgment    on   claims   that   he    inadequately\n\n\n     1\n      Plaintiff also alleged a Monell claim against Urbano\nPrignano, Jr., in his official capacity as allegedly being final\npolicymaker for the City; the district court considered this claim\nas functionally identical to the claims against the City and did\nnot otherwise treat it. See Young v. City of Providence, 301 F.\nSupp. 2d 163, 173 n.12 (D.R.I. 2004).     This claim has not been\nraised by any party on appeal and we do not discuss it.\n\n                                      -6-\n\finvestigated an incident involving Solitro's assault of a minority\n\nofficer when hiring Solitro and that he failed to discipline\n\nSaraiva after a prior shooting.        Other claims against Sullivan\n\nconnected with the hiring of Solitro, however, could go forward,\n\nand hiring, training, and disciplinary claims against Prignano also\n\nsurvived.    Regarding the training claim, the court noted that\n\nplaintiff's evidence suggested that \"the department lacked policies\n\nconcerning the manner in which off-duty officers were to identify\n\nthemselves or to initiate action\" and that \"at best, only minimal\n\noff-duty response training was provided at the police academy.\"2\n\nSome additional evidence was taken between the date of this order\n\nand the subsequent final order where the district court granted\n\nsummary judgment for all municipal and supervisory defendants.\n\n            Solitro and Saraiva moved for summary judgment as to the\n\nclaims against them on March 12, 2003.     The district court granted\n\nthis motion in part and denied it in part on July 1, 2003.       The\n\ncourt held that the excessive force claims against the two officers\n\n\n\n     2\n      The court correctly rejected Prignano's attempt to avoid\nsupervisory liability by stating that he was not a final, official\nmunicipal policymaker under Monell, 436 U.S. at 690 n.55, as the\ncourt noted that this was irrelevant for purposes of supervisory\nliability against Prignano in his personal capacity.\n     The court also refused to entertain Prignano and Sullivan's\nasserted qualified immunity defense.      The court stated that\nPrignano and Sullivan did not make any effort to argue the various\nprongs of qualified immunity analysis (particularly whether the\nright they allegedly violated was clearly established and whether\ntheir conduct was objectively reasonable), and in truth were\nrelying solely on the merits.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fsurvived summary judgment, particularly given that there were\n\nfactual disputes surrounding how Cornel was holding his gun and\n\nwhether he verbally identified himself as an officer in Solitro and\n\nSaraiva's presence.\n\n           On August 13, 2003, Solitro and Saraiva moved for a\n\nseparate trial pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b), seeking to have\n\nthe claims against them severed from the claims against the other\n\ndefendants.       On September 12, 2003, the court granted Young's\n\nmotion to voluntarily dismiss Solitro and Saraiva as defendants\n\nfrom the case, in return for Saraiva and Solitro dropping their\n\nmotion to bifurcate the trial.          However, the other defendants had\n\nmeanwhile joined the motion for a bifurcated trial, and the court\n\ngranted   their    motion   on   the   same   day.   The   court   correctly\n\ninterpreted the case law as stating that even without Solitro and\n\nSaraiva in the case as defendants, any liability against the City\n\nand the supervisory defendants would need to be conditioned on a\n\nfinding that at least one of the officers (Solitro or Saraiva)\n\nviolated Cornel's underlying constitutional right to be free of\n\nexcessive force during the course of a seizure.            Thus, the court\n\nruled that the trial would proceed in two phases: phase one would\n\ndetermine whether Solitro and/or Saraiva had violated Cornel's\n\nconstitutional rights, and, if the answer on phase one were yes for\n\nat least one of the officers, phase two would determine whether\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fthere was any basis for holding Providence and/or the supervisory\n\ndefendants liable for this constitutional violation.\n\n          Phase one of the jury trial commenced on October 8, 2003,\n\nand lasted about three weeks.   Plaintiff presented testimony from\n\nSolitro and Saraiva, several civilian witnesses from the night of\n\nthe shooting (January 28, 2000), and Dr. James Fyfe, an expert on\n\npolice tactics, who offered expert testimony that both Solitro's\n\nleaving cover behind the police cruiser and Saraiva's failure to\n\ninstruct him to maintain cover were contrary to accepted police\n\nstandards in a situation like the one at issue because those\n\nactions substantially raised the risk that police officers would\n\neither be shot or would need to shoot others.   Fyfe's testimony on\n\ncover was admitted over the objections of the defendants. The jury\n\ninstructions included an instruction that \"[i]n considering whether\n\nSolitro and/or Saraiva acted reasonably, you may . . . consider the\n\nevents leading up to the shooting.\"      On October 31, the jury\n\nreturned a special verdict, finding by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that Solitro shot Cornel in violation of the latter's\n\nconstitutional rights, but that Saraiva did not do so.\n\n          As we explain in our companion opinion in Scheck v. City\n\nof Providence, No. 04-1334, issued this same day, the pro hac vice\n\nstatus of two members of plaintiff's three-person legal team,\n\nincluding lead counsel Barry Scheck, was revoked mid-trial (at the\n\nend of the day on October 17), and the third member was forced to\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fconduct much of the trial alone.         See Young v. City of Providence,\n\n301 F. Supp. 2d 187, 194-95 (D.R.I. 2004).           At the conclusion of\n\nthe trial, all three members of the team were found to have\n\nviolated Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, and Scheck was publicly censured.             See\n\nid. at 198-99.\n\n            At the conclusion of Young's presentation of her case and\n\nagain after the close of all evidence, the defendants moved for\n\njudgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50.           See Young v.\n\nCity of Providence, 301 F. Supp. 2d 163, 168 (D.R.I. 2004).                The\n\ncourt heard argument on these motions on November 3, 2003, along\n\nwith argument on a motion for summary judgment that had been filed\n\nby Providence, Ryan, and Cohen in June 2003 but never decided by\n\nthe court and held in abeyance pending completion of phase one.\n\nSee id. at 169.       On November 5 (embodied in a written order dated\n\nFebruary 11, 2004), the court denied defendants' Rule 50 motions,\n\ngranted summary judgment for Providence, Ryan, and Cohen on the\n\nmunicipal    and   supervisory    liability    claims,    and   sua    sponte\n\nreconsidered its May 30, 2003 order denying summary judgment and\n\ngranted     summary    judgment   to    Prignano   and   Sullivan     on   the\n\nsupervisory claims against those officers.           See Young v. City of\n\nProvidence, 301 F. Supp. 2d 163, 170 (D.R.I. 2004).3\n\n\n     3\n      We note that the court's February 11, 2004 written order also\ngranted judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment in favor of\ndefendants on all of Young's various pendant state law claims. See\nid. at 184-87. Young has not appealed the judgment on these state\nlaw claims to us, and any challenge to the dismissal of these state\n\n                                       -10-\n\f          The court held that municipal and supervisory claims\n\nbased on the failure to discipline and train Saraiva must fail,\n\ngiven that Saraiva himself was not found to have violated Cornel's\n\nconstitutional rights.   See id. at 173.   Moreover, the court held\n\nthat any evidence that the City had failed to train Cornel to deal\n\nwith off-duty situations was irrelevant, given that Cornel had no\n\nconstitutional right to training.      See id. at 182.   The claim\n\nagainst Providence based on failure to train Solitro failed to\n\nsurvive summary judgment for three reasons: 1) there was inadequate\n\nspecific evidence that the training program was deficient, 2) there\n\nwas insufficient evidence of deliberate indifference, and 3) there\n\nwas insufficient evidence of causation.    See id. at 177-78.   The\n\ncourt relied on the training outlined in deposition by Steven\n\nMelaragno and Robert Boehm, two officers who ran the firing range\n\nfor PPD recruits, as evidence that the City did provide training on\n\nissues relating to off-duty/on-duty interactions.   See id. at 176-\n\n77.   The court held that the report submitted by Dr. James Fyfe,\n\nplaintiff's expert witness on police training, was unsworn, and\n\nthus should not be considered; at any rate, even if it were\n\nconsidered, it was merely \"conclusory\" and \"not of sufficient\n\nevidentiary quality.\"    Id. at 177.\n\n          The court held that the claim against Providence for\n\ndeficient hiring procedures in the hiring of Solitro also failed to\n\n\nlaw claims has been waived.\n\n                                -11-\n\fsurvive the high standards set out for such claims in Board of\n\nCounty Commissioners of Bryan County v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397 (1997).\n\nSolitro's use of force, the court held, was not a plainly obvious\n\nconsequence of his hiring as an officer.             See Young, 301 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 179-81. Finally, the supervisory claims against Ryan, Cohen,\n\nPrignano,      and   Sullivan   failed     because    Young's     theories   of\n\nsupervisory liability were factually and legally indistinguishable\n\nfrom her theories of municipal liability against Providence.                 See\n\nid. at 183-84.       Although Prignano and Sullivan did not file for\n\nreconsideration of the earlier denial of summary judgment on their\n\nclaims, the court sua sponte granted them summary judgment based on\n\nthe factual and legally indistinguishability of the claims made\n\nagainst them from the claims made against Providence.4\n\n              Final judgment in favor of defendants entered on February\n\n12, 2004, and Young filed her appeal on March 10.               She appeals the\n\ngrant    of   summary   judgment   against    her    on   the    municipal   and\n\nsupervisory claims that she has raised.         She argues that there was\n\n\n     4\n      Young takes issue with the procedural fairness of the sua\nsponte grant of summary judgment in favor of Sullivan and Prignano.\nThere are two responses.     First, if this lack of notice had\nprecluded Young from addressing all the evidence as to the\nliability of Sullivan and Prignano, we would be more sympathetic.\nBut that was not the situation here.       Young was on notice of\nProvidence's motion, and had every incentive to present her best\ncase in opposition to summary judgment.      Sua sponte grants of\nsummary judgment are allowable so long as the losing party was on\nnotice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence.\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 326 (1986).     Second, the\nrecord is fixed and our review of that record is de novo, so there\nis no harm in any event.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fsufficient evidence for the training claims and hiring claims\n\nagainst Providence and the relevant supervisory defendants to go\n\nforward to trial.   She also argues that because her lead counsel\n\nwas removed mid-trial, the adverse jury finding that Saraiva did\n\nnot violate Cornel's constitutional rights in phase one ought be\n\nvacated.    Providence, Ryan, Cohen, Prignano, and Sullivan all\n\ncross-appealed, challenging the admission of certain evidence in\n\nthe phase one trial against Solitro, and asking that the jury\n\nfinding that Solitro violated Cornel's constitutional rights be\n\noverturned.   The individual supervisory defendants (Ryan, Cohen,\n\nPrignano, and Sullivan) also ask for qualified immunity, even\n\nshould the claims against the City go forward.\n\n                              II.\n\nA. Facts as to Phase One: The Verdict on the Underlying Excessive\n   Force Claim\n\n           We consider the evidence introduced at phase one of the\n\ntrial in favor of the jury's verdict that Solitro violated Cornel's\n\nFourth Amendment rights by using excessive force against him during\n\nthe course of a seizure, and draw all inferences and resolve all\n\ncredibility disputes in that direction.    See Lubetzky v. United\n\nStates, 393 F.3d 76, 79 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           On the early morning of January 28, 2000, at 1:43 a.m.,\n\non-duty PPD officers Solitro and Saraiva, who were on patrol in a\n\npolice cruiser together, responded to a dispatch call reporting a\n\ndisturbance at Fidas Restaurant in Providence.    The dispatch was\n\n                               -13-\n\ffor \"females fighting at Fidas\" and was designated a Code 2 call;\n\nCode 2 meant an \"urgent\" call and represented the middle range of\n\nurgency in the PPD's dispatch system, between a Code 1 call, which\n\nrepresented an \"emergency\" call and Code 3, which represented a\n\n\"routine\" call.       Solitro was an eight-day rookie on the force;\n\nSaraiva was a three-year veteran and was informally acting as\n\nSolitro's training officer.\n\n            As the officers drove up to the restaurant in their\n\npatrol car, they saw a man (later identified as Aldrin Diaz)\n\nrunning towards the door of a Chevrolet Camaro, which he then\n\nentered.    After the police had pulled up about 8 to 12 feet from\n\nthe Camaro and while they were still in the police cruiser, Solitro\n\nand Saraiva saw Diaz pointing a gun out the window of the Camaro;\n\nSolitro then said \"gun\" to Saraiva.        That was the only word the two\n\nofficers exchanged during the entire incident. Saraiva and Solitro\n\ngot out of their car; Saraiva took cover behind some poles while\n\nSolitro took cover behind the engine block and front wheel of the\n\npolice     cruiser.      Both   officers     yelled   commands   at   Diaz\n\nsimultaneously: they told him to drop the gun and to get out of the\n\ncar.   The officers could see that Diaz no longer had the gun in his\n\nhands and was starting to get out of the car by the time that the\n\nofficers saw Cornel.\n\n            Saraiva never moved from his position until the end of\n\nthe incident.    Solitro, after a few seconds in a position of cover\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fbehind the cruiser, left this position of cover and walked into an\n\nopen spot directly in front of the Camaro.   He stated that he did\n\nthis because his cover behind the patrol car was imperfect, because\n\nhe wanted to get a better look at the Camaro, because he wanted to\n\nmake a rapid arrest of Diaz, and because he wanted to keep Diaz\n\nguessing. Plaintiff's expert witness, Dr. James Fyfe, an expert on\n\npolice tactics, testified that Solitro's leaving of cover was\n\n\"inconsistent with accepted police practices\" because it made\n\nSolitro far more vulnerable and therefore made it more likely that\n\ndeadly force would have to be used by Solitro and Saraiva in order\n\nto defend Solitro.\n\n           Meanwhile, Cornel, an off-duty PPD officer, had been\n\ninside the restaurant as a customer.    Civilian witnesses located\n\ninside the restaurant testified that they saw Cornel run through\n\nthe restaurant at around the time the police arrived, yelling\n\n\"police, police\" or \"police, get out of the way\" very loudly.   They\n\nsaw him run through the doors of the restaurant as he continued to\n\nyell \"police,\" and then heard him yell, \"freeze.\"   Cornel left the\n\nrestaurant within a few seconds of the arrival of Solitro and\n\nSaraiva.   A jury could easily find that Cornel was acting pursuant\n\nto the always armed/always on-duty policy of the PPD.\n\n           Diaz, the man who had dropped the gun at police command,\n\nwas located outside the restaurant at the time.   He testified that\n\nhe saw Cornel walk out of the restaurant holding his gun and scream\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f\"freeze.\"       Diaz stated that he could tell that Cornel was a police\n\nofficer, from his verbal command, his body language, and his\n\ndemeanor.       There was then some movement by someone at the scene.\n\nDiaz stated that Cornel made a quarter turn and faced Diaz, but\n\nCornel's gun was pointing at an angle downwards in front of Cornel\n\nand not towards Diaz or anyone else.           Diaz also stated that Cornel\n\nwas screaming other verbal commands during and after the quarter\n\nturn, but Diaz was not paying attention and did not understand\n\nthem.\n\n               Joseph Hayman, another civilian witness located outside\n\nthe restaurant        who    was   involved   in   the   altercation   that     had\n\nprompted the initial dispatch call, testified as well that he heard\n\nCornel yell \"freeze\"; Hayman then turned to look at Cornel. Hayman\n\ntestified that upon hearing this command, he figured the speaker\n\nwas a cop, given the tone of the voice, and he responded to the\n\ncommand by putting his hands up.           He further testified that Cornel\n\nwas holding his gun with two hands, as a police officer would,\n\nrather than sideways with one hand (a technique called \"gangster-\n\nstyle\" by some of the witnesses).              Hayman, like Diaz, testified\n\nthat       Cornel   turned   but   never   began   to    approach   Diaz   or   the\n\nofficers.5\n\n\n       5\n      There were disputes of fact on virtually all of the critical\npoints testified to by Diaz, Hayman, and the witnesses inside\nFidas. For example, Solitro and Saraiva testified that they never\nheard Cornel say anything, and Saraiva further testified that\nCornel was deliberately walking towards Diaz and Solitro and that\n\n                                       -16-\n\f            A witness inside Fidas testified that he heard the shots\n\nthat killed Cornel being fired only \"[a] second\" after Cornel had\n\nleft the restaurant; he referred to the timing of the shots after\n\nCornel had left the restaurant as \"instant.\"     Diaz testified that\n\nCornel was shot a \"couple of seconds\" after he made the quarter\n\nturn.   Hayman agreed that Cornel was shot immediately after he\n\nbegan to turn.\n\n            Saraiva and Solitro both testified that they both yelled,\n\nsimultaneously, \"drop the gun\" or \"drop it\" more than once.    It is\n\nundisputed that they never prefaced their commands with the word\n\n\"police.\"   Then, both officers shot Cornel multiple times, killing\n\nhim: Saraiva and Solitro testified that Saraiva shot first, and\n\nSolitro shot immediately thereafter.     Diaz testified:\n\n            [The two officers were] shooting and screaming\n            at the same time . . . . And . . . Solitro,\n            he's like hysterical moving. . . . [H]e was\n            like running in place like.      His feet was\n            moving, and he's shooting and he's like\n            shooting with both hands, one hand. And he's\n            just freaking out, screaming out at the top of\n            his head.\n\n            The jury found Solitro, but not Saraiva, to have violated\n\nCornel's constitutional rights.\n\n\n\n\nhis gun was aimed at Diaz, not down towards the ground. Further,\nSaraiva testified that Cornel was holding the gun with one hand,\nsideways. These disputes of fact, of course, were for the jury to\nresolve.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fB. Facts as to Phase Two: Liability of the City and Supervisory\n   Defendants\n\n              Because phase two was decided as a pre-trial summary\n\njudgment motion filed by the defendants, we recount the facts in\n\nthe   light    most   favorable   to   Young,   drawing   all   reasonable\n\ninferences in her favor.     See Noviello v. City of Boston, 398 F.3d\n\n76, 81-82 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nStructure of Authority\n\n              The Providence Commissioner of Public Safety (who also\n\nheaded the fire department) was the head of the PPD.                  John\n\nPartington, a civilian, held that position for the relevant periods\n\nin this case. The Commissioner is statutorily \"responsible for the\n\nadministration and discipline of the police department\" and has\n\n              authority to make all rules and regulations\n              necessary for the efficiency, management and\n              direction of the police department.     Said\n              rules shall provide for the qualification,\n              appointment, removal, organization, powers,\n              duties, discipline and control of members of\n              the police department . . . .\n\nProvidence City Charter § 1001(a). The PPD chief of police, Urbano\n\nPrignano, Jr., during the relevant periods for this case, was\n\nappointed by the Commissioner and served at his direction.           Id.\n\nLack of Specific Protocols and Training\n\n              Young argues that Solitro and Saraiva's excessive force\n\nagainst Cornel was caused by a lack of training provided by the\n\nCity and certain supervisors who have been named as defendants --\n\nPrignano, the PPD Chief of Police at all times when Solitro,\n\n                                   -18-\n\fSaraiva, and Cornel were on the force; John Ryan, the head of the\n\ntraining academy     when   Saraiva   and   Cornel   attended   it   as   new\n\nrecruits, and Kenneth Cohen, the head of the training academy when\n\nSolitro attended it as a new recruit. Specifically, plaintiff\n\nargues that given the City's always armed/always on-duty policy,\n\nwhich was known to be a dangerous policy, the PPD was required to\n\nhave protocols and give training on various aspects of the policy,\n\nparticularly the issue of avoiding misidentification of off-duty\n\nofficers.6\n\n             The always armed/always on-duty policy as it existed at\n\nthe time of Cornel's shooting stated as follows:\n\n             Except when on annual leave, a member shall be\n             armed at all times while off duty . . . .\n             A member shall act in his official capacity if\n             he becomes aware of an incident which requires\n             immediate police action and time is of the\n             essence to safeguard life or property. While\n             off duty, a member who takes police action . .\n             . shall be considered to be in an on-duty\n             status . . . .\n             Should an off-duty member become aware of an\n             incident which requires police action, and\n             life or property is not endangered, he shall\n             report the incident to the appropriate . . .\n             agency for action.\n\nPPD Regs. §§ 202.1, 202.2. The relevant regulations further stated\n\nas follows:\n\n             Duty status -- Although certain workday hours\n             are allotted to every member of the force for\n             the performance of specific workday duties, a\n\n\n     6\n      Young has made no argument that the City failed to train on\nissues of cover.\n\n                                  -19-\n\f            member of the force shall be in an \"on duty\"\n            status at all times for the preservation of\n            the peace and the protection of life, liberty\n            or property.   A member shall be prepared at\n            all times and under all circumstances to\n            perform immediately a police duty whether or\n            not the member is in uniform or off workday\n            duty whenever the member is cognizant of a\n            need for police.\n\nPPD Regs. § 201.3.\n\n            Defendants, as evidence that the PPD did provide training\n\non off-duty/on-duty interaction issues relevant to the always\n\narmed/always on-duty policy, relied heavily on the deposition\n\ntestimony of Steven Melaragno and Robert Boehm to the effect that\n\nsome form    of   training   was   provided,   even   if   not   necessarily\n\ndirectly on the hazards of the policy.         Melaragno was in charge of\n\nfirearms training at the training academy's firing range for new\n\nrecruits and for current officers (who go through periodic \"in\n\nservice\" training); Boehm worked under Melaragno at the range.\n\nMelaragno stated that both in-service and new recruit training\n\nwould include paintball \"simunition\" scenarios, and the goal of the\n\ntraining was to gauge the training officer's response whether to\n\nshoot or hold fire.    Training would include multiple scenarios, at\n\nleast one of which would be a no-shoot situation: this no-shoot\n\nsituation might, but need not, involve an off-duty officer as the\n\npotential target (it could also include an innocent bystander, like\n\na store owner).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f            Melaragno also stated that training included a Range 2000\n\nvideo    simulator,    which   would   confront   officers   with   virtual\n\nscenarios.     Officers injected into a troublesome situation (say a\n\nvehicle stop or an injured officer) would determine which commands\n\nto give and which tactics to use; if they made certain choices,\n\nshooting might be required.      Melaragno was uncertain if any of the\n\nfive or six Range 2000 scenarios specifically dealt with situations\n\ninvolving off-duty officers, although they certainly did deal with\n\nother types of no-shoot situations.7       Partington, the Commissioner\n\nof the PPD during the relevant period, testified that in his view,\n\nRange 2000 did not specifically deal with the problem of \"friendly\n\nfire\" due to off-duty misidentifications.\n\n             Melaragno testified more generally that new recruits are\n\ntaught that when taking action off-duty, they always need to\n\nidentify themselves by displaying their badge and firearm, and\n\ncalling out that they are \"on the job.\"       He testified that some of\n\nthis training occurred at the firing range, but some occurred in\n\nclassroom training that was provided in conjunction with firing\n\nrange training.       Melaragno testified initially in his deposition\n\nthat this off-duty classroom training was integrated into a series\n\n\n\n     7\n      Melaragno stated that there were some static targets a few\nminutes before the video scenarios began, which were used as warmup\nfor the officers.    These included plainclothes officers wearing\nbadges along with hostile targets and bull's eyes, but Melaragno\nsaid that he \"really d[id not] consider them\" since they were\nstatic.\n\n                                   -21-\n\fof seven lectures on officer survival (the lectures were on issues\n\nlike cover).    However, he testified later in the same deposition\n\nthat there was a separate, eighth lecture on off-duty issues.\n\nBoehm told a grand jury investigating the Cornel shooting that\n\nofficers were never \"directly\" taught that they needed to display\n\ntheir badge with their gun when taking action off-duty; this is\n\nsomething they would pick up \"inferentially\" from other training,\n\nsuch as the paper cutout training described below.\n\n           Boehm stated at his deposition that there were several\n\nhours of training at the academy for new recruits at a live firing\n\nrange involving paper cutouts -- the officers once again had to\n\ndecide whether to shoot or not.          Some of these cutouts were dressed\n\nup like plainclothes officers with badges.            Further, all recruits\n\nwent to Camp Varnum, a training facility that was set up like a\n\nsmall city: recruits, who played on-duty officers, responded to\n\nfake dispatch calls where scenarios played out.             Five or six of\n\nthese scenarios involved off-duty officers (never played by the\n\nrecruits) who were jumping out of cars quickly, moving quickly to\n\nget their badges, or running into situations where police were\n\ninvestigating suspicious persons.           The recruits' reactions to the\n\nunexpected emergence of off-duty officers were critiqued with an\n\ninstructor after each scenario had been completed.\n\n           Still, the testimony of Melaragno and Boehm was disputed.\n\nThere   were   two   themes   to   the    factual   disputes.   First,   the\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\ftestimony of Melaragno and Boehm as to off-duty training was not\n\ndocumented in any form, as might be expected had it occurred.\n\nSecond, other witnesses testified that no pertinent training took\n\nplace.\n\n          Both Melaragno and defendant Ryan, head of the PPD police\n\ntraining academy for several years, agreed that it was essential to\n\ndocument training,    and    both   stated   that    there    was,   in   fact,\n\nsubstantial documentation of other aspects of training.              Melaragno\n\nstated that the training scenarios described were not documented\n\nbecause of an \"oversight\"; he admitted that this violated the basic\n\npro-documentation policy of the academy.            He also testified that\n\ndocumentation   of    classroom       training       on      on-duty/off-duty\n\ninteractions, along with other material from that piece of the\n\ncurriculum (officer survival week), had simply been lost.\n\n          Further, Ryan testified at deposition inconsistently with\n\nthe testimony of Melaragno and Boehm, as did other witnesses. Ryan\n\ntestified that the only kind of academy training on on-duty/off-\n\nduty interactions that he knew about was his own class on civil\n\nliability training: he taught officers that because of possible\n\nexposure to liability, it was better if they did not take police\n\naction off-duty (in express contravention of the department's\n\nwritten policy).     He emphasized that this training focused on\n\nliability concerns and did not discuss safety.            He stated that he\n\nwould know   about   any    other   training   on   off-duty     issues    that\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\foccurred at the academy, except for training on internal affairs by\n\na Sergeant Bennett (on avoiding misconduct by drinking too much\n\noff-duty, etc.) and training on firearms by Melaragno.                He stated\n\nfurther that he would know about any \"substantial training\" by\n\nMelaragno on on-duty/off-duty interactions and misidentifications,\n\nand he did not know of any.\n\n          Defendant Cohen, who was head of the academy when Solitro\n\nattended, testified that he did not know one way or the other\n\nwhether training on on-duty/off-duty interactions existed.\n\n          One PPD police officer, Shane Romano, recalled that there\n\nwas no training on officers identifying themselves while off-duty.\n\nAnother   officer,    Greg    Small,   mentioned      Range    2000    training\n\nregarding off-duty altercations.           Solitro, when asked whether he\n\nhad any training on on-duty/off-duty identification issues, also\n\ncited some Range 2000 training that he had while at the academy.\n\nHe recalled no other specific training on off-duty issues, although\n\nhe agreed that \"[t]here may have been some off-duty issues raised\n\nhere and there in terms of questions and answers but no [specific]\n\ncourse on it.\"       Saraiva recalled some training involving paper\n\ncutouts that represented off-duty officers at the range; he noted\n\nthat this involved no interaction with off-duty officers.\n\n           Prignano,    the   PPD   police    chief   during    the    relevant\n\nperiod, stated that in his view, off-duty officers are taught at\n\nthe academy to identify themselves by showing their badge, but at\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fany rate, this identification protocol is \"common sense,\" and\n\n\"[you] can't teach common sense.\"8             Chief Prignano's testimony\n\ncould be understood to mean that there was no pertinent training\n\nbecause no training was needed, as identification issues were\n\nsimply a matter of common sense.\n\nNecessity of Specific Protocols and Training\n\n                Commissioner Partington agreed with the assessment of\n\nplaintiff's expert, Dr. James Fyfe, that \"off-duty encounters, and\n\nthe risk they might be interrupted by on-duty police, are a well-\n\nrecognized hazard of urban policing for which officers must be\n\ncarefully schooled by policy and training.\"             He agreed with Fyfe\n\nthat       an   always   armed/always     on-duty   policy   was   inherently\n\ndangerous, and that given the department's always armed/always on-\n\nduty policy, specific training and a protocol were necessary to\n\navoid friendly fire shootings of off-duty officers.                He further\n\nagreed with Fyfe that \"[w]here such training and policy do not\n\nexist, it can be expected that off-duty officers will intervene\n\nunwisely, that on-duty officers will mistake them for suspects, and\n\nthat unnecessary blood will be shed by the public and by officers.\"\n\n                More specifically, Commissioner Partington testified that\n\ninteractions between on-duty and off-duty officers were very high\n\nstress situations, and training was needed for the very high stress\n\n\n       8\n      Despite Prignano's belief, there was evidence that certain\nofficers did not understand that department policy required them to\ncarry their badges with them while off-duty.\n\n                                        -25-\n\fsituations that officers face, since officers tend to fall back on\n\ntheir training in these situations.         Partington agreed with Fyfe\n\nthat training on off-duty/on-duty misidentification must, inter\n\nalia,   \"[p]rovide    instruction     on   the    risks    associated     with\n\nencountering other law enforcement personnel while taking off-duty\n\naction\" and \"[s]ensitize officers to the possibility that, while\n\ntaking on-duty action, they may encounter off-duty personnel.\" Yet\n\nPartington testified that the only PPD training on off-duty/on-duty\n\ninteractions he was aware of was that an officer should not get\n\ninvolved while off-duty unless a situation is life threatening\n\n(which is contrary to the language of the policy and the testimony\n\nof many other witnesses).     He testified that the PPD also offered\n\nRange 2000 training, but admitted that, in his view, this did not\n\n\"deal[] with the problem of friendly fire incidents.\"\n\n            Melaragno also emphasized the need for particularized\n\ntraining    on   on-duty/off-duty    interactions.         Melaragno     stated\n\nsimilarly   that   on-duty/off-duty    interactions       were   high    stress\n\nsituations, and even though the correct actions might seem like\n\ncommon sense, training was required because \"under periods of high\n\nstress sometimes you need to make sure someone understands what\n\nthey need to do.\"    Melaragno further stressed the very substantial\n\npotential    for   tragic   consequences    (as    in     this   case)    if   a\n\nmisidentification occurs.     Boehm testified that given the severity\n\nof a friendly fire incident, he knew that the department had to\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\ftrain to avoid such an incident despite the lack of prior friendly\n\nfire shootings in the City.\n\n             Plaintiff presented numerous reports from police officers\n\nof past misidentifications of off-duty personnel in Providence,\n\nparticularly    involving   minority   officers,   and   thus,   presented\n\nevidence that the department was on notice of a misidentification\n\nproblem.     Indeed, both Cornel and his police officer father had\n\nbeen the subject of misidentifications in the past.        None of these\n\nearlier incidents had a violent or tragic outcome.\n\n             Plaintiff's expert, Dr. James Fyfe, wrote a report for\n\nthis case based on his understanding of standard police practice\n\nand his research into other friendly fire shootings.         Fyfe is the\n\nDeputy Commissioner for Training of the New York City Police\n\nDepartment and an authority on police tactics and training, with a\n\ndoctorate in criminal justice from the State University of New York\n\nat Albany.    He has reviewed more than 10,000 police shootings over\n\nthe course of his career.     Fyfe wrote that always armed/always on-\n\nduty policies such as the PPD policy at issue here were well-known\n\nto carry a high risk of \"fatal consequences for off-duty officers,\"\n\nlargely because \"minimally competent police administrators have\n\nlong recognized that there is a great distinction between officers'\n\ncapacity to act forcibly while on-duty and their ability to do so\n\noff-duty.\"     Thus, always armed/always on-duty policies \"must be\n\naccompanied by training such as that described in [his research],\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fand that specifies a protocol designed to avoid apparent friendly\n\nfire tragedies such as occurred in this case.\"         Absent such\n\ntraining, it can be expected that on-duty officers will mistake\n\noff-duty officers attempting to intervene in a situation for\n\nsuspects, which will lead to unnecessary bloodshed.\n\n          There was testimony that the need to train on the always\n\narmed/always on-duty policy was heightened by the fact that there\n\nwas some evidence that officers were sometimes unclear what exactly\n\nthe policy required.   Commissioner Partington was, before seeing\n\nthe written text of the policy, under the erroneous impression that\n\nit only required action when there was a life threatening situation\n\nand that off-duty police action was only used as a last resort.\n\nAnd Ryan, as stated above, taught off-duty officers never to take\n\npolice action, for liability reasons.\n\n          The PPD changed the always armed/always on-duty policy in\n\n2001, after the Cornel shooting, so that officers were no longer\n\nrequired to carry firearms while off-duty.    The new policy also\n\nclarified that off-duty officers would sufficiently fulfill their\n\nobligations under the policy by reporting an incident to police,\n\nand provided a specific protocol for any off-duty action that was\n\ntaken.\n\nHiring\n\n          Young also argues that Providence is liable for hiring\n\nSolitro without conducting an adequate background investigation.\n\n\n                               -28-\n\fAs well, Young asserts supervisory claims connected with this\n\nmunicipal claim, against both Prignano and Major Richard Sullivan\n\n(who was head of the oral hiring board, an institution described\n\nbelow, when Solitro was hired).\n\n          There is evidence that Solitro, who was a former employee\n\nat a juvenile detention facility, used excessive force against\n\nresidents at the juvenile facility several times while attempting\n\nto restrain them, and was disciplined for this at least once.\n\nThere was further evidence that he was repeatedly absent from his\n\nwork, that he broke a pool table, that he ripped a phone off the\n\nwall because he was angry with a juvenile, and that the facility\n\nmade Solitro see a counselor weekly for six months for anger\n\ncontrol treatment.    Solitro had also assaulted Detective Greg\n\nSmall, an off-duty African-American police officer, and referred to\n\nhim by using a racial slur, in the parking lot of a club in 1989;\n\nSolitro pled no contest to a simple assault charge and his record\n\nwas later expunged.\n\n          A background check on Solitro was conducted by a PPD\n\ndetective Oscar Perez in accordance with a standard form packet\n\nissued by the PPD; there is a written copy of these forms, filled\n\nout, in Solitro's case.     The background check consisted of an\n\ninterview of Solitro, his wife, his neighbors, and two supervisors\n\nat the juvenile facility.     The first supervisor stated, as a\n\nresponse to form questions, that she found Solitro's work at the\n\n\n                               -29-\n\ftraining school satisfactory, that she would rehire him, that he\n\nwas the type of person that she would like to see as a police\n\nofficer in her town, and that if her son or daughter were in\n\ntrouble with the authorities, Solitro was someone that she would\n\nlike to have handle the case.   Further, she noted that Solitro \"has\n\ngained a lot of experience on this job\" and \"would make . . . a\n\ngood   police   officer.\"    Perez   spoke   to   this   supervisor   for\n\napproximately 10 or 15 minutes.      She also told Perez that one of\n\nSolitro's duties was to restrain juveniles; Perez may or may not\n\nhave specifically asked whether he acted improperly in this role.\n\nThe supervisor told about a near \"riot\" incident in the juvenile\n\nfacility that Solitro had appropriately brought under control. She\n\ndid not specifically discuss Solitro's disciplinary history with\n\nPerez: she stated later (after the shooting of Cornel) that she\n\nthought this information was confidential, that there was another\n\nway for the PPD to request it, and that therefore she could not\n\ndiscuss it during the interview.        The PPD never requested or\n\nreceived a copy of Solitro's personnel file from this juvenile\n\nfacility.\n\n            The second supervisor interviewed stated that Solitro was\n\nan \"honest guy\" who \"would do a good job\" as a police officer.\n\nThere is evidence that one of Solitro's other supervisors, Brian\n\nTerry, who was not interviewed, was concerned about Solitro's\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\ffitness and called an officer on the force who was his uncle to\n\ndiscuss the matter.\n\n            The background check was only a piece of Solitro's\n\nevaluation during the hiring process. 2,200 applicants applied for\n\nplaces in the 57th and 58th PPD recruit classes: only 48 recruits\n\nwere selected for the 57th police academy (including Saraiva and\n\nCornel), while only 22 officers (including Solitro) were selected\n\nfor the 58th class. Solitro had to pass a written test and an\n\nagility test, and once he did so he was interviewed by a three-\n\nperson oral review board, which ranked the candidates.         This\n\nranking determined the order in which candidates were admitted to\n\nthe academy.   Psychological testing was also performed.   There is\n\nevidence that Small spoke with defendant Sullivan, the officer in\n\ncharge of the oral hiring board for Solitro's academy, before\n\nSolitro was hired, and told Sullivan about the assault.    Sullivan\n\nraised the issues with Solitro before the oral board.9\n\n            Young argues that the decision to hire Solitro was part\n\nof a pattern of inadequate screening by the PPD when hiring new\n\nofficers.    Several detectives who performed background checks at\n\none time or another as part of their duties, including Perez,\n\nstated that they had no training on how to conduct them.   A brief,\n\n\n     9\n      Before the board, Solitro stated that he had a fight with\nSmall but did not know that he was a police officer at the time.\nSullivan believed the story partly because Solitro was charged with\nsimple assault, rather than the more significant crime of knowingly\nassaulting a police officer.\n\n                                -31-\n\fthree-page set of guidelines on conducting background checks was\n\nprovided with the background check packets used in screening\n\nSolitro's class. There was also evidence that neither Prignano nor\n\nSullivan received or read background checks -- Prignano stated that\n\nSullivan, as head of the hiring board, should have brought any\n\nconcerns to him after reviewing the background check in conjunction\n\nwith other materials, while Sullivan said that he never saw the\n\nbackground investigations and did not know who considered them.\n\nEvidence existed as well that some candidates whom background\n\ninvestigators recommended be rejected were subsequently accepted to\n\nlater academy classes without any consultation with the original\n\nbackground investigator who wrote the negative report.10\n\n           Finally,     there    was   some      evidence    of      generalized\n\ncorruption in the PPD's hiring and promotions practices.               Officers\n\nseeking promotions were allowed to cheat on certain promotional\n\nexams.    Further, there is evidence that one applicant for a PPD\n\nposition benefitted from a bribe: despite officials knowing that he\n\nhad a series of arrests and an expunged criminal record for\n\nimpersonating   a     police    officer    and    being     caught    near   his\n\ngirlfriend's cabin with a rifle, the applicant was not removed from\n\n\n     10\n      Many of these policies were changed after the Cornel\nincident.    Partington and a new Chief of Police (Sullivan)\ninstituted more thorough background investigations (particularly\nregarding searches for expunged criminal records), began training\nbackground investigators on how to conduct their investigations,\nand ensured that oral hiring boards had access to the results of\nbackground investigations.\n\n                                    -32-\n\fthe   academy   list.    Partington     eventually   ensured   that   the\n\nindividual's name was removed from the list and he was never\n\nhired.11\n\n                                III.\n\nChallenges to the Phase one Verdicts\n\n            Both Young and the defendants raise challenges to the\n\nphase one jury verdicts.     Defendants challenge the verdict that\n\nSolitro violated Cornel's constitutional rights; Young challenges\n\nthe verdict that Saraiva did not.       We address these challenges in\n\nturn, ultimately determining that there is no need to disturb the\n\njury's verdicts.\n\n1. The Defendants' Challenge to the Solitro Verdict of\n   Constitutional Violation\n\n            Ryan and Cohen argue strenuously that the Solitro verdict\n\nmust be overturned because of the erroneous admission of testimony\n\nthat Solitro left cover, and in particular the testimony of Dr.\n\nFyfe, which focused on assessing the propriety of Solitro's leaving\n\ncover.     This argument is incorrect; the court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in admitting this evidence. Likewise, the court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in instructing the jury that \"events leading\n\n\n      11\n      Young also asserts a third set of facts as a possible basis\nfor municipal and supervisory liability (against Prignano and\nSullivan). Plaintiff argues that the PPD's failure to discipline\nSaraiva after a prior incident in which he pepper sprayed a crowd\nand shot a civilian reflected deliberate indifference that caused\nCornel's death.    But because we uphold the jury's finding that\nSaraiva did not violate Cornel's constitutional rights, we need not\nrecount any of the facts about this claim.\n\n                                 -33-\n\fup to the shooting\" could be considered by it in determining the\n\nexcessive force question.\n\n             The rule in this circuit is that once it is clear that a\n\nseizure has occurred, \"the court should examine the actions of the\n\ngovernment officials leading up to the seizure.\"                 St. Hilaire v.\n\nCity of Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 26 (1st Cir. 1995).                  Thus, police\n\nofficers' actions for our purposes need not be examined solely at\n\nthe \"moment of the shooting.\"            Id.; see also Roy v. City of\n\nLewiston, 42 F.3d 691, 696 (1st Cir. 1994) (considering within the\n\ncontext of an excessive force case that the plaintiff \"was armed;\n\nhe   apparently   tried   to   kick   and    strike   at   the    officers;   he\n\ndisobeyed repeated instructions to put down the weapons\" as well as\n\nwhether the police, tactically, should have been armed with non-\n\nlethal mace as well as guns and whether they should have \"kept\n\ntheir distance\" from the plaintiff instead of trying to subdue him\n\nat all).12    This rule is most consistent with the Supreme Court's\n\nmandate that we consider these cases in the \"totality of the\n\ncircumstances.\"13    Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 8-9 (1985); see\n\n\n      12\n      The various circuits have taken somewhat different positions\non the question of how conduct leading up to a challenged shooting\nshould be weighed in an excessive force case.           See, e.g.,\nBillington v. Smith, 292 F.3d 1177, 1187-88 (9th Cir. 2002)\n(collecting cases and explaining the different approaches). The\nFourth Circuit, for example, has gone so far as to say that pre-\nshooting conduct is generally \"not relevant and [is] inadmissible.\"\nGreenidge v. Ruffin, 927 F.2d 789, 792 (4th Cir. 1991).\n      13\n      Defendants argue that in order to make the leaving cover\nevidence admissible, we must segment that action out from all other\n\n                                      -34-\n\fGraham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396 (1989); Abraham v. Raso, 183\n\nF.3d 279, 291 (3d Cir. 1999).    The district judge's admission of\n\nthe evidence was appropriate.\n\n          Defendants also argue that the only possible unreasonable\n\naction by Solitro was leaving cover and that was not enough to\n\nraise a jury question as to the objective unreasonableness of\n\nSolitro's use of force, as a matter of law.   Cf. Napier v. Town of\n\nWindham, 187 F.3d 177, 188 (1st Cir. 1999) (fact that officers\n\nsnuck up to suspect's house did not create jury question in\n\nexcessive force case where officers unquestionably acted reasonably\n\nin the few moments immediately surrounding the shooting).   A jury\n\n\nacts and determine whether there was a constitutional duty for\nSolitro to maintain cover during the armed confrontation. This is\nincorrect, and relies on a misreading of our precedent in St.\nHilaire and Napier v. Town of Windham, 187 F.3d 177 (1st Cir.\n1999). St. Hilaire did not adopt a rigid segmentation approach\nbetween events leading up to a shooting and the shooting itself,\nbut merely separated out a pre-shooting issue analytically for\npurposes of qualified immunity, because of the concern for fair\nnotice to officers in such cases. See St. Hilaire, 187 F.3d at 27-\n28.\n     And Napier, which was also a qualified immunity case,\nindicated only that the pre-shooting actions at issue in that case\n-- the officers' creeping up to the plaintiff's house with their\nguns drawn to investigate a complaint that someone had been\nshooting on that property -- did not make their actions in the\nmoments immediately surrounding the shooting unreasonable. Napier,\n187 F.3d at 188. The pre-shooting conduct at issue in Napier was\nfar more remote from the shooting than the conduct here. Napier\nthen stated that, in certain cases, pre-confrontation conduct\nitself could serve as the unreasonable conduct on which a section\n1983 claim could be based, if that conduct was independently\nconstitutionally mandated. Id. at 188-89. Napier does not hold\nthat events immediately leading up to a shooting cannot be\nconsidered as part of the totality of the circumstances along with\nthe precise instant surrounding a shooting.\n\n                                -35-\n\fcould have found, inter alia, that the officers' misidentification\n\nof Cornel by itself was unreasonable, as well as the rapidity with\n\nwhich they shot Cornel.   The defendants' real claim is that the\n\nleaving of cover lacked a sufficient causal nexus to the shooting\n\nof Cornel to be admissible evidence -- defendants argued at trial\n\nand here that the causal relationship was simply too \"remote.\"\n\nSuch questions of proximate cause are generally best left to the\n\njury; so here.   See, e.g. Wortley v. Camplin, 333 F.3d 284, 295\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (\"Proximate causation and intervening cause are\n\nusually issues for the jury to resolve.\").\n\n          Indeed, defendants state in their briefs that they would\n\n\"tend to agree\" that evidence of Solitro's failure to take cover\n\nwould be relevant if Diaz, and not Cornel, had been shot by the\n\npolice after Diaz brandished a weapon.       Here, of course, when\n\nSolitro left cover, he knew that Diaz was a threat but had not seen\n\nCornel yet.   Still, an armed confrontation had commenced, and the\n\nissue of whether Solitro's leaving cover was causally related to\n\nthe shooting of Cornel was appropriately left, as the district\n\njudge did, to the jury.     There was no abuse of discretion in\n\nadmitting the evidence.    The Solitro verdict in phase one will\n\nstand.\n\n          To the extent that the defendants make an argument that\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to support a jury verdict that\n\nSolitro violated Cornel's constitutional rights by using excessive\n\n\n                               -36-\n\fforce against him, the challenge fails.              The test for whether the\n\nuse   of   deadly   force     is   excessive    is   whether   an   objectively\n\nreasonable officer would believe that the suspect posed a \"threat\n\nof serious physical harm either to the officer or others.\" Garner,\n\n471   U.S.   at   12;   see   also   Abraham,    183    F.3d   at   289.    Most\n\nimportantly, there was evidence presented at the phase one trial\n\nthat Cornel was identifying himself as a police officer, was\n\nholding his gun with two hands as a police officer would, and was\n\nimmediately recognized by bystanders as an off-duty officer.                  We\n\nthink that a jury could find that an objectively reasonable officer\n\nwould have recognized Cornel as an officer, and thus would have\n\nrecognized that he was not a threat and would not have shot him.\n\nThere was also evidence that Cornel's gun was pointed downwards,\n\nand not at Diaz or anyone else, and that the officers shot him\n\nextraordinarily quickly, almost immediately after he left the\n\nrestaurant, and without giving him adequate warning.\n\n2. Plaintiff's Challenge to the Saraiva Verdict of No\n   Constitutional Violation -- Pro Hac Vice Revocation\n\n             Young argues that the Saraiva verdict should be vacated\n\nbecause two members of her legal team, including lead counsel\n\nScheck, were removed in the middle of the phase one trial.                 In the\n\ncompanion case Scheck v. City of Providence, No. 04-1334, issued\n\nthis same day, we held that the revocation of the pro hac vice\n\nstatus of Young's counsel was improper and reversed, reinstating\n\nthe pro hac vice status of the two lawyers.\n\n                                      -37-\n\f           Young argues initially that reversal of the Saraiva\n\nverdict should be automatic, and no prejudice need be demonstrated.\n\nThe    Supreme   Court   has   never   decided    whether   erroneous\n\ndisqualification of chosen counsel in either criminal or civil\n\ncases automatically results in reversal of a judgment in that case,\n\nor whether harmless error analysis is employed.       See Richardson-\n\nMerrell, Inc. v. Koller, 472 U.S. 424, 438 (1985); Rodriguez v.\n\nChandler, 382 F.3d 670, 673 (7th Cir. 2004).     This Circuit has held\n\nthat in a criminal case, erroneous denial of the sole counsel of\n\nchoice mandates reversal even absent any showing of prejudice. See\n\nUnited States v. Panzardi-Alvarez, 816 F.2d 813, 818 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).14\n\n           The Panzardi-Alvarez rule does not, by its terms, carry\n\nover into the civil context.    Panzardi-Alvarez is also factually\n\ndistinguishable because here the party continued to be represented\n\nby at least one member of her chosen team of counsel and was not\n\n\n      14\n      We note that Panzardi-Alvarez predates much of the Supreme\nCourt's recent reshaping of harmless error doctrine. See, e.g.,\nBrecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 629-30 (1993); Arizona v.\nFulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 306-312 (1991).       Courts which have\nrecently tackled the question of whether harmless error analysis\napplies when a criminal defendant has been erroneously deprived of\nchosen counsel have reached somewhat varying results.      Compare,\ne.g., United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 399 F.3d 924 (8th Cir. 2005)\n(harmless error analysis inapplicable to erroneous denial of pro\nhac vice admission for criminal defendant's sole chosen counsel),\nwith Chandler, 382 F.3d at 675-76 (holding that at least on\ncollateral review, deprivation of one member of criminal\ndefendant's chosen team of lawyers must involve prejudice in order\nfor defendant to obtain reversal, and adopting an \"adverse effect\"\nstandard).\n\n                                -38-\n\fforced to bring in new counsel.           In a criminal case, a defendant\n\nerroneously    deprived    of   chosen     counsel   has    suffered   a   Sixth\n\nAmendment violation, See Panzardi-Alvarez, 816 F.2d at 818; Kevlik\n\nv. Goldstein, 724 F.2d 844, 850 (1st Cir. 1984).                   The Sixth\n\nAmendment does not apply to civil cases and therefore we have held\n\nthat there is no such constitutional protection for denial of\n\nchosen counsel in a civil case.           See Kevlik, 724 F.2d at 848-49.15\n\nIn this case, Young has not been deprived of any constitutional\n\nright through the district judge's disqualification of some of her\n\nlegal team.    Counsel have been reinstated.         We will not reverse the\n\nunderlying verdict, in addition to reinstating the lawyer, absent\n\nsome showing of prejudice pertinent to that verdict.\n\n           We need not define the exact standard of prejudice in\n\nthis case because we find it highly probable that the erroneous\n\nrevocation of the pro hac vice admission of two members of Young's\n\nlegal team did not affect the outcome of the verdict in favor of\n\nSaraiva.      The   two   lawyers   who    were   removed    continued     to   be\n\navailable to assist the remaining lawyer, Robert Mann, and Mann\n\ncontinued to contact them, outside of the courtroom, because of\n\ntheir knowledge about the case.              Mann was considered by the\n\n\n     15\n      At least one court has held that erroneous denials of a civil\nlitigant's chosen counsel can raise constitutional issues through\nthe Fifth Amendment's Due Process clause.     See In re BellSouth\nCorp., 334 F.3d 941, 955 (11th Cir. 2003).      We think it rare,\nalthough perhaps possible, that a denial of a civil party's chosen\ncounsel could rise to the level of a Fifth Amendment violation.\nCertainly there was no such violation here.\n\n                                     -39-\n\fdistrict judge to be very competent. The local rules required Mann\n\n-- as local counsel -- to be deeply involved in all proceedings in\n\nthe case conducted by pro hac vice counsel.     See D.R.I. Local R.\n\n5(c)(2).   Mann was offered a continuance by the district court and\n\nhe in fact took such a continuance.    By virtue of the continuance,\n\nthe judge's desire to give Mann \"leeway,\" and for other reasons,\n\nthere was a break of one week between the removal and the bulk of\n\nthe additional testimony.16   Mann noted that he had never tried a\n\nMonell case; however, he is a highly skilled trial lawyer and he\n\nwas not trying the Monell portion of the case in phase one, but\n\nonly a relatively straightforward § 1983 excessive force case.\n\n           Moreover, the removal occurred towards the very end of\n\nplaintiff's case in chief.     As to the defense case, Mann had\n\nparticipated extensively in the depositions of defendants' fact\n\nwitnesses at the scene. Defendants' case was quite short (a little\n\nmore than two days of testimony) and consisted almost entirely of\n\nsuch fact witnesses.   Finally, we stress that Young was partially\n\nsuccessful -- the jury found that Solitro had violated Cornel's\n\nconstitutional rights -- and there were important differences\n\n\n\n     16\n      Dr. Fyfe, however, testified the day after the removal. One\nof the key claims of prejudice made by the plaintiff was that Mann\nwas unprepared to proceed with examining Fyfe and unfamiliar with\nthe substance of his testimony. But the district judge did offer\nto allow Mann a continuance to prepare his examination. Plaintiffs\ndeclined that continuance because of Fyfe's limited availability.\nFurther, Fyfe's testimony focused mainly on Solitro; Solitro, of\ncourse, was found to have violated Cornel's constitutional rights.\n\n                                -40-\n\fbetween the actions of Solitro and Saraiva (who was found not to\n\nhave violated Cornel's rights), as Young herself points out in her\n\nreply brief to this court.          Solitro left cover; Diaz's testimony\n\nabout the officers' erratic behavior was directed primarily at\n\nSolitro's actions; and Solitro was closer to Cornel than Saraiva\n\nand had an unobstructed view of him because he had no cover.\n\n              The Saraiva verdict, like the Solitro verdict, is\n\nupheld.\n\n                                      IV.\n\nA. Municipal Liability Against the City of Providence\n\n            Liability against the City of Providence is premised on\n\nMonell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), which\n\nheld that a municipality could be liable in certain cases when its\n\nagents and employees committed constitutional violations, but not\n\nunder a theory of respondeat superior.         Id. at 691-95.   Instead, it\n\nis   only    when    the   governmental     employees'    \"execution     of   a\n\ngovernment's policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury\" and is the\n\n\"moving     force\"   behind   the    constitutional      violation     that   a\n\nmunicipality can be liable.17        Id. at 694.\n\n\n     17\n      We quickly dispose of a preliminary argument. Defendants\nRyan and Cohen argue that Young's voluntary dismissal of Solitro\nand Saraiva as defendants, with prejudice, acts as a judgment that\nSolitro and Saraiva did not violate Cornel's constitutional rights,\nand this in turn bars liability against Providence or the\nsupervisors, since such liability can only be premised on an\nunderlying constitutional violation by Solitro and Saraiva. This\nis without merit.      Young's claim against the municipal and\nsupervisory defendants is not an attempt to adjudicate Solitro and\n\n                                     -41-\n\f            Assessing liability against the City requires two basic\n\nelements:    first,   that   plaintiff's   harm   was   caused   by     a\n\nconstitutional violation, and second, that the City be responsible\n\nfor that violation, an element which has its own components.\n\nCollins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 120 (1992).18        The\n\nfirst element is satisfied here because the jury found that Solitro\n\n-- although not Saraiva -- violated Cornel's constitutional rights\n\nby using excessive force against him.      The question at issue here\n\nis whether Providence is responsible for that violation.              The\n\nfinding that Solitro violated Cornel's constitutional rights is\n\nnecessary for any finding that the City is liable, see City of Los\n\n\n\nSaraiva's own rights or obtain a judgment binding on them. See,\ne.g., Wilson v. Town of Mendon, 294 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002)\n(individual can sue city for Monell liability without also\nproceeding against officers who committed underlying constitutional\nviolation).    Ryan and Cohen are therefore trying to use the\nvoluntary dismissal of Solitro and Saraiva for issue preclusive,\nrather than claim preclusive, effect.         While the voluntary\ndismissal surely had claim preclusive effect and barred any attempt\nto re-litigate the same claim against Solitro and Saraiva, see\nUnited States v. Cunan, 156 F.3d 110, 114 (1st Cir. 1998), it did\nnot have any issue preclusive effect on the factual question\nwhether Solitro and Saraiva violated Cornel's constitutional rights\nbecause this issue was never actually litigated and decided, see,\ne.g., Amadeo v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 290 F.3d 1152, 1159\n(9th Cir. 2002).\n     18\n      The sorts of Monell claims being alleged here -- based on\ndeficient training and hiring that helped cause the constitutional\nviolation suffered by Cornel -- should not be confused with the\nkind of claim that occurs where a municipal policy itself violates\nfederal rights or directs or authorizes the violation of those\nrights. See Brown v. County Comm'rs of Bryan County, 520 U.S. 397,\n406-07 (1997). The standards in the latter sort of cases are quite\ndifferent.\n\n                                 -42-\n\fAngeles v. Heller, 475 U.S. 796, 799 (1986); Evans v. Avery, 100\n\nF.3d 1033, 1039-40 (1st Cir. 1996), and thus causally, any basis\n\nfor municipal liability must run through Solitro's actions.                 The\n\nactions taken by Solitro that constituted excessive force must\n\nsomehow have been caused -- at least in part -- by the City's\n\nfailure to train, or erroneous hiring of, Solitro.               Since Saraiva\n\ndid not use excessive force against Cornel, any claim hinged on the\n\nCity's failure to train or discipline Saraiva must fail.              For that\n\nreason, the district court correctly granted summary judgment for\n\nthe City on the claim of inadequate discipline -- there is no\n\nallegation that Solitro was inadequately disciplined by Providence\n\nat any point before the shooting of Cornel.\n\n           The Supreme Court, concerned that municipal liability\n\nbased on fault by the City might collapse into de facto respondeat\n\nsuperior, has set a very high bar for assessing municipal liability\n\nunder   Monell.      The   alleged   municipal     action   at     issue   must\n\nconstitute a \"policy or custom\" attributable to the City.                  See,\n\ne.g.,   Silva   v.   Worden,   130   F.3d   26,   31-32   (1st    Cir.   1997).\n\nFurther, the Supreme Court has imposed two additional requirements:\n\n1) that the municipal policy or custom actually have caused the\n\nplaintiff's injury, and 2) that the municipality possessed the\n\nrequisite level of fault, which is generally labeled in these sorts\n\nof cases as \"deliberate indifference.\" See Brown v. County Comm'rs\n\nof Bryan County, 520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997); see also Bordanaro v.\n\n\n                                     -43-\n\fMcLeod, 871 F.2d 1151, 1161-63 (1st Cir. 1989).                      Causation and\n\ndeliberate indifference are separate requirements, although they\n\nare often intertwined in these cases.\n\n             We   will   address,    in       turn,    Young's    claims   based   on\n\nProvidence's      allegedly    deficient        training    program     and   hiring\n\nprocedures.\n\n1. Training\n\n             The Supreme Court stated in City of Canton v. Harris, 489\n\nU.S. 378 (1989), that an allegation of a local government's failure\n\nto   train    police      officers      who     then    violate     a   plaintiff's\n\nconstitutional rights can be actionable where \"the failure to train\n\namounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with\n\nwhom the police come into contact\" and where \"the identified\n\ndeficiency in a city's training program [is] closely related to the\n\nultimate injury.\"        Id. at 388, 391.\n\n             At   the    outset,   we    agree    with     the   district     court's\n\nreasoning that any proper allegation of failure to train must be\n\naimed at Solitro's lack of training and not at the deficiencies in\n\nSaraiva's or Cornel's training, and must allege that Solitro's lack\n\nof training caused him to take actions that were objectively\n\nunreasonable and constituted excessive force on the night he shot\n\nCornel.      Such a theory, when the evidence is looked at most\n\nfavorably to the plaintiff, can be made out in this case: a jury\n\ncould find that Solitro's shooting of Cornel was unreasonable,\n\n\n                                        -44-\n\finter alia, because he should have recognized Cornel as an off-duty\n\nofficer (due to Cornel's demeanor and verbal commands) or not shot\n\nCornel so rapidly without making sure of his identity.                          A jury\n\ncould find that Solitro made such mistakes because of the PPD's\n\nlack    of       training   on     on-duty/off-duty      interactions,      avoiding\n\nmisidentifications of off-duty officers, and other issues relating\n\nto the City's always armed/always on-duty policy.                     Further, a jury\n\ncould find that this training deficiency constituted deliberate\n\nindifference to Cornel's rights.\n\n                 We reject one argument Young has used to advance the\n\nresult we do reach.           The district court is correct in saying that\n\nthe issue is not whether Cornel's death was caused by his own lack\n\nof     proper      training      in    identifying     himself   or    otherwise      in\n\nconducting himself while off-duty.19                See Young, 301 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n182.    Collins establishes that a city worker has no constitutional\n\nright       at   all   to   adequate       training;    thus,    there    can    be   no\n\nindependent         claim     of      constitutional    violation     separate     from\n\nSolitro's use of excessive force.                  See Collins, 503 U.S. at 130.\n\nWhile the objective reasonableness test for excessive force is not\n\nblind to the actions of the victim, the victim's actions are\n\n\n       19\n      This does not necessarily mean that evidence of Cornel's and\nSaraiva's lack of training is irrelevant; such evidence might be\nrelevant to show that Solitro's lack of training was part of a\npolicy of not training on on-duty/off-duty interactions, rather\nthan simply an \"otherwise sound program [that] has occasionally\nbeen negligently administered.\"    Canton, 489 U.S. at 391.     We\nexpress no view on this question.\n\n                                            -45-\n\finvariably considered from the officer's perspective and taken as\n\ngiven; the question is whether the officer's responses to the\n\nactions of the victim were objectively reasonable.       The jury,\n\nemploying this view, has found Solitro's actions unconstitutional.\n\n             We do, though, disagree with the district court's\n\nconclusion that, based on Melaragno's and Boehm's testimony, no\n\njury could find that the training program given to officers under\n\nthe policy for identification of off-duty officers was deliberately\n\nindifferent to the constitutional rights of off-duty officers like\n\nCornel. It is true that a training program must be quite deficient\n\nin order for the deliberate indifference standard to be met: the\n\nfact that training is imperfect or not in the precise form a\n\nplaintiff would prefer is insufficient to make such a showing. See\n\nCanton, 489 U.S. at 391; Grazier v. City of Philadelphia, 328 F.3d\n\n120, 125 (3d Cir. 2003); Palmquist v. Selvik, 111 F.3d 1332, 1345\n\n(7th Cir. 1997) (where town gave police officers some training on\n\nhandling suspects exhibiting abnormal behavior, argument that even\n\nmore training should have been given failed).\n\n          We need not decide whether the training described by\n\nMelaragno and Boehm, if fully credited, would be sufficient to\n\nnegate any possible inference of deliberate indifference, because\n\nwe think the district court ignored genuine disputes of fact about\n\nwhether this training ever took place.   The testimony of Melaragno\n\nand Boehm may be self-serving: they may be trying to protect the\n\n\n                               -46-\n\fdepartment or personally avoid blame for deficient training.       That\n\nalone does not make it untrue.      What calls the testimony into\n\nquestion is that the described training was not documented and the\n\ntestimony of other witnesses is in conflict with the testimony of\n\nMelaragno and Boehm.    Young presented evidence that the general\n\npolicy of the PPD was to document training, and yet for unclear\n\nreasons any on-duty/off-duty training was evidently undocumented.\n\nFurther, Ryan stated that he would know of any \"substantial\" off-\n\nduty training that Melaragno supervised.        This testimony either\n\nacts to contextualize the extent of the training described by\n\nMelaragno and Boehm as a proportion of total training or creates a\n\nflat conflict with the statements of Melaragno and Boehm.          Some\n\nofficers recalled little or no training on on-duty/off-duty issues.\n\nSolitro   recalled   Range   2000   training,    but   Melaragno    and\n\nCommissioner Partington were uncertain about the extent to which\n\nRange 2000 actually dealt with off-duty issues. Finally, Boehm and\n\nMelaragno themselves disagree about some of the training at issue.\n\nIn short, there are substantial unresolved issues of fact with\n\nrespect to the amount of training that the PPD actually gave to\n\nofficers, including Solitro, on avoiding misidentifications of off-\n\nduty officers.    The jury could find that there was, at best, very\n\nminimal training on these issues, and no real program of training\n\non them at all.\n\n\n\n\n                                -47-\n\f               A finding of deliberate indifference requires also that\n\nthe City have disregarded a known or obvious risk of serious harm\n\nfrom its failure to develop a training program that dealt with off-\n\nduty identifications in the context of its always armed/always on-\n\nduty policy.             We think the jury could reasonably make such a\n\nfinding here.             Such knowledge can be imputed to a municipality\n\nthrough a pattern of prior constitutional violations.                                   See Brown,\n\n520 U.S. at 407-08; see also Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 11 (1st\n\nCir. 1997); Palmquist, 111 F.3d at 1346.                                Young does not rely\n\nprimarily on this sort of notice, although she does have some\n\nevidence from which a jury could find that it was common knowledge\n\nwithin       the    PPD    that       misidentifications               of       off-duty    officers\n\nresponding          to     an       incident      often      occurred             in   Providence,\n\nparticularly misidentification of minority officers.                                   It is clear\n\nthat     a    jury       could       find    a    pattern         of    knowledge          of   prior\n\nmisidentifications and that this was likely to pose a significant\n\nrisk of harm.\n\n               We have stated that \"[t]he Supreme Court has left open\n\nthe possibility that a failure-to-train claim can succeed without\n\nshowing a pattern of previous constitutional violations.\"                                       Swain,\n\n117 F.3d at 11 (citing Brown, 520 U.S. at 409).                                 In fact, the Court\n\nhas suggested            that       liability     without     such          a    pattern    will   be\n\nappropriate         \"in        a    narrow   range      of   circumstances,\"               where   \"a\n\nviolation          of    [a]       federal   right[]\"        is    \"a       highly     predictable\n\n\n                                                 -48-\n\fconsequence of a failure to equip law enforcement officers with\n\nspecific tools to handle recurring situations.\" Brown, 520 U.S. at\n\n409; see Canton, 489 U.S. at 390 & n.10 (\"[C]ity policymakers know\n\nto a moral certainty that their police officers will be required to\n\narrest fleeing felons.       The city has armed its officers with\n\nfirearms . . . .         Thus, the need to train officers in the\n\nconstitutional limitations on the use of deadly force . . . can be\n\nsaid to be 'so obvious' that failure to do so could properly be\n\ncharacterized    as   'deliberate    indifference'   to   constitutional\n\nrights.\"); see also Allen v. Muskogee, 119 F.3d 837, 844-45 (10th\n\nCir. 1997); Robles v. City of Fort Wayne, 113 F.3d 732, 735 (7th\n\nCir. 1997).    We think a jury could find deliberate indifference by\n\nvirtue of this route here.\n\n            Although there was no evidence of a prior friendly fire\n\nshooting, a jury could find from the testimony of Commissioner\n\nPartington, Melaragno, and Boehm that the department knew that\n\nthere was a high risk that absent particularized training on\n\navoiding off-duty misidentifications, and given the department's\n\nalways armed/always on-duty policy, friendly fire shootings were\n\nlikely to occur.      A jury could conclude that the severity of the\n\nconsequences of a friendly fire shooting forced the department to\n\ntake notice of the high risk despite the rarity of such an\n\nincident.     Dr. Fyfe's report could lead the jury to conclude that\n\nit was common knowledge within the police community that the risk\n\n\n                                    -49-\n\fof friendly fire shootings with an always armed/always on-duty\n\npolicy was substantial, and it was also common knowledge that\n\nparticularized     training   on    on-duty/off-duty       interactions   (and\n\nparticularly on the risk of misidentifications) was required to\n\nlessen this risk.20 Beyond Dr. Fyfe, the statements of Commissioner\n\nPartington and Ryan could support a view that the City knew its\n\ntraining program to be seriously deficient.            We think, in short,\n\nthat the jury could find that the department knew that a friendly\n\nfire    shooting   in   violation    of     the   Fourth   Amendment    was    a\n\npredictable consequence of the PPD's failure to train on on-\n\nduty/off-duty interactions, and therefore that the department was\n\ndeliberately indifferent to Cornel's constitutional rights.\n\n            Defendants finally argue causation as a basis to affirm\n\nsummary judgment on the training claim in their favor.                        The\n\ncausation issue is close. The Supreme Court has stated that courts\n\nmust be very careful in assessing causation and must apply a\n\nstringent standard: \"the identified deficiency in a city's training\n\nprogram must be closely related to the ultimate injury.\"               Canton,\n\n489 U.S. at 391; see Brown, 520 U.S. at 409-410.                  As we have\n\nstated, the verdict in phase one reflects that Solitro acted in an\n\n\n\n       20\n      The district court declined to consider the Fyfe report on\nsummary judgment both because it was unsworn and because it was\nconclusory. See Young, 301 F. Supp. 2d at 177. The report was\nsworn to with an affidavit, and thus that ground for disregarding\nthe report was error. The aspects of the report on which we rely\ncould properly have been testified to by Fyfe.\n\n                                     -50-\n\fobjectively unreasonable fashion for an officer.    The jury could\n\nconclude that Solitro was not trained by the PPD to know that there\n\ncould be off-duty officers at a scene, responding to the same\n\nincidents, whom on-duty officers must take pains to identify.    A\n\njury could find that training would have made a difference here,\n\nunlike in other situations where it would have been unlikely to\n\nstop unconstitutional conduct. See, e.g., Barney v. Pulsipher, 143\n\nF.3d 1299, 1308 (10th Cir. 1998) (training claim failed because\n\ntraining would be unlikely to stop jailer from sexually assaulting\n\ninmates); Robles, 113 F.3d at 736.\n\n          The testimony of Commissioner Partington and Melarango\n\nestablishes that even though identification of off-duty officers\n\nmight appear to be a matter of common sense, in situations of high\n\nstress such as where an officer is evaluating the threat level of\n\nan unknown individual armed with a gun, officers tend to fall back\n\non their training.    They could find that if Solitro had, for\n\nexample, been instructed that he was likely to encounter off-duty\n\npolice officers while on-duty himself, had seen many situations\n\ninvolving off-duty officers in range and scenario training, and had\n\nbeen instructed on the kinds of actions that off-duty officers\n\nwould take to attempt to identify themselves, then he would have\n\nproperly recognized Cornel as an off-duty officer and would not\n\nhave shot him.\n\n\n\n\n                               -51-\n\f            We reverse the grant of summary judgment against Young on\n\nthe failure to train claim.    We remand this claim for trial.21\n\n2. Hiring\n\n            It is much harder for a Monell plaintiff to succeed on a\n\nhiring claim than a failure to train claim.   See Brown, 520 U.S. at\n\n409 (\"The proffered analogy between failure-to-train cases and\n\n\n     21\n      Providence makes several confusing arguments based on the\nundisputed requirement under Monell that a municipal policy or\ncustom be involved in order to make a municipality liable. See,\ne.g., Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 U.S. 701, 737 (1989);\nCity of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 123-25 (1988)\n(plurality opinion); Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469,\n481-83 (1986); Baron v. Suffolk County Sheriff's Dept., No. 03-\n2718, 2005 WL 708338, at 11-13 (1st Cir. March 29, 2005).\nProvidence does not dispute that the jury could find that the\nalways armed/always on-duty requirement is a policy of the City\npromulgated by an official policymaker. A jury could further find\nthat this policy poses substantial risks of harm which are inherent\nbut which risks could be minimized by proper training.       A jury\ncould also conclude from the testimony of Commissioner Partington\nthat there was a Providence policy or custom of not training PPD\nofficers on the inherent risks of the always armed/always on-duty\npolicy (and how to avoid them) in a way that was deliberately\nindifferent and caused the violation of Cornel's constitutional\nrights. And although it is unclear whether Chief Prignano was a\nfinal policymaker for the municipality on PPD training issues,\nCommissioner Partington clearly was such a final policymaker: as\nCommissioner of Public Safety he had been delegated broad\npolicymaking authority over PPD procedures by the municipality.\n     We again leave for another day the question left open in\nBaron, which is whether a court in a Monell case involving an\nallegation of a culpable \"custom\" -- not policy -- must explicitly\nlink that custom to a final policymaker in order to make a\nmunicipality liable.     See Baron, 2005 WL 708338, at *12-13\n(allegation of culpable municipal policy requires that court\nexplicitly find a final policymaker, but it is unclear whether\nfinal policymaker must be explicitly identified in a custom case).\nIn this case, a jury could find either a policy or custom of\nfailure to train on the risks of the always armed/always on-duty\npolicy; the jury could also attribute either the policy or custom\nto Commissioner Partington.\n\n                                 -52-\n\finadequate screening cases is not persuasive.\").          This is because\n\nit is especially difficult, with a hiring claim, to find both\n\ncausation (that the hiring decision caused the constitutional\n\ndeprivation of the plaintiff in a particularized sense) and fault\n\n(that the hiring decision reflected deliberate indifference to the\n\nparticular constitutional right at issue of the plaintiff).           See,\n\ne.g., Barney, 143 F.3d at 1308.              Further, hiring claims are\n\nespecially likely to collapse into a species of respondeat superior\n\nliability, if not checked by particularly stringent standards. See\n\nBrown, 520 U.S. at 410.\n\n           The Supreme Court has stated that it is unclear whether\n\na single hiring decision due to inadequate screening can ever lead\n\nto Monell liability.         Id. at 412.       If it can, however, the\n\nplaintiff would need to show that, if the City had performed a full\n\nreview of the hired officer's record, the particular constitutional\n\nviolation committed by the hired officer would have been a \"plainly\n\nobvious consequence\" of the hiring decision by the municipality.\n\nId. at 412-13; see also Morris v. Crawford County, 299 F.3d 919,\n\n924-25 (8th Cir. 2002); Gros v. City of Grand Prairie, 209 F.3d\n\n431, 435 (5th Cir. 2000); Barney, 143 F.3d at 1308-09.                This\n\nstandard is exceptionally stringent.           Solitro's record included\n\nseveral complaints of excessive force while restraining juveniles,\n\nand he had an expunged conviction for assaulting Small, an off-duty\n\nminority   officer.    But    \"even   when    an   applicant's   background\n\n\n                                  -53-\n\fcontains    complaints   of   physical     violence,   including   acts   of\n\naggression and assault,\" this may still be insufficient to make a\n\nCity liable for inadequate screening of an officer who then uses\n\nexcessive force.     See Morris, 299 F.3d at 924; see also Brown, 520\n\nU.S.   at   413-14   (officer's    record    insufficiently   related     to\n\nexcessive force complaint even where it included a conviction for\n\nassault and battery).\n\n            At any rate, we need not decide this issue on which the\n\nCity so heavily relies.       Although Brown itself is focused on the\n\n\"actual background of the individual applicant,\" it cannot be that\n\nthe \"thoroughness or adequacy of the municipality's review of the\n\napplication\" is irrelevant.       See Barney, 143 F.3d at 1308 n.7. The\n\nprocedures involved in the review of Solitro's application, on the\n\nundisputed facts, were not sufficiently inadequate to raise a jury\n\nquestion as to Providence's deliberate indifference.          A background\n\ncheck was performed, the background investigator spoke to two of\n\nSolitro's supervisors at the juvenile facility and received good\n\nreviews, and the Small incident came to light and was discussed at\n\nSolitro's oral interview before the hiring board.         That procedures\n\nwere flawed does not make Providence deliberately indifferent to\n\nthe risk that Solitro would use excessive force.\n\n            Finally, Young attempts to remove her hiring claim from\n\nthe ambit of the \"single incident\" facts discussed in Brown by\n\nstating that here, the PPD's hiring procedures were generally\n\n\n                                    -54-\n\fdeficient.    She points to evidence that background investigators\n\nwere untrained, that background checks were not received by the\n\nmembers of the oral board, and that background checks were ignored\n\nby the policymakers.    She also points to evidence of one violent\n\nindividual whose name kept coming up on the applicant list due to\n\ncorruption, but who was never actually hired.            Given the logic of\n\nBrown, this is not the sort of hiring pattern that could lead to an\n\ninference of deliberate indifference.22         See Synder v. Trepagnier,\n\n142 F.3d 791, 796 (5th Cir. 1998) (analyzing hiring claim as a\n\nsingle incident case under Brown despite allegation that \"the\n\nCity's    hiring   policies     were     [generally]    deficient   because\n\ncandidates'   backgrounds     were     inadequately    investigated.\").   A\n\npattern of previous bad hiring decisions leading to constitutional\n\nviolations (perhaps of the same type as the one at issue) would\n\nlikely be necessary to get one outside the \"single incident\"\n\nanalysis in Brown.    See Brown, 520 U.S. at 409-11.\n\n           We affirm summary judgment for the City on Young's\n\ndeficient hiring claim.       The recent trend of Supreme Court cases,\n\nwhich use very particularized notions of causation and fault, make\n\n\n     22\n      We note, as well, that many of the general deficiencies in\nhiring procedures that Young points to have no causal relationship\nto the hiring of Solitro, and they thus have no causal relationship\nto the shooting of Cornel. It made no difference to Solitro that\nbackground checks were not seen by the oral board, for the\nbackground check on Solitro contained no disqualifying information.\nLikewise, the fact that negative background checks were ignored has\nno causal relationship to Solitro's hiring, again because his\nbackground check did not uncover any problems.\n\n                                     -55-\n\fit unlikely that the training claim and the hiring claim could be\n\ncombined into one mishmash, despite the hiring claim's inability to\n\nsurvive on its own, and given to the jury.               See, e.g., Brown, 520\n\nU.S. at 406-07.       Even if, in some cases, it might be appropriate to\n\ncombine the two claims, see Bordanaro v. McLeod, 871 F.2d 1151,\n\n1159 (1st      Cir.    1989)    (combining     Monell   claims   that   city   had\n\ninadequate \"recruitment, training, supervision and discipline\" of\n\nits police force), this is not such a case.                      Throughout the\n\nproceedings below and here (save for a brief mention at oral\n\nargument), Young has argued the training, hiring, and discipline\n\npoints separately.\n\nB. Supervisory Liability and Qualified Immunity\n\n            Young asserts claims against Prignano, Sullivan, Ryan,\n\nand Cohen for supervisory liability.               See, e.g., Camilo-Robles v.\n\nHoyos,   151    F.3d    1,     6-7   (1st   Cir.   1998);   Maldonado-Denis     v.\n\nCastillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581-82 (1st Cir. 1994).                   These\n\nindividual defendants ask that the summary judgment granted in\n\ntheir favor be affirmed.             We decline to do so.        The issues are\n\nbetter addressed by the district court.\n\n               We have reversed entry of summary judgment against\n\nProvidence on the failure to train claim, a consideration pertinent\n\nto qualified immunity analysis.              The district court never dealt\n\nwith qualified immunity issues -- it made no rulings on the second\n\nprong of qualified immunity analysis, whether both the underlying\n\n\n                                        -56-\n\fconstitutional violation of Solitro and the basis for liability of\n\nthe various supervisors were clearly established, nor did it make\n\nany rulings on the third prong, whether the supervisors' actions\n\nwere otherwise objectively reasonable.23   See Camilo-Robles, 151\n\nF.3d at 6-8.   Further, the record on qualified immunity issues is\n\nnot well developed and the briefing on appeal is inadequate. Thus,\n\nthe most prudent course is to vacate the grant of summary judgment\n\nin favor of the four supervisory defendants, premised on the\n\nerroneous grant of summary judgment to Providence, and remand.   We\n\ndo not address the issue of supervisory liability here.\n\n                                V.\n\n          The phase one verdict that Solitro violated Cornel's\n\nconstitutional rights while Saraiva did not is affirmed.   On phase\n\ntwo, the grant of summary judgment in Providence's favor on Young's\n\n§ 1983 failure to train claim based on the training of Solitro is\n\nreversed, and that claim is remanded for trial.     The grants of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Providence on all other § 1983 claims\n\nagainst it -- based on Saraiva and Cornel's training, Solitro's\n\nhiring, and Saraiva's discipline -- are affirmed.    The grants of\n\n     23\n      In its May 30, 2003 ruling on Sullivan and Prignano's initial\nmotion for summary judgment, the district court held that the two,\nin their motion, never raised any qualified immunity issues that\nwent beyond the merits of the case; in its February 11, 2004 ruling\non Ryan, Cohen, and Providence's subsequent motion for summary\njudgment, the district court did not reach qualified immunity\nbecause it held that the disposition of the claims against\nProvidence effectively disposed of the supervisory claims -- on the\nmerits -- as well. Young, 301 F. Supp. 2d at 183-84.\n\n                               -57-\n\fsummary judgment against Young on the § 1983 supervisory claims\n\nagainst    Prignano,    Sullivan,   Ryan,   and   Cohen   are    vacated   and\n\nremanded    to   the   district   court.    The   case    is    remanded   for\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.24\n\n\n\n\n     24\n      Young challenges various discovery orders made by the\ndistrict court refusing requests for (1) records concerning\nmisidentification of officers by civilians or other officers, (2)\narrest and incident reports reflecting PPD officers taking off-duty\naction, (3) discipline records concerning off-duty conduct of PPD\nofficers, and (4) data and statistics on racial profiling. We see\nno abuse of discretion in the denial of these discovery requests.\nThe third and fourth items are irrelevant given Young's legal\ntheory.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).        While some of the\ninformation in the first and second items could have relevance to\nthis case, the sweeping breadth in the way these requests were\nframed adequately justified denial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2).\nYoung also challenges orders declining a request to make former\nProvidence Mayor Cianci give more specific answers to deposition\nquestions and declining to force the current PPD chief to be\ndeposed at all.    There was no abuse of discretion here either;\nneither witness is relevant to Young's case.\n     Young also challenges a denial of her motion to amend the\ncomplaint to add a supervisory claim against Ryan for his\ninvolvement in the hiring process. This challenge is moot, given\nthat we have affirmed summary judgment against Young on her claim\nthat Providence was liable for deficient hiring; Young has put\nforth no separate theory that would lead to supervisory liability\nagainst Ryan based on hiring.\n     Young never asks us to rule on whether the district court's\nuse of a local rule, D.R.I. Am. Gen. Order 2002-01, to limit the\ntotal length of legal memoranda to 10 pages for most motions and 20\npages for motions for summary judgment, and to limit the length of\nsupporting appendices and exhibits submitted with those memoranda\nby use of the same (10 and 20) page restrictions, was appropriate.\nWe do not reach this question.\n\n                                    -58-\n\f",

In January 2000, two on-duty\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island, police officers, Michael Solitro and\n\nCarlos Saraiva, while responding to a call, shot and killed an off-\n\nduty Providence police officer, Cornel Young (\"Cornel\"), who was\n\nattempting to respond to the same incident under a city policy (the\n\n\"always armed/always on-duty\" policy) that required him to act\n\ndespite being off-duty and out of uniform.                   The two on-duty\n\nofficers, who are white, apparently mistook Cornel, an African-\n\nAmerican, for a threat.\n\n            Cornel's mother, Leisa Young (\"Young\"), filed suit in\n\nfederal court, as administratrix of her son's estate, against\n\nSolitro and Saraiva for use of excessive force during the course of\n\na seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution; she later dismissed these officers as parties to the\n\ncase but sought to hold others liable for the shooting.            Young sued\n\nthe City of Providence and various Providence Police Department\n\n(\"PPD\")   supervisors,     alleging    that   they    were   responsible    for\n\nSolitro's and Saraiva's underlying excessive force violation due to\n\ntheir deficient training, hiring, and discipline of these two\n\nofficers.\n\n            After the first phase of a bifurcated trial, the jury\n\nfound that Officer Solitro, but not Officer Saraiva, had violated\n\nCornel's constitutional rights by using excessive force against\n\nhim.      The   district   court   then     granted   summary    judgment    to\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fProvidence and the supervisors, holding that there was insufficient\n\nevidence        that   these    defendants       a)    caused      the    underlying\n\nconstitutional violation by Solitro and b) possessed the requisite\n\nlevel of fault (deliberate indifference) to allow the case to go to\n\na jury.    Young appealed; certain defendants cross-appealed.\n\n               After a thorough review of the evidence, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court in part and reverse in part.                   The jury verdict in\n\nthe first phase of the case -- finding that Solitro, but not\n\nSaraiva, violated Cornel's constitutional rights -- stands against\n\nchallenges from both sides.             We also affirm the district court's\n\ngrant     of    summary    judgment     against       Young   on    a    claim    that\n\nProvidence's screening of Solitro before hiring him constituted\n\ndeliberate indifference by the City to Cornel's constitutional\n\nrights (the \"hiring claim\").

It is plaintiff's burden to make that demonstration.\n\nWe    hold   that     there    is     enough     evidence    that    the    City     was\n\ndeliberately indifferent in its training and lack of protocols in\n\nthis area     and     that    the     training    deficiencies      and    absence    of\n\nprotocols were causally linked to Solitro's use of excessive force\n\nagainst Young that a reasonable jury could find in Young's favor on\n\nthis training and lack of protocol claim (the \"training claim\").\n\nA jury could also rationally conclude in defendant's favor, but\n\nthat is not the test on summary judgment.

We describe later the titles and roles of each of\n\nthese individual defendants.\n\n           On January 24, 2003, defendants Prignano and Sullivan\n\nmoved for summary judgment on the merits of the supervisory claims\n\nagainst them.    This initial motion was granted in part and denied\n\nin part on May 30, 2003.     The district court held that Sullivan was\n\nentitled   to   summary    judgment    on   claims   that   he    inadequately\n\n\n     1\n      Plaintiff also alleged a Monell claim against Urbano\nPrignano, Jr., in his official capacity as allegedly being final\npolicymaker for the City; the district court considered this claim\nas functionally identical to the claims against the City and did\nnot otherwise treat it. See Young v. City of Providence, 301 F.\nSupp. 2d 163, 173 n.12 (D.R.I. 2004).     This claim has not been\nraised by any party on appeal and we do not discuss it.\n\n                                      -6-\n\finvestigated an incident involving Solitro's assault of a minority\n\nofficer when hiring Solitro and that he failed to discipline\n\nSaraiva after a prior shooting.        Other claims against Sullivan\n\nconnected with the hiring of Solitro, however, could go forward,\n\nand hiring, training, and disciplinary claims against Prignano also\n\nsurvived.    Regarding the training claim, the court noted that\n\nplaintiff's evidence suggested that \"the department lacked policies\n\nconcerning the manner in which off-duty officers were to identify\n\nthemselves or to initiate action\" and that \"at best, only minimal\n\noff-duty response training was provided at the police academy.\"2\n\nSome additional evidence was taken between the date of this order\n\nand the subsequent final order where the district court granted\n\nsummary judgment for all municipal and supervisory defendants.\n\n            Solitro and Saraiva moved for summary judgment as to the\n\nclaims against them on March 12, 2003.     The district court granted\n\nthis motion in part and denied it in part on July 1, 2003.       The\n\ncourt held that the excessive force claims against the two officers\n\n\n\n     2\n      The court correctly rejected Prignano's attempt to avoid\nsupervisory liability by stating that he was not a final, official\nmunicipal policymaker under Monell, 436 U.S. at 690 n.55, as the\ncourt noted that this was irrelevant for purposes of supervisory\nliability against Prignano in his personal capacity.\n     The court also refused to entertain Prignano and Sullivan's\nasserted qualified immunity defense.      The court stated that\nPrignano and Sullivan did not make any effort to argue the various\nprongs of qualified immunity analysis (particularly whether the\nright they allegedly violated was clearly established and whether\ntheir conduct was objectively reasonable), and in truth were\nrelying solely on the merits.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fsurvived summary judgment, particularly given that there were\n\nfactual disputes surrounding how Cornel was holding his gun and\n\nwhether he verbally identified himself as an officer in Solitro and\n\nSaraiva's presence.\n\n           On August 13, 2003, Solitro and Saraiva moved for a\n\nseparate trial pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b), seeking to have\n\nthe claims against them severed from the claims against the other\n\ndefendants.       On September 12, 2003, the court granted Young's\n\nmotion to voluntarily dismiss Solitro and Saraiva as defendants\n\nfrom the case, in return for Saraiva and Solitro dropping their\n\nmotion to bifurcate the trial.          However, the other defendants had\n\nmeanwhile joined the motion for a bifurcated trial, and the court\n\ngranted   their    motion   on   the   same   day.   The   court   correctly\n\ninterpreted the case law as stating that even without Solitro and\n\nSaraiva in the case as defendants, any liability against the City\n\nand the supervisory defendants would need to be conditioned on a\n\nfinding that at least one of the officers (Solitro or Saraiva)\n\nviolated Cornel's underlying constitutional right to be free of\n\nexcessive force during the course of a seizure.            Thus, the court\n\nruled that the trial would proceed in two phases: phase one would\n\ndetermine whether Solitro and/or Saraiva had violated Cornel's\n\nconstitutional rights, and, if the answer on phase one were yes for\n\nat least one of the officers, phase two would determine whether\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fthere was any basis for holding Providence and/or the supervisory\n\ndefendants liable for this constitutional violation.\n\n          Phase one of the jury trial commenced on October 8, 2003,\n\nand lasted about three weeks.   Plaintiff presented testimony from\n\nSolitro and Saraiva, several civilian witnesses from the night of\n\nthe shooting (January 28, 2000), and Dr. James Fyfe, an expert on\n\npolice tactics, who offered expert testimony that both Solitro's\n\nleaving cover behind the police cruiser and Saraiva's failure to\n\ninstruct him to maintain cover were contrary to accepted police\n\nstandards in a situation like the one at issue because those\n\nactions substantially raised the risk that police officers would\n\neither be shot or would need to shoot others.   Fyfe's testimony on\n\ncover was admitted over the objections of the defendants. The jury\n\ninstructions included an instruction that \"[i]n considering whether\n\nSolitro and/or Saraiva acted reasonably, you may . . . consider the\n\nevents leading up to the shooting.\"      On October 31, the jury\n\nreturned a special verdict, finding by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that Solitro shot Cornel in violation of the latter's\n\nconstitutional rights, but that Saraiva did not do so.\n\n          As we explain in our companion opinion in Scheck v. City\n\nof Providence, No. 04-1334, issued this same day, the pro hac vice\n\nstatus of two members of plaintiff's three-person legal team,\n\nincluding lead counsel Barry Scheck, was revoked mid-trial (at the\n\nend of the day on October 17), and the third member was forced to\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fconduct much of the trial alone.

See id. at 173.   Moreover, the court held\n\nthat any evidence that the City had failed to train Cornel to deal\n\nwith off-duty situations was irrelevant, given that Cornel had no\n\nconstitutional right to training.      See id. at 182.   The claim\n\nagainst Providence based on failure to train Solitro failed to\n\nsurvive summary judgment for three reasons: 1) there was inadequate\n\nspecific evidence that the training program was deficient, 2) there\n\nwas insufficient evidence of deliberate indifference, and 3) there\n\nwas insufficient evidence of causation.    See id. at 177-78.   The\n\ncourt relied on the training outlined in deposition by Steven\n\nMelaragno and Robert Boehm, two officers who ran the firing range\n\nfor PPD recruits, as evidence that the City did provide training on\n\nissues relating to off-duty/on-duty interactions.

The court held that the report submitted by Dr. James Fyfe,\n\nplaintiff's expert witness on police training, was unsworn, and\n\nthus should not be considered; at any rate, even if it were\n\nconsidered, it was merely \"conclusory\" and \"not of sufficient\n\nevidentiary quality.\"    Id. at 177.\n\n          The court held that the claim against Providence for\n\ndeficient hiring procedures in the hiring of Solitro also failed to\n\n\nlaw claims has been waived.\n\n                                -11-\n\fsurvive the high standards set out for such claims in Board of\n\nCounty Commissioners of Bryan County v.

Finally, the supervisory claims against Ryan, Cohen,\n\nPrignano,      and   Sullivan   failed     because    Young's     theories   of\n\nsupervisory liability were factually and legally indistinguishable\n\nfrom her theories of municipal liability against Providence.

The dispatch was\n\n                               -13-\n\ffor \"females fighting at Fidas\" and was designated a Code 2 call;\n\nCode 2 meant an \"urgent\" call and represented the middle range of\n\nurgency in the PPD's dispatch system, between a Code 1 call, which\n\nrepresented an \"emergency\" call and Code 3, which represented a\n\n\"routine\" call.       Solitro was an eight-day rookie on the force;\n\nSaraiva was a three-year veteran and was informally acting as\n\nSolitro's training officer.\n\n            As the officers drove up to the restaurant in their\n\npatrol car, they saw a man (later identified as Aldrin Diaz)\n\nrunning towards the door of a Chevrolet Camaro, which he then\n\nentered.    After the police had pulled up about 8 to 12 feet from\n\nthe Camaro and while they were still in the police cruiser, Solitro\n\nand Saraiva saw Diaz pointing a gun out the window of the Camaro;\n\nSolitro then said \"gun\" to Saraiva.        That was the only word the two\n\nofficers exchanged during the entire incident. Saraiva and Solitro\n\ngot out of their car; Saraiva took cover behind some poles while\n\nSolitro took cover behind the engine block and front wheel of the\n\npolice     cruiser.      Both   officers     yelled   commands   at   Diaz\n\nsimultaneously: they told him to drop the gun and to get out of the\n\ncar.   The officers could see that Diaz no longer had the gun in his\n\nhands and was starting to get out of the car by the time that the\n\nofficers saw Cornel.\n\n            Saraiva never moved from his position until the end of\n\nthe incident.    Solitro, after a few seconds in a position of cover\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fbehind the cruiser, left this position of cover and walked into an\n\nopen spot directly in front of the Camaro.   He stated that he did\n\nthis because his cover behind the patrol car was imperfect, because\n\nhe wanted to get a better look at the Camaro, because he wanted to\n\nmake a rapid arrest of Diaz, and because he wanted to keep Diaz\n\nguessing. Plaintiff's expert witness, Dr. James Fyfe, an expert on\n\npolice tactics, testified that Solitro's leaving of cover was\n\n\"inconsistent with accepted police practices\" because it made\n\nSolitro far more vulnerable and therefore made it more likely that\n\ndeadly force would have to be used by Solitro and Saraiva in order\n\nto defend Solitro.\n\n           Meanwhile, Cornel, an off-duty PPD officer, had been\n\ninside the restaurant as a customer.    Civilian witnesses located\n\ninside the restaurant testified that they saw Cornel run through\n\nthe restaurant at around the time the police arrived, yelling\n\n\"police, police\" or \"police, get out of the way\" very loudly.   They\n\nsaw him run through the doors of the restaurant as he continued to\n\nyell \"police,\" and then heard him yell, \"freeze.\"   Cornel left the\n\nrestaurant within a few seconds of the arrival of Solitro and\n\nSaraiva.   A jury could easily find that Cornel was acting pursuant\n\nto the always armed/always on-duty policy of the PPD.\n\n           Diaz, the man who had dropped the gun at police command,\n\nwas located outside the restaurant at the time.   He testified that\n\nhe saw Cornel walk out of the restaurant holding his gun and scream\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f\"freeze.\"       Diaz stated that he could tell that Cornel was a police\n\nofficer, from his verbal command, his body language, and his\n\ndemeanor.       There was then some movement by someone at the scene.\n\nDiaz stated that Cornel made a quarter turn and faced Diaz, but\n\nCornel's gun was pointing at an angle downwards in front of Cornel\n\nand not towards Diaz or anyone else.           Diaz also stated that Cornel\n\nwas screaming other verbal commands during and after the quarter\n\nturn, but Diaz was not paying attention and did not understand\n\nthem.\n\n               Joseph Hayman, another civilian witness located outside\n\nthe restaurant        who    was   involved   in   the   altercation   that     had\n\nprompted the initial dispatch call, testified as well that he heard\n\nCornel yell \"freeze\"; Hayman then turned to look at Cornel. Hayman\n\ntestified that upon hearing this command, he figured the speaker\n\nwas a cop, given the tone of the voice, and he responded to the\n\ncommand by putting his hands up.           He further testified that Cornel\n\nwas holding his gun with two hands, as a police officer would,\n\nrather than sideways with one hand (a technique called \"gangster-\n\nstyle\" by some of the witnesses).              Hayman, like Diaz, testified\n\nthat       Cornel   turned   but   never   began   to    approach   Diaz   or   the\n\nofficers.5\n\n\n       5\n      There were disputes of fact on virtually all of the critical\npoints testified to by Diaz, Hayman, and the witnesses inside\nFidas. For example, Solitro and Saraiva testified that they never\nheard Cornel say anything, and Saraiva further testified that\nCornel was deliberately walking towards Diaz and Solitro and that\n\n                                       -16-\n\f            A witness inside Fidas testified that he heard the shots\n\nthat killed Cornel being fired only \"[a] second\" after Cornel had\n\nleft the restaurant; he referred to the timing of the shots after\n\nCornel had left the restaurant as \"instant.\"     Diaz testified that\n\nCornel was shot a \"couple of seconds\" after he made the quarter\n\nturn.   Hayman agreed that Cornel was shot immediately after he\n\nbegan to turn.\n\n            Saraiva and Solitro both testified that they both yelled,\n\nsimultaneously, \"drop the gun\" or \"drop it\" more than once.    It is\n\nundisputed that they never prefaced their commands with the word\n\n\"police.\"   Then, both officers shot Cornel multiple times, killing\n\nhim: Saraiva and Solitro testified that Saraiva shot first, and\n\nSolitro shot immediately thereafter.     Diaz testified:\n\n            [The two officers were] shooting and screaming\n            at the same time . . . . And . . . Solitro,\n            he's like hysterical moving. . . . [H]e was\n            like running in place like.      His feet was\n            moving, and he's shooting and he's like\n            shooting with both hands, one hand. And he's\n            just freaking out, screaming out at the top of\n            his head.\n\n            The jury found Solitro, but not Saraiva, to have violated\n\nCornel's constitutional rights.\n\n\n\n\nhis gun was aimed at Diaz, not down towards the ground. Further,\nSaraiva testified that Cornel was holding the gun with one hand,\nsideways. These disputes of fact, of course, were for the jury to\nresolve.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fB.

John\n\nPartington, a civilian, held that position for the relevant periods\n\nin this case. The Commissioner is statutorily \"responsible for the\n\nadministration and discipline of the police department\" and has\n\n              authority to make all rules and regulations\n              necessary for the efficiency, management and\n              direction of the police department.

The PPD chief of police, Urbano\n\nPrignano, Jr., during the relevant periods for this case, was\n\nappointed by the Commissioner and served at his direction.           Id.\n\nLack of Specific Protocols and Training\n\n              Young argues that Solitro and Saraiva's excessive force\n\nagainst Cornel was caused by a lack of training provided by the\n\nCity and certain supervisors who have been named as defendants --\n\nPrignano, the PPD Chief of Police at all times when Solitro,\n\n                                   -18-\n\fSaraiva, and Cornel were on the force; John Ryan, the head of the\n\ntraining academy     when   Saraiva   and   Cornel   attended   it   as   new\n\nrecruits, and Kenneth Cohen, the head of the training academy when\n\nSolitro attended it as a new recruit. Specifically, plaintiff\n\nargues that given the City's always armed/always on-duty policy,\n\nwhich was known to be a dangerous policy, the PPD was required to\n\nhave protocols and give training on various aspects of the policy,\n\nparticularly the issue of avoiding misidentification of off-duty\n\nofficers.6\n\n             The always armed/always on-duty policy as it existed at\n\nthe time of Cornel's shooting stated as follows:\n\n             Except when on annual leave, a member shall be\n             armed at all times while off duty . . . .\n             A member shall act in his official capacity if\n             he becomes aware of an incident which requires\n             immediate police action and time is of the\n             essence to safeguard life or property. While\n             off duty, a member who takes police action . .\n             . shall be considered to be in an on-duty\n             status . . . .\n             Should an off-duty member become aware of an\n             incident which requires police action, and\n             life or property is not endangered, he shall\n             report the incident to the appropriate . . .\n             agency for action.\n\nPPD Regs. §§ 202.1, 202.2. The relevant regulations further stated\n\nas follows:\n\n             Duty status -- Although certain workday hours\n             are allotted to every member of the force for\n             the performance of specific workday duties, a\n\n\n     6\n      Young has made no argument that the City failed to train on\nissues of cover.\n\n                                  -19-\n\f            member of the force shall be in an \"on duty\"\n            status at all times for the preservation of\n            the peace and the protection of life, liberty\n            or property.

Melaragno was in charge of\n\nfirearms training at the training academy's firing range for new\n\nrecruits and for current officers (who go through periodic \"in\n\nservice\" training); Boehm worked under Melaragno at the range.\n\nMelaragno stated that both in-service and new recruit training\n\nwould include paintball \"simunition\" scenarios, and the goal of the\n\ntraining was to gauge the training officer's response whether to\n\nshoot or hold fire.    Training would include multiple scenarios, at\n\nleast one of which would be a no-shoot situation: this no-shoot\n\nsituation might, but need not, involve an off-duty officer as the\n\npotential target (it could also include an innocent bystander, like\n\na store owner).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f            Melaragno also stated that training included a Range 2000\n\nvideo    simulator,    which   would   confront   officers   with   virtual\n\nscenarios.     Officers injected into a troublesome situation (say a\n\nvehicle stop or an injured officer) would determine which commands\n\nto give and which tactics to use; if they made certain choices,\n\nshooting might be required.      Melaragno was uncertain if any of the\n\nfive or six Range 2000 scenarios specifically dealt with situations\n\ninvolving off-duty officers, although they certainly did deal with\n\nother types of no-shoot situations.7       Partington, the Commissioner\n\nof the PPD during the relevant period, testified that in his view,\n\nRange 2000 did not specifically deal with the problem of \"friendly\n\nfire\" due to off-duty misidentifications.\n\n             Melaragno testified more generally that new recruits are\n\ntaught that when taking action off-duty, they always need to\n\nidentify themselves by displaying their badge and firearm, and\n\ncalling out that they are \"on the job.\"       He testified that some of\n\nthis training occurred at the firing range, but some occurred in\n\nclassroom training that was provided in conjunction with firing\n\nrange training.       Melaragno testified initially in his deposition\n\nthat this off-duty classroom training was integrated into a series\n\n\n\n     7\n      Melaragno stated that there were some static targets a few\nminutes before the video scenarios began, which were used as warmup\nfor the officers.    These included plainclothes officers wearing\nbadges along with hostile targets and bull's eyes, but Melaragno\nsaid that he \"really d[id not] consider them\" since they were\nstatic.\n\n                                   -21-\n\fof seven lectures on officer survival (the lectures were on issues\n\nlike cover).    However, he testified later in the same deposition\n\nthat there was a separate, eighth lecture on off-duty issues.\n\nBoehm told a grand jury investigating the Cornel shooting that\n\nofficers were never \"directly\" taught that they needed to display\n\ntheir badge with their gun when taking action off-duty; this is\n\nsomething they would pick up \"inferentially\" from other training,\n\nsuch as the paper cutout training described below.\n\n           Boehm stated at his deposition that there were several\n\nhours of training at the academy for new recruits at a live firing\n\nrange involving paper cutouts -- the officers once again had to\n\ndecide whether to shoot or not.          Some of these cutouts were dressed\n\nup like plainclothes officers with badges.            Further, all recruits\n\nwent to Camp Varnum, a training facility that was set up like a\n\nsmall city: recruits, who played on-duty officers, responded to\n\nfake dispatch calls where scenarios played out.             Five or six of\n\nthese scenarios involved off-duty officers (never played by the\n\nrecruits) who were jumping out of cars quickly, moving quickly to\n\nget their badges, or running into situations where police were\n\ninvestigating suspicious persons.           The recruits' reactions to the\n\nunexpected emergence of off-duty officers were critiqued with an\n\ninstructor after each scenario had been completed.\n\n           Still, the testimony of Melaragno and Boehm was disputed.\n\nThere   were   two   themes   to   the    factual   disputes.   First,   the\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\ftestimony of Melaragno and Boehm as to off-duty training was not\n\ndocumented in any form, as might be expected had it occurred.\n\nSecond, other witnesses testified that no pertinent training took\n\nplace.\n\n          Both Melaragno and defendant Ryan, head of the PPD police\n\ntraining academy for several years, agreed that it was essential to\n\ndocument training,    and    both   stated   that    there    was,   in   fact,\n\nsubstantial documentation of other aspects of training.              Melaragno\n\nstated that the training scenarios described were not documented\n\nbecause of an \"oversight\"; he admitted that this violated the basic\n\npro-documentation policy of the academy.            He also testified that\n\ndocumentation   of    classroom       training       on      on-duty/off-duty\n\ninteractions, along with other material from that piece of the\n\ncurriculum (officer survival week), had simply been lost.\n\n          Further, Ryan testified at deposition inconsistently with\n\nthe testimony of Melaragno and Boehm, as did other witnesses. Ryan\n\ntestified that the only kind of academy training on on-duty/off-\n\nduty interactions that he knew about was his own class on civil\n\nliability training: he taught officers that because of possible\n\nexposure to liability, it was better if they did not take police\n\naction off-duty (in express contravention of the department's\n\nwritten policy).     He emphasized that this training focused on\n\nliability concerns and did not discuss safety.            He stated that he\n\nwould know   about   any    other   training   on   off-duty     issues    that\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\foccurred at the academy, except for training on internal affairs by\n\na Sergeant Bennett (on avoiding misconduct by drinking too much\n\noff-duty, etc.) and training on firearms by Melaragno.                He stated\n\nfurther that he would know about any \"substantial training\" by\n\nMelaragno on on-duty/off-duty interactions and misidentifications,\n\nand he did not know of any.\n\n          Defendant Cohen, who was head of the academy when Solitro\n\nattended, testified that he did not know one way or the other\n\nwhether training on on-duty/off-duty interactions existed.\n\n          One PPD police officer, Shane Romano, recalled that there\n\nwas no training on officers identifying themselves while off-duty.\n\nAnother   officer,    Greg    Small,   mentioned      Range    2000    training\n\nregarding off-duty altercations.           Solitro, when asked whether he\n\nhad any training on on-duty/off-duty identification issues, also\n\ncited some Range 2000 training that he had while at the academy.\n\nHe recalled no other specific training on off-duty issues, although\n\nhe agreed that \"[t]here may have been some off-duty issues raised\n\nhere and there in terms of questions and answers but no [specific]\n\ncourse on it.\"       Saraiva recalled some training involving paper\n\ncutouts that represented off-duty officers at the range; he noted\n\nthat this involved no interaction with off-duty officers.\n\n           Prignano,    the   PPD   police    chief   during    the    relevant\n\nperiod, stated that in his view, off-duty officers are taught at\n\nthe academy to identify themselves by showing their badge, but at\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fany rate, this identification protocol is \"common sense,\" and\n\n\"[you] can't teach common sense.\"8             Chief Prignano's testimony\n\ncould be understood to mean that there was no pertinent training\n\nbecause no training was needed, as identification issues were\n\nsimply a matter of common sense.\n\nNecessity of Specific Protocols and Training\n\n                Commissioner Partington agreed with the assessment of\n\nplaintiff's expert, Dr. James Fyfe, that \"off-duty encounters, and\n\nthe risk they might be interrupted by on-duty police, are a well-\n\nrecognized hazard of urban policing for which officers must be\n\ncarefully schooled by policy and training.\"             He agreed with Fyfe\n\nthat       an   always   armed/always     on-duty   policy   was   inherently\n\ndangerous, and that given the department's always armed/always on-\n\nduty policy, specific training and a protocol were necessary to\n\navoid friendly fire shootings of off-duty officers.                He further\n\nagreed with Fyfe that \"[w]here such training and policy do not\n\nexist, it can be expected that off-duty officers will intervene\n\nunwisely, that on-duty officers will mistake them for suspects, and\n\nthat unnecessary blood will be shed by the public and by officers.\"\n\n                More specifically, Commissioner Partington testified that\n\ninteractions between on-duty and off-duty officers were very high\n\nstress situations, and training was needed for the very high stress\n\n\n       8\n      Despite Prignano's belief, there was evidence that certain\nofficers did not understand that department policy required them to\ncarry their badges with them while off-duty.\n\n                                        -25-\n\fsituations that officers face, since officers tend to fall back on\n\ntheir training in these situations.         Partington agreed with Fyfe\n\nthat training on off-duty/on-duty misidentification must, inter\n\nalia,   \"[p]rovide    instruction     on   the    risks    associated     with\n\nencountering other law enforcement personnel while taking off-duty\n\naction\" and \"[s]ensitize officers to the possibility that, while\n\ntaking on-duty action, they may encounter off-duty personnel.\" Yet\n\nPartington testified that the only PPD training on off-duty/on-duty\n\ninteractions he was aware of was that an officer should not get\n\ninvolved while off-duty unless a situation is life threatening\n\n(which is contrary to the language of the policy and the testimony\n\nof many other witnesses).     He testified that the PPD also offered\n\nRange 2000 training, but admitted that, in his view, this did not\n\n\"deal[] with the problem of friendly fire incidents.\"\n\n            Melaragno also emphasized the need for particularized\n\ntraining    on   on-duty/off-duty    interactions.         Melaragno     stated\n\nsimilarly   that   on-duty/off-duty    interactions       were   high    stress\n\nsituations, and even though the correct actions might seem like\n\ncommon sense, training was required because \"under periods of high\n\nstress sometimes you need to make sure someone understands what\n\nthey need to do.\"    Melaragno further stressed the very substantial\n\npotential    for   tragic   consequences    (as    in     this   case)    if   a\n\nmisidentification occurs.     Boehm testified that given the severity\n\nof a friendly fire incident, he knew that the department had to\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\ftrain to avoid such an incident despite the lack of prior friendly\n\nfire shootings in the City.\n\n             Plaintiff presented numerous reports from police officers\n\nof past misidentifications of off-duty personnel in Providence,\n\nparticularly    involving   minority   officers,   and   thus,   presented\n\nevidence that the department was on notice of a misidentification\n\nproblem.     Indeed, both Cornel and his police officer father had\n\nbeen the subject of misidentifications in the past.        None of these\n\nearlier incidents had a violent or tragic outcome.\n\n             Plaintiff's expert, Dr. James Fyfe, wrote a report for\n\nthis case based on his understanding of standard police practice\n\nand his research into other friendly fire shootings.         Fyfe is the\n\nDeputy Commissioner for Training of the New York City Police\n\nDepartment and an authority on police tactics and training, with a\n\ndoctorate in criminal justice from the State University of New York\n\nat Albany.    He has reviewed more than 10,000 police shootings over\n\nthe course of his career.     Fyfe wrote that always armed/always on-\n\nduty policies such as the PPD policy at issue here were well-known\n\nto carry a high risk of \"fatal consequences for off-duty officers,\"\n\nlargely because \"minimally competent police administrators have\n\nlong recognized that there is a great distinction between officers'\n\ncapacity to act forcibly while on-duty and their ability to do so\n\noff-duty.\"     Thus, always armed/always on-duty policies \"must be\n\naccompanied by training such as that described in [his research],\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fand that specifies a protocol designed to avoid apparent friendly\n\nfire tragedies such as occurred in this case.\"         Absent such\n\ntraining, it can be expected that on-duty officers will mistake\n\noff-duty officers attempting to intervene in a situation for\n\nsuspects, which will lead to unnecessary bloodshed.\n\n          There was testimony that the need to train on the always\n\narmed/always on-duty policy was heightened by the fact that there\n\nwas some evidence that officers were sometimes unclear what exactly\n\nthe policy required.   Commissioner Partington was, before seeing\n\nthe written text of the policy, under the erroneous impression that\n\nit only required action when there was a life threatening situation\n\nand that off-duty police action was only used as a last resort.\n\nAnd Ryan, as stated above, taught off-duty officers never to take\n\npolice action, for liability reasons.\n\n          The PPD changed the always armed/always on-duty policy in\n\n2001, after the Cornel shooting, so that officers were no longer\n\nrequired to carry firearms while off-duty.    The new policy also\n\nclarified that off-duty officers would sufficiently fulfill their\n\nobligations under the policy by reporting an incident to police,\n\nand provided a specific protocol for any off-duty action that was\n\ntaken.\n\nHiring\n\n          Young also argues that Providence is liable for hiring\n\nSolitro without conducting an adequate background investigation.\n\n\n                               -28-\n\fAs well, Young asserts supervisory claims connected with this\n\nmunicipal claim, against both Prignano and Major Richard Sullivan\n\n(who was head of the oral hiring board, an institution described\n\nbelow, when Solitro was hired).\n\n          There is evidence that Solitro, who was a former employee\n\nat a juvenile detention facility, used excessive force against\n\nresidents at the juvenile facility several times while attempting\n\nto restrain them, and was disciplined for this at least once.\n\nThere was further evidence that he was repeatedly absent from his\n\nwork, that he broke a pool table, that he ripped a phone off the\n\nwall because he was angry with a juvenile, and that the facility\n\nmade Solitro see a counselor weekly for six months for anger\n\ncontrol treatment.    Solitro had also assaulted Detective Greg\n\nSmall, an off-duty African-American police officer, and referred to\n\nhim by using a racial slur, in the parking lot of a club in 1989;\n\nSolitro pled no contest to a simple assault charge and his record\n\nwas later expunged.\n\n          A background check on Solitro was conducted by a PPD\n\ndetective Oscar Perez in accordance with a standard form packet\n\nissued by the PPD; there is a written copy of these forms, filled\n\nout, in Solitro's case.     The background check consisted of an\n\ninterview of Solitro, his wife, his neighbors, and two supervisors\n\nat the juvenile facility.     The first supervisor stated, as a\n\nresponse to form questions, that she found Solitro's work at the\n\n\n                               -29-\n\ftraining school satisfactory, that she would rehire him, that he\n\nwas the type of person that she would like to see as a police\n\nofficer in her town, and that if her son or daughter were in\n\ntrouble with the authorities, Solitro was someone that she would\n\nlike to have handle the case.   Further, she noted that Solitro \"has\n\ngained a lot of experience on this job\" and \"would make . . . a\n\ngood   police   officer.\"    Perez   spoke   to   this   supervisor   for\n\napproximately 10 or 15 minutes.      She also told Perez that one of\n\nSolitro's duties was to restrain juveniles; Perez may or may not\n\nhave specifically asked whether he acted improperly in this role.\n\nThe supervisor told about a near \"riot\" incident in the juvenile\n\nfacility that Solitro had appropriately brought under control. She\n\ndid not specifically discuss Solitro's disciplinary history with\n\nPerez: she stated later (after the shooting of Cornel) that she\n\nthought this information was confidential, that there was another\n\nway for the PPD to request it, and that therefore she could not\n\ndiscuss it during the interview.        The PPD never requested or\n\nreceived a copy of Solitro's personnel file from this juvenile\n\nfacility.\n\n            The second supervisor interviewed stated that Solitro was\n\nan \"honest guy\" who \"would do a good job\" as a police officer.\n\nThere is evidence that one of Solitro's other supervisors, Brian\n\nTerry, who was not interviewed, was concerned about Solitro's\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\ffitness and called an officer on the force who was his uncle to\n\ndiscuss the matter.\n\n            The background check was only a piece of Solitro's\n\nevaluation during the hiring process. 2,200 applicants applied for\n\nplaces in the 57th and 58th PPD recruit classes: only 48 recruits\n\nwere selected for the 57th police academy (including Saraiva and\n\nCornel), while only 22 officers (including Solitro) were selected\n\nfor the 58th class. Solitro had to pass a written test and an\n\nagility test, and once he did so he was interviewed by a three-\n\nperson oral review board, which ranked the candidates.         This\n\nranking determined the order in which candidates were admitted to\n\nthe academy.   Psychological testing was also performed.   There is\n\nevidence that Small spoke with defendant Sullivan, the officer in\n\ncharge of the oral hiring board for Solitro's academy, before\n\nSolitro was hired, and told Sullivan about the assault.    Sullivan\n\nraised the issues with Solitro before the oral board.9\n\n            Young argues that the decision to hire Solitro was part\n\nof a pattern of inadequate screening by the PPD when hiring new\n\nofficers.    Several detectives who performed background checks at\n\none time or another as part of their duties, including Perez,\n\nstated that they had no training on how to conduct them.   A brief,\n\n\n     9\n      Before the board, Solitro stated that he had a fight with\nSmall but did not know that he was a police officer at the time.\nSullivan believed the story partly because Solitro was charged with\nsimple assault, rather than the more significant crime of knowingly\nassaulting a police officer.\n\n                                -31-\n\fthree-page set of guidelines on conducting background checks was\n\nprovided with the background check packets used in screening\n\nSolitro's class. There was also evidence that neither Prignano nor\n\nSullivan received or read background checks -- Prignano stated that\n\nSullivan, as head of the hiring board, should have brought any\n\nconcerns to him after reviewing the background check in conjunction\n\nwith other materials, while Sullivan said that he never saw the\n\nbackground investigations and did not know who considered them.\n\nEvidence existed as well that some candidates whom background\n\ninvestigators recommended be rejected were subsequently accepted to\n\nlater academy classes without any consultation with the original\n\nbackground investigator who wrote the negative report.10\n\n           Finally,     there    was   some      evidence    of      generalized\n\ncorruption in the PPD's hiring and promotions practices.               Officers\n\nseeking promotions were allowed to cheat on certain promotional\n\nexams.    Further, there is evidence that one applicant for a PPD\n\nposition benefitted from a bribe: despite officials knowing that he\n\nhad a series of arrests and an expunged criminal record for\n\nimpersonating   a     police    officer    and    being     caught    near   his\n\ngirlfriend's cabin with a rifle, the applicant was not removed from\n\n\n     10\n      Many of these policies were changed after the Cornel\nincident.    Partington and a new Chief of Police (Sullivan)\ninstituted more thorough background investigations (particularly\nregarding searches for expunged criminal records), began training\nbackground investigators on how to conduct their investigations,\nand ensured that oral hiring boards had access to the results of\nbackground investigations.\n\n                                    -32-\n\fthe   academy   list.    Partington     eventually   ensured   that   the\n\nindividual's name was removed from the list and he was never\n\nhired.11\n\n                                III.\n\nChallenges to the Phase one Verdicts\n\n            Both Young and the defendants raise challenges to the\n\nphase one jury verdicts.     Defendants challenge the verdict that\n\nSolitro violated Cornel's constitutional rights; Young challenges\n\nthe verdict that Saraiva did not.       We address these challenges in\n\nturn, ultimately determining that there is no need to disturb the\n\njury's verdicts.\n\n1. The Defendants' Challenge to the Solitro Verdict of\n   Constitutional Violation\n\n            Ryan and Cohen argue strenuously that the Solitro verdict\n\nmust be overturned because of the erroneous admission of testimony\n\nthat Solitro left cover, and in particular the testimony of Dr.\n\nFyfe, which focused on assessing the propriety of Solitro's leaving\n\ncover.     This argument is incorrect; the court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in admitting this evidence. Likewise, the court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in instructing the jury that \"events leading\n\n\n      11\n      Young also asserts a third set of facts as a possible basis\nfor municipal and supervisory liability (against Prignano and\nSullivan). Plaintiff argues that the PPD's failure to discipline\nSaraiva after a prior incident in which he pepper sprayed a crowd\nand shot a civilian reflected deliberate indifference that caused\nCornel's death.    But because we uphold the jury's finding that\nSaraiva did not violate Cornel's constitutional rights, we need not\nrecount any of the facts about this claim.\n\n                                 -33-\n\fup to the shooting\" could be considered by it in determining the\n\nexcessive force question.\n\n             The rule in this circuit is that once it is clear that a\n\nseizure has occurred, \"the court should examine the actions of the\n\ngovernment officials leading up to the seizure.\"                 St. Hilaire v.\n\nCity of Laconia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709033\"><a href=\"/opinion/709033/kathy-st-hilaire-etc-v-city-of-laconia/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26 (1st Cir. 1995).

A jury\n\n\nacts and determine whether there was a constitutional duty for\nSolitro to maintain cover during the armed confrontation. This is\nincorrect, and relies on a misreading of our precedent in St.\nHilaire and Napier v. Town of Windham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198593\"><a href=\"/opinion/198593/napier-v-windham/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir.\n1999). St. Hilaire did not adopt a rigid segmentation approach\nbetween events leading up to a shooting and the shooting itself,\nbut merely separated out a pre-shooting issue analytically for\npurposes of qualified immunity, because of the concern for fair\nnotice to officers in such cases. See St. Hilaire, 187 F.3d at 27-\n28.\n     And Napier, which was also a qualified immunity case,\nindicated only that the pre-shooting actions at issue in that case\n-- the officers' creeping up to the plaintiff's house with their\nguns drawn to investigate a complaint that someone had been\nshooting on that property -- did not make their actions in the\nmoments immediately surrounding the shooting unreasonable. Napier,\n187 F.3d at 188. The pre-shooting conduct at issue in Napier was\nfar more remote from the shooting than the conduct here. Napier\nthen stated that, in certain cases, pre-confrontation conduct\nitself could serve as the unreasonable conduct on which a section\n1983 claim could be based, if that conduct was independently\nconstitutionally mandated. Id. at 188-89. Napier does not hold\nthat events immediately leading up to a shooting cannot be\nconsidered as part of the totality of the circumstances along with\nthe precise instant surrounding a shooting.\n\n                                -35-\n\fcould have found, inter alia, that the officers' misidentification\n\nof Cornel by itself was unreasonable, as well as the rapidity with\n\nwhich they shot Cornel.   The defendants' real claim is that the\n\nleaving of cover lacked a sufficient causal nexus to the shooting\n\nof Cornel to be admissible evidence -- defendants argued at trial\n\nand here that the causal relationship was simply too \"remote.\"\n\nSuch questions of proximate cause are generally best left to the\n\njury; so here.   See, e.g. Wortley v. Camplin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200518\"><a href=\"/opinion/200518/wortley-v-camplin/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 295\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (\"Proximate causation and intervening cause are\n\nusually issues for the jury to resolve.\").\n\n          Indeed, defendants state in their briefs that they would\n\n\"tend to agree\" that evidence of Solitro's failure to take cover\n\nwould be relevant if Diaz, and not Cornel, had been shot by the\n\npolice after Diaz brandished a weapon.       Here, of course, when\n\nSolitro left cover, he knew that Diaz was a threat but had not seen\n\nCornel yet.   Still, an armed confrontation had commenced, and the\n\nissue of whether Solitro's leaving cover was causally related to\n\nthe shooting of Cornel was appropriately left, as the district\n\njudge did, to the jury.     There was no abuse of discretion in\n\nadmitting the evidence.    The Solitro verdict in phase one will\n\nstand.\n\n          To the extent that the defendants make an argument that\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to support a jury verdict that\n\nSolitro violated Cornel's constitutional rights by using excessive\n\n\n                               -36-\n\fforce against him, the challenge fails.              The test for whether the\n\nuse   of   deadly   force     is   excessive    is   whether   an   objectively\n\nreasonable officer would believe that the suspect posed a \"threat\n\nof serious physical harm either to the officer or others.\" Garner,\n\n471   U.S.   at   12;   see   also   Abraham,    183    F.3d   at   289.    Most\n\nimportantly, there was evidence presented at the phase one trial\n\nthat Cornel was identifying himself as a police officer, was\n\nholding his gun with two hands as a police officer would, and was\n\nimmediately recognized by bystanders as an off-duty officer.                  We\n\nthink that a jury could find that an objectively reasonable officer\n\nwould have recognized Cornel as an officer, and thus would have\n\nrecognized that he was not a threat and would not have shot him.\n\nThere was also evidence that Cornel's gun was pointed downwards,\n\nand not at Diaz or anyone else, and that the officers shot him\n\nextraordinarily quickly, almost immediately after he left the\n\nrestaurant, and without giving him adequate warning.\n\n2. Plaintiff's Challenge to the Saraiva Verdict of No\n   Constitutional Violation -- Pro Hac Vice Revocation\n\n             Young argues that the Saraiva verdict should be vacated\n\nbecause two members of her legal team, including lead counsel\n\nScheck, were removed in the middle of the phase one trial.                 In the\n\ncompanion case Scheck v. City of Providence, No. 04-1334, issued\n\nthis same day, we held that the revocation of the pro hac vice\n\nstatus of Young's counsel was improper and reversed, reinstating\n\nthe pro hac vice status of the two lawyers.\n\n                                      -37-\n\f           Young argues initially that reversal of the Saraiva\n\nverdict should be automatic, and no prejudice need be demonstrated.\n\nThe    Supreme   Court   has   never   decided    whether   erroneous\n\ndisqualification of chosen counsel in either criminal or civil\n\ncases automatically results in reversal of a judgment in that case,\n\nor whether harmless error analysis is employed.

See Kevlik, 724 F.2d at 848-49.15\n\nIn this case, Young has not been deprived of any constitutional\n\nright through the district judge's disqualification of some of her\n\nlegal team.

We think it rare,\nalthough perhaps possible, that a denial of a civil party's chosen\ncounsel could rise to the level of a Fifth Amendment violation.\nCertainly there was no such violation here.\n\n                                     -39-\n\fdistrict judge to be very competent. The local rules required Mann\n\n-- as local counsel -- to be deeply involved in all proceedings in\n\nthe case conducted by pro hac vice counsel.     See D.R.I. Local R.\n\n5(c)(2).   Mann was offered a continuance by the district court and\n\nhe in fact took such a continuance.    By virtue of the continuance,\n\nthe judge's desire to give Mann \"leeway,\" and for other reasons,\n\nthere was a break of one week between the removal and the bulk of\n\nthe additional testimony.16   Mann noted that he had never tried a\n\nMonell case; however, he is a highly skilled trial lawyer and he\n\nwas not trying the Monell portion of the case in phase one, but\n\nonly a relatively straightforward § 1983 excessive force case.\n\n           Moreover, the removal occurred towards the very end of\n\nplaintiff's case in chief.     As to the defense case, Mann had\n\nparticipated extensively in the depositions of defendants' fact\n\nwitnesses at the scene. Defendants' case was quite short (a little\n\nmore than two days of testimony) and consisted almost entirely of\n\nsuch fact witnesses.   Finally, we stress that Young was partially\n\nsuccessful -- the jury found that Solitro had violated Cornel's\n\nconstitutional rights -- and there were important differences\n\n\n\n     16\n      Dr. Fyfe, however, testified the day after the removal. One\nof the key claims of prejudice made by the plaintiff was that Mann\nwas unprepared to proceed with examining Fyfe and unfamiliar with\nthe substance of his testimony. But the district judge did offer\nto allow Mann a continuance to prepare his examination. Plaintiffs\ndeclined that continuance because of Fyfe's limited availability.\nFurther, Fyfe's testimony focused mainly on Solitro; Solitro, of\ncourse, was found to have violated Cornel's constitutional rights.\n\n                                -40-\n\fbetween the actions of Solitro and Saraiva (who was found not to\n\nhave violated Cornel's rights), as Young herself points out in her\n\nreply brief to this court.          Solitro left cover; Diaz's testimony\n\nabout the officers' erratic behavior was directed primarily at\n\nSolitro's actions; and Solitro was closer to Cornel than Saraiva\n\nand had an unobstructed view of him because he had no cover.\n\n              The Saraiva verdict, like the Solitro verdict, is\n\nupheld.\n\n                                      IV.\n\nA.

Id. at 691-95.   Instead, it\n\nis   only    when    the   governmental     employees'    \"execution     of   a\n\ngovernment's policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury\" and is the\n\n\"moving     force\"   behind   the    constitutional      violation     that   a\n\nmunicipality can be liable.17        Id. at 694.\n\n\n     17\n      We quickly dispose of a preliminary argument. Defendants\nRyan and Cohen argue that Young's voluntary dismissal of Solitro\nand Saraiva as defendants, with prejudice, acts as a judgment that\nSolitro and Saraiva did not violate Cornel's constitutional rights,\nand this in turn bars liability against Providence or the\nsupervisors, since such liability can only be premised on an\nunderlying constitutional violation by Solitro and Saraiva. This\nis without merit.      Young's claim against the municipal and\nsupervisory defendants is not an attempt to adjudicate Solitro and\n\n                                     -41-\n\f            Assessing liability against the City requires two basic\n\nelements:    first,   that   plaintiff's   harm   was   caused   by     a\n\nconstitutional violation, and second, that the City be responsible\n\nfor that violation, an element which has its own components.\n\nCollins v.

The question at issue here\n\nis whether Providence is responsible for that violation.              The\n\nfinding that Solitro violated Cornel's constitutional rights is\n\nnecessary for any finding that the City is liable, see City of Los\n\n\n\nSaraiva's own rights or obtain a judgment binding on them.

While the voluntary\ndismissal surely had claim preclusive effect and barred any attempt\nto re-litigate the same claim against Solitro and Saraiva, see\nUnited States v.

The\n\nactions taken by Solitro that constituted excessive force must\n\nsomehow have been caused -- at least in part -- by the City's\n\nfailure to train, or erroneous hiring of, Solitro.               Since Saraiva\n\ndid not use excessive force against Cornel, any claim hinged on the\n\nCity's failure to train or discipline Saraiva must fail.              For that\n\nreason, the district court correctly granted summary judgment for\n\nthe City on the claim of inadequate discipline -- there is no\n\nallegation that Solitro was inadequately disciplined by Providence\n\nat any point before the shooting of Cornel.\n\n           The Supreme Court, concerned that municipal liability\n\nbased on fault by the City might collapse into de facto respondeat\n\nsuperior, has set a very high bar for assessing municipal liability\n\nunder   Monell.

Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112209\"><a href=\"/opinion/112209/canton-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989), that an allegation of a local government's failure\n\nto   train    police      officers      who     then    violate     a   plaintiff's\n\nconstitutional rights can be actionable where \"the failure to train\n\namounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with\n\nwhom the police come into contact\" and where \"the identified\n\ndeficiency in a city's training program [is] closely related to the\n\nultimate injury.\"        Id. at 388, 391.\n\n             At   the    outset,   we    agree    with     the   district     court's\n\nreasoning that any proper allegation of failure to train must be\n\naimed at Solitro's lack of training and not at the deficiencies in\n\nSaraiva's or Cornel's training, and must allege that Solitro's lack\n\nof training caused him to take actions that were objectively\n\nunreasonable and constituted excessive force on the night he shot\n\nCornel.      Such a theory, when the evidence is looked at most\n\nfavorably to the plaintiff, can be made out in this case: a jury\n\ncould find that Solitro's shooting of Cornel was unreasonable,\n\n\n                                        -44-\n\finter alia, because he should have recognized Cornel as an off-duty\n\nofficer (due to Cornel's demeanor and verbal commands) or not shot\n\nCornel so rapidly without making sure of his identity.                          A jury\n\ncould find that Solitro made such mistakes because of the PPD's\n\nlack    of       training   on     on-duty/off-duty      interactions,      avoiding\n\nmisidentifications of off-duty officers, and other issues relating\n\nto the City's always armed/always on-duty policy.                     Further, a jury\n\ncould find that this training deficiency constituted deliberate\n\nindifference to Cornel's rights.\n\n                 We reject one argument Young has used to advance the\n\nresult we do reach.           The district court is correct in saying that\n\nthe issue is not whether Cornel's death was caused by his own lack\n\nof     proper      training      in    identifying     himself   or    otherwise      in\n\nconducting himself while off-duty.19                See Young, 301 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n182.    Collins establishes that a city worker has no constitutional\n\nright       at   all   to   adequate       training;    thus,    there    can    be   no\n\nindependent         claim     of      constitutional    violation     separate     from\n\nSolitro's use of excessive force.                  See Collins, 503 U.S. at 130.\n\nWhile the objective reasonableness test for excessive force is not\n\nblind to the actions of the victim, the victim's actions are\n\n\n       19\n      This does not necessarily mean that evidence of Cornel's and\nSaraiva's lack of training is irrelevant; such evidence might be\nrelevant to show that Solitro's lack of training was part of a\npolicy of not training on on-duty/off-duty interactions, rather\nthan simply an \"otherwise sound program [that] has occasionally\nbeen negligently administered.\"    Canton, 489 U.S. at 391.     We\nexpress no view on this question.\n\n                                            -45-\n\finvariably considered from the officer's perspective and taken as\n\ngiven; the question is whether the officer's responses to the\n\nactions of the victim were objectively reasonable.       The jury,\n\nemploying this view, has found Solitro's actions unconstitutional.\n\n             We do, though, disagree with the district court's\n\nconclusion that, based on Melaragno's and Boehm's testimony, no\n\njury could find that the training program given to officers under\n\nthe policy for identification of off-duty officers was deliberately\n\nindifferent to the constitutional rights of off-duty officers like\n\nCornel. It is true that a training program must be quite deficient\n\nin order for the deliberate indifference standard to be met: the\n\nfact that training is imperfect or not in the precise form a\n\nplaintiff would prefer is insufficient to make such a showing.

The testimony of Melaragno\n\nand Boehm may be self-serving: they may be trying to protect the\n\n\n                               -46-\n\fdepartment or personally avoid blame for deficient training.       That\n\nalone does not make it untrue.      What calls the testimony into\n\nquestion is that the described training was not documented and the\n\ntestimony of other witnesses is in conflict with the testimony of\n\nMelaragno and Boehm.    Young presented evidence that the general\n\npolicy of the PPD was to document training, and yet for unclear\n\nreasons any on-duty/off-duty training was evidently undocumented.\n\nFurther, Ryan stated that he would know of any \"substantial\" off-\n\nduty training that Melaragno supervised.        This testimony either\n\nacts to contextualize the extent of the training described by\n\nMelaragno and Boehm as a proportion of total training or creates a\n\nflat conflict with the statements of Melaragno and Boehm.          Some\n\nofficers recalled little or no training on on-duty/off-duty issues.\n\nSolitro   recalled   Range   2000   training,    but   Melaragno    and\n\nCommissioner Partington were uncertain about the extent to which\n\nRange 2000 actually dealt with off-duty issues. Finally, Boehm and\n\nMelaragno themselves disagree about some of the training at issue.\n\nIn short, there are substantial unresolved issues of fact with\n\nrespect to the amount of training that the PPD actually gave to\n\nofficers, including Solitro, on avoiding misidentifications of off-\n\nduty officers.    The jury could find that there was, at best, very\n\nminimal training on these issues, and no real program of training\n\non them at all.\n\n\n\n\n                                -47-\n\f               A finding of deliberate indifference requires also that\n\nthe City have disregarded a known or obvious risk of serious harm\n\nfrom its failure to develop a training program that dealt with off-\n\nduty identifications in the context of its always armed/always on-\n\nduty policy.             We think the jury could reasonably make such a\n\nfinding here.             Such knowledge can be imputed to a municipality\n\nthrough a pattern of prior constitutional violations.                                   See Brown,\n\n520 U.S. at 407-08; see also Swain v.

Young does not rely\n\nprimarily on this sort of notice, although she does have some\n\nevidence from which a jury could find that it was common knowledge\n\nwithin       the    PPD    that       misidentifications               of       off-duty    officers\n\nresponding          to     an       incident      often      occurred             in   Providence,\n\nparticularly misidentification of minority officers.

We think a jury could find deliberate indifference by\n\nvirtue of this route here.\n\n            Although there was no evidence of a prior friendly fire\n\nshooting, a jury could find from the testimony of Commissioner\n\nPartington, Melaragno, and Boehm that the department knew that\n\nthere was a high risk that absent particularized training on\n\navoiding off-duty misidentifications, and given the department's\n\nalways armed/always on-duty policy, friendly fire shootings were\n\nlikely to occur.      A jury could conclude that the severity of the\n\nconsequences of a friendly fire shooting forced the department to\n\ntake notice of the high risk despite the rarity of such an\n\nincident.     Dr. Fyfe's report could lead the jury to conclude that\n\nit was common knowledge within the police community that the risk\n\n\n                                    -49-\n\fof friendly fire shootings with an always armed/always on-duty\n\npolicy was substantial, and it was also common knowledge that\n\nparticularized     training   on    on-duty/off-duty       interactions   (and\n\nparticularly on the risk of misidentifications) was required to\n\nlessen this risk.20 Beyond Dr. Fyfe, the statements of Commissioner\n\nPartington and Ryan could support a view that the City knew its\n\ntraining program to be seriously deficient.            We think, in short,\n\nthat the jury could find that the department knew that a friendly\n\nfire    shooting   in   violation    of     the   Fourth   Amendment    was    a\n\npredictable consequence of the PPD's failure to train on on-\n\nduty/off-duty interactions, and therefore that the department was\n\ndeliberately indifferent to Cornel's constitutional rights.\n\n            Defendants finally argue causation as a basis to affirm\n\nsummary judgment on the training claim in their favor.                        The\n\ncausation issue is close. The Supreme Court has stated that courts\n\nmust be very careful in assessing causation and must apply a\n\nstringent standard: \"the identified deficiency in a city's training\n\nprogram must be closely related to the ultimate injury.\"               Canton,\n\n489 U.S. at 391; see Brown, 520 U.S. at 409-410.                  As we have\n\nstated, the verdict in phase one reflects that Solitro acted in an\n\n\n\n       20\n      The district court declined to consider the Fyfe report on\nsummary judgment both because it was unsworn and because it was\nconclusory. See Young, 301 F. Supp. 2d at 177. The report was\nsworn to with an affidavit, and thus that ground for disregarding\nthe report was error. The aspects of the report on which we rely\ncould properly have been testified to by Fyfe.\n\n                                     -50-\n\fobjectively unreasonable fashion for an officer.    The jury could\n\nconclude that Solitro was not trained by the PPD to know that there\n\ncould be off-duty officers at a scene, responding to the same\n\nincidents, whom on-duty officers must take pains to identify.    A\n\njury could find that training would have made a difference here,\n\nunlike in other situations where it would have been unlikely to\n\nstop unconstitutional conduct. See, e.g., Barney v. Pulsipher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754311\"><a href=\"/opinion/754311/susan-barney-kathy-christensen-v-gerald-r-pulsipher-individually-and-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1308 (10th Cir. 1998) (training claim failed because\n\ntraining would be unlikely to stop jailer from sexually assaulting\n\ninmates); Robles, 113 F.3d at 736.\n\n          The testimony of Commissioner Partington and Melarango\n\nestablishes that even though identification of off-duty officers\n\nmight appear to be a matter of common sense, in situations of high\n\nstress such as where an officer is evaluating the threat level of\n\nan unknown individual armed with a gun, officers tend to fall back\n\non their training.

A jury could further find\nthat this policy poses substantial risks of harm which are inherent\nbut which risks could be minimized by proper training.       A jury\ncould also conclude from the testimony of Commissioner Partington\nthat there was a Providence policy or custom of not training PPD\nofficers on the inherent risks of the always armed/always on-duty\npolicy (and how to avoid them) in a way that was deliberately\nindifferent and caused the violation of Cornel's constitutional\nrights. And although it is unclear whether Chief Prignano was a\nfinal policymaker for the municipality on PPD training issues,\nCommissioner Partington clearly was such a final policymaker: as\nCommissioner of Public Safety he had been delegated broad\npolicymaking authority over PPD procedures by the municipality.\n     We again leave for another day the question left open in\nBaron, which is whether a court in a Monell case involving an\nallegation of a culpable \"custom\" -- not policy -- must explicitly\nlink that custom to a final policymaker in order to make a\nmunicipality liable.

But    \"even   when    an   applicant's   background\n\n\n                                  -53-\n\fcontains    complaints   of   physical     violence,   including   acts   of\n\naggression and assault,\" this may still be insufficient to make a\n\nCity liable for inadequate screening of an officer who then uses\n\nexcessive force.     See Morris, 299 F.3d at 924; see also Brown, 520\n\nU.S.   at   413-14   (officer's    record    insufficiently   related     to\n\nexcessive force complaint even where it included a conviction for\n\nassault and battery).\n\n            At any rate, we need not decide this issue on which the\n\nCity so heavily relies.       Although Brown itself is focused on the\n\n\"actual background of the individual applicant,\" it cannot be that\n\nthe \"thoroughness or adequacy of the municipality's review of the\n\napplication\" is irrelevant.       See Barney, 143 F.3d at 1308 n.7. The\n\nprocedures involved in the review of Solitro's application, on the\n\nundisputed facts, were not sufficiently inadequate to raise a jury\n\nquestion as to Providence's deliberate indifference.          A background\n\ncheck was performed, the background investigator spoke to two of\n\nSolitro's supervisors at the juvenile facility and received good\n\nreviews, and the Small incident came to light and was discussed at\n\nSolitro's oral interview before the hiring board.         That procedures\n\nwere flawed does not make Providence deliberately indifferent to\n\nthe risk that Solitro would use excessive force.\n\n            Finally, Young attempts to remove her hiring claim from\n\nthe ambit of the \"single incident\" facts discussed in Brown by\n\nstating that here, the PPD's hiring procedures were generally\n\n\n                                    -54-\n\fdeficient.    She points to evidence that background investigators\n\nwere untrained, that background checks were not received by the\n\nmembers of the oral board, and that background checks were ignored\n\nby the policymakers.    She also points to evidence of one violent\n\nindividual whose name kept coming up on the applicant list due to\n\ncorruption, but who was never actually hired.            Given the logic of\n\nBrown, this is not the sort of hiring pattern that could lead to an\n\ninference of deliberate indifference.22         See Synder v. Trepagnier,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754065\"><a href=\"/opinion/754065/james-snyder-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-sidney-trepagnier-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 796 (5th Cir. 1998) (analyzing hiring claim as a\n\nsingle incident case under Brown despite allegation that \"the\n\nCity's    hiring   policies     were     [generally]    deficient   because\n\ncandidates'   backgrounds     were     inadequately    investigated.\").   A\n\npattern of previous bad hiring decisions leading to constitutional\n\nviolations (perhaps of the same type as the one at issue) would\n\nlikely be necessary to get one outside the \"single incident\"\n\nanalysis in Brown.

The recent trend of Supreme Court cases,\n\nwhich use very particularized notions of causation and fault, make\n\n\n     22\n      We note, as well, that many of the general deficiencies in\nhiring procedures that Young points to have no causal relationship\nto the hiring of Solitro, and they thus have no causal relationship\nto the shooting of Cornel. It made no difference to Solitro that\nbackground checks were not seen by the oral board, for the\nbackground check on Solitro contained no disqualifying information.\nLikewise, the fact that negative background checks were ignored has\nno causal relationship to Solitro's hiring, again because his\nbackground check did not uncover any problems.\n\n                                     -55-\n\fit unlikely that the training claim and the hiring claim could be\n\ncombined into one mishmash, despite the hiring claim's inability to\n\nsurvive on its own, and given to the jury.               See, e.g., Brown, 520\n\nU.S. at 406-07.       Even if, in some cases, it might be appropriate to\n\ncombine the two claims, see Bordanaro v. McLeod, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520992\"><a href=\"/opinion/520992/rose-bordanaro-v-john-mcleod-appeal-of-city-of-everett-edward-connolly/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1159 (1st      Cir.    1989)    (combining     Monell   claims   that   city   had\n\ninadequate \"recruitment, training, supervision and discipline\" of\n\nits police force), this is not such a case.                      Throughout the\n\nproceedings below and here (save for a brief mention at oral\n\nargument), Young has argued the training, hiring, and discipline\n\npoints separately.\n\nB. Supervisory Liability and Qualified Immunity\n\n            Young asserts claims against Prignano, Sullivan, Ryan,\n\nand Cohen for supervisory liability.               See, e.g., Camilo-Robles v.\n\nHoyos,   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756655\"><a href=\"/opinion/756655/grancid-camilo-robles-v-dr-guillermo-hoyos-and-dr-hector-o/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span>    <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>    <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,     6-7   (1st   Cir.   1998);   Maldonado-Denis     v.\n\nCastillo-Rodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195359\"><a href=\"/opinion/195359/denis-v-rodriquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 581-82 (1st Cir. 1994).                   These\n\nindividual defendants ask that the summary judgment granted in\n\ntheir favor be affirmed.             We decline to do so.        The issues are\n\nbetter addressed by the district court.\n\n               We have reversed entry of summary judgment against\n\nProvidence on the failure to train claim, a consideration pertinent\n\nto qualified immunity analysis.              The district court never dealt\n\nwith qualified immunity issues -- it made no rulings on the second\n\nprong of qualified immunity analysis, whether both the underlying\n\n\n                                        -56-\n\fconstitutional violation of Solitro and the basis for liability of\n\nthe various supervisors were clearly established, nor did it make\n\nany rulings on the third prong, whether the supervisors' actions\n\nwere otherwise objectively reasonable.23   See Camilo-Robles, 151\n\nF.3d at 6-8.   Further, the record on qualified immunity issues is\n\nnot well developed and the briefing on appeal is inadequate. Thus,\n\nthe most prudent course is to vacate the grant of summary judgment\n\nin favor of the four supervisory defendants, premised on the\n\nerroneous grant of summary judgment to Providence, and remand.   We\n\ndo not address the issue of supervisory liability here.\n\n                                V.\n\n          The phase one verdict that Solitro violated Cornel's\n\nconstitutional rights while Saraiva did not is affirmed.   On phase\n\ntwo, the grant of summary judgment in Providence's favor on Young's\n\n§ 1983 failure to train claim based on the training of Solitro is\n\nreversed, and that claim is remanded for trial.     The grants of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Providence on all other § 1983 claims\n\nagainst it -- based on Saraiva and Cornel's training, Solitro's\n\nhiring, and Saraiva's discipline -- are affirmed.    The grants of\n\n     23\n      In its May 30, 2003 ruling on Sullivan and Prignano's initial\nmotion for summary judgment, the district court held that the two,\nin their motion, never raised any qualified immunity issues that\nwent beyond the merits of the case; in its February 11, 2004 ruling\non Ryan, Cohen, and Providence's subsequent motion for summary\njudgment, the district court did not reach qualified immunity\nbecause it held that the disposition of the claims against\nProvidence effectively disposed of the supervisory claims -- on the\nmerits -- as well. Young, 301 F. Supp. 2d at 183-84.\n\n                               -57-\n\fsummary judgment against Young on the § 1983 supervisory claims\n\nagainst    Prignano,    Sullivan,   Ryan,   and   Cohen   are    vacated   and\n\nremanded    to   the   district   court.    The   case    is    remanded   for\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.24\n\n\n\n\n     24\n      Young challenges various discovery orders made by the\ndistrict court refusing requests for (1) records concerning\nmisidentification of officers by civilians or other officers, (2)\narrest and incident reports reflecting PPD officers taking off-duty\naction, (3) discipline records concerning off-duty conduct of PPD\nofficers, and (4) data and statistics on racial profiling. We see\nno abuse of discretion in the denial of these discovery requests.\nThe third and fourth items are irrelevant given Young's legal\ntheory.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).        While some of the\ninformation in the first and second items could have relevance to\nthis case, the sweeping breadth in the way these requests were\nframed adequately justified denial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2).\nYoung also challenges orders declining a request to make former\nProvidence Mayor Cianci give more specific answers to deposition\nquestions and declining to force the current PPD chief to be\ndeposed at all.    There was no abuse of discretion here either;\nneither witness is relevant to Young's case.\n     Young also challenges a denial of her motion to amend the\ncomplaint to add a supervisory claim against Ryan for his\ninvolvement in the hiring process. This challenge is moot, given\nthat we have affirmed summary judgment against Young on her claim\nthat Providence was liable for deficient hiring; Young has put\nforth no separate theory that would lead to supervisory liability\nagainst Ryan based on hiring.\n     Young never asks us to rule on whether the district court's\nuse of a local rule, D.R.I. Am. Gen. Order 2002-01, to limit the\ntotal length of legal memoranda to 10 pages for most motions and 20\npages for motions for summary judgment, and to limit the length of\nsupporting appendices and exhibits submitted with those memoranda\nby use of the same (10 and 20) page restrictions, was appropriate.\nWe do not reach this question.\n\n                                    -58-\n\f</pre>",
