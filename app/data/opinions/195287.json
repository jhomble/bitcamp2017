In addition,  defendant  challenges his\n\nsentence  on  the ground  that  the  district court's  upward\n\ndeparture  from the  Sentencing Guidelines  was unreasonable.\n\nWe affirm defendant's conviction, but vacate his sentence and\n\nremand the case for resentencing.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          Defendant is a former  elementary school teacher at\n\nAntilles Elementary School, located at  Fort Buchanan, Puerto\n\nRico.  The school is administered by the United States Navy. \n\n                    \n\n1.  Section 2244(a)(1) provides in pertinent part:\n\n          Whoever,  in  the  special  maritime  and\n          territorial  jurisdiction  of the  United\n          States  .  . .  knowingly  engages  in or\n          causes sexual contact  with or by another\n          person, if to  do so would violate .  . .\n          (1)  section 2241  of the  title had  the\n          sexual contact  been a sexual  act, shall\n          be fined under this title, imprisoned not\n          more than ten years, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C.   2244(a)(1).   Section 2241(c) makes it  a federal\ncrime to engage, or attempt to engage, in a sexual act with a\nperson  under   the  age   of  twelve,  in   the  territorial\njurisdiction        of        the       United        States.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nComplaints of inappropriate touching led  to an investigation\n\nof defendant,  which resulted  in an indictment  charging him\n\nwith  six counts  of abusive  sexual contact  involving three\n\nminor  victims.2   The  charges arose  from allegations  that\n\ndefendant had touched, kissed and rubbed against three of his\n\nformer students.\n\n          Each  victim was  a  student of  defendant for  one\n\nschool year, and all  three testified that numerous incidents\n\nof sexual contact occurred throughout their time in the third\n\ngrade.  The government also presented the expert testimony of\n\nDr. Nancy Slicner, a  child psychologist, who testified about\n\nthe general  behavioral characteristics exhibited  by victims\n\nof child sexual abuse.\n\n          The jury  found defendant  guilty as charged.   The\n\ntrial judge sentenced defendant to 120 months imprisonment on\n\neach count,  with the  sentences to  run concurrently.   This\n\nappeal ensued.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.  Expert Testimony\n                    \n\n          Defendant  first  argues  that the  district  court\n\nerroneously admitted  the expert testimony of  Dr. Slicner, a\n\nchild psychologist  who testified  for the government.   More\n\n                    \n\n2.  Although defendant was originally  charged in a six count\nindictment,  two counts  were  voluntarily dismissed  by  the\ngovernment prior to trial.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nprecisely, defendant argues that the  expert testimony should\n\nhave  been  excluded  because  it  improperly  bolstered  the\n\ntestimony of  the minor victims, and  therefore its probative\n\nvalue was outweighed  by its prejudicial  effect.  At  trial,\n\nhowever, no  objection was made  to the admissibility  of Dr.\n\nSlicner's testimony.   Therefore, any error  in the admission\n\nof the evidence  was not  preserved for appeal.   See  United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Castro-Lara, 970  F.2d 976,  980 (1st  Cir. 1992),\n                      \n\ncert.  denied,  113  S.

Geer, 923 F.2d 892,  896 (1st Cir.  1991) (quoting United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.  Young, 470 U.S.  1, 15 (1985)  (internal quotation\n                \n\nmarks and  citation omitted));  see United States  v. Olivio-\n                                                             \n\nInfante,  938 F.2d 1406,  1411 (1st Cir.  1991) (under \"plain\n       \n\nerror\" review  we will  reverse only  where a  miscarriage of\n\njustice has occurred).\n\n          Defendant focuses  his  argument on  Dr.  Slicner's\n\ntestimony  that the way in which  the minor victims discussed\n\nthe incidents of  sexual abuse with  her was consistent  with\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nthe  manner generally  exhibited  by children  who have  been\n\nsexually  abused or  molested.   Dr.  Slicner explained  that\n\nchildren generally  \"tend to  be reluctant,  they tend  to be\n\nembarrassed,   uncomfortable,   ashamed  of   what  happened.\n\nThey're  very uncomfortable giving details.   I see  a lot of\n\nthat.  And I saw that in these children.\"\n\n          Defendant relies on the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n\nUnited  States v. Binder, 769 F.2d 595 (9th Cir. 1985), where\n                        \n\nthe court  held that the district  court erroneously admitted\n\nexpert testimony addressed directly to the credibility of the\n\nabused children.  The court found reversible error because,\n\n          \"[t]he testimony of the experts . . . was\n          not    limited     to    references    to\n          psychological literature or experience or\n          to  a discussion  of  a class  of victims\n          generally.  Rather the  experts testified\n          that  these  particular children  in this\n          particular case  could be believed.   The\n          jury  in  effect was  impermissibly being\n          asked to accept an expert's determination\n          that  these   particular  witnesses  were\n          truthful.\"\n\n United States v. Antone, 981 F.2d 1059, 1062 (9th Cir. 1992)\n                        \n\n(quoting Binder, 769 F.2d  at 602).  According to  the court,\n               \n\nthe  effect of  the experts'  testimony  was to  \"bolster the\n\nchildren's  story  and  to   usurp  the  jury's  fact-finding\n\nfunction.\"   Id.  In  Binder, however, the  court conducted a\n                            \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n\"harmless error\"  review, a standard far  less demanding than\n\nthat of \"plain error.\"3\n\n          Although  trial  judges  are  afforded  significant\n\nleeway in determining  whether otherwise admissible  evidence\n\nis unfairly prejudicial  under Fed. R. Evid.  403, see United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Spinosa, 982  F.2d 620, 628-29 (1st Cir.  1992), we\n                 \n\nhave  recognized that  \"proffered  expert  testimony  [c]ould\n\ncreate  a substantial danger of undue prejudice . . . because\n\nof its  aura  of special  reliability  and  trustworthiness.\"\n\nUnited  States v. Fosher, 590  F.2d 381, 383  (1st Cir. 1979)\n                        \n\n(collecting  cases);  accord United States v. Boney, 977 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n624, 631 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\n\n          We   agree  with   defendant  that   Dr.  Slicner's\n\ntestimony  sent an  implicit  message to  the  jury that  the\n\nchildren had testified  truthfully, and this might  therefore\n\nhave interfered with the jury's function as the sole assessor\n\nof  witness   credibility.    But,   even  assuming  (without\n\ndeciding) that the  district court improperly  calibrated its\n\nscales  in balancing  the probative  value of  this testimony\n\n                    \n\n3.  Were  we  reviewing  the  objectionable  portion  of  Dr.\nSlicner's  testimony for  harmless  error, we  would have  to\ndecide whether  \"it can be  said `with fair  assurance, after\npondering all that happened  without stripping the  erroneous\naction   from  the   whole,   that  the   judgment  was   not\nsubstantially swayed by the error.'\"  United States  v. Ladd,\n                                                            \n885 F.2d  954,  957 (1st  Cir.  1989) (quoting  Kotteakos  v.\n                                                         \nUnited States, 328 U.S. 750 (1946)).\n             \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nagainst  its  prejudice  to  defendant,4 any  error  was  not\n\n\"plain.\"\n\n          Our  conclusion is  based on  two factors.   First,\n\ndefendant offered the  testimony of its  own expert, a  child\n\npsychiatrist, who sought to  undermine the credibility of Dr.\n\nSlicner.   According  to defendant's  expert, the  interviews\n\nconducted  by Dr. Slicner of  the children were  too short to\n\nallow  Dr. Slicner to  assess their  stories accurately.   In\n\naddition, defendant's expert stated that the children's trial\n\ntestimony,  which  she  listened  to  attentively,  was   not\n\nconsistent with testimony that  one would expect from victims\n\nof child  abuse.  Second,  the district court  instructed the\n\njury as follows:\n\n               During  the  trial  you   heard  the\n          testimony .  . . of Dr. Nancy Slicner who\n          was  presented  by the  government .  . .\n          [a]nd we  also heard the testimony of Dr.\n          Martinez Lugo presented by  the defendant\n          . .  . .   If scientific or  technical or\n          other specialized  knowledge may assist[]\n          the juror in understand[ing] the evidence\n          or determining facts  in issue, a witness\n          qualified as an expert  . . . may testify\n          before  the jury  and  state  an  opinion\n          concerning  such  matters.    Now  merely\n                                                   \n          because an expert  witness has  expressed\n                                                   \n          an opinion does  not mean, however,  that\n                                                   \n          you as jurors must accept this opinion.\n                                                 \n\n                    \n\n4.  Under  prevailing  law, relevant  evidence,  such  as Dr.\nSlicner's testimony, is admissible unless its probative value\nis   \"substantially  outweighed\"  by   the  risk   of  unfair\nprejudice, confusion,  or waste of  time.   United States  v.\n                                                         \nArgencourt, 996 F.2d 1300, 1305 (1st Cir 1993); Fed. R. Evid.\n          \n403.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n               The  same as with any other witness.\n          It  is up  to you  to decide  whether you\n                                                   \n          believe  the testimony of  the expert and\n                                                   \n          choose to rely upon it.\n                                 \n\nTrial Transcript, Vol. XIV at pp. 864-65 (emphasis added).\n\n          Not  only  was  the  jury   presented  with  expert\n\ntestimony directly contradicting the  objectionable testimony\n\noffered by  Dr. Slicner, but, the  court expressly instructed\n\nthe jurors that they were free to reject the opinions offered\n\nby  the  experts.    Under  the  circumstances,  we  are  not\n\npersuaded that Dr. Slicner's  testimony was so prejudicial to\n\ndefendant \"as  to undermine  the fundamental fairness  of the\n\ntrial and contribute to a miscarriage of justice.\"  Geer, 923\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 897 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nB.  Improper Argument\n                     \n\n          Defendant   next  contends  that  comments  by  the\n\nprosecutor to the jury  during closing arguments deprived him\n\nof  a fair  trial.   According to  defendant, the  prosecutor\n\nimpermissibly vouched for the credibility of the government's\n\nwitnesses in his response  to defense counsel's argument that\n\nthe FBI had fabricated evidence.  The prosecutor stated:\n\n          Then  they  are also  implying  here, the\n          defense  is implying  that there  is some\n          kind  of conspiracy, that  the FBI wanted\n          to  fabricate a case against Mr. Rosales,\n          a school teacher  at Antilles  Elementary\n          School.    Like  the  FBI  would  have  a\n          special interest  in this  man.   But for\n          you  to believe  that story,  you [w]ould\n          also  have  to  believe  that  the United\n          States,  Mr. Pereira [the other AUSA] and\n          myself are part of that  conspiracy.  And\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n          that we would blend [sic] ourselves to do\n          something such as improper  and unethical\n          conduct.\n\nDefense counsel objected to this remark.  The court sustained\n\nthe objection, and warned the prosecutor that \"[t]he evidence\n\nhas  to do  with  the participation  of  the FBI  agents  [in\n\ngathering evidence],\"  and that he  should not go  beyond the\n\nevidence.    No curative  instruction  was  requested by  the\n\ndefense,  and none was  given.   Moreover, defendant  did not\n\nmove for a mistrial.\n\n          When a prosecutor places the credibility of counsel\n\nat issue, the advantage lies solidly with the government, and\n\nthus, prosecutors are  prohibited from doing so.

Because this is precisely\n\nwhat  the prosecutor in this case did, there is no doubt that\n\nhis  argument was  improper.   And,  the government  concedes\n\nthis.  Nevertheless, a new trial is not warranted.\n\n          The question  is whether the  prosecutor's argument\n\nwas sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a new trial under the\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\ncircumstances.     This  requires  that  we   engage  in  the\n\nfunctional  equivalent  of  the  familiar   \"harmless  error\"\n\nanalysis.   See United States  v. Brown, 938  F.2d 1482, 1489\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 112 S.

In\n       \n\ndetermining whether the prosecutor's remark was harmless, \"we\n\nconsider  a range of factors, starting with the nature of the\n\nprosecutor's (mis)conduct  and  ending with  the  unavoidable\n\nbottom  line:  whether  we deem it  likely, or  not, that any\n\nprejudice  affected the  outcome  of the  case.\"   Rodriguez-\n                                                             \n\nEstrada,  877 F.2d at 159.   In conducting  this analysis, we\n       \n\nevaluate  the prosecutor's  comments  in the  context of  the\n\ntrial as  a whole,  not  in isolation.    See id.;  see  also\n                                                             \n\nNickens, 955  F.2d at 121.   While we have no  doubt that the\n       \n\nprosecutor's  argument  was  wholly inappropriate,  which  is\n\nconceded  by  the  government  on  appeal,  reversal  is  not\n\nwarranted for the following reasons.\n\n          First,  the prosecutor did not repeatedly place his\n\ncredibility in issue, or extend his argument beyond the scope\n\nof  the evidence.  His improper statement was an isolated one\n\nand,  as such, was less  likely to impact  the outcome of the\n\ncase.  See Brown, 938 F.2d at 1489; Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n274.     Second,  the  issue   of  the  credibility   of  the\n\ngovernment's witnesses, particularly  the children, was fully\n\ndeveloped at  trial, and  the jury  was instructed that  they\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nalone  were  charged with  judging  the  credibility of  each\n\nwitness.   This diminishes  any likelihood that  the jury was\n\nswayed by the prosecutor's \"vouching.\"   See Cresta, 825 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat 556. \n\n          Next,   although  the  court   did  not  explicitly\n\ninstruct  the jury  to  disregard  the prosecutor's  improper\n\nremark,  it sustained  defendant's objection  and immediately\n\nwarned the  prosecutor  (in the  presence of  the jury)  that\n\ndefendant's allegations concerned misconduct only by the FBI,\n\nand that his argument should be limited to the evidence.\n\n          Finally, the trial court repeatedly  instructed the\n\njury as to the proper role of argument in the case.  Prior to\n\ncounsel's  opening statements, again before their summations,\n\nand once again in its charge, the court explained to the jury\n\nthat  the attorney's  arguments were  not evidence,  and that\n\nonly the  testimony of  the witnesses and  admitted documents\n\nwere  evidence.    See,  e.g.,   Brown,  938  F.2d  at   1489\n                                      \n\n(instruction that  arguments of counsel are  not evidence can\n\nremove prejudicial taint of improper argument); United States\n                                                             \n\nv. de Leon Davis, 914  F.2d 340, 345 (1st Cir. 1990)  (same).\n                \n\nAlthough there  are circumstances  where such  an instruction\n\nmay not be  sufficient given the  nature of the  prosecutor's\n\nargument, see Arrieta-Agressot v.  United States, 3 F.3d 525,\n                                                \n\n529 (1st  Cir. 1993)  (court's instruction that  arguments of\n\ncounsel are  not evidence not enough  to counteract prejudice\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nfrom emotionally charged summation  where \"the danger was not\n\nso much that the jury would consider the prosecutor's remarks\n\nto  be  `evidence.'     Rather,  the  threat   was  that  the\n\nprosecutor's remarks would excite the jury, invite a partisan\n\nresponse, and distract its attention  from [the merits of the\n\ncase].\"), such circumstances are not present here.\n\n          We  have  reviewed  the transcripts  of  the  trial\n\ntestimony  in this case, in  addition to the  briefs, and are\n\nconvinced  that the objectionable  remark, viewed in context,\n\nand in light of the court's instructions to the jury, did not\n\naffect  the outcome of  the trial.   Defendant's trial lasted\n\nfor  ten days, and each party  was afforded one hour in which\n\nto deliver its  summation.   It is highly  unlikely that  the\n\njury's  verdict could  have  been the  result  of this  brief\n\nremark by the prosecutor.   We conclude that the  verdict was\n\nbased  upon the  testimony, and  the jury's  belief  that the\n\ngovernment's witnesses were credible.\n\n          Defendant also argues that the prosecutor, in other\n\nportions  of   his  summation,  improperly  vouched  for  the\n\ncredibility of  government witnesses  and commented  on facts\n\nnot in evidence.  We have carefully reviewed the prosecutor's\n\nclosing argument and rebuttal, and find that these statements\n\nwere  not improper.   The  allegedly improper  statements are\n\nlittle  more than words and phrases taken out of context from\n\nthe prosecutor's  argument.    When  the  allegedly  improper\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nstatements  are  read in  full and  in  context, we  can find\n\nnothing  objectionable about them.

The Upward Departure\n                        \n\n          In   sentencing   defendant,  the   district  court\n\ncalculated  a Sentencing  Guidelines offense  level of  22 as\n\nfollows:  the \"abusive sexual contact\" base  offense level of\n\nten, U.S.S.G   2A3.4(a)(3);  plus six levels because none  of\n\nthe  victims  had   attained  the  age   of  twelve,  id.    \n                                                         \n\n2A3.4(b)(1); plus four levels as a multiple count adjustment,\n\nid.  3D1.4; plus two  levels based on defendant's abuse  of a\n   \n\nposition of trust in a manner that facilitated commission  of\n\nthe  offense, id.     3B1.3.    The  court  then  placed  the\n                 \n\ndefendant   into  Criminal   History   Category  I.     These\n\ncalculations produced a Guideline Sentence range of forty-one\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nto  fifty-one  months  imprisonment.

The  court then departed upward pursuant\n\nto      5K2.0  of  the   Sentencing  Guidelines,  effectively\n\nincreasing  defendant's offense  level to  31, and  imposed a\n\nprison  term of  120 months.5   Defendant  contends that  the\n\ndegree of the upward departure was unreasonable.  18 U.S.C.  \n\n3742(e)(3).\n\n          In United States v.

Id. at 947.  \n                              \n\n          At defendant's sentencing the district court found,\n\n          there  are  aggravating  factors in  this\n          case.  . .  .   [T]hat  defendant Rosales\n          repeatedly  engaged  in similar  criminal\n          behavior  as .  .  .  represented by  the\n          counts of the convictions with the minors\n          named  in  the  indictment,  conduct  for\n          which he was  not charged.

This was\n\nincorrect.    The correct  range is  108-135  months.   It is\n\nunclear whether  the court sentenced defendant  to 120 months\n\non each count because  (1) it meant to sentence  defendant at\n\nthe  low  end  of the  incorrect  range,  or  (2) because  it\n\nintended  to impose  the  statutory maximum  for each  count.\n\nThus, defendant  might very well have been  prejudiced by the\n\ncourt's failure to identify the guideline range the court had\n\nin  mind.   But,  because we  vacate defendant's  sentence on\n\nother grounds, see infra  pp. 15-18, we need not  pursue this\n                        \n\nline of thought.\n\n          We review a sentencing  court's decision to  depart\n\nby  examining  \"(1) whether  the reasons  the court  gave for\n\ndeparting  are the sort that  might permit a  departure in an\n\nappropriate case;  (2) whether the record  supports a finding\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nof facts demonstrating the existence of such reasons; and (3)\n\nwhether,  given the  reasons, the  degree of  departure [from\n\nabout  four years to ten]  is reasonable.\"   United States v.\n                                                          \n\nMendez-Colon, No. 93-1346, slip  op. at 3 (1st Cir.

Thus,\n\nwe review the  district court's determination that  a case is\n\nunusual,  and   therefore  warrants  departure,   \"with  full\n\nawareness of, and  respect for, the trier's superior feel for\n\nthe case.\"  United  States v.

On\n\nthe  other   hand,  \"where  departure  decisions   reflect  a\n\ndetermination of the purpose of,  or an interpretation of the\n\nlanguage in,  a guideline  or  statute,\"   plenary review  is\n\nappropriate.  Doe, slip op. at 5. In   the    present   case,\n                 \n\ndefendant argues  merely that, because  the indictment covers\n\nthe entire time period during which defendant's multiple acts\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nallegedly occurred, an upward  departure cannot be based upon\n\nthese  acts.  This contention  is without merit.   Under this\n\nindictment, defendant's  offense level would  remain the same\n\nregardless of whether he engaged in four or four hundred acts\n\nof  misconduct.     The  pivotal  question   is  whether  the\n\npersistent  and  repetitive  nature of  defendant's  conduct,\n\ncharged or uncharged, is an appropriate ground for departure.\n\nIn other words, is this case \"unusual\" relative to the garden\n\nvariety  sex   offender  case?    Here,   defendant  has  not\n\nchallenged the  district court's determination  that his case\n\nwas  outside of the  \"heartland,\" and therefore  worthy of an\n\nupward  departure.

The frequent and continuous nature\n\nof defendant's conduct is set out in the Pre-Sentence Report.\n\nBecause  no objection  was lodged  with respect to  the PSR's\n\ncontents, these facts could be accepted as true and accurate.\n\nSee United States v.

Although   sentencing  courts   have\n\nsubstantial  \"leeway\"  with  respect  to the  \"degree\"  of  a\n\ndeparture,  see Doe, slip op.  at 20-21, Rivera,  994 F.2d at\n                                               \n\n950, this  freedom does not  relieve a sentencing  court from\n\nexplaining its ultimate decision  of how far to depart.

The school is administered by the United States Navy.  Complaints of inappropriate touching led to an investigation of defendant, which resulted in an indictment charging him with six counts of abusive sexual contact involving three minor victims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The charges arose from allegations that defendant had touched, kissed and rubbed against three of his former students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each victim was a student of defendant for one school year, and all three testified that numerous incidents of sexual contact occurred throughout their time in the third grade.  The government also presented the expert testimony of Dr. Nancy Slicner, a child psychologist, who testified about the general behavioral characteristics exhibited by victims of child sexual abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found defendant guilty as charged.  The trial judge sentenced defendant to 120 months imprisonment on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Expert Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant first argues that the district court erroneously admitted the expert testimony of Dr. Slicner, a child psychologist who testified for the government.  More precisely, defendant argues that the expert testimony should have been excluded because it improperly bolstered the testimony of the minor victims, and therefore its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.  At trial, however, no objection was made to the admissibility of Dr. Slicner's testimony.  Therefore, any error in the admission of the evidence was not preserved for appeal.  See United States v. Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 980 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2935, 124 L.Ed.2d 684 (1993);  United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 10 n. 9 (1st Cir.1989);  see also Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1).  Our standard of review under the circumstances is \"plain error,\" see United States v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d 1446, 1453 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1346, 122 L.Ed.2d 728 (1993), and we will reverse only if the error \" 'seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of [the] judicial proceeding[ ].' \"  United States v. Geer, 923 F.2d 892, 896 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1046, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted));  see United States v. Olivio-Infante, 938 F.2d 1406, 1411 (1st Cir.1991) (under \"plain error\" review we will reverse only where a miscarriage of justice has occurred).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant focuses his argument on Dr. Slicner's testimony that the way in which the minor victims discussed the incidents of sexual abuse with her was consistent with the manner generally exhibited by children who have been sexually abused or molested.  Dr. Slicner explained that children generally \"tend to be reluctant, they tend to be embarrassed, uncomfortable, ashamed of what happened.  They're very uncomfortable giving details.  I see a lot of that.  And I saw that in these children.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant relies on the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States v. Binder, 769 F.2d 595 (9th Cir.1985), where the court held that the district court erroneously admitted expert testimony addressed directly to the credibility of the abused children.  The court found reversible error because,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>\"[t]he testimony of the experts ... was not limited to references to psychological literature or experience or to a discussion of a class of victims generally.  Rather the experts testified that these particular children in this particular case could be believed.  The jury in effect was impermissibly being asked to accept an expert's determination that these particular witnesses were truthful.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Antone, 981 F.2d 1059, 1062 (9th Cir.1992) (quoting Binder, 769 F.2d at 602).   According to the court, the effect of the experts' testimony was to \"bolster the children's story and to usurp the jury's fact-finding function.\"  Id.  In Binder, however, the court conducted a \"harmless error\" review, a standard far less demanding than that of \"plain error.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although trial judges are afforded significant leeway in determining whether otherwise admissible evidence is unfairly prejudicial under Fed.R.Evid. 403, see United States v. Spinosa, 982 F.2d 620, 628-29 (1st Cir.1992), we have recognized that \"proffered expert testimony [c]ould create a substantial danger of undue prejudice ... because of its aura of special reliability and trustworthiness.\"  United States v. Fosher, 590 F.2d 381, 383 (1st Cir.1979) (collecting cases);  accord United States v. Boney, 977 F.2d 624, 631 (D.C.Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with defendant that Dr. Slicner's testimony sent an implicit message to the jury that the children had testified truthfully, and this might therefore have interfered with the jury's function as the sole assessor of witness credibility.  But, even assuming (without deciding) that the district court improperly calibrated its scales in balancing the probative value of this testimony against its prejudice to defendant,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> any error was not \"plain.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is based on two factors.  First, defendant offered the testimony of its own expert, a child psychiatrist, who sought to undermine the credibility of Dr. Slicner.  According to defendant's expert, the interviews conducted by Dr. Slicner of the children were too short to allow Dr. Slicner to assess their stories accurately.  In addition, defendant's expert stated that the children's trial testimony, which she listened to attentively, was not consistent with testimony that one would expect from victims of child abuse.  Second, the district court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial you heard the testimony ... of Dr. Nancy Slicner who was presented by the government ... [a]nd we also heard the testimony of Dr. Martinez Lugo presented by the defendant....  If scientific or technical or other specialized knowledge may assist[ ] the juror in understand[ing] the evidence or determining facts in issue, a witness qualified as an expert ... may testify before the jury and state an opinion concerning such matters.  Now merely because an expert witness has expressed an opinion does not mean, however, that you as jurors must accept this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same as with any other witness.  It is up to you to decide whether you believe the testimony of the expert and choose to rely upon it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial Transcript, Vol.  XIV at pp. 864-65 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only was the jury presented with expert testimony directly contradicting the objectionable testimony offered by Dr. Slicner, but, the court expressly instructed the jurors that they were free to reject the opinions offered by the experts.  Under the circumstances, we are not persuaded that Dr. Slicner's testimony was so prejudicial to defendant \"as to undermine the fundamental fairness of the trial and contribute to a miscarriage of justice.\"  Geer, 923 F.2d at 897 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Improper Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant next contends that comments by the prosecutor to the jury during closing arguments deprived him of a fair trial.  According to defendant, the prosecutor impermissibly vouched for the credibility of the government's witnesses in his response to defense counsel's argument that the FBI had fabricated evidence.  The prosecutor stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>Then they are also implying here, the defense is implying that there is some kind of conspiracy, that the FBI wanted to fabricate a case against Mr. Rosales, a school teacher at Antilles Elementary School.  Like the FBI would have a special interest in this man.  But for you to believe that story, you [w]ould also have to believe that the United States, Mr. Pereira [the other AUSA] and myself are part of that conspiracy.  And that we would blend [sic] ourselves to do something such as improper and unethical conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel objected to this remark.  The court sustained the objection, and warned the prosecutor that \"[t]he evidence has to do with the participation of the FBI agents [in gathering evidence],\" and that he should not go beyond the evidence.  No curative instruction was requested by the defense, and none was given.  Moreover, defendant did not move for a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a prosecutor places the credibility of counsel at issue, the advantage lies solidly with the government, and thus, prosecutors are prohibited from doing so.  See United States v. Cresta, 825 F.2d 538, 555 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1042, 108 S.Ct. 2033, 100 L.Ed.2d 618 (1988);  see also United States v. Nickens, 955 F.2d 112, 121 (1st Cir.)  (prosecutor may not express personal assurances about conclusions to be drawn from the evidence), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 108, 121 L.Ed.2d 66 (1992);  United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 158 (1st Cir.1989) (same);  United States v. Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d 268, 273 (1st Cir.1987) (same).  Because this is precisely what the prosecutor in this case did, there is no doubt that his argument was improper.  And, the government concedes this.  Nevertheless, a new trial is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is whether the prosecutor's argument was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a new trial under the circumstances.  This requires that we engage in the functional equivalent of the familiar \"harmless error\" analysis.  See United States v. Brown, 938 F.2d 1482, 1489 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 611, 116 L.Ed.2d 633 (1991);  Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d at 159;  Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).  In determining whether the prosecutor's remark was harmless, \"we consider a range of factors, starting with the nature of the prosecutor's (mis)conduct and ending with the unavoidable bottom line:  whether we deem it likely, or not, that any prejudice affected the outcome of the case.\"  Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d at 159.   In conducting this analysis, we evaluate the prosecutor's comments in the context of the trial as a whole, not in isolation.   See id.;   see also Nickens, 955 F.2d at 121.   While we have no doubt that the prosecutor's argument was wholly inappropriate, which is conceded by the government on appeal, reversal is not warranted for the following reasons:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the prosecutor did not repeatedly place his credibility in issue, or extend his argument beyond the scope of the evidence.  His improper statement was an isolated one and, as such, was less likely to impact the outcome of the case.  See Brown, 938 F.2d at 1489;  Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d at 274.   Second, the issue of the credibility of the government's witnesses, particularly the children, was fully developed at trial, and the jury was instructed that they alone were charged with judging the credibility of each witness.  This diminishes any likelihood that the jury was swayed by the prosecutor's \"vouching.\"   See Cresta, 825 F.2d at 556.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, although the court did not explicitly instruct the jury to disregard the prosecutor's improper remark, it sustained defendant's objection and immediately warned the prosecutor (in the presence of the jury) that defendant's allegations concerned misconduct only by the FBI, and that his argument should be limited to the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury as to the proper role of argument in the case.  Prior to counsel's opening statements, again before their summations, and once again in its charge, the court explained to the jury that the attorney's arguments were not evidence, and that only the testimony of the witnesses and admitted documents were evidence.  See, e.g., Brown, 938 F.2d at 1489 (instruction that arguments of counsel are not evidence can remove prejudicial taint of improper argument);  United States v. de Leon Davis, 914 F.2d 340, 345 (1st Cir.1990) (same).  Although there are circumstances where such an instruction may not be sufficient given the nature of the prosecutor's argument, see Arrieta-Agressot v. United States, 3 F.3d 525, 529 (1st Cir.1993) (court's instruction that arguments of counsel are not evidence not enough to counteract prejudice from emotionally charged summation where \"the danger was not so much that the jury would consider the prosecutor's remarks to be 'evidence.'   Rather, the threat was that the prosecutor's remarks would excite the jury, invite a partisan response, and distract its attention from [the merits of the case].\"), such circumstances are not present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have reviewed the transcripts of the trial testimony in this case, in addition to the briefs, and are convinced that the objectionable remark, viewed in context, and in light of the court's instructions to the jury, did not affect the outcome of the trial.  Defendant's trial lasted for ten days, and each party was afforded one hour in which to deliver its summation.  It is highly unlikely that the jury's verdict could have been the result of this brief remark by the prosecutor.  We conclude that the verdict was based upon the testimony, and the jury's belief that the government's witnesses were credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also argues that the prosecutor, in other portions of his summation, improperly vouched for the credibility of government witnesses and commented on facts not in evidence.  We have carefully reviewed the prosecutor's closing argument and rebuttal, and find that these statements were not improper.  The allegedly improper statements are little more than words and phrases taken out of context from the prosecutor's argument.  When the allegedly improper statements are read in full and in context, we can find nothing objectionable about them.  Furthermore, because no contemporaneous objection was made, our review is only for plain error.  Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 528;   United States v. Smith, 982 F.2d 681, 682 (1st Cir.1993);   Nickens, 955 F.2d at 121.   Under the \"plain error\" standard, we could not order a new trial based on these remarks.   See United States v. Soto-Alvarez, 958 F.2d 473, 477 (1st Cir.)  (improper argument constitutes plain error only if it \" 'undermine[s] the fundamental fairness of the trial and contribute[s] to a miscarriage of justice.' \"  (quoting United States v. Soto-Alvarez, 876 F.2d 209, 233 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1030, 110 S.Ct. 742, 107 L.Ed.2d 760 (1990))), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 221, 121 L.Ed.2d 159 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Upward Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sentencing defendant, the district court calculated a Sentencing Guidelines offense level of 22 as follows:  the \"abusive sexual contact\" base offense level of ten, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2A3.4(a)(3);  plus six levels because none of the victims had attained the age of twelve, id. Sec. 2A3.4(b)(1);  plus four levels as a multiple count adjustment, id. Sec. 3D1.4;  plus two levels based on defendant's abuse of a position of trust in a manner that facilitated commission of the offense, id. Sec. 3B1.3.  The court then placed the defendant into Criminal History Category I.  These calculations produced a Guideline Sentence range of forty-one to fifty-one months imprisonment.  Id. ch. 5, part A (Sentencing Table).  The court then departed upward pursuant to Sec. 5K2.0 of the Sentencing Guidelines, effectively increasing defendant's offense level to 31, and imposed a prison term of 120 months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Defendant contends that the degree of the upward departure was unreasonable.  18 U.S.C.

The evidence at trial showed that defendant engaged in uncharged incidents of abusive sexual contact with minor RG on five occasions, with minor MQ on several occasions and minor VT almost on a daily basis during one school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that, \"based on multiplicity of incidents of abusive sexual contact that the defendant Roberto Rosales engaged [in] with minors named in the indictment, the Court departs to an offense level of thirty-one.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court went on to state that the Guidelines range for offense level thirty-one, where the defendant had a criminal history rating of I, was 120-135 months.  This was incorrect.  The correct range is 108-135 months.  It is unclear whether the court sentenced defendant to 120 months on each count because (1) it meant to sentence defendant at the low end of the incorrect range, or (2) because it intended to impose the statutory maximum for each count.  Thus, defendant might very well have been prejudiced by the court's failure to identify the guideline range the court had in mind.  But, because we vacate defendant's sentence on other grounds, see infra pp. 769-70, we need not pursue this line of thought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a sentencing court's decision to depart by examining \"(1) whether the reasons the court gave for departing are the sort that might permit a departure in an appropriate case;  (2) whether the record supports a finding of facts demonstrating the existence of such reasons;  and (3) whether, given the reasons, the degree of departure [from about four years to ten] is reasonable.\"  United States v. Mendez-Colon, 15 F.3d 188, 189 (1st Cir.1994);  see United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 862, 110 S.Ct. 177, 107 L.Ed.2d 133 (1989);  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 950.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the first prong of our analysis, we have recognized that \"[s]ome district court decisions that a particular case is unusual enough to warrant departure reflect sentencing experience of a sort one typically finds in district, not appellate, courts.\"  United States v. Doe, 18 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir.1994).  Thus, we review the district court's determination that a case is unusual, and therefore warrants departure, \"with full awareness of, and respect for, the trier's superior feel for the case.\"  United States v. Legarda, 17 F.3d 496, 501 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting Rivera, 994 F.2d at 952 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).  On the other hand, \"where departure decisions reflect a determination of the purpose of, or an interpretation of the language in, a guideline or statute,\" plenary review is appropriate.  Doe, 18 F.3d at 43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, defendant argues merely that, because the indictment covers the entire time period during which defendant's multiple acts allegedly occurred, an upward departure cannot be based upon these acts.  This contention is without merit.  Under this indictment, defendant's offense level would remain the same regardless of whether he engaged in four or four hundred acts of misconduct.  The pivotal question is whether the persistent and repetitive nature of defendant's conduct, charged or uncharged, is an appropriate ground for departure.  In other words, is this case \"unusual\" relative to the garden variety sex offender case?   Here, defendant has not challenged the district court's determination that his case was outside of the \"heartland,\" and therefore worthy of an upward departure.  Given the respect that we extend to a sentencing court's determination as to whether a given circumstance makes a case \"unusual,\" see Doe, 18 F.3d at 43;  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 952, we do not believe that the district court erred in its decision to depart from the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the second part of our review, the record provides an ample basis for the district court's conclusion that defendant engaged in multiple acts of misconduct over a prolonged period of time.  The frequent and continuous nature of defendant's conduct is set out in the Pre-Sentence Report.  Because no objection was lodged with respect to the PSR's contents, these facts could be accepted as true and accurate.  See United States v. Ramirez, 11 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Citro, 938 F.2d 1431, 1445 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 902, 116 L.Ed.2d 804 (1992) and --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1997, 118 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992).  Thus, the district court's finding of circumstances supporting a departure was not clearly erroneous.  See United States v. Mendez-Colon, 15 F.3d 188, 190 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we must determine whether the extent of the court's upward departure was reasonable.  See Doe, 18 F.3d at 47-48;  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e)(3) (length of sentence imposed must be reviewed for its \"reasonableness\").  In examining the reasonableness of a departure, we must consider, inter alia, \"the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence, as stated by the district court....\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e)(3)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the district court articulated the grounds for its upward departure, and then departed upward by nine offense levels, without explaining its choice of this particular figure.  Although sentencing courts have substantial \"leeway\" with respect to the \"degree\" of a departure, see Doe, 18 F.3d at 48;  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 950, this freedom does not relieve a sentencing court from explaining its ultimate decision of how far to depart.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(c)(2) (sentencing court must state \"specific reason[s]\" for imposing a \"particular sentence\" outside of the guideline range);  United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 336 (1st Cir.1990) (Generally, a sentencing judge must articulate not only his or her reason for departing ... but must also offer a rationale for the degree of departure.);   see also United States v. Kelly, 1 F.3d 1137, 1144 (10th Cir.1993) (\"a district court must specifically articulate reasons for the degree of departure.  Merely explaining why a departure was made does not fulfill the separate requirement of stating the reasons for imposing the particular sentence.\"  (citations and internal quotations omitted)).  Absent such an explanation, we cannot assess the reasonableness of the court's nine-level upward departure.  Accordingly, defendant's sentence is vacated, and we remand the case for resentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 2244(a)(1) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States ... knowingly engages in or causes sexual contact with or by another person, if to do so would violate ...

We affirm defendant's conviction, but vacate his sentence and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant is a former elementary school teacher at Antilles Elementary School, located at Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico.  The school is administered by the United States Navy.  Complaints of inappropriate touching led to an investigation of defendant, which resulted in an indictment charging him with six counts of abusive sexual contact involving three minor victims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The charges arose from allegations that defendant had touched, kissed and rubbed against three of his former students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each victim was a student of defendant for one school year, and all three testified that numerous incidents of sexual contact occurred throughout their time in the third grade.  The government also presented the expert testimony of Dr. Nancy Slicner, a child psychologist, who testified about the general behavioral characteristics exhibited by victims of child sexual abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found defendant guilty as charged.  The trial judge sentenced defendant to 120 months imprisonment on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Expert Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant first argues that the district court erroneously admitted the expert testimony of Dr. Slicner, a child psychologist who testified for the government.  More precisely, defendant argues that the expert testimony should have been excluded because it improperly bolstered the testimony of the minor victims, and therefore its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.  At trial, however, no objection was made to the admissibility of Dr. Slicner's testimony.  Therefore, any error in the admission of the evidence was not preserved for appeal.  See United States v.

But, even assuming (without deciding) that the district court improperly calibrated its scales in balancing the probative value of this testimony against its prejudice to defendant,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> any error was not \"plain.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is based on two factors.  First, defendant offered the testimony of its own expert, a child psychiatrist, who sought to undermine the credibility of Dr. Slicner.  According to defendant's expert, the interviews conducted by Dr. Slicner of the children were too short to allow Dr. Slicner to assess their stories accurately.  In addition, defendant's expert stated that the children's trial testimony, which she listened to attentively, was not consistent with testimony that one would expect from victims of child abuse.  Second, the district court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial you heard the testimony ... of Dr. Nancy Slicner who was presented by the government ...

If scientific or technical or other specialized knowledge may assist[ ] the juror in understand[ing] the evidence or determining facts in issue, a witness qualified as an expert ... may testify before the jury and state an opinion concerning such matters.  Now merely because an expert witness has expressed an opinion does not mean, however, that you as jurors must accept this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same as with any other witness.

Under the circumstances, we are not persuaded that Dr. Slicner's testimony was so prejudicial to defendant \"as to undermine the fundamental fairness of the trial and contribute to a miscarriage of justice.\"  Geer, 923 F.2d at 897 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Improper Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant next contends that comments by the prosecutor to the jury during closing arguments deprived him of a fair trial.  According to defendant, the prosecutor impermissibly vouched for the credibility of the government's witnesses in his response to defense counsel's argument that the FBI had fabricated evidence.  The prosecutor stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>Then they are also implying here, the defense is implying that there is some kind of conspiracy, that the FBI wanted to fabricate a case against Mr. Rosales, a school teacher at Antilles Elementary School.  Like the FBI would have a special interest in this man.  But for you to believe that story, you [w]ould also have to believe that the United States, Mr. Pereira [the other AUSA] and myself are part of that conspiracy.  And that we would blend [sic] ourselves to do something such as improper and unethical conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel objected to this remark.  The court sustained the objection, and warned the prosecutor that \"[t]he evidence has to do with the participation of the FBI agents [in gathering evidence],\" and that he should not go beyond the evidence.  No curative instruction was requested by the defense, and none was given.  Moreover, defendant did not move for a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a prosecutor places the credibility of counsel at issue, the advantage lies solidly with the government, and thus, prosecutors are prohibited from doing so.

Because this is precisely what the prosecutor in this case did, there is no doubt that his argument was improper.  And, the government concedes this.  Nevertheless, a new trial is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is whether the prosecutor's argument was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a new trial under the circumstances.  This requires that we engage in the functional equivalent of the familiar \"harmless error\" analysis.  See United States v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564957\"><a href=\"/opinion/564957/united-states-v-kenneth-michael-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1482</span></a></span>, 1489 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></span> (1991);  Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d at 159;  Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).  In determining whether the prosecutor's remark was harmless, \"we consider a range of factors, starting with the nature of the prosecutor's (mis)conduct and ending with the unavoidable bottom line:  whether we deem it likely, or not, that any prejudice affected the outcome of the case.\"  Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d at 159.   In conducting this analysis, we evaluate the prosecutor's comments in the context of the trial as a whole, not in isolation.   See id.;   see also Nickens, 955 F.2d at 121.   While we have no doubt that the prosecutor's argument was wholly inappropriate, which is conceded by the government on appeal, reversal is not warranted for the following reasons:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the prosecutor did not repeatedly place his credibility in issue, or extend his argument beyond the scope of the evidence.  His improper statement was an isolated one and, as such, was less likely to impact the outcome of the case.  See Brown, 938 F.2d at 1489;  Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d at 274.   Second, the issue of the credibility of the government's witnesses, particularly the children, was fully developed at trial, and the jury was instructed that they alone were charged with judging the credibility of each witness.  This diminishes any likelihood that the jury was swayed by the prosecutor's \"vouching.\"   See Cresta, 825 F.2d at 556.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, although the court did not explicitly instruct the jury to disregard the prosecutor's improper remark, it sustained defendant's objection and immediately warned the prosecutor (in the presence of the jury) that defendant's allegations concerned misconduct only by the FBI, and that his argument should be limited to the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury as to the proper role of argument in the case.  Prior to counsel's opening statements, again before their summations, and once again in its charge, the court explained to the jury that the attorney's arguments were not evidence, and that only the testimony of the witnesses and admitted documents were evidence.  See, e.g., Brown, 938 F.2d at 1489 (instruction that arguments of counsel are not evidence can remove prejudicial taint of improper argument);  United States v. de Leon Davis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548347\"><a href=\"/opinion/548347/united-states-v-alvaro-david-de-leon-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span>, 345 (1st Cir.1990) (same).  Although there are circumstances where such an instruction may not be sufficient given the nature of the prosecutor's argument, see Arrieta-Agressot v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628961\"><a href=\"/opinion/628961/juan-arrieta-agressot-regulo-rios-jose-antonio-barroso-adalberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 529 (1st Cir.1993) (court's instruction that arguments of counsel are not evidence not enough to counteract prejudice from emotionally charged summation where \"the danger was not so much that the jury would consider the prosecutor's remarks to be 'evidence.'   Rather, the threat was that the prosecutor's remarks would excite the jury, invite a partisan response, and distract its attention from [the merits of the case].\"), such circumstances are not present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have reviewed the transcripts of the trial testimony in this case, in addition to the briefs, and are convinced that the objectionable remark, viewed in context, and in light of the court's instructions to the jury, did not affect the outcome of the trial.  Defendant's trial lasted for ten days, and each party was afforded one hour in which to deliver its summation.  It is highly unlikely that the jury's verdict could have been the result of this brief remark by the prosecutor.  We conclude that the verdict was based upon the testimony, and the jury's belief that the government's witnesses were credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also argues that the prosecutor, in other portions of his summation, improperly vouched for the credibility of government witnesses and commented on facts not in evidence.  We have carefully reviewed the prosecutor's closing argument and rebuttal, and find that these statements were not improper.  The allegedly improper statements are little more than words and phrases taken out of context from the prosecutor's argument.  When the allegedly improper statements are read in full and in context, we can find nothing objectionable about them.  Furthermore, because no contemporaneous objection was made, our review is only for plain error.  Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 528;   United States v.

The Upward Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sentencing defendant, the district court calculated a Sentencing Guidelines offense level of 22 as follows:  the \"abusive sexual contact\" base offense level of ten, U.S.S.G. Sec. 2A3.4(a)(3);  plus six levels because none of the victims had attained the age of twelve, id. Sec. 2A3.4(b)(1);  plus four levels as a multiple count adjustment, id. Sec. 3D1.4;  plus two levels based on defendant's abuse of a position of trust in a manner that facilitated commission of the offense, id. Sec. 3B1.3.  The court then placed the defendant into Criminal History Category I.  These calculations produced a Guideline Sentence range of forty-one to fifty-one months imprisonment.  Id. ch. 5, part A (Sentencing Table).  The court then departed upward pursuant to Sec. 5K2.0 of the Sentencing Guidelines, effectively increasing defendant's offense level to 31, and imposed a prison term of 120 months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Defendant contends that the degree of the upward departure was unreasonable.  18 U.S.C.

[T]hat defendant Rosales repeatedly engaged in similar criminal behavior as ... represented by the counts of the convictions with the minors named in the indictment, conduct for which he was not charged.  The evidence at trial showed that defendant engaged in uncharged incidents of abusive sexual contact with minor RG on five occasions, with minor MQ on several occasions and minor VT almost on a daily basis during one school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that, \"based on multiplicity of incidents of abusive sexual contact that the defendant Roberto Rosales engaged [in] with minors named in the indictment, the Court departs to an offense level of thirty-one.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court went on to state that the Guidelines range for offense level thirty-one, where the defendant had a criminal history rating of I, was 120-135 months.  This was incorrect.  The correct range is 108-135 months.  It is unclear whether the court sentenced defendant to 120 months on each count because (1) it meant to sentence defendant at the low end of the incorrect range, or (2) because it intended to impose the statutory maximum for each count.  Thus, defendant might very well have been prejudiced by the court's failure to identify the guideline range the court had in mind.  But, because we vacate defendant's sentence on other grounds, see infra pp. 769-70, we need not pursue this line of thought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a sentencing court's decision to depart by examining \"(1) whether the reasons the court gave for departing are the sort that might permit a departure in an appropriate case;  (2) whether the record supports a finding of facts demonstrating the existence of such reasons;  and (3) whether, given the reasons, the degree of departure [from about four years to ten] is reasonable.\"  United States v.

Doe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195243\"><a href=\"/opinion/195243/united-states-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.1994).  Thus, we review the district court's determination that a case is unusual, and therefore warrants departure, \"with full awareness of, and respect for, the trier's superior feel for the case.\"  United States v.

On the other hand, \"where departure decisions reflect a determination of the purpose of, or an interpretation of the language in, a guideline or statute,\" plenary review is appropriate.

This contention is without merit.  Under this indictment, defendant's offense level would remain the same regardless of whether he engaged in four or four hundred acts of misconduct.  The pivotal question is whether the persistent and repetitive nature of defendant's conduct, charged or uncharged, is an appropriate ground for departure.  In other words, is this case \"unusual\" relative to the garden variety sex offender case?   Here, defendant has not challenged the district court's determination that his case was outside of the \"heartland,\" and therefore worthy of an upward departure.  Given the respect that we extend to a sentencing court's determination as to whether a given circumstance makes a case \"unusual,\" see Doe, 18 F.3d at 43;  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 952, we do not believe that the district court erred in its decision to depart from the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the second part of our review, the record provides an ample basis for the district court's conclusion that defendant engaged in multiple acts of misconduct over a prolonged period of time.  The frequent and continuous nature of defendant's conduct is set out in the Pre-Sentence Report.  Because no objection was lodged with respect to the PSR's contents, these facts could be accepted as true and accurate.  See United States v.

See Doe, 18 F.3d at 47-48;  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e)(3) (length of sentence imposed must be reviewed for its \"reasonableness\").  In examining the reasonableness of a departure, we must consider, inter alia, \"the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence, as stated by the district court....\"  18 U.S.C.

Although sentencing courts have substantial \"leeway\" with respect to the \"degree\" of a departure, see Doe, 18 F.3d at 48;  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 950, this freedom does not relieve a sentencing court from explaining its ultimate decision of how far to depart.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(c)(2) (sentencing court must state \"specific reason[s]\" for imposing a \"particular sentence\" outside of the guideline range);  United States v.

Merely explaining why a departure was made does not fulfill the separate requirement of stating the reasons for imposing the particular sentence.\"  (citations and internal quotations omitted)).  Absent such an explanation, we cannot assess the reasonableness of the court's nine-level upward departure.
