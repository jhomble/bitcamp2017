Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                       Lipez, Circuit Judge, and\n                    Garcia-Gregory,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Charles W. Rankin, with whom Rankin & Sultan was on brief, for\nappellant.\n     Kathleen A. Felton, Attorney, U.S. Department of Justice, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, U.S. Attorney, and George W. Vien and\nMichael D. Ricciuti, Assistant U.S. Attorneys, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                             June 8, 2004\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.            This case raises two issues:\n\nwhether   this   Hobbs   Act    prosecution     was   within   the   scope   of\n\nCongress's    power   under    the   Commerce   Clause,    and   whether     the\n\ndefendant's sentence was in error in light of his acquittal on one\n\ncount.\n\n             Seeking to extort money from James Carter, a former drug\n\ndealer, James McCormack helped plan and execute Carter's kidnapping\n\nand ransom.      After violently abducting Carter from his home,\n\nMcCormack and his fellow kidnappers threatened to kill and torture\n\nhim unless they were paid a million dollars.            When Carter pleaded\n\nthat he only possessed about $300,000 in mutual funds and other\n\nnon-liquid assets, the kidnappers agreed to release him and told\n\nhim to liquidate his mutual funds in small increments until he\n\ncould pay them $100,000.\n\n             McCormack was eventually apprehended and convicted by a\n\njury of both attempting and conspiring to violate the Hobbs Act, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1951(a).     He was acquitted of using and carrying a firearm\n\nin relation to a crime of violence, id. § 924(c).          He was sentenced\n\nto serve 188 months in prison.\n\n           McCormack argues that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the Hobbs Act convictions because no rational jury could\n\nhave found that his actions would have at least a de minimis effect\n\non interstate commerce.        We reject this claim.      In doing so, we do\n\nnot adopt the government's test that a particular amount of money\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f(here $100,000) is per se sufficient to meet the commerce element\n\nof a Hobbs Act offense.        McCormack also argues that his sentence is\n\nplainly erroneous because it is longer than it would have been had\n\nthe jury convicted, rather than acquitted, him of the firearm\n\noffense.         This sentencing argument has a common-sense appeal,\n\nespecially to anyone not familiar with the specialized world of the\n\nfederal sentencing guidelines.         But in this case, McCormack cannot\n\nshow plain error because he cannot bear his burden of demonstrating\n\nthat   he   was     harmed.    Consequently,    we    affirm    his   188-month\n\nsentence.\n\n                                       I.\n\n             The facts are described, for purposes of McCormack's\n\nsufficiency of the evidence challenge, as a reasonable jury could\n\nhave found them, in the light most favorable to the verdict.\n\nUnited States v. Casas, 356 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             Sometime in 1997, James McCormack was approached by his\n\nfriend and fellow Charlestown, Massachusetts resident, James Dagle,\n\nand asked about his willingness to participate in the possible\n\nrobbery     or    kidnapping   of   James   Carter.    Dagle,     a   long-time\n\ncriminal, explained to McCormack that he had learned from his\n\nattorney, Fred Ford, that Carter had accumulated large sums of\n\nmoney in the early 1980s from selling marijuana.               Although Carter\n\nwas eventually convicted and served eighteen months in prison in\n\nthe late 1980s, he was fined only $15,000, and his assets were not\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fforfeited. Dagle told McCormack that robbing or kidnapping Carter,\n\nwho had recently moved back to the Boston area and was self-\n\nemployed    in   the   real   estate    business,     could   be   potentially\n\nlucrative, and that Ford wanted to gauge McCormack's interest in\n\nparticipating in such a scheme.\n\n            McCormack, who independently knew that Carter had made a\n\nlot of money by selling drugs in the 1980s, told Dagle he was\n\ninterested.      Thereafter, Ford, Dagle and McCormack met several\n\ntimes to determine how they could find where Carter was living.\n\nEventually, Ford learned that Carter was living with his family in\n\nCarlisle,     Massachusetts.      Ford1      passed   this    information    to\n\nMcCormack and Dagle, who arranged to obtain Carter's address from\n\nrecords in the Carlisle Town Hall.\n\n            McCormack and Dagle started watching Carter's house to\n\nsee if there was an opportunity to break in while nobody was home.\n\nAfter ten or fifteen multiple-hour surveillance missions, the pair\n\ndetermined that Carter's house was rarely, if ever, empty.                  They\n\ntold Ford that they did not believe that burglary of Carter's house\n\nwas a feasible option, and Ford urged them to pursue the kidnapping\n\nplan.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Attorney Ford was eventually convicted of attempting to hire\nan undercover agent to kill McCormack and Dagle because he feared\nthat they would cooperate with authorities against him in\nconnection with the Carter kidnapping.\n\n                                       -4-\n\f           In early 1998, McCormack organized a meeting with Dagle\n\nand two other acquaintances he had recruited, Phil Myers and\n\nRichard Hegarty, to discuss kidnapping Carter.        McCormack proposed\n\nthat the group wait outside of Carter's house and abduct him from\n\nhis driveway immediately after he returned home from dropping off\n\nhis two children at school.      McCormack was familiar with Carter's\n\nschedule as a result of his surveillance activities.            The group\n\nalso   discussed   who   would   obtain   the   necessary   equipment   for\n\nconducting the kidnapping, and Dagle was put in charge of procuring\n\nseveral handguns.\n\n           Less than an hour after the meeting ended, Dagle met with\n\nMcCormack and provided him with the promised guns, but told him\n\nthat he no longer wanted to participate in the kidnapping.              With\n\nthe help of Myers, McCormack replaced Dagle with Dennis Quirk. The\n\nreconstituted group, which included McCormack, Myers, Hegarty, and\n\nQuirk, met several more times to finalize the details of the plan.\n\nOn about April 10, 1998, Hegarty and Myers stole two cars and a van\n\nfor use in the kidnapping, which was planned to take place a week\n\nlater.\n\n           On the morning of April 17, 1998, the four conspirators\n\nmet at a designated location in Somerville, Massachusetts.              They\n\nwere joined by a fifth person, Francis Lang, whom Hegarty and Quirk\n\nhad recruited.     McCormack put the guns that Dagle had supplied in\n\nthe stolen car, along with handcuffs, gloves and hats.           At least\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fQuirk and Lang were given guns.        McCormack, accompanied by Myers,\n\nthen drove the stolen van up to Carter's house and waited in a\n\nsmall bend part-way up Carter's long driveway.             The other three\n\ndrove the stolen car to the school that one of Carter's children\n\nattended.     When they saw Carter returning from dropping off his\n\nchild at the school, they radioed McCormack and Myers and then\n\nfollowed Carter home.\n\n            When Carter pulled into his driveway, his path forward\n\nwas blocked by the van; once Carter stopped his car, he was boxed-\n\nin from behind by the car driven by Hegarty.          Myers and Quirk, who\n\nwere wearing stockings over their heads and vests that read \"FBI,\"\n\napproached Carter's SUV, and Myers told Carter that he was under\n\narrest.     Carter attempted to escape by ramming his SUV into the\n\nvan; in response, Quirk fired his gun into the front of Carter's\n\nvehicle.    Myers then pulled Carter out of the window of the jeep\n\nusing a choke hold and dragged him into the van, where he was\n\nhandcuffed, blindfolded, and bound with duct tape. In the process,\n\nLang, who had gotten into the van, hit Carter in the face with the\n\nbutt of a gun and broke several of his front teeth.\n\n            McCormack, who was driving the van, sped off once Carter\n\nwas inside.     Followed by Quirk, who was driving Carter's SUV, and\n\nHegarty, who was still in the stolen car, McCormack drove the van\n\nto Charlestown.     During the drive, Myers and Quirk threatened to\n\nkill   Carter   unless   he   paid   them   a   million   dollars.   Carter\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fexplained that he did not have that much money, but said that he\n\ndid own about $300,000 in mutual funds.\n\n          After picking up Quirk, who had ditched Carter's SUV when\n\nit ran out of gas, McCormack drove the van to a warehouse in\n\nCharlestown.     There, the kidnappers transferred the bound and\n\nblindfolded    Carter   into   a   laundry    cart,   which    McCormack     had\n\narranged beforehand, and wheeled him inside the warehouse.                   The\n\nkidnappers took shifts interrogating Carter about how much money he\n\nhad and where he kept it.      Throughout, they hit Carter, poked him\n\nwith knives, and threatened to torture him and cut off parts of his\n\nbody. Carter pleaded that while he was once a marijuana dealer, he\n\nno longer dealt drugs; he had invested most of the money he made\n\nwhile dealing drugs in real estate, mutual funds, and stocks.\n\n          Eventually,     McCormack    told    Carter   that    he   would    be\n\nreleased so that he could sell his mutual funds and turn over\n\n$100,000 to the kidnappers. Carter was instructed to liquidate his\n\nmutual funds slowly, in increments under $10,000, and was told that\n\nsomebody named \"Sam\" would call him with follow-up instructions.\n\nIf he refused to pay the money or contacted the police, Carter was\n\ntold that both he and his family would be killed.              Keeping Carter\n\nbound and blindfolded, the kidnappers then removed his bloodied\n\nclothing, dressed him in new clothing, and dropped him off at the\n\nside of a road in Woburn, Massachusetts.          Carter eventually found\n\nhis way to a telephone and contacted his family.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f             The following day, after Carter spoke with his attorney,\n\nhe reported the kidnapping to the Carlisle police.              He also had\n\nextensive dental work done on his broken front teeth and learned\n\nthat he had suffered a small stroke during the ordeal.           As a result\n\nof the stroke, Carter suffers from several permanent disabilities:\n\nhe   slurs   his   speech,   has   a    slight   limp,   and   has    problems\n\nmaintaining his balance.\n\n             Several days after Carter reported the kidnapping to the\n\npolice, his SUV, which had a bullet hole in its fender, was\n\nrecovered. Carter also received several messages from \"Sam\" on his\n\nanswering machine; the voice was McCormack's. But it was not until\n\nMyers was arrested in September of 1998 on an unrelated matter that\n\nthe police learned who was behind Carter's abduction.                Myers led\n\nofficers to Dagle, who agreed to cooperate with authorities. Dagle\n\nrecorded several conversations with McCormack in which the two\n\ndiscussed the Carter kidnapping and whether they would be caught by\n\nthe police.\n\n             On December 21, 2000, a superseding indictment was filed\n\nin the District of Massachusetts that charged McCormack, inter\n\nalia, with conspiring and attempting to obstruct commerce by\n\nrobbery and extortion, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) (Hobbs Act), and with\n\nusing and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fviolence, id. § 924(c).2      After a five-day trial in which both\n\nDagle and Myers testified and McCormack's incriminating recorded\n\nstatements were presented to the jury, McCormack was convicted on\n\nthe Hobbs Act counts, but acquitted of the firearm charge.        On\n\nNovember 5, 2002, the district court sentenced McCormack to 188\n\nmonths of imprisonment.\n\n                                   II.\n\nA.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            Because McCormack moved under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29 for a\n\njudgment of acquittal at the close of evidence, he has fully\n\npreserved his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. United\n\nStates v. Van Horn, 277 F.3d 48, 54 (1st Cir. 2002).   Our review is\n\nde novo.    United States v. Cornier-Ortiz, 361 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir.\n\n2004). The issue is whether a rational factfinder, considering all\n\nof the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, could\n\nhave found beyond a reasonable doubt that Carter's kidnapping \"in\n\nany way or degree obstruct[ed], delay[ed] or affect[ed] commerce,\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).    See United States v. Boulerice, 325 F.3d 75,\n\n79 (1st Cir. 2003) (standard of review for denials of Rule 29\n\nmotions).\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The indictment also charged McCormack with conspiracy and\nattempt to possess with the intent to distribute five kilograms or\nmore of cocaine. These counts were dismissed before trial and are\nnot at issue here.\n\n                                   -9-\n\f              The commerce element of a § 1951(a) offense extends to\n\nthe limit of Congress's Commerce Clause authority.                           Stirone v.\n\nUnited States, 361 U.S. 212, 215 (1960); United States v. Capozzi,\n\n347 F.3d 327, 335 (1st Cir. 2003).                   It reaches all conduct that\n\ncreates   a    \"realistic     probability         of    a    de    minimis    effect     on\n\ninterstate commerce.\"             Capozzi, 347 F.3d at 335 (quoting United\n\nStates v. Butt, 955 F.3d 77, 80 n.2 (1st Cir. 1992)).                        Under this\n\nstandard, it is the purpose of the conspiracy, rather than the\n\nresult the conspirators achieve, that is relevant in determining\n\nthe impact on commerce.            United States v. Nguyen, 246 F.3d 52, 54\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).      Importantly, the de minimis test under the Hobbs\n\nAct remains applicable after the Supreme Court's Commerce Clause\n\ndecisions in United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), and\n\nUnited States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000).                         See Capozzi, 347\n\nF.3d at 335-36.\n\n              The government contends that the kidnappers' extortionate\n\ndemand of $100,000, standing alone, is sufficient to satisfy the\n\nHobbs Act's commerce element under the de minimis effects test. It\n\nargues that any reasonable factfinder would conclude that, in order\n\nto satisfy such an exorbitant demand, the victim would need to\n\nliquidate assets in a manner affecting interstate commerce.\n\n              We   decline    to       adopt   any     bright-line        rule   that    an\n\nextortionate       demand    of    a    certain   sum       from   an    individual     can\n\nautomatically satisfy the commerce element of the Hobbs Act.\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fDetermining whether an act has a reasonable probability of having\n\na \"de minimis effect\" on interstate commerce inherently requires a\n\nmultifaceted and case-specific inquiry.       See United States v.\n\nCarcione, 272 F.3d 1297, 1301 n.6 (11th Cir. 2001) (\"[W]e have\n\nrepeatedly held that in determining whether there is a minimal\n\neffect on commerce, each case must be decided on its own facts.\"\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).      Moreover, it is far from\n\nclear that, as the government asserts, a $100,000 demand would\n\nnecessarily require transactions affecting interstate commerce    in\n\nevery case: many people would simply have no way of gathering\n\n$100,000 together, whereas those specifically targeted because of\n\ntheir access to money may well be able to satisfy such a demand\n\nwithout resort to large financial transactions affecting interstate\n\ncommerce.     Finally, the government's proposed standard does not\n\nadequately distinguish between the extortion or robbery of a\n\nbusiness and that of an individual.\n\n            McCormack, ably represented, seizes on this last point to\n\nargue that the evidence is too attenuated here because the victim\n\nwas an individual rather than a business or institution and was\n\ntargeted because he was believed to have cash on hand.            He\n\ncorrectly points out that the victim's connection to a business\n\nentity is an important, though not dispositive, consideration in\n\ndetermining whether the commerce element of a Hobbs Act violation\n\ncan be met.     Cf. United States v. Perrotta, 313 F.3d 33, 36 (2d\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fCir.   2002)    (there   is   a   significant   distinction   between   \"the\n\nextortion of an individual and the extortion of a business for the\n\npurposes   of    establishing     Hobbs   Act   jurisdiction\").    Because\n\ncriminal acts that are directed at individuals rather than at\n\nbusinesses normally have a less substantial effect on interstate\n\ncommerce, courts have often required a heightened showing of an\n\neffect on commerce to sustain such Hobbs Act convictions. See id.;\n\nUnited States v. Lynch, 282 F.3d 1049, 1054 (9th Cir. 2002); United\n\nStates v. Wang, 222 F.3d 234, 238-40 (6th Cir. 2000); United States\n\nv. Quigley, 53 F.3d 909, 910-11 (8th Cir. 1995).\n\n           The evidence here satisfies this heightened standard.           A\n\nreasonable jury could have concluded that there was a \"realistic\n\nprobability\" that the kidnapping would have a de minimis effect on\n\ninterstate commerce. Nguyen, 246 F.3d at 54. Here, the kidnappers\n\nspecifically instructed Carter to liquidate $100,000 of his mutual\n\nfunds after they learned that he could not meet a one million\n\ndollar demand.     These funds, both parties agree, were managed by\n\ncompanies in interstate commerce and were themselves traded in\n\ninterstate commerce; if Carter had sold them, as the kidnappers had\n\ndemanded, both parties agree that \"the sale would have reduced the\n\nvalue of the companies that managed the funds and the mutual funds\n\nthemselves.\"     Numerous courts have opined that the extortion of an\n\nindividual can satisfy the commerce element of the Hobbs Act when\n\nit \"cause[s] or create[s] the likelihood that the individual will\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fdeplete the assets of an entity engaged in interstate commerce.\"\n\nUnited States v. Collins, 40 F.3d 95, 100 (5th Cir. 1994); see also\n\nLynch, 282 F.3d at 1054-55; United States v. Diaz, 248 F.3d 1065,\n\n1085 (11th Cir. 2001).        The kidnappers' demand did just that.\n\n            Further, the kidnappers told Carter to liquidate his\n\nmutual funds slowly, in increments under $10,000.            A rational jury\n\ncould have concluded that the purpose of this instruction was to\n\nevade federal regulatory oversight of large financial transactions.\n\nCf. 31 U.S.C. § 5313; 31 C.F.R. § 103.22 (requiring many financial\n\ninstitutions to file currency reports when they participate in a\n\ntransaction involving currency of more than $10,000).               The jury\n\ncould have concluded that the kidnappers' instruction to Carter\n\ndirectly undermined the federal regulation of substantial monetary\n\ntransactions, and thus affected interstate commerce.                Taken in\n\nconjunction with the instruction to liquidate appreciable sums from\n\nmutual funds that were traded in interstate commerce, the jury had\n\nmore than sufficient evidence to conclude rationally that there was\n\na reasonable probability that McCormack's criminal activity, if\n\nsuccessful, would have had a de minimis effect on interstate\n\ncommerce.\n\nB.   McCormack's Sentence\n\n            McCormack    also   challenges    the    188-month   sentence   he\n\nreceived,   which   he   says   violates     the    Sentencing   Commission's\n\nstatutory    mandate     to   \"provid[e]     certainty    and    fairness   in\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fsentencing and reduc[e] unwarranted sentence disparities.\"                        28\n\nU.S.C. § 994(f).     McCormack admits that he did not raise this issue\n\nin front of the district court, and so our review is only for plain\n\nerror. United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733-36 (1993).                    Under\n\nthe plain error test, McCormack bears the burden of demonstrating\n\n\"(1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial\n\nrights (i.e., the error was not harmless), and (4) that seriously\n\nundermines    the   fairness,       integrity,       or   public    reputation   of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"           United States v. Fazal-Ur-Raheman-Fazal,\n\n355 F.3d 40, 48 (1st Cir. 2004); see United States v. Geronimo, 330\n\nF.3d 67, 74-75 (1st Cir. 2003) (burden is on the defendant).\n\n             McCormack's argument is that his sentence is longer than\n\nit   would   have   been    if    the    jury      had   convicted,   rather    than\n\nacquitted,    him   of     the    firearm     charge.       The    reason,   claims\n\nMcCormack, is that the district court increased his base offense\n\nlevel by seven for his Hobbs Act offenses because a firearm was\n\ndischarged     in   the    course       of   the    kidnapping.3      U.S.S.G.     §\n\n\n      3\n      This enhancement was permissible even though McCormack was\nacquitted of the firearm offense. There are differences in both\nthe standard of liability and the government's burden of proof\nbetween the § 924(c) offense and the sentencing enhancements for\npossession or use of a firearm. The crime requires proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the firearm was, actually or constructively,\ncarried or used in a crime of violence. See United States v. Cruz,\n352 F.3d 499, 509-10 (1st Cir. 2003). The sentencing enhancements\nrelating to firearms, by contrast, require only proof by a\npreponderance of the evidence of the relevant conduct. See United\nStates v. Rodriguez, 112 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 1997). Even if the\nconduct involved is the same, acquitted conduct may be used for\nsentencing. Id.\n\n                                         -14-\n\f2B3.2(b)(3).    As a result of this seven-level enhancement (which\n\nMcCormack admits was applicable on its face), McCormack's total\n\noffense level increased from 28 to 35,4 which, given his Criminal\n\nHistory Category of II, raised the applicable sentencing range from\n\n87-108 months to 188-235 months, see id. ch. 5 pt. A.             The judge\n\nsentenced McCormack at the low end of this range, imposing a 188-\n\nmonth sentence.\n\n           But if the jury had convicted him of the firearm charge\n\npursuant   to   §    924(c),   McCormack   argues,   then   the   Sentencing\n\nGuidelines would have directed the judge not to apply the firearm\n\nenhancement.        See id. § 2K2.4 cmt. 4.      Although the § 924(c)\n\nconviction would have added 60 months to his sentence,5 see 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(c)(1), this would have resulted in a sentencing range\n\nof only 147-168 months, which, even if the judge imposed the\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      The base offense level under the Guidelines is 18, but\nMcCormack also received several other enhancements, which are not\nchallenged on appeal, that increased his offense level to 28.\nThese included a two-level enhancement because the offense involved\nthe express or implied threat of death, § 2B3.2(b)(1); a two-level\nenhancement because the amount demanded was more than $50,000 but\nless than $250,000, § 2B3.1(b)(7); a two-level enhancement due to\nthe victim's bodily injury, § 2B3.2(b)(4)(A); and a four-level\nincrease because a person was abducted to facilitate the offense,\n§ 2B3.2(b)(5).\n     5\n      The statute was amended in 1998 to provide for a ten-year\nsentence when a firearm is discharged.   Pub. L. No. 105-386, §\n1(a), 112 Stat. 3496, 3496 (Nov. 13, 1998). At the time of the\noffense, however, the statute provided for only a five-year\nsentence.\n\n                                    -15-\n\fmaximum, is still 20 months fewer than the 188-month sentence he\n\nreceived.\n\n            As McCormack admits, the Sentencing Guidelines anticipate\n\nthis anomaly.   To avoid the possibility of inconsistent sentences,\n\nthe application notes to the provision dealing with violations of\n\n§ 924(c), provide, in relevant part, that:\n\n     In a few cases in which the defendant is determined not\n     to be a career offender, the offense level for the\n     underlying offense . . . may result in a guideline range\n     that, when combined with the mandatory consecutive\n     sentence under 18 U.S.C. . . . § 924(c). . . , produces\n     a total maximum penalty that is less than the maximum of\n     the guideline range that would have resulted had there\n     not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. . . . §\n     924(c) . . . (i.e., the guideline range that would have\n     resulted if the enhancements for possession, use, or\n     discharge of a firearm had been applied).     In such a\n     case, an upward departure may be warranted so that [a]\n     conviction under . . . § 924(c) . . . does not result in\n     a decrease in the total punishment. An upward departure\n     under this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum of the\n     guideline range that would have resulted had there not\n     been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. . . . §\n     924(c). . . .\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2K2.4 cmt. 4 (emphasis added).      See generally United\n\nStates v. Hickey, 280 F.3d 65, 68 (1st Cir. 2002).    Several courts\n\nhave affirmed such upward departures.    See, e.g., United States v.\n\nBanks-Giombetti, 245 F.3d 949, 953-54 (7th Cir. 2001); United\n\nStates v. Collins, 226 F.3d 457, 465-66 (6th Cir. 2000); United\n\nStates v. Johnson-Dix, 54 F.3d 1295, 1310-11 (7th Cir. 1995).    The\n\ngovernment reasons that because of this provision it is not likely\n\nthat McCormack would have received a lesser sentence had he been\n\nconvicted of the § 924(c) charge.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f            McCormack contends that this solution is insufficient to\n\nmeet the statutory mandate of avoiding unwarranted disparities in\n\nsentences because the district court retains discretion not to\n\ndepart upward when a § 924(c) conviction has the effect of reducing\n\na defendant's sentence.     McCormack says that the result of this\n\ndiscretion is that it is preferable in certain circumstances, from\n\nthe defendant's point of view, to be convicted under § 924(c).   The\n\nsentencing range in such cases can be no higher than if the\n\ndefendant were acquitted, see § 2K2.4 cmt. 4, and there is at least\n\nthe possibility of convincing a sympathetic judge not to depart\n\nupward.     Because of this potential, McCormack argues that the\n\nGuidelines are inconsistent with the statutory command in 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 944(f).\n\n            We are doubtful that the mere potential for a disparity\n\nin sentences is enough to put the Guidelines and statute into\n\nconflict, especially given the application note.   The existence of\n\na potential disparity is nonetheless a very good reason for defense\n\ncounsel to present the issue to the sentencing judge.   That was not\n\ndone here.     We cannot say that there was plain error because\n\nMcCormack cannot show that his \"substantial rights\" were affected.\n\nFazal-Ur-Raheman-Fazal, 355 F.3d at 48.      There is no reason to\n\nassume that if McCormack had been convicted of the firearm offense\n\nin § 924(c) then he would have been sentenced according to the 147-\n\n168 month range that he calculates.     The district court may well\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fhave departed upward, as encouraged by the Guidelines.    In fact,\n\nthe district court could have departed upward beyond the 188-month\n\nsentence that McCormack received, up to 235 months, the maximum of\n\nthe Guidelines range that McCormack faced.    See § 2K2.4 cmt. 4.\n\nMcCormack's acquittal on the § 924(c) count may well have been what\n\ninfluenced the judge to sentence at the low end of the available\n\nrange.   We add that the use of firearms during the kidnapping was\n\na very serious matter, and the judge was well within his authority\n\nin giving the sentence that he did.\n\n                               III.\n\n           McCormack's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -18-\n\f",

After violently abducting Carter from his home, McCormack and his fellow kidnappers threatened to kill and torture him unless they were paid a million dollars. When Carter pleaded that he only possessed about $300,000 in mutual funds and other non-liquid assets, the kidnappers agreed to release him and told him to liquidate his mutual funds in small increments until he could pay them $100,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack was eventually apprehended and convicted by a jury of both attempting and conspiring to violate the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a). He was acquitted of using and carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, <i>id.</i> &#167; 924(c). He was sentenced to serve 188 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the Hobbs Act convictions because no rational jury could have found that his actions would have at least a de minimis effect on interstate commerce. We reject this claim. In doing so, we do not adopt the government's test that a particular amount of money (here $100,000) is per se sufficient to meet the commerce element of a Hobbs Act offense. McCormack also argues that his sentence is plainly erroneous because it is longer than it would have been had the jury convicted, rather than acquitted, him of the firearm offense. This sentencing argument has a common-sense appeal, especially to anyone not familiar with the specialized world of the federal sentencing guidelines. But in this case, McCormack cannot show plain error because he cannot bear his burden of demonstrating that he was harmed. Consequently, we affirm his 188-month sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are described, for purposes of McCormack's sufficiency of the evidence challenge, as a reasonable jury could have found them, in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>United States v. Casas,</i> 356 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in 1997, James McCormack was approached by his friend and fellow Charlestown, Massachusetts resident, James Dagle, and asked about his willingness to participate in the possible robbery or kidnapping of James Carter. Dagle, a long-time criminal, explained to McCormack that he had learned from his attorney, Fred Ford, that Carter had accumulated large sums of money in the early 1980s from selling marijuana. Although Carter was eventually convicted and served eighteen months in prison in the late 1980s, he was fined only $15,000, and his assets were not forfeited. Dagle told McCormack that robbing or kidnapping Carter, who had recently moved back to the Boston area and was self-employed in the real estate business, could be potentially lucrative, and that Ford wanted to gauge McCormack's interest in participating in such a scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack, who independently knew that Carter had made a lot of money by selling drugs in the 1980s, told Dagle he was interested. Thereafter, Ford, Dagle and McCormack met several times to determine how they could find where Carter was living. Eventually, Ford learned that Carter was living with his family in Carlisle, Massachusetts. Ford<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> passed this information to McCormack and Dagle, who arranged to obtain Carter's address from records in the Carlisle Town Hall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack and Dagle started watching Carter's house to see if there was an opportunity to break in while nobody was home. After ten or fifteen multiple-hour surveillance missions, the pair determined that Carter's house was rarely, if ever, empty. They told Ford that they did not believe that burglary of Carter's house was a feasible option, and Ford urged them to pursue the kidnapping plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1998, McCormack organized a meeting with Dagle and two other acquaintances he had recruited, Phil Myers and Richard Hegarty, to discuss kidnapping Carter. McCormack proposed that the group wait outside of Carter's house and abduct him from his driveway immediately after he returned home from dropping off his two children at school. McCormack was familiar with Carter's schedule as a result of his surveillance activities. The group also discussed who would obtain the necessary equipment for conducting the kidnapping, and Dagle was put in charge of procuring several handguns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Less than an hour after the meeting ended, Dagle met with McCormack and provided him with the promised guns, but told him that he no longer wanted to participate in the kidnapping. With the help of Myers, McCormack replaced Dagle with Dennis Quirk. The reconstituted group, which included McCormack, Myers, Hegarty, and Quirk, met several more times to finalize the details of the plan. On about April 10, 1998, Hegarty and Myers stole two cars and a van for use in the kidnapping, which was planned to take place a week later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of April 17, 1998, the four conspirators met at a designated location in Somerville, Massachusetts. They were joined by a fifth person, Francis Lang, whom Hegarty and Quirk had recruited. McCormack put the guns that Dagle had supplied in the stolen car, along with handcuffs, gloves and hats. At least Quirk and Lang were given guns. McCormack, accompanied by Myers, then drove the stolen van up to Carter's house and waited in a small bend part-way up Carter's long driveway. The other three drove the stolen car to the school that one of Carter's children attended. When they saw Carter returning from dropping off his child at the school, they radioed McCormack and Myers and then followed Carter home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Carter pulled into his driveway, his path forward was blocked by the van; once Carter stopped his car, he was boxed-in from behind by the car driven by Hegarty. Myers and Quirk, who were wearing stockings over their heads and vests that read \"FBI,\" approached Carter's SUV, and Myers told Carter that he was under arrest. Carter attempted to escape by ramming his SUV into the van; in response, Quirk fired his gun into the front of Carter's vehicle. Myers then pulled Carter out of the window of the jeep using a choke hold and dragged him into the van, where he was handcuffed, blindfolded, and bound with duct tape. In the process, Lang, who had gotten into the van, hit Carter in the face with the butt of a gun and broke several of his front teeth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack, who was driving the van, sped off once Carter was inside. Followed by Quirk, who was driving Carter's SUV, and Hegarty, who was still in the stolen car, McCormack drove the van to Charlestown. During the drive, Myers and Quirk threatened to kill Carter unless he paid them a million dollars. Carter explained that he did not have that much money, but said that he did own about $300,000 in mutual funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After picking up Quirk, who had ditched Carter's SUV when it ran out of gas, McCormack drove the van to a warehouse in Charlestown. There, the kidnappers transferred the bound and blindfolded Carter into a laundry cart, which McCormack had arranged beforehand, and wheeled him inside the warehouse. The kidnappers took shifts interrogating Carter about how much money he had and where he kept it. Throughout, they hit Carter, poked him with knives, and threatened to torture him and cut off parts of his body. Carter pleaded that while he was once a marijuana dealer, he no longer dealt drugs; he had invested most of the money he made while dealing drugs in real estate, mutual funds, and stocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, McCormack told Carter that he would be released so that he could sell his mutual funds and turn over $100,000 to the kidnappers. Carter was instructed to liquidate his mutual funds slowly, in increments under $10,000, and was told that somebody named \"Sam\" would call him with follow-up instructions. If he refused to pay the money or contacted the police, Carter was told that both he and his family would be killed. Keeping Carter bound and blindfolded, the kidnappers then removed his bloodied clothing, dressed him in new clothing, and dropped him off at the side of a road in Woburn, Massachusetts. Carter eventually found his way to a telephone and contacted his family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, after Carter spoke with his attorney, he reported the kidnapping to the Carlisle police. He also had extensive dental work done on his broken front teeth and learned that he had suffered a small stroke during the ordeal. As a result of the stroke, Carter suffers from several permanent disabilities: he slurs his speech, has a slight limp, and has problems maintaining his balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several days after Carter reported the kidnapping to the police, his SUV, which had a bullet hole in its fender, was recovered. Carter also received several messages from \"Sam\" on his answering machine; the voice was McCormack's. But it was not until Myers was arrested in September of 1998 on an unrelated matter that the police learned who was behind Carter's abduction. Myers led officers to Dagle, who agreed to cooperate with authorities. Dagle recorded several conversations with McCormack in which the two discussed the Carter kidnapping and whether they would be caught by the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 21, 2000, a superseding indictment was filed in the District of Massachusetts that charged McCormack, inter alia, with conspiring and attempting to obstruct commerce by robbery and extortion, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a) (Hobbs Act), and with using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, <i>id.</i> &#167; 924(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> After a five-day trial in which both Dagle and Myers testified and McCormack's incriminating recorded statements were presented to the jury, McCormack was convicted on the Hobbs Act counts, but acquitted of the firearm charge. On November 5, 2002, the district court sentenced McCormack to 188 months of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because McCormack moved under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 for a judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence, he has fully preserved his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. <i>United States v. Van Horn,</i> 277 F.3d 48, 54 (1st Cir.2002). Our review is de novo. <i>United States v. Cornier-Ortiz,</i> 361 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir.2004). The issue is whether a rational factfinder, considering all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Carter's kidnapping \"in any way or degree obstruct[ed], delay[ed] or affect[ed] commerce,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a). <i>See United States v. Boulerice,</i> 325 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir.2003) (standard of review for denials of Rule 29 motions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The commerce element of a &#167; 1951(a) offense extends to the limit of Congress's Commerce Clause authority. <i>Stirone v. United States,</i> 361 U.S. 212, 215, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960); <i>United States v. Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d 327, 335 (1st Cir.2003). It reaches all conduct that creates a \"realistic probability of a de minimis effect on interstate commerce.\" <i>Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 335 (quoting <i>United States v. Butt,</i> 955 F.2d 77, 80 n. 2 (1st Cir.1992)). Under this standard, it is the purpose of the conspiracy, rather than the result the conspirators achieve, that is relevant in determining the impact on commerce. <i>United States v. Nguyen,</i> 246 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir.2001). Importantly, the de minimis test under the Hobbs Act remains applicable after the Supreme Court's Commerce Clause decisions in <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000). <i>See Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 335-36.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the kidnappers' extortionate demand of $100,000, standing alone, is sufficient to satisfy the Hobbs Act's commerce element under the de minimis effects test. It argues that any reasonable factfinder would conclude that, in order to satisfy such an exorbitant demand, the victim would need to liquidate assets in a manner affecting interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to adopt any bright-line rule that an extortionate demand of a certain sum from an individual can automatically satisfy the commerce element of the Hobbs Act. Determining whether an act has a reasonable probability of having a \"de minimis effect\" on interstate commerce inherently requires a multifaceted and case-specific inquiry. <i>See United States v. Carcione,</i> 272 F.3d 1297, 1301 n. 6 (11th Cir.2001) (\"[W]e have repeatedly held that in determining whether there is a minimal effect on commerce, each case must be decided on its own facts.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Moreover, it is far from clear that, as the government asserts, a $100,000 demand would necessarily require transactions affecting interstate commerce in every case: many people would simply have no way of gathering $100,000 together, whereas those specifically targeted because of their access to money may well be able to satisfy such a demand without resort to large financial transactions affecting interstate commerce. Finally, the government's proposed standard does not adequately distinguish between the extortion or robbery of a business and that of an individual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack, ably represented, seizes on this last point to argue that the evidence is too attenuated here because the victim was an individual rather than a business or institution and was targeted because he was believed to have cash on hand. He correctly points out that the victim's connection to a business entity is an important, though not dispositive, consideration in determining whether the commerce element of a Hobbs Act violation can be met. <i>Cf. United States v. Perrotta,</i> 313 F.3d 33, 36 (2d Cir.2002) (there is a significant distinction between \"the extortion of an individual and the extortion of a business for the purposes of establishing Hobbs Act jurisdiction\"). Because criminal acts that are directed at individuals rather than at businesses normally have a less substantial effect on interstate commerce, courts have often required a heightened showing of an effect on commerce to sustain such Hobbs Act convictions. <i>See id.; United States v. Lynch,</i> 282 F.3d 1049, 1054 (9th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Wang,</i> 222 F.3d 234, 238-40 (6th Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Quigley,</i> 53 F.3d 909, 910-11 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence here satisfies this heightened standard. A reasonable jury could have concluded that there was a \"realistic probability\" that the kidnapping would have a de minimis effect on interstate commerce. <i>Nguyen,</i> 246 F.3d at 54. Here, the kidnappers <i>specifically instructed</i> Carter to liquidate $100,000 of his mutual funds after they learned that he could not meet a one million dollar demand. These funds, both parties agree, were managed by companies in interstate commerce and were themselves traded in interstate commerce; if Carter had sold them, as the kidnappers had demanded, both parties agree that \"the sale would have reduced the value of the companies that managed the funds and the mutual funds themselves.\" Numerous courts have opined that the extortion of an individual can satisfy the commerce element of the Hobbs Act when it \"cause[s] or create[s] the likelihood that the individual will deplete the assets of an entity engaged in interstate commerce.\" <i>United States v. Collins,</i> 40 F.3d 95, 100 (5th Cir.1994); <i>see also Lynch,</i> 282 F.3d at 1054-55; <i>United States v. Diaz,</i> 248 F.3d 1065, 1085 (11th Cir.2001). The kidnappers' demand did just that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the kidnappers told Carter to liquidate his mutual funds slowly, in increments under $10,000. A rational jury could have concluded that the purpose of this instruction was to evade federal regulatory oversight of large financial transactions. <i>Cf.</i> 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5313; 31 C.F.R. &#167; 103.22 (requiring many financial institutions to file currency reports when they participate in a transaction involving currency of more than $10,000). The jury could have concluded that the kidnappers' instruction to Carter directly undermined the federal regulation of substantial monetary transactions, and thus affected interstate commerce. This possibility, taken in conjunction with the instruction to liquidate appreciable sums from mutual funds that were traded in interstate commerce, gave the jury more than sufficient evidence to conclude rationally that there was a reasonable probability that McCormack's criminal activity, if successful, would have had a de minimis effect on interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>McCormack's Sentence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack also challenges the 188-month sentence he received, which he says violates the Sentencing Commission's statutory mandate to \"provid [e] certainty and fairness in sentencing and reduc[e] unwarranted sentence disparities.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(f). McCormack admits that he did not raise this issue in front of the district court, and so our review is only for plain error. <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 733-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Under the plain error test, McCormack bears the burden of demonstrating \"(1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights (<i>i.e.,</i> the error was not harmless), and (4) that seriously undermines the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Fazal-Ur-Raheman-Fazal,</i> 355 F.3d 40, 48 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see United States v. Geronimo,</i> 330 F.3d 67, 74-75 (1st Cir.2003) (burden is on the defendant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack's argument is that his sentence is longer than it would have been if the jury had convicted, rather than acquitted, him of the firearm charge. The reason, claims McCormack, is that the district court increased his base offense level by seven for his Hobbs Act offenses because a firearm was discharged in the course of the kidnapping.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.2(b)(3). As a result of this seven-level enhancement (which McCormack admits was applicable on its face), McCormack's total offense level increased from 28 to 35,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> which, given his Criminal History Category of II, raised the applicable sentencing range from 87-108 months to 188-235 months, <i>see id.</i> ch. 5 pt. A. The judge sentenced McCormack at the low end of this range, imposing a 188-month sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if the jury had convicted him of the firearm charge pursuant to &#167; 924(c), McCormack argues, then the Sentencing Guidelines would have directed the judge <i>not</i> to apply the firearm enhancement. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2K2.4 cmt. 4. Although the &#167; 924(c) conviction would have added 60 months to his sentence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1), this would have resulted in a sentencing range of only 147-168 months, which, even if the judge imposed the maximum, is still 20 months shorter than the 188-month sentence he received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As McCormack admits, the Sentencing Guidelines anticipate this anomaly. To avoid the possibility of inconsistent sentences, the application notes to the provision dealing with violations of &#167; 924(c), provide, in relevant part, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a few cases in which the defendant is determined not to be a career offender, the offense level for the underlying offense ... may result in a guideline range that, when combined with the mandatory consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C .... &#167; 924(c) ..., produces a total maximum penalty that is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C .... &#167; 924(c) ... (i.e., the guideline range that would have resulted if the enhancements for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm had been applied). <i>In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted so that [a] conviction under ... &#167; 924(c) ... does not result in a decrease in the total punishment.</i> An upward departure under this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C .... &#167; 924(c)....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4 cmt. 4 (emphasis added). <i>See generally United States v. Hickey,</i> 280 F.3d 65, 68 (1st Cir.2002). Several courts have affirmed such upward departures. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Banks-Giombetti,</i> 245 F.3d 949, 953-54 (7th Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Collins,</i> 226 F.3d 457, 465-66 (6th Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Johnson-Dix,</i> 54 F.3d 1295, 1310-11 (7th Cir.1995). The government reasons that because of this provision it is not likely that McCormack would have received a lesser sentence had he been convicted of the &#167; 924(c) charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack contends that this solution is insufficient to meet the statutory mandate of avoiding unwarranted disparities in sentences because the district court retains discretion not to depart upward when a &#167; 924(c) conviction has the effect of reducing a defendant's sentence. McCormack says that the result of this discretion is that it is preferable in certain circumstances, from the defendant's point of view, to be <i>convicted</i> under &#167; 924(c). The sentencing range in such cases can be no higher than if the defendant were acquitted, <i>see</i> &#167; 2K2.4 cmt. 4, and there is at least the possibility of convincing a sympathetic judge not to depart upward. Because of this potential, McCormack argues that the Guidelines are inconsistent with the statutory command in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are doubtful that the mere potential for a disparity in sentences is enough to put the Guidelines and statute into conflict, especially given the application note. The existence of a potential disparity is nonetheless a very good reason for defense counsel to present the issue to the sentencing judge. That was not done here. We cannot say that there was plain error because McCormack cannot show that his \"substantial rights\" were affected. <i>Fazal-Ur-Raheman-Fazal,</i> 355 F.3d at 48. There is no reason to assume that if McCormack had been convicted of the firearm offense in &#167; 924(c) then he would have been sentenced according to the 147-168 month range that he calculates. The district court may well have departed upward, as encouraged by the Guidelines. In fact, the district court could have departed upward beyond the 188-month sentence that McCormack received, up to 235 months, the maximum of the Guidelines range that McCormack faced. <i>See</i> &#167; 2K2.4 cmt. 4. McCormack's acquittal on the &#167; 924(c) count may well have been what influenced the judge to sentence at the low end of the available range. We add that the use of firearms during the kidnapping was a very serious matter, and the judge was well within his authority in giving the sentence that he did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack's conviction and sentence are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Attorney Ford was eventually convicted of attempting to hire an undercover agent to kill McCormack and Dagle because he feared that they would cooperate with authorities against him in connection with the Carter kidnapping</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The indictment also charged McCormack with conspiracy and attempt to possess with the intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine.

Cruz,</i> 352 F.3d 499, 509-10 (1st Cir.2003). The sentencing enhancements relating to firearms, by contrast, require only proof by a preponderance of the evidence of the relevant conduct. <i>See United States v.

After violently abducting Carter from his home, McCormack and his fellow kidnappers threatened to kill and torture him unless they were paid a million dollars. When Carter pleaded that he only possessed about $300,000 in mutual funds and other non-liquid assets, the kidnappers agreed to release him and told him to liquidate his mutual funds in small increments until he could pay them $100,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack was eventually apprehended and convicted by a jury of both attempting and conspiring to violate the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a).

We reject this claim. In doing so, we do not adopt the government's test that a particular amount of money (here $100,000) is per se sufficient to meet the commerce element of a Hobbs Act offense. McCormack also argues that his sentence is plainly erroneous because it is longer than it would have been had the jury convicted, rather than acquitted, him of the firearm offense. This sentencing argument has a common-sense appeal, especially to anyone not familiar with the specialized world of the federal sentencing guidelines. But in this case, McCormack cannot show plain error because he cannot bear his burden of demonstrating that he was harmed. Consequently, we affirm his 188-month sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are described, for purposes of McCormack's sufficiency of the evidence challenge, as a reasonable jury could have found them, in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>United States v.

Dagle, a long-time criminal, explained to McCormack that he had learned from his attorney, Fred Ford, that Carter had accumulated large sums of money in the early 1980s from selling marijuana. Although Carter was eventually convicted and served eighteen months in prison in the late 1980s, he was fined only $15,000, and his assets were not forfeited. Dagle told McCormack that robbing or kidnapping Carter, who had recently moved back to the Boston area and was self-employed in the real estate business, could be potentially lucrative, and that Ford wanted to gauge McCormack's interest in participating in such a scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack, who independently knew that Carter had made a lot of money by selling drugs in the 1980s, told Dagle he was interested. Thereafter, Ford, Dagle and McCormack met several times to determine how they could find where Carter was living. Eventually, Ford learned that Carter was living with his family in Carlisle, Massachusetts. Ford<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> passed this information to McCormack and Dagle, who arranged to obtain Carter's address from records in the Carlisle Town Hall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack and Dagle started watching Carter's house to see if there was an opportunity to break in while nobody was home. After ten or fifteen multiple-hour surveillance missions, the pair determined that Carter's house was rarely, if ever, empty. They told Ford that they did not believe that burglary of Carter's house was a feasible option, and Ford urged them to pursue the kidnapping plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1998, McCormack organized a meeting with Dagle and two other acquaintances he had recruited, Phil Myers and Richard Hegarty, to discuss kidnapping Carter. McCormack proposed that the group wait outside of Carter's house and abduct him from his driveway immediately after he returned home from dropping off his two children at school. McCormack was familiar with Carter's schedule as a result of his surveillance activities. The group also discussed who would obtain the necessary equipment for conducting the kidnapping, and Dagle was put in charge of procuring several handguns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Less than an hour after the meeting ended, Dagle met with McCormack and provided him with the promised guns, but told him that he no longer wanted to participate in the kidnapping. With the help of Myers, McCormack replaced Dagle with Dennis Quirk. The reconstituted group, which included McCormack, Myers, Hegarty, and Quirk, met several more times to finalize the details of the plan. On about April 10, 1998, Hegarty and Myers stole two cars and a van for use in the kidnapping, which was planned to take place a week later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of April 17, 1998, the four conspirators met at a designated location in Somerville, Massachusetts. They were joined by a fifth person, Francis Lang, whom Hegarty and Quirk had recruited. McCormack put the guns that Dagle had supplied in the stolen car, along with handcuffs, gloves and hats. At least Quirk and Lang were given guns. McCormack, accompanied by Myers, then drove the stolen van up to Carter's house and waited in a small bend part-way up Carter's long driveway. The other three drove the stolen car to the school that one of Carter's children attended. When they saw Carter returning from dropping off his child at the school, they radioed McCormack and Myers and then followed Carter home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Carter pulled into his driveway, his path forward was blocked by the van; once Carter stopped his car, he was boxed-in from behind by the car driven by Hegarty. Myers and Quirk, who were wearing stockings over their heads and vests that read \"FBI,\" approached Carter's SUV, and Myers told Carter that he was under arrest. Carter attempted to escape by ramming his SUV into the van; in response, Quirk fired his gun into the front of Carter's vehicle. Myers then pulled Carter out of the window of the jeep using a choke hold and dragged him into the van, where he was handcuffed, blindfolded, and bound with duct tape. In the process, Lang, who had gotten into the van, hit Carter in the face with the butt of a gun and broke several of his front teeth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack, who was driving the van, sped off once Carter was inside. Followed by Quirk, who was driving Carter's SUV, and Hegarty, who was still in the stolen car, McCormack drove the van to Charlestown. During the drive, Myers and Quirk threatened to kill Carter unless he paid them a million dollars. Carter explained that he did not have that much money, but said that he did own about $300,000 in mutual funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After picking up Quirk, who had ditched Carter's SUV when it ran out of gas, McCormack drove the van to a warehouse in Charlestown. There, the kidnappers transferred the bound and blindfolded Carter into a laundry cart, which McCormack had arranged beforehand, and wheeled him inside the warehouse. The kidnappers took shifts interrogating Carter about how much money he had and where he kept it. Throughout, they hit Carter, poked him with knives, and threatened to torture him and cut off parts of his body. Carter pleaded that while he was once a marijuana dealer, he no longer dealt drugs; he had invested most of the money he made while dealing drugs in real estate, mutual funds, and stocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, McCormack told Carter that he would be released so that he could sell his mutual funds and turn over $100,000 to the kidnappers. Carter was instructed to liquidate his mutual funds slowly, in increments under $10,000, and was told that somebody named \"Sam\" would call him with follow-up instructions. If he refused to pay the money or contacted the police, Carter was told that both he and his family would be killed. Keeping Carter bound and blindfolded, the kidnappers then removed his bloodied clothing, dressed him in new clothing, and dropped him off at the side of a road in Woburn, Massachusetts.

But it was not until Myers was arrested in September of 1998 on an unrelated matter that the police learned who was behind Carter's abduction. Myers led officers to Dagle, who agreed to cooperate with authorities.

Determining whether an act has a reasonable probability of having a \"de minimis effect\" on interstate commerce inherently requires a multifaceted and case-specific inquiry. <i>See United States v.

Moreover, it is far from clear that, as the government asserts, a $100,000 demand would necessarily require transactions affecting interstate commerce in every case: many people would simply have no way of gathering $100,000 together, whereas those specifically targeted because of their access to money may well be able to satisfy such a demand without resort to large financial transactions affecting interstate commerce. Finally, the government's proposed standard does not adequately distinguish between the extortion or robbery of a business and that of an individual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack, ably represented, seizes on this last point to argue that the evidence is too attenuated here because the victim was an individual rather than a business or institution and was targeted because he was believed to have cash on hand. He correctly points out that the victim's connection to a business entity is an important, though not dispositive, consideration in determining whether the commerce element of a Hobbs Act violation can be met. <i>Cf.

Because criminal acts that are directed at individuals rather than at businesses normally have a less substantial effect on interstate commerce, courts have often required a heightened showing of an effect on commerce to sustain such Hobbs Act convictions. <i>See id.; United States v.

Here, the kidnappers <i>specifically instructed</i> Carter to liquidate $100,000 of his mutual funds after they learned that he could not meet a one million dollar demand. These funds, both parties agree, were managed by companies in interstate commerce and were themselves traded in interstate commerce; if Carter had sold them, as the kidnappers had demanded, both parties agree that \"the sale would have reduced the value of the companies that managed the funds and the mutual funds themselves.\" Numerous courts have opined that the extortion of an individual can satisfy the commerce element of the Hobbs Act when it \"cause[s] or create[s] the likelihood that the individual will deplete the assets of an entity engaged in interstate commerce.\" <i>United States v.

The jury could have concluded that the kidnappers' instruction to Carter directly undermined the federal regulation of substantial monetary transactions, and thus affected interstate commerce. This possibility, taken in conjunction with the instruction to liquidate appreciable sums from mutual funds that were traded in interstate commerce, gave the jury more than sufficient evidence to conclude rationally that there was a reasonable probability that McCormack's criminal activity, if successful, would have had a de minimis effect on interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>McCormack's Sentence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack also challenges the 188-month sentence he received, which he says violates the Sentencing Commission's statutory mandate to \"provid [e] certainty and fairness in sentencing and reduc[e] unwarranted sentence disparities.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(f).

The reason, claims McCormack, is that the district court increased his base offense level by seven for his Hobbs Act offenses because a firearm was discharged in the course of the kidnapping.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.2(b)(3). As a result of this seven-level enhancement (which McCormack admits was applicable on its face), McCormack's total offense level increased from 28 to 35,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> which, given his Criminal History Category of II, raised the applicable sentencing range from 87-108 months to 188-235 months, <i>see id.</i> ch. 5 pt.

Although the &#167; 924(c) conviction would have added 60 months to his sentence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1), this would have resulted in a sentencing range of only 147-168 months, which, even if the judge imposed the maximum, is still 20 months shorter than the 188-month sentence he received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As McCormack admits, the Sentencing Guidelines anticipate this anomaly. To avoid the possibility of inconsistent sentences, the application notes to the provision dealing with violations of &#167; 924(c), provide, in relevant part, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a few cases in which the defendant is determined not to be a career offender, the offense level for the underlying offense ... may result in a guideline range that, when combined with the mandatory consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C .... &#167; 924(c) ..., produces a total maximum penalty that is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C .... &#167; 924(c) ...

The government reasons that because of this provision it is not likely that McCormack would have received a lesser sentence had he been convicted of the &#167; 924(c) charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack contends that this solution is insufficient to meet the statutory mandate of avoiding unwarranted disparities in sentences because the district court retains discretion not to depart upward when a &#167; 924(c) conviction has the effect of reducing a defendant's sentence. McCormack says that the result of this discretion is that it is preferable in certain circumstances, from the defendant's point of view, to be <i>convicted</i> under &#167; 924(c). The sentencing range in such cases can be no higher than if the defendant were acquitted, <i>see</i> &#167; 2K2.4 cmt. 4, and there is at least the possibility of convincing a sympathetic judge not to depart upward. Because of this potential, McCormack argues that the Guidelines are inconsistent with the statutory command in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are doubtful that the mere potential for a disparity in sentences is enough to put the Guidelines and statute into conflict, especially given the application note. The existence of a potential disparity is nonetheless a very good reason for defense counsel to present the issue to the sentencing judge. That was not done here. We cannot say that there was plain error because McCormack cannot show that his \"substantial rights\" were affected. <i>Fazal-Ur-Raheman-Fazal,</i> 355 F.3d at 48. There is no reason to assume that if McCormack had been convicted of the firearm offense in &#167; 924(c) then he would have been sentenced according to the 147-168 month range that he calculates. The district court may well have departed upward, as encouraged by the Guidelines. In fact, the district court could have departed upward beyond the 188-month sentence that McCormack received, up to 235 months, the maximum of the Guidelines range that McCormack faced. <i>See</i> &#167; 2K2.4 cmt. 4. McCormack's acquittal on the &#167; 924(c) count may well have been what influenced the judge to sentence at the low end of the available range. We add that the use of firearms during the kidnapping was a very serious matter, and the judge was well within his authority in giving the sentence that he did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCormack's conviction and sentence are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Attorney Ford was eventually convicted of attempting to hire an undercover agent to kill McCormack and Dagle because he feared that they would cooperate with authorities against him in connection with the Carter kidnapping</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The indictment also charged McCormack with conspiracy and attempt to possess with the intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine.

Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200775\"><a href=\"/opinion/200775/united-states-v-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 509-10 (1st Cir.2003). The sentencing enhancements relating to firearms, by contrast, require only proof by a preponderance of the evidence of the relevant conduct. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197336\"><a href=\"/opinion/197336/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1997). Even if the conduct involved is the same, acquitted conduct may be used for sentencing. <i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The base offense level under the Guidelines is 18, but McCormack also received several other enhancements, which are not challenged on appeal, that increased his offense level to 28. These included a two-level enhancement because the offense involved the express or implied threat of death, &#167; 2B3.2(b)(1); a two-level enhancement because the amount demanded was more than $50,000 but less than $250,000, &#167; 2B3.1(b)(7); a two-level enhancement due to the victim's bodily injury, &#167; 2B3.2(b)(4)(A); and a four-level increase because a person was abducted to facilitate the offense, &#167; 2B3.2(b)(5)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The statute was amended in 1998 to provide for a ten-year sentence when a firearm is discharged.
