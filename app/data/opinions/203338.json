Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                  Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n             and DiClerico, Jr., Senior District Judge.*\n\n\n\n     Robert R. Pierce, with whom Christopher D. Engebretson and\nPierce & Mandell, P.C. were on brief, for plaintiff, appellee.\n     Victor H. Polk, Jr., with whom Ralph C. Martin, II, Joshua M.\nDalton, Lawrence T. Stanley, Jr., and Bingham McCutchen LLP, were\non brief for defendant, appellant.\n\n\n\n                            June 18, 2008\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f              LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.         In this trademark infringement\n\ndispute,   defendant-appellant        Super    Duck   Tours   (\"Super   Duck\")\n\nappeals a preliminary injunction granted in favor of plaintiff-\n\nappellee Boston Duck Tours (\"Boston Duck\").               Asserting that the\n\nphrase \"duck tour\" and the image of a duck splashing in water are\n\ngeneric, and therefore that there is no likelihood of confusion\n\nbetween Boston Duck's marks and Super Duck's marks, appellant\n\nrequests that we dissolve the injunction requiring the alteration\n\nof its trade name and logo.       Appellee has also cross-appealed the\n\norder of the district court, arguing that the court committed clear\n\nerror by not enjoining Super Duck from using the term \"duck\" in its\n\ntrade name.\n\n              After carefully reviewing the record in this dispute, we\n\nconclude that the district court committed clear error by finding\n\nthe phrase \"duck tour\" nongeneric, and thereby according it too\n\nmuch weight in its likelihood of confusion analysis. Consequently,\n\nthe   court    erred   in   issuing   a     preliminary   injunction,    which\n\nprevented Super Duck from using the phrase \"duck tour\" in its own\n\ntrade name.      The district court also clearly erred in finding a\n\nlikelihood of confusion between Super Duck's and Boston Duck's\n\ndesign marks.     Therefore, the court also should not have issued an\n\ninjunction preventing Super Duck from using its design mark.               We\n\ndismiss Boston Duck's cross-appeal as moot given our resolution of\n\nthe other issues.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                                 I.\n\nA.   Duck Tours\n\n           We recite the background facts here, adding additional\n\ninformation throughout the analysis where appropriate. Both Boston\n\nDuck and Super Duck are in the business of offering sightseeing\n\ntours via land and water in Boston, using amphibious vehicles\n\ncommonly referred to as \"ducks.\"   The idea to market such tours to\n\nthe public was hatched by Melvin Flath shortly after World War II.\n\nHe purchased DUKWs (pronounced \"ducks\"), amphibious army vehicles\n\nused in the war to function as both trucks and boats, and fitted\n\nthem with bus seats.       His company, based in Wisconsin Dells,\n\nWisconsin, became the first purveyor of such tours in the country.\n\n           Recently, these amphibious tours have surfaced in many\n\ncities in the United States and abroad, including San Francisco,\n\nPhiladelphia, Seattle, Chicago, and London.    Many of the companies\n\nthat offer these tours use the phrase \"duck tour\" in their trade\n\nnames as a way of describing their services.   They also use various\n\nlogos featuring a cartoon duck and water to advertise and represent\n\ntheir businesses.\n\nB.   The Parties\n\n           Since 1994, Boston Duck has offered sightseeing tours of\n\nthe Boston area and Charles River, largely with genuine renovated\n\nDUKWs from World War II.   Andy Wilson, the founder of Boston Duck,\n\nstarted the company after a visit to Memphis, Tennessee in 1992,\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fwhere he experienced his first tour.                  The vehicles, which are\n\npainted with a rainbow of colors and marked with the Boston Duck\n\nlogo,1 take customers to a number of Boston landmarks, including\n\nCharles Street, the State House, the North End, Quincy Market, and\n\nNewbury     Street.      Boston      Duck      has     received       national     and\n\ninternational press coverage as well as numerous awards for its\n\ntours.    The tours were featured in the World Series Parade after\n\nthe Boston Red Sox won the World Series in 2004 and after the\n\nPatriots' 2002, 2004, and 2005 Super Bowl wins.                      In 2006 alone,\n\nover 585,000 customers enjoyed a tour operated by Boston Duck.\n\n            Begun in 2001, Super Duck is also in the business of\n\nproviding sightseeing tours by land and water.                  Rather than using\n\nrenovated DUKWs, Super Duck uses custom-made amphibious vehicles\n\ncalled Hydra-Terras containing several features that make the\n\nvessels   virtually     unsinkable.          Because     of    the    Hydra-Terras'\n\nfeatures,    which    make   them    \"larger    and     more    modern\"    than   the\n\noriginal DUKW vehicles, Super Duck decided to adopt the trade name\n\nSUPER DUCK TOURS in 2001.           The name and the company's super-hero\n\ntheme seek to portray services that are \"bigger and newer\"; the\n\ncompany essentially combined the word \"super\" with the description\n\nof the service offered, \"duck tours.\"                The \"super\" theme was also\n\nreflected    in   the   company's     advertisements          and    website,    which\n\n\n\n     1\n       See Appendix for an image of the logo.         A detailed\ndescription of the logo is provided in Section V, infra.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fcontain a parody of Superman (\"It's a bus.       It's a boat.   It's a\n\nSuper Duck!\") as well as its logo, which consists of a white\n\ncartoon duck with an orange bill, muscular arms, and a cape.\n\n          Super Duck opened its business in Portland, Maine in 2001\n\nand operated exclusively there until 2003, when the company ceased\n\nits operations in Maine and, seeking a larger New England market,\n\nstarted planning operations in Boston.          Unable to obtain the\n\nnecessary approvals and Hackney licenses to begin operations on its\n\nown, Super Duck purchased New England Tours in 2006 and thereafter\n\nobtained the necessary permits and licenses to conduct its tours.\n\nIn late 2006 and 2007, Super Duck took steps to begin its Boston\n\noperation,    including   launching   its   website,   advertising   its\n\nservices in local publications, and making substantial capital and\n\nresource investments in its operations.       In May 2007, Super Duck\n\nentered into an agreement with Discover Boston, an independent\n\ncompany that offers trolley tours, whereby Discover Boston agreed\n\nto sell tickets for Super Duck tours in exchange for a sales\n\ncommission.    Super Duck introduced its tour operations the same\n\nmonth; the tours avoid the Back Bay area, a focus of Boston Duck's\n\ntours, instead concentrating on the Boston waterfront area.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fC.   The Trademarks\n\n           Boston Duck owns several state and federal trademark\n\nregistrations for the composite2 word mark BOSTON DUCK TOURS and a\n\ncomposite design mark consisting of the company's name and logo in\n\nconnection with its sightseeing tour services.        For both of these\n\nmarks,   Boston   Duck's   federal    registrations   on   the   Principal\n\nRegister3 are subject to disclaimers for the terms \"duck\" and\n\n\"tours,\" meaning that it does not possess exclusive rights to use\n\neither term separate and apart from its full, registered mark.\n\nSee, e.g., Dena Corp. v. Belvedere Int'l, Inc., 950 F.2d 1555, 1560\n\n(Fed. Cir. 1991).     Boston Duck also owns two federal trademark\n\nregistrations, one for the composite word mark BOSTON DUCK TOURS\n\nand the second for its composite design mark, in connection with\n\n\"clothing, namely, sweatshirts, T-shirts, golf shirts, sweaters,\n\nvisors, and hats.\"4    Boston Duck claims a first-use date of 1993\n\n\n     2\n       A \"composite mark\" is a mark that consists of several\nseparate elements.   If a mark contains components that \"are so\nmerged together that they cannot be regarded as separate elements\n. . . , the mark is a single unitary mark.\" 4 Thomas McCarthy,\nMcCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 19:66 (4th ed.\n2008).\n     3\n       There are a number of procedural and substantive legal\nbenefits that come with registration of a mark on the Principal\nRegister.    See 3 McCarthy, supra, § 19:9.          For example,\n\"registration on the Principal Register is prima facie evidence of\nthe validity of the registered mark, of the registration of the\nmark, of the registrant's ownership of the mark, and of the\nregistrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark.\" Id.\n     4\n      In connection with its applications for apparel, Boston Duck\nwas required to disclaim the term \"Boston,\" but not \"duck\" or\n\n                                     -6-\n\ffor three of its four registrations; the fourth, the word mark in\n\nconnection with apparel, claims a first-use date of 1995.              Super\n\nDuck does not dispute that Boston Duck maintains trademark priority\n\nrights in the Boston area with respect to its composite marks.\n\n               Super Duck maintains one federal registration for the\n\nword mark SUPER DUCK TOURS on the Supplemental Register,5 in\n\nconnection with its tour services.            Super Duck filed for the mark\n\nin 2001 on the Principal Register, but its application was rejected\n\nby the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the \"PTO\"), which\n\nruled that the phrase was merely descriptive, and therefore not\n\nentitled to protection unless Super Duck could establish secondary\n\nmeaning.       As a result, Super Duck agreed to register the mark on\n\nthe Supplemental Register, and further, to disclaim exclusive use\n\nof the phrase \"duck tours.\"            The mark has been registered since\n\nJuly 2003, and Super Duck claims a first-use date of 2001.\n\nD.   Procedural History\n\n               On July 2, 2007, Boston Duck filed a complaint against\n\nSuper       Duck   Tours,   alleging   federal   trademark   infringement   in\n\nviolation of Section 32(1) of the Lanham Act, codified at 15 U.S.C.\n\n\n\"tours.\"\n        5\n       A mark may be registered on the Supplemental Register if it\nis inherently non-distinctive (such as a descriptive phrase), and\nis \"capable of achieving trademark status through the acquisition\nof secondary meaning and distinctiveness.\" 2 McCarthy, supra, §\n12:1. A generic term cannot be registered on either the Principal\nor Supplemental Registers. Id.\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f§ 1114, federal and state unfair competition, tortious interference\n\nwith prospective business relationships, and a flock of other state\n\nand federal claims.         In connection with these claims, Boston Duck\n\nasked the court for a temporary restraining order and preliminary\n\ninjunction to prevent Super Duck from using its trademark or logo,\n\nor any other mark confusingly similar to Boston Duck's mark BOSTON\n\nDUCK TOURS, in connection with its services. Further, it sought to\n\nenjoin Super Duck from interfering with Boston Duck's relations\n\nwith prospective customers.\n\n              After   receiving      affidavits    and     exhibits   from   both\n\nparties, the district court held a non-testimonial hearing on the\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction on July 11.                  Two days later,\n\nthe court entered its judgment, granting Boston Duck's motion in\n\npart and denying it in part.            Specifically, the court found the\n\nterm \"duck tours\" to be nongeneric for amphibious sightseeing tours\n\nin the Boston area, and therefore capable of trademark protection.\n\nThe   court    used   the    eight-part       likelihood    of   confusion   test\n\nestablished in Pignons S.A. de Mecanique de Precision v. Polaroid\n\nCorp., 657 F.2d 482, 487 (1st Cir. 1981) (the \"Pignons factors\" or\n\n\"Pignons      analysis\"),6     and    concluded     that     Boston   Duck    had\n\n\n      6\n       In Pignons, the court stated that when determining whether\na likelihood of confusion exists, a court should examine the\nfollowing factors: \"the similarity of the marks; the similarity of\nthe goods; the relationship between the parties' channels of trade;\nthe relationship between the parties' advertising; the classes of\nprospective purchasers; evidence of actual confusion; the\ndefendant's intent in adopting its mark; and the strength of the\n\n                                        -8-\n\festablished a likelihood of success on the merits of its trademark\n\ninfringement claim.        Accordingly, the court enjoined Super Duck\n\nfrom \"using the term 'duck tours' or a cartoon duck as a trademark\n\n. . . in association with its sightseeing tour service in the\n\ngreater Boston area.\"       Further, it enjoined Super Duck from using\n\nthe   term   \"duck\"   in    a   two-word   or   three-word   trademark   in\n\nconjunction with either \"Boston\" or \"tours.\"\n\n             The court denied Boston Duck's preliminary injunction\n\nrequest on the tortious interference claim, finding that the\n\ntortious conduct alleged by Boston Duck was in fact committed by\n\nDiscover Boston, an independent agency unrelated to Super Duck.\n\nFinally, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c), the court required\n\nBoston Duck to post a bond in the amount of $100,000 as security\n\nfor any costs and damages that may be incurred or suffered by Super\n\nDuck should it be determined that the injunction was improvidently\n\ngranted.\n\n             Both Boston Duck and Super Duck challenge on appeal\n\naspects of the district court's judgment.          Super Duck challenges\n\nthe district court's preliminary injunction, arguing that the court\n\nerred by not holding that the phrase \"duck tours\" and the image of\n\na cartoon duck are generic for the services both companies provide.\n\nSuper Duck further claims that because of this error, the court\n\ngave undue weight to the term \"duck tours\" and the image of a\n\n\nplaintiff's mark.\" 657 F.2d at 487.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fcartoon duck when comparing the parties' respective marks, and\n\nthereby improperly found a likelihood of confusion between the\n\nmarks BOSTON DUCK TOURS and SUPER DUCK TOURS as well as the\n\nparties' design marks. Boston Duck cross-appeals, arguing that the\n\ndistrict court erred by not enjoining Super Duck from using the\n\nword \"duck\" or \"ducks\" in any part of its trademark in conjunction\n\nwith its services.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           When deciding a motion for a preliminary injunction, a\n\ndistrict   court    weighs    several       factors:    \"(1)      the   plaintiff's\n\nlikelihood   of    success    on    the   merits;      (2)   the    potential   for\n\nirreparable harm in the absence of an injunction; (3) whether\n\nissuing an injunction will burden the defendants less than denying\n\nan injunction would burden the plaintiffs; and (4) the effect, if\n\nany, on the public interest.\"         United States v. Weikert, 504 F.3d\n\n1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007). The first factor, the plaintiff's likelihood\n\nof success, is \"the touchstone of the preliminary injunction\n\ninquiry.\" Philip Morris, Inc. v. Harshbarger, 159 F.3d 670, 674\n\n(1st Cir. 1998). \"[I]f the moving party cannot demonstrate that he\n\nis likely to succeed in his quest, the remaining factors become\n\nmatters of idle curiosity.\" New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v.\n\nSprintCom, Inc., 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           On     appeal,    we    review    the    grant    of    a    preliminary\n\ninjunction for abuse of discretion.                 Weikert, 504 F.3d at 6.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fWithin that framework, findings of fact are reviewed for clear\n\nerror and issues of law are reviewed de novo.             Wine and Spirits\n\nRetailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 418 F.3d 36, 46 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\"[W]e will set aside a district court's ruling on a preliminary\n\ninjunction motion only if the court clearly erred in assessing the\n\nfacts, misapprehended the applicable legal principles, or otherwise\n\nis shown to have abused its discretion.\"          Id.\n\n                                    III.\n\n            Before   addressing     the    specific   arguments   raised   on\n\nappeal, we set forth as essential background some basic principles\n\nof trademark law related to the use of generic terms as marks.\n\nEven though Super Duck has acknowledged that the mark BOSTON DUCK\n\nTOURS is entitled to trademark protection, thereby conceding the\n\nfirst element of Boston Duck's trademark infringement claim, see\n\nBorinquen Biscuit Corp. v. M.V. Trading Corp., 443 F.3d 112, 116\n\n(1st Cir. 2006), we discuss these background trademark principles\n\nbecause they inform our genericism analysis of the phrase \"duck\n\ntours.\"\n\n            Although trademarks are not explicitly authorized by the\n\nUnited    States   Constitution,7    our    federal   legal   system   offers\n\n\n     7\n       By contrast, the Constitution gives Congress the express\nauthority to establish laws governing patents and copyrights. U.S.\nConst. art. I, § 8; see also 13B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.\nMiller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3582\n(2d ed. 1984) (\"The Constitution gives the Congress express power\nto enact patent and copyright laws, while the Congress must rely on\nits general power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce in\n\n                                    -11-\n\fstatutory protection for entities that adopt and use trademarks to\n\nadvertise and market their goods and services.8                 See generally 15\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1051-1129 (the Lanham Act). This protection is justified\n\nby   the    substantial        benefits     that   trademarks   offer    for   both\n\nconsumers and businesses.             Serving to distinguish and identify\n\ngoods, as well as their sources, trademarks concisely impart\n\ninformation to consumers, reducing their search costs and allowing\n\nthem to make decisions that more closely coincide with their\n\npreferences.          See Ty Inc. v. Perryman, 306 F.3d 509, 510 (7th Cir.\n\n2002) (\"The consumer who knows at a glance whose brand he is being\n\nasked      to   buy    knows   whom   to    hold   responsible    if    the    brand\n\ndisappoints and whose product to buy in the future if the brand\n\npleases.\").        Because consumers rely heavily on trademarks when\n\nmaking choices, businesses also have an incentive to maintain\n\nproduct quality, lest they lose disappointed consumers.                  See id.\n\n                The considerable reliance on trademarks by consumers also\n\ncreates an incentive for other competing, and typically less\n\nsuccessful businesses, \"to pass off their inferior brand as the\n\nsuccessful brand by adopting a confusingly similar trademark, in\n\neffect appropriating the goodwill created by the producer of the\n\n\norder to regulate trademarks.\" (footnote omitted)).\n      8\n       The term \"trademark\" is used throughout this opinion to\ninclude both trademarks and service marks. Trademarks serve to\nidentify and distinguish goods; service marks perform the same\nfunction for services.   In the context of this appeal, it is a\ndistinction without a difference.\n\n                                           -12-\n\fsuccessful brand.\"          Id.     Trademark law is designed, in part, to\n\nprevent these \"passing-off\" practices and the consumer confusion\n\nthat results from it.             See id.        Trademark infringement law is\n\nspecifically targeted to address this concern.\n\n                 To succeed on a claim of trademark infringement, a\n\nplaintiff must establish (1) that its mark is entitled to trademark\n\nprotection, and (2) that the allegedly infringing use is likely to\n\ncause consumer confusion.           Borinquen Biscuit, 443 F.3d at 116.           We\n\nhave       interpreted    \"likely    confusion\"      to    mean   \"more   than   the\n\ntheoretical possibility of confusion.\"               Int'l Ass'n of Machinists\n\nand Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO v. Winship Green Nursing Ctr., 103\n\nF.3d 196, 200 (1st Cir. 1996).               In other words, the allegedly\n\ninfringing conduct must create \"a likelihood of confounding an\n\nappreciable number of reasonably prudent purchasers exercising\n\nordinary care.\"          Id. at 201.\n\n                 A mark is entitled to trademark protection if it is\n\ncapable of functioning as a source-identifier of goods. Two Pesos,\n\nInc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 769 (1992).

Accordingly,           suggestive,\n\narbitrary, and fanciful terms may be registered as trademarks on\n\nthe Principal Register under the Lanham Act without producing any\n\nactual evidence of their source-identifying attributes or the\n\npublic's perception of these marks.\n\n             Descriptive marks are those that \"convey[] an immediate\n\nidea of the ingredients, qualities or characteristics of the goods\"\n\nto   which    they   are     attached,      see   Equine        Techs.,    Inc.   v.\n\nEquitechnology, Inc., 68 F.3d 542, 544 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting\n\nBlinded Veterans Ass'n v. Blinded Am. Veterans Found., 872 F.2d\n\n1035, 1040 (D.C. Cir. 1989), such as SPORTS ILLUSTRATED for a\n\nsports magazine.       Because descriptive marks are not inherently\n\ncapable of serving as source-identifiers, such marks may only be\n\nregistered on the Principal Register after the owner has provided\n\nsufficient     evidence to establish that the public associates the\n\nterm or phrase not only with a specific feature or quality, but\n\nalso with a single commercial source.              See 2 McCarthy, supra, §\n\n15:1.   When a descriptive phrase becomes associated with a single\n\ncommercial     source,     the     phrase    is   said     to     have     \"acquired\n\ndistinctiveness\" or \"secondary meaning,\" and therefore functions as\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fa trademark.      See 15 U.S.C. § 1052(f) (\"[N]othing [herein] shall\n\nprevent the registration of a mark used by the applicant which has\n\nbecome distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce.\").               For\n\nexample, when the public perceives the phrase SPORTS ILLUSTRATED as\n\na particular sports magazine in addition to its primary meaning as\n\na description of a specific feature or element, the phrase has\n\n\"acquired distinctiveness\" or \"secondary meaning\" and may receive\n\ntrademark      protection.      \"A   mark   is,     therefore,      considered\n\ndistinctive (and, thus, eligible for trademark protection) if it\n\neither    is     inherently     distinctive       or     exhibits    acquired\n\ndistinctiveness     gained    through   secondary      meaning.\"    Borinquen\n\nBiscuit, 443 F.3d at 116-17.\n\n            Finally, a generic term, such as \"car\" or \"pizza,\" is one\n\nthat does not have capacity as a source-identifier because it\n\ndesignates the class, or \"genus\" of goods.

(quoting 2\n\nMcCarthy, supra, § 12:1).\n\n            Because they serve primarily to describe products rather\n\nthan   identify    their   sources,     generic    terms   are        incapable   of\n\nbecoming trademarks, at least in connection with the products that\n\nthey designate.     See Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc.,\n\n469 U.S. 189, 193-94 (1985). Awarding trademark rights to any user\n\nof the term, especially the first user, would harm competitors and\n\nconsumers alike.        Competitors unable to use a common term that\n\ndescribes    or   designates    their    product    are    at     a    significant\n\ndisadvantage communicating to potential customers the nature and\n\ncharacteristics of the product.

L. Rev. 147, 154 (2007). Likewise, consumers will\n\nbe forced either to pay a higher price to purchase the desired\n\ngoods from the seller who owns the generic term as a trademark or\n\nexpend   additional     time   investigating      the   alternative         products\n\navailable.        Id.      Therefore,     in   accord      with       the   primary\n\njustifications for protecting trademarks -- to aid competition and\n\nlower consumers' search costs -- the law does not grant any party\n\nexclusive rights to use generic terms as trademarks.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f          We turn now to Super Duck's several challenges to the\n\nconclusions of the district court.\n\n                                IV.\n\n          We begin with Boston Duck's trademark infringement claim\n\nagainst Super Duck based on the parties' word marks.    On appeal,\n\nSuper Duck challenges the district court's conclusion that Super\n\nDuck's use of   its mark SUPER DUCK TOURS is likely to cause\n\nconfusion among the relevant consumer public with Boston Duck's use\n\nof its mark BOSTON DUCK TOURS.13   Specifically, it argues that the\n\ncourt erred by finding that the phrase \"duck tours\" is nongeneric\n\nfor amphibious sightseeing tours and therefore capable of receiving\n\ntrademark protection.   Because of this erroneous conclusion, Super\n\nDuck asserts that the district court gave undue weight to the\n\nphrase \"duck tours\" in the parties' respective marks when analyzing\n\nthe relevant Pignons factors. For example, rather than focusing on\n\nthe nongeneric portions of each party's mark, \"BOSTON\" and \"SUPER,\"\n\nrespectively, when comparing the marks, the court treated each\n\nelement in the parties' composite marks equally when comparing them\n\nwith one another.   If the district court had deemed \"duck tours\"\n\ngeneric as the law requires, Super Duck contends, it would have de-\n\nemphasized that element in each party's mark and found that the\n\n\n\n     13\n        The district court properly noted that Super Duck had\nconceded the first required element in Boston Duck's trademark\ninfringement action -- that it owns a mark entitled to trademark\nprotection. See Borinquen Biscuit, 443 F.3d at 116.\n\n                               -18-\n\fdifferences between the composite marks significantly outweighed\n\nthe similarities.   Further, the court's analysis of other Pignons\n\nfactors, including Super Duck's intent in adopting its mark and the\n\nconsideration of evidence of actual confusion, would also have been\n\naltered in favor of Super Duck.        As a result, the district court\n\nwould not have found a likelihood of confusion between the marks\n\nand granted an injunction in favor of Boston Duck.\n\nA.   The Eight-Factor Pignons Test\n\n           To determine whether the district court's conclusion\n\nregarding the second infringement requirement -- a likelihood of\n\nconfusion between the marks -- was clearly erroneous, we must\n\nassess the district court's Pignons analysis of the composite marks\n\nBOSTON DUCK TOURS and SUPER DUCK TOURS.           We review the district\n\ncourt's factual findings for each Pignons factor for clear error.\n\nSee Equine Techs., 68 F.3d at 546.          Then we assess whether the\n\ncourt's overall conclusion -- that Boston Duck was able to show a\n\nlikelihood of confusion between the marks -- is erroneous.               \"The\n\ndetermination as to whether a likelihood of confusion exists is a\n\nquestion of fact, which we review only for clear error.\"           Id.\n\n           Where the district court's analysis is based on an\n\nincorrect legal premise, or it has not addressed a relevant and\n\nrequired issue, we could remand the case to the district court for\n\nfurther   consideration   in   light   of   the   legal   errors   we    have\n\nidentified.    However, where the underlying facts are largely\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fundisputed, as they are in this case, we think that course of\n\naction would be a waste of judicial resources and incompatible with\n\nthe urgency of the issues before us.               See Guglietti v. Sec'y of\n\nHealth & Human Servs. 900 F.2d 397, 399-400 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(choosing not to remand where the facts were not in dispute and the\n\ndistrict court was in no better position to decide the matter); Kos\n\nPharm., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 712 (3rd Cir. 2004)\n\n(noting that it would be a waste of judicial resources to remand a\n\ntrademark action where the district court committed legal error,\n\nbut   the   facts   necessary   to   make    the    necessary   likelihood     of\n\nconfusion determination are undisputed); Opticians Ass'n of Am. v.\n\nIndep. Opticians of Am., 920 F.2d 187, 194-98 (3d Cir. 1990)\n\n(addressing    the    remaining      elements      necessary    to   support    a\n\npreliminary injunction without remand where the district court had\n\nerroneously found that plaintiff was unlikely to succeed on the\n\nmerits of its claim).     Where the district court's analysis reveals\n\na legal error, we address those conclusions de novo.                    On the\n\nremaining factors -- the similarity of the goods, the relationship\n\nbetween the parties' channels of trade, the relationship between\n\nthe parties' advertising, and the classes of prospective purchasers\n\n–- we defer to the district court's analysis.\n\n            1. Strength of the Plaintiff's Mark\n\n            Although the eight-factor Pignons analysis typically\n\nbegins with an evaluation of the similarities and differences\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fbetween the marks at issue, there is no necessary sequence in the\n\neight-factor analysis.       In this case, Super Duck has asserted that\n\nan element of Boston Duck's mark, \"duck tours,\" is generic.               This\n\ngenericism challenge implicates the strength of Boston Duck's mark.\n\nMoreover, for the reasons asserted by Super Duck, if the district\n\ncourt's   conclusion    on    the    genericism    question     was     clearly\n\nerroneous, the court's analysis of several other Pignons factors\n\nwas necessarily flawed as well. Thus, we begin our discussion with\n\nthe district court's evaluation of the phrase \"duck tours\" and,\n\nconsequently,   its    analysis     of   the   strength   of   Boston   Duck's\n\ncomposite trademark BOSTON DUCK TOURS.\n\n                  a. The district court's genericism analysis\n\n          Evaluating the strength of Boston Duck's composite mark,\n\nthe district court limited its discussion exclusively to the phrase\n\n\"duck tours,\" assessing both the phrase's conceptual strength --\n\nits inherent distinctiveness -- and its commercial strength.14              The\n\ncourt found the phrase \"duck tours\" was nongeneric.              In reaching\n\nthis conclusion, the court relied exclusively on a dictionary\n\n\n     14\n        The \"conceptual strength\" of a mark refers to the mark's\nplacement on the spectrum of distinctiveness.           \"Commercial\nstrength\" denotes the mark's consumer recognition value in the\nmarketplace. 2 McCarthy, supra, § 11:83. As we explain in greater\ndetail below, we typically evaluate a mark's strength primarily on\nthe basis of its commercial strength, analyzing such factors as\n\"the length of time a mark has been used and the relative renown in\nits field; the strength of the mark in plaintiff's field of\nbusiness; and the plaintiff's action in promoting the mark.\"\nEquine Techs., 68 F.3d at 547 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fdefinition of \"duck,\" which did not include any reference to DUKWs\n\nor amphibious vehicles.        See    2 McCarthy, supra, § 12:13 (listing\n\n\"dictionary definitions\" as one of several factors a court should\n\nconsider when determining whether a phrase is generic).                     The\n\ncourt's    analysis     of    the    genericism    issue   consisted   of   the\n\nfollowing:\n\n     Unlike the examples of \"wool felt\" and \"crab house\"\n     identified by the defendant, \"duck tours\" does not\n     clearly refer to a broad, general category of services.\n     Rather, the word \"duck\" is a play on the World WAR II\n     amphibious vehicles, DUKWs, which were the distinctive\n     predecessors of the vehicles used by Plaintiff, Boston\n     Duck Tours. The tour itself does not involve ducks, as\n     creatures, in any way. Contrary to what the name \"duck\n     tours\" may imply, the tour does not involve either duck\n     watching or duck hunting. Thus, unlike \"wool felt\" or\n     \"crab house\" in which the generic terms referred exactly\n     to what the public would assume the words to mean, the\n     link here is more attenuated.\n\nAlthough     it   did   not    classify    \"duck    tours\"   as   descriptive,\n\nsuggestive, or fanciful, it concluded that the phrase was capable\n\nof receiving trademark protection.15\n\n\n     15\n       We agree with the concurrence that the district court erred\nby assessing whether the phrase \"duck tours\" was a trademark owned\nby Boston Duck in light of Boston Duck's assertion that it only\nsought to establish a likelihood of confusion between SUPER DUCK\nTOURS and its composite mark BOSTON DUCK TOURS.       However, the\ndistrict court's underlying conclusion that the phrase \"duck tours\"\nwas not generic and therefore capable of protection as a trademark\nremains relevant for determining the scope of protection to which\nBoston Duck's composite mark was entitled and therefore whether\nSuper Duck's use of its own mark SUPER DUCK TOURS was likely to\ncause confusion with Boston Duck's mark. Thus, contrary to the\nconcurrence's suggestion, we are not conflating the likelihood of\nconfusion analysis with the first element of the infringement\nanalysis -- whether a mark is entitled to protection.        We are\nundertaking the genericism analysis only to determine the scope of\n\n                                       -22-\n\f            The district court was correct in analyzing both the\n\nconceptual and commercial strength of plaintiff's mark in this\n\ncase.16    Although we have tended to focus our strength analysis on\n\n\"practical     matters   [related      to     a    mark's     perception     in    the\n\nmarketplace]    and   not   the    legal      classification      of   the    mark,\"\n\nAttrezzi, LLC v. Maytag Corp. 436 F.3d 32, 40 (1st Cir. 2006); see\n\nBeacon Mut. Ins. Co. v. OneBeacon Ins. Group, 376 F.3d 8, 19 (1st\n\nCir. 2004), even going so far as to say that consideration of the\n\ninherent    distinctiveness       of   a    mark   was   \"a    proposition        [not]\n\nsupported by any First Circuit case law and its logic is not\n\napparent to us,\" Attrezzi, 436 F.3d at 40, the conceptual strength\n\nof the overall mark, and its components, is indeed relevant where\n\na composite mark contains an arguably generic phrase.17                If we were\n\n\nprotection afforded to Boston Duck's composite mark.\n     16\n        Without examining the specific commercial factors we\ntypically rely upon, the district court indirectly considered the\ncommercial strength of plaintiff's mark by assessing whether the\nmark had acquired secondary meaning in connection with Boston\nDuck's services. See 2 McCarthy, supra, § 11:82 (\"When determining\nthe commercial or marketplace strength of a mark, the courts look\nto the same kind of evidence of real world recognition of the mark\nas is used to decide the presence or absence of secondary meaning\nto determine whether a noninherently distinctive designation is or\nis not a valid mark.\"). Although the district court cited evidence\nof secondary meaning in connection with its analysis of the phrase\n\"duck tours\" alone, the evidence applies equally to Boston Duck's\ncomposite mark BOSTON DUCK TOURS.\n     17\n       We disagree with the concurring opinion when it states that\n\"where a mark is classified on the spectrum of distinctiveness is\nnot evidence of the choices and decision-making that a consumer\nfaces in the marketplace.\" In fact, where a mark lies on the\nspectrum of distinctiveness is in part dependent on market and\n\n                                       -23-\n\fto measure BOSTON DUCK TOURS' strength only on the basis of\n\npractical, commercial factors, we would risk affording greater\n\nprotection to the mark than is warranted.        Specifically, we would\n\nrisk recognizing commercial strength that is the result of the\n\ndescriptive   force   of   the   unprotectable   generic   element   \"duck\n\ntours.\"18 See Colt Def., 486 F.3d at 705 (\"Generic terms, being the\n\nleast distinctive, receive no trademark protection.\").          For this\n\nreason, our statement in Attrezzi, where we determined the strength\n\nof a protectable, unitary mark, does not apply to this case.19\n\n\n\n\nsocietal conditions. Words do not exist in a vacuum. They have\ndefinitions, associations, and connotations, all of which\ncontribute to the conceptual strength analysis because they reflect\nhow consumers view the words in the marketplace. For example, \"ice\ncream\" and \"pizza\" are generic terms because consumers perceive\nthem as specific goods and do not associate them with a particular\nbrand. This reality is reflected by the factors we use to evaluate\ngenericism, including the use of the term in the industry and by\nthe media, consumer surveys, and dictionary definitions, which are\nthemselves a product of market and societal forces.\n     18\n         In Attrezzi we were faced with evaluating the strength of\na protectable mark consisting of a single element -- ATTREZZI -- in\nthe face of a claim that the mark was inherently weak only because\nit was suggestive of the relevant goods rather than arbitrary. See\nAttrezzi, 436 F.3d at 40.     In rejecting the defendant Maytag's\nargument that the court rely exclusively on the mark's conceptual\nstrength in that case, we stated that a mark's conceptual strength,\nor inherent distinctiveness, is irrelevant when making such\nstrength determinations. Id.\n     19\n       Genericism was the focus of the parties' arguments below and\non appeal. We think that focus was appropriate. We respectfully\ndisagree with the concurrence's reading of Attrezzi that would\nforeclose in all cases any consideration of genericism when\nevaluating the strength of a mark, composite or otherwise, as part\nof the likelihood of confusion analysis.\n\n                                   -24-\n\f                        b. Is the phrase \"duck tours\" generic?\n\n            To assess the district court's conclusion on the strength\n\nof plaintiff's mark BOSTON DUCK TOURS, we must begin our analysis\n\nwith a discussion of whether the phrase \"duck tours\" is generic in\n\nconnection with the services offered by the parties.20                 See Am.\n\nCyanamid Corp. v. Connaught Labs., Inc., 800 F.2d 306, 308 (2d Cir.\n\n1986) (noting that for the same reasons that trademark law does not\n\ngrant protection to generic words or phrases, it also does not\n\nextend protection to a generic component of a trademark). Although\n\nthe presence of a generic term or phrase in a full mark, such as\n\n\"pizza\"    in   DOMINO'S    PIZZA,   will   not   \"render   the    entire   mark\n\ninvalid,    its   presence    does   affect   the   analysis   of    whether   a\n\ncompetitor's mark containing the same component is likely to create\n\nconfusion.\"       Id.     As noted above, a generic term is one whose\n\n\"primary significance . . . to the relevant public\" is as an\n\nidentifier of the nature of a good, rather than its source.

Brewing Co., 9\n\nF.3d 175, 180 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            Recognizing the deference owed to the district court and\n\nthe inherent time pressures a court faces when deciding complex\n\nmatters   at     the   preliminary       injunction      phase,    we    nevertheless\n\nconclude that the court committed clear error by finding that the\n\nphrase \"duck tours\" is nongeneric.                In undertaking its analysis,\n\nthe district court did not identify and apply the appropriate legal\n\nstandard in this case.         As a result, its factual conclusion on the\n\ngenericism question was erroneous.\n\n                                    i. The Legal Standard\n\n            In    undertaking       the    genericism        analysis,        the    court\n\noverlooked relevant evidence in the record on the genericism\n\nquestion.      Tasked with determining the \"primary significance\" of\n\nthe phrase at issue \"to the relevant public,\" the law instructs\n\ncourts to consider several factors when undertaking this analysis:\n\n(1)   consumer     surveys;        (2)    the    use    of   the     term      in    media\n\npublications, (3) use of the term by competitors in the industry,\n\n(4)   purchaser        testimony     concerning        the   term;      and    (5)     the\n\nplaintiff's      use    of   the   term.        Colt   Def.,   486      F.3d    at   705.\n\nNevertheless, as noted above, the court relied exclusively on one\n\ndictionary definition of \"duck\" to reach the conclusion that \"duck\n\ntours\" is nongeneric.         Although the presence or absence of a word\n\n\n                                          -26-\n\fin the dictionary, and its corresponding meaning(s), is evidence of\n\nhow the public perceives a term, Surgicenters of Am., Inc. v. Med.\n\nDental Surgeries, Co., 601 F.2d 1011, 1015 n.11 (9th Cir. 1979)\n\n(\"While not determinative, dictionary definitions are relevant and\n\noften persuasive in determining how a term is understood by the\n\nconsuming public, the ultimate test of whether a trademark is\n\ngeneric . . . .\"), it is only one of many factors to consider.           The\n\ntouchstone     of   the   analysis     remains   the    phrase's   primary\n\nsignificance to the relevant public.\n\n             In addition, the district court focused on the separate\n\nterms \"duck\" and \"tours,\" not the entire phrase.             See Filipino\n\nYellow Pages, Inc. v. Asian Journal Publ'ns., Inc., 198 F.3d 1143,\n\n1150 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding that the genericism analysis should\n\nbe conducted by looking at an entire mark rather than dissecting it\n\ninto   its   smaller   parts).       Rather   than   analyzing   each   word\n\nseparately, thereby altering the context of the inquiry, the court\n\nshould have considered \"duck tours\" as a unified phrase. As courts\n\nhave found in related contexts, a complete phrase may signify\n\nsomething different than the sum of its parts.         See AmCan Enters.,\n\nInc. v. Renzi, 32 F.3d 233, 234 (7th Cir. 1994) (\"yellow pages\"\n\ngeneric for a business telephone directory); American Express Co.\n\nv. Mastercard Int'l. Inc., 685 F. Supp. 76, 78 (S.D.N.Y. 1988)\n\n(\"gold card\" generic for credit card services).              The district\n\ncourt's decision to focus exclusively on the individual elements of\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fthe phrase, and each word's respective dictionary definition,21\n\nremoved the inquiry from its proper context and tainted the overall\n\nanalysis.\n\n                                 ii.     Application\n\n            Because   the     district   court   misapprehended    the   legal\n\nframework governing the genericism inquiry, its ultimate factual\n\nconclusion    that    \"duck    tours\"    is   nongeneric   was    necessarily\n\nerroneous as well.     In reaching its conclusion, the district court\n\ndid not consider evidence in the record suggesting that the phrase\n\n\"duck tour\" is generic for the amphibious, sightseeing tours\n\noffered by both parties.        Specifically, the court did not consider\n\nthree types of evidence typically considered integral to the\n\ngenericism determination: uses (1) by the media and other third\n\nparties, (2) within the industry generally, and (3) by Boston Duck\n\nitself.\n\n            With respect to the first type of relevant evidence, the\n\ndistrict court overlooked articles in the media and other third-\n\nparty sources that use the phrase \"duck tours\" generically to refer\n\nto amphibious, sightseeing tours.             For example, a Boston Globe\n\narticle from 2002 notes that rather than walking around Portland,\n\n\n\n     21\n       We acknowledge that when assessing the dictionary definition\nof a phrase, it may be necessary to define the individual elements\nof the phrase and then combine those definitions to ascertain the\nmeaning of the phrase as a whole. In these circumstances, however,\nthe dictionary definition becomes less helpful for determining the\npublic significance of the entire phrase.\n\n                                       -28-\n\fMaine on foot, a visitor may use \"town trolleys, duck tours, and\n\nharbor cruises.\"    Beth Greenberg, Tattoos and Views The Best-Known\n\nArtists   Craft    Their   Designs    in    Some   of   the   Region's   Most\n\nInteresting Cities, Boston Globe, Oct. 13, 2002, at M13. Another\n\nBoston Globe article published in 1997 used the phrase generically,\n\nbut in a different context.          In asserting that the Boston mayor\n\nneeded to manage traffic issues better in the city, the author\n\nwrote: \"It is important that city government remembers that it owns\n\nthe streets.      Tour buses, ersatz trolleys, and amphibious duck\n\ntours need to have their routes and parking carefully examined.\"\n\nLawrence S. DiCara, Running Against Himself; Mayor Menino's Real\n\nRace will be to Forge a Legacy after Reelection Tuesday, Boston\n\nGlobe, Nov. 2, 1997, at C1.     These articles from Boston join many\n\nothers from around the country which use \"duck tours\" in a generic\n\nmanner.   See, e.g., Schwan's IP, LLC v. Kraft Pizza Co., 460 F.3d\n\n971, 975 (8th Cir. 2006) (discussing the relevance of newspaper\n\narticles using the phrase \"brick oven\" to name a type of pizza\n\nrather than a specific brand).\n\n           Second, the court overlooked the widespread generic use\n\nof \"duck\" and \"duck tours\" by other companies around the country\n\nthat provide the same amphibious sight-seeing services.            According\n\nto the record, there are at least 36 companies in operation today\n\nthat provide tour services in cities around the United States and\n\nthe world.   Of these 36 tours described in the record, 32 include\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fthe term \"duck\" in their company or trade name, and more than 10\n\nuse both the terms \"duck\" and \"tour(s)\" in their trade name.             Many\n\nof these companies characterize their own services generically as\n\n\"duck tours.\"    Taken together, this evidence indicates that when\n\nconsumers hear the term \"duck tours,\" they associate it primarily\n\nwith a product rather than a source.         See Colt Def., 486 F.3d at\n\n706 (\"This evidence is probative of generic use because '[t]he more\n\nmembers of the public see a term used by competitors in the field,\n\nthe less likely they will be to identify the term with one\n\nparticular producer.'\" (quoting Classic Foods Int'l Corp. v. Kettle\n\nFoods,   Inc.,   468   F.   Supp.   2d   1181,   1190   (C.D.   Cal.   2007))\n\n(alteration in original)); Schwan's IP, 460 F.3d at 975 (finding\n\ngeneric use of a term by a company's competitors is indicative of\n\npublic perception).\n\n           Finally, the district court did not consider Boston\n\nDuck's own generic use of the phrase \"duck tour,\" which provides\n\nstrong evidence against its claim that the term is primarily\n\nassociated with its company rather than the services it provides.\n\nSee Retail Servs., Inc. v. Freebies Publ'g, 364 F.3d 535, 545 (4th\n\nCir. 2004) (\"[E]vidence of the owner's generic use, in particular,\n\n'is strong evidence of genericness.'\" (quoting 2 McCarthy, supra,\n\n§ 12:13)).   On its website, the company notes that \"[c]ontrary to\n\nlocal belief, the unique idea of a [d]uck [t]our did not originate\n\nin Boston.   Duck operations have been in existence in the Midwest\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\ffor decades, and in fact, continue to thrive.        What we did,\n\nhowever, is take a unique product and improve and enhance it, while\n\nat the same time bringing it to a major metropolitan city.\"    See\n\nBoston     Duck    Tours,         http://www.bostonducktours.com/\n\ncompany_history_main.html (last visited March 31, 2008).   Although\n\nBoston Duck is quick to point out the introductory clause to its\n\nwebsite statement, which asserts that the local population believes\n\nBoston Duck is the only provider of \"duck tours,\" this speculative\n\nstatement about what the Boston population believes is largely\n\nirrelevant for purposes of our analysis.    The two sentences, and\n\nthe website more generally, are published by Boston Duck to inform\n\nconsumers in the Boston area and around the world about the\n\ncompany's history and services.   Accordingly, the site instructs\n\nthese customers that the phrase \"duck tours\" is the common phrase\n\nused to describe amphibious sightseeing tours rather than Boston\n\nDuck's product alone.\n\n          In addition, several articles submitted by Boston Duck to\n\nthe district court to establish the company's fame and recognition\n\nprovide evidence of the company's generic use of the phrase \"duck\n\ntours\" and an unwitting acknowledgment of the generic nature of the\n\nphrase.   In a Business Week article from 1998, the author states\n\nthat \"[a]t the time [when the founder of Boston Duck came up with\n\nthe idea], there were only two other Duck tours in the country.\"\n\nEdith Hill Updike, A Nice Business Built on Being Nice,    Business\n\n\n                               -31-\n\fWeek, Sept. 14, 1998, at 10.              In a similar article describing the\n\nhistory of Boston Duck in Boston Business Journal, the writer\n\nstates that \"[d]uck tours have been popular for decades in the Lake\n\nCountry of Wisconsin and in southern resort towns.\"                 Lauren John,\n\nRough Road to Amphibious Landing on the Charles, Boston Business\n\nJournal, June 30, 1995.\n\n             Indeed, all of this evidence, especially the widespread\n\nuse of \"duck\" and \"duck tours\" by companies in the industry,\n\nindicates      that      no      other    \"commonly    used\"    and     effective\n\n\"alternative[s]\"        denote     the   sightseeing   services     both    parties\n\noffer.   See A.J. Canfield Co. v. Honickman, 808 F.2d 291, 305-06\n\n(3d   Cir.     1986).         Although    alternatives   do    exist,      such   as\n\n\"amphibious tours,\" none have been widely adopted in the industry.\n\nUnlike \"duck tours,\" they fail to describe the services accurately\n\nand concisely.        See     Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co., 272 F. 505, 511\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 1921) (finding \"Aspirin\" generic in part because the\n\npublic   did    not     accept    the    alternative   names   to   describe      the\n\nproduct); Ty Inc. v. Softbelly's, Inc., 353 F.3d 528, 532 (7th Cir.\n\n2003) (\"[B]ecause 'beanies' is so much shorter and punchier than\n\nthe alternatives that have emerged so far for designating the\n\nproduct, such as 'plush beanbag animals,' Ty may be fighting a\n\nlosing war to keep its 'Beanies' trademark from becoming 'beanies'\n\na generic term.\").          Because of the lack of adequate alternatives,\n\n\"duck tours\" -- the most common and accepted term to describe the\n\n\n\n                                          -32-\n\fservices at issue -- may not be appropriated for one party's\n\nexclusive use.     To grant Boston Duck exclusive rights to use the\n\nphrase in the Boston area would be to erect a barrier of entry into\n\nthe marketplace, thereby preventing other entities, such as Super\n\nDuck, from calling their product by its name.                 Super Duck, as well\n\nas other potential competitors, would be placed at a significant\n\nmarket disadvantage.          See Devan R. Desai & Sandra L. Rierson,\n\nConfronting the Genericism Conundrum, 28 Cardozo L. Rev. 1789, 1851\n\n(2007).\n\n                                     iii. Boston Duck's Counter-Arguments\n\n             Seeking    to    convince    us    that    the     district   court's\n\nnongenericism determination was not clearly erroneous, Boston Duck\n\nraises a raft of arguments in support of its position that \"duck\n\ntours\" is nongeneric.          Boston Duck asserts that the significant\n\nevidence of actual confusion by consumers in the marketplace\n\nbetween the marks BOSTON DUCK TOURS and SUPER DUCK TOURS indicates\n\nthat   the     phrase    \"duck        tour\"    possesses      source-identifying\n\nattributes.    Confusion could not arise, Boston Duck argues, unless\n\nconsumers    associate       \"duck    tours\"   with    Boston    Duck's    services\n\nspecifically. Second, Boston Duck argues that the numerous records\n\nshowing that the PTO has processed trademark applications for\n\nservices     similar    to    those    provided   by    both     parties   without\n\nrequiring a disclaimer of the term \"duck\" or the phrase \"duck tour\"\n\nsuggest that the terms are neither generic nor descriptive. Third,\n\n\n\n                                        -33-\n\fBoston Duck claims that Super Duck should not be permitted to claim\n\nthat \"duck tours\" is generic now given its previous stance before\n\nthe PTO that neither the term \"duck\" nor the phrase \"super duck\n\ntours\" was generic or descriptive.       Finally, Boston Duck argues\n\nthat the dictionary definitions indicate that \"duck\" is nongeneric.\n\nWe address each argument in turn.\n\n                                   (a) Consumer Confusion\n\n           Although   the   documentation   provided   by    Boston   Duck\n\nestablishes numerous instances of consumer confusion between the\n\nservices provided by the parties, the confusion alone suggests\n\nlittle about whether the term \"duck tours\" is generic.                The\n\nconfusion that Boston Duck cites can easily be attributed to Boston\n\nDuck's status as the exclusive purveyor of amphibious tours in the\n\nBoston area for over a decade rather than the source-identifying\n\nattributes of the phrase \"duck tours.\"      Although trademark law is\n\ndesigned   to   prevent     consumer   confusion   between    inherently\n\ndistinctive marks or descriptive marks that have acquired secondary\n\nmeaning, it is not intended to prevent confusion between two\n\nsimilar, generic marks, see Blinded Veterans Ass'n v. Blinded Am.\n\nVeterans Found., 872 F.2d 1035, 1043-45 (D.C. Cir. 1989), or,\n\nrelatedly, between marks when one mark has acquired a \"de facto\n\nsecondary meaning\" through its exclusive use of a generic term that\n\ncauses customers to associate the term with that specific source,\n\nsee Am. Online, Inc. v. AT & T Corp., 243 F.3d 812, 822 (4th Cir.\n\n\n\n                                  -34-\n\f2001) (\"[T]he repeated use of ordinary words functioning within the\n\nheartland of their ordinary meaning, and not distinctively, cannot\n\ngive   AOL   a   proprietary   right    over   those   words,     even   if   an\n\nassociation develops between the words and AOL.\"); 1 McCarthy,\n\nsupra,   §   7:66.    Boston   Duck's    evidence   of   actual    confusion,\n\ntherefore, has little probative value on the question of whether the\n\nphrase \"duck tours\" is generic.\n\n                                       (b) PTO Treatment\n\n             Boston Duck overstates the weight a court must give to the\n\ndecisions of the PTO regarding disclaimers.              Although the PTO\n\nExamining Attorney is obligated to consider whether a disclaimer is\n\nappropriate for each application reviewed, the decision remains a\n\ndiscretionary choice rather than a conclusive legal determination.\n\nSee In re Creative Goldsmiths of Wash., Inc., 229 U.S.P.Q. 766, 768\n\n(T.T.A.B. 1986) (\"[W]e conclude that it is within the discretion of\n\nan Examining Attorney to require the disclaimer of an unregistrable\n\ncomponent (such as a common descriptive, or generic, name) of a\n\ncomposite mark sought to be registered on the Principal Register\n\nunder the provisions of Section 2(f).\"); see also Trademark Manual\n\nof Examining Procedure, § 1213(a)-(c) (5th ed. 2007).              Therefore,\n\na decision by the PTO to either require a disclaimer or not is\n\nmerely a single piece of evidence in the court's overall genericism\n\nanalysis.     See In re Nat'l Data Corp., 753 F.2d 1056, 1059 (Fed.\n\nCir. 1985) (\"The power of the PTO to accept or require disclaimers\n\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\fis discretionary under the statute, and its practice over the years\n\nhas been far from consistent. Thus, it is inappropriate to give the\n\npresence   or   absence   of   a   disclaimer   any   legal   significance.\"\n\n(internal citation omitted)).\n\n           Moreover, although Boston Duck invokes several relevant\n\ntrademark applications where no disclaimer of \"duck\" or \"duck tours\"\n\nwas required, other applications include such disclaimers.              For\n\nexample, an entity named Liberty Duck Tours, LLC22 maintains several\n\npending applications for the phrase LIBERTY DUCK TOURS that disclaim\n\nexclusive use of the phrase \"duck tours.\"23       Further, because \"[t]he\n\ncrucial date for the determination of genericness is the date on\n\nwhich the alleged infringer entered the market with the disputed\n\nmark or term,\" Yellow Cab Co. of Sacramento v. Yellow Cab of Elk\n\nGrove, Inc., 419 F.3d 925, 928 (9th Cir. 2005) -- here, late 2006\n\nand early 2007 -- the evidence put forward by Boston Duck of the\n\nPTO's past treatment of applications has only limited relevance to\n\nthe district court's inquiry.         The PTO's most recent decision on\n\nthis issue is its treatment of the applications for LIBERTY DUCK\n\n     22\n       Liberty Duck Tours, LLC has not yet commenced use of its\nmark in connection with duck tours or other products.       The\napplications were filed on an intent-to-use basis without any\nfirst-use date provided. See 15 U.S.C. § 1051(b).\n     23\n       Although Liberty Duck Tours decided to disclaim the phrase\n\"duck tour\" in each of its trademark applications for LIBERTY DUCK\nTOUR, the PTO informed the company that it need not maintain the\ndisclaimer for its application in connection with clothing items.\nNevertheless, the PTO did not give Liberty Duck Tour the same\noption to remove the disclaimer from its application for LIBERTY\nDUCK TOURS in connection with sightseeing tour services.\n\n                                     -36-\n\fTOURS, which were considered by the PTO only last year, and which,\n\nat least in connection with the sightseeing services at issue in\n\nthis case, contain a disclaimer for the phrase \"duck tours.\"\n\n                                     (c) Estoppel\n\n           Super Duck is not foreclosed from arguing now that the\n\nterm \"duck\" or the phrase \"duck tours\" is generic because it argued\n\nto the contrary several years ago in front of the PTO.                 That\n\ncontrary argument is simply another factor in the evidentiary mix.\n\nSee Keebler, 624 F.2d at 375 n.7 (allowing the defendant to argue\n\nin an infringement action that plaintiff's mark was generic despite\n\na previous attempt to register the mark under the Puerto Rico\n\ntrademark statute); Am. Rice, Inc. v. H.I.T. Corp., 231 U.S.P.Q.\n\n793, 798 (T.T.A.B. 1986) (\"It is clear that while these earlier\n\npositions [of the party] may be considered as evidence, no equitable\n\nestoppel   may be derived from earlier inconsistent positions.\"\n\n(internal citations omitted)).\n\n                                     (d) Dictionary Definitions\n\n           As already noted, the dictionary definitions in the record\n\nare not conclusive on the question of public perception.             Boston\n\nDuck   offered   the   definitions   of   \"duck\"    from   several   common\n\ndictionaries, none of which includes a reference to amphibious World\n\nWar II vehicles. Conversely, Super Duck offered a single definition\n\nof \"duck\" from the Oxford English Reference Dictionary, which states\n\nthat a duck is an \"amphibious landing-craft.\"         Because dictionary\n\n\n\n                                 -37-\n\fdefinitions      are    not   conclusive   indicators        of   overall       public\n\nperception, and the specific dictionary definitions offered by the\n\nparties in this case do not significantly favor one party over the\n\nother, this factor does not materially help Boston Duck to convince\n\nus that the district court did not commit clear error in its\n\ngenericism determination.\n\n                       c. Strength of the Composite Mark\n\n            Having concluded that the phrase \"duck tours\" is generic\n\nfor the parties' services, we remain obligated to assess the\n\nstrength    of    plaintiff's     composite         mark    BOSTON   DUCK       TOURS.\n\nEvaluating the conceptual strength first, we conclude that the mark\n\nBOSTON DUCK TOURS is highly descriptive of the services Boston Duck\n\noffers.    The mark combines \"duck tours,\" a generic phrase entitled\n\nto   no   trademark      protection   at     all,    with    \"Boston,\"      a    weak,\n\ndescriptive      term    that   deserves      minimal       protection.         Thus,\n\nconceptually, BOSTON DUCK TOURS as a composite mark is weak.\n\nHowever,    BOSTON DUCK TOURS has obtained significant secondary\n\nmeaning as a result of its continuous use in the Boston area for the\n\npast 13 years.     This secondary meaning overcomes the mark's initial\n\nweakness.    2 McCarthy, supra, § 11:80 (\"[A] descriptive mark, upon\n\nattaining secondary meaning may be protected just as if it had been\n\n'strong' and arbitrary or fanciful at its inception.\").\n\n            The evidence of secondary           meaning also supports the\n\ncommercial strength of Boston Duck's mark, which is assessed by\n\n\n\n                                      -38-\n\fexamining \"the length of time the mark has been used, the trademark\n\nholder's renown in the industry, the potency of the mark in the\n\nproduct field (as measured by the number of similar registered\n\nmarks), and the trademark holder's efforts to promote and protect\n\nthe mark,\" Borinquen Biscuit, 443 F.3d at 121; see 2 McCarthy,\n\nsupra, § 11:82 (\"When determining the commercial or marketplace\n\nstrength of a mark, the courts look to the same kind of evidence of\n\nreal world recognition of the mark as is used to decide the presence\n\nor absence of secondary meaning to determine whether a noninherently\n\ndistinctive designation is or is not a valid mark.\").\n\n          Boston   Duck   has   received   significant   national   and\n\ninternational press in connection with its services, including\n\ncoverage in U.S. Airways Attaché, W Magazine, Cosmopolitan UK, and\n\nthe Christian Science Monitor, as well as numerous awards since the\n\nmark was first used in 1994.    For example, in 1996 Boston Duck won\n\nthe Boston Magazine award for Best Tour in Boston. As the exclusive\n\npurveyor of duck tour services in the Boston area for over a decade,\n\nthe company has become well known, and its revenue and number of\n\ncustomers have grown substantially. The number of ducks used by the\n\ncompany has grown from four in 1994 to         twenty-four in 2006.\n\nMoreover, 585,000 customers enjoyed a duck tour operated by Boston\n\nDuck in 2006.   Further, although a number of other entities around\n\nthe country use the phrase \"duck tours\" in their trade names to\n\ndescribe similar services, none operate within the greater Boston\n\n\n\n                                 -39-\n\farea. Together, these facts indicate that the composite mark BOSTON\n\nDUCK TOURS is reasonably strong overall as an identifier of Boston\n\nDuck's tour services in the Boston area, although part of the mark\n\n-- \"duck tours\" -- is entitled to no trademark protection at all.\n\n            2. Similarity of the Marks\n\n            The degree of similarity between two marks -- here, BOSTON\n\nDUCK TOURS and SUPER DUCK TOURS -- is determined by analyzing their\n\nsight, sound, and meaning.          Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v.\n\nWheeler, 814 F.2d 814, 817 (1st Cir. 1987).              Although \"similarity\n\nis determined on the basis of the total effect of the designation,\n\nrather than a comparison of individual features,\" Pignons, 657 F.2d\n\nat 487; see I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co., 163 F.3d 27, 43\n\n(1st Cir. 1998), we give less weight to the generic portions of the\n\nparties' respective, composite marks.           4 McCarthy, supra, § 23:49\n\n(\"If a common portion of the two conflicting marks is a public\n\ndomain generic name, the emphasis of enquiry should be upon the\n\nconfusing similarity of the nongeneric portion, with the ultimate\n\nissue determined by the confusing similarity of the total impression\n\nof both marks.\"); see Banff, Ltd. v. Federated Dep't Stores, Inc.,\n\n841 F.2d 486, 491 (2d Cir. 1988) (finding a likelihood of confusion\n\nbetween B WEAR and BEE WEAR for womens' clothing); Am. Cyanamid, 800\n\nF.2d   at   309   (HibVAX   does    not    infringe   HIB-IMUNE    because   the\n\nnongeneric portions of each mark are sufficiently dissimilar); cf.\n\nBeacon   Mut.,    376   F.3d   at   19    (finding    similarity   between   two\n\n\n\n                                         -40-\n\fcomposite marks where the dominant elements of each mark were very\n\nsimilar).   Accordingly, we compare \"the nongeneric components of a\n\nmark . . . in the context of the overall composite mark.\"    Banff,\n\n841 F.2d at 491.24\n\n            Having mistakenly concluded that the phrase \"duck tours\"\n\nwas nongeneric, the district court placed undue emphasis on the\n\nsimilarity of that phrase in the parties' marks and concluded that\n\nthe differences between the composite marks was \"slight.\" Analyzing\n\n     24\n        Although the concurrence explicitly disavows using an\nanalytical approach that considers the inherent distinctiveness of\na composite mark's individual elements, the concurrence makes an\nimplicit genericism determination when comparing the similarity of\nthe parties' composite marks. The concurrence states: \"[T]he term\n'duck tours' is commonly understood to mean an amphibious sighting\nexcursion. . . . The overall impression, therefore, suggests a\nsimilar tour offered by different enterprises.\"        Rather than\nrelying on a genericism determination to de-emphasize the phrase\n\"duck tours\" when comparing the parties' composite marks, the\nconcurrence instead relies on the fact that the terms \"duck\" and\n\"tours\" are disclaimed in Boston Duck's trademark registration and\nthat \"duck tours\" is disclaimed in Super Duck's registration. The\nconcurrence states that \"[w]ords that were disclaimed in the course\nof trademark registration ordinarily are not the dominant part of\na composite word mark.\"      We agree with the concurrence that\ndisclaimed terms must be de-emphasized when comparing the marks at\nissue. We note, however, that the PTO requires disclaimers only\nfor generic and other unregistrable elements in a composite mark.\nSee 15 U.S.C. § 1056(a) (\"The Director [of the PTO] may require the\napplicant to disclaim an unregistrable component of a mark\notherwise registrable.\") (emphasis added); Trademark Manual of\nExamining Procedure § 1213.03(b) (\"If a mark is comprised in part\nof matter that, as applied to the goods/services, is generic or\ndoes not function as a mark, the matter must be disclaimed to\npermit registration . . . .\"). Moreover, the decision as to what\nelements must be disclaimed is made when a trademark registration\napplication is being processed, which often occurs prior to or\nimmediately after the mark is introduced into the marketplace.\nThus, the concurrence's insistence that its analysis relies\nexclusively on marketplace factors to evaluate likelihood of\nconfusion is overstated.\n\n                                -41-\n\fthe similarities ourselves with the correct genericism conclusion\n\nin mind, we focus our inquiry, albeit not exclusively, on the\n\nsimilarities and differences between the words \"Boston\" and \"Super,\"\n\nthe non-generic elements of each mark.     Allowing \"duck tours\" to\n\nlargely drop out of the analysis, we conclude that the parties'\n\nmarks are reasonably, although not completely, dissimilar. Although\n\nboth \"Boston\" and \"Super\" are two-syllable words, and they are each\n\nfollowed by a two-word generic phrase, the words look and sound\n\ncompletely different.   In addition, they have different meanings,\n\ndescribing a different feature of their products.\n\n          3. Similarity of the Goods\n\n          The district court concluded that the parties \"offer\n\nvirtually identical services: amphibious sightseeing tours of the\n\ngreater Boston area.\"   It found that although slight differences\n\nexist between the products, including their routes, the differences\n\nare negligible as compared to the overall similarities.    Super Duck\n\ndoes not challenge this conclusion, which is amply supported by the\n\nrecord.\n\n          4. Relationship Between the Parties' Channels of Trade,\n5. Relationship Between the Parties' Advertising, and 6. The\nClasses of Prospective Purchasers\n\n          After   considering   these   three   interrelated   factors\n\ntogether, see Beacon Mut., 376 F.3d at 19, the district court found\n\nsignificant   overlap between the companies' channels of trade,\n\nadvertising, and prospective consumers. Super Duck does not dispute\n\n\n\n                                -42-\n\fthat the companies are close competitors, and the court's findings\n\nare supported by the record.\n\n            7. Evidence of Actual Confusion\n\n            \"While evidence of actual confusion is 'often deemed the\n\nbest   evidence     of   possible    future     confusion,'     proof      of   actual\n\nconfusion is not essential to finding likelihood of confusion.\"\n\nBorinquen Biscuit, 443 F.3d at 120 (quoting Attrezzi, 436 F.3d at\n\n40); see Volkswagenwerk, 814 F.2d at 818.              Nevertheless, as already\n\nnoted, Boston Duck has documented in the record several dozen\n\ninstances of actual confusion involving customers who were confused\n\nby the parties or believed that they were affiliated.                  Having found\n\nthe    phrase    \"duck   tours\"     nongeneric,       the   district      court   gave\n\nconsiderable      weight   to     this   evidence      of   actual   confusion     as\n\nsupporting Boston Duck's claim of infringement.\n\n            Given our conclusion that \"duck tours\" is generic, the\n\nvalue of the evidence of actual confusion documented by Boston Duck\n\nis    diminished    substantially        for    the   likelihood     of    confusion\n\nanalysis.       As a matter of law, the confusion was largely, if not\n\nexclusively, the product of Boston Duck's lack of competition in its\n\nearly years and the use of a generic phrase to describe its product.\n\nAs such, it is not the type of confusion that warrants trademark\n\nprotection.      We therefore treat that evidence as largely irrelevant\n\nin reaching our overall determination.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -43-\n\f            8. Defendant's Intent in Adopting its Mark\n\n            Whether the defendant acted in bad faith in adopting its\n\nmark   is   another   factor    to   be   considered     in    determining   the\n\nlikelihood of consumer confusion.             Attrezzi, 436 F.3d at 40.      The\n\ndistrict court concluded that Super Duck's intent in selecting the\n\nmark SUPER DUCK TOURS was \"at least, suspect.\"                It explained this\n\nconclusion by stating that \"[Super Duck] knowingly and intentionally\n\nentered the Boston market offering a service, mark and logo nearly\n\nidentical    to   that   of   Boston    Duck    Tours,   an    established   and\n\nsuccessful enterprise.\"\n\n            The court's conclusion regarding Super Duck's intent was\n\nclear error because it was based on the erroneous premise that the\n\nmarks SUPER DUCK TOURS and BOSTON DUCK TOURS are highly similar.\n\nAs already noted in our discussion of the similarity of the marks\n\nfactor, the marks are reasonably dissimilar because the shared\n\nelement in each party's mark is the generic phrase \"duck tours.\"\n\nBecause this foundational element of the court's analysis was\n\nincorrect, its conclusion that Super Duck's intent was \"at least,\n\nsuspect\" was necessarily mistaken as well.\n\n            Super Duck adopted a name that combined a generic phrase\n\ndescribing its product with a significantly different descriptive\n\nterm. Although there are similarities between the marks, logos, and\n\nservices, and Super Duck benefitted to some degree from Boston Duck\n\nintroducing the Boston population to the duck tour product, these\n\n\n\n                                       -44-\n\feffects are natural consequences of having competition in the\n\nmarketplace.       See Nora Beverages, Inc. v. Perrier Group of Am.,\n\nInc., 269 F.3d 114, 124 (2nd Cir. 2001) (\"While intentional copying\n\ncan raise a presumption of consumer confusion, '[t]he intent to\n\ncompete by imitating the successful features of another's product\n\nis vastly different from the intent to deceive purchasers as to the\n\nsource of the product.'\" (quoting Streetwise Maps, Inc. v. Vandam,\n\nInc., 159 F.3d 739, 745 (2d Cir. 1998) (internal citation omitted)).\n\nMoreover, Super Duck created its mark and logo years before it\n\nentered the Boston market, when it began its operations in Portland,\n\nMaine.\n\nB. Conclusion on the Likelihood of Confusion Analysis\n\n            Considering all of the factors in the Pignons analysis,\n\nwe conclude that the district court's finding that Boston Duck was\n\nlikely to succeed on the merits of its trademark infringement claim\n\nis clearly erroneous. Although the companies are direct competitors\n\nbecause their products, potential customers, channels of trade, and\n\nadvertising all significantly overlap, these factors alone are\n\ninsufficient to establish a successful claim of infringement. See,\n\ne.g., Prof'l Golfers Ass'n of Am. v. Bankers Life & Cas. Co., 514\n\nF.2d 665, 669 (5th Cir. 1975) (\"[D]irect competition is not the sine\n\nqua   non   of    trademark   infringement;   rather   the   gist   of   the\n\n[trademark] action lies in the likelihood of confusion to the\n\npublic.\").       Boston Duck has failed to demonstrate bad faith on the\n\n\n                                   -45-\n\fpart of Super Duck in adopting the mark SUPER DUCK TOURS.                        Its\n\nevidence of actual trademark confusion between the parties' marks\n\nhas little probative value because the confusion shown is largely\n\nbased on Boston Duck's lack of competition in its early years and\n\neach party's use of the generic phrase \"duck tours\" in its mark.25\n\nWhere the parties are direct competitors, the most important factor\n\nin the Pignons analysis is the similarity-of-marks inquiry.                     See\n\nMcNeil Nutritionals, LLC v. Heartland Sweeteners, LLC, 511 F.3d 350,\n\n367 (3d Cir. 2007) (\"'[W]hen goods are directly competing [as is\n\nundisputed in the instant case], both precedent and common sense\n\ncounsel    that    the       similarity    of      the   marks   takes    on   great\n\nprominence.'\") (quoting A & H Sportswear, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret\n\nStores, Inc., 237 F.3d 198, 214 (3rd Cir. 2000))).                        Here, the\n\nparties' marks -- with greater emphasis placed on the words \"Boston\"\n\nand \"Super\" -- are substantially dissimilar, based on sight, sound,\n\nand meaning.       To the extent any similarity exists between the\n\ncomposite marks, that similarity is a result of each party's\n\ndecision   to     use    a    generic     phrase    to   describe   its    product.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the Pignons factors do not establish\n\na likelihood of confusion between the parties' composite word marks.\n\nThat conclusion means that Boston Duck has failed to establish a\n\n\n\n\n     25\n       We acknowledge that evidence of actual confusion is not\nrequired to succeed on an infringement action.   See Borinquen\nBiscuit, 443 F.3d at 120-21.\n\n                                          -46-\n\flikelihood of success on the merits of its trademark infringement\n\nclaim.\n\n                                 V.\n\n          We turn now to the infringement analysis of the parties'\n\ncomposite design marks.26   In reviewing Boston Duck's petition for\n\na preliminary injunction, the district court also found that Boston\n\nDuck was likely to succeed on its trademark infringement claim\n\nrelating to the parties' design marks.27    Accordingly, the court\n\nenjoined Super Duck from using, in connection with its services, any\n\ndesign that contained a cartoon duck in water.\n\nA. The Eight-Factor Pignons Test\n\n          Without evaluating each Pignons factor separately, the\n\ncourt found that the parties' design marks were \"striking[ly]\n\nsimilar[]\" and, consequently, that Super Duck's decision to choose\n\na logo \"nearly identical\" to that of Boston Duck's called into\n\nquestion its intent in      choosing its mark.    Relying on these\n\nfindings, the court found a likelihood of confusion between the\n\nparties' design marks.   We disagree with the court's analysis and\n\nconclusions.\n\n\n\n\n     26\n       See Appendix for images of the parties' respective composite\ndesign marks.\n     27\n        Super Duck did not contest that Boston Duck's composite\ndesign mark is inherently distinctive or, alternatively, that it\nhas obtained secondary meaning based on its long and continued use\nin connection with Boston Duck's services.\n\n                                -47-\n\f           Although      several    of    the   eight      factors   warranted\n\nindependent analysis directed specifically at the parties' design\n\nmarks -- including the similarity of the marks, the evidence of\n\nactual confusion, and the strength of Boston Duck's mark -- the only\n\nfactor the court considered separately was the similarity of the\n\ndesigns.   On this factor, the court limited its focus to a single\n\nelement within each mark -- the central image of a cartoon duck\n\nsplashing in water -- to the exclusion of other elements, including\n\nthe colors present in each image, the background images, the content\n\nand design of the textual elements in each mark, and their overall\n\nappearance.   In the absence of a discussion of the strength of\n\nBoston Duck's mark, the similarities between the parties' composite\n\ndesign marks, and evidence of actual confusion by the district\n\ncourt, we address these factors de novo, and then evaluate our\n\nconclusions in conjunction with the district court's findings and\n\nour own earlier discussion of the remaining Pignons factors.\n\n           1. Strength of Plaintiff's Mark\n\n           Again,   we    begin    our   analysis   with    the   strength   of\n\nplaintiff's composite design mark, including an inquiry into whether\n\nthe central element of that mark -- the image of a duck splashing\n\nin water -- is generic in connection with plaintiff's duck tour\n\nservices. As noted above, the strength determination, including the\n\nimportant genericism component, weigh heavily in our consideration\n\nof the other Pignons factors.\n\n\n\n                                     -48-\n\f                  a. Genericism\n\n           The district court did not subject Boston Duck's design\n\nto a genericism analysis in the context of assessing the strength\n\nof plaintiff's mark.     Just as a word or phrase may be classified as\n\ngeneric, so too can an image or logo that describes a category of\n\ngoods or services rather than a specific source.          See 2 McCarthy,\n\nsupra, § 12:34 (\"A mark that consists of an illustration of the\n\ngoods themselves may be 'generic,' and hence incapable of serving\n\na trademark function at all.\"); Kendall-Jackson Winery, Ltd. v. E.\n\n& J. Gallo Winery, 150 F.3d 1042, 1049 (9th Cir. 1998) (finding that\n\nan image of a grape leaf on a wine bottle was not itself a\n\nprotectable mark because it cannot serve to distinguish between\n\nbrands). Accordingly, Super Duck argued that the image of a cartoon\n\nduck in water is generic for duck tour services and therefore these\n\nimages should play a minimal role in the Pignons analysis of the\n\ndesign marks.   The district court, however, did not address this\n\nissue directly; instead, it compared the marks with the underlying\n\nassumption that all of the elements of Boston Duck's logo were\n\nnongeneric.\n\n           On appeal, Super Duck contests the district             court's\n\nimplicit   conclusion,    arguing   that   the   court   ignored   evidence\n\nestablishing that virtually every duck tour company in the country\n\nuses a cartoon duck in its logo, and many of those use a cartoon\n\nduck in conjunction with an image of water.          From this evidence,\n\n\n\n                                    -49-\n\fSuper Duck argues that the image of a cartoon duck in water merely\n\ndescribes     duck       tour   services       rather    than    a   specific     provider\n\nthereof, and the image, therefore, is generic.\n\n              Although many duck tour providers use the image of a duck\n\nin water in connection with their products, many others do not.28\n\nOther than industry use, there is no evidence in the                                   record\n\nestablishing how the consumer population perceives the image in\n\nquestion.         Therefore, we have little basis upon which to conclude\n\nthat the image of a duck in water is viewed by the public as merely\n\nsynonymous with the phrase \"duck tour,\" such that it has no source-\n\nidentifying capacity at all.              Moreover, the evidence in the record\n\nsuggests that there are effective alternatives to the image of a\n\nduck    in   water       to   identify     a    source    of     duck    tour     services.\n\nAccordingly, to grant an entity the exclusive use of such a design,\n\nthereby preventing other entities from using a design confusingly\n\nsimilar      to    it,    would   not    give    the     first    user    a   significant\n\ncompetitive advantage.            Based on these factors, we cannot conclude\n\nthat the district court clearly erred in its implicit finding that\n\nthe    design      is    nongeneric.29         See   2   McCarthy,       supra,    §    12:20\n\n       28\n       Although the record does not include the design marks for\nevery duck tour provider in the nation, it does present the design\nmarks for sixteen such providers, excluding both Boston Duck and\nSuper Duck. Of the sixteen providers, seven use the image of a\nduck in water as part of their design marks.\n       29\n       Our conclusion is limited to analyzing the district court's\nconclusion based on the evidence in the record. We need not decide\nhere whether the image of a duck in water could ever be deemed\ngeneric for duck tour services.\n\n                                           -50-\n\f(\"[T]here is only a fine line between describing [a product] and\n\nnaming [it].\").\n\n           However,    although     we   have   insufficient   evidence     to\n\nconclude that the image of a duck splashing in water is generic for\n\nduck tour services,      we do conclude that the image is highly\n\ndescriptive for the parties' services, and hence the image has weak\n\nsource-identifying attributes.       See Lawrence v. P.E. Sharpless Co.,\n\n203 F. 762 (E.D. Pa. 1913) (finding the image of a cow descriptive\n\nfor dairy products); In re Eight Ball, Inc., 217 U.S.P.Q. 1183\n\n(T.T.A.B. 1983) (finding the picture of an eight ball and a pool cue\n\nmerely   descriptive   of   billiard     parlor   services);   see   also    1\n\nMcCarthy, supra, § 7:36 (listing relevant cases). Accordingly, less\n\nweight   should   be   given   to   this   specific   similarity     in   the\n\nsimilarity-of-the-marks analysis.\n\n                   b. Strength of the Composite Mark\n\n           Examining the overall strength of plaintiff's composite\n\ndesign mark, which consists of the duck image in conjunction with\n\nother design elements and Boston Duck's trade name, we conclude that\n\nthe conceptual and commercial strength of this design mark are\n\nsimilar to that of Boston Duck's word mark BOSTON DUCK TOURS. Given\n\nits widespread recognition and continued use in the Boston area for\n\nover a decade, the composite design mark is reasonably strong,\n\ndespite the fact that it contains elements that have an inherently\n\nweak capacity as source-identifiers.\n\n\n\n                                    -51-\n\f          2.

Alpha Steel\n\nTube & Shapes, Inc., 616 F.2d 440, 444 (9th Cir. 1980)); see 4\n\nMcCarthy, supra, § 23:25 (\"Obviously, for picture and design marks\n\n(as   opposed   to     word        marks),   similarity     of    appearance   is\n\ncontrolling.\").      Even if elements of each party's mark overlap, or\n\nare visually similar, the marks as a whole may still create a\n\ndistinct commercial impression, especially if the similarities are\n\nlimited   to    generic       or     descriptive      elements.     See     McNeil\n\nNutritionals, 511 F.3d at 359 (\"[F]orceful and distinctive design\n\nfeatures should be weighed more heavily because they are more likely\n\nto impact the overall impression.\"); see also First Sav. Bank,\n\nF.S.B. v. First Bank Sys., Inc., 101 F.3d 645, 655 (10th Cir. 1996)\n\n(\"When the primary term is weakly protected to begin with, minor\n\nalterations may effectively negate any confusing similarity between\n\nthe two marks.\"). Further, the marks should be viewed \"sequentially\n\n[as if one were] in the context of the marketplace\" rather than \"in\n\na side-by-side comparison.\"            Louis Vuitton Malletier v. Dooney &\n\nBourke, Inc., 454 F.3d 108, 117 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\n          Considering the parties' respective designs as a whole,\n\nas they have been depicted in the record, including the colors used,\n\n\n\n                                        -52-\n\fthe text, and the various design elements contained therein, we\n\nconclude      that   the    parties'    design       marks   are   substantially\n\ndissimilar.      Although each contains the central image of a cartoon\n\nduck in water, the ducks are significantly different in overall\n\nappearance.      Further, the other elements depicted in conjunction\n\nwith    the   duck   are   substantially      dissimilar.      Together,   these\n\ndifferences indicate that the designs are associated with separate,\n\nunrelated sources rather than the same one.\n\n              To highlight the differences between the marks, we briefly\n\ndescribe the features of each.           Boston Duck's logo consists of a\n\npurple      background     enclosed    within    a     black-bordered   circle.\n\nEncircling the top of the background is the name BOSTON DUCK TOURS\n\nin black, in a sans-serif font.30             Finally, a yellow cartoon duck\n\nwith a camouflage hat sits in the center of the circle, flapping its\n\nwings into some water and causing the blue-and-white-tipped water\n\nto splash outside of the contained circle.\n\n              By contrast, Super Duck's logo has a blue background,\n\ndenoting water, and contains several orange elements as an accent.\n\nAt the top portion of the logo, and getting smaller across the logo\n\nto suggest motion from the left portion of the logo to the right\n\nportion, the trade name Super Duck Tours is printed in orange, in\n\n\n       30\n       A serif is an \"accretion at the end of the stems of roman\nletters.\"   A serif font -- such as Times New Roman -- contains\n\"serifs\" whereas a sans-serif font does not. Futura is a common\nsans-serif font. Phil Baines & Andrew Hastam, Type & Typography\n207 (2005).\n\n                                       -53-\n\fa serif font.   At the center of the logo is a white cartoon duck,\n\nshaped to depict an actual duck tour vehicle, and simulating the\n\nmove from land to water that a tour vehicle makes.      The duck is\n\nwearing an orange cape and holding up an orange flag with one of its\n\ntwo muscular arms.   Passengers crowd together on the deck of the\n\nduck, which has \"Super Duck Tours\" emblazoned on its side.    As the\n\nduck enters the water, white pockets of water splash into the air.\n\n          The many specific differences between the two marks\n\nreaffirm our conclusion about the central enquiry:      if consumers\n\nviewed these two marks sequentially in the marketplace, they would\n\nnot consider them substantially similar.\n\n          3. Evidence of Actual Confusion\n\n          Although the record contains evidence that customers\n\nconfused the parties' services, and perhaps their trade names, we\n\nare unable to discern any evidence of actual confusion traceable\n\nspecifically to the parties' logos.      In any event, as we noted\n\nabove, evidence of actual confusion is not necessary to succeed on\n\na trademark infringement action.   See Volkswagenwerk, 814 F.2d at\n\n818.\n\nB. Conclusion on the Likelihood of Confusion Analysis\n\n          We consider the above three factors in conjunction with\n\nour analysis of the other five Pignons factors undertaken in our\n\ndiscussion of the parties' word marks.   Because those five factors\n\nfocus on the parties themselves, or the goods and services at issue,\n\n\n                               -54-\n\frather than the marks, the analysis is identical.             See supra Part\n\nIV.A.   Four of those factors -- the similarity of the goods; the\n\nrelationship   between     the     parties'   channels   of     trade;   the\n\nrelationship between the parties' advertising; and the classes of\n\nprospective purchasers -- weigh in favor of Boston Duck.            As noted\n\nabove, so too does the strength of the mark.         However, the absence\n\nof bad faith by Super Duck weighs against a finding of infringement.\n\nAnd, most importantly, the designs' overall dissimilarity weighs\n\nstrongly   against   a   finding   of   likely   confusion.      See   McNeil\n\nNutritionals, 511 F.3d at 367 (noting that the similarity-of-the-\n\nmarks factor becomes more important where the products at issue\n\ndirectly compete with one another).              Visually, the marks are\n\nsubstantially different.      The greatest similarity between them --\n\nthe image of a cartoon duck in water -- is of minimal significance\n\nbecause of its highly descriptive nature.          Thus, we conclude that\n\nthe district court's determination that there is a likelihood of\n\nconfusion between Boston Duck's design mark and Super Duck's design\n\nmark is clearly erroneous. Again, that conclusion means that Boston\n\nDuck has failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits\n\nof its infringement claim.\n\n                                     VI.\n\n           Although we have concluded that we must reverse the\n\ndecision of the district court, we have had the luxury of time in\n\nreaching our decision in this difficult case -- a luxury that the\n\n\n\n                                    -55-\n\fdistrict court did not have.          Despite those constraints, the\n\ndistrict court issued a thoughtful opinion which allowed the parties\n\nto focus their arguments in a manner that has been helpful to us.\n\n          For the reasons stated herein, Boston Duck failed to\n\nestablish a likelihood of success on its claims of trademark\n\ninfringement.   Accordingly, the district court should not have\n\nissued a preliminary injunction against Super Duck precluding the\n\nuse of its word and design marks.31    We reverse the district court's\n\norder and remand the matter to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.       Costs are awarded in\n\nfavor of Appellant Super Duck Tours.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n                  - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n     31\n        Our conclusion that the district court's grant of an\ninjunction against Super Duck was an abuse of its discretion\nrenders moot Boston Duck's cross-appeal with respect to the\ninjunction's scope.\n\n                                -56-\n\f            DICLERICO, District Judge, concurring in the judgment.\n\nAlthough I agree that the preliminary injunction was erroneously\n\nissued and must be vacated, I respectfully disagree with the\n\nmajority’s reasoning in reaching that conclusion.             We agree on the\n\nbasic standard for determining infringement, which requires proof\n\nthat:    (1)    the asserted trademark is entitled to Lanham Act\n\nprotection, and (2) “the allegedly infringing use is likely to\n\nresult in consumer confusion.” Borinquen Biscuit, 443 F.3d at 116.\n\nWe agree that “duck tours” is a commonly used phrase that means\n\namphibious sightseeing excursions. We also agree that because “duck\n\ntours” is a commonly used phrase and is shared by both of the\n\ntrademarks at issue in this case, that phrase is insignificant in\n\ndetermining     whether   the     marks   are   likely   to   cause    consumer\n\nconfusion.\n\n            I part company with the majority, however, because the\n\nmajority separately classifies the phrase “duck tours” as a generic\n\nphrase and uses that analysis to conclude that the asserted mark,\n\nBOSTON   DUCK   TOURS,    lacks    strength,    making   consumer     confusion\n\nunlikely.     In so doing, the majority has conflated the first and\n\nsecond elements of the trademark infringement standard, which in my\n\nopinion should be treated separately. I write separately to explain\n\nmy conclusion that the preliminary injunction must be vacated.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -57-\n\f                                       I.\n\n            It is important to begin with a brief review of the\n\nprocedural history of this case and the posture in which it reached\n\nthis court.   In the district court, the parties agreed that BOSTON\n\nDUCK TOURS is a protected mark.        The district court recognized this\n\nagreement   and   held,   in   its    order   granting    the   motion    for   a\n\npreliminary   injunction,      that    “there   is   no   challenge      to   the\n\nplaintiff’s ownership of a protected mark,”           Boston Duck Tours, LP\n\nv. Super Duck Tours, LLC, 514 F. Supp. 2d 119, 124 (D. Mass. 2007).\n\nBecause the first element of the infringement claim was established,\n\nthe court was not required to consider whether BOSTON DUCK TOURS is\n\na protected mark.         Therefore, the court properly turned to a\n\nconsideration of the second infringement element, the likelihood of\n\nconsumer confusion, and reviewed the evidence under the eight\n\nPignons factors.\n\n            In support of its motion for a preliminary injunction,\n\nBoston Duck focused on the similarity of Super Duck’s mark and logo\n\nto its own, along with evidence of actual consumer confusion, to\n\nshow a likelihood of success on its infringement claim.            Super Duck\n\nresponded that Boston Duck was not likely to prove infringement,\n\nprimarily due to the weakness of its mark.           Super Duck argued that\n\npart of Boston Duck’s mark, the phrase “duck tours,” is generic and\n\nnot entitled to Lanham Act protection.           In response, Boston Duck\n\nargued that its mark, BOSTON DUCK TOURS, was protected and not\n\n\n\n                                      -58-\n\fgeneric.32    Therefore, the parties in the first instance introduced\n\nthe term “generic” into the analysis of the second element of\n\ninfringement.\n\n             “Generic”   is   a   term   of   art   used   as   part   of   the\n\nclassification analysis to determine whether a trademark is entitled\n\nto Lanham Act protection under the first element of trademark\n\ninfringement.33    If the asserted mark is entitled to protection, the\n\nsecond element of the infringement analysis focuses on whether the\n\nuse of the allegedly infringing mark is likely to cause confusion\n\nwith the protected mark.          Borinquen Biscuit, 443 F.3d at 116.\n\nFollowing the lead of the parties, the district court conflated the\n\ntwo elements of an infringement analysis.           After having stated that\n\nBoston Duck’s ownership of a protected mark, BOSTON DUCK TOURS, was\n\nnot disputed, the district court nevertheless analyzed the phrase\n\n“duck tours” to determine whether it was a “generic mark,” when it\n\nconsidered the eighth Pignons factor, the strength of the mark.\n\n             In considering the eighth factor, the court noted that it\n\nwas the cornerstone of Super Duck’s case and that Super Duck’s\n\n     32\n      When the party claiming infringement has registered its\ntrademark on the Principal Register, a presumption arises that the\nmark is entitled to Lanham Act protection. Colt, 486 F.3d at 705.\nFurther, when a mark has become incontestable, pursuant to 15\nU.S.C. § 1065, as is the case here, registration is conclusive\nevidence that the mark merits protection. Park ‘N Fly, 469 U.S.\n189, 191-192.\n     33\n      The classifications used to determine whether a mark is\nprotected range along a spectrum of distinctiveness as follows:\n“(1) generic, (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, (4) arbitrary, or\n(5) fanciful.” Colt, 486 F.3d at 705.\n\n                                    -59-\n\f“argument hinges on the theory that the phrase ‘duck tours’ is a\n\ngeneric term and thus, not protectable regardless of any actual\n\nconfusion or similarity of trademarks.   As expected, the plaintiff\n\nvigorously disagrees.”    Id. at 126.    The court then considered\n\nwhether the phrase “duck tours” was generic or whether it was\n\nprotectable under the Lanham Act and concluded: “Although the Court\n\nis not convinced that ‘duck tours’ is a very strong mark it is, at\n\nleast, not a generic mark.   The Court declines to decide at this\n\ntime whether it is descriptive, suggestive or arbitrary but even if\n\nit is a weak descriptive mark, there is persuasive evidence that it\n\nhas acquired a secondary meaning in the Boston area during the past\n\n13 years.” Id. at 127. The court concluded its analysis by finding\n\nthat “duck tours” was not generic.\n\n                                II.\n\n          In this case, however, “duck tours” is not claimed as a\n\ntrademark at all.   Boston Duck does not allege that   Super Duck is\n\ninfringing its right to the mark “duck tours.”     Cf. Ty, Inc. v.\n\nJones Group Inc., 237 F.3d 891, 897 (7th Cir. 2001); Ale House\n\nMgmt., Inc. v. Raleigh Ale House, Inc., 205 F.3d 137, 140 (4th Cir.\n\n2000); Boston Beer Co. Ltd. v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co., Inc., 9\n\nF.3d 175, 179-83 (1st Cir. 1993). Instead, Boston Duck asserts that\n\nSuper Duck is infringing its registered mark, BOSTON DUCK TOURS, and\n\nits cartoon duck logo, by using a confusingly similar mark and logo.\n\n\n\n\n                               -60-\n\f          The majority opinion analyzes the separate phrase “duck\n\ntours,” apart from the asserted mark “BOSTON DUCK TOURS,” and\n\ndetermines that the phrase “duck tours” is generic.    The question\n\nof whether a mark is generic or protected is one that is addressed\n\nin the first part of an infringement analysis.        See Borinquen\n\nBiscuit, 443 F.3d at 116.   Because the parties agreed that Boston\n\nDuck’s mark was protected, the first part of the infringement\n\nanalysis has no place in this case.     See id.   Instead, the case\n\nturns on the second element, whether there is a likelihood of\n\nconsumer confusion between Boston Duck’s mark and logo and Super\n\nDuck’s mark and logo, which is determined by applying the Pignons\n\nfactors, not by considering whether part of a mark is entitled to\n\ntrademark protection.\n\n          Furthermore, the “anti-dissection rule” instructs that\n\ncomposite trademarks, those with more than one word, are considered\n\nas a whole for purposes of determining a likelihood of consumer\n\nconfusion.   3 McCarthy § 23:41.      Therefore, when we apply the\n\nPignons factors, “we look at ‘the total effect of the designation,\n\nrather than a comparison of the individual features.’” Aktiebolaget\n\nElectrolux v. Armatron Int’l, Inc., 999 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(quoting Pignons, 657 F.2d at 487). Despite that rule, the district\n\ncourt and the majority opinion analyze the phrase “duck tours” as\n\nif it were a separately claimed mark apart from the mark as a whole.\n\nI disagree with that approach, which I believe is contrary to Boston\n\n\n\n                               -61-\n\fDuck’s claim and to an infringement analysis that is supported by\n\nthis circuit’s precedent.\n\n           In addition, Super Duck raised the question of whether\n\n“duck tours” is generic in the context of the eighth Pignons factor,\n\nthe strength of the trademark.    The parties and the district court\n\nthen treated that issue as the “cornerstone” of the preliminary\n\ninjunction analysis.     The majority follows that path and analyzes\n\nthe strength of “duck tours” in the context of the eighth Pignons\n\nfactor.\n\n           In this circuit, however, the strength of a trademark is\n\nassessed   based    on   “practical     matters   and   not    the   legal\n\nclassification of the mark.”34        Attrezzi, 436 F.3d at 40.          An\n\nargument that a mark is weak based on its legal classification\n\nbetween generic and arbitrary or fanciful “is not a proposition\n\nsupported by any First Circuit case law and its logic is not\n\napparent   to   us.”35   Id.   Although     the   majority    attempts   to\n\n     34\n      The practical matters pertinent to the strength of the mark\ninclude “the length of time a mark has been used and the relative\nrenown in its field; the strength of the mark in plaintiff’s field\nof business; and the plaintiff’s action in promoting the mark.”\nEquine Techs., Inc. v. Equitechnology, Inc., 68 F.3d 542, 547 (1st\nCir. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). The legal\nclassification of trademarks, from generic to fanciful, is used in\nthe first step of an infringement analysis, for determining whether\na mark is protected under Lanham Act. Borinquen, 443 F.3d at 116-\n17.\n     35\n      In contrast, other circuits do consider where a mark falls\non the classification spectrum for purposes of determining the\nmark’s strength. See, e.g., Am. Rice, Inc. v. Producers Rice Mill,\nInc., 518 F.3d 321, 330 (5th Cir. 2008); Aronowitz v. Health-Chem\nCorp., 513 F.3d 1229, 1239-40 (11th Cir. 2008); Banff, Ltd. v.\n\n                                 -62-\n\fdistinguish the holding in Attrezzi from the circumstances in this\n\ncase, I am not persuaded.\n\n          Other   circuits      determine    the    strength    of    a   mark    by\n\nconsidering both its “conceptual strength,” meaning where it falls\n\nalong the legal classifications of distinctiveness from generic to\n\nfanciful, and its commercial strength.             See, e.g., Ut. Lighthouse\n\nMinistry v. Found. for Apologetic Info. & Research, ___ F.3d ___,\n\n2008 WL 2204387, at *7 (10th Cir. May 29, 2008); Synergistic Int’l,\n\nLLC, v. Korman, 470 F.3d 162, 173-74 (4th Cir. 2006).                 As Attrezzi\n\nexplains, the second element of the infringement analysis, whether\n\nusing the accused mark is likely to cause consumer confusion,\n\nrequires consideration of real life, practical, marketplace evidence\n\nof the likelihood of confusion.          436 F.3d at 40.       Where a mark is\n\nclassified on the spectrum of distinctiveness is not evidence of the\n\nchoices   and   decision-making      that     a    consumer     faces     in     the\n\nmarketplace. Instead, the second element considers the actual use\n\nof the allegedly infringing mark and its likely effect on commerce.\n\nTherefore, I read Attrezzi as establishing an analytical framework\n\nthat is different from that followed in other circuits and that\n\ndistinguishes   between   the    legal     issue    of   a   mark’s   conceptual\n\nstrength and the practical issue of its commercial strength.\n\n\n\nFederated Dep’t Stores, Inc., 841 F.2d 486, 491 (2d Cir. 1988).\nBecause this circuit has rejected that analysis, we are bound by\nthat precedent in the absence of intervening circumstances that\nwould warrant a change. See, e.g., Amato v. United States, 450 F.3d\n46, 53 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                    -63-\n\f                                III.\n\n           Despite the cited differences of opinion, I reach the same\n\nresult under the following analysis.\n\nA.   Likelihood of Consumer Confusion - Pignons Factors\n\n           Trademark infringement requires proof that consumers are\n\nlikely to be confused as to the source of the product they are\n\nbuying.   I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co., 163 F.3d 27, 43 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).   The potential for confusion is measured by considering\n\nthe Pignons factors:\n\n           (1) the similarity of the marks; (2) the\n           similarity of the goods; (3) the relationship\n           between the parties’ channels of trade; (4) the\n           relationship between the parties’ advertising;\n           (5) the classes of prospective purchasers; (6)\n           evidence   of   actual   confusion;   (7)   the\n           defendant’s intent in adopting its mark; and\n           (8) the strength of the plaintiff’s mark.\n\nBorinquen, 443 F.3d at 120 (citing Pignons S.A. de Mecanique de\n\nPrecision v. Polaroid Corp., 657 F.2d 482, 487 (1st Cir. 1981)).\n\nThe eight factors provide guidance and may be given more or less\n\nweight depending on the particular circumstances of the case.\n\nBeacon Mut. Ins. Co. v. OneBeacon Ins. Group, 376 F.3d 8, 15 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n           1. Similarity of the Marks\n\n           The similarity of marks must be determined by comparing\n\nthe total effect of each mark, not their separate parts.       Astra\n\nPharm. Prods., Inc. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., 718 F.2d 1201,\n\n1205 (1st Cir. 1983).   Nevertheless, if the most dominant feature\n\n                                -64-\n\fof both marks is the same or similar, then that similarity may cause\n\nconfusion. Beacon Mut., 376 F.3d at 18. Words that were disclaimed\n\nin the course of trademark registration ordinarily are not the\n\ndominant part of a composite word mark. See 4 McCarthy § 23:42; see\n\nalso Country Floors, Inc. v. P’ship Composed of Gepner & Ford, 930\n\nF.2d 1056,    1065 (3d Cir. 1991); Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple, 747\n\nF.2d 1522, 1530 (4th Cir. 1984); Giant Brands, Inc. v. Giant Eagle,\n\nInc., 228 F. Supp. 2d 646, 653 (D. Md. 2002). In addition, a logo\n\nor additional distinguishing features used with a mark may reduce\n\nthe likelihood of confusion.     Int’l Ass’n of Machinists & Aerospace\n\nWorkers v. Winship Green Nursing Ctr., 103 F.3d 196, 203 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n             SUPER DUCK TOURS and BOSTON DUCK TOURS both include the\n\nphrase “duck tours” which makes that part of the marks identical.\n\nBoston   Duck    disclaimed   both    “duck”     and   “tours”   during   the\n\nregistration process and Super Duck disclaimed “duck tours.”              In\n\naddition, the term “duck tours” is commonly understood to mean an\n\namphibious sightseeing excursion.           Therefore, “duck tours” should\n\nnot be considered the dominant part of their marks.\n\n             Instead, the marks’ first words are their most salient\n\nfeatures. “Super” refers to the characteristics of the tour, while\n\n“Boston” suggests its geography. The overall impression, therefore,\n\nsuggests a similar tour offered by different enterprises.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -65-\n\f            The logos reinforce the differences.    Boston Duck's logo\n\nconsists of a white oval within which is a circle with a black\n\nborder framing a yellow cartoon duck. The duck sits on blue water\n\nfacing out directly from the center of the circle with a purple\n\nbackdrop.   Written around the top of the circle is the name BOSTON\n\nDUCK TOURS in uniform black lettering.       The yellow cartoon duck\n\nwears a camouflage hat and is flapping its wings into water, causing\n\nthe blue-and-white-tipped water to splash outside of the circle.\n\n            Super Duck's logo is a blue oval with darker blue accents,\n\ndenoting water.     Toward the top of the logo, and getting smaller\n\nacross the logo to suggest motion from left to right, the trade name\n\nSUPER DUCK TOURS is printed in orange.     “SUPER” is the largest and\n\nmost prominent feature of the mark as used in the logo.        At the\n\ncenter of the logo is a duck tour vehicle with a cartoon duck head\n\nand wings on the front and a duck tail on the rear of the vehicle.\n\nThe duck vehicle with its wheels depicted is moving from a black\n\nroad into the water.    On the front of the vehicle are the head and\n\nshoulders of a cartoon duck with an orange cape flowing behind and\n\nover the vehicle.    With one of its two muscular wings, the duck is\n\nholding up an orange flag    with the words “Charlestown, MA” on it.\n\nPassengers crowd together along the side of the duck vehicle, which\n\nhas \"Super Duck Tours\" written on its side.        As the duck vehicle\n\nenters the water, white water splashes into the air.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -66-\n\f          Although both logos show cartoon ducks, the ducks are used\n\ndifferently.     Super Duck’s logo emphasizes its super hero theme and\n\nits new vehicle, while Boston Duck’s logo focuses on the duck’s head\n\nwith a camouflage hat, a reference to the World War II vehicles used\n\nby Boston Duck. The obvious differences between the marks and logos\n\nstrengthen the conclusion that they are not confusingly similar.\n\nIf consumers viewed the marks and logos in the marketplace, without\n\nprior exposure to only Boston Duck’s mark and logo, they would not\n\nbe confused.\n\n          2. Similarity of Services\n\n          The tour services offered by Boston Duck and Super Duck\n\nare similar, and the district court found them to be virtually\n\nidentical.   Super Duck does not challenge that part of the district\n\ncourt’s order.\n\n          3. Channels of Trade, Advertising, and Customers\n\n          The third, fourth, and fifth Pignons factors are often\n\nconsidered together.     Attrezzi, 436 F.3d at 39.    The parties do not\n\ndispute   that    they   share   channels   of   trade,   customers,   and\n\nadvertising.\n\n          4.     Actual Confusion\n\n          Evidence that consumers are actually confused by similar\n\nmarks provides the best proof of the likelihood of future confusion.\n\nId. at 40. Evidence of actual confusion, however, may be the result\n\nof external factors unrelated to the similarity of the marks.\n\n\n\n                                    -67-\n\fAnheuser-Busch, Inc. v. L & L Wings, Inc., 962 F.2d 316, 320 (4th\n\nCir. 1992). While trademarks are intended to protect against unfair\n\ncompetition, they are not intended to perpetuate product monopolies.\n\nId.\n\n           Boston Duck provided evidence that some consumers were\n\nconfused when Super Duck began operations in Boston in the summer\n\nof 2007.   Some consumers would buy tickets for Super Duck tours and\n\nthen arrive at Boston Duck’s departure sites for tours.    Taken in\n\nthe proper context, however, the confusion that has occurred between\n\nSuper Duck and Boston Duck during the first few weeks of Super\n\nDuck’s operations in the Boston area was more likely caused by\n\nBoston’s Duck unique position during the thirteen years that it\n\noperated the only amphibious tour service in the Boston area.36   As\n\na result, Boston Duck has enjoyed a monopoly in that segment of the\n\ntour service industry in the Boston area.   In contrast, if several\n\namphibious tour services had been operating in the Boston area when\n\nSuper Duck began operations, a duck tour would be less likely to be\n\nassociated with a single company.37\n\n           Trademark laws, however, cannot be used to perpetuate a\n\nproduct monopoly if the competing trademarks are not otherwise\n\nconfusingly similar.    Because I conclude that Boston Duck’s and\n\n      36\n      The record also suggests that confusion may have been\nexacerbated by the company Super Duck hired to sell its tickets.\n      37\n      For example, consumers would not confuse “Boston Pizza” with\n“Super Pizza” because they expect a variety of pizza businesses to\nco-exist.\n\n                                -68-\n\fSuper Duck’s marks and logos are not confusingly similar, I am\n\nunpersuaded by the evidence of actual confusion.\n\n             5. Intent\n\n             Whether the defendant acted in bad faith in adopting its\n\nmark   is   another       factor   to   be   considered   in   determining     the\n\nlikelihood of consumer confusion.                 Attrezzi, 436 F.3d at 40.\n\nEvidence that the defendant intended to take advantage of the\n\nplaintiff’s reputation, goodwill, and promotion of its product by\n\nadopting a similar mark is probative of the likelihood of consumer\n\nconfusion. Star Fin. Servs., Inc. v. AASTAR Mortgage Corp., 89 F.3d\n\n5, 11 (1st Cir. 1996).         Evidence of the defendant’s good faith in\n\nadopting its mark, however, does not show that consumer confusion\n\nis unlikely.        Id.\n\n             Boston Duck argues that Super Duck intended to trade off\n\nof Boston Duck’s goodwill by using SUPER DUCK TOURS as its mark.\n\nIn support of that theory, Boston Duck contends that Super Duck was\n\naware of Boston Duck’s trademark, its logo, and its associated\n\nreputation when it moved its operations from Portland, Maine to\n\nBoston.     Those    circumstances,      Boston   Duck    asserts,   support   an\n\ninference of Super Duck’s bad faith.\n\n             The evidence shows, however, that Super Duck adopted its\n\nmark when it began operating in Portland six years before it moved\n\nto Boston.     Boston Duck does not contend that use of the mark in\n\n\n\n\n                                        -69-\n\fPortland infringed its trademark. The circumstances here do not\n\nsupport an inference of bad faith.\n\n           6. Strength of the Mark\n\n           The last Pignons factor evaluates the relative strength\n\nof the marks based on practical considerations.   Attrezzi, 436 F.3d\n\nat 40.   Strength is measured by considering “the length of time the\n\nmark has been used, the trademark holder’s renown in the industry,\n\nthe potency of the mark in the product field (as measured by the\n\nnumber of similar registered marks), and the trademark holder’s\n\nefforts to promote and protect the mark.” Borinquen, 443 F.3d at\n\n121.\n\n           The evidence shows that Boston Duck Tours has used its\n\ntrademark and logo since 1994.     Super Duck began to use its mark\n\nseven years later, in 2001, in Portland, Maine. The first duck tour\n\napparently began in Wisconsin just after World War II. Indeed,\n\nBoston Duck acknowledges on its website that it is not the first or\n\nthe only duck tour. Therefore, although Boston Duck has more\n\nlongevity than Super Duck, Boston Duck was not the first duck tour\n\nnor is it apparently the longest running duck tour in the industry.\n\n           Boston Duck demonstrates that it is renowned in the Boston\n\narea for its sightseeing tours.   Its fame is due at least in part,\n\nhowever, to the position it has enjoyed as the only duck tour\n\nservice in the Boston area. Boston Duck’s recognition in tour\n\nmagazines and the awards it cites are focused on its unique Boston\n\n\n\n                                 -70-\n\fservice.   As such, the evidence does not show that Boston Duck has\n\nunusual renown in the    industry as a whole, when compared to\n\namphibious tours offered elsewhere.\n\n           The record evidence shows that many other amphibious\n\nvehicle sightseeing companies, outside of Boston, provide the same\n\nservice, use the term “duck” or “duck tour” in their names or in\n\ndescribing their services, and show a cartoon duck in their logos.38\n\nEven Boston Duck’s means of conveyance, the World War II DUKWs, is\n\nnot unique. The record also shows that other duck tour companies\n\nhave applied to register names with the term “duck tours,” including\n\nSuper Duck, and that other trademarks which include the term “duck\n\ntours” have been registered with the PTO.\n\n           Boston Duck protected its mark by registering its word\n\nmark and its logo with the PTO in 2002. Boston Duck represents that\n\nits declarations for use and incontestibility of the mark were\n\naccepted by the PTO in July of 2007.   In its registration, however,\n\nBoston Duck disclaimed the right to use the word “duck” and the word\n\n“tours” apart from its mark, BOSTON DUCK TOURS.   Boston Duck states\n\n\n\n\n     38\n      In fact, this is not the first dispute about similar services\nthat has landed a duck tour company in court. See, e.g., Ride the\nDucks of Phil. LLC v. Duck Boat Tours, Inc., 2005 WL 1583514 (3d\nCir. July 6, 2005); City of Key West v. Duck Tours Seafari, Inc.,\n972 So. 2d 901 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2007); Dells Boat Co., Inc. v.\nVillage of Lake Delton, 2001 WL 1512763 (Wis. Ct. App. Nov. 29,\n2001); Old South Duck Tours, Inc. v. Mayor & Aldermen of Savannah,\n535 S.E.2d 751 (S.C. 2000).\n\n\n                               -71-\n\fthat it promotes its mark and logo by using them on its website, on\n\nits ticket sales booths, and on the tour vehicles.\n\n            Despite Boston Duck’s recognition in the Boston tour\n\nindustry and its registration and promotion of its mark and logo,\n\ngiven the common use of the term “duck tours” to describe the\n\nservice Boston Duck provides, BOSTON DUCK TOURS is not a strong\n\nmark.\n\n            7.   Weighing the Pignons Factors\n\n            Although several of the pertinent factors for determining\n\nwhether Boston Duck has shown a likelihood of consumer confusion\n\nbetween its mark and logo and Super Duck’s mark and logo are\n\nconceded,    those   that   are   contested,    when   viewed   under   the\n\nappropriate standard, weigh strongly against finding a likelihood\n\nof consumer confusion.      Boston Duck Tours is not a strong mark,\n\nparticularly because its reputation is built at least in part on\n\nhaving introduced the amphibious tour service to Boston and having\n\nbeen the only such tour in Boston for thirteen years.           Duck tours,\n\nhowever, have been and continue to be available in other cities in\n\nthis country and internationally.\n\n            Despite their shared use of the phrase “duck tours,” the\n\noverall impression of the Boston Duck and Super Duck marks and logos\n\nis that they are not similar.             Although Boston Duck provided\n\nevidence of actual consumer confusion, such confusion is likely more\n\nthe result of Boston Duck’s unique position in Boston rather than\n\n\n\n                                   -72-\n\fany similarity in the marks and logos. Finally, the record does not\n\nsupport an inference that Super Duck adopted its name in bad faith\n\nto trade off of Boston Duck’s reputation.   In sum, Boston Duck has\n\nnot shown that it is likely to succeed on its infringement claim by\n\nshowing a likelihood of consumer confusion between the marks and\n\nlogos.\n\nB.   Injunction\n\n           Therefore, Boston Duck was not entitled to the injunction\n\nthat was issued.

In this trademark infringement\n\ndispute,   defendant-appellant        Super    Duck   Tours   (\"Super   Duck\")\n\nappeals a preliminary injunction granted in favor of plaintiff-\n\nappellee Boston Duck Tours (\"Boston Duck\").               Asserting that the\n\nphrase \"duck tour\" and the image of a duck splashing in water are\n\ngeneric, and therefore that there is no likelihood of confusion\n\nbetween Boston Duck's marks and Super Duck's marks, appellant\n\nrequests that we dissolve the injunction requiring the alteration\n\nof its trade name and logo.       Appellee has also cross-appealed the\n\norder of the district court, arguing that the court committed clear\n\nerror by not enjoining Super Duck from using the term \"duck\" in its\n\ntrade name.\n\n              After carefully reviewing the record in this dispute, we\n\nconclude that the district court committed clear error by finding\n\nthe phrase \"duck tour\" nongeneric, and thereby according it too\n\nmuch weight in its likelihood of confusion analysis. Consequently,\n\nthe   court    erred   in   issuing   a     preliminary   injunction,    which\n\nprevented Super Duck from using the phrase \"duck tour\" in its own\n\ntrade name.      The district court also clearly erred in finding a\n\nlikelihood of confusion between Super Duck's and Boston Duck's\n\ndesign marks.     Therefore, the court also should not have issued an\n\ninjunction preventing Super Duck from using its design mark.               We\n\ndismiss Boston Duck's cross-appeal as moot given our resolution of\n\nthe other issues.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                                 I.\n\nA.   Duck Tours\n\n           We recite the background facts here, adding additional\n\ninformation throughout the analysis where appropriate. Both Boston\n\nDuck and Super Duck are in the business of offering sightseeing\n\ntours via land and water in Boston, using amphibious vehicles\n\ncommonly referred to as \"ducks.\"   The idea to market such tours to\n\nthe public was hatched by Melvin Flath shortly after World War II.\n\nHe purchased DUKWs (pronounced \"ducks\"), amphibious army vehicles\n\nused in the war to function as both trucks and boats, and fitted\n\nthem with bus seats.       His company, based in Wisconsin Dells,\n\nWisconsin, became the first purveyor of such tours in the country.\n\n           Recently, these amphibious tours have surfaced in many\n\ncities in the United States and abroad, including San Francisco,\n\nPhiladelphia, Seattle, Chicago, and London.    Many of the companies\n\nthat offer these tours use the phrase \"duck tour\" in their trade\n\nnames as a way of describing their services.   They also use various\n\nlogos featuring a cartoon duck and water to advertise and represent\n\ntheir businesses.\n\nB.   The Parties\n\n           Since 1994, Boston Duck has offered sightseeing tours of\n\nthe Boston area and Charles River, largely with genuine renovated\n\nDUKWs from World War II.   Andy Wilson, the founder of Boston Duck,\n\nstarted the company after a visit to Memphis, Tennessee in 1992,\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fwhere he experienced his first tour.                  The vehicles, which are\n\npainted with a rainbow of colors and marked with the Boston Duck\n\nlogo,1 take customers to a number of Boston landmarks, including\n\nCharles Street, the State House, the North End, Quincy Market, and\n\nNewbury     Street.      Boston      Duck      has     received       national     and\n\ninternational press coverage as well as numerous awards for its\n\ntours.    The tours were featured in the World Series Parade after\n\nthe Boston Red Sox won the World Series in 2004 and after the\n\nPatriots' 2002, 2004, and 2005 Super Bowl wins.                      In 2006 alone,\n\nover 585,000 customers enjoyed a tour operated by Boston Duck.\n\n            Begun in 2001, Super Duck is also in the business of\n\nproviding sightseeing tours by land and water.                  Rather than using\n\nrenovated DUKWs, Super Duck uses custom-made amphibious vehicles\n\ncalled Hydra-Terras containing several features that make the\n\nvessels   virtually     unsinkable.          Because     of    the    Hydra-Terras'\n\nfeatures,    which    make   them    \"larger    and     more    modern\"    than   the\n\noriginal DUKW vehicles, Super Duck decided to adopt the trade name\n\nSUPER DUCK TOURS in 2001.           The name and the company's super-hero\n\ntheme seek to portray services that are \"bigger and newer\"; the\n\ncompany essentially combined the word \"super\" with the description\n\nof the service offered, \"duck tours.\"                The \"super\" theme was also\n\nreflected    in   the   company's     advertisements          and    website,    which\n\n\n\n     1\n       See Appendix for an image of the logo.         A detailed\ndescription of the logo is provided in Section V, infra.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fcontain a parody of Superman (\"It's a bus.       It's a boat.   It's a\n\nSuper Duck!\") as well as its logo, which consists of a white\n\ncartoon duck with an orange bill, muscular arms, and a cape.\n\n          Super Duck opened its business in Portland, Maine in 2001\n\nand operated exclusively there until 2003, when the company ceased\n\nits operations in Maine and, seeking a larger New England market,\n\nstarted planning operations in Boston.          Unable to obtain the\n\nnecessary approvals and Hackney licenses to begin operations on its\n\nown, Super Duck purchased New England Tours in 2006 and thereafter\n\nobtained the necessary permits and licenses to conduct its tours.\n\nIn late 2006 and 2007, Super Duck took steps to begin its Boston\n\noperation,    including   launching   its   website,   advertising   its\n\nservices in local publications, and making substantial capital and\n\nresource investments in its operations.       In May 2007, Super Duck\n\nentered into an agreement with Discover Boston, an independent\n\ncompany that offers trolley tours, whereby Discover Boston agreed\n\nto sell tickets for Super Duck tours in exchange for a sales\n\ncommission.    Super Duck introduced its tour operations the same\n\nmonth; the tours avoid the Back Bay area, a focus of Boston Duck's\n\ntours, instead concentrating on the Boston waterfront area.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fC.   The Trademarks\n\n           Boston Duck owns several state and federal trademark\n\nregistrations for the composite2 word mark BOSTON DUCK TOURS and a\n\ncomposite design mark consisting of the company's name and logo in\n\nconnection with its sightseeing tour services.        For both of these\n\nmarks,   Boston   Duck's   federal    registrations   on   the   Principal\n\nRegister3 are subject to disclaimers for the terms \"duck\" and\n\n\"tours,\" meaning that it does not possess exclusive rights to use\n\neither term separate and apart from its full, registered mark.\n\nSee, e.g., Dena Corp. v. Belvedere Int'l, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573146\"><a href=\"/opinion/573146/dena-corporation-v-belvedere-international-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1560\n\n(Fed. Cir. 1991).     Boston Duck also owns two federal trademark\n\nregistrations, one for the composite word mark BOSTON DUCK TOURS\n\nand the second for its composite design mark, in connection with\n\n\"clothing, namely, sweatshirts, T-shirts, golf shirts, sweaters,\n\nvisors, and hats.\"4    Boston Duck claims a first-use date of 1993\n\n\n     2\n       A \"composite mark\" is a mark that consists of several\nseparate elements.   If a mark contains components that \"are so\nmerged together that they cannot be regarded as separate elements\n. . . , the mark is a single unitary mark.\" 4 Thomas McCarthy,\nMcCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 19:66 (4th ed.\n2008).\n     3\n       There are a number of procedural and substantive legal\nbenefits that come with registration of a mark on the Principal\nRegister.

Super Duck filed for the mark\n\nin 2001 on the Principal Register, but its application was rejected\n\nby the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the \"PTO\"), which\n\nruled that the phrase was merely descriptive, and therefore not\n\nentitled to protection unless Super Duck could establish secondary\n\nmeaning.       As a result, Super Duck agreed to register the mark on\n\nthe Supplemental Register, and further, to disclaim exclusive use\n\nof the phrase \"duck tours.\"            The mark has been registered since\n\nJuly 2003, and Super Duck claims a first-use date of 2001.\n\nD.   Procedural History\n\n               On July 2, 2007, Boston Duck filed a complaint against\n\nSuper       Duck   Tours,   alleging   federal   trademark   infringement   in\n\nviolation of Section 32(1) of the Lanham Act, codified at 15 U.S.C.\n\n\n\"tours.\"\n        5\n       A mark may be registered on the Supplemental Register if it\nis inherently non-distinctive (such as a descriptive phrase), and\nis \"capable of achieving trademark status through the acquisition\nof secondary meaning and distinctiveness.\" 2 McCarthy, supra, §\n12:1. A generic term cannot be registered on either the Principal\nor Supplemental Registers.

In connection with these claims, Boston Duck\n\nasked the court for a temporary restraining order and preliminary\n\ninjunction to prevent Super Duck from using its trademark or logo,\n\nor any other mark confusingly similar to Boston Duck's mark BOSTON\n\nDUCK TOURS, in connection with its services. Further, it sought to\n\nenjoin Super Duck from interfering with Boston Duck's relations\n\nwith prospective customers.\n\n              After   receiving      affidavits    and     exhibits   from   both\n\nparties, the district court held a non-testimonial hearing on the\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction on July 11.                  Two days later,\n\nthe court entered its judgment, granting Boston Duck's motion in\n\npart and denying it in part.            Specifically, the court found the\n\nterm \"duck tours\" to be nongeneric for amphibious sightseeing tours\n\nin the Boston area, and therefore capable of trademark protection.\n\nThe   court    used   the    eight-part       likelihood    of   confusion   test\n\nestablished in Pignons S.A. de Mecanique de Precision v.

Id.      Therefore,     in   accord      with       the   primary\n\njustifications for protecting trademarks -- to aid competition and\n\nlower consumers' search costs -- the law does not grant any party\n\nexclusive rights to use generic terms as trademarks.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f          We turn now to Super Duck's several challenges to the\n\nconclusions of the district court.\n\n                                IV.\n\n          We begin with Boston Duck's trademark infringement claim\n\nagainst Super Duck based on the parties' word marks.    On appeal,\n\nSuper Duck challenges the district court's conclusion that Super\n\nDuck's use of   its mark SUPER DUCK TOURS is likely to cause\n\nconfusion among the relevant consumer public with Boston Duck's use\n\nof its mark BOSTON DUCK TOURS.13   Specifically, it argues that the\n\ncourt erred by finding that the phrase \"duck tours\" is nongeneric\n\nfor amphibious sightseeing tours and therefore capable of receiving\n\ntrademark protection.   Because of this erroneous conclusion, Super\n\nDuck asserts that the district court gave undue weight to the\n\nphrase \"duck tours\" in the parties' respective marks when analyzing\n\nthe relevant Pignons factors. For example, rather than focusing on\n\nthe nongeneric portions of each party's mark, \"BOSTON\" and \"SUPER,\"\n\nrespectively, when comparing the marks, the court treated each\n\nelement in the parties' composite marks equally when comparing them\n\nwith one another.   If the district court had deemed \"duck tours\"\n\ngeneric as the law requires, Super Duck contends, it would have de-\n\nemphasized that element in each party's mark and found that the\n\n\n\n     13\n        The district court properly noted that Super Duck had\nconceded the first required element in Boston Duck's trademark\ninfringement action -- that it owns a mark entitled to trademark\nprotection. See Borinquen Biscuit, 443 F.3d at 116.\n\n                               -18-\n\fdifferences between the composite marks significantly outweighed\n\nthe similarities.   Further, the court's analysis of other Pignons\n\nfactors, including Super Duck's intent in adopting its mark and the\n\nconsideration of evidence of actual confusion, would also have been\n\naltered in favor of Super Duck.        As a result, the district court\n\nwould not have found a likelihood of confusion between the marks\n\nand granted an injunction in favor of Boston Duck.\n\nA.   The Eight-Factor Pignons Test\n\n           To determine whether the district court's conclusion\n\nregarding the second infringement requirement -- a likelihood of\n\nconfusion between the marks -- was clearly erroneous, we must\n\nassess the district court's Pignons analysis of the composite marks\n\nBOSTON DUCK TOURS and SUPER DUCK TOURS.           We review the district\n\ncourt's factual findings for each Pignons factor for clear error.\n\nSee Equine Techs., 68 F.3d at 546.          Then we assess whether the\n\ncourt's overall conclusion -- that Boston Duck was able to show a\n\nlikelihood of confusion between the marks -- is erroneous.               \"The\n\ndetermination as to whether a likelihood of confusion exists is a\n\nquestion of fact, which we review only for clear error.\"           Id.\n\n           Where the district court's analysis is based on an\n\nincorrect legal premise, or it has not addressed a relevant and\n\nrequired issue, we could remand the case to the district court for\n\nfurther   consideration   in   light   of   the   legal   errors   we    have\n\nidentified.    However, where the underlying facts are largely\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fundisputed, as they are in this case, we think that course of\n\naction would be a waste of judicial resources and incompatible with\n\nthe urgency of the issues before us.

Where the district court's analysis reveals\n\na legal error, we address those conclusions de novo.                    On the\n\nremaining factors -- the similarity of the goods, the relationship\n\nbetween the parties' channels of trade, the relationship between\n\nthe parties' advertising, and the classes of prospective purchasers\n\n–- we defer to the district court's analysis.\n\n            1. Strength of the Plaintiff's Mark\n\n            Although the eight-factor Pignons analysis typically\n\nbegins with an evaluation of the similarities and differences\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fbetween the marks at issue, there is no necessary sequence in the\n\neight-factor analysis.       In this case, Super Duck has asserted that\n\nan element of Boston Duck's mark, \"duck tours,\" is generic.               This\n\ngenericism challenge implicates the strength of Boston Duck's mark.\n\nMoreover, for the reasons asserted by Super Duck, if the district\n\ncourt's   conclusion    on    the    genericism    question     was     clearly\n\nerroneous, the court's analysis of several other Pignons factors\n\nwas necessarily flawed as well. Thus, we begin our discussion with\n\nthe district court's evaluation of the phrase \"duck tours\" and,\n\nconsequently,   its    analysis     of   the   strength   of   Boston   Duck's\n\ncomposite trademark BOSTON DUCK TOURS.\n\n                  a. The district court's genericism analysis\n\n          Evaluating the strength of Boston Duck's composite mark,\n\nthe district court limited its discussion exclusively to the phrase\n\n\"duck tours,\" assessing both the phrase's conceptual strength --\n\nits inherent distinctiveness -- and its commercial strength.14              The\n\ncourt found the phrase \"duck tours\" was nongeneric.              In reaching\n\nthis conclusion, the court relied exclusively on a dictionary\n\n\n     14\n        The \"conceptual strength\" of a mark refers to the mark's\nplacement on the spectrum of distinctiveness.           \"Commercial\nstrength\" denotes the mark's consumer recognition value in the\nmarketplace. 2 McCarthy, supra, § 11:83. As we explain in greater\ndetail below, we typically evaluate a mark's strength primarily on\nthe basis of its commercial strength, analyzing such factors as\n\"the length of time a mark has been used and the relative renown in\nits field; the strength of the mark in plaintiff's field of\nbusiness; and the plaintiff's action in promoting the mark.\"\nEquine Techs., 68 F.3d at 547 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fdefinition of \"duck,\" which did not include any reference to DUKWs\n\nor amphibious vehicles.        See    2 McCarthy, supra, § 12:13 (listing\n\n\"dictionary definitions\" as one of several factors a court should\n\nconsider when determining whether a phrase is generic).                     The\n\ncourt's    analysis     of    the    genericism    issue   consisted   of   the\n\nfollowing:\n\n     Unlike the examples of \"wool felt\" and \"crab house\"\n     identified by the defendant, \"duck tours\" does not\n     clearly refer to a broad, general category of services.\n     Rather, the word \"duck\" is a play on the World WAR II\n     amphibious vehicles, DUKWs, which were the distinctive\n     predecessors of the vehicles used by Plaintiff, Boston\n     Duck Tours. The tour itself does not involve ducks, as\n     creatures, in any way. Contrary to what the name \"duck\n     tours\" may imply, the tour does not involve either duck\n     watching or duck hunting. Thus, unlike \"wool felt\" or\n     \"crab house\" in which the generic terms referred exactly\n     to what the public would assume the words to mean, the\n     link here is more attenuated.\n\nAlthough     it   did   not    classify    \"duck    tours\"   as   descriptive,\n\nsuggestive, or fanciful, it concluded that the phrase was capable\n\nof receiving trademark protection.15\n\n\n     15\n       We agree with the concurrence that the district court erred\nby assessing whether the phrase \"duck tours\" was a trademark owned\nby Boston Duck in light of Boston Duck's assertion that it only\nsought to establish a likelihood of confusion between SUPER DUCK\nTOURS and its composite mark BOSTON DUCK TOURS.       However, the\ndistrict court's underlying conclusion that the phrase \"duck tours\"\nwas not generic and therefore capable of protection as a trademark\nremains relevant for determining the scope of protection to which\nBoston Duck's composite mark was entitled and therefore whether\nSuper Duck's use of its own mark SUPER DUCK TOURS was likely to\ncause confusion with Boston Duck's mark. Thus, contrary to the\nconcurrence's suggestion, we are not conflating the likelihood of\nconfusion analysis with the first element of the infringement\nanalysis -- whether a mark is entitled to protection.        We are\nundertaking the genericism analysis only to determine the scope of\n\n                                       -22-\n\f            The district court was correct in analyzing both the\n\nconceptual and commercial strength of plaintiff's mark in this\n\ncase.16    Although we have tended to focus our strength analysis on\n\n\"practical     matters   [related      to     a    mark's     perception     in    the\n\nmarketplace]    and   not   the    legal      classification      of   the    mark,\"\n\nAttrezzi, LLC v.

See 2 McCarthy, supra, § 11:82 (\"When determining\nthe commercial or marketplace strength of a mark, the courts look\nto the same kind of evidence of real world recognition of the mark\nas is used to decide the presence or absence of secondary meaning\nto determine whether a noninherently distinctive designation is or\nis not a valid mark.\"). Although the district court cited evidence\nof secondary meaning in connection with its analysis of the phrase\n\"duck tours\" alone, the evidence applies equally to Boston Duck's\ncomposite mark BOSTON DUCK TOURS.\n     17\n       We disagree with the concurring opinion when it states that\n\"where a mark is classified on the spectrum of distinctiveness is\nnot evidence of the choices and decision-making that a consumer\nfaces in the marketplace.\" In fact, where a mark lies on the\nspectrum of distinctiveness is in part dependent on market and\n\n                                       -23-\n\fto measure BOSTON DUCK TOURS' strength only on the basis of\n\npractical, commercial factors, we would risk affording greater\n\nprotection to the mark than is warranted.        Specifically, we would\n\nrisk recognizing commercial strength that is the result of the\n\ndescriptive   force   of   the   unprotectable   generic   element   \"duck\n\ntours.\"18 See Colt Def., 486 F.3d at 705 (\"Generic terms, being the\n\nleast distinctive, receive no trademark protection.\").          For this\n\nreason, our statement in Attrezzi, where we determined the strength\n\nof a protectable, unitary mark, does not apply to this case.19\n\n\n\n\nsocietal conditions. Words do not exist in a vacuum. They have\ndefinitions, associations, and connotations, all of which\ncontribute to the conceptual strength analysis because they reflect\nhow consumers view the words in the marketplace. For example, \"ice\ncream\" and \"pizza\" are generic terms because consumers perceive\nthem as specific goods and do not associate them with a particular\nbrand. This reality is reflected by the factors we use to evaluate\ngenericism, including the use of the term in the industry and by\nthe media, consumer surveys, and dictionary definitions, which are\nthemselves a product of market and societal forces.\n     18\n         In Attrezzi we were faced with evaluating the strength of\na protectable mark consisting of a single element -- ATTREZZI -- in\nthe face of a claim that the mark was inherently weak only because\nit was suggestive of the relevant goods rather than arbitrary. See\nAttrezzi, 436 F.3d at 40.     In rejecting the defendant Maytag's\nargument that the court rely exclusively on the mark's conceptual\nstrength in that case, we stated that a mark's conceptual strength,\nor inherent distinctiveness, is irrelevant when making such\nstrength determinations. Id.\n     19\n       Genericism was the focus of the parties' arguments below and\non appeal. We think that focus was appropriate. We respectfully\ndisagree with the concurrence's reading of Attrezzi that would\nforeclose in all cases any consideration of genericism when\nevaluating the strength of a mark, composite or otherwise, as part\nof the likelihood of confusion analysis.\n\n                                   -24-\n\f                        b.

Application\n\n            Because   the     district   court   misapprehended    the   legal\n\nframework governing the genericism inquiry, its ultimate factual\n\nconclusion    that    \"duck    tours\"    is   nongeneric   was    necessarily\n\nerroneous as well.     In reaching its conclusion, the district court\n\ndid not consider evidence in the record suggesting that the phrase\n\n\"duck tour\" is generic for the amphibious, sightseeing tours\n\noffered by both parties.        Specifically, the court did not consider\n\nthree types of evidence typically considered integral to the\n\ngenericism determination: uses (1) by the media and other third\n\nparties, (2) within the industry generally, and (3) by Boston Duck\n\nitself.\n\n            With respect to the first type of relevant evidence, the\n\ndistrict court overlooked articles in the media and other third-\n\nparty sources that use the phrase \"duck tours\" generically to refer\n\nto amphibious, sightseeing tours.             For example, a Boston Globe\n\narticle from 2002 notes that rather than walking around Portland,\n\n\n\n     21\n       We acknowledge that when assessing the dictionary definition\nof a phrase, it may be necessary to define the individual elements\nof the phrase and then combine those definitions to ascertain the\nmeaning of the phrase as a whole. In these circumstances, however,\nthe dictionary definition becomes less helpful for determining the\npublic significance of the entire phrase.\n\n                                       -28-\n\fMaine on foot, a visitor may use \"town trolleys, duck tours, and\n\nharbor cruises.\"    Beth Greenberg, Tattoos and Views The Best-Known\n\nArtists   Craft    Their   Designs    in    Some   of   the   Region's   Most\n\nInteresting Cities, Boston Globe, Oct. 13, 2002, at M13. Another\n\nBoston Globe article published in 1997 used the phrase generically,\n\nbut in a different context.          In asserting that the Boston mayor\n\nneeded to manage traffic issues better in the city, the author\n\nwrote: \"It is important that city government remembers that it owns\n\nthe streets.

Kraft Pizza Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795469\"><a href=\"/opinion/795469/schwans-ip-llc-schwans-consumer-brands-north-america-inc-v-kraft/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">971</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 975 (8th Cir. 2006) (discussing the relevance of newspaper\n\narticles using the phrase \"brick oven\" to name a type of pizza\n\nrather than a specific brand).\n\n           Second, the court overlooked the widespread generic use\n\nof \"duck\" and \"duck tours\" by other companies around the country\n\nthat provide the same amphibious sight-seeing services.            According\n\nto the record, there are at least 36 companies in operation today\n\nthat provide tour services in cities around the United States and\n\nthe world.   Of these 36 tours described in the record, 32 include\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fthe term \"duck\" in their company or trade name, and more than 10\n\nuse both the terms \"duck\" and \"tour(s)\" in their trade name.             Many\n\nof these companies characterize their own services generically as\n\n\"duck tours.\"    Taken together, this evidence indicates that when\n\nconsumers hear the term \"duck tours,\" they associate it primarily\n\nwith a product rather than a source.         See Colt Def., 486 F.3d at\n\n706 (\"This evidence is probative of generic use because '[t]he more\n\nmembers of the public see a term used by competitors in the field,\n\nthe less likely they will be to identify the term with one\n\nparticular producer.'\" (quoting Classic Foods Int'l Corp. v.

Although\n\nBoston Duck is quick to point out the introductory clause to its\n\nwebsite statement, which asserts that the local population believes\n\nBoston Duck is the only provider of \"duck tours,\" this speculative\n\nstatement about what the Boston population believes is largely\n\nirrelevant for purposes of our analysis.    The two sentences, and\n\nthe website more generally, are published by Boston Duck to inform\n\nconsumers in the Boston area and around the world about the\n\ncompany's history and services.   Accordingly, the site instructs\n\nthese customers that the phrase \"duck tours\" is the common phrase\n\nused to describe amphibious sightseeing tours rather than Boston\n\nDuck's product alone.\n\n          In addition, several articles submitted by Boston Duck to\n\nthe district court to establish the company's fame and recognition\n\nprovide evidence of the company's generic use of the phrase \"duck\n\ntours\" and an unwitting acknowledgment of the generic nature of the\n\nphrase.   In a Business Week article from 1998, the author states\n\nthat \"[a]t the time [when the founder of Boston Duck came up with\n\nthe idea], there were only two other Duck tours in the country.\"\n\nEdith Hill Updike, A Nice Business Built on Being Nice,    Business\n\n\n                               -31-\n\fWeek, Sept. 14, 1998, at 10.

Boston Duck's Counter-Arguments\n\n             Seeking    to    convince    us    that    the     district   court's\n\nnongenericism determination was not clearly erroneous, Boston Duck\n\nraises a raft of arguments in support of its position that \"duck\n\ntours\" is nongeneric.          Boston Duck asserts that the significant\n\nevidence of actual confusion by consumers in the marketplace\n\nbetween the marks BOSTON DUCK TOURS and SUPER DUCK TOURS indicates\n\nthat   the     phrase    \"duck        tour\"    possesses      source-identifying\n\nattributes.    Confusion could not arise, Boston Duck argues, unless\n\nconsumers    associate       \"duck    tours\"   with    Boston    Duck's    services\n\nspecifically. Second, Boston Duck argues that the numerous records\n\nshowing that the PTO has processed trademark applications for\n\nservices     similar    to    those    provided   by    both     parties   without\n\nrequiring a disclaimer of the term \"duck\" or the phrase \"duck tour\"\n\nsuggest that the terms are neither generic nor descriptive. Third,\n\n\n\n                                        -33-\n\fBoston Duck claims that Super Duck should not be permitted to claim\n\nthat \"duck tours\" is generic now given its previous stance before\n\nthe PTO that neither the term \"duck\" nor the phrase \"super duck\n\ntours\" was generic or descriptive.       Finally, Boston Duck argues\n\nthat the dictionary definitions indicate that \"duck\" is nongeneric.\n\nWe address each argument in turn.\n\n                                   (a) Consumer Confusion\n\n           Although   the   documentation   provided   by    Boston   Duck\n\nestablishes numerous instances of consumer confusion between the\n\nservices provided by the parties, the confusion alone suggests\n\nlittle about whether the term \"duck tours\" is generic.                The\n\nconfusion that Boston Duck cites can easily be attributed to Boston\n\nDuck's status as the exclusive purveyor of amphibious tours in the\n\nBoston area for over a decade rather than the source-identifying\n\nattributes of the phrase \"duck tours.\"      Although trademark law is\n\ndesigned   to   prevent     consumer   confusion   between    inherently\n\ndistinctive marks or descriptive marks that have acquired secondary\n\nmeaning, it is not intended to prevent confusion between two\n\nsimilar, generic marks, see Blinded Veterans Ass'n v.

Although the PTO\n\nExamining Attorney is obligated to consider whether a disclaimer is\n\nappropriate for each application reviewed, the decision remains a\n\ndiscretionary choice rather than a conclusive legal determination.\n\nSee In re Creative Goldsmiths of Wash., Inc., 229 U.S.P.Q. 766, 768\n\n(T.T.A.B. 1986) (\"[W]e conclude that it is within the discretion of\n\nan Examining Attorney to require the disclaimer of an unregistrable\n\ncomponent (such as a common descriptive, or generic, name) of a\n\ncomposite mark sought to be registered on the Principal Register\n\nunder the provisions of Section 2(f).\"); see also Trademark Manual\n\nof Examining Procedure, § 1213(a)-(c) (5th ed. 2007).

Boston\n\nDuck   offered   the   definitions   of   \"duck\"    from   several   common\n\ndictionaries, none of which includes a reference to amphibious World\n\nWar II vehicles. Conversely, Super Duck offered a single definition\n\nof \"duck\" from the Oxford English Reference Dictionary, which states\n\nthat a duck is an \"amphibious landing-craft.\"         Because dictionary\n\n\n\n                                 -37-\n\fdefinitions      are    not   conclusive   indicators        of   overall       public\n\nperception, and the specific dictionary definitions offered by the\n\nparties in this case do not significantly favor one party over the\n\nother, this factor does not materially help Boston Duck to convince\n\nus that the district court did not commit clear error in its\n\ngenericism determination.\n\n                       c. Strength of the Composite Mark\n\n            Having concluded that the phrase \"duck tours\" is generic\n\nfor the parties' services, we remain obligated to assess the\n\nstrength    of    plaintiff's     composite         mark    BOSTON   DUCK       TOURS.\n\nEvaluating the conceptual strength first, we conclude that the mark\n\nBOSTON DUCK TOURS is highly descriptive of the services Boston Duck\n\noffers.    The mark combines \"duck tours,\" a generic phrase entitled\n\nto   no   trademark      protection   at     all,    with    \"Boston,\"      a    weak,\n\ndescriptive      term    that   deserves      minimal       protection.         Thus,\n\nconceptually, BOSTON DUCK TOURS as a composite mark is weak.\n\nHowever,    BOSTON DUCK TOURS has obtained significant secondary\n\nmeaning as a result of its continuous use in the Boston area for the\n\npast 13 years.     This secondary meaning overcomes the mark's initial\n\nweakness.    2 McCarthy, supra, § 11:80 (\"[A] descriptive mark, upon\n\nattaining secondary meaning may be protected just as if it had been\n\n'strong' and arbitrary or fanciful at its inception.\").\n\n            The evidence of secondary           meaning also supports the\n\ncommercial strength of Boston Duck's mark, which is assessed by\n\n\n\n                                      -38-\n\fexamining \"the length of time the mark has been used, the trademark\n\nholder's renown in the industry, the potency of the mark in the\n\nproduct field (as measured by the number of similar registered\n\nmarks), and the trademark holder's efforts to promote and protect\n\nthe mark,\" Borinquen Biscuit, 443 F.3d at 121; see 2 McCarthy,\n\nsupra, § 11:82 (\"When determining the commercial or marketplace\n\nstrength of a mark, the courts look to the same kind of evidence of\n\nreal world recognition of the mark as is used to decide the presence\n\nor absence of secondary meaning to determine whether a noninherently\n\ndistinctive designation is or is not a valid mark.\").\n\n          Boston   Duck   has   received   significant   national   and\n\ninternational press in connection with its services, including\n\ncoverage in U.S. Airways Attaché, W Magazine, Cosmopolitan UK, and\n\nthe Christian Science Monitor, as well as numerous awards since the\n\nmark was first used in 1994.    For example, in 1996 Boston Duck won\n\nthe Boston Magazine award for Best Tour in Boston. As the exclusive\n\npurveyor of duck tour services in the Boston area for over a decade,\n\nthe company has become well known, and its revenue and number of\n\ncustomers have grown substantially. The number of ducks used by the\n\ncompany has grown from four in 1994 to         twenty-four in 2006.\n\nMoreover, 585,000 customers enjoyed a duck tour operated by Boston\n\nDuck in 2006.   Further, although a number of other entities around\n\nthe country use the phrase \"duck tours\" in their trade names to\n\ndescribe similar services, none operate within the greater Boston\n\n\n\n                                 -39-\n\farea. Together, these facts indicate that the composite mark BOSTON\n\nDUCK TOURS is reasonably strong overall as an identifier of Boston\n\nDuck's tour services in the Boston area, although part of the mark\n\n-- \"duck tours\" -- is entitled to no trademark protection at all.\n\n            2. Similarity of the Marks\n\n            The degree of similarity between two marks -- here, BOSTON\n\nDUCK TOURS and SUPER DUCK TOURS -- is determined by analyzing their\n\nsight, sound, and meaning.

Accordingly, we compare \"the nongeneric components of a\n\nmark . . . in the context of the overall composite mark.\"    Banff,\n\n841 F.2d at 491.24\n\n            Having mistakenly concluded that the phrase \"duck tours\"\n\nwas nongeneric, the district court placed undue emphasis on the\n\nsimilarity of that phrase in the parties' marks and concluded that\n\nthe differences between the composite marks was \"slight.\" Analyzing\n\n     24\n        Although the concurrence explicitly disavows using an\nanalytical approach that considers the inherent distinctiveness of\na composite mark's individual elements, the concurrence makes an\nimplicit genericism determination when comparing the similarity of\nthe parties' composite marks. The concurrence states: \"[T]he term\n'duck tours' is commonly understood to mean an amphibious sighting\nexcursion. . . . The overall impression, therefore, suggests a\nsimilar tour offered by different enterprises.\"        Rather than\nrelying on a genericism determination to de-emphasize the phrase\n\"duck tours\" when comparing the parties' composite marks, the\nconcurrence instead relies on the fact that the terms \"duck\" and\n\"tours\" are disclaimed in Boston Duck's trademark registration and\nthat \"duck tours\" is disclaimed in Super Duck's registration. The\nconcurrence states that \"[w]ords that were disclaimed in the course\nof trademark registration ordinarily are not the dominant part of\na composite word mark.\"      We agree with the concurrence that\ndisclaimed terms must be de-emphasized when comparing the marks at\nissue. We note, however, that the PTO requires disclaimers only\nfor generic and other unregistrable elements in a composite mark.\nSee 15 U.S.C. § 1056(a) (\"The Director [of the PTO] may require the\napplicant to disclaim an unregistrable component of a mark\notherwise registrable.\") (emphasis added); Trademark Manual of\nExamining Procedure § 1213.03(b) (\"If a mark is comprised in part\nof matter that, as applied to the goods/services, is generic or\ndoes not function as a mark, the matter must be disclaimed to\npermit registration . . . .\"). Moreover, the decision as to what\nelements must be disclaimed is made when a trademark registration\napplication is being processed, which often occurs prior to or\nimmediately after the mark is introduced into the marketplace.\nThus, the concurrence's insistence that its analysis relies\nexclusively on marketplace factors to evaluate likelihood of\nconfusion is overstated.\n\n                                -41-\n\fthe similarities ourselves with the correct genericism conclusion\n\nin mind, we focus our inquiry, albeit not exclusively, on the\n\nsimilarities and differences between the words \"Boston\" and \"Super,\"\n\nthe non-generic elements of each mark.     Allowing \"duck tours\" to\n\nlargely drop out of the analysis, we conclude that the parties'\n\nmarks are reasonably, although not completely, dissimilar. Although\n\nboth \"Boston\" and \"Super\" are two-syllable words, and they are each\n\nfollowed by a two-word generic phrase, the words look and sound\n\ncompletely different.   In addition, they have different meanings,\n\ndescribing a different feature of their products.\n\n          3. Similarity of the Goods\n\n          The district court concluded that the parties \"offer\n\nvirtually identical services: amphibious sightseeing tours of the\n\ngreater Boston area.\"   It found that although slight differences\n\nexist between the products, including their routes, the differences\n\nare negligible as compared to the overall similarities.    Super Duck\n\ndoes not challenge this conclusion, which is amply supported by the\n\nrecord.\n\n          4. Relationship Between the Parties' Channels of Trade,\n5. Relationship Between the Parties' Advertising, and 6. The\nClasses of Prospective Purchasers\n\n          After   considering   these   three   interrelated   factors\n\ntogether, see Beacon Mut., 376 F.3d at 19, the district court found\n\nsignificant   overlap between the companies' channels of trade,\n\nadvertising, and prospective consumers. Super Duck does not dispute\n\n\n\n                                -42-\n\fthat the companies are close competitors, and the court's findings\n\nare supported by the record.\n\n            7. Evidence of Actual Confusion\n\n            \"While evidence of actual confusion is 'often deemed the\n\nbest   evidence     of   possible    future     confusion,'     proof      of   actual\n\nconfusion is not essential to finding likelihood of confusion.\"\n\nBorinquen Biscuit, 443 F.3d at 120 (quoting Attrezzi, 436 F.3d at\n\n40); see Volkswagenwerk, 814 F.2d at 818.              Nevertheless, as already\n\nnoted, Boston Duck has documented in the record several dozen\n\ninstances of actual confusion involving customers who were confused\n\nby the parties or believed that they were affiliated.                  Having found\n\nthe    phrase    \"duck   tours\"     nongeneric,       the   district      court   gave\n\nconsiderable      weight   to     this   evidence      of   actual   confusion     as\n\nsupporting Boston Duck's claim of infringement.\n\n            Given our conclusion that \"duck tours\" is generic, the\n\nvalue of the evidence of actual confusion documented by Boston Duck\n\nis    diminished    substantially        for    the   likelihood     of    confusion\n\nanalysis.       As a matter of law, the confusion was largely, if not\n\nexclusively, the product of Boston Duck's lack of competition in its\n\nearly years and the use of a generic phrase to describe its product.\n\nAs such, it is not the type of confusion that warrants trademark\n\nprotection.      We therefore treat that evidence as largely irrelevant\n\nin reaching our overall determination.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -43-\n\f            8. Defendant's Intent in Adopting its Mark\n\n            Whether the defendant acted in bad faith in adopting its\n\nmark   is   another   factor    to   be   considered     in    determining   the\n\nlikelihood of consumer confusion.             Attrezzi, 436 F.3d at 40.      The\n\ndistrict court concluded that Super Duck's intent in selecting the\n\nmark SUPER DUCK TOURS was \"at least, suspect.\"                It explained this\n\nconclusion by stating that \"[Super Duck] knowingly and intentionally\n\nentered the Boston market offering a service, mark and logo nearly\n\nidentical    to   that   of   Boston    Duck    Tours,   an    established   and\n\nsuccessful enterprise.\"\n\n            The court's conclusion regarding Super Duck's intent was\n\nclear error because it was based on the erroneous premise that the\n\nmarks SUPER DUCK TOURS and BOSTON DUCK TOURS are highly similar.\n\nAs already noted in our discussion of the similarity of the marks\n\nfactor, the marks are reasonably dissimilar because the shared\n\nelement in each party's mark is the generic phrase \"duck tours.\"\n\nBecause this foundational element of the court's analysis was\n\nincorrect, its conclusion that Super Duck's intent was \"at least,\n\nsuspect\" was necessarily mistaken as well.\n\n            Super Duck adopted a name that combined a generic phrase\n\ndescribing its product with a significantly different descriptive\n\nterm. Although there are similarities between the marks, logos, and\n\nservices, and Super Duck benefitted to some degree from Boston Duck\n\nintroducing the Boston population to the duck tour product, these\n\n\n\n                                       -44-\n\feffects are natural consequences of having competition in the\n\nmarketplace.

Conclusion on the Likelihood of Confusion Analysis\n\n            Considering all of the factors in the Pignons analysis,\n\nwe conclude that the district court's finding that Boston Duck was\n\nlikely to succeed on the merits of its trademark infringement claim\n\nis clearly erroneous. Although the companies are direct competitors\n\nbecause their products, potential customers, channels of trade, and\n\nadvertising all significantly overlap, these factors alone are\n\ninsufficient to establish a successful claim of infringement.

Here, the\n\nparties' marks -- with greater emphasis placed on the words \"Boston\"\n\nand \"Super\" -- are substantially dissimilar, based on sight, sound,\n\nand meaning.       To the extent any similarity exists between the\n\ncomposite marks, that similarity is a result of each party's\n\ndecision   to     use    a    generic     phrase    to   describe   its    product.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the Pignons factors do not establish\n\na likelihood of confusion between the parties' composite word marks.\n\nThat conclusion means that Boston Duck has failed to establish a\n\n\n\n\n     25\n       We acknowledge that evidence of actual confusion is not\nrequired to succeed on an infringement action.

The Eight-Factor Pignons Test\n\n          Without evaluating each Pignons factor separately, the\n\ncourt found that the parties' design marks were \"striking[ly]\n\nsimilar[]\" and, consequently, that Super Duck's decision to choose\n\na logo \"nearly identical\" to that of Boston Duck's called into\n\nquestion its intent in      choosing its mark.    Relying on these\n\nfindings, the court found a likelihood of confusion between the\n\nparties' design marks.   We disagree with the court's analysis and\n\nconclusions.\n\n\n\n\n     26\n       See Appendix for images of the parties' respective composite\ndesign marks.\n     27\n        Super Duck did not contest that Boston Duck's composite\ndesign mark is inherently distinctive or, alternatively, that it\nhas obtained secondary meaning based on its long and continued use\nin connection with Boston Duck's services.\n\n                                -47-\n\f           Although      several    of    the   eight      factors   warranted\n\nindependent analysis directed specifically at the parties' design\n\nmarks -- including the similarity of the marks, the evidence of\n\nactual confusion, and the strength of Boston Duck's mark -- the only\n\nfactor the court considered separately was the similarity of the\n\ndesigns.   On this factor, the court limited its focus to a single\n\nelement within each mark -- the central image of a cartoon duck\n\nsplashing in water -- to the exclusion of other elements, including\n\nthe colors present in each image, the background images, the content\n\nand design of the textual elements in each mark, and their overall\n\nappearance.   In the absence of a discussion of the strength of\n\nBoston Duck's mark, the similarities between the parties' composite\n\ndesign marks, and evidence of actual confusion by the district\n\ncourt, we address these factors de novo, and then evaluate our\n\nconclusions in conjunction with the district court's findings and\n\nour own earlier discussion of the remaining Pignons factors.\n\n           1. Strength of Plaintiff's Mark\n\n           Again,   we    begin    our   analysis   with    the   strength   of\n\nplaintiff's composite design mark, including an inquiry into whether\n\nthe central element of that mark -- the image of a duck splashing\n\nin water -- is generic in connection with plaintiff's duck tour\n\nservices. As noted above, the strength determination, including the\n\nimportant genericism component, weigh heavily in our consideration\n\nof the other Pignons factors.\n\n\n\n                                     -48-\n\f                  a. Genericism\n\n           The district court did not subject Boston Duck's design\n\nto a genericism analysis in the context of assessing the strength\n\nof plaintiff's mark.     Just as a word or phrase may be classified as\n\ngeneric, so too can an image or logo that describes a category of\n\ngoods or services rather than a specific source.          See 2 McCarthy,\n\nsupra, § 12:34 (\"A mark that consists of an illustration of the\n\ngoods themselves may be 'generic,' and hence incapable of serving\n\na trademark function at all.\"); Kendall-Jackson Winery, Ltd. v. E.\n\n& J. Gallo Winery, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756554\"><a href=\"/opinion/756554/kendall-jackson-winery-limited-v-e-j-gallo-winery-a-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1042</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1049 (9th Cir. 1998) (finding that\n\nan image of a grape leaf on a wine bottle was not itself a\n\nprotectable mark because it cannot serve to distinguish between\n\nbrands). Accordingly, Super Duck argued that the image of a cartoon\n\nduck in water is generic for duck tour services and therefore these\n\nimages should play a minimal role in the Pignons analysis of the\n\ndesign marks.   The district court, however, did not address this\n\nissue directly; instead, it compared the marks with the underlying\n\nassumption that all of the elements of Boston Duck's logo were\n\nnongeneric.\n\n           On appeal, Super Duck contests the district             court's\n\nimplicit   conclusion,    arguing   that   the   court   ignored   evidence\n\nestablishing that virtually every duck tour company in the country\n\nuses a cartoon duck in its logo, and many of those use a cartoon\n\nduck in conjunction with an image of water.          From this evidence,\n\n\n\n                                    -49-\n\fSuper Duck argues that the image of a cartoon duck in water merely\n\ndescribes     duck       tour   services       rather    than    a   specific     provider\n\nthereof, and the image, therefore, is generic.\n\n              Although many duck tour providers use the image of a duck\n\nin water in connection with their products, many others do not.28\n\nOther than industry use, there is no evidence in the                                   record\n\nestablishing how the consumer population perceives the image in\n\nquestion.         Therefore, we have little basis upon which to conclude\n\nthat the image of a duck in water is viewed by the public as merely\n\nsynonymous with the phrase \"duck tour,\" such that it has no source-\n\nidentifying capacity at all.              Moreover, the evidence in the record\n\nsuggests that there are effective alternatives to the image of a\n\nduck    in   water       to   identify     a    source    of     duck    tour     services.\n\nAccordingly, to grant an entity the exclusive use of such a design,\n\nthereby preventing other entities from using a design confusingly\n\nsimilar      to    it,    would   not    give    the     first    user    a   significant\n\ncompetitive advantage.            Based on these factors, we cannot conclude\n\nthat the district court clearly erred in its implicit finding that\n\nthe    design      is    nongeneric.29         See   2   McCarthy,       supra,    §    12:20\n\n       28\n       Although the record does not include the design marks for\nevery duck tour provider in the nation, it does present the design\nmarks for sixteen such providers, excluding both Boston Duck and\nSuper Duck. Of the sixteen providers, seven use the image of a\nduck in water as part of their design marks.\n       29\n       Our conclusion is limited to analyzing the district court's\nconclusion based on the evidence in the record. We need not decide\nhere whether the image of a duck in water could ever be deemed\ngeneric for duck tour services.\n\n                                           -50-\n\f(\"[T]here is only a fine line between describing [a product] and\n\nnaming [it].\").\n\n           However,    although     we   have   insufficient   evidence     to\n\nconclude that the image of a duck splashing in water is generic for\n\nduck tour services,      we do conclude that the image is highly\n\ndescriptive for the parties' services, and hence the image has weak\n\nsource-identifying attributes.

Although each contains the central image of a cartoon\n\nduck in water, the ducks are significantly different in overall\n\nappearance.      Further, the other elements depicted in conjunction\n\nwith    the   duck   are   substantially      dissimilar.      Together,   these\n\ndifferences indicate that the designs are associated with separate,\n\nunrelated sources rather than the same one.\n\n              To highlight the differences between the marks, we briefly\n\ndescribe the features of each.           Boston Duck's logo consists of a\n\npurple      background     enclosed    within    a     black-bordered   circle.\n\nEncircling the top of the background is the name BOSTON DUCK TOURS\n\nin black, in a sans-serif font.30             Finally, a yellow cartoon duck\n\nwith a camouflage hat sits in the center of the circle, flapping its\n\nwings into some water and causing the blue-and-white-tipped water\n\nto splash outside of the contained circle.\n\n              By contrast, Super Duck's logo has a blue background,\n\ndenoting water, and contains several orange elements as an accent.\n\nAt the top portion of the logo, and getting smaller across the logo\n\nto suggest motion from the left portion of the logo to the right\n\nportion, the trade name Super Duck Tours is printed in orange, in\n\n\n       30\n       A serif is an \"accretion at the end of the stems of roman\nletters.\"   A serif font -- such as Times New Roman -- contains\n\"serifs\" whereas a sans-serif font does not. Futura is a common\nsans-serif font. Phil Baines & Andrew Hastam, Type & Typography\n207 (2005).\n\n                                       -53-\n\fa serif font.   At the center of the logo is a white cartoon duck,\n\nshaped to depict an actual duck tour vehicle, and simulating the\n\nmove from land to water that a tour vehicle makes.      The duck is\n\nwearing an orange cape and holding up an orange flag with one of its\n\ntwo muscular arms.   Passengers crowd together on the deck of the\n\nduck, which has \"Super Duck Tours\" emblazoned on its side.    As the\n\nduck enters the water, white pockets of water splash into the air.\n\n          The many specific differences between the two marks\n\nreaffirm our conclusion about the central enquiry:      if consumers\n\nviewed these two marks sequentially in the marketplace, they would\n\nnot consider them substantially similar.\n\n          3. Evidence of Actual Confusion\n\n          Although the record contains evidence that customers\n\nconfused the parties' services, and perhaps their trade names, we\n\nare unable to discern any evidence of actual confusion traceable\n\nspecifically to the parties' logos.      In any event, as we noted\n\nabove, evidence of actual confusion is not necessary to succeed on\n\na trademark infringement action.   See Volkswagenwerk, 814 F.2d at\n\n818.\n\nB. Conclusion on the Likelihood of Confusion Analysis\n\n          We consider the above three factors in conjunction with\n\nour analysis of the other five Pignons factors undertaken in our\n\ndiscussion of the parties' word marks.   Because those five factors\n\nfocus on the parties themselves, or the goods and services at issue,\n\n\n                               -54-\n\frather than the marks, the analysis is identical.             See supra Part\n\nIV.A.   Four of those factors -- the similarity of the goods; the\n\nrelationship   between     the     parties'   channels   of     trade;   the\n\nrelationship between the parties' advertising; and the classes of\n\nprospective purchasers -- weigh in favor of Boston Duck.            As noted\n\nabove, so too does the strength of the mark.         However, the absence\n\nof bad faith by Super Duck weighs against a finding of infringement.\n\nAnd, most importantly, the designs' overall dissimilarity weighs\n\nstrongly   against   a   finding   of   likely   confusion.      See   McNeil\n\nNutritionals, 511 F.3d at 367 (noting that the similarity-of-the-\n\nmarks factor becomes more important where the products at issue\n\ndirectly compete with one another).              Visually, the marks are\n\nsubstantially different.      The greatest similarity between them --\n\nthe image of a cartoon duck in water -- is of minimal significance\n\nbecause of its highly descriptive nature.          Thus, we conclude that\n\nthe district court's determination that there is a likelihood of\n\nconfusion between Boston Duck's design mark and Super Duck's design\n\nmark is clearly erroneous. Again, that conclusion means that Boston\n\nDuck has failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits\n\nof its infringement claim.\n\n                                     VI.\n\n           Although we have concluded that we must reverse the\n\ndecision of the district court, we have had the luxury of time in\n\nreaching our decision in this difficult case -- a luxury that the\n\n\n\n                                    -55-\n\fdistrict court did not have.          Despite those constraints, the\n\ndistrict court issued a thoughtful opinion which allowed the parties\n\nto focus their arguments in a manner that has been helpful to us.\n\n          For the reasons stated herein, Boston Duck failed to\n\nestablish a likelihood of success on its claims of trademark\n\ninfringement.   Accordingly, the district court should not have\n\nissued a preliminary injunction against Super Duck precluding the\n\nuse of its word and design marks.31    We reverse the district court's\n\norder and remand the matter to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.       Costs are awarded in\n\nfavor of Appellant Super Duck Tours.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n                  - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n     31\n        Our conclusion that the district court's grant of an\ninjunction against Super Duck was an abuse of its discretion\nrenders moot Boston Duck's cross-appeal with respect to the\ninjunction's scope.\n\n                                -56-\n\f            DICLERICO, District Judge, concurring in the judgment.\n\nAlthough I agree that the preliminary injunction was erroneously\n\nissued and must be vacated, I respectfully disagree with the\n\nmajority’s reasoning in reaching that conclusion.             We agree on the\n\nbasic standard for determining infringement, which requires proof\n\nthat:    (1)    the asserted trademark is entitled to Lanham Act\n\nprotection, and (2) “the allegedly infringing use is likely to\n\nresult in consumer confusion.” Borinquen Biscuit, 443 F.3d at 116.\n\nWe agree that “duck tours” is a commonly used phrase that means\n\namphibious sightseeing excursions. We also agree that because “duck\n\ntours” is a commonly used phrase and is shared by both of the\n\ntrademarks at issue in this case, that phrase is insignificant in\n\ndetermining     whether   the     marks   are   likely   to   cause    consumer\n\nconfusion.\n\n            I part company with the majority, however, because the\n\nmajority separately classifies the phrase “duck tours” as a generic\n\nphrase and uses that analysis to conclude that the asserted mark,\n\nBOSTON   DUCK   TOURS,    lacks    strength,    making   consumer     confusion\n\nunlikely.     In so doing, the majority has conflated the first and\n\nsecond elements of the trademark infringement standard, which in my\n\nopinion should be treated separately. I write separately to explain\n\nmy conclusion that the preliminary injunction must be vacated.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -57-\n\f                                       I.\n\n            It is important to begin with a brief review of the\n\nprocedural history of this case and the posture in which it reached\n\nthis court.   In the district court, the parties agreed that BOSTON\n\nDUCK TOURS is a protected mark.        The district court recognized this\n\nagreement   and   held,   in   its    order   granting    the   motion    for   a\n\npreliminary   injunction,      that    “there   is   no   challenge      to   the\n\nplaintiff’s ownership of a protected mark,”           Boston Duck Tours, LP\n\nv.

Mass. 2007).\n\nBecause the first element of the infringement claim was established,\n\nthe court was not required to consider whether BOSTON DUCK TOURS is\n\na protected mark.         Therefore, the court properly turned to a\n\nconsideration of the second infringement element, the likelihood of\n\nconsumer confusion, and reviewed the evidence under the eight\n\nPignons factors.\n\n            In support of its motion for a preliminary injunction,\n\nBoston Duck focused on the similarity of Super Duck’s mark and logo\n\nto its own, along with evidence of actual consumer confusion, to\n\nshow a likelihood of success on its infringement claim.            Super Duck\n\nresponded that Boston Duck was not likely to prove infringement,\n\nprimarily due to the weakness of its mark.           Super Duck argued that\n\npart of Boston Duck’s mark, the phrase “duck tours,” is generic and\n\nnot entitled to Lanham Act protection.           In response, Boston Duck\n\nargued that its mark, BOSTON DUCK TOURS, was protected and not\n\n\n\n                                      -58-\n\fgeneric.32    Therefore, the parties in the first instance introduced\n\nthe term “generic” into the analysis of the second element of\n\ninfringement.\n\n             “Generic”   is   a   term   of   art   used   as   part   of   the\n\nclassification analysis to determine whether a trademark is entitled\n\nto Lanham Act protection under the first element of trademark\n\ninfringement.33    If the asserted mark is entitled to protection, the\n\nsecond element of the infringement analysis focuses on whether the\n\nuse of the allegedly infringing mark is likely to cause confusion\n\nwith the protected mark.          Borinquen Biscuit, 443 F.3d at 116.\n\nFollowing the lead of the parties, the district court conflated the\n\ntwo elements of an infringement analysis.           After having stated that\n\nBoston Duck’s ownership of a protected mark, BOSTON DUCK TOURS, was\n\nnot disputed, the district court nevertheless analyzed the phrase\n\n“duck tours” to determine whether it was a “generic mark,” when it\n\nconsidered the eighth Pignons factor, the strength of the mark.\n\n             In considering the eighth factor, the court noted that it\n\nwas the cornerstone of Super Duck’s case and that Super Duck’s\n\n     32\n      When the party claiming infringement has registered its\ntrademark on the Principal Register, a presumption arises that the\nmark is entitled to Lanham Act protection. Colt, 486 F.3d at 705.\nFurther, when a mark has become incontestable, pursuant to 15\nU.S.C. § 1065, as is the case here, registration is conclusive\nevidence that the mark merits protection.

The court then considered\n\nwhether the phrase “duck tours” was generic or whether it was\n\nprotectable under the Lanham Act and concluded: “Although the Court\n\nis not convinced that ‘duck tours’ is a very strong mark it is, at\n\nleast, not a generic mark.

Because the parties agreed that Boston\n\nDuck’s mark was protected, the first part of the infringement\n\nanalysis has no place in this case.     See id.   Instead, the case\n\nturns on the second element, whether there is a likelihood of\n\nconsumer confusion between Boston Duck’s mark and logo and Super\n\nDuck’s mark and logo, which is determined by applying the Pignons\n\nfactors, not by considering whether part of a mark is entitled to\n\ntrademark protection.\n\n          Furthermore, the “anti-dissection rule” instructs that\n\ncomposite trademarks, those with more than one word, are considered\n\nas a whole for purposes of determining a likelihood of consumer\n\nconfusion.   3 McCarthy § 23:41.

Therefore, “duck tours” should\n\nnot be considered the dominant part of their marks.\n\n             Instead, the marks’ first words are their most salient\n\nfeatures. “Super” refers to the characteristics of the tour, while\n\n“Boston” suggests its geography. The overall impression, therefore,\n\nsuggests a similar tour offered by different enterprises.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -65-\n\f            The logos reinforce the differences.    Boston Duck's logo\n\nconsists of a white oval within which is a circle with a black\n\nborder framing a yellow cartoon duck. The duck sits on blue water\n\nfacing out directly from the center of the circle with a purple\n\nbackdrop.   Written around the top of the circle is the name BOSTON\n\nDUCK TOURS in uniform black lettering.       The yellow cartoon duck\n\nwears a camouflage hat and is flapping its wings into water, causing\n\nthe blue-and-white-tipped water to splash outside of the circle.\n\n            Super Duck's logo is a blue oval with darker blue accents,\n\ndenoting water.     Toward the top of the logo, and getting smaller\n\nacross the logo to suggest motion from left to right, the trade name\n\nSUPER DUCK TOURS is printed in orange.     “SUPER” is the largest and\n\nmost prominent feature of the mark as used in the logo.        At the\n\ncenter of the logo is a duck tour vehicle with a cartoon duck head\n\nand wings on the front and a duck tail on the rear of the vehicle.\n\nThe duck vehicle with its wheels depicted is moving from a black\n\nroad into the water.    On the front of the vehicle are the head and\n\nshoulders of a cartoon duck with an orange cape flowing behind and\n\nover the vehicle.    With one of its two muscular wings, the duck is\n\nholding up an orange flag    with the words “Charlestown, MA” on it.\n\nPassengers crowd together along the side of the duck vehicle, which\n\nhas \"Super Duck Tours\" written on its side.        As the duck vehicle\n\nenters the water, white water splashes into the air.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -66-\n\f          Although both logos show cartoon ducks, the ducks are used\n\ndifferently.     Super Duck’s logo emphasizes its super hero theme and\n\nits new vehicle, while Boston Duck’s logo focuses on the duck’s head\n\nwith a camouflage hat, a reference to the World War II vehicles used\n\nby Boston Duck. The obvious differences between the marks and logos\n\nstrengthen the conclusion that they are not confusingly similar.\n\nIf consumers viewed the marks and logos in the marketplace, without\n\nprior exposure to only Boston Duck’s mark and logo, they would not\n\nbe confused.\n\n          2. Similarity of Services\n\n          The tour services offered by Boston Duck and Super Duck\n\nare similar, and the district court found them to be virtually\n\nidentical.   Super Duck does not challenge that part of the district\n\ncourt’s order.\n\n          3. Channels of Trade, Advertising, and Customers\n\n          The third, fourth, and fifth Pignons factors are often\n\nconsidered together.     Attrezzi, 436 F.3d at 39.    The parties do not\n\ndispute   that    they   share   channels   of   trade,   customers,   and\n\nadvertising.\n\n          4.     Actual Confusion\n\n          Evidence that consumers are actually confused by similar\n\nmarks provides the best proof of the likelihood of future confusion.\n\nId. at 40. Evidence of actual confusion, however, may be the result\n\nof external factors unrelated to the similarity of the marks.\n\n\n\n                                    -67-\n\fAnheuser-Busch, Inc. v. L & L Wings, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582565\"><a href=\"/opinion/582565/anheuser-busch-incorporated-v-l-l-wings-incorporated-and-venture/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320 (4th\n\nCir. 1992). While trademarks are intended to protect against unfair\n\ncompetition, they are not intended to perpetuate product monopolies.\n\nId.\n\n           Boston Duck provided evidence that some consumers were\n\nconfused when Super Duck began operations in Boston in the summer\n\nof 2007.   Some consumers would buy tickets for Super Duck tours and\n\nthen arrive at Boston Duck’s departure sites for tours.    Taken in\n\nthe proper context, however, the confusion that has occurred between\n\nSuper Duck and Boston Duck during the first few weeks of Super\n\nDuck’s operations in the Boston area was more likely caused by\n\nBoston’s Duck unique position during the thirteen years that it\n\noperated the only amphibious tour service in the Boston area.36   As\n\na result, Boston Duck has enjoyed a monopoly in that segment of the\n\ntour service industry in the Boston area.   In contrast, if several\n\namphibious tour services had been operating in the Boston area when\n\nSuper Duck began operations, a duck tour would be less likely to be\n\nassociated with a single company.37\n\n           Trademark laws, however, cannot be used to perpetuate a\n\nproduct monopoly if the competing trademarks are not otherwise\n\nconfusingly similar.    Because I conclude that Boston Duck’s and\n\n      36\n      The record also suggests that confusion may have been\nexacerbated by the company Super Duck hired to sell its tickets.\n      37\n      For example, consumers would not confuse “Boston Pizza” with\n“Super Pizza” because they expect a variety of pizza businesses to\nco-exist.\n\n                                -68-\n\fSuper Duck’s marks and logos are not confusingly similar, I am\n\nunpersuaded by the evidence of actual confusion.\n\n             5. Intent\n\n             Whether the defendant acted in bad faith in adopting its\n\nmark   is   another       factor   to   be   considered   in   determining     the\n\nlikelihood of consumer confusion.                 Attrezzi, 436 F.3d at 40.\n\nEvidence that the defendant intended to take advantage of the\n\nplaintiff’s reputation, goodwill, and promotion of its product by\n\nadopting a similar mark is probative of the likelihood of consumer\n\nconfusion. Star Fin. Servs., Inc. v. AASTAR Mortgage Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721476\"><a href=\"/opinion/721476/star-financial-services-inc-dba-star-mortgage-v-aastar-mortgage/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11 (1st Cir. 1996).         Evidence of the defendant’s good faith in\n\nadopting its mark, however, does not show that consumer confusion\n\nis unlikely.        Id.\n\n             Boston Duck argues that Super Duck intended to trade off\n\nof Boston Duck’s goodwill by using SUPER DUCK TOURS as its mark.\n\nIn support of that theory, Boston Duck contends that Super Duck was\n\naware of Boston Duck’s trademark, its logo, and its associated\n\nreputation when it moved its operations from Portland, Maine to\n\nBoston.     Those    circumstances,      Boston   Duck    asserts,   support   an\n\ninference of Super Duck’s bad faith.\n\n             The evidence shows, however, that Super Duck adopted its\n\nmark when it began operating in Portland six years before it moved\n\nto Boston.     Boston Duck does not contend that use of the mark in\n\n\n\n\n                                        -69-\n\fPortland infringed its trademark. The circumstances here do not\n\nsupport an inference of bad faith.\n\n           6. Strength of the Mark\n\n           The last Pignons factor evaluates the relative strength\n\nof the marks based on practical considerations.   Attrezzi, 436 F.3d\n\nat 40.   Strength is measured by considering “the length of time the\n\nmark has been used, the trademark holder’s renown in the industry,\n\nthe potency of the mark in the product field (as measured by the\n\nnumber of similar registered marks), and the trademark holder’s\n\nefforts to promote and protect the mark.” Borinquen, 443 F.3d at\n\n121.\n\n           The evidence shows that Boston Duck Tours has used its\n\ntrademark and logo since 1994.     Super Duck began to use its mark\n\nseven years later, in 2001, in Portland, Maine. The first duck tour\n\napparently began in Wisconsin just after World War II. Indeed,\n\nBoston Duck acknowledges on its website that it is not the first or\n\nthe only duck tour. Therefore, although Boston Duck has more\n\nlongevity than Super Duck, Boston Duck was not the first duck tour\n\nnor is it apparently the longest running duck tour in the industry.\n\n           Boston Duck demonstrates that it is renowned in the Boston\n\narea for its sightseeing tours.   Its fame is due at least in part,\n\nhowever, to the position it has enjoyed as the only duck tour\n\nservice in the Boston area. Boston Duck’s recognition in tour\n\nmagazines and the awards it cites are focused on its unique Boston\n\n\n\n                                 -70-\n\fservice.   As such, the evidence does not show that Boston Duck has\n\nunusual renown in the    industry as a whole, when compared to\n\namphibious tours offered elsewhere.\n\n           The record evidence shows that many other amphibious\n\nvehicle sightseeing companies, outside of Boston, provide the same\n\nservice, use the term “duck” or “duck tour” in their names or in\n\ndescribing their services, and show a cartoon duck in their logos.38\n\nEven Boston Duck’s means of conveyance, the World War II DUKWs, is\n\nnot unique. The record also shows that other duck tour companies\n\nhave applied to register names with the term “duck tours,” including\n\nSuper Duck, and that other trademarks which include the term “duck\n\ntours” have been registered with the PTO.\n\n           Boston Duck protected its mark by registering its word\n\nmark and its logo with the PTO in 2002. Boston Duck represents that\n\nits declarations for use and incontestibility of the mark were\n\naccepted by the PTO in July of 2007.   In its registration, however,\n\nBoston Duck disclaimed the right to use the word “duck” and the word\n\n“tours” apart from its mark, BOSTON DUCK TOURS.   Boston Duck states\n\n\n\n\n     38\n      In fact, this is not the first dispute about similar services\nthat has landed a duck tour company in court. See, e.g., Ride the\nDucks of Phil. LLC v.

Weighing the Pignons Factors\n\n            Although several of the pertinent factors for determining\n\nwhether Boston Duck has shown a likelihood of consumer confusion\n\nbetween its mark and logo and Super Duck’s mark and logo are\n\nconceded,    those   that   are   contested,    when   viewed   under   the\n\nappropriate standard, weigh strongly against finding a likelihood\n\nof consumer confusion.      Boston Duck Tours is not a strong mark,\n\nparticularly because its reputation is built at least in part on\n\nhaving introduced the amphibious tour service to Boston and having\n\nbeen the only such tour in Boston for thirteen years.           Duck tours,\n\nhowever, have been and continue to be available in other cities in\n\nthis country and internationally.\n\n            Despite their shared use of the phrase “duck tours,” the\n\noverall impression of the Boston Duck and Super Duck marks and logos\n\nis that they are not similar.             Although Boston Duck provided\n\nevidence of actual consumer confusion, such confusion is likely more\n\nthe result of Boston Duck’s unique position in Boston rather than\n\n\n\n                                   -72-\n\fany similarity in the marks and logos. Finally, the record does not\n\nsupport an inference that Super Duck adopted its name in bad faith\n\nto trade off of Boston Duck’s reputation.   In sum, Boston Duck has\n\nnot shown that it is likely to succeed on its infringement claim by\n\nshowing a likelihood of consumer confusion between the marks and\n\nlogos.\n\nB.
