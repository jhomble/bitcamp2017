We think not.\n\nBecause  the court below applied  a contrary rule,  we vacate the\n\njudgment and remand for further development of the record.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Plaintiff-appellant  Leonard  J. LeBlanc  worked  as an\n\nengineer aboard the F/V RESOLUTE, a commercial fishing boat owned\n\nby defendant-appellee B.G.T. Corporation.1   The RESOLUTE set out\n\nfrom  Fairhaven, Massachusetts  on September  25, 1991.   Shortly\n\nafter its departure, the  vessel broke down and returned  to port\n\nfor   minor  repairs.    It  then  headed  back  to  sea  with  a\n\nrehabilitated winch  and renewed hopes, but,  it appears, against\n\nthe winds of fortune.  The crew's efforts produced few fish.\n\n          Appellant  grew  uneasy  in  the  face of  disappointed\n\nexpectations.   Since  his  remuneration would  reflect both  the\n\nvalue of  the catch and the  expense of the voyage,  he sought to\n\ntruncate  what had  become a  relatively unproductive  and costly\n\ntrip.   His  importunings  placed him  at  loggerheads  with  the\n\n                    \n\n     1The  litigants, who  do  not agree  on  very much,  have  a\ndifference of  opinion as  to nomenclature.    Although the  case\ncaption and appellant's filings refer to the defendant as \"B.G.T.\nCorporation,\"  the defendant persists  in styling  itself \"B.T.G.\nFisheries, Inc.\"  This seems to us small beer, and  we, following\nboth alphabetical order and the lead of the magistrate judge, use\nthe former appellation.\n\n                                2\n\ncaptain, and a heated confrontation ensued.  Although the parties\n\nvigorously  debate the  exact  content of  this  war of  words   \n\nappellant may or may not have  been cashiered then and there   it\n\nis  undisputed that  the RESOLUTE  turned back,  arriving  in New\n\nBedford  during the night of  October 9.   The following morning,\n\nthe  crew dislodged the catch.   The RESOLUTE then made the five-\n\nminute journey to her  dock in Fairhaven.   Throughout, appellant\n\ncontinued to perform the ship's work.\n\n          Once the vessel docked, appellant, assisted by a fellow\n\ncrew  member, Peter Lynch, began unloading his gear.  During this\n\nprocess, or  shortly thereafter, the captain  approached and gave\n\nappellant his \"per.\"2   Another argument erupted.  In  the course\n\nof  this brouhaha, the captain  either told or reminded appellant\n\nthat  he was fired  and, at any  rate, ordered him  to remove his\n\nbelongings  from  the  boat.    Ten  to  fifteen  minutes  later,\n\nappellant slipped while descending the stairs  to the engine room\n\nand broke his right foot.\n\n          It remains unclear exactly what transpired in the brief\n\ninterval between  the second  imbroglio  and the  accident.   The\n\nparties agree that appellant removed some additional gear that he\n\nroutinely  kept aboard  the  RESOLUTE between  voyages; but  they\n\ndisagree  as  to exactly  how  he accomplished  this  feat, i.e.,\n                                                                \n\nwhether  he exited the  vessel during  the unloading  process or,\n\n                    \n\n     2A \"per\" is a  bonus provided to certain crew  members, like\nthe  engineer, whose  duties include  the performance  of special\ntasks.   Appellant did not  receive his basic  remuneration   his\ncrewman's \"share\"   until a later time.\n\n                                3\n\ninstead, stayed on board and handed his possessions over the side\n\nto Lynch.   The  record is  similarly obscure  concerning whether\n\nappellant succeeded  in removing all  his gear prior  to injuring\n\nhimself  or, instead, as he claimed at trial, had yet to retrieve\n\nhis boots from the engine room.\n\n          Following  the  mishap, appellant  received maintenance\n\nchecks for a period of time.  As soon as  the employer's attorney\n\ngot wind  of  the accident  and  suggested that  appellant,  when\n\ninjured, was  no longer in the ship's  service, the flow of funds\n\nstopped.  Appellant then sued, including in his complaint a count\n\nfor  maintenance and cure under general maritime law.  That count\n\nwas tried by mutual  consent before a  magistrate judge.  See  28\n                                                             \n\nU.S.C.   636(c)(1) (1988).  After a two-day trial, the magistrate\n\ndenied recovery for maintenance and cure.  LeBlanc appeals.3\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\n\n          The magistrate reasoned that appellant was not entitled\n\nto maintenance and cure because, as a matter of  law, that remedy\n\ncannot  attach after termination of employment.  Since this was a\n\nbench trial in  an admiralty case,  the magistrate's findings  of\n\nfact are reviewable only for clear error.  See, e.g.,  DiMillo v.\n                                                              \n\nSheepscot Pilots,  Inc.,  870  F.2d  746, 749  (1st  Cir.  1989);\n                       \n\nClauson v. Smith,  823 F.2d 660, 661  (1st Cir. 1987).   However,\n                \n\n                    \n\n     3LeBlanc also sued  for negligence under  the Jones Act,  46\nU.S.C. app.   688  (1988), and for unseaworthiness under  general\nmaritime law.   These claims remain in  drydock.  Notwithstanding\nthe case's  odd posture,  we have appellate  jurisdiction because\nthe magistrate's order definitively resolved the maintenance-and-\ncure count.   See 28  U.S.C.   1292(a)(3)  (1988) (providing  for\n                 \nliberal interlocutory appeals in admiralty cases).\n\n                                4\n\nappellant  does not  claim that  the magistrate  misperceived the\n\nfacts, but, rather, that she applied an incorrect legal standard.\n\nWe consider  this  claim of  legal error  de novo.   See  Liberty\n                                                                 \n\nMutual Ins. Co. v.  Commercial Union Ins. Co., 978  F.2d 750, 757\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir.  1992);  Dedham Water  Co. v.  Cumberland Farms  Dairy,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir. 1992).\n    \n\n                                A\n\n          Before addressing the merits of the appeal, we limn the\n\nseascape  against which it arises.  From time immemorial, the law\n\nof  the sea has required shipowners to ensure the maintenance and\n\ncure of seamen who fall ill or become injured while in service of\n\nthe  ship.   See, e.g.,  1B Ellen  M. Flynn  et al.,  Benedict on\n                                                                 \n\nAdmiralty    41-42 (6th ed. 1993) (finding the requirement extant\n         \n\nin  the Laws of  Oleron and other ancient  admiralty codes).  The\n\nduty to provide maintenance and cure is today a firmly entrenched\n\naccouterment  of  general maritime  law.   See, e.g.,  Aguilar v.\n                                                              \n\nStandard Oil Co., 318 U.S. 724, 726 (1943); The Osceola, 189 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n158, 175 (1903).\n\n          The term \"maintenance and cure\" refers to the provision\n\nof, or payment for,  food and lodging (\"maintenance\") as  well as\n\nany necessary health-care expenses  (\"cure\") incurred during  the\n\nperiod of recovery from an injury or malady.  See, e.g., Aguilar,\n                                                                \n\n318 U.S. at 730; Calmar Steamship Corp. v. Taylor, 303 U.S.  525,\n                                                 \n\n528  (1938).   As the  label implies,  the right  is  curative in\n\nnature  and  is thus  to  be distinguished  from  other admiralty\n\nrights, such as the right  to recover lost wages or the  right to\n\n                                5\n\nrecover  for a  shipowner's negligence,  which are  compensatory.\n\nSee Aguilar,  318 U.S. at 730.  The right to maintenance and cure\n           \n\nattaches largely  without regard to  fault; a seaman  may forfeit\n\nhis entitlement only by engaging in gross misconduct.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nCalmar, 303  U.S. at 527-29.   And,  moreover, once the  right to\n      \n\nmaintenance   and  cure  has  attached,  the  injured  employee's\n\nentitlement continues, even after  termination of service,  until\n\nhe is  \"so far cured as possible.\"  Farrell v. United States, 336\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 511, 518 (1949); accord Clauson, 823 F.2d at 661 n.1.\n                                    \n\n          Developed though the doctrine  may be in some respects,\n\nits  scope  has never  been precisely  delineated.   While  it is\n\ncommon ground that the right is available only to a \"seaman\"  who\n\nis  \"in service  of the ship\"  at the  time an  injury or illness\n\neventuates,  see Aguilar, 318 U.S.  at 732; Osceola,  189 U.S. at\n                                                   \n\n175, the  meaning of these imbricated terms has evolved piecemeal\n\nover many  decades and  attempts at further  refinement typically\n\nhave been imbued  with the factual residuum of  particular cases.\n\nSee, e.g., McDermott  Int'l, Inc.  v. Wilander, 111  S. Ct.  807,\n                                              \n\n814-16, 818 (1991);  Senko v. LaCrosse  Dredging Corp., 352  U.S.\n                                                      \n\n370, 374 (1957).4  Thus, there are lingering questions as  to the\n\nexact  manner  in  which  the  right  to  maintenance   and  cure\n\n                    \n\n     4Although the cited cases involve  the Jones Act, 46  U.S.C.\napp.   688,  general maritime  law and the  jurisprudence of  the\nJones  Act have largely evolved in tandem.   See Wilander, 111 S.\n                                                         \nCt. at 810-11.  Moreover, those falling within the prophylaxis of\nthe Jones  Act  are also  among  the  class of  persons  who  are\nafforded  the primary  protections  of general  maritime law,  of\nwhich maintenance  and cure is a prime exemplar.  See 1B Flynn et\n                                                     \nal., Benedict on Admiralty, supra,   44.\n                                 \n\n                                6\n\ninterfaces with the employment relationship.  It is, for example,\n\nstill  unsettled whether  the right  to maintenance  and cure  is\n\ncoterminous  with,  and  a  contractual  attribute  of,  employed\n\nstatus,  or,  instead, whether  the  right retains  a  measure of\n\nindependent force.  See 2  Martin J. Norris, The Law of  Seamen  \n                                                               \n\n26:10 (4th ed. 1985) (collecting cases).\n\n          The instant case requires us to explore these uncharted\n\nwaters,  for  B.G.T.  contends,  and  the  magistrate  apparently\n\nbelieved,  that  termination of  employment,  in  and of  itself,\n\nnecessarily and always prevents  subsequent attachment of a right\n\nto  maintenance and cure.  We reject this thesis, concluding that\n\nthe right  to  maintenance  and  cure stems  from  the  employer-\n\nemployee relationship but is  not in all circumstances completely\n\ncoextensive with it.  As we explain below,  a number of different\n\nconsiderations undergird this conclusion.\n\n                                B\n\n          One  pylon   upon  which   our  holding  rests   is  an\n\nappreciation of  the historical purpose of  maintenance and cure.\n\nA  common thread running through the reported cases, some of them\n\ncenturies old, is that maintenance and cure must always be viewed\n\nas an alleviatory remedy.   Seamen should receive it  because the\n\nnature  of their  employment necessitates  their exposure  to the\n\npeculiar hazards of seafaring life while at the same time leaving\n\nthem  utterly dependent  on the  ship, which  serves as  the very\n\nframework for their existence.   See, e.g., Farrell, 336  U.S. at\n                                                   \n\n514-16; Aguilar, 318 U.S. at 731-34; Harden v. Gordon, 11 F.

Because it was feared that without the\n\nright  to  maintenance  and  cure  as  an  inducement  few  might\n\nwillingly  devote themselves  to a  way of  life that  would both\n\nrender them  at risk and leave them friendless in the face of the\n\nassumed risk, see Calmar, 303 U.S. at 528; see also Macedo v. F/V\n                                                                 \n\nPaul  &amp; Michelle,  868  F.2d  519,  521  (1st  Cir.  1989)  (\"The\n                \n\nobligation for maintenance and cure arose, historically, from the\n\nirresponsible  behavior of  shipowners  who set  disabled  seamen\n\nashore at foreign ports to shift for themselves.\"),  the benefits\n\nof  maintenance  and cure  have not  been  limited to  victims of\n\npredictable shipboard injuries.   For instance, in ruling that  a\n\nseaman injured while on shore leave could receive maintenance and\n\ncure, Justice Rutledge wrote:\n\n               The voyage creates not only the need for\n          relaxation ashore, but the necessity  that it\n          be satisfied in distant and unfamiliar ports.\n          If, in  those surroundings, the seaman  . . .\n          incurs injury, it  is because of  the voyage,\n          the  shipowner's business.  That business has\n          separated  him  from   his  usual  places  of\n          association.  . . .  In sum, it is the ship's\n          business  which  subjects the  seaman  to the\n          risks  attending  hours   of  relaxation   in\n          strange surroundings.  Accordingly, it is but\n          reasonable  that the business extend the same\n          protections  against injury  from them  as it\n          gives for other risks of the employment.\n\nAguilar,  318 U.S.  at  734.   This  historical perspective     a\n       \n\nseaman's  lifestyle  makes  him   dependent  on  the  ship  while\n\n                                8\n\nsimultaneously ensuring  his exposure to the  variegated risks of\n\nseafaring, thus warranting an alleviatory remedy   is what stands\n\nbehind, and gives meaning  to, the black letter rule  that seamen\n\nwho are,  broadly speaking,  in the  ship's service when  injured\n\nmerit maintenance and cure.\n\n                                C\n\n          A second pylon upon  which our holding rests  goes hand\n\nin glove  with this historical perspective.   Linguistically, the\n\nentitlement  to   maintenance  and  cure  must   not  be  defined\n\ngrudgingly.   While the \"seaman in service\" language has at times\n\nappeared  to acquire  a restrictive  gloss, we  believe that  any\n\nmeaningful  interpretation of  the phrase  must remain  moored to\n\nmaintenance  and   cure's   core   purpose:      palliating   the\n\ndisadvantages of seafaring life.  Thus, the nature of the right\n\n          require[s] that  it be not  narrowly confined\n          or   whittled   down   by   restrictive   and\n          artificial  distinctions defeating  its broad\n          and beneficial purposes.   If leeway is to be\n          given   in   either   direction,    all   the\n          considerations which brought the [right] into\n          being  dictate it should  be in  the sailor's\n          behalf.\n\nAguilar, 318 U.S. at 735.\n       \n\n          It  is for  this  reason that  a certain  expansiveness\n\nrightfully attends determinations of whether a person is a seaman\n\nin service of  the ship.  To cite one  example, we recently ruled\n\nthat  a sailor  injured  at  home on  a  Sunday was  entitled  to\n\nmaintenance and cure although his ship  was not due to sail until\n\nthe  following Tuesday,  observing that  \"the captain  could have\n\nchanged  his  mind  and  decided  to  sail  Monday  and  required\n\n                                9\n\nplaintiff to  do the  preparatory  boat work  Sunday, holiday  or\n\nnot.\"  Macedo, 868  F.2d at 520-21.   As this illustration  makes\n             \n\nclear, if a person  is enduring circumstances which, in  a rather\n\ngeneral sense, further the ship's purposes, he may well be deemed\n\nin the ship's service.  Accord  Farrell, 336 U.S. at 516 (holding\n                                       \n\nthat  a seaman  is  in the  ship's service  when he  is generally\n\nanswerable to the call of duty).\n\n          The Supreme Court's most  recent visit to these straits\n\nexemplifies  the  same strain  of  interpretive  generosity in  a\n\nslightly  different  context.   In  Wilander,  an employee  whose\n                                            \n\nduties  consisted  of supervising  the  painting  of a  sea-bound\n\ndrilling  platform was  injured.   He  sued,  seeking a  seaman's\n\nremedies.  The Court,  refusing to impose a requirement  that, to\n\nbe  a  seaman,  one  must aid  in  the  navigation  of  a vessel,\n\nconcluded instead that \"[t]he key to seaman status is employment-\n\nrelated connection to a vessel.\"  Wilander, 111 S. Ct. at 817.5\n                                          \n\n          In sum, the motivational impetus behind maintenance and\n\ncure dictates availability of  the anodyne whenever a plaintiff's\n\n                    \n\n     5It  can, of course, be  argued that cases  dealing with the\nquestion of who qualifies  as a seaman, see, e.g.,  Wilander, 111\n                                                            \nS.  Ct. at  807,  are distinguishable.    However, the  two  most\nfrequently asked questions in  seamen's cases   Who is  a seaman?\nWas the seaman  in service of  the ship?    overlap.  The  former\nquestion  usually reduces  to  asking:   How  connected with  the\nship's function must  a person's duties be in  order for the mine\nrun of  rights under maritime law to attach?  The latter question\nusually  reduces to  asking:    How  connected  with  the  ship's\nfunction must  the injury-inducing circumstances be  in order for\nsuch  rights to attach?   In our estimation,  the answers to both\nquestions  shed light  upon  the quandary  we face  here, namely,\nwhether  it is necessarily true  that a seaman  in service of the\nvessel instantly loses that status upon discharge.\n\n                                10\n\ninjury  or   illness  occurs  amidst  circumstances   endured  in\n\nfurtherance of, and as  a result of, an employment, the duties of\n\nwhich  help accomplish  the  mission of  a vessel  in navigation.\n\nThis formulation makes clear that, while the right to maintenance\n\nand cure stems from a person's  employment, there is no reason to\n\nassume that  the right and  the employment are  conterminous with\n\neach other.   Indeed, the  decided cases  indicate the  contrary.\n\nSee  Aguilar, 318  U.S.  at 730  (explaining  that the  right  to\n            \n\nmaintenance  and  cure  arises  \"as an  incident  of  the  marine\n\nemployer-employee  relationship\");  Cortes  v. Baltimore  Insular\n                                                                 \n\nLine, Inc., 287 U.S.  367, 371 (1932) (explaining that  the right\n          \n\nto maintenance and cure  \"has its source  in a relation which  is\n\ncontractual in origin\").\n\n                                D\n\n          A  third pylon  on which  our holding rests  reflects a\n\npolicy  judgment.     We   recognize  that  the   possibility  of\n\nmaintenance  and cure attaching  will end in  most instances when\n\nthe  employment  relationship  expires.     But,  this  need  not\n\ninvariably  be the  case.  We  are of  the opinion  that taking a\n\nmechanical  approach, as  appellee urges,  would as  a matter  of\n\npolicy  be incompatible  with  the Court's  repeated eschewal  of\n\nsharp-edged rules limiting seamen's rights.  See, e.g., Wilander,\n                                                                \n\n111 S.  Ct. at 817-18; Desper v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., 342 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n187, 190 (1952).\n\n          What  is more, a strict cut-off point of the sort urged\n\nby  appellee  would sometimes  run  at  cross  purposes with  the\n\n                                11\n\nhistorical   antecedents   and   definitional    imperatives   of\n\nmaintenance and cure.  See supra Parts II(B), (C).  We think this\n                                \n\nis so because the life of a seaman requires that he be drawn into\n\nthe  separate world of the ship and subjected to the unique risks\n\npresent therein.  If he is  terminated while still in that realm,\n\nthe separation  and its risks    which are,  after all,  the twin\n\nrationales for providing maintenance and cure    do not instantly\n\nevaporate.   Nor,  therefore, does  the seaman's  persona change,\n\nlike Cinderella  at the stroke of twelve,  from a servitor of the\n\nship  to a  landlubbing interloper.   Rather, the  title \"seaman\"\n\nmust remain attached  at least until the  individual has finished\n\nhis  shipboard tasks  (unless duly  relieved of  them) and  had a\n\nreasonable chance  to  exit  from the  maritime  realm,  or,  put\n\nanother way, for so long as the twin  rationales remain in force.\n\nJust as the Court deemed Aguilar  a seaman in service of the ship\n\nbecause the risks inherent in his  situation were necessitated by\n\nthe ship's  business, see Aguilar,  318 U.S. at  734, so,  too, a\n                                 \n\nperson  cashiered  while  on  board a  vessel  remains  a  seaman\n\nfurthering its purposes at least until he is afforded  reasonable\n\ntime and opportunity for disembarkation.\n\n                                E\n\n          The  last pylon on which our holding rests is hewn from\n\nthe  caselaw.   There is  a venerable  court of  appeals decision\n\ndirectly on  point in  which the  plaintiff,  after being  fired,\n\ninjured  himself while leaving the ship.  The Fourth Circuit held\n\nthat\n\n                                12\n\n          the  obligation  of   the  ship  to   furnish\n          maintenance  and  cure attaches  to accidents\n          which  happen in  the brief  interval between\n          the time  a seaman  is paid off  and formally\n          discharged and the  subsequent time at which,\n          in   ordinary   course,   he  actually   gets\n          physically away from  her.  He went on her as\n          a seaman, and for the  purpose in hand he did\n          not cease to be one  until he was safely  off\n          her.\n\nThe Michael Tracy, 295 F.  680, 681 (4th Cir. 1924).   We believe\n                 \n\nthat  this statement  of  the law  continues  to shine  brightly,\n\nundimmed by the passage of time.6\n\n          We  discern   further   decisional  support   for   our\n\nconclusion in  the closely related area  of workers' compensation\n\nlaw.  Although statutes  differ from state to state,  the general\n\nrule  stipulates   that  \"coverage   is  not   automatically  and\n\ninstantaneously  terminated  by the  firing  or  quitting of  the\n\nemployee\" but extends for a reasonable period thereafter so  that\n\nthe  employee  may  \"wind[]  up   his  affairs  and  leave[]  the\n\npremises.\"  1A Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmen's Compensation  \n                                                               \n\n26.10  (1993) (collecting  cases);  see also  id.     26:30-26:40\n                                                 \n\n(indicating that  a \"reasonable period\" incident  to severance of\n\nemployment encompasses  time to pick  up a paycheck  and retrieve\n\n                    \n\n     6B.G.T. suggests  that Fisher v.

First, Fisher's  reasoning depends  upon\n                                      \nstatements  (dicta  in  decisions  and  passages  in  commentary)\ntreating  with unrelated questions.  See id. at 1577-78.  Second,\n                                            \nnone of this  rumination actually rules out  recovery by recently\nfired employees.  See id.  On the whole, Fisher is unsupported by\n                                               \nthe authorities upon which it purports to rely.  Hence,  we, like\nthe commentators, see,  e.g., 2 Norris, supra,    26.31, consider\n                                             \nTracy more persuasive.\n     \n\n                                13\n\npersonal effects);  Elmer H.

The  four  pylons we  have\n\ndescribed  form  an  integrated  foundation.   Building  on  that\n\nfoundation, we hold that  the right to maintenance and  cure made\n\navailable by general  maritime law to  seamen injured or  falling\n\nill while in service of the ship may attach after  termination of\n\nemployment so long as the triggering event takes place within the\n\nperiod of time  reasonably needed for the accomplishment of tasks\n\nin  general furtherance of  winding up the  seaman's employment  \n\nthe  prototypical  examples   being  removing  one's  belongings,\n\nquitting the ship,  or implementing  direct orders  given at  the\n\ntime of discharge.\n\n                                14\n\n          In  the case  at hand, the  magistrate judge  applied a\n\ndifferent, incorrect legal standard.  Moreover, the record is not\n\nsufficiently developed to allow us to resolve the  controversy by\n\nregrouping the available  findings of fact along the proper legal\n\nmatrix.7   The  case must,  therefore,  be remanded  for  further\n\nconsideration in  light of  this opinion,  and  for such  further\n\nproceedings as may be required.  Although it is apparent that the\n\nentire case need not be retried, we in no way intend to limit the\n\nscope of the magistrate judge's inquiry on remand, but leave that\n\nto  her informed discretion.  In the  same vein, we see no reason\n\nfor the interposition of a new trier.\n\nVacated and remanded.

(1) The record\nis inscrutable with  regard to whether LeBlanc,  after the second\nimbroglio,  alighted from  the  RESOLUTE, and  then returned,  or\nwhether he  remained on board.   (2) There is some  dubiety as to\nwhether LeBlanc, at the  time of his injury,  was carrying out  a\ndirect order  to remove his gear  from the ship.   The magistrate\nmade  no clear finding  on either point, nor  did she address the\nquestion of  when LeBlanc's injury  occurred with respect  to the\nreasonable  period  of time  needed  to  wind  up his  legitimate\nbusiness on board the RESOLUTE.\n\n                                15\n",

BACKGROUND\n\n          Plaintiff-appellant  Leonard  J. LeBlanc  worked  as an\n\nengineer aboard the F/V RESOLUTE, a commercial fishing boat owned\n\nby defendant-appellee B.G.T. Corporation.1   The RESOLUTE set out\n\nfrom  Fairhaven, Massachusetts  on September  25, 1991.   Shortly\n\nafter its departure, the  vessel broke down and returned  to port\n\nfor   minor  repairs.    It  then  headed  back  to  sea  with  a\n\nrehabilitated winch  and renewed hopes, but,  it appears, against\n\nthe winds of fortune.  The crew's efforts produced few fish.\n\n          Appellant  grew  uneasy  in  the  face of  disappointed\n\nexpectations.   Since  his  remuneration would  reflect both  the\n\nvalue of  the catch and the  expense of the voyage,  he sought to\n\ntruncate  what had  become a  relatively unproductive  and costly\n\ntrip.   His  importunings  placed him  at  loggerheads  with  the\n\n                    \n\n     1The  litigants, who  do  not agree  on  very much,  have  a\ndifference of  opinion as  to nomenclature.    Although the  case\ncaption and appellant's filings refer to the defendant as \"B.G.T.\nCorporation,\"  the defendant persists  in styling  itself \"B.T.G.\nFisheries, Inc.\"  This seems to us small beer, and  we, following\nboth alphabetical order and the lead of the magistrate judge, use\nthe former appellation.\n\n                                2\n\ncaptain, and a heated confrontation ensued.  Although the parties\n\nvigorously  debate the  exact  content of  this  war of  words   \n\nappellant may or may not have  been cashiered then and there   it\n\nis  undisputed that  the RESOLUTE  turned back,  arriving  in New\n\nBedford  during the night of  October 9.   The following morning,\n\nthe  crew dislodged the catch.   The RESOLUTE then made the five-\n\nminute journey to her  dock in Fairhaven.   Throughout, appellant\n\ncontinued to perform the ship's work.\n\n          Once the vessel docked, appellant, assisted by a fellow\n\ncrew  member, Peter Lynch, began unloading his gear.  During this\n\nprocess, or  shortly thereafter, the captain  approached and gave\n\nappellant his \"per.\"2   Another argument erupted.  In  the course\n\nof  this brouhaha, the captain  either told or reminded appellant\n\nthat  he was fired  and, at any  rate, ordered him  to remove his\n\nbelongings  from  the  boat.    Ten  to  fifteen  minutes  later,\n\nappellant slipped while descending the stairs  to the engine room\n\nand broke his right foot.\n\n          It remains unclear exactly what transpired in the brief\n\ninterval between  the second  imbroglio  and the  accident.   The\n\nparties agree that appellant removed some additional gear that he\n\nroutinely  kept aboard  the  RESOLUTE between  voyages; but  they\n\ndisagree  as  to exactly  how  he accomplished  this  feat, i.e.,\n                                                                \n\nwhether  he exited the  vessel during  the unloading  process or,\n\n                    \n\n     2A \"per\" is a  bonus provided to certain crew  members, like\nthe  engineer, whose  duties include  the performance  of special\ntasks.   Appellant did not  receive his basic  remuneration   his\ncrewman's \"share\"   until a later time.\n\n                                3\n\ninstead, stayed on board and handed his possessions over the side\n\nto Lynch.   The  record is  similarly obscure  concerning whether\n\nappellant succeeded  in removing all  his gear prior  to injuring\n\nhimself  or, instead, as he claimed at trial, had yet to retrieve\n\nhis boots from the engine room.\n\n          Following  the  mishap, appellant  received maintenance\n\nchecks for a period of time.  As soon as  the employer's attorney\n\ngot wind  of  the accident  and  suggested that  appellant,  when\n\ninjured, was  no longer in the ship's  service, the flow of funds\n\nstopped.  Appellant then sued, including in his complaint a count\n\nfor  maintenance and cure under general maritime law.  That count\n\nwas tried by mutual  consent before a  magistrate judge.  See  28\n                                                             \n\nU.S.C.   636(c)(1) (1988).  After a two-day trial, the magistrate\n\ndenied recovery for maintenance and cure.

ANALYSIS\n\n          The magistrate reasoned that appellant was not entitled\n\nto maintenance and cure because, as a matter of  law, that remedy\n\ncannot  attach after termination of employment.  Since this was a\n\nbench trial in  an admiralty case,  the magistrate's findings  of\n\nfact are reviewable only for clear error.  See, e.g.,  DiMillo v.\n                                                              \n\nSheepscot Pilots,  Inc.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520290\"><a href=\"/opinion/520290/antonio-dimillo-v-sheepscot-pilots-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 749  (1st  Cir.  1989);\n                       \n\nClauson v.

From time immemorial, the law\n\nof  the sea has required shipowners to ensure the maintenance and\n\ncure of seamen who fall ill or become injured while in service of\n\nthe  ship.   See, e.g.,  1B Ellen  M.

The\n\nduty to provide maintenance and cure is today a firmly entrenched\n\naccouterment  of  general maritime  law.

See, e.g., Aguilar,\n                                                                \n\n318 U.S. at 730; Calmar Steamship Corp. v.

As the  label implies,  the right  is  curative in\n\nnature  and  is thus  to  be distinguished  from  other admiralty\n\nrights, such as the right  to recover lost wages or the  right to\n\n                                5\n\nrecover  for a  shipowner's negligence,  which are  compensatory.\n\nSee Aguilar,  318 U.S. at 730.

See Wilander, 111 S.\n                                                         \nCt. at 810-11.  Moreover, those falling within the prophylaxis of\nthe Jones  Act  are also  among  the  class of  persons  who  are\nafforded  the primary  protections  of general  maritime law,  of\nwhich maintenance  and cure is a prime exemplar.  See 1B Flynn et\n                                                     \nal., Benedict on Admiralty, supra,   44.\n                                 \n\n                                6\n\ninterfaces with the employment relationship.

See 2  Martin J. Norris, The Law of  Seamen  \n                                                               \n\n26:10 (4th ed. 1985) (collecting cases).\n\n          The instant case requires us to explore these uncharted\n\nwaters,  for  B.G.T.  contends,  and  the  magistrate  apparently\n\nbelieved,  that  termination of  employment,  in  and of  itself,\n\nnecessarily and always prevents  subsequent attachment of a right\n\nto  maintenance and cure.  We reject this thesis, concluding that\n\nthe right  to  maintenance  and  cure stems  from  the  employer-\n\nemployee relationship but is  not in all circumstances completely\n\ncoextensive with it.  As we explain below,  a number of different\n\nconsiderations undergird this conclusion.\n\n                                B\n\n          One  pylon   upon  which   our  holding  rests   is  an\n\nappreciation of  the historical purpose of  maintenance and cure.\n\nA  common thread running through the reported cases, some of them\n\ncenturies old, is that maintenance and cure must always be viewed\n\nas an alleviatory remedy.   Seamen should receive it  because the\n\nnature  of their  employment necessitates  their exposure  to the\n\npeculiar hazards of seafaring life while at the same time leaving\n\nthem  utterly dependent  on the  ship, which  serves as  the very\n\nframework for their existence.   See, e.g., Farrell, 336  U.S. at\n                                                   \n\n514-16; Aguilar, 318 U.S. at 731-34; Harden v.

For instance, in ruling that  a\n\nseaman injured while on shore leave could receive maintenance and\n\ncure, Justice Rutledge wrote:\n\n               The voyage creates not only the need for\n          relaxation ashore, but the necessity  that it\n          be satisfied in distant and unfamiliar ports.\n          If, in  those surroundings, the seaman  . . .\n          incurs injury, it  is because of  the voyage,\n          the  shipowner's business.  That business has\n          separated  him  from   his  usual  places  of\n          association.  . . .  In sum, it is the ship's\n          business  which  subjects the  seaman  to the\n          risks  attending  hours   of  relaxation   in\n          strange surroundings.  Accordingly, it is but\n          reasonable  that the business extend the same\n          protections  against injury  from them  as it\n          gives for other risks of the employment.\n\nAguilar,  318 U.S.  at  734.   This  historical perspective     a\n       \n\nseaman's  lifestyle  makes  him   dependent  on  the  ship  while\n\n                                8\n\nsimultaneously ensuring  his exposure to the  variegated risks of\n\nseafaring, thus warranting an alleviatory remedy   is what stands\n\nbehind, and gives meaning  to, the black letter rule  that seamen\n\nwho are,  broadly speaking,  in the  ship's service when  injured\n\nmerit maintenance and cure.\n\n                                C\n\n          A second pylon upon  which our holding rests  goes hand\n\nin glove  with this historical perspective.   Linguistically, the\n\nentitlement  to   maintenance  and  cure  must   not  be  defined\n\ngrudgingly.   While the \"seaman in service\" language has at times\n\nappeared  to acquire  a restrictive  gloss, we  believe that  any\n\nmeaningful  interpretation of  the phrase  must remain  moored to\n\nmaintenance  and   cure's   core   purpose:      palliating   the\n\ndisadvantages of seafaring life.  Thus, the nature of the right\n\n          require[s] that  it be not  narrowly confined\n          or   whittled   down   by   restrictive   and\n          artificial  distinctions defeating  its broad\n          and beneficial purposes.   If leeway is to be\n          given   in   either   direction,    all   the\n          considerations which brought the [right] into\n          being  dictate it should  be in  the sailor's\n          behalf.\n\nAguilar, 318 U.S. at 735.\n       \n\n          It  is for  this  reason that  a certain  expansiveness\n\nrightfully attends determinations of whether a person is a seaman\n\nin service of  the ship.  To cite one  example, we recently ruled\n\nthat  a sailor  injured  at  home on  a  Sunday was  entitled  to\n\nmaintenance and cure although his ship  was not due to sail until\n\nthe  following Tuesday,  observing that  \"the captain  could have\n\nchanged  his  mind  and  decided  to  sail  Monday  and  required\n\n                                9\n\nplaintiff to  do the  preparatory  boat work  Sunday, holiday  or\n\nnot.\"  Macedo, 868  F.2d at 520-21.   As this illustration  makes\n             \n\nclear, if a person  is enduring circumstances which, in  a rather\n\ngeneral sense, further the ship's purposes, he may well be deemed\n\nin the ship's service.  Accord  Farrell, 336 U.S. at 516 (holding\n                                       \n\nthat  a seaman  is  in the  ship's service  when he  is generally\n\nanswerable to the call of duty).\n\n          The Supreme Court's most  recent visit to these straits\n\nexemplifies  the  same strain  of  interpretive  generosity in  a\n\nslightly  different  context.   In  Wilander,  an employee  whose\n                                            \n\nduties  consisted  of supervising  the  painting  of a  sea-bound\n\ndrilling  platform was  injured.

Ct. at  807,  are distinguishable.    However, the  two  most\nfrequently asked questions in  seamen's cases   Who is  a seaman?\nWas the seaman  in service of  the ship?    overlap.  The  former\nquestion  usually reduces  to  asking:   How  connected with  the\nship's function must  a person's duties be in  order for the mine\nrun of  rights under maritime law to attach?  The latter question\nusually  reduces to  asking:    How  connected  with  the  ship's\nfunction must  the injury-inducing circumstances be  in order for\nsuch  rights to attach?   In our estimation,  the answers to both\nquestions  shed light  upon  the quandary  we face  here, namely,\nwhether  it is necessarily true  that a seaman  in service of the\nvessel instantly loses that status upon discharge.\n\n                                10\n\ninjury  or   illness  occurs  amidst  circumstances   endured  in\n\nfurtherance of, and as  a result of, an employment, the duties of\n\nwhich  help accomplish  the  mission of  a vessel  in navigation.\n\nThis formulation makes clear that, while the right to maintenance\n\nand cure stems from a person's  employment, there is no reason to\n\nassume that  the right and  the employment are  conterminous with\n\neach other.   Indeed, the  decided cases  indicate the  contrary.\n\nSee  Aguilar, 318  U.S.  at 730  (explaining  that the  right  to\n            \n\nmaintenance  and  cure  arises  \"as an  incident  of  the  marine\n\nemployer-employee  relationship\");  Cortes  v. Baltimore  Insular\n                                                                 \n\nLine, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101990\"><a href=\"/opinion/101990/cortes-v-baltimore-insular-line-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 371 (1932) (explaining that  the right\n          \n\nto maintenance and cure  \"has its source  in a relation which  is\n\ncontractual in origin\").\n\n                                D\n\n          A  third pylon  on which  our holding rests  reflects a\n\npolicy  judgment.     We   recognize  that  the   possibility  of\n\nmaintenance  and cure attaching  will end in  most instances when\n\nthe  employment  relationship  expires.     But,  this  need  not\n\ninvariably  be the  case.  We  are of  the opinion  that taking a\n\nmechanical  approach, as  appellee urges,  would as  a matter  of\n\npolicy  be incompatible  with  the Court's  repeated eschewal  of\n\nsharp-edged rules limiting seamen's rights.  See, e.g., Wilander,\n                                                                \n\n111 S.  Ct. at 817-18; Desper v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104945\"><a href=\"/opinion/104945/desper-v-starved-rock-ferry-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n                                                       \n\n<span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 190 (1952).\n\n          What  is more, a strict cut-off point of the sort urged\n\nby  appellee  would sometimes  run  at  cross  purposes with  the\n\n                                11\n\nhistorical   antecedents   and   definitional    imperatives   of\n\nmaintenance and cure.  See supra Parts II(B), (C).  We think this\n                                \n\nis so because the life of a seaman requires that he be drawn into\n\nthe  separate world of the ship and subjected to the unique risks\n\npresent therein.  If he is  terminated while still in that realm,\n\nthe separation  and its risks    which are,  after all,  the twin\n\nrationales for providing maintenance and cure    do not instantly\n\nevaporate.   Nor,  therefore, does  the seaman's  persona change,\n\nlike Cinderella  at the stroke of twelve,  from a servitor of the\n\nship  to a  landlubbing interloper.   Rather, the  title \"seaman\"\n\nmust remain attached  at least until the  individual has finished\n\nhis  shipboard tasks  (unless duly  relieved of  them) and  had a\n\nreasonable chance  to  exit  from the  maritime  realm,  or,  put\n\nanother way, for so long as the twin  rationales remain in force.\n\nJust as the Court deemed Aguilar  a seaman in service of the ship\n\nbecause the risks inherent in his  situation were necessitated by\n\nthe ship's  business, see Aguilar,  318 U.S. at  734, so,  too, a\n                                 \n\nperson  cashiered  while  on  board a  vessel  remains  a  seaman\n\nfurthering its purposes at least until he is afforded  reasonable\n\ntime and opportunity for disembarkation.\n\n                                E\n\n          The  last pylon on which our holding rests is hewn from\n\nthe  caselaw.   There is  a venerable  court of  appeals decision\n\ndirectly on  point in  which the  plaintiff,  after being  fired,\n\ninjured  himself while leaving the ship.  The Fourth Circuit held\n\nthat\n\n                                12\n\n          the  obligation  of   the  ship  to   furnish\n          maintenance  and  cure attaches  to accidents\n          which  happen in  the brief  interval between\n          the time  a seaman  is paid off  and formally\n          discharged and the  subsequent time at which,\n          in   ordinary   course,   he  actually   gets\n          physically away from  her.  He went on her as\n          a seaman, and for the  purpose in hand he did\n          not cease to be one  until he was safely  off\n          her.\n\nThe Michael Tracy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span>  <span class=\"page\">680</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 681 (4th Cir. 1924).   We believe\n                 \n\nthat  this statement  of  the law  continues  to shine  brightly,\n\nundimmed by the passage of time.6\n\n          We  discern   further   decisional  support   for   our\n\nconclusion in  the closely related area  of workers' compensation\n\nlaw.  Although statutes  differ from state to state,  the general\n\nrule  stipulates   that  \"coverage   is  not   automatically  and\n\ninstantaneously  terminated  by the  firing  or  quitting of  the\n\nemployee\" but extends for a reasonable period thereafter so  that\n\nthe  employee  may  \"wind[]  up   his  affairs  and  leave[]  the\n\npremises.\"  1A Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmen's Compensation  \n                                                               \n\n26.10  (1993) (collecting  cases);  see also  id.     26:30-26:40\n                                                 \n\n(indicating that  a \"reasonable period\" incident  to severance of\n\nemployment encompasses  time to pick  up a paycheck  and retrieve\n\n                    \n\n     6B.G.T. suggests  that Fisher v. Cleveland  Cliffs Iron Co.,\n                                                                \n1975 A.M.C. 1570  (W.D. Pa. 1975), a  case in which the  district\ncourt abjured the rule of Tracy, is the beacon by which we should\n                               \nsteer.   We  disagree.   First, Fisher's  reasoning depends  upon\n                                      \nstatements  (dicta  in  decisions  and  passages  in  commentary)\ntreating  with unrelated questions.  See id. at 1577-78.  Second,\n                                            \nnone of this  rumination actually rules out  recovery by recently\nfired employees.  See id.  On the whole, Fisher is unsupported by\n                                               \nthe authorities upon which it purports to rely.  Hence,  we, like\nthe commentators, see,  e.g., 2 Norris, supra,    26.31, consider\n                                             \nTracy more persuasive.\n     \n\n                                13\n\npersonal effects);  Elmer H. Blair, Reference  Guide to Workmen's\n                                                                 \n\nCompensation     5:03 (1974  &amp; Supp.  1993)  (\"When a  workman is\n            \n\ndischarged,  the right to compensation as an employee is not lost\n\nuntil he has  had a reasonable  time to collect  his pay and  his\n\npersonal belongings, and leave the premises of his employer.\").\n\n          We think  the  presence  of  this  \"reasonable  period\"\n\nstandard  in  workers'  compensation   law  takes  on  a  special\n\nsignificance  for  our  purposes   because  an  injured  seaman's\n\nentitlement to maintenance  and cure is widely  thought to impose\n\n\"a  broader  liability  than  that imposed  by  modern  workmen's\n\ncompensation statutes.\"   Aguilar, 318  U.S. at 732;  see also  2\n                                                              \n\nNorris,  supra,   26:40 (\"Maintenance and  cure under the general\n              \n\nmaritime law is far more liberal in its application than are most\n\nof the present workmen's compensation acts.\").\n\n                                F\n\n          We  need  go  no further.    The  four  pylons we  have\n\ndescribed  form  an  integrated  foundation.   Building  on  that\n\nfoundation, we hold that  the right to maintenance and  cure made\n\navailable by general  maritime law to  seamen injured or  falling\n\nill while in service of the ship may attach after  termination of\n\nemployment so long as the triggering event takes place within the\n\nperiod of time  reasonably needed for the accomplishment of tasks\n\nin  general furtherance of  winding up the  seaman's employment  \n\nthe  prototypical  examples   being  removing  one's  belongings,\n\nquitting the ship,  or implementing  direct orders  given at  the\n\ntime of discharge.\n\n                                14\n\n          In  the case  at hand, the  magistrate judge  applied a\n\ndifferent, incorrect legal standard.  Moreover, the record is not\n\nsufficiently developed to allow us to resolve the  controversy by\n\nregrouping the available  findings of fact along the proper legal\n\nmatrix.7   The  case must,  therefore,  be remanded  for  further\n\nconsideration in  light of  this opinion,  and  for such  further\n\nproceedings as may be required.  Although it is apparent that the\n\nentire case need not be retried, we in no way intend to limit the\n\nscope of the magistrate judge's inquiry on remand, but leave that\n\nto  her informed discretion.  In the  same vein, we see no reason\n\nfor the interposition of a new trier.\n\nVacated and remanded.

(1) The record\nis inscrutable with  regard to whether LeBlanc,  after the second\nimbroglio,  alighted from  the  RESOLUTE, and  then returned,  or\nwhether he  remained on board.   (2) There is some  dubiety as to\nwhether LeBlanc, at the  time of his injury,  was carrying out  a\ndirect order  to remove his gear  from the ship.   The magistrate\nmade  no clear finding  on either point, nor  did she address the\nquestion of  when LeBlanc's injury  occurred with respect  to the\nreasonable  period  of time  needed  to  wind  up his  legitimate\nbusiness on board the RESOLUTE.\n\n                                15\n</pre>",
