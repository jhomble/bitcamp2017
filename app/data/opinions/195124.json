Howard,  Attorney General,  and  Christopher  P.\n                                                               \nReid, Attorney, Civil Bureau, on brief for appellees.\n  \n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n          Per Curiam.   Plaintiff appellant, pro  se, appeals\n                    \n\nthe dismissal of his civil rights complaint under 28 U.S.C.  \n\n1915(d).  Plaintiff  is currently serving a 7-1/2  year to 15\n\nyear sentence in the New Hampshire State Prison following his\n\nguilty plea to crimes he describes only as sex offenses.  The\n\ngist  of plaintiff's  complaint, brought  under  42 U.S.C.   \n\n1983,   is  that  New   Hampshire's  sex  offense   laws  are\n\nunconstitutional  because  they  permit  a  defendant  to  be\n\nconvicted  solely  on  the  uncorroborated testimony  of  the\n\nvictim.     Plaintiff  claims   that  the   state's  statutes\n\nfacilitate wrongful convictions on insufficient evidence.  He\n\nstates  that  evidence in  his  own case  was  falsified, and\n\nimplies  that the  state's laws  were at  fault. He  names as\n\ndefendants  the  State  of New  Hampshire,  the  Hillsborough\n\nPolice   Department,   various  state,   county   and  police\n\nofficials, a law firm and  two attorneys who represented  him\n\nin his  criminal case.   Defendants are variously  accused of\n\nwrongful activities  connected to enforcement  of the state's\n\nlaws  generally,   or  to   plaintiff's   criminal  case   in\n\nparticular.   The  complaint requests  both  equitable relief\n\n(release from confinement) and damages.\n\n          Because plaintiff is  proceeding in forma pauperis,\n\nthe  magistrate  undertook   a  preliminary  review  of   the\n\ncomplaint  prior  to completing  service.   See  28  U.S.C.  \n                                               \n\n1915(d); Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 327-28 (1989) (to\n                            \n\n                             -2-\n\navoid  wasteful litigation,  under    1915(d)  the court  may\n\ndismiss  claims  which are  based  on  indisputably meritless\n\nlegal  theories  or  delusional  factual  scenarios).     The\n\nmagistrate found that the complaint failed to state a legally\n\ncognizable claim under 42 U.S.C.   1983 for  several reasons,\n\nand  ordered  plaintiff  to  file  an  amendment  curing  the\n\ndefects,  or  face  dismissal of  the  complaint.   Plaintiff\n\nobjected to  the report,  stating in part  that he  wished to\n\nproceed under 42 U.S.C.   1985(3), not   1983.   The district\n\njudge reviewed  the  matter, and  affirmed  the  magistrate's\n\norder.  Plaintiff  then complied with the order  by filing an\n\namendment under 42 U.S.C.   1985(3).  The amendment, too, was\n\nlegally deficient,  but the magistrate afforded plaintiff yet\n\nanother  opportunity  to  amend.    When  plaintiff's  second\n\namendment failed to  cure any of  the defects, the  complaint\n\nwas dismissed.    See Forte v.  Sullivan, 935 F.2d 1,  3 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1991) (a district court  may dismiss a complaint under  \n\n1915(d) following notice  and an  opportunity to  amend in  a\n\nmanner that would  satisfy the procedural safeguards  of Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)).  We affirm.  \n\n          The gravamen  of the complaint is an  attack on the\n\nvalidity  of plaintiff's conviction.  The district court thus\n\ncorrectly held  that the  sole available  federal remedy  for\n\nobtaining  release from  state custody  is a  writ  of habeas\n\ncorpus, which a plaintiff may seek after exhausting his state\n\n                             -3-\n\nremedies.  Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 488-90 (1973).\n                               \n\nAs plaintiff's amendments  showed that he had  yet to exhaust\n\nhis state  remedies,  and was  simultaneously pursuing  state\n\nhabeas relief, dismissal of plaintiff's equitable claims  was\n\nrequired.  Preiser, 411 U.S. at 490-94, 500.       \n                  \n\n          As  to the  damages  claims,  they  were  correctly\n\ndismissed  because, soley as  a matter  of federal  law, they\n\nfailed  to state  claims legally  cognizable  in the  federal\n\nforum. Though  the pleading  is vague,  its overriding  legal\n\ndefects  are clear.  Cf. Bettencourt v. Board of Registration\n                                                             \n\nin Medicine, 904  F.2d 772 (1st Cir.  1990) (although Deakins\n                                                             \n\nv.  Monaghan, 484  U.S. 193  (1988)  ordinarily requires  the\n            \n\ncourt  to  stay  federal  monetary  claims  which  cannot  be\n\nasserted in  a parallel  state proceeding,  dismissal may  be\n\naffirmed where  there are adequate independent  legal grounds\n\nfor the dismissal).    \n\n           As the  district  court held,  first,  the  claims\n\nasserted  under      1985(3)  cannot   be  sustained  because\n\nplaintiff  does not  allege, but  actually  denies, that  the\n\ndefendants' actions  were directed against a protected class.\n\nSee Bray v. Alexandria Women's  Health Clinic, 113 S. Ct. 753\n                                             \n\n(1993).  Second, to the  extent that plaintiff is complaining\n\nof  constitutional   deprivations   caused   by   the   state\n\ndefendants' misuse of  state laws and procedures, there is no\n\ncause of action under   1983 until and unless the state fails\n\n                             -4-\n\nto  provide a  suitable postdeprivation  remedy.   Hudson  v.\n                                                         \n\nPalmer,  468  U.S.  517,  533  (1984).    Third,  plaintiff's\n      \n\nseparate claims  against  his private  attorneys for  alleged\n\nmalpractice  are not cognizable under  1983 because there are\n\nno facts  suggesting that their  conduct was under  \"color of\n\nstate  law.\"   Polk County  v.  Dodson, 454  U.S. 312  (1981)\n                                      \n\n(public defender is not state  actor for purposes of   1983);\n\nMalachowski v.  Keene, 787 F.2d  704, 710 (1st  Cir.) (court-\n                     \n\nappointed private attorney does not act under \"color of state\n\nlaw\"), cert.  denied, 479 U.S.  828 (1986).  Finally,  to the\n                    \n\nextent that  plaintiff seeks to  ground a cause of  action on\n\nthe  alleged  constitutional insufficiency  of  a state  rule\n\nallowing convictions based  solely on victims' uncorroborated\n\ntestimony, he has no standing to challenge the practice under\n\n  1983.   Plaintiff states that his own  conviction was based\n\non his guilty plea, not some insufficient quantum of evidence\n\nintroduced at  a trial.   See Adams  v. Watson,  No. 93-1068,\n                                              \n\n1993  WL 497387  at  *2  (1st  Cir.  Dec.  8,  1993)  (as  an\n\n\"irreducible   constitutional  minimum,\"   the  doctrine   of\n\nstanding  requires that the  plaintiff show an  actual injury\n\ncaused by the challenged illegality and plaintiff must have a\n\ndirect stake in the outcome of the dispute) (citing cases). \n\n          For  the  reasons  stated,  the judgment  below  is\n\naffirmed.     As   plaintiff  suffered   no  prejudice   from\n        \n\n                             -5-\n\ndefendant's late filing,  plaintiff's motions challenging the\n\ntimeliness of defendant's brief are denied.       \n                                          \n\n                             -6-\n",

As plaintiff's amendments showed that he had yet to exhaust his state remedies, and was simultaneously pursuing state habeas relief, dismissal of plaintiff's equitable claims was required.   Preiser, 411 U.S. at 490-94, 500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the damages claims, they were correctly dismissed because, soley as a matter of federal law, they failed to state claims legally cognizable in the federal forum.  Though the pleading is vague, its overriding legal defects are clear.   Cf. Bettencourt v. Board of Registration in Medicine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542856\"><a href=\"/opinion/542856/paul-e-bettencourt-md-v-board-of-registration-in-medicine-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1990) (although  Deakins v. Monaghan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111975\"><a href=\"/opinion/111975/deakins-v-monaghan/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span> (1988) ordinarily requires the court to stay federal monetary claims which cannot be asserted in a parallel state proceeding, dismissal may be affirmed where there are adequate independent legal grounds for the dismissal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court held, first, the claims asserted under Sec. 1985(3) cannot be sustained because plaintiff does not allege, but actually denies, that the defendants' actions were directed against a protected class.  See  Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112805\"><a href=\"/opinion/112805/bray-v-alexandria-womens-health-clinic/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span> (1993).  Second, to the extent that plaintiff is complaining of constitutional deprivations caused by the state defendants' misuse of state laws and procedures, there is no cause of action under Sec. 1983 until and unless the state fails to provide a suitable postdeprivation remedy.   Hudson v. Palmer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111252\"><a href=\"/opinion/111252/hudson-v-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 533 (1984).  Third, plaintiff's separate claims against his private attorneys for alleged malpractice are not cognizable under Sec. 1983 because there are no facts suggesting that their conduct was under \"color of state law.\"   Polk County v. Dodson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110589\"><a href=\"/opinion/110589/polk-county-v-dodson/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span> (1981) (public defender is not state actor for purposes of Sec. 1983);   Malachowski v. Keene, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468093\"><a href=\"/opinion/468093/henry-malachowski-and-julia-malachowski-v-city-of-keene/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span>, 710 (1st Cir.)  (court-appointed private attorney does not act under \"color of state law\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></span> (1986).  Finally, to the extent that plaintiff seeks to ground a cause of action on the alleged constitutional insufficiency of a state rule allowing convictions based solely on victims' uncorroborated testimony, he has no standing to challenge the practice under Sec. 1983.  Plaintiff states that his own conviction was based on his guilty plea, not some insufficient quantum of evidence introduced at a trial.  See Adams v. Watson, No. 93-1068, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">497387</span></span> at * 2 (1st Cir.  Dec. 8, 1993) (as an \"irreducible constitutional minimum,\" the doctrine of standing requires that the plaintiff show an actual injury caused by the challenged illegality and plaintiff must have a direct stake in the outcome of the dispute) (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, the judgment below is affirmed.  As plaintiff suffered no prejudice from defendant's late filing, plaintiff's motions challenging the timeliness of defendant's brief are denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
