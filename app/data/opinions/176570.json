Aida M. Delgado-Colón, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n               Howard and Thompson, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Geoffrey M. Raux, Michael J. Tuteur, Matthew A. Ambros and\nFoley & Lardner LLP, on brief for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Julia M.\nMeconiates, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-\nVélez, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           October 5, 2010\n\f            Per Curiam. This is Rafael Lara-Joglar's direct appeal\n\nfrom his conviction and sentence for his participation in a multi-\n\ndefendant drug-trafficking conspiracy.            The defendant's principal\n\narguments on appeal are that his guilty plea was involuntary and\n\nunknowing    and    that   his        plea    agreement    as   a    whole   was\n\nunconscionable.     We will discuss those arguments before addressing\n\nthe enforceability of the appeal waiver in his plea agreement\n\nbecause, if the guilty plea or the plea agreement as a whole is\n\ninvalid, then the appeal waiver provision of the agreement is\n\nobviously invalid as well.\n\n            The parties disagree as to the applicable standard of\n\nreview of these claims.         The government argues that, because the\n\ndefendant   did    not   seek    to    withdraw    his    guilty    plea   before\n\nsentencing, this court's review of the validity of his plea is only\n\nfor plain error.     The defendant's opening brief is silent on the\n\nstandard of review (in violation of Rule 28(a)(9)(B) of the Federal\n\nRules of Appellate Procedure), but his reply brief argues that,\n\neven though the claims were not preserved, a de novo standard of\n\nreview applies.    Because we conclude that the guilty plea and plea\n\nagreement were valid under either standard, we need not resolve\n\nthat disagreement.\n\n            The major common premise of this group of arguments is\n\nthat although the defendant's own participation in the underlying\n\noffense was allegedly limited, he was charged along with 58 co-\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fdefendants with participating in a drug-trafficking conspiracy\n\ninvolving large amounts of drugs, guns (including machine guns),\n\nand several murders and that the government had massive physical,\n\naudio-visual, and documentary evidence that might unfairly be\n\nattributed to him, especially given the potentially self-serving\n\ntestimony of at least five cooperating witnesses, resulting in a\n\nmuch higher sentence than he received by pleading guilty.          A\n\nfurther allegedly coercive circumstance was the court's summary\n\ndenial of his newly appointed counsel's motion to continue the\n\ntrial after his original counsel was forced to withdraw, due to a\n\nconflict of interest, less than three weeks before trial.         He\n\nargues that those circumstances coerced him into pleading guilty\n\nrather than going to trial and facing the likelihood of \"guilt by\n\nassociation\"; that, in light of those circumstances, the court\n\nshould have taken additional steps to ensure that his plea was\n\nvoluntary and knowing; and that these same circumstances forced him\n\nto accept the government's proposed plea agreement, which he\n\ncharacterizes as \"unconscionable.\"\n\n          \"It cannot be gainsaid that a defendant's decision to\n\nenter a guilty plea is sometimes influenced by his assessment of\n\nthe prosecution's case.\"   Ferrara v. United States, 456 F.3d 278,\n\n291 (1st Cir. 2006).   But that common motive for pleading guilty\n\n\"cannot form the basis for a finding of involuntariness,\" unless\n\n\"the   defendant's   misapprehension   of   the   strength   of   the\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fgovernment's case results from some particularly pernicious form of\n\nimpermissible conduct.\"       Id.   The allegedly improper conduct that\n\nthe defendant attributes to the government here is primarily that\n\nit brought a multi-defendant conspiracy prosecution.             That alone,\n\nof course, is not impermissible.         While various courts, including\n\nthis one, have recognized the risks of such prosecutions--namely,\n\nthat   the   jury   will    find    individual,     presumptively     innocent\n\ndefendants guilty by virtue of their association with their more\n\nobviously culpable co-defendants--they have done so primarily in\n\nthe context of requiring that certain safeguards be imposed to\n\nprevent such risks from being realized.           See, e.g., Richardson v.\n\nMarsh, 481 U.S. 200, 211 (1987) (holding that where a nontestifying\n\nco-defendant's      out-of-court       confession      does    not    facially\n\nincriminate another defendant, it can be admitted in a joint trial\n\nonly with a limiting instruction and redacted to eliminate any\n\nreference to the other defendant's existence); Bruton v. United\n\nStates,   391   U.S.   123,   135-36    (1968)      (holding   that   where   a\n\nnontestifying co-defendant's out-of-court confession does facially\n\nincriminate another defendant, it cannot be admitted in a joint\n\ntrial even with a limiting instruction); United States v. Ofray-\n\nCampos,   534   F.3d   1,   24-31    (1st   Cir.)    (vacating   defendants'\n\nconvictions where the court told the jury, without any limiting\n\ninstruction, that 37 co-defendants were in prison for participating\n\nin the alleged conspiracy), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 588 (2008).\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f              Although the defendant claims that he should have been\n\nmade aware of those safeguards at his change-of-plea hearing, no\n\nsuch detailed description was required. Rule 11 requires only that\n\nthe court inform the defendant of \"his right at trial to confront\n\nand cross-examine witnesses,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(E), which\n\nhas been found to be satisfied where the court merely \"touched on\"\n\nthat right and the defendant expressed no confusion. United States\n\nv. Moriarty, 429 F.3d 1012, 1020 n.5 (11th Cir. 2005).                      The\n\nConstitution requires even less.             Ward, 518 F.3d at 83 & n.13.\n\nHere, the court not only mentioned those rights but explained them,\n\nat some length, in layman's language.            That explanation was more\n\nthan sufficient.\n\n              The defendant further objects to the court's use of the\n\nwords \"anyone\" or \"someone\" as being too narrow to include the\n\npossibility that \"it was the coercive circumstances--brought on by\n\nthe   Government's    tactics--that      compelled    [him]   to   accept   the\n\noppressive terms in the plea agreement.\"               However, even in a\n\npotentially more coercive, package-plea situation, which was not\n\npresent here, the general inquiry as to whether \"anyone\" forced the\n\ndefendant to plead guilty has been held sufficient.            United States\n\nv. Mescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir. 2004); cf. United\n\nStates   v.    Martinez-Molina,   64    F.3d   719,   734   (1st   Cir.   1995)\n\n(finding inquiry as to whether the \"prosecutor\" forced a defendant\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fto plead guilty insufficiently broad to cover the possibility that\n\nhe was coerced to do so by his co-defendants).\n\n          The final allegedly \"coercive circumstance\" that the\n\ndefendant points to is that, less than three weeks before the\n\nscheduled trial date, the court summarily denied newly appointed\n\ndefense   counsel's      motion   for        a    continuance     of    the    trial.\n\nOrdinarily, denial of a continuance of trial is within the broad\n\nrange of the district court's discretion, United States v. Mangual-\n\nSantiago, 562 F.3d 411, 429-30 (1st Cir. 2009); but an unexplained\n\ndenial may be an abuse of that discretion, id. at 430-31.\n\n          Here, although the court initially gave no reasons for\n\ndenying the motion, it later explained that it had appointed this\n\nparticular    attorney    because       he       had    experience     in     criminal\n\nlitigation and knowledge of criminal law in general and of this\n\ncase in particular (through his earlier, brief representation of\n\nanother defendant) and would therefore be able to \"go through the\n\nevidence in the case immediately, and make an accurate assessment\n\nof where [the defendant's] case stood in terms of the complete\n\nscenario of the case\" and could do so \"rapidly.\"                            Denying a\n\ncontinuance    in   those    circumstances             was   within    the     court's\n\ndiscretion.\n\n          As to the unconscionability of the plea agreement, the\n\ndefendant alleges that the government refused to negotiate the\n\nterms of the plea agreement with him and that the terms it offered\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fwere unreasonably favorable to the government.               Those allegations\n\nare unsupported by the record, which indicates that the parties\n\nengaged in extensive, good-faith plea negotiations and that the\n\nterms of the final agreement, far from being \"unconscionable,\" were\n\nhighly favorable to the defendant in that, absent the agreement, he\n\nwas exposed to a mandatory minimum of ten rather than five years\n\nand a maximum of a life sentence rather than the 156-month sentence\n\njointly recommended in the agreement, the best deal offered to any\n\nsimilarly situated defendant.           The plea agreement and the guilty\n\nplea   in    general   were    therefore      not    so    coercive   as    to   be\n\ninvoluntary.\n\n             The   threshold    issue    as    to    the    remainder      of    the\n\ndefendant's appellate arguments is the enforceability of his appeal\n\nwaiver; if it is enforceable, then we need not--and should not--\n\nreach the other issues that the defendant raises on appeal. United\n\nStates v. Borrero-Acevedo, 533 F.3d 11, 18 (1st Cir.) (\"[A]n\n\ninquiry into the merits is exactly what a waiver of appeal blocks.\"\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 587\n\n(2008).     We will therefore address that issue next.\n\n             Presentence waivers of appeal are enforceable if the\n\nwaiver was \"knowing\" and \"voluntary\" and if enforcing it would not\n\nresult in a \"miscarriage of justice.\"               United States v.       Teeter,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f257 F.3d 14, 24-25 (1st Cir. 2001).1        In determining whether the\n\nwaiver was knowing and voluntary, we evaluate whether the written\n\nplea agreement \"contains a clear statement elucidating the waiver\n\nand   delineating   its   scope\"    and   whether   the   district   court\n\n\"inquire[d] specifically at the change-of-plea hearing into any\n\nwaiver of appellate rights.\"       Id. at 24; see also Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(b)(1)(N) (requiring such an inquiry).\n\n           Here, the defendant does not challenge the clarity of the\n\nwritten waiver, which provided that if the court \"accepts this Plea\n\nAgreement and sentences [the defendant] according to its terms,\n\nconditions and recommendations, [he] waives and surrenders his\n\nright to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.\"        Nor could\n\nhe successfully mount such a challenge since we have repeatedly\n\nupheld the clarity of nearly identically worded waivers.              See,\n\ne.g., González-Colón, 582 F.3d at 127; United States v. De-La-Cruz\n\nCastro, 299 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           Rather, in arguing that the appeal waiver itself was\n\nunknowing and involuntary, the defendant focuses on the alleged\n\ninsufficiency of the court's explanation of the waiver at the\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      Because the government does not invoke the plain-error\nstandard that would otherwise apply to an unpreserved challenge to\nthe enforceability of an appeal waiver, Borrero-Acevedo, 533 F.3d\nat 13, we apply the Teeter standards without the plain-error\noverlay. See United States v. Edelen, 539 F.3d 83, 85 n.1 (1st\nCir.), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 427 (2008); United States v.\nChandler, 534 F.3d 45, 49 n.3 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                    -8-\n\fchange-of-plea hearing and at sentencing.       The record of those\n\nhearings, however, reveals no such deficiencies.\n\n          At the change-of-plea hearing, the court specifically\n\nbrought the appeal waiver to the attention of the defendant and his\n\nco-defendant, whose agreement apparently contained an identically\n\nworded waiver.     The court correctly explained the waiver, as\n\napplied to each defendant's circumstances, as follows:\n\n                 [I]f I sentence you Mr. Lara to 156\n                 months and Mr. Aponte if I sentence\n                 you to 108 months concurrent, then\n                 you will accept that as the final\n                 sentence. You will not be asking a\n                 higher Court to review what I have\n                 done or how I made the analysis of\n                 the sentencing guidelines or what\n                 w[ere] the factors that l[ed] to any\n                 sentence, to that sentence that I\n                 imposed. Which means this sentence\n                 will be firm and final.\n\nId.\n\n          The    defendant   argues    that,   by   using   the   word\n\n\"concurrent,\" the court created confusion as to whether Lara's\n\nrecommended 60-month sentence on Count 7 would be concurrent with\n\nor consecutive to his 96-month sentence on Count 1. However, since\n\nthe court specifically referred to a sentence of 156 months for\n\nLara, it was clear that the number 156 referred to the total\n\nrecommended sentence on both counts (96 plus 60), and that the word\n\n\"concurrent\" applied only to co-defendant Aponte's recommended\n\nsentence, which was previously described as concurrent with his\n\nsentences on related federal and state offenses. Not only did Lara\n\n                                 -9-\n\fexpress no confusion with that explanation, any inference that he\n\nwas   confused   is   precluded   by   the   court's   earlier   repeated\n\nexplanations that the mandatory 60-month sentence on Count 7 would\n\nbe consecutive to the parties' recommended 96-month sentence on\n\nCount 1 and by the defendant's own accurate explanation of the\n\nmeaning of \"consecutive\" in his own words.\n\n           The defendant goes on to argue that \"[t]he waters were\n\nfurther muddied\" by the court's advice, at sentencing, that \"were\n\n[he] to appeal the judgment in this case [he had] ten days, [he\n\ncould] ask attorney Vega to file, [he could] do it pro se or [he\n\ncould] ask the Clerk of Court to file it on [his] behalf\" and that\n\n\"[w]ere [he] to pursue an appeal, Mr. Vega could do it or any other\n\nattorney from the Court[, and that,] [i]n addition[,] [he could]\n\nask for authorization to proceed in forma pauperis\" (emphases\n\nadded). That conditional advice, however, was offered only \"out of\n\nan abundance of caution\" and was immediately prefaced by the\n\nfollowing statement (omitted from the defendant's brief):           \"The\n\nsentence [the court] imposed [w]as pursuant to the plea agreement\n\nstipulated between the parties so that I take it that the waiver of\n\nappeal is triggered and that waiver is totally enforceable.\"\n\nNeither the defendant nor his attorney objected to or sought\n\nclarification of that statement.         In that context, nothing the\n\ncourt said at sentencing \"muddied\" its previous clear explanation\n\nof the appeal waiver at the change-of-plea hearing.          Rather, in\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\ffulfilling    its    obligation     under     Rule   35(j)(1)      to   advise    the\n\ndefendant of \"any right to appeal,\" the court did precisely what we\n\nprescribed    in    these   circumstances,      namely,      to    be   \"especially\n\ncareful in its choice of words, taking pains to explain to the\n\ndefendant that h[is] right to appeal [wa]s circumscribed by h[is]\n\npreexisting    waiver.\"       Teeter,    257    F.3d   at    25.        The   court's\n\ncomments, taken as a whole, thus fell far short of the \"blanket\n\nassurance    about   the    right   to   appeal\"     that    we    have   cautioned\n\nagainst. Id. Therefore, the defendant's arguments that his waiver\n\nof appeal was unknowing are unavailing.\n\n            The defendant further faults the district court for\n\nfailing to inquire separately as to the voluntariness of the appeal\n\nwaiver (in addition to asking whether \"anyone forced [him] or\n\ncompelled [him] in any way2 to accept the terms and conditions\" of\n\nthe plea agreement; whether \"someone forced [him] in any way or\n\nmanner . . . to accept [the government's] version of facts\"; and,\n\nmore generally, whether \"someone in any way or fashion forced [him]\n\nto make the decision of pleading guilty\").                  That claim for more\n\nspecificity fails.\n\n            \"Although       specific     attention      to        the     issue   of\n\nvoluntariness in any plea proceeding is highly desirable, there is\n\n\n     2\n      The phrase \"in any way\" was misleadingly omitted from the\ndefendant's brief. That omission coupled with the one noted above\nleads us to remind counsel of their responsibility of candor to the\ncourt. See Model Rules of Prof'l Conduct R. 3.3; Amstar Corp. v.\nEnvirotech Corp., 730 F.2d 1476, 1486 (Fed. Cir. 1984).\n\n                                       -11-\n\fno specific script that must be followed.\"     Ward, 518 F.3d at 86.\n\nThere is no requirement in Rule 11 or otherwise that the court\n\nspecifically ask whether a defendant's appeal waiver was voluntary;\n\nRule 11(b)(1)(N) requires only that the court determine whether a\n\ndefendant \"understands\" the terms of any such waiver, which was\n\ndone here.    Although Rule 11 does require the court to \"address the\n\ndefendant personally in open court and determine that the plea is\n\nvoluntary,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(2) (emphasis added), even that\n\ngeneral inquiry is not constitutionally mandated.     Ward, 518 F.3d\n\nat 82.   Moreover, although not required to do so, the court here\n\ndid ask the defendant whether \"anyone forced or compelled [him] in\n\nany way to accept the terms and conditions of this contract that\n\n[he had] made with the government,\" and that question immediately\n\nfollowed the discussion of the appeal waiver.\n\n             Because the first two Teeter factors are thus satisfied,\n\nthe only remaining potential barrier to enforcing the appeal waiver\n\nis if doing so would \"work a miscarriage of justice.\"    Teeter, 257\n\nF.3d at 25.    But the defendant's opening brief is virtually silent\n\non that point; the only allusions to that standard are in a\n\nparenthetical following a case citation and in a footnote.       His\n\nreply brief cites the exception but develops no argument as to how\n\nit applies here.     By not directly making a miscarriage-of-justice\n\nargument in his opening brief and belatedly mentioning but not\n\ndeveloping it in his reply brief, the defendant arguably waived the\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fapplication of that exception. United States v. Hall, 557 F.3d 15,\n\n20 n.3 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 2849 (2009); United\n\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n          Nevertheless, applying the relevant factors, including\n\n\"'the clarity of the alleged error[s], [their] character and\n\ngravity, [their] impact on the defendant, any possible prejudice to\n\nthe government, and the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in\n\nthe result,'\" United States v. González-Colón, 582 F.3d 124, 129\n\n(1st Cir. 2009) (quoting United States v. Gil-Quezada, 445 F.3d 33,\n\n37 (1st Cir. 2006)), we have considered whether foreclosure of\n\neither of the remaining arguments raised on appeal3 would be so\n\nunjust as to satisfy the appropriately demanding miscarriage-of-\n\njustice standard, and we have concluded that no such injustice\n\nwould result.\n\n          In sum, the defendant's guilty plea and plea agreement\n\nwere valid, his appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary, and\n\nenforcing the waiver to preclude his remaining arguments on appeal\n\nwould not work a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, the district\n\ncourt's judgment is affirmed.4    See 1st Cir.

This is Rafael Lara-Joglar's direct appeal\n\nfrom his conviction and sentence for his participation in a multi-\n\ndefendant drug-trafficking conspiracy.            The defendant's principal\n\narguments on appeal are that his guilty plea was involuntary and\n\nunknowing    and    that   his        plea    agreement    as   a    whole   was\n\nunconscionable.     We will discuss those arguments before addressing\n\nthe enforceability of the appeal waiver in his plea agreement\n\nbecause, if the guilty plea or the plea agreement as a whole is\n\ninvalid, then the appeal waiver provision of the agreement is\n\nobviously invalid as well.\n\n            The parties disagree as to the applicable standard of\n\nreview of these claims.         The government argues that, because the\n\ndefendant   did    not   seek    to    withdraw    his    guilty    plea   before\n\nsentencing, this court's review of the validity of his plea is only\n\nfor plain error.     The defendant's opening brief is silent on the\n\nstandard of review (in violation of Rule 28(a)(9)(B) of the Federal\n\nRules of Appellate Procedure), but his reply brief argues that,\n\neven though the claims were not preserved, a de novo standard of\n\nreview applies.    Because we conclude that the guilty plea and plea\n\nagreement were valid under either standard, we need not resolve\n\nthat disagreement.\n\n            The major common premise of this group of arguments is\n\nthat although the defendant's own participation in the underlying\n\noffense was allegedly limited, he was charged along with 58 co-\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fdefendants with participating in a drug-trafficking conspiracy\n\ninvolving large amounts of drugs, guns (including machine guns),\n\nand several murders and that the government had massive physical,\n\naudio-visual, and documentary evidence that might unfairly be\n\nattributed to him, especially given the potentially self-serving\n\ntestimony of at least five cooperating witnesses, resulting in a\n\nmuch higher sentence than he received by pleading guilty.          A\n\nfurther allegedly coercive circumstance was the court's summary\n\ndenial of his newly appointed counsel's motion to continue the\n\ntrial after his original counsel was forced to withdraw, due to a\n\nconflict of interest, less than three weeks before trial.         He\n\nargues that those circumstances coerced him into pleading guilty\n\nrather than going to trial and facing the likelihood of \"guilt by\n\nassociation\"; that, in light of those circumstances, the court\n\nshould have taken additional steps to ensure that his plea was\n\nvoluntary and knowing; and that these same circumstances forced him\n\nto accept the government's proposed plea agreement, which he\n\ncharacterizes as \"unconscionable.\"\n\n          \"It cannot be gainsaid that a defendant's decision to\n\nenter a guilty plea is sometimes influenced by his assessment of\n\nthe prosecution's case.\"   Ferrara v.

The record of those\n\nhearings, however, reveals no such deficiencies.\n\n          At the change-of-plea hearing, the court specifically\n\nbrought the appeal waiver to the attention of the defendant and his\n\nco-defendant, whose agreement apparently contained an identically\n\nworded waiver.     The court correctly explained the waiver, as\n\napplied to each defendant's circumstances, as follows:\n\n                 [I]f I sentence you Mr. Lara to 156\n                 months and Mr. Aponte if I sentence\n                 you to 108 months concurrent, then\n                 you will accept that as the final\n                 sentence. You will not be asking a\n                 higher Court to review what I have\n                 done or how I made the analysis of\n                 the sentencing guidelines or what\n                 w[ere] the factors that l[ed] to any\n                 sentence, to that sentence that I\n                 imposed. Which means this sentence\n                 will be firm and final.\n\nId.\n\n          The    defendant   argues    that,   by   using   the   word\n\n\"concurrent,\" the court created confusion as to whether Lara's\n\nrecommended 60-month sentence on Count 7 would be concurrent with\n\nor consecutive to his 96-month sentence on Count 1. However, since\n\nthe court specifically referred to a sentence of 156 months for\n\nLara, it was clear that the number 156 referred to the total\n\nrecommended sentence on both counts (96 plus 60), and that the word\n\n\"concurrent\" applied only to co-defendant Aponte's recommended\n\nsentence, which was previously described as concurrent with his\n\nsentences on related federal and state offenses. Not only did Lara\n\n                                 -9-\n\fexpress no confusion with that explanation, any inference that he\n\nwas   confused   is   precluded   by   the   court's   earlier   repeated\n\nexplanations that the mandatory 60-month sentence on Count 7 would\n\nbe consecutive to the parties' recommended 96-month sentence on\n\nCount 1 and by the defendant's own accurate explanation of the\n\nmeaning of \"consecutive\" in his own words.\n\n           The defendant goes on to argue that \"[t]he waters were\n\nfurther muddied\" by the court's advice, at sentencing, that \"were\n\n[he] to appeal the judgment in this case [he had] ten days, [he\n\ncould] ask attorney Vega to file, [he could] do it pro se or [he\n\ncould] ask the Clerk of Court to file it on [his] behalf\" and that\n\n\"[w]ere [he] to pursue an appeal, Mr. Vega could do it or any other\n\nattorney from the Court[, and that,] [i]n addition[,] [he could]\n\nask for authorization to proceed in forma pauperis\" (emphases\n\nadded). That conditional advice, however, was offered only \"out of\n\nan abundance of caution\" and was immediately prefaced by the\n\nfollowing statement (omitted from the defendant's brief):           \"The\n\nsentence [the court] imposed [w]as pursuant to the plea agreement\n\nstipulated between the parties so that I take it that the waiver of\n\nappeal is triggered and that waiver is totally enforceable.\"\n\nNeither the defendant nor his attorney objected to or sought\n\nclarification of that statement.         In that context, nothing the\n\ncourt said at sentencing \"muddied\" its previous clear explanation\n\nof the appeal waiver at the change-of-plea hearing.          Rather, in\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\ffulfilling    its    obligation     under     Rule   35(j)(1)      to   advise    the\n\ndefendant of \"any right to appeal,\" the court did precisely what we\n\nprescribed    in    these   circumstances,      namely,      to    be   \"especially\n\ncareful in its choice of words, taking pains to explain to the\n\ndefendant that h[is] right to appeal [wa]s circumscribed by h[is]\n\npreexisting    waiver.\"       Teeter,    257    F.3d   at    25.        The   court's\n\ncomments, taken as a whole, thus fell far short of the \"blanket\n\nassurance    about   the    right   to   appeal\"     that    we    have   cautioned\n\nagainst. Id. Therefore, the defendant's arguments that his waiver\n\nof appeal was unknowing are unavailing.\n\n            The defendant further faults the district court for\n\nfailing to inquire separately as to the voluntariness of the appeal\n\nwaiver (in addition to asking whether \"anyone forced [him] or\n\ncompelled [him] in any way2 to accept the terms and conditions\" of\n\nthe plea agreement; whether \"someone forced [him] in any way or\n\nmanner . . . to accept [the government's] version of facts\"; and,\n\nmore generally, whether \"someone in any way or fashion forced [him]\n\nto make the decision of pleading guilty\").                  That claim for more\n\nspecificity fails.\n\n            \"Although       specific     attention      to        the     issue   of\n\nvoluntariness in any plea proceeding is highly desirable, there is\n\n\n     2\n      The phrase \"in any way\" was misleadingly omitted from the\ndefendant's brief.

Although Rule 11 does require the court to \"address the\n\ndefendant personally in open court and determine that the plea is\n\nvoluntary,\" Fed. R. Crim.

Moreover, although not required to do so, the court here\n\ndid ask the defendant whether \"anyone forced or compelled [him] in\n\nany way to accept the terms and conditions of this contract that\n\n[he had] made with the government,\" and that question immediately\n\nfollowed the discussion of the appeal waiver.\n\n             Because the first two Teeter factors are thus satisfied,\n\nthe only remaining potential barrier to enforcing the appeal waiver\n\nis if doing so would \"work a miscarriage of justice.\"    Teeter, 257\n\nF.3d at 25.    But the defendant's opening brief is virtually silent\n\non that point; the only allusions to that standard are in a\n\nparenthetical following a case citation and in a footnote.       His\n\nreply brief cites the exception but develops no argument as to how\n\nit applies here.     By not directly making a miscarriage-of-justice\n\nargument in his opening brief and belatedly mentioning but not\n\ndeveloping it in his reply brief, the defendant arguably waived the\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fapplication of that exception.
