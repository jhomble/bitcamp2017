Pickett, with whom Richard W. Paterniti and\nJackson Lewis LLP were on brief, for appellant.\n\n          Indira Talwani, with whom Ira Sills and Segal, Roitman &\nColeman were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                         March 31, 2003\n\f              LYNCH, Circuit Judge.      JCI Communications, Inc., doing\n\nbusiness as NetVersant-New England, is a telecommunications company\n\nspecializing in network infrastructures.                It signed collective\n\nbargaining agreements at various times with Local 2222 and Local\n\n103, two separate locals of the same international union, the\n\nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (\"International\").\n\nJCI found itself in the cross-fire as to which work assignments\n\nbelonged to which local.        After JCI assigned certain work to Local\n\n2222, Local 103 referred a grievance to arbitration in January\n\n2002.   Local 103 prevailed at arbitration.                 JCI filed suit to\n\nvacate the arbitral award; Local 103 cross-claimed for confirmation\n\nand sought summary judgment.           The district court granted summary\n\njudgment to Local 103 and JCI appealed.              We affirm.\n\n              JCI raises several arguments.          Its two main attacks on\n\nthe judgment are (1) a set of arguments going to the role played by\n\na Jurisdictional Agreement (purportedly between Locals 103 and\n\n2222,   the    International,    and    JCI)   and    (2)   a   claim   that   the\n\narbitrators were biased.        As to the first attack, JCI argues that,\n\ndespite the arbitral award, it was entitled to a trial, following\n\ndiscovery, on the issue of whether the Jurisdictional Agreement\n\ngoverns the relationship between the parties.               It also argues that\n\nthe arbitrators exceeded the scope of their authority when they\n\nconsidered the validity and effect of the Jurisdictional Agreement,\n\nand so the district court erred in not vacating the award under 9\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fU.S.C. § 10(a)(4) (2000).             Second, JCI argues that the industry\n\narbitrators were biased because they worked for JCI's competitors\n\nand so the award should have been vacated under 9 U.S.C. §\n\n10(a)(2).      A common theme runs through all the arguments: that JCI\n\nwishes    to    present   new   evidence      or   argument   to    the   court   to\n\nundermine the arbitral award.           There are very narrow circumstances\n\nin which such a maneuver is permissible; those circumstances are\n\nabsent here.\n\n               The arguments relating to the Jurisdictional Agreement\n\nfail for a number of reasons.                 The district court could not\n\nindependently review the role of the Jurisdictional Agreement\n\nbecause JCI submitted that issue to the arbitral panel and did not\n\nreserve the issue or contest the panel's authority.                  JCI may not,\n\nthen, attempt to get discovery or retry the issue to the court.\n\nThe district court properly confined itself to a review of the\n\npanel's    award    and   to    the    record      before   the    arbitrator;    it\n\nsuccinctly and correctly found no basis for the claim that the\n\narbitrators exceeded their authority.\n\n               As to the bias claim, while a court may, in other\n\ncircumstances, take independent evidence on bias, the district\n\ncourt was correct to       reject this claim.          Here, JCI was on notice\n\nthat the panel would be drawn from members of its own and related\n\nindustries and, as a result, that some of JCI's competitors could\n\nbe the employer representatives on the panel.                     Yet JCI neither\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\finquired about the backgrounds of the arbitrators nor raised the\n\nquestion    of   possible     bias   before    the    arbitral      panel.    Mere\n\nparticipation by arbitrators from the same industry as a party does\n\nnot   present    a   facial   claim    of    \"evident    partiality\"      under   §\n\n10(a)(2).    JCI has not preserved any claim of bias.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            JCI has hired members of both Local 103 and Local 2222\n\nsince at least 1993, when members of both Locals did electrical\n\nwork at the same project site.          JCI entered into a succession of\n\ncollective bargaining agreements (CBAs) with the Locals between\n\n1993 and 2002, and signed the Jurisdictional Agreement in 1998.\n\n            JCI entered into its first CBA with Local 2222 in 1993.\n\nThat agreement expired and JCI entered into another CBA with Local\n\n2222 that was in force from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 1999.1\n\nJCI and Local 2222 did not sign another CBA until May 15, 2002,\n\nmore than three months after the unfavorable arbitral award.\n\n            JCI assented in 1998 to a CBA concluded in 1997 between\n\nan employers association and Local 103.                  In March 1998, the\n\nbusiness manager of Local 103 wrote to the President of JCI\n\npromising   to   \"continue     to    work    with    Local   2222    in   order   to\n\n\n\n      1\n       JCI claims in its Petition to Vacate that the January 1,\n1998 CBA was \"automatically renewed on December 31, 1999.\"\nHowever, the text of that CBA provides that extensions be in\nwriting, and signed by duly authorized representatives of the\nparties. JCI has not provided any such signed agreement (apart\nfrom the new CBA entered into on May 15, 2002).\n\n                                       -4-\n\fformalize a jurisdictional agreement.\" On October 1, 1998, JCI and\n\nLocal 103 executed a Letter of Assent in which JCI recognized the\n\nBoston Chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association\n\n(\"Boston Chapter\") as JCI's collective bargaining representative\n\n\"for all matters contained in or pertaining to [the] current and\n\nany subsequent approved Telecommunications [L]abor [A]greement\n\nbetween the Boston Chapter, N.E.C.A. and Local Union 103, IBEW.\"\n\n(emphasis added).        The Letter was to \"remain in effect until\n\nterminated by the undersigned employer [JCI]\" with adequate written\n\nnotice to the Boston Chapter and Local 103.             JCI never provided\n\nwritten notice of termination to Local 103.\n\n              The   then-current   Telecommunications    Labor    Agreement,\n\nsigned on September 1, 1997, expired on February 29, 2000 and was\n\nreplaced by a succeeding Telecommunications Labor Agreement, dated\n\nMarch    1,   2000.     Both   agreements   recognize   Local    103   as   the\n\nexclusive collective bargaining representative of all employees\n\nperforming a broad range of electrical work.         Both agreements also\n\nprovide that disputes shall be resolved via binding arbitration\n\nbefore a Joint Conference Committee (\"Committee\") consisting of\n\nthree union representatives and three employer representatives.2\n\n\n     2\n       The agreements use the same language:\n     Section 1.04 There shall be a Joint Conference Committee of\nthree (3) representing the Union and three (3) representing the\nEmployer. It shall meet regularly at such stated times as it may\ndecide. However, it shall also meet within forty-eight (48) hours\nwhen notice is given by either party. It shall select its own\nChairman and Secretary.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fThese agreements, like the Letter of Assent, were duly signed by\n\nappropriate representatives of the parties.\n\n           At the heart of this case is a purported \"Jurisdictional\n\nAgreement,\" dated October 2, 1998.        The document, which recognizes\n\nthe   existence   of   \"jurisdictional     issues\"   between   the   Locals\n\n\"regarding telecommunications projects,\" was characterized as an\n\nagreement between Local 103, Local 2222, and JCI.               There are\n\nsignature lines on the agreement for representatives of Local 103,\n\nLocal 2222, JCI, and the International.        Representatives of Local\n\n103 and Local 2222 never signed the agreement.        There are only two\n\nsignatures:   those    of   Frank   Carroll,   the   International    Vice\n\nPresident in charge of the New England region, and a JCI executive.\n\nThe International Constitution provides that only the International\n\n\n     Section 1.05 All grievances or questions in dispute shall be\nadjusted by the duly authorized representatives of each of the\nparties to this Agreement. In the event that these two are unable\nto adjust any matter within 48 hours, they shall refer the same to\nthe Joint Conference Committee.\n     Section 1.06 All matters coming before the Joint Conference\nCommittee shall be decided by majority vote. Four members of the\nCommittee, two from each of the parties hereto, shall be a quorum\nfor the transaction of business, but each party shall have the\nright to cast the full vote of its membership and it shall be\ncounted as though all were present and voting.\n     Section 1.07 Should the Joint Conference Committee fail to\nagree or to adjust any matter, such shall then be referred to the\nCouncil on Industrial Relations for the Electrical Contracting\nIndustry for adjudication. The Council's decision shall be final\nand binding on both parties hereto.\n     Section 1.08 When any matter in dispute has been referred to\nconciliation or arbitration for adjustment, the provisions and\nconditions prevailing prior to the time such matters arose shall\nnot be changed or abrogated until agreement has been reached or a\nruling has been made.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fPresident, or her duly appointed representative, can enter into a\n\nbinding agreement with a company.\n\n           After     it     signed     the    Letter     of   Assent     and    the\n\nJurisdictional Agreement, JCI assigned work to both Locals.                     JCI\n\ncontinued assigning work to Local 2222 after its CBA with Local\n\n2222 expired at the end of 1999.              JCI says Local 2222 agreed to\n\nextend this CBA while the parties negotiated a new one.\n\n           A Boston Chapter contractor filed charges against JCI\n\nalleging   that     it    had     violated   the   Telecommunications          Labor\n\nAgreement by giving work reserved for Local 103 members to members\n\nof Local 2222.     On January 21, 2002, Local 103 referred a grievance\n\nto   the   Committee,       under    the     procedure    set    forth    in     the\n\nTelecommunications         Labor    Agreement,     asserting     that    JCI     was\n\nassigning work covered by that agreement to members of Local 2222.3\n\n           The Committee met on February 4, 2002.               Per the terms of\n\nthe Telecommunications Labor Agreement, the Committee consisted of\n\nthree representatives of Local 103 and three representatives of the\n\nBoston Chapter.          As JCI alleged to the court, but not to the\n\nCommittee,    the        Boston    Chapter    representatives       worked       for\n\ncompetitors of JCI that had in the past lost job bids to JCI.\n\n\n     3\n       Apart from its claim relating to the hiring of members of\nLocal 2222, Local 103 also claimed that at one project site JCI\nimproperly subcontracted work covered by the Telecommunications\nLabor Agreement to Maverick Construction (which may or may not\nemploy electricians from one of the two Locals). JCI stipulated at\nthe hearing that it had violated the Telecommunications Labor\nAgreement in this regard.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fRobert Feldman, Executive Vice President of JCI, claims that JCI\n\ndid not learn that the Boston Chapter arbitrators were employed by\n\ncompetitors until after the start of the hearing.                     In any event,\n\nJCI, represented by different counsel than its appellate counsel,\n\ndid not object during the arbitral hearing to the Committee's\n\ncomposition. There is also no evidence or claim that JCI inquired,\n\neither prior to or during the hearing, as to the employers of the\n\nCommittee members.\n\n              Both    parties   presented         evidence    and    arguments     and\n\nresponded to questions from the Committee.                   JCI's basic position\n\nwas    that   it     had   obligations       to   both    Locals,    and   that    the\n\nJurisdictional Agreement covered the dispute.                      Local 103 argued\n\nthat the Jurisdictional Agreement had never been executed and was\n\nnot    binding.        Local    103    submitted         evidence    including     its\n\ncorrespondence with JCI, the Letter of Assent, a list of JCI\n\nemployees, and payroll records and correspondence of select JCI\n\nemployees.      Local 103 argued that JCI had hired non-members as\n\ntechnicians,       apprentices,       and    other   types    of    workers   to    do\n\nelectrical work covered by the Telecommunications Labor Agreement.\n\nIn response, JCI submitted only the Jurisdictional Agreement and\n\nLetter of Assent.          It contended that it had hired only members of\n\nLocals 103 and 2222, and that its hiring practices were consistent\n\nwith   the    Jurisdictional      Agreement.         Local    103    addressed     the\n\n\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\fviability of the Jurisdictional Agreement in response to the\n\narguments and evidence presented by JCI.\n\n           The   Committee   found:   \"[JCI]   violated   the   Collective\n\nBargaining Agreement by assigning bargaining unit work to non-\n\nbargaining unit members and by contracting out bargaining unit\n\nwork.\"   The Committee found that the Jurisdictional Agreement did\n\nnot govern (1) because it was not signed by the affected Locals;\n\n(2) because the president of the International did not sign the\n\nJurisdictional    Agreement,   as   required   under   the   International\n\nConstitution to give legal effect to this sort of agreement; and\n\n(3) because JCI presented no evidence that it had a current,\n\nexecuted CBA with Local 2222 that would justify assignment of work\n\nto Local 2222 under the Jurisdictional Agreement. Any one of these\n\nthree reasons, the Committee held, would be sufficient to rebut\n\nJCI's argument that the Jurisdictional Agreement resolved the\n\ndispute.   The Committee ordered JCI to pay damages to Local 103 \"in\n\nan amount equal to make whole the Union and its members\" for all\n\npast and continuing violations. The Committee also required JCI to\n\nmake available payroll and other records to Local 103.\n\n           JCI petitioned to vacate the arbitration award pursuant\n\nto 29 U.S.C. § 185 (2000).      Local 103 answered the petition and\n\nfiled a cross-claim to affirm the award, then moved for summary\n\njudgment. Local 103 argued that JCI's claims -- that the Committee\n\nwas biased, that the Committee exceeded its jurisdiction, and that\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fthe signing of the Letter of Assent was procured by fraud -- were\n\nwaived because JCI failed to raise them during the challenged\n\nproceeding.   In support of this motion, Local 103 submitted an\n\naffidavit from its business manager, Richard Gambino, and exhibits\n\nincluding the Letter of Assent, Telecommunications Labor Agreement,\n\nJurisdictional Agreement, Committee decision, and correspondence\n\nbetween Local 103, JCI, and the Committee secretary.         JCI opposed\n\nthe motion for summary judgment and moved under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(f) for limited discovery before the court ruled on Local 103's\n\nmotion.4   In support of its opposition, JCI submitted affidavits\n\nfrom Feldman and Andrew Pickett, an attorney for JCI.              It also\n\nsubmitted exhibits including two CBAs between JCI and Local 2222\n\n(one expired, one concluded after the arbitration); an excerpt from\n\nthe Constitution of the International; and correspondence between\n\nthe Locals and JCI.\n\n           The district court granted Local 103's motion for summary\n\njudgment on August 29, 2002.     JCI Communications, Inc. v. Int'l\n\nBhd. of Elec. Workers Union, Local 103, 2002 WL 2005852, slip op.\n\nat 2 (D. Mass. Aug. 29, 2002).       The court held that JCI \"invited\"\n\nthe Committee to rule on the Jurisdictional Agreement by relying on\n\nthe Agreement as its \"primary defense.\"          Id. at 2.       The court\n\nrejected   JCI's   bias   argument    on   the   ground   that    employer\n\n\n     4\n       As part of its Rule 56(f) request, JCI sought to depose\nCarroll, former Local 103 business manager Paul Ward, and other\nmembers of Locals 103 and 2222.\n\n                                 -10-\n\frepresentatives on the Committee were \"necessarily selected\" from\n\nJCI's competitors.       Id. at 3.    In addition, the court held that JCI\n\nhad waived its argument that it signed the Letter of Assent based\n\non fraudulent representations by Local 103.                Id.   The court also\n\ndismissed evidence of a recent CBA between JCI and Local 2222\n\nbecause the agreement postdated the arbitral decision.                Id. at 2.\n\n                                          II.\n\n           This court's review of entry of summary judgment is de\n\nnovo.   Second Generation Props., L.P. v. Town of Pelham, 313 F.3d\n\n620, 629 (1st Cir. 2003).       That standard applies to our review of\n\na   district   court's    ruling     on    an   arbitral   award.    Wonderland\n\nGreyhound Park, Inc. v. Autotote Sys., Inc., 274 F.3d 34, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).    There is no material dispute of fact as to what was\n\nsubmitted to the arbitrators.\n\n           In turn, both this court and the district court are bound\n\nby the very narrow and very deferential standard of review of\n\narbitral decisions.       See Keebler Co. v. Truck Drivers, Local 170,\n\n247 F.3d 8, 10 (1st Cir.      2001).       In general, a court may vacate an\n\narbitral award only in rare circumstances, such as when there was\n\nmisconduct by the arbitrator, when the arbitrator exceeded the\n\nscope of her authority, or when the award was made in manifest\n\ndisregard of the law.       Bull HN Info. Sys. Inc. v. Hutson, 229 F.3d\n\n321, 330-31 (1st Cir. 2000).               Many of those circumstances are\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fcodified in the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, which\n\nprovides, inter alia, that a court may vacate an award:\n\n           (2)      Where there was evident partiality or corruption\n                    in the arbitrators, or either of them;\n                    . . . .\n           (4)      Where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or\n                    so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,\n                    final, and definite award upon the subject matter\n                    submitted was not made.\n\nId. § 10(a).     JCI's claims that the arbitrators acted without\n\njurisdiction and were biased are brought under these sections.\n\nA.   Whether the arbitrators exceeded their authority\n\n           JCI   argues    that     the     arbitrators        were   limited    to\n\ninterpreting the Telecommunications Labor Agreement, under which\n\nLocal 103 brought its grievance.          From this, JCI reasons that the\n\narbitrators exceeded their authority by: (1) deciding an issue\n\ngoverned by another agreement (the Jurisdictional Agreement), (2)\n\ninvalidating the Jurisdictional Agreement, (3) deciding an issue\n\ninvolving a non-party to the arbitration (Local 2222), and (4)\n\nreviewing JCI's CBA with and recognition of Local 2222.\n\n           For almost forty years it has been clear that arbitrators\n\ncan resolve jurisdictional disputes involving an employer and two\n\nlocal unions, whether the dispute is \"(1) a controversy as to\n\nwhether   certain   work   should    be     performed     by    workers   in    one\n\nbargaining unit or those in another; or (2) a controversy as to\n\nwhich union should represent the employees doing particular work.\"\n\nCarey v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 375 U.S. 261, 263 (1964). Carey\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fheld   that    the     employer    must   arbitrate    a     work    assignment\n\njurisdictional dispute on the demand of only one union.                 Id. at\n\n265-66.   Sometimes the second union seeks to intervene in the\n\narbitration, sometimes not, and this case involves no issue of\n\narbitral authority to compel the second union's participation. See\n\nElkouri & Elkouri: How Arbitration Works 350-51 (M.M. Volz & E.P.\n\nGoggin eds., 5th ed. 1997).            Thus, there was nothing wrong in\n\nprinciple with the arbitrators reviewing the agreement with one\n\nlocal although a different local had some interests at stake.                Of\n\nnecessity,     Carey    means     arbitrators   may   have    to    review   the\n\nintersections of different labor agreements in the course of\n\napplying one of them.\n\n             JCI's argument that a problem arises because Local 2222,\n\na non-party, is bound by the agreement is simply wrong.                      The\n\narbitral order does not purport to be binding on Local 2222 and no\n\nrelief is ordered as to that Local.             It is true that, until and\n\nunless JCI withdraws from the Telecommunications Labor Agreement,\n\nJCI will have to pay Local 103 for the privilege of using Local\n\n2222 members to do work the Committee found to be within the scope\n\nof the Telecommunications Labor Agreement. That may deter JCI from\n\nusing Local 2222 workers, and Local 2222 may feel its contract is\n\nviolated and grieve as a result.             But that is a problem of the\n\ncompany's own making.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f            The   argument     that    the   arbitrators      exceeded   their\n\nauthority by considering the Jurisdictional Agreement is also\n\nunavailing. JCI did not assert at the arbitration hearing that the\n\nJurisdictional Agreement deprived the arbitrators of jurisdiction;\n\nnor did it reserve the issue of the meaning of the Jurisdictional\n\nAgreement   during   the     arbitration     hearing;   nor   did   it   refuse\n\narbitration for any reason, much less on the ground that the\n\narbitrators had no authority over the Jurisdictional Agreement.\n\nOnce the submission to the arbitrators was made without such a\n\nreservation, it was for the arbitrators to determine the scope of\n\ntheir own authority.       See Dorado Beach Hotel Corp. v. Unión de\n\nTrabajadores de la Industria Gastronómica de P.R. Local 610, 959\n\nF.2d 2, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[W]e normally will defer to an\n\narbitrator's interpretation of the arbitral authority conferred by\n\nthe CBA and the parties' submissions.\").\n\n            Also, it was JCI which asked the arbitrators to consider\n\nthe Jurisdictional Agreement when JCI relied on that Agreement in\n\nits defense to the grievance.         JCI argued that the construction of\n\nthe Telecommunications Labor Agreement must be undertaken in light\n\nof the Jurisdictional Agreement, and having raised the issue\n\nitself, JCI cannot complain that the arbitrators reached it.              See,\n\ne.g., Rock-Tenn Co. v. United Paperworkers Int'l Union, 184 F.3d\n\n330, 334 (4th Cir. 1999) (\"[U]nconditional submission of an issue\n\nto arbitration, without any objection to the arbitrator's authority\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fto   decide    that   issue,   cedes   authority       to   the   arbitrator,   or\n\nrepresents     consent   to    arbitration     of   that    issue.\")   (internal\n\nquotations omitted); Franklin Elec.

Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1983) (\"[A]ny doubts\n\nconcerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in\n\nfavor of arbitration.\").\n\n              Nor is there any merit to the assertion that the manner\n\nin which the arbitrators construed the effect of the Jurisdictional\n\nAgreement exceeded their authority.           An arbitrator's award must be\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\faffirmed so long as the arbitrator is \"even arguably construing or\n\napplying the contract.\"    United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco,\n\nInc., 484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987).    Based upon the evidence before the\n\narbitrators,    the   Jurisdictional    Agreement   needed   specific\n\nsignatures to be executed and those signatures were not on the\n\ndocument:    neither of the two Locals executed it and there was no\n\nevidence that the International President approved the agreement,\n\nas the terms of the International's Constitution required.5     There\n\nwas no error in the arbitrator's finding that JCI did not proceed\n\non the basis of an executed and binding Jurisdictional Agreement.6\n\n            Since a court reviews the merits of the arbitral decision\n\nbased on the record before the arbitrator under a narrow standard\n\nof review, JCI is not free now, under the guise of judicial review\n\nof an arbitral award, to conduct discovery and obtain a de novo\n\ndetermination of the meaning and validity of the Jurisdictional\n\n\n     5\n       JCI argues that when the Vice President of the International\nsigned the Jurisdictional Agreement he represented that he had the\nauthority to bind both Local 103 and Local 2222. JCI also argues\nthat a precondition to its entering into the Telecommunications\nLabor Agreement with Local 103 was the execution of the\nJurisdictional Agreement.\n     6\n       JCI's claim that the Committee overstepped its authority by\nreviewing its CBA with Local 2222 also fails. The Committee did\nnot interpret such a CBA.         It merely observed that the\nJurisdictional Agreement (which JCI submitted) required a current\nCBA between JCI and Local 2222 to be effective, and noted that JCI\nhad presented no evidence of such an agreement. Furthermore, the\nCommittee's finding that JCI lacked a current CBA with Local 2222\nwas one of three alternative bases, each independently sufficient,\nfor the Committee's holding that the Jurisdictional Agreement did\nnot protect JCI against liability.\n\n                                 -16-\n\fAgreement.7        It long ago waived any such claim through its actions.\n\nThe district court was quite correct not to permit this effort by\n\nJCI to evade the normal rules of review.8\n\nB.   Whether the arbitrators demonstrated evident partiality\n\n                 Under the FAA, an arbitral award may be vacated on\n\ngrounds of \"evident partiality\" of the arbitrators.                 9 U.S.C. §\n\n10(a)(2).        Evident partiality is more than just the appearance of\n\npossible bias.         Rather, evident partiality means a situation in\n\nwhich       \"a   reasonable    person   would   have   to   conclude     that   an\n\narbitrator was partial to one party to an arbitration.\" Nationwide\n\nMut.

The burden is on JCI to establish evident\n\npartiality.    See Andersons, Inc. v. Horton Farms, Inc., 166 F.3d\n\n308, 328-29 (6th Cir. 1998); Al Harbi, 85 F.3d at 683; Consolidated\n\nCoal Co. v.

The purported bias here is that the three\n\narbitrators from the management side came from JCI's business\n\ncompetitors.\n\n            Absent   exceptional     circumstances,     a   court    \"will   not\n\nentertain a claim of personal bias where it could have been raised\n\nat the arbitration proceedings but was not.\"            Fort Hill Builders,\n\nInc. v.

It is undisputed that the issue of bias was not raised\n\nbefore the arbitrators.       JCI attempts to excuse this by saying it\n\ndid not know the company affiliations of these industry arbitrators\n\nuntil after the hearing.\n\n            JCI did know that the three employer representatives on\n\nthe Committee would come from Boston Chapter companies, that is,\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\ffrom its industry and related industries, and so potentially from\n\nits competitors.       The Telecommunications Labor Agreement quite\n\nreasonably    called   specifically   for   arbitrators   from   relevant\n\nindustries, whose expertise would be a considerable benefit.          See\n\nMerit Ins. Co. v. Leatherby Ins. Co., 714 F.2d 673, 679 (7th Cir.\n\n1983); In re Andros Compania Maritima, SA, 579 F.2d 691, 701 (2d\n\nCir. 1978).   That the arbitrators came from the same industry does\n\nnot in itself approach evident partiality.      See Delta Mine Holding\n\nCo. v. AFC Coal Props., Inc., 280 F.3d 815, 821 (8th Cir. 2001)\n\n(partisan arbitrators are generally permissible if that is what the\n\nparties' arbitration clause contemplated); accord ATSA of Cal.,\n\nInc. v.

This claim is a far cry from\n\nCommonwealth Coatings Corp. v. Continental Casualty Co., 393 U.S.\n\n145 (1968), where at the time of the arbitration hearing the party\n\nthat subsequently challenged the award lacked even an \"intimation\"\n\nof the source of the alleged bias.

(\"cases in which courts\n\nhave faulted arbitrators for their failure to disclose potential\n\nsources of bias are inapposite\" where the CBA contemplated that\n\nmanagement representatives on an arbitral panel might be a party's\n\ncompetitors) (citation omitted).        The mere fact that the panel\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fincluded business rivals of one party does not rise to the level of\n\nevident partiality.     Id.\n\n          In   practice,      that    risk   of   bias   could     nonetheless\n\nmaterialize in specific instances.           But JCI, which was put on\n\nnotice of the risk when it signed the contract, chose not to\n\ninquire about the backgrounds of the Committee members either\n\nbefore or during the hearing.            JCI needed to act before the\n\nCommittee rendered its decision.         It would undermine the arbitral\n\nprocess to permit an employer with an industry-represented panel to\n\nawait the outcome of an arbitration before deciding to cry bias.\n\nSee Early, 699 F.2d at 558 (\"[W]e cannot accept that parties have\n\na right to keep two strings to their bow -- to seek victory before\n\nthe tribunal and then, having lost, seek to overturn it for bias\n\nnever before claimed.\").       JCI has waived the claim.9\n\n          We   affirm   entry    of    summary    judgment   for    Local   103\n\nenforcing the arbitral award.         Costs are awarded to Local 103.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n        Having failed to raise the issue of bias with the\narbitrators, JCI was not entitled to any discovery on this point\nfrom the court.

It signed collective bargaining agreements at various times with Local 2222 and Local 103, two separate locals of the same international union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (\"International\"). JCI found itself in the cross-fire as to which work assignments belonged to which local. After JCI assigned certain work to Local 2222, Local 103 referred a grievance to arbitration in January 2002. Local 103 prevailed at arbitration. JCI filed suit to vacate the arbitral award; Local 103 cross-claimed for confirmation and sought summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment to Local 103 and JCI appealed. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JCI raises several arguments. Its two main attacks on the judgment are (1) a set of arguments going to the role played by a Jurisdictional Agreement (purportedly between Locals 103 and 2222, the International, and JCI) and (2) a claim that the arbitrators were biased. As to the first attack, JCI argues that, despite the arbitral award, it was entitled to a trial, following discovery, on the issue of whether the Jurisdictional Agreement governs the relationship between the parties. It also argues that the arbitrators exceeded the scope of their authority when they considered the validity and effect of the Jurisdictional Agreement, and so the district court erred in not vacating the award under 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(4) (2000). Second, JCI argues that the industry arbitrators were biased because they worked for JCI's competitors and so the award should have been vacated under 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(2). A common theme runs through all the arguments: that JCI wishes to present new evidence or argument to the court to undermine the arbitral award. There are very narrow circumstances in which such a maneuver is permissible; those circumstances are absent here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arguments relating to the Jurisdictional Agreement fail for a number of reasons. The district court could not independently review the role of the Jurisdictional Agreement because JCI submitted that issue to the arbitral panel and did not reserve the issue or contest the panel's authority. JCI may not, then, attempt to get discovery or retry the issue to the court. The district court properly confined itself to a review of the panel's award and to the record before the arbitrator; it succinctly and correctly found no basis for the claim that the arbitrators exceeded their authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the bias claim, while a court may, in other circumstances, take independent evidence on bias, the district court was correct to reject this claim. Here, JCI was on notice that the panel would be drawn from members of its own and related industries and, as a result, that some of JCI's competitors could be the employer representatives on the panel. Yet JCI neither inquired about the backgrounds of the arbitrators nor raised the question of possible bias before the arbitral panel. Mere participation by arbitrators from the same industry as a party does not present a facial claim of \"evident partiality\" under &#167; 10(a)(2). JCI has not preserved any claim of bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JCI has hired members of both Local 103 and Local 2222 since at least 1993, when members of both Locals did electrical work at the same project site. JCI entered into a succession of collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) with the Locals between 1993 and 2002, and signed the Jurisdictional Agreement in 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JCI entered into its first CBA with Local 2222 in 1993.

In March 1998, the business manager of Local 103 wrote to the President of JCI promising to \"continue to work with Local 2222 in order to formalize a jurisdictional agreement.\" On October 1, 1998, JCI and Local 103 executed a Letter of Assent in which JCI recognized the Boston Chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association (\"Boston Chapter\") as JCI's collective bargaining representative \"for all matters contained in or pertaining to [the] current <i>and any subsequent</i> approved Telecommunications [L]abor [A]greement between the Boston Chapter, N.E.C.A. and Local Union 103, IBEW.\" (emphasis added). The Letter was to \"remain in effect until terminated by the undersigned employer [JCI]\" with adequate written notice to the Boston Chapter and Local 103.

Both agreements recognize Local 103 as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of all employees performing a broad range of electrical work. Both agreements also provide that disputes shall be resolved via binding arbitration before a Joint Conference Committee (\"Committee\") consisting of three union representatives and three employer representatives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> These agreements, like the Letter of Assent, were duly signed by appropriate representatives of the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the heart of this case is a purported \"Jurisdictional Agreement,\" dated October 2, 1998. The document, which recognizes the existence of \"jurisdictional issues\" between the Locals \"regarding telecommunications projects,\" was characterized as an agreement between Local 103, Local 2222, and JCI. There are signature lines on the agreement for representatives of Local 103, Local 2222, JCI, and the International. Representatives of Local 103 and Local 2222 never signed the agreement. There are only two signatures: those of Frank Carroll, the International Vice President in charge of the New England region, and a JCI executive. The International Constitution provides that only the International President, or her duly appointed representative, can enter into a binding agreement with a company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After it signed the Letter of Assent and the Jurisdictional Agreement, JCI assigned work to both Locals.

Robert Feldman, Executive Vice President of JCI, claims that JCI did not learn that the Boston Chapter arbitrators were employed by competitors until after the start of the hearing. In any event, JCI, represented by different counsel than its appellate counsel, did not object during the arbitral hearing to the Committee's composition. There is also no evidence or claim that JCI inquired, either prior to or during the hearing, as to the employers of the Committee members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties presented evidence and arguments and responded to questions from the Committee. JCI's basic position was that it had obligations to both Locals, and that the Jurisdictional Agreement covered the dispute. Local 103 argued that the Jurisdictional Agreement had never been executed and was not binding. Local 103 submitted evidence including its correspondence with JCI, the Letter of Assent, a list of JCI employees, and payroll records and correspondence of select JCI employees. Local 103 argued that JCI had hired non-members as technicians, apprentices, and other types of workers to do electrical work covered by the Telecommunications Labor Agreement. In response, JCI submitted only the Jurisdictional Agreement and Letter of Assent. It contended that it had hired only members of Locals 103 and 2222, and that its hiring practices were consistent with the Jurisdictional Agreement. Local 103 addressed the viability of the Jurisdictional Agreement in response to the arguments and evidence presented by JCI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Committee found: \"[JCI] violated the Collective Bargaining Agreement by assigning bargaining unit work to non-bargaining unit members and by contracting out bargaining unit work.\" The Committee found that the Jurisdictional Agreement did not govern (1) because it was not signed by the affected Locals; (2) because the president of the International did not sign the Jurisdictional Agreement, as required under the International Constitution to give legal effect to this sort of agreement; and (3) because JCI presented no evidence that it had a current, executed CBA with Local 2222 that would justify assignment of work to Local 2222 under the Jurisdictional Agreement. Any one of these three reasons, the Committee held, would be sufficient to rebut JCI's argument that the Jurisdictional Agreement resolved the dispute. The Committee ordered JCI to pay damages to Local 103 \"in an amount equal to make whole the Union and its members\" for all past and continuing violations. The Committee also required JCI to make available payroll and other records to Local 103.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JCI petitioned to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185 (2000). Local 103 answered the petition and filed a cross-claim to affirm the award, then moved for summary judgment. Local 103 argued that JCI's claims &#8212; that the Committee was biased, that the Committee exceeded its jurisdiction, and that the signing of the Letter of Assent was procured by fraud &#8212; were waived because JCI failed to raise them during the challenged proceeding. In support of this motion, Local 103 submitted an affidavit from its business manager, Richard Gambino, and exhibits including the Letter of Assent, Telecommunications Labor Agreement, Jurisdictional Agreement, Committee decision, and correspondence between Local 103, JCI, and the Committee secretary. JCI opposed the motion for summary judgment and moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) for limited discovery before the court ruled on Local 103's motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In support of its opposition, JCI submitted affidavits from Feldman and Andrew Pickett, an attorney for JCI. It also submitted exhibits including two CBAs between JCI and Local 2222 (one expired, one concluded after the arbitration); an excerpt from the Constitution of the International; and correspondence between the Locals and JCI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted Local 103's motion for summary judgment on August 29, 2002. <i>JCI Communications, Inc. v. Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers Union, Local 103,</i> 2002 WL 2005852, slip op. at 2 (D.Mass. Aug. 29, 2002). The court held that JCI \"invited\" the Committee to rule on the Jurisdictional Agreement by relying on the Agreement as its \"primary defense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2. The court rejected JCI's bias argument on the ground that employer representatives on the Committee were \"necessarily selected\" from JCI's competitors. <i>Id.</i> at 3. In addition, the court held that JCI had waived its argument that it signed the Letter of Assent based on fraudulent representations by Local 103. <i>Id.</i> The court also dismissed evidence of a recent CBA between JCI and Local 2222 because the agreement postdated the arbitral decision. <i>Id.</i> at 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court's review of entry of summary judgment is de novo. <i>Second Generation Props., L.P. v. Town of Pelham,</i> 313 F.3d 620, 629 (1st Cir.2002). That standard applies to our review of a district court's ruling on an arbitral award. <i>Wonderland Greyhound Park, Inc. v. Autotote Sys., Inc.,</i> 274 F.3d 34, 35 (1st Cir.2001). There is no material dispute of fact as to what was submitted to the arbitrators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In turn, both this court and the district court are bound by the very narrow and very deferential standard of review of arbitral decisions. <i>See Keebler Co. v. Truck Drivers, Local 170,</i> 247 F.3d 8, 10 (1st Cir.2001). In general, a court may vacate an arbitral award only in rare circumstances, such as when there was misconduct by the arbitrator, when the arbitrator exceeded the scope of her authority, or when the award was made in manifest disregard of the law. <i>Bull HN Info. Sys. Inc. v. Hutson,</i> 229 F.3d 321, 330-31 (1st Cir.2000). Many of those circumstances are codified in the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1-16, which provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that a court may vacate an award:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 10(a). JCI's claims that the arbitrators acted without jurisdiction and were biased are brought under these sections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Whether the arbitrators exceeded their authority</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JCI argues that the arbitrators were limited to interpreting the Telecommunications Labor Agreement, under which Local 103 brought its grievance. From this, JCI reasons that the arbitrators exceeded their authority by: (1) deciding an issue governed by another agreement (the Jurisdictional Agreement), (2) invalidating the Jurisdictional Agreement, (3) deciding an issue involving a non-party to the arbitration (Local 2222), and (4) reviewing JCI's CBA with and recognition of Local 2222.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For almost forty years it has been clear that arbitrators can resolve jurisdictional disputes involving an employer and two local unions, whether the dispute is \"(1) a controversy as to whether certain work should be performed by workers in one bargaining unit or those in another; or (2) a controversy as to which union should represent the employees doing particular work.\" <i>Carey v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp.,</i> 375 U.S. 261, 263, 84 S.Ct. 401, 11 L.Ed.2d 320 (1964). <i>Carey</i> held that the employer must arbitrate a work assignment jurisdictional dispute on the demand of only one union. <i>Id.</i> at 265-66, 84 S.Ct. 401. Sometimes the second union seeks to intervene in the arbitration, sometimes not, and this case involves no issue of arbitral authority to compel the second union's participation. <i>See Elkouri &amp; Elkouri: How Arbitration Works</i> 350-51 (M.M. Volz &amp; E.P. Goggin eds., 5th ed.1997). Thus, there was nothing wrong in principle with the arbitrators reviewing the agreement with one local although a different local had some interests at stake. Of necessity, <i>Carey</i> means arbitrators may have to review the intersections of different labor agreements in the course of applying one of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JCI's argument that a problem arises because Local 2222, a non-party, is bound by the agreement is simply wrong. The arbitral order does not purport to be binding on Local 2222 and no relief is ordered as to that Local. It is true that, until and unless JCI withdraws from the Telecommunications Labor Agreement, JCI will have to pay Local 103 for the privilege of using Local 2222 members to do work the Committee found to be within the scope of the Telecommunications Labor Agreement. That may deter JCI from using Local 2222 workers, and Local 2222 may feel its contract is violated and grieve as a result. But that is a problem of the company's own making.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument that the arbitrators exceeded their authority by considering the Jurisdictional Agreement is also unavailing. JCI did not assert at the arbitration hearing that the Jurisdictional Agreement deprived the arbitrators of jurisdiction; nor did it reserve the issue of the meaning of the Jurisdictional Agreement during the arbitration hearing; nor did it refuse arbitration for any reason, much less on the ground that the arbitrators had no authority over the Jurisdictional Agreement. Once the submission to the arbitrators was made without such a reservation, it was for the arbitrators to determine the scope of their own authority. <i>See Dorado Beach Hotel Corp. v. Uni&#243;n de Trabajadores de la Industria Gastron&#243;mica de P.R. Local 610,</i> 959 F.2d 2, 4-5 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[W]e normally will defer to an arbitrator's interpretation of the arbitral authority conferred by the CBA and the parties' submissions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, it was JCI which asked the arbitrators to consider the Jurisdictional Agreement when JCI relied on that Agreement in its defense to the grievance. JCI argued that the construction of the Telecommunications Labor Agreement must be undertaken in light of the Jurisdictional Agreement, and having raised the issue itself, JCI cannot complain that the arbitrators reached it. <i>See, e.g., Rock-Tenn Co. v. United Paperworkers Int'l Union,</i> 184 F.3d 330, 334 (4th Cir.1999) (\"[U]nconditional submission of an issue to arbitration, without any objection to the arbitrator's authority to decide that issue, cedes authority to the arbitrator, or represents consent to arbitration of that issue.\") (internal quotations omitted); <i>Franklin Elec.

An arbitrator's award must be affirmed so long as the arbitrator is \"even arguably construing or applying the contract.\" <i>United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc.,</i> 484 U.S. 29, 38, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987). Based upon the evidence before the arbitrators, the Jurisdictional Agreement needed specific signatures to be executed and those signatures were not on the document: neither of the two Locals executed it and there was no evidence that the International President approved the agreement, as the terms of the International's Constitution required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> There was no error in the arbitrator's finding that JCI did not proceed on the basis of an executed and binding Jurisdictional Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since a court reviews the merits of the arbitral decision based on the record before the arbitrator under a narrow standard of review, JCI is not free now, under the guise of judicial review of an arbitral award, to conduct discovery and obtain a de novo determination of the meaning and validity of the Jurisdictional Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> It long ago waived any such claim through its actions.

The Telecommunications Labor Agreement quite reasonably called specifically for arbitrators from relevant industries, whose expertise would be a considerable benefit. <i>See Merit Ins. Co. v. Leatherby Ins. Co.,</i> 714 F.2d 673, 679 (7th Cir.1983); <i>In re Andros Compania Maritima, SA,</i> 579 F.2d 691, 701 (2d Cir.1978). That the arbitrators came from the same industry does not in itself approach evident partiality. <i>See Delta Mine Holding Co. v. AFC Coal Props., Inc.,</i> 280 F.3d 815, 821 (8th Cir.2001) (partisan arbitrators are generally permissible if that is what the parties' arbitration clause contemplated); <i>accord ATSA of Cal., Inc. v.

This claim is a far cry from <i>Commonwealth Coatings Corp. v. Continental Casualty Co.,</i> 393 U.S. 145, 89 S.Ct. 337, 21 L.Ed.2d 301 (1968), where at the time of the arbitration hearing the party that subsequently challenged the award lacked even an \"intimation\" of the source of the alleged bias. <i>Id.</i> at 147-48, 89 S.Ct. 337; <i>see Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Ass'n Local 420 v. Kinney Air Conditioning Co.,</i> 756 F.2d 742, 746 (9th Cir. 1985) (Kennedy, J.) (\"cases in which courts have faulted arbitrators for their failure to disclose potential sources of bias are inapposite\" where the CBA contemplated that management representatives on an arbitral panel might be a party's competitors) (citation omitted). The mere fact that the panel included business rivals of one party does not rise to the level of evident partiality. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In practice, that risk of bias could nonetheless materialize in specific instances. But JCI, which was put on notice of the risk when it signed the contract, chose not to inquire about the backgrounds of the Committee members either before or during the hearing. JCI needed to act before the Committee rendered its decision. It would undermine the arbitral process to permit an employer with an industry-represented panel to await the outcome of an arbitration before deciding to cry bias. <i>See Early,</i> 699 F.2d at 558 (\"[W]e cannot accept that parties have a right to keep two strings to their bow &#8212; to seek victory before the tribunal and then, having lost, seek to overturn it for bias never before claimed.\").

It signed collective bargaining agreements at various times with Local 2222 and Local 103, two separate locals of the same international union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (\"International\"). JCI found itself in the cross-fire as to which work assignments belonged to which local. After JCI assigned certain work to Local 2222, Local 103 referred a grievance to arbitration in January 2002. Local 103 prevailed at arbitration. JCI filed suit to vacate the arbitral award; Local 103 cross-claimed for confirmation and sought summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment to Local 103 and JCI appealed. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JCI raises several arguments. Its two main attacks on the judgment are (1) a set of arguments going to the role played by a Jurisdictional Agreement (purportedly between Locals 103 and 2222, the International, and JCI) and (2) a claim that the arbitrators were biased. As to the first attack, JCI argues that, despite the arbitral award, it was entitled to a trial, following discovery, on the issue of whether the Jurisdictional Agreement governs the relationship between the parties. It also argues that the arbitrators exceeded the scope of their authority when they considered the validity and effect of the Jurisdictional Agreement, and so the district court erred in not vacating the award under 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(4) (2000). Second, JCI argues that the industry arbitrators were biased because they worked for JCI's competitors and so the award should have been vacated under 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(2). A common theme runs through all the arguments: that JCI wishes to present new evidence or argument to the court to undermine the arbitral award. There are very narrow circumstances in which such a maneuver is permissible; those circumstances are absent here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arguments relating to the Jurisdictional Agreement fail for a number of reasons. The district court could not independently review the role of the Jurisdictional Agreement because JCI submitted that issue to the arbitral panel and did not reserve the issue or contest the panel's authority. JCI may not, then, attempt to get discovery or retry the issue to the court. The district court properly confined itself to a review of the panel's award and to the record before the arbitrator; it succinctly and correctly found no basis for the claim that the arbitrators exceeded their authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the bias claim, while a court may, in other circumstances, take independent evidence on bias, the district court was correct to reject this claim. Here, JCI was on notice that the panel would be drawn from members of its own and related industries and, as a result, that some of JCI's competitors could be the employer representatives on the panel. Yet JCI neither inquired about the backgrounds of the arbitrators nor raised the question of possible bias before the arbitral panel. Mere participation by arbitrators from the same industry as a party does not present a facial claim of \"evident partiality\" under &#167; 10(a)(2). JCI has not preserved any claim of bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JCI has hired members of both Local 103 and Local 2222 since at least 1993, when members of both Locals did electrical work at the same project site. JCI entered into a succession of collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) with the Locals between 1993 and 2002, and signed the Jurisdictional Agreement in 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JCI entered into its first CBA with Local 2222 in 1993. That agreement expired and JCI entered into another CBA with Local 2222 that was in force from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 1999.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> JCI and Local 2222 did not sign another CBA until May 15, 2002, more than three months after the unfavorable arbitral award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JCI assented in 1998 to a CBA concluded in 1997 between an employers association and Local 103. In March 1998, the business manager of Local 103 wrote to the President of JCI promising to \"continue to work with Local 2222 in order to formalize a jurisdictional agreement.\" On October 1, 1998, JCI and Local 103 executed a Letter of Assent in which JCI recognized the Boston Chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association (\"Boston Chapter\") as JCI's collective bargaining representative \"for all matters contained in or pertaining to [the] current <i>and any subsequent</i> approved Telecommunications [L]abor [A]greement between the Boston Chapter, N.E.C.A. and Local Union 103, IBEW.\" (emphasis added). The Letter was to \"remain in effect until terminated by the undersigned employer [JCI]\" with adequate written notice to the Boston Chapter and Local 103. JCI never provided written notice of termination to Local 103.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The then-current Telecommunications Labor Agreement, signed on September 1, 1997, expired on February 29, 2000 and was replaced by a succeeding Telecommunications Labor Agreement, dated March 1, 2000. Both agreements recognize Local 103 as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of all employees performing a broad range of electrical work. Both agreements also provide that disputes shall be resolved via binding arbitration before a Joint Conference Committee (\"Committee\") consisting of three union representatives and three employer representatives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> These agreements, like the Letter of Assent, were duly signed by appropriate representatives of the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the heart of this case is a purported \"Jurisdictional Agreement,\" dated October 2, 1998. The document, which recognizes the existence of \"jurisdictional issues\" between the Locals \"regarding telecommunications projects,\" was characterized as an agreement between Local 103, Local 2222, and JCI. There are signature lines on the agreement for representatives of Local 103, Local 2222, JCI, and the International. Representatives of Local 103 and Local 2222 never signed the agreement. There are only two signatures: those of Frank Carroll, the International Vice President in charge of the New England region, and a JCI executive. The International Constitution provides that only the International President, or her duly appointed representative, can enter into a binding agreement with a company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After it signed the Letter of Assent and the Jurisdictional Agreement, JCI assigned work to both Locals. JCI continued assigning work to Local 2222 after its CBA with Local 2222 expired at the end of 1999. JCI says Local 2222 agreed to extend this CBA while the parties negotiated a new one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Boston Chapter contractor filed charges against JCI alleging that it had violated the Telecommunications Labor Agreement by giving work reserved for Local 103 members to members of Local 2222. On January 21, 2002, Local 103 referred a grievance to the Committee, under the procedure set forth in the Telecommunications Labor Agreement, asserting that JCI was assigning work covered by that agreement to members of Local 2222.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Committee met on February 4, 2002. Per the terms of the Telecommunications Labor Agreement, the Committee consisted of three representatives of Local 103 and three representatives of the Boston Chapter. As JCI alleged to the court, but not to the Committee, the Boston Chapter representatives worked for competitors of JCI that had in the past lost job bids to JCI. Robert Feldman, Executive Vice President of JCI, claims that JCI did not learn that the Boston Chapter arbitrators were employed by competitors until after the start of the hearing. In any event, JCI, represented by different counsel than its appellate counsel, did not object during the arbitral hearing to the Committee's composition. There is also no evidence or claim that JCI inquired, either prior to or during the hearing, as to the employers of the Committee members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties presented evidence and arguments and responded to questions from the Committee. JCI's basic position was that it had obligations to both Locals, and that the Jurisdictional Agreement covered the dispute. Local 103 argued that the Jurisdictional Agreement had never been executed and was not binding. Local 103 submitted evidence including its correspondence with JCI, the Letter of Assent, a list of JCI employees, and payroll records and correspondence of select JCI employees. Local 103 argued that JCI had hired non-members as technicians, apprentices, and other types of workers to do electrical work covered by the Telecommunications Labor Agreement. In response, JCI submitted only the Jurisdictional Agreement and Letter of Assent. It contended that it had hired only members of Locals 103 and 2222, and that its hiring practices were consistent with the Jurisdictional Agreement. Local 103 addressed the viability of the Jurisdictional Agreement in response to the arguments and evidence presented by JCI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Committee found: \"[JCI] violated the Collective Bargaining Agreement by assigning bargaining unit work to non-bargaining unit members and by contracting out bargaining unit work.\" The Committee found that the Jurisdictional Agreement did not govern (1) because it was not signed by the affected Locals; (2) because the president of the International did not sign the Jurisdictional Agreement, as required under the International Constitution to give legal effect to this sort of agreement; and (3) because JCI presented no evidence that it had a current, executed CBA with Local 2222 that would justify assignment of work to Local 2222 under the Jurisdictional Agreement. Any one of these three reasons, the Committee held, would be sufficient to rebut JCI's argument that the Jurisdictional Agreement resolved the dispute. The Committee ordered JCI to pay damages to Local 103 \"in an amount equal to make whole the Union and its members\" for all past and continuing violations. The Committee also required JCI to make available payroll and other records to Local 103.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JCI petitioned to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185 (2000). Local 103 answered the petition and filed a cross-claim to affirm the award, then moved for summary judgment. Local 103 argued that JCI's claims &#8212; that the Committee was biased, that the Committee exceeded its jurisdiction, and that the signing of the Letter of Assent was procured by fraud &#8212; were waived because JCI failed to raise them during the challenged proceeding. In support of this motion, Local 103 submitted an affidavit from its business manager, Richard Gambino, and exhibits including the Letter of Assent, Telecommunications Labor Agreement, Jurisdictional Agreement, Committee decision, and correspondence between Local 103, JCI, and the Committee secretary. JCI opposed the motion for summary judgment and moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) for limited discovery before the court ruled on Local 103's motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In support of its opposition, JCI submitted affidavits from Feldman and Andrew Pickett, an attorney for JCI. It also submitted exhibits including two CBAs between JCI and Local 2222 (one expired, one concluded after the arbitration); an excerpt from the Constitution of the International; and correspondence between the Locals and JCI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted Local 103's motion for summary judgment on August 29, 2002. <i>JCI Communications, Inc. v.

The court rejected JCI's bias argument on the ground that employer representatives on the Committee were \"necessarily selected\" from JCI's competitors. <i>Id.</i> at 3. In addition, the court held that JCI had waived its argument that it signed the Letter of Assent based on fraudulent representations by Local 103. <i>Id.</i> The court also dismissed evidence of a recent CBA between JCI and Local 2222 because the agreement postdated the arbitral decision. <i>Id.</i> at 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court's review of entry of summary judgment is de novo. <i>Second Generation Props., L.P. v.

In general, a court may vacate an arbitral award only in rare circumstances, such as when there was misconduct by the arbitrator, when the arbitrator exceeded the scope of her authority, or when the award was made in manifest disregard of the law. <i>Bull HN Info.

Many of those circumstances are codified in the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1-16, which provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that a court may vacate an award:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 10(a).

From this, JCI reasons that the arbitrators exceeded their authority by: (1) deciding an issue governed by another agreement (the Jurisdictional Agreement), (2) invalidating the Jurisdictional Agreement, (3) deciding an issue involving a non-party to the arbitration (Local 2222), and (4) reviewing JCI's CBA with and recognition of Local 2222.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For almost forty years it has been clear that arbitrators can resolve jurisdictional disputes involving an employer and two local unions, whether the dispute is \"(1) a controversy as to whether certain work should be performed by workers in one bargaining unit or those in another; or (2) a controversy as to which union should represent the employees doing particular work.\" <i>Carey v.

Sometimes the second union seeks to intervene in the arbitration, sometimes not, and this case involves no issue of arbitral authority to compel the second union's participation. <i>See Elkouri &amp; Elkouri: How Arbitration Works</i> 350-51 (M.M. Volz &amp; E.P. Goggin eds., 5th ed.1997). Thus, there was nothing wrong in principle with the arbitrators reviewing the agreement with one local although a different local had some interests at stake. Of necessity, <i>Carey</i> means arbitrators may have to review the intersections of different labor agreements in the course of applying one of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JCI's argument that a problem arises because Local 2222, a non-party, is bound by the agreement is simply wrong. The arbitral order does not purport to be binding on Local 2222 and no relief is ordered as to that Local. It is true that, until and unless JCI withdraws from the Telecommunications Labor Agreement, JCI will have to pay Local 103 for the privilege of using Local 2222 members to do work the Committee found to be within the scope of the Telecommunications Labor Agreement. That may deter JCI from using Local 2222 workers, and Local 2222 may feel its contract is violated and grieve as a result. But that is a problem of the company's own making.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument that the arbitrators exceeded their authority by considering the Jurisdictional Agreement is also unavailing. JCI did not assert at the arbitration hearing that the Jurisdictional Agreement deprived the arbitrators of jurisdiction; nor did it reserve the issue of the meaning of the Jurisdictional Agreement during the arbitration hearing; nor did it refuse arbitration for any reason, much less on the ground that the arbitrators had no authority over the Jurisdictional Agreement. Once the submission to the arbitrators was made without such a reservation, it was for the arbitrators to determine the scope of their own authority. <i>See Dorado Beach Hotel Corp. v.
