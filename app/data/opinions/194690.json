Panel  rehearing is hereby denied for  the following\n                                              \nreasons.\n\n     First,  a party may not raise new and additional matters for\nthe first time in a petition for rehearing.  See Kale v. Combined\n                                                                 \nIns.

That rule  has particular\npertinence  here because,  following  oral  argument,  the  panel\ninvited supplemental briefing on the specific question of federal\ncourt  removal jurisdiction  in  light  of International  Primate\n                                                                 \nProtection League v.

Appellee's  response  at  the  time  was  a\nperfunctory one; none  of the arguments  raised in her  rehearing\npetition  were alluded  to  in her  supplemental  brief, even  in\npassing.  We will  not revisit specific issues merely  because an\nadverse result has infused new vigor  into a discontented party's\nadvocacy.\n\n     Second,  even  if  we  were  to  consider  them,  appellee's\nsubstantive  arguments in no way undermine the force of the panel\nopinion.   Only one such argument merits additional comment.  The\n\ncynosure of  Belaga's petition  is her newly  emergent contention\nthat  the  panel's  treatment  of Primate  Protection  League  is\n                                                             \ninsupportable because,  she maintains, suits against  officers in\ntheir official capacities are not equivalent to suits against the\nagency.   Relying primarily on  Kozera v. Spirito,  723 F.2d 1003\n                                                 \n(1st Cir. 1983), a  pre-Primate Protection League case discussing\n                                                 \nwhat  is  loosely termed  an  \"exception[]  to  the  doctrine  of\nsovereign  immunity .  . .  in injunctive  suits against  federal\nofficials,\"  id. at 1008  (applying Larson v.  Domestic &amp; Foreign\n                                                                 \nCommerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689-90 (1949)), Belaga disputes the\n              \nstatement that  \"no issues  of immunity  can  possibly arise  [in\nofficial-capacity suits] that differ from those arising in a suit\ndirectly against  the agency.\"   Ante  at     [Panel  Op. at  9].\n                                     \nBelaga's reliance on Larson  and its progeny, such as  Kozera, is\n                                                             \nmisplaced.\n\n     Whatever consequences the Larson  exception may portend in a\n                                     \nproper case, it  has no  applicability here.   Larson comes  into\n                                                     \nplay  when either (1) a federal officer  acts in excess of his or\nher statutory authority, or (2) the statute conferring power upon\nthe officer  is unconstitutional, see  Kozera, 723 F.2d  at 1008;\n                                             \nsee also Larson, 337 U.S. at 689-90.  The basis for the exception\n               \nis clear; where the Larson criteria are met, \"the conduct against\n                          \nwhich  specific relief is  sought is beyond  the officer's powers\nand  is, therefore, not the  conduct of the  sovereign.\"  Larson,\n                                                                \n337 U.S.  at 690;  where the  criteria are  not met,  however, an\nofficial-capacity \"suit  is  barred, not  because  it is  a  suit\nagainst  an  officer of  the Government,  but  because it  is, in\nsubstance, a suit against the Government over which the court, in\nthe  absence of  consent,  has no  jurisdiction.\"   Id.  at  688.\n                                                       \nClearly,  then, the  Larson  exception concerns  the doctrine  of\n                           \ngovernmental, not  official, immunity. Where relief  would not be\nobtainable  against the  agency,  as such,  because of  sovereign\nimmunity,  the exception  nevertheless  enables  a  plaintiff  to\nobtain  specific relief when an  officer is named  and the case's\n                                                      \nunderlying  merits satisfy  one of  the two  conditions described\nabove.   See  id. at 689-90.   Viewed in  this manner    as a way\n                 \naround the  sovereign immunity  of agencies     Larson erects  no\n                                                      \nshield  for protecting  individual  officers from  the impact  of\nlawsuits and, indeed, enunciates no rule bearing thereon.\n\n     This is all  distant from the jurisdictional issue  on which\nthe  instant case turns.   The functional purpose  of the officer\nremoval statute, as expressed in Primate Protection League, is to\n                                                          \nguarantee the availability of a federal forum  for the resolution\nof complicated questions of immunity, see 111 S. Ct. at 1708, not\n                                         \nto guarantee such a forum for litigation of the underlying merits\nof every suit against a government actor.  When a case, like this\none,  poses  no  special questions  of  immunity  as the  federal\nofficer/defendant was sued purely in her representative capacity,\nthe  defendant must be content  with the plaintiff's  choice of a\nstate judicial forum to resolve a state-law claim.  Belaga points\nto nothing that can affect her, personally, in any way that would\ndiffer from how  the agency would  be affected,  and, as we  have\n\nmade  clear, ante at    ,     [Panel  Op. at 4, 9], the complaint\n                 \nin this  case seeks  relief against  the  sovereign, not  against\nBelaga personally.\n\n     We add one final  observation.  To a large  extent, Belaga's\nbelated  reference  to  Larson  stirs  a  tempest  in  a  teapot.\n                              \nWhenever a complaint raises a federal question, which will almost\nalways  be the case when Larson applies, removal is allowed under\n                               \n28  U.S.C.   1331.  Our decision that official-capacity suits are\nnot  removable as  such under  28 U.S.C.    1442(a)(1)  will only\naffect those  cases in  which an  officer is sued  in his  or her\nofficial  capacity by  a  plaintiff whose  complaint raises  only\nissues of state law.  This case is prototypical of that genre.\n\n     The petition for panel rehearing is denied.\n                                               \n",

When a case, like this\none,  poses  no  special questions  of  immunity  as the  federal\nofficer/defendant was sued purely in her representative capacity,\nthe  defendant must be content  with the plaintiff's  choice of a\nstate judicial forum to resolve a state-law claim.  Belaga points\nto nothing that can affect her, personally, in any way that would\ndiffer from how  the agency would  be affected,  and, as we  have\n\nmade  clear, ante at    ,     [Panel  Op. at 4, 9], the complaint\n                 \nin this  case seeks  relief against  the  sovereign, not  against\nBelaga personally.\n\n     We add one final  observation.  To a large  extent, Belaga's\nbelated  reference  to  Larson  stirs  a  tempest  in  a  teapot.\n                              \nWhenever a complaint raises a federal question, which will almost\nalways  be the case when Larson applies, removal is allowed under\n                               \n28  U.S.C.   1331.  Our decision that official-capacity suits are\nnot  removable as  such under  28 U.S.C.    1442(a)(1)  will only\naffect those  cases in  which an  officer is sued  in his  or her\nofficial  capacity by  a  plaintiff whose  complaint raises  only\nissues of state law.  This case is prototypical of that genre.\n\n     The petition for panel rehearing is denied.\n                                               \n</pre>",
