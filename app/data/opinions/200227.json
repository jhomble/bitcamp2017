Stephen J. Swift, U.S. Tax Court Judge]\n\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                      Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                  Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge, and\n                      Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Brian C.

Hagley, Attorney, Tax Division, with whom Eileen J.\nO'Connor, Assistant Attorney General, and Gilbert S. Rothenberg,\nAttorney, Tax Division, were on brief, for Appellee.\n\n\n\n                         November 27, 2002\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.      This case raises the issue of the\n\ndeductibility of legal fees paid for a defense against criminal\n\ncharges as ordinary and necessary business expenses under Internal\n\nRevenue Code § 162(a) (2000).        The petitioners, a corporation and\n\nthe sole shareholder of that corporation, were sent tax deficiency\n\nnotices by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on April 24, 2000, in\n\nthe sum of $116,950.00 for the corporation and $312,874.00 for the\n\nindividual, plus penalties under I.R.C. § 6662.               Both of the\n\ndeficiency notices stemmed from legal fees relating to the defense\n\nof a federal criminal indictment against Kenneth Guarino.               The\n\nlegal fees were paid and then deducted by the corporation, Capital\n\nVideo Corporation, and were not counted as income by Guarino, the\n\ncorporation's   sole   shareholder.        Petitioners   argue   that   the\n\ncriminal conduct was so related to the operation of the corporation\n\nthat the   legal   fees   were   a   deductible   corporate   expense   and\n\nproperly not included in Guarino's gross income.           The tax court\n\ndisagreed, finding that the criminal charges were not sufficiently\n\nrelated to the operation of the corporation.        We affirm the ruling\n\nof the tax court.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           These facts are derived from the joint stipulated facts\n\nand from the exhibits, which were stipulated to be authentic.1          The\n\n\n     1\n       Some facts are taken from Guarino's plea agreement. Because\nonly the authenticity of the plea agreement has been stipulated to,\nthe parties dispute whether the facts detailed in the plea\n\n                                     -2-\n\fparties rested on only these facts and exhibits before the tax\n\ncourt.\n\n             In 1979, Kenneth Guarino created and incorporated Capital\n\nVideo Corporation, located in Cranston, Rhode Island; Guarino was\n\nthe   sole   shareholder.     Capital    Video   was   a   distributor    of\n\npornographic    videotapes.    Guarino    was    associated   with    Natale\n\nRichichi, a capo in the Gambino family of La Cosa Nostra, who dealt\n\ndirectly with the bosses of both the Gambino and Patriarca families\n\nand had influence with other factions of La Cosa Nostra.             Guarino\n\nwas concerned that members of other organized crime families would\n\nextort money from, or take over, his multimillion dollar business.\n\nHe also worried that organized crime would interfere with his other\n\nbusiness ventures, including a show at the Dunes Hotel and Casino\n\nin Las Vegas, called \"Night Dreams,\" and a precious metals business\n\nin the New England area.\n\n             Guarino in 1979 began to pay \"tribute\" to Richichi to\n\nfend off extortion attempts and to assist Guarino with other\n\nbusiness matters where Richichi's influence as a capo might benefit\n\nGuarino.     This included protection for the Night Dreams production\n\nand the precious metals business in New England, and for influence\n\nwith various union officials.     The payments averaged between eight\n\n\n\nagreement are binding on the parties. This debate is inapposite,\nbecause the only facts we derive from the plea agreement are used\nagainst the petitioners, who urged that the plea agreement facts be\nbinding.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fand ten thousand dollars twice per month.         The total amount of the\n\npayments is in dispute, but between July 1985 and September 1995,\n\nGuarino paid Richichi at least $1,728,000 in cash.\n\n            A substantial portion of Richichi's income came from\n\nGuarino's   payments,   and    Richichi   was    not   otherwise   lawfully\n\nemployed.   Richichi worried that the IRS would become aware of and\n\nattempt to tax his substantial income and assets.            As a result,\n\nRichichi and Guarino made arrangements to conceal the tribute\n\npayments from the IRS.        The payments were always made in cash.\n\nWhile some of the funds were paid by Capital Video, these payments\n\nwere kept off of its accounting books.          Some payments were hidden\n\nby skimming funds from the profits of Capital Video's video booth\n\nand peep show machines; Capital Video generated false Forms 1099 so\n\nthat it appeared that the skimmed profits were instead flowing to\n\nGuarino and a nominee owner.2     Other funds from Capital Video were\n\nreported as loans and dividends to nominee owners; Capital Video's\n\nbookkeeper, Guarino's former mother-in-law, would write these loan\n\nand dividend checks and cash them herself.          Guarino also provided\n\nRichichi with a Capital Video credit card, had Capital Video lease\n\nMercedes-Benz automobiles for him and for his daughter, and paid\n\nfor health insurance coverage for Richichi and his wife under\n\nCapital Video's employee plan.\n\n\n\n     2\n       A \"nominee owner\" is someone who owns an asset merely on\npaper, in order to disguise the true owner of property.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f             Apart from helping to hide the tribute payments from the\n\nIRS, Guarino also helped Richichi hide other assets. For instance,\n\nGuarino   advised     Richichi        on   the     details    of    how    to    hide    his\n\nownership    of    property      in    the       Dominican    Republic      by    using    a\n\ncorporation and nominee owners.                  He also offered to help conceal\n\nRichichi's interest in property more directly, though there were no\n\nallegations that Guarino actually served in anything more than an\n\nadvisory capacity with regard to Richichi's other assets.\n\n             In October 1992, Guarino and Richichi, along with another\n\ndefendant, were indicted by a federal grand jury on one count of\n\nconspiring    to    bribe   an    official         of   the    stagehands        union    in\n\nconnection with Guarino's Las Vegas show.                    In August 1994, Guarino\n\nand Richichi were indicted with three others in a superseding\n\nindictment.       Count One alleged a conspiracy to \"defraud the United\n\nStates by impeding, impairing, obstructing, and defeating the\n\nlawful government functions of the [IRS] in the ascertainment,\n\ncomputation, assessment, and collection of federal income taxes\n\nowed   by\"   Richichi.        Count        Two    reiterated       the    allegation      of\n\nconspiracy to bribe a union official.                    Finally, in August 1995\n\nGuarino and Richichi were again indicted under a second superseding\n\nindictment for both of these counts, and they were also each\n\nseparately indicted for several counts of interstate transportation\n\n\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\fof obscene material through the use of a common carrier, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1462, and aiding and abetting that crime under 18 U.S.C. § 2.3\n\n            In January 1997, Guarino, as part of a plea agreement,\n\npled guilty only to the charge of conspiracy to evade taxes. He was\n\nsentenced to sixteen months in prison, eleven of which were served\n\nin a halfway house, and fined $250,000.\n\n            Capital Video was a subchapter C corporation whose fiscal\n\nyear began on March 1.      On March 1, 1996, Capital Video elected to\n\nbe treated instead as a subchapter S corporation.            This change in\n\nstatus meant, among other things, that its fiscal year needed to\n\nmatch the calendar year. As a result, Capital Video's first fiscal\n\nyear as a subchapter S corporation was a short one, lasting from\n\nMarch 1 to December 31, 1996.\n\n            During the calendar years 1995 and 1996, Capital Video,\n\nout of its corporate funds, paid for all of the legal defense fees\n\nfor Guarino stemming from all of these criminal indictments.\n\nCapital Video paid $250,034 in fees during calendar year 1995 and\n\n$517,038    in   fees   during   calendar   year   1996,   for   a   total   of\n\n$767,072.    Of that amount, Capital Video spent $343,971 between\n\nMarch 1, 1995 and February 29, 1996, when it was a C corporation.\n\nFor the C corporation fiscal year ending February 29, 1996, Capital\n\nVideo deducted as ordinary and necessary business expenses the\n\n\n     3\n       The obscenity charges did not stem from the operations of\nCapital Video, which was an on-site video store, but instead\ninvolved separate mail-order pornographic video businesses.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f$343,971 it had paid in legal fees for Guarino.                  Capital Video\n\nspent the remaining $423,101 between March 1 and December 1, 1996;\n\nit deducted this amount for its subchapter S corporation short\n\nfiscal year.       Guarino failed to report the payment of these legal\n\nfees as income.\n\n            The IRS sent notices of deficiency to both Capital Video\n\nand Guarino.        For Capital Video, the IRS disallowed the full\n\n$343,971 in legal fees that had been deducted as an ordinary and\n\nnecessary business expense for the C corporation fiscal year ending\n\nFebruary 29, 1996.4        For Guarino, the IRS assessed a tax deficiency\n\nfor his 1996 taxes.        The IRS treated the entire $343,971 paid               by\n\nCapital    Video    when    it   was   a   subchapter    C   corporation     as    a\n\nconstructive dividend to Guarino.              The IRS later conceded that\n\n$250,034 of those fees, though deducted in the corporate fiscal\n\nyear ending    February       1996,    were   actually   paid   in   1995;   they\n\ntherefore could not be counted as personal income for Guarino for\n\n1996.    The remainder of the deducted amount, $93,936, was spent in\n\nJanuary and February of 1996, part of the 1996 tax year for\n\nGuarino's personal tax purposes.               For the legal fees paid by\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       Subchapter S corporations do not pay income tax; they\ninstead pass through all of their income to their shareholders\nevery year. See I.R.C. §§ 1363(a), 1366(a). Thus, the validity of\nthe deduction did not affect Capital Video’s taxes once it elected\nS corporation status, but instead affected how much tax Guarino\npaid on the corporate disbursements.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fCapital Video    once    it   elected   S   corporation    status,    the   IRS\n\nincreased Guarino’s 1996 taxable ordinary income by $423,101.\n\n          Capital Video and Guarino sued in the U.S. Tax Court,\n\narguing that the conspiracy to evade payment of taxes was directly\n\nrelated to the tribute payments, which were themselves made to\n\nprotect and promote Capital Video’s business.               Therefore, they\n\nargued, the legal fees were properly deductible by Capital Video as\n\nordinary and necessary business expenses and should not be included\n\nin Guarino’s taxable income.          The tax court ruled for the IRS,\n\nfinding   that   the    petitioners     had   not    established     that   the\n\nconspiracy charge was sufficiently related to the protection and\n\npromotion of Capital Video, though it refused to apply I.R.C.\n\n§ 6662 penalties.

Memo LEXIS 42, *9-*10, *15 (Feb. 11, 2002).\n\nThis appeal timely followed.\n\n                                    II.\n\n          We review decisions of the tax court \"in the same manner\n\nand to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil\n\nactions tried without a jury.\"          I.R.C. § 7482(a)(1); see State\n\nPolice Ass’n v. Comm'r, 125 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997).                The tax\n\ncourt's legal interpretations are reviewed de novo.            Alexander v.\n\nIRS, 72 F.3d 938, 941 (1st Cir. 1995).                We will overturn its\n\nfactual findings only if they are clearly erroneous.                 Filios v.\n\nComm'r, 224 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2000).            The clear error standard\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fof review extends to factual findings \"based on inferences from\n\nstipulated facts.\" Medchem, Inc. v. Comm'r, 295 F.3d 118, 122 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).       A trial court’s finding is clearly erroneous when\n\n\"although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on\n\nthe entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction\n\nthat a mistake has been committed.\" Comm'r v. Duberstein, 363 U.S.\n\n278, 291 (1960) (quoting United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,\n\n333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948)).\n\n                                      III.\n\nA.    Deduction by Capital Video\n\n1.    The Legal Standard\n\n            The burden of proof is generally on the taxpayer to\n\ndemonstrate that the IRS's nondeductibility determination is in\n\nerror.     U.S. Tax Ct. R. 142(a); United States v. Janis, 428 U.S.\n\n433, 440 (1976).       Once \"a taxpayer introduces credible evidence\n\nwith respect to any factual issue,\" the burden shifts to the IRS on\n\nthat issue.      I.R.C. § 7491(a)(1).\n\n            Section 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code permits the\n\ndeduction of \"all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or\n\nincurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or\n\nbusiness.\"       Id. § 162(a).     To qualify as a § 162(a) deduction, an\n\nexpense must \"(1) be 'paid or incurred during the taxable year,'\n\n(2)   be   for    'carrying   on   any    trade   or   business,'   (3)   be   an\n\n'expense,' (4) be a 'necessary' expense, and (5) be an 'ordinary'\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fexpense.\"       Comm'r v. Lincoln Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 403 U.S. 345, 352\n\n(1971).     The phrase \"ordinary and necessary\" has a specialized\n\ndefinition in tax law.          The term \"necessary\" imposes \"only the\n\nminimal requirement that the expense be 'appropriate and helpful'\n\nfor 'the development of the [taxpayer's] business.'\"                Comm'r v.\n\nTellier, 383 U.S. 687, 689 (1966) (quoting Welch v. Helvering, 290\n\nU.S. 111, 113 (1933)).        Moreover, an expense need not be recurring\n\nin order to be considered ordinary under § 162(a):\n\n     Ordinary in this context does not mean that the payments must\n     be habitual or normal in the sense that the same taxpayer will\n     have to make them often. A lawsuit affecting the safety of a\n     business may happen once in a lifetime. The counsel fees may\n     be so heavy that repetition is unlikely. None the less, the\n     expense is an ordinary one because we know from experience\n     that payments for such a purpose, whether the amount is large\n     or small, are the common and accepted means of defense against\n     attack.\n\nWelch,    290    U.S.   at   114.   To   be   deductible   as   ordinary   and\n\nnecessary, an expense must be \"directly connected with\" or have\n\n\"proximately resulted from\" business activity.                  Kornhauser v.\n\nUnited States, 276 U.S. 145, 153 (1928). Whether an expenditure is\n\nordinary and necessary is usually a question of fact.               Comm'r v.\n\nHeininger, 320 U.S. 467, 475 (1943).\n\n            Legal fees paid to defend the business interests of a\n\ntaxpayer may normally be deducted under § 162(a).                Tellier, 383\n\nU.S. at 690.        Public policy does not prohibit the deduction of\n\nlegal fees relating to criminal activity so long as the legal fees\n\nare an ordinary and necessary expense of a trade or business.              Id.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fat 694-95; Heininger, 320 U.S. at 474. However, the payment of\n\nanother taxpayer's expenses generally is not deductible as a\n\nbusiness expense.    Welch, 290 U.S. at 114.   This principle extends\n\nto legal fees, which a taxpayer usually cannot deduct as a business\n\nexpense if the fees are for legal services provided to another.    J.\n\nGordon Turnbull, Inc. v. Comm'r, 41 T.C. 358, 378 (1963), aff'd,\n\n373 F.2d 87 (5th Cir. 1967).\n\n           This general rule, like many such rules, has a limited\n\nexception.    If the taxpayer pays the expenses of another in order\n\nto promote the paying taxpayer's business interests, the payment\n\nmay sometimes be deductible as an ordinary and necessary business\n\nexpense.     See Gould v. Comm'r, 64 T.C. 132, 134-35 (1975).     The\n\nrelevant test is that of Lohrke v. Commissioner, 48 T.C. 679\n\n(1967), which the parties agree applies.       The test is twofold:\n\nFirst, the tax court must \"ascertain the purpose or motive which\n\ncause[d] the taxpayer to pay the obligations of the other person.\"\n\nId. at 688.    To meet this prong, the expense must have been made\n\nprimarily to benefit the taxpayer's business; any benefit conferred\n\non the party whose expenses are being paid must be only incidental.\n\nAMW Invs., Inc. v. Comm'r, No. 3901-94, 1996 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS\n\n255, at *13-*14 (May 22, 1996).    Second, the tax court \"must then\n\njudge whether it is an ordinary and necessary expense of the\n\n[taxpayer's] trade or business; that is, is it an appropriate\n\nexpenditure for the furtherance or promotion of that trade or\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fbusiness?     If so, the expense is deductible by the individual\n\npaying it.\"     Lohrke, 48 T.C. at 688.\n\n             The second prong of this test, as applied to legal\n\nexpenses, reflects the focus on the origin of the subject of\n\nlitigation, and not on the consequences to the taxpayer.            United\n\nStates v. Gilmore, 372 U.S. 39, 48 (1963) (\"[T]he characterization,\n\nas 'business' or 'personal,' of the litigation costs of resisting\n\na claim depends on whether or not the claim arises in connection\n\nwith the taxpayer's profit-seeking activities.          It does not depend\n\non the consequences that might result . . . .\") (emphasis in\n\noriginal).         A corporation may not pay the legal expenses of an\n\nindispensable employee merely on the rationale that the employee\n\nmay otherwise lose his case and be imprisoned, with disastrous\n\nresults to the corporation.           Jack's Maint. Contractors, Inc. v.\n\nComm'r, 703 F.2d 154, 156-57 (5th Cir. 1983) (per curiam).\n\n             Were the contrary rule adopted, businesses could deduct\n\nall manner of personal expenses paid on behalf of indispensable\n\nemployees as long as the expenses were necessary to keep them\n\nemployed; such a rule \"would be far too broad.\"           Id. at 157; see\n\nalso Cummins Diesel Sales, Inc. v. United States, 207 F. Supp. 746,\n\n748-49 (D. Or. 1962), aff'd, 321 F.2d 503 (9th Cir. 1963) (denying\n\na corporate deduction for the wages of a nurse whose care was\n\nnecessary     to    the   principal   officer   and   shareholder   of   the\n\ncorporation).        In order to prevent this small exception from\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fthrowing open the floodgates of corporate deduction, the second\n\nprong of the Lohrke test requires that the expense arise in\n\nconnection with the business activities of the taxpayer paying the\n\nexpense.   See Lohrke, 48 T.C. at 688; see also Gilmore, 372 U.S. at\n\n48; Kornhauser, 276 U.S. at 153.\n\n2.   Factual Analysis\n\n           The taxpayers concede that the tax court articulated the\n\ncorrect principles of law, but argue that these principles were\n\nincorrectly applied to the facts.      The tax court found that there\n\nwas insufficient evidence under the \"ordinary and necessary\" second\n\nprong of the Lohrke test.     It found no evidence \"that indicates\n\nthat Richichi would not have provided the protection to Capital\n\nVideo if Guarino had not participated in the conspiracy relating to\n\nRichichi's taxes and if Capital Video had not paid Guarino's legal\n\nfees.\"     Capital Video, 2002 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 42, at *10.\n\nTherefore, the petitioners had \"not established that Guarino's\n\nparticipation in the conspiracy . . . and Capital Video's payment\n\nof the legal fees in dispute had a sufficient business relationship\n\nwith the protection or promotion of Capital Video's business.\" Id.\n\n           For Capital Video to deduct the legal fees paid for\n\nGuarino's criminal defense, it is not enough to argue that its\n\nbusiness would be in danger if Guarino were convicted of the crimes\n\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fof which he was accused.5              It is not enough for Capital Video to\n\nargue that its decision to pay for Guarino's legal fees was made\n\nprimarily for business reasons.               When, as here, the corporation\n\npays the legal expenses of a sole shareholder, it may be difficult\n\nto   disentangle       the    motive    of   the   business   from   that   of   the\n\nshareholder.       Instead, Capital Video must also prove that the\n\norigin of the expense, here Guarino's criminal conspiracy activity,\n\narose in connection with, or proximately resulted from, Capital\n\nVideo's business activities.             Gilmore, 372 U.S. at 48.\n\n             There is no clear error in the tax court's factual\n\nfinding that the petitioners failed to establish that the expense\n\nwas an ordinary and necessary one.                 Simply put, the petitioners\n\npresented no evidence that the criminal charge, the conspiracy to\n\navoid paying Richichi's taxes (even ignoring the other charges),\n\nwas sufficiently related to Capital Video.                No one testified, for\n\nexample, that the protection Richichi offered would not be provided\n\nhad Guarino not helped to hide the tribute payments, or that such\n\ntax conspiracies are an integral part of tribute payments to\n\norganized crime networks.              There was nothing in the record that\n\nrequired the tax court to make a finding that the conspiracy was\n\nrelated to the promotion of Capital Video's business.                  The burden\n\nof   proof   is   on    the    taxpayer;     had   the   petitioners   introduced\n\n\n\n      5\n       In fact, the sales and resulting profits of Capital Video\nactually increased while Guarino was incarcerated.\n\n                                          -14-\n\fcredible evidence on this point, the burden would have been shifted\n\nto the IRS, I.R.C. § 7491(a), but no such evidence was introduced.\n\n          The petitioners maintain that even though there was no\n\ndirect evidence requiring a contrary conclusion, it was clear error\n\nfor the tax court to refuse to make a \"common-sense inference\" that\n\nthe tax conspiracy was a necessary part of the tribute payment\n\nscheme.   They argue that the underlying payment of protection was\n\nan ordinary and necessary expense of Capital Video and that a crime\n\nnecessarily carries with it a cover-up, and so the cover-up must\n\nalso be an ordinary and necessary expense.     There were more than\n\nadequate grounds to refuse to make such an inference.\n\n           We hold6 there was a fatal lack of evidence regarding the\n\nrelationship between the tribute payments, the tax conspiracy, and\n\nCapital Video.    While Capital Video may have benefitted from\n\nRichichi's protection, there was no evidence presented as to what\n\nservices Richichi provided Capital Video.      It is impossible to\n\nascertain from the record whether Capital Video was a primary or\n\neven a significant beneficiary of the services, if any, exchanged\n\n\n     6\n       As background, we note that the indictments accused Guarino\nof four means of engaging in criminal misconduct, only one of which\nreferenced or involved Capital Video in any way. The other three\ninvolved other pornography distribution enterprises and Guarino's\nLas Vegas show.    The legal fees were paid to lawyers who were\ndefending Guarino against all of these charges. The mere fact that\nGuarino pled guilty to only the conspiracy charge of the second\nsuperseding indictment, which described conduct linked to Capital\nVideo as well as other conduct, does not transform the legal fees\npaid to resolve all of these criminal indictments into expenses\ndeductible by Capital Video.\n\n                                -15-\n\ffor the tribute payments.       Furthermore, no evidence was introduced\n\nthat the effectiveness of the tribute payments depended on the\n\nresulting tax conspiracy.       In light of these gaps in the evidence,\n\nthe taxpayers did not show that the tribute payments were ordinary\n\nand necessary expenses of Capital Video.           Even if the tax court did\n\nmake an inference linking the tribute payments to the conspiracy\n\ncharge, as the petitioners request, that inference itself would not\n\nresult in a finding that the legal fees were deductible, because\n\nthe tribute payments themselves are not clearly linked to the\n\nbusiness of Capital Video.       We cannot say the tax court committed\n\nclear error in rejecting the hypothesis that the tribute payments,\n\nas to Capital Video, necessitated the cover up which resulted in\n\none of the criminal charges in the absence of evidence of this\n\nrelationship.\n\n              In sum, the tax court did not commit clear error by\n\nrefusing to find that the payment of legal fees was an ordinary and\n\nnecessary business expense by Capital Video. The deductions do not\n\nmeet the second prong of the Lohrke test.          Accordingly, we need not\n\nreach the question of the motive for the payments under Lohrke's\n\nfirst prong.\n\nB.   Income to Guarino\n\n              Once the tax court determined that the $423,101 in legal\n\nfees   paid    by   Capital   Video   after   it   became   a   subchapter   S\n\ncorporation were not deductible, \"such adjustment mechanically\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fresults in additional income to Guarino in that same amount as a\n\nresult of the corresponding increase in Guarino's share of the\n\nincome of Capital Video, as an S corporation.\" Capital Video, 2002\n\nTax Ct. Memo LEXIS 42, at *12.             Subchapter S corporations do not\n\nretain    profits    or    losses    but     instead      pass   them    to   their\n\nshareholders every year.            See I.R.C. § 1366(a).               Once it is\n\ndetermined   that    the   legal    fees     were   not    deductible     business\n\nexpenses, Capital Video's S corporation taxable income is increased\n\nby $423,101.     Guarino, as the sole shareholder, must pay taxes on\n\nthat amount as personal income. This result depends not on whether\n\nthat money was spent for his benefit; instead, it flows directly\n\nfrom the pass-through nature of S corporation status.\n\n           The tax court also concluded that the $93,936 in legal\n\nfees paid during calendar year 1996 while Capital Video was a\n\nsubchapter C corporation should be construed as a constructive\n\ndividend to Guarino, and that he thus owed tax on that amount as\n\nwell.    Capital Video, 2002 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 42, at *11-*12; see\n\nHadley v. Comm'r, 36 F.2d 543, 545 (D.C. Cir. 1929); Hood v.\n\nComm'r, 115 T.C. 172, 180 (2000); Magnon v. Comm'r, 73 T.C. 980,\n\n993-94 (1980).      Guarino has not challenged this holding on appeal;\n\nhe disputes the finding of a constructive dividend solely by\n\narguing that the legal expenses were deductible by Capital Video.\n\nBecause we find otherwise, that portion spent by Capital Video as\n\na subchapter C corporation constitutes a constructive dividend and\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fis   therefore   taxable   to   Guarino    as   ordinary   income.   I.R.C.\n\n§ 61(a)(7).\n\nC.   Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions\n\n            Finally, Guarino argues that he should be able to deduct\n\nthe legal expenses as miscellaneous itemized business expense\n\ndeductions under I.R.C. § 162(a).         He claims that if the legal fees\n\npaid by Capital Video are to be taxable to him, then those legal\n\nfees should be considered to have been paid by him directly;\n\nmoreover, he argues, once the legal fees are treated as his\n\nexpense, he should be able to deduct them as a business expense.\n\nThe tax court held that Guarino had not shown that the legal\n\nexpenses were sufficiently related to a trade or business. Capital\n\nVideo, 2002 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 42, at *13.             There was no clear\n\nerror in this holding.\n\n            Section 162(a) permits deductions by individuals as well\n\nas by corporations for \"ordinary and necessary expenses paid or\n\nincurred . . . in carrying on any trade or business.\"                I.R.C.\n\n§ 162(a).   Individuals may deduct legal expenses under § 162(a) if\n\nthey are sufficiently related to the taxpayer's business. Tellier,\n\n383 U.S. at 689.    The appropriate test is whether the \"origin and\n\ncharacter of the claim with respect to which an expense was\n\nincurred\" is business or personal.          Gilmore, 372 U.S. at 49.\n\n            To meet the ordinary and necessary § 162(a) standard for\n\ndeductibility from his personal taxes, Guarino need not show that\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fthe   criminal    activity        originated   with   Capital    Video;     the\n\nrelationships with his other business ventures, including the\n\nprecious metals business and the Las Vegas show which were also\n\nprotected and aided by Richichi, are also relevant.              Ultimately,\n\nhowever, Guarino did not show that the legal defense fees were\n\nordinary and necessary business expenses, even considering the\n\nentirety of his business enterprises.          The failings are similar to\n\nthose set forth in the analysis of Capital Video's deduction.\n\nGuarino   did    not   show   a    link   between   the   protection   of   the\n\nbusinesses and the tax conspiracy in which he engaged; there was no\n\nevidence that the latter was an integral part of securing the\n\nformer.   Moreover, the indictment alleged, and the plea agreement\n\nacknowledged, conduct beyond merely hiding the tribute payments\n\nfrom the government.      There was no clear error in the finding that\n\nthe legal fees are not deductible by Guarino under § 162(a).\n\n\n\n           The judgment of the tax court against both Capital Video\n\nand Guarino is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\f",

The petitioners, a corporation and the sole shareholder of that corporation, were sent tax deficiency notices by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on April 24, 2000, in the sum of $116,950.00 for the corporation and $312,874.00 for the individual, plus penalties under I.R.C. &#167; 6662. Both of the deficiency notices stemmed from legal fees relating to the defense of a federal criminal indictment against Kenneth Guarino. The legal fees were paid and then deducted by the corporation, Capital Video Corporation, and were not counted as income by Guarino, the corporation's sole shareholder. Petitioners argue that the criminal conduct was so related to the operation of the corporation that the legal fees were a deductible corporate expense and properly not included in Guarino's gross income. The tax court disagreed, finding that the criminal charges were not sufficiently related to the operation of the corporation. We affirm the ruling of the tax court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These facts are derived from the joint stipulated facts and from the exhibits, which were stipulated to be authentic.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The parties rested on only these facts and exhibits before the tax court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1979, Kenneth Guarino created and incorporated Capital Video Corporation, located in Cranston, Rhode Island; Guarino was the sole shareholder. Capital Video was a distributor of pornographic videotapes. Guarino was associated with Natale Richichi, a capo in the Gambino family of La Cosa Nostra, who dealt directly with the bosses of both the Gambino and Patriarca families and had influence with other factions of La Cosa Nostra. Guarino was concerned that members of other organized crime families would extort money from, or take over, his multimillion dollar business. He also worried that organized crime would interfere with his other business ventures, including a show at the Dunes Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, called \"Night Dreams,\" and a precious metals business in the New England area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guarino in 1979 began to pay \"tribute\" to Richichi to fend off extortion attempts and to assist Guarino with other business matters where Richichi's influence as a capo might benefit Guarino. This included protection for the Night Dreams production and the precious metals business in New England, and for influence with various union officials. The payments averaged between eight and ten thousand dollars twice per month. The total amount of the payments is in dispute, but between July 1985 and September 1995, Guarino paid Richichi at least $1,728,000 in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A substantial portion of Richichi's income came from Guarino's payments, and Richichi was not otherwise lawfully employed. Richichi worried that the IRS would become aware of and attempt to tax his substantial income and assets. As a result, Richichi and Guarino made arrangements to conceal the tribute payments from the IRS. The payments were always made in cash. While some of the funds were paid by Capital Video, these payments were kept off of its accounting books. Some payments were hidden by skimming funds from the profits of Capital Video's video booth and peep show machines; Capital Video generated false Forms 1099 so that it appeared that the skimmed profits were instead flowing to Guarino and a nominee owner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Other funds from Capital Video were reported as loans and dividends to nominee owners; Capital Video's bookkeeper, Guarino's former mother-in-law, would write these loan and dividend checks and cash them herself. Guarino also provided Richichi with a Capital Video credit card, had Capital Video lease Mercedes-Benz automobiles for him and for his daughter, and paid for health insurance coverage for Richichi and his wife under Capital Video's employee plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from helping to hide the tribute payments from the IRS, Guarino also helped Richichi hide other assets. For instance, Guarino advised Richichi on the details of how to hide his ownership of property in the Dominican Republic by using a corporation and nominee owners. He also offered to help conceal Richichi's interest in property more directly, though there were no allegations that Guarino actually served in anything more than an advisory capacity with regard to Richichi's other assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1992, Guarino and Richichi, along with another defendant, were indicted by a federal grand jury on one count of conspiring to bribe an official of the stagehands union in connection with Guarino's Las Vegas show. In August 1994, Guarino and Richichi were indicted with three others in a superseding indictment. Count One alleged a conspiracy to \"defraud the United States by impeding, impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful government functions of the [IRS] in the ascertainment, computation, assessment, and collection of federal income taxes owed by\" Richichi. Count Two reiterated the allegation of conspiracy to bribe a union official. Finally, in August 1995 Guarino and Richichi were again indicted under a second superseding indictment for both of these counts, and they were also each separately indicted for several counts of interstate transportation of obscene material through the use of a common carrier, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1462, and aiding and abetting that crime under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1997, Guarino, as part of a plea agreement, pled guilty only to the charge of conspiracy to evade taxes. He was sentenced to sixteen months in prison, eleven of which were served in a halfway house, and fined $250,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capital Video was a subchapter C corporation whose fiscal year began on March 1. On March 1, 1996, Capital Video elected to be treated instead as a subchapter S corporation. This change in status meant, among other things, that its fiscal year needed to match the calendar year. As a result, Capital Video's first fiscal year as a subchapter S corporation was a short one, lasting from March 1 to December 31, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the calendar years 1995 and 1996, Capital Video, out of its corporate funds, paid for all of the legal defense fees for Guarino stemming from all of these criminal indictments. Capital Video paid $250,034 in fees during calendar year 1995 and $517,038 in fees during calendar year 1996, for a total of $767,072. Of that amount, Capital Video spent $343,971 between March 1, 1995 and February 29, 1996, when it was a C corporation. For the C corporation fiscal year ending February 29, 1996, Capital Video deducted as ordinary and necessary business expenses the $343,971 it had paid in legal fees for Guarino. Capital Video spent the remaining $423,101 between March 1 and December 1, 1996; it deducted this amount for its subchapter S corporation short fiscal year. Guarino failed to report the payment of these legal fees as income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS sent notices of deficiency to both Capital Video and Guarino. For Capital Video, the IRS disallowed the full $343,971 in legal fees that had been deducted as an ordinary and necessary business expense for the C corporation fiscal year ending February 29, 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For Guarino, the IRS assessed a tax deficiency for his 1996 taxes. The IRS treated the entire $343,971 paid by Capital Video when it was a subchapter C corporation as a constructive dividend to Guarino. The IRS later conceded that $250,034 of those fees, though deducted in the corporate fiscal year ending February 1996, were actually paid in 1995; they therefore could not be counted as personal income for Guarino for 1996. The remainder of the deducted amount, $93,936, was spent in January and February of 1996, part of the 1996 tax year for Guarino's personal tax purposes. For the legal fees paid by Capital Video once it elected S corporation status, the IRS increased Guarino's 1996 taxable ordinary income by $423,101.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capital Video and Guarino sued in the U.S. Tax Court, arguing that the conspiracy to evade payment of taxes was directly related to the tribute payments, which were themselves made to protect and promote Capital Video's business. Therefore, they argued, the legal fees were properly deductible by Capital Video as ordinary and necessary business expenses and should not be included in Guarino's taxable income. The tax court ruled for the IRS, finding that the petitioners had not established that the conspiracy charge was sufficiently related to the protection and promotion of Capital Video, though it refused to apply I.R.C. &#167; 6662 penalties. <i>Capital Video Corp. v.

Lincoln Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n,</i> 403 U.S. 345, 352, 91 S.Ct. 1893, 29 L.Ed.2d 519 (1971). The phrase \"ordinary and necessary\" has a specialized definition in tax law. The term \"necessary\" imposes \"only the minimal requirement that the expense be `appropriate and helpful' for `the development of the [taxpayer's] business.'\" <i>Comm'r v. Tellier,</i> 383 U.S. 687, 689, 86 S.Ct. 1118, 16 L.Ed.2d 185 (1966) (quoting <i>Welch v. Helvering,</i> 290 U.S. 111, 113, 54 S.Ct. 8, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933)). Moreover, an expense need not be recurring in order to be considered ordinary under &#167; 162(a):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinary in this context does not mean that the payments must be habitual or normal in the sense that the same taxpayer will have to make them often. A lawsuit affecting the safety of a business may happen once in a lifetime. The counsel fees may be so heavy that repetition is unlikely. None the less, the expense is an ordinary one because we know from experience that payments for such a purpose, whether the amount is large or small, are the common and accepted means of defense against attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Welch,</i> 290 U.S. at 114, 54 S.Ct. 8. To be deductible as ordinary and necessary, an expense must be \"directly connected with\" or have \"proximately resulted from\" business activity. <i>Kornhauser v. United States,</i> 276 U.S. 145, 153, 48 S.Ct. 219, 72 L.Ed. 505 (1928). Whether an expenditure is ordinary and necessary is usually a question of fact. <i>Comm'r v. Heininger,</i> 320 U.S. 467, 475, 64 S.Ct. 249, 88 L.Ed. 171 (1943).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Legal fees paid to defend the business interests of a taxpayer may normally be deducted under &#167; 162(a). <i>Tellier,</i> 383 U.S. at 690, 86 S.Ct. 1118. Public policy does not prohibit the deduction of legal fees relating to criminal activity so long as the legal fees are an ordinary and necessary expense of a trade or business. <i>Id.</i> at 694-95, 86 S.Ct. 1118; <i>Heininger,</i> 320 U.S. at 474, 64 S.Ct. 249. However, the payment of another taxpayer's expenses generally is not deductible as a business expense. <i>Welch,</i> 290 U.S. at 114, 54 S.Ct. 8. This principle extends to legal fees, which a taxpayer usually cannot deduct as a business expense if the fees are for legal services provided to another. <i>J. Gordon Turnbull, Inc. v. Comm'r,</i> 41 T.C. 358, 378, 1963 WL 1607 (1963), <i>aff'd,</i> 373 F.2d 87 (5th Cir.1967).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This general rule, like many such rules, has a limited exception. If the taxpayer pays the expenses of another in order to promote the paying taxpayer's business interests, the payment may sometimes be deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense. <i>See Gould v. Comm'r,</i> 64 T.C. 132, 134-35, 1975 WL 3011 (1975). The relevant test is that of <i>Lohrke v. Commissioner,</i> 48 T.C. 679, 1967 WL 977 (1967), which the parties agree applies. The test is twofold: First, the tax court must \"ascertain the purpose or motive which cause[d] the taxpayer to pay the obligations of the other person.\" <i>Id.</i> at 688. To meet this prong, the expense must have been made primarily to benefit the taxpayer's business; any benefit conferred on the party whose expenses are being paid must be only incidental. <i>AMW Invs., Inc. v. Comm'r,</i> No. 3901-94, 1996 WL 270942, 1996 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 255, at *13-*14 (May 22, 1996). Second, the tax court \"must then judge whether it is an ordinary and necessary expense of the [taxpayer's] trade or business; that is, is it an appropriate expenditure for the furtherance or promotion of that trade or business? If so, the expense is deductible by the individual paying it.\" <i>Lohrke,</i> 48 T.C. at 688.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong of this test, as applied to legal expenses, reflects the focus on the origin of the subject of litigation, and not on the consequences to the taxpayer. <i>United States v. Gilmore,</i> 372 U.S. 39, 48, 83 S.Ct. 623, 9 L.Ed.2d 570 (1963) (\"[T]he characterization, as `business' or `personal,' of the litigation costs of resisting a claim depends on whether or not the claim <i>arises in connection with</i> the taxpayer's profit-seeking activities. It does not depend on the <i>consequences</i> that might result....\") (emphasis in original). A corporation may not pay the legal expenses of an indispensable employee merely on the rationale that the employee may otherwise lose his case and be imprisoned, with disastrous results to the corporation. <i>Jack's Maint. Contractors, Inc. v. Comm'r,</i> 703 F.2d 154, 156-57 (5th Cir.1983) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were the contrary rule adopted, businesses could deduct all manner of personal expenses paid on behalf of indispensable employees as long as the expenses were necessary to keep them employed; such a rule \"would be far too broad.\" <i>Id.</i> at 157; <i>see also Cummins Diesel Sales, Inc. v. United States,</i> 207 F.Supp. 746, 748-49 (D.Or.1962), <i>aff'd,</i> 321 F.2d 503 (9th Cir.1963) (denying a corporate deduction for the wages of a nurse whose care was necessary to the principal officer and shareholder of the corporation). In order to prevent this small exception from throwing open the floodgates of corporate deduction, the second prong of the <i>Lohrke</i> test requires that the expense arise in connection with the business activities of the taxpayer paying the expense. <i>See Lohrke,</i> 48 T.C. at 688; <i>see also Gilmore,</i> 372 U.S. at 48, 83 S.Ct. 623; <i>Kornhauser,</i> 276 U.S. at 153, 48 S.Ct. 219.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Factual Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The taxpayers concede that the tax court articulated the correct principles of law, but argue that these principles were incorrectly applied to the facts. The tax court found that there was insufficient evidence under the \"ordinary and necessary\" second prong of the <i>Lohrke</i> test. It found no evidence \"that indicates that Richichi would not have provided the protection to Capital Video if Guarino had not participated in the conspiracy relating to Richichi's taxes and if Capital Video had not paid Guarino's legal fees.\" <i>Capital Video,</i> 2002 WL 205654, 2002 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 42, at *10. Therefore, the petitioners had \"not established that Guarino's participation in the conspiracy ... and Capital Video's payment of the legal fees in dispute had a sufficient business relationship with the protection or promotion of Capital Video's business.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For Capital Video to deduct the legal fees paid for Guarino's criminal defense, it is not enough to argue that its business would be in danger if Guarino were convicted of the crimes of which he was accused.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> It is not enough for Capital Video to argue that its decision to pay for Guarino's legal fees was made primarily for business reasons. When, as here, the corporation pays the legal expenses of a sole shareholder, it may be difficult to disentangle the motive of the business from that of the shareholder. Instead, Capital Video must also prove that the origin of the expense, here Guarino's criminal conspiracy activity, arose in connection with, or proximately resulted from, Capital Video's business activities. <i>Gilmore,</i> 372 U.S. at 48, 83 S.Ct. 623.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no clear error in the tax court's factual finding that the petitioners failed to establish that the expense was an ordinary and necessary one. Simply put, the petitioners presented no evidence that the criminal charge, the conspiracy to avoid paying Richichi's taxes (even ignoring the other charges), was sufficiently related to Capital Video. No one testified, for example, that the protection Richichi offered would not be provided had Guarino not helped to hide the tribute payments, or that such tax conspiracies are an integral part of tribute payments to organized crime networks. There was nothing in the record that required the tax court to make a finding that the conspiracy was related to the promotion of Capital Video's business. The burden of proof is on the taxpayer; had the petitioners introduced credible evidence on this point, the burden would have been shifted to the IRS, I.R.C. &#167; 7491(a), but no such evidence was introduced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners maintain that even though there was no direct evidence requiring a contrary conclusion, it was clear error for the tax court to refuse to make a \"common-sense inference\" that the tax conspiracy was a necessary part of the tribute payment scheme. They argue that the underlying payment of protection was an ordinary and necessary expense of Capital Video and that a crime necessarily carries with it a cover-up, and so the cover-up must also be an ordinary and necessary expense. There were more than adequate grounds to refuse to make such an inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> there was a fatal lack of evidence regarding the relationship between the tribute payments, the tax conspiracy, and Capital Video. While Capital Video may have benefitted from Richichi's protection, there was no evidence presented as to what services Richichi provided Capital Video. It is impossible to ascertain from the record whether Capital Video was a primary or even a significant beneficiary of the services, if any, exchanged for the tribute payments. Furthermore, no evidence was introduced that the effectiveness of the tribute payments depended on the resulting tax conspiracy. In light of these gaps in the evidence, the taxpayers did not show that the tribute payments were ordinary and necessary expenses of Capital Video. Even if the tax court did make an inference linking the tribute payments to the conspiracy charge, as the petitioners request, that inference itself would not result in a finding that the legal fees were deductible, because the tribute payments themselves are not clearly linked to the business of Capital Video. We cannot say the tax court committed clear error in rejecting the hypothesis that the tribute payments, as to Capital Video, necessitated the cover up which resulted in one of the criminal charges in the absence of evidence of this relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the tax court did not commit clear error by refusing to find that the payment of legal fees was an ordinary and necessary business expense by Capital Video. The deductions do not meet the second prong of the <i>Lohrke</i> test. Accordingly, we need not reach the question of the motive for the payments under <i>Lohrke</i>'s first prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Income to Guarino</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the tax court determined that the $423,101 in legal fees paid by Capital Video after it became a subchapter S corporation were not deductible, \"such adjustment mechanically results in additional income to Guarino in that same amount as a result of the corresponding increase in Guarino's share of the income of Capital Video, as an S corporation.\" <i>Capital Video,</i> 2002 WL 205654, 2002 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 42, at *12. Subchapter S corporations do not retain profits or losses but instead pass them to their shareholders every year. <i>See</i> I.R.C. &#167; 1366(a). Once it is determined that the legal fees were not deductible business expenses, Capital Video's S corporation taxable income is increased by $423,101. Guarino, as the sole shareholder, must pay taxes on that amount as personal income. This result depends not on whether that money was spent for his benefit; instead, it flows directly from the pass-through nature of S corporation status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax court also concluded that the $93,936 in legal fees paid during calendar year 1996 while Capital Video was a subchapter C corporation should be construed as a constructive dividend to Guarino, and that he thus owed tax on that amount as well. <i>Capital Video,</i> 2002 WL 205654, 2002 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 42, at *11-*12; <i>see Hadley v. Comm'r,</i> 36 F.2d 543, 545 (D.C.Cir.1929); <i>Hood v. Comm'r,</i> 115 T.C. 172, 180, 2000 WL 1206813 (2000); <i>Magnon v. Comm'r,</i> 73 T.C. 980, 993-94, 1980 WL 4560 (1980). Guarino has not challenged this holding on appeal; he disputes the finding of a constructive dividend solely by arguing that the legal expenses were deductible by Capital Video. Because we find otherwise, that portion spent by Capital Video as a subchapter C corporation constitutes a constructive dividend and is therefore taxable to Guarino as ordinary income. I.R.C. &#167; 61(a)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Guarino argues that he should be able to deduct the legal expenses as miscellaneous itemized business expense deductions under I.R.C. &#167; 162(a). He claims that if the legal fees paid by Capital Video are to be taxable to him, then those legal fees should be considered to have been paid by him directly; moreover, he argues, once the legal fees are treated as his expense, he should be able to deduct them as a business expense. The tax court held that Guarino had not shown that the legal expenses were sufficiently related to a trade or business. <i>Capital Video,</i> 2002 WL 205654, 2002 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 42, at *13. There was no clear error in this holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 162(a) permits deductions by individuals as well as by corporations for \"ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred ... in carrying on any trade or business.\" I.R.C. &#167; 162(a). Individuals may deduct legal expenses under &#167; 162(a) if they are sufficiently related to the taxpayer's business. <i>Tellier,</i> 383 U.S. at 689, 86 S.Ct. 1118. The appropriate test is whether the \"origin and character of the claim with respect to which an expense was incurred\" is business or personal. <i>Gilmore,</i> 372 U.S. at 49, 83 S.Ct. 623.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To meet the ordinary and necessary &#167; 162(a) standard for deductibility from his personal taxes, Guarino need not show that the criminal activity originated with Capital Video; the relationships with his other business ventures, including the precious metals business and the Las Vegas show which were also protected and aided by Richichi, are also relevant. Ultimately, however, Guarino did not show that the legal defense fees were ordinary and necessary business expenses, even considering the entirety of his business enterprises. The failings are similar to those set forth in the analysis of Capital Video's deduction. Guarino did not show a link between the protection of the businesses and the tax conspiracy in which he engaged; there was no evidence that the latter was an integral part of securing the former. Moreover, the indictment alleged, and the plea agreement acknowledged, conduct beyond merely hiding the tribute payments from the government. There was no clear error in the finding that the legal fees are not deductible by Guarino under &#167; 162(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the tax court against both Capital Video and Guarino is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Some facts are taken from Guarino's plea agreement.

The mere fact that Guarino pled guilty to only the conspiracy charge of the second superseding indictment, which described conduct linked to Capital Video as well as other conduct, does not transform the legal fees paid to resolve all of these criminal indictments into expenses deductible by Capital Video</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The petitioners, a corporation and the sole shareholder of that corporation, were sent tax deficiency notices by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on April 24, 2000, in the sum of $116,950.00 for the corporation and $312,874.00 for the individual, plus penalties under I.R.C. &#167; 6662. Both of the deficiency notices stemmed from legal fees relating to the defense of a federal criminal indictment against Kenneth Guarino. The legal fees were paid and then deducted by the corporation, Capital Video Corporation, and were not counted as income by Guarino, the corporation's sole shareholder. Petitioners argue that the criminal conduct was so related to the operation of the corporation that the legal fees were a deductible corporate expense and properly not included in Guarino's gross income. The tax court disagreed, finding that the criminal charges were not sufficiently related to the operation of the corporation. We affirm the ruling of the tax court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These facts are derived from the joint stipulated facts and from the exhibits, which were stipulated to be authentic.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The parties rested on only these facts and exhibits before the tax court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1979, Kenneth Guarino created and incorporated Capital Video Corporation, located in Cranston, Rhode Island; Guarino was the sole shareholder. Capital Video was a distributor of pornographic videotapes. Guarino was associated with Natale Richichi, a capo in the Gambino family of La Cosa Nostra, who dealt directly with the bosses of both the Gambino and Patriarca families and had influence with other factions of La Cosa Nostra. Guarino was concerned that members of other organized crime families would extort money from, or take over, his multimillion dollar business. He also worried that organized crime would interfere with his other business ventures, including a show at the Dunes Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, called \"Night Dreams,\" and a precious metals business in the New England area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guarino in 1979 began to pay \"tribute\" to Richichi to fend off extortion attempts and to assist Guarino with other business matters where Richichi's influence as a capo might benefit Guarino. This included protection for the Night Dreams production and the precious metals business in New England, and for influence with various union officials. The payments averaged between eight and ten thousand dollars twice per month. The total amount of the payments is in dispute, but between July 1985 and September 1995, Guarino paid Richichi at least $1,728,000 in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A substantial portion of Richichi's income came from Guarino's payments, and Richichi was not otherwise lawfully employed. Richichi worried that the IRS would become aware of and attempt to tax his substantial income and assets. As a result, Richichi and Guarino made arrangements to conceal the tribute payments from the IRS. The payments were always made in cash. While some of the funds were paid by Capital Video, these payments were kept off of its accounting books. Some payments were hidden by skimming funds from the profits of Capital Video's video booth and peep show machines; Capital Video generated false Forms 1099 so that it appeared that the skimmed profits were instead flowing to Guarino and a nominee owner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Other funds from Capital Video were reported as loans and dividends to nominee owners; Capital Video's bookkeeper, Guarino's former mother-in-law, would write these loan and dividend checks and cash them herself. Guarino also provided Richichi with a Capital Video credit card, had Capital Video lease Mercedes-Benz automobiles for him and for his daughter, and paid for health insurance coverage for Richichi and his wife under Capital Video's employee plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from helping to hide the tribute payments from the IRS, Guarino also helped Richichi hide other assets. For instance, Guarino advised Richichi on the details of how to hide his ownership of property in the Dominican Republic by using a corporation and nominee owners. He also offered to help conceal Richichi's interest in property more directly, though there were no allegations that Guarino actually served in anything more than an advisory capacity with regard to Richichi's other assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1992, Guarino and Richichi, along with another defendant, were indicted by a federal grand jury on one count of conspiring to bribe an official of the stagehands union in connection with Guarino's Las Vegas show. In August 1994, Guarino and Richichi were indicted with three others in a superseding indictment. Count One alleged a conspiracy to \"defraud the United States by impeding, impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful government functions of the [IRS] in the ascertainment, computation, assessment, and collection of federal income taxes owed by\" Richichi. Count Two reiterated the allegation of conspiracy to bribe a union official. Finally, in August 1995 Guarino and Richichi were again indicted under a second superseding indictment for both of these counts, and they were also each separately indicted for several counts of interstate transportation of obscene material through the use of a common carrier, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1462, and aiding and abetting that crime under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1997, Guarino, as part of a plea agreement, pled guilty only to the charge of conspiracy to evade taxes.

On March 1, 1996, Capital Video elected to be treated instead as a subchapter S corporation. This change in status meant, among other things, that its fiscal year needed to match the calendar year. As a result, Capital Video's first fiscal year as a subchapter S corporation was a short one, lasting from March 1 to December 31, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the calendar years 1995 and 1996, Capital Video, out of its corporate funds, paid for all of the legal defense fees for Guarino stemming from all of these criminal indictments. Capital Video paid $250,034 in fees during calendar year 1995 and $517,038 in fees during calendar year 1996, for a total of $767,072. Of that amount, Capital Video spent $343,971 between March 1, 1995 and February 29, 1996, when it was a C corporation. For the C corporation fiscal year ending February 29, 1996, Capital Video deducted as ordinary and necessary business expenses the $343,971 it had paid in legal fees for Guarino. Capital Video spent the remaining $423,101 between March 1 and December 1, 1996; it deducted this amount for its subchapter S corporation short fiscal year. Guarino failed to report the payment of these legal fees as income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS sent notices of deficiency to both Capital Video and Guarino.

The IRS treated the entire $343,971 paid by Capital Video when it was a subchapter C corporation as a constructive dividend to Guarino. The IRS later conceded that $250,034 of those fees, though deducted in the corporate fiscal year ending February 1996, were actually paid in 1995; they therefore could not be counted as personal income for Guarino for 1996. The remainder of the deducted amount, $93,936, was spent in January and February of 1996, part of the 1996 tax year for Guarino's personal tax purposes. For the legal fees paid by Capital Video once it elected S corporation status, the IRS increased Guarino's 1996 taxable ordinary income by $423,101.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capital Video and Guarino sued in the U.S. Tax Court, arguing that the conspiracy to evade payment of taxes was directly related to the tribute payments, which were themselves made to protect and promote Capital Video's business. Therefore, they argued, the legal fees were properly deductible by Capital Video as ordinary and necessary business expenses and should not be included in Guarino's taxable income. The tax court ruled for the IRS, finding that the petitioners had not established that the conspiracy charge was sufficiently related to the protection and promotion of Capital Video, though it refused to apply I.R.C. &#167; 6662 penalties. <i>Capital Video Corp. v.

Simply put, the petitioners presented no evidence that the criminal charge, the conspiracy to avoid paying Richichi's taxes (even ignoring the other charges), was sufficiently related to Capital Video. No one testified, for example, that the protection Richichi offered would not be provided had Guarino not helped to hide the tribute payments, or that such tax conspiracies are an integral part of tribute payments to organized crime networks. There was nothing in the record that required the tax court to make a finding that the conspiracy was related to the promotion of Capital Video's business. The burden of proof is on the taxpayer; had the petitioners introduced credible evidence on this point, the burden would have been shifted to the IRS, I.R.C. &#167; 7491(a), but no such evidence was introduced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners maintain that even though there was no direct evidence requiring a contrary conclusion, it was clear error for the tax court to refuse to make a \"common-sense inference\" that the tax conspiracy was a necessary part of the tribute payment scheme. They argue that the underlying payment of protection was an ordinary and necessary expense of Capital Video and that a crime necessarily carries with it a cover-up, and so the cover-up must also be an ordinary and necessary expense. There were more than adequate grounds to refuse to make such an inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> there was a fatal lack of evidence regarding the relationship between the tribute payments, the tax conspiracy, and Capital Video. While Capital Video may have benefitted from Richichi's protection, there was no evidence presented as to what services Richichi provided Capital Video. It is impossible to ascertain from the record whether Capital Video was a primary or even a significant beneficiary of the services, if any, exchanged for the tribute payments. Furthermore, no evidence was introduced that the effectiveness of the tribute payments depended on the resulting tax conspiracy. In light of these gaps in the evidence, the taxpayers did not show that the tribute payments were ordinary and necessary expenses of Capital Video. Even if the tax court did make an inference linking the tribute payments to the conspiracy charge, as the petitioners request, that inference itself would not result in a finding that the legal fees were deductible, because the tribute payments themselves are not clearly linked to the business of Capital Video. We cannot say the tax court committed clear error in rejecting the hypothesis that the tribute payments, as to Capital Video, necessitated the cover up which resulted in one of the criminal charges in the absence of evidence of this relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the tax court did not commit clear error by refusing to find that the payment of legal fees was an ordinary and necessary business expense by Capital Video. The deductions do not meet the second prong of the <i>Lohrke</i> test. Accordingly, we need not reach the question of the motive for the payments under <i>Lohrke</i>'s first prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Income to Guarino</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the tax court determined that the $423,101 in legal fees paid by Capital Video after it became a subchapter S corporation were not deductible, \"such adjustment mechanically results in additional income to Guarino in that same amount as a result of the corresponding increase in Guarino's share of the income of Capital Video, as an S corporation.\" <i>Capital Video,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">205654</span></span>, 2002 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 42, at *12. Subchapter S corporations do not retain profits or losses but instead pass them to their shareholders every year. <i>See</i> I.R.C. &#167; 1366(a). Once it is determined that the legal fees were not deductible business expenses, Capital Video's S corporation taxable income is increased by $423,101. Guarino, as the sole shareholder, must pay taxes on that amount as personal income. This result depends not on whether that money was spent for his benefit; instead, it flows directly from the pass-through nature of S corporation status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax court also concluded that the $93,936 in legal fees paid during calendar year 1996 while Capital Video was a subchapter C corporation should be construed as a constructive dividend to Guarino, and that he thus owed tax on that amount as well. <i>Capital Video,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">205654</span></span>, 2002 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 42, at *11-*12; <i>see Hadley v. Comm'r,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></span>, 545 (D.C.Cir.1929); <i>Hood v. Comm'r,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></span>, 180, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1206813</span></span> (2000); <i>Magnon v.

Guarino has not challenged this holding on appeal; he disputes the finding of a constructive dividend solely by arguing that the legal expenses were deductible by Capital Video. Because we find otherwise, that portion spent by Capital Video as a subchapter C corporation constitutes a constructive dividend and is therefore taxable to Guarino as ordinary income. I.R.C. &#167; 61(a)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Guarino argues that he should be able to deduct the legal expenses as miscellaneous itemized business expense deductions under I.R.C. &#167; 162(a). He claims that if the legal fees paid by Capital Video are to be taxable to him, then those legal fees should be considered to have been paid by him directly; moreover, he argues, once the legal fees are treated as his expense, he should be able to deduct them as a business expense. The tax court held that Guarino had not shown that the legal expenses were sufficiently related to a trade or business. <i>Capital Video,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">205654</span></span>, 2002 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 42, at *13. There was no clear error in this holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 162(a) permits deductions by individuals as well as by corporations for \"ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred ... in carrying on any trade or business.\" I.R.C. &#167; 162(a). Individuals may deduct legal expenses under &#167; 162(a) if they are sufficiently related to the taxpayer's business. <i>Tellier,</i> 383 U.S. at 689, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107198\"><a href=\"/opinion/107198/commissioner-v-tellier/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1118</span></a></span>. The appropriate test is whether the \"origin and character of the claim with respect to which an expense was incurred\" is business or personal. <i>Gilmore,</i> 372 U.S. at 49, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106528\"><a href=\"/opinion/106528/united-states-v-gilmore/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ultimately, however, Guarino did not show that the legal defense fees were ordinary and necessary business expenses, even considering the entirety of his business enterprises. The failings are similar to those set forth in the analysis of Capital Video's deduction. Guarino did not show a link between the protection of the businesses and the tax conspiracy in which he engaged; there was no evidence that the latter was an integral part of securing the former. Moreover, the indictment alleged, and the plea agreement acknowledged, conduct beyond merely hiding the tribute payments from the government. There was no clear error in the finding that the legal fees are not deductible by Guarino under &#167; 162(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the tax court against both Capital Video and Guarino is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Some facts are taken from Guarino's plea agreement.

See I.R.C. &#167;&#167; 1363(a), 1366(a). Thus, the validity of the deduction did not affect Capital Video's taxes once it elected S corporation status, but instead affected how much tax Guarino paid on the corporate disbursements</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In fact, the sales and resulting profits of Capital Video actually increased while Guarino was incarcerated</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> As background, we note that the indictments accused Guarino of four means of engaging in criminal misconduct, only one of which referenced or involved Capital Video in any way. The other three involved other pornography distribution enterprises and Guarino's Las Vegas show. The legal fees were paid to lawyers who were defending Guarino against all of these charges. The mere fact that Guarino pled guilty to only the conspiracy charge of the second superseding indictment, which described conduct linked to Capital Video as well as other conduct, does not transform the legal fees paid to resolve all of these criminal indictments into expenses deductible by Capital Video</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
