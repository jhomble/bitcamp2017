In  this  drug  appeal,\n                                \n\ndefendant Ever Miguel  Legarda challenges:  1)  trial rulings\n\nmade by the  district court which excluded  certain testimony\n\non  hearsay  grounds;  2)  the  court's  computation  of  the\n\nrelevant  amount of cocaine  for sentencing purposes;  and 3)\n\nthe court's upward departure from the Guidelines.  Finding no\n\nreversible error, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                   \n\n          In July of  1992, defendant traveled from  New York\n\nCity, where  he resided, to  his native country  of Colombia.\n\nUpon his return to New York, and apparently at the urging  of\n\nsomeone he had  met in Colombia, defendant  contacted Michael\n\nTeixera, known to defendant as Luis Rodrigues, and arranged a\n\nmeeting on a Manhattan street  corner.  In a subsequent phone\n\ncall by defendant to Teixera, the two arranged for Teixera to\n\nleave   an  automobile  for  defendant's  use  on  that  same\n\nManhattan  street corner  where the  two  had initially  met.\n\nDefendant also agreed with Teixera that defendant would drive\n\nthe car  to a restaurant in Astoria,  Queens, where he was to\n\nmeet a  man named Nunyo,  that he would thereafter  drive the\n\ncar to  Providence, Rhode Island,  and that he would  be paid\n\nseveral thousand dollars for doing so.\n\n          On August 20, 1992, adhering to the plan, defendant\n\npicked up  the car in  Manhattan, drove to the  restaurant in\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nQueens, and  met Nunyo, who placed a box  in the trunk of the\n\ncar.   The box contained  eleven kilograms of  cocaine, later\n\nfound  to be  88%  pure.   Rather  than  proceed directly  to\n\nProvidence,  defendant  drove  to  the  home  of  his  former\n\ngirlfriend  and his  two  sons where  he obtained  his former\n\ngirlfriend's permission to  travel to Providence in  her car,\n\nrather  than  in the  car  he  had  picked up  in  Manhattan.\n\nDefendant  drove to Providence  accompanied by his  two sons,\n\nboth under the age of thirteen, and one dog.\n\n          Upon  arriving in  Providence, defendant  again met\n\nTeixera,  who  was  a  government  informant.    Teixera  had\n\narranged  for a controlled  drug purchase in  which defendant\n\nwould  sell  cocaine  to   United  States  Drug   Enforcement\n\nAdministration (\"DEA\")  Task Force  Agent Lawrence  Lepore, a\n\ndetective  in the  Providence Police  Department.   Defendant\n\nfollowed Teixera to an apartment where Lepore was to make the\n\npurchase.   Defendant's two sons entered the apartment, along\n\nwith defendant.   After discussing  the price  of the  eleven\n\nkilograms  with Lepore,  as well  as  possible future  sales,\n\ndefendant delivered the  eleven kilograms to Lepore.   During\n\nthe consummation of the deal, defendant's two sons were  left\n\nin a separate room in the apartment.  DEA agents observed the\n\npurchase and arrested defendant.\n\n          After  his arrest, defendant  stated to Lepore that\n\nhe  had brought  his children  along in  order to  lessen the\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nlikelihood of being  stopped on his drive from  New York City\n\nto Providence.   He  also stated  that he  knew that the  box\n\ncontained drugs and that he was aware of larger quantities of\n\ndrugs  being  imported  from Colombia.    At  trial, however,\n\ndefendant  denied such knowledge.   He was  nonetheless found\n\nguilty of possession  with intent to distribute  a controlled\n\nsubstance  in  violation  of  21  U.S.C.     841  (a)(1)  and\n\n(b)(1)(A)(ii).   \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          As noted  above, defendant offers  three challenges\n\non appeal.  We address them in turn.\n\nA.  The District Court's Hearsay Rulings\n                                        \n\n          At trial, defendant took the stand and attempted to\n\nrecount  statements  that  were  allegedly  made  to  him  by\n\nindividuals in Colombia, as well as statements made by Nunyo,\n\nhis  contact in  Astoria, Queens,  and by  Teixera.   In each\n\ncase, the  district court sustained  government objections on\n\nhearsay grounds.   See  Fed. R. Evid.  802.   Defense counsel\n                      \n\nrepeatedly explained  that defendant  was not offering  these\n\nstatements  in  order  to  prove  the  truth  of  the  matter\n\nasserted.  Rather,  he argued that the  significance of these\n\nalleged statements lay solely in the fact that they were made\n\nand   that  they  therefore  had  an  effect  on  defendant's\n\nbehavior.    See,   e.g.,  Fed.  R.  Evid.   801(c)  advisory\n                        \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ncommittee's  note   (\"If  the  significance  of   an  offered\n\nstatement lies solely in  the fact that it was made, no issue\n\nis  raised as  to the  truth  of anything  asserted, and  the\n\nstatement is not hearsay.\"); United States v. Hicks, 848 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 1988) (quoting same).\n\n          On  appeal,  the  government  concedes  that  these\n\nhearsay rulings were erroneous, and we agree  that the record\n\nclearly demonstrates  error on the  part of the  trial court.\n\nNonetheless, not all improper exclusions  of evidence require\n\nreversal.   Rather,  an appellant  must  show that  an  error\n\n\"results  in actual prejudice because it `had substantial and\n\ninjurious effect  or  influence  in  determining  the  jury's\n\nverdict.'\"  United  States v. Lane, 474 U.S.  438, 449 (1985)\n                                  \n\n(quoting  Kotteakos v.  United  States,  328  U.S.  750,  776\n                                      \n\n(1946)).  See also  28 U.S.C.   2111 (\"On the  hearing of any\n                  \n\nappeal . . . in any case, the court shall give judgment after\n\nan examination  of the  record without  regard  to errors  or\n\ndefects which do  not affect  the substantial  rights of  the\n\nparties.\");  Fed.  R.  Crim. P.  52(a)  (\"Any  error, defect,\n\nirregularity or  variance which  does not affect  substantial\n\nrights shall be disregarded.\").  Defendant fails to establish\n\nsuch harm. \n\n          Judging from the  contexts of the district  court's\n\nmultiple erroneous hearsay rulings, it appears that defendant\n\nin   each  instance   was   prepared  to   offer  exculpatory\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\ninformation about each of  the conversations, i.e., innocuous\n\nreasons offered  to him  by each  speaker which  would prompt\n\ndefendant  to perform  the acts which  eventually led  to his\n\narrest.    Later  in his  testimony,  however,  defendant was\n\nallowed  to  offer this  exculpatory  explanation of  events.\n\nDefendant testified that in  his conversations with  Teixera,\n\nNunyo and  others, he  was led to  believe that  the delivery\n\nconcerned either  \"spare parts\" or  cash.  Thus,  despite the\n\nerroneous  rulings,  defendant  was   eventually  allowed  to\n\nrecount  the essential elements of his own version of events.\n\nNotwithstanding   his  general   complaints  of   unfairness,\n\ndefendant does not  argue, nor could he on  the record before\n\nus, that these errors had  a substantial and injurious effect\n\nor influence on the jury's decision to convict him.    \n\n          In sum, defendant \"was allowed to put on a defense,\n\neven  if  not  quite  so  complete  a  defense  as  he  might\n\nreasonably have  desired.\"  United States v. Hanson, 994 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n403,  407 (7th  Cir. 1993).   The  substance of  the excluded\n\nportions   of  his  testimony  was  eventually  allowed  into\n\nevidence.  Given these errors and no more, we cannot say that\n\nreversal is warranted.\n\nB.  Sentencing\n              \n\n     1.  The Amount of  Cocaine and the District Court's Base\n                                                             \n     Offense Level Determination\n                                \n\n          The  sentencing court  determined defendant's  base\n\noffense  level  on  the  basis  of  twenty-one  kilograms  of\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\ncocaine; eleven  kilograms that were actually  delivered, and\n\nten more that  defendant purportedly promised to  deliver the\n\nfollowing  week.  Defendant  challenges the  district court's\n\ninclusion of the latter amount.\n\n          We  begin  by   noting  that  facts   supporting  a\n\nsentence,  such as  drug  quantity  determinations,  must  be\n\nproven by the government by a preponderance  of the evidence.\n\nSee United States v. Marino, 936 F.2d 23, 27 (1st Cir. 1991).\n                           \n\nFactual findings on such  issues are reviewed only  for clear\n\nerror.  Id.         Commentary  Note 12  to section  2D1.1 of\n           \n\nthe United States Sentencing Guidelines provides in  relevant\n\npart:\n\n               In an offense  involving negotiation\n          to traffic in a controlled substance, the\n          weight    under    negotiation    in   an\n          uncompleted distribution shall be used to\n          calculate    the    applicable    amount.\n          However, where  the court finds  that the\n          defendant did  not intend to  produce and\n          was not  reasonably capable  of producing\n          the  negotiated amount,  the court  shall\n          exclude  from  the  guideline calculation\n          the amount  that it  finds the  defendant\n          did  not intend  to produce  and was  not\n          reasonably capable of producing.  \n\nOur case  law has  followed the  language of  this Commentary\n\nNote  in a  rather faithful fashion,  requiring a  showing of\n\nboth  intent and  ability to  deliver in  order to  allow the\n\ninclusion  of negotiated amounts to be  delivered at a future\n\ntime.  See, e.g.,  United States v. Rotolo,  950 F.2d 70,  72\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Moreno, 947  F.2d 7, 9 (1st\n                                        \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nCir.  1991), United States  v. Estrada-Molina, 931  F.2d 964,\n                                             \n\n966 (1st Cir. 1991); United  States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601,\n                                              \n\n604 (1st Cir. 1991).   In this case, defendant challenges the\n\ndistrict court's findings that he had both the intent and the\n\nability to  produce  ten  additional  kilograms  of  cocaine.\n\nThough the case is close, we affirm.\n\n          At  trial, a tape recording of the drug transaction\n\nin Lepore's  apartment was  placed in  evidence.   The  taped\n\nconversation  spans the period of time during which defendant\n\npurportedly   negotiated  to   deliver  the   additional  ten\n\nkilograms.    Audible  portions  of  the  tape  reveal  vague\n\ncomments,   made  exclusively   by  Lepore  rather   than  by\n\ndefendant, about the possibility of  future deals.  Thus, the\n\ntape itself does not reveal  the existence of an agreement to\n\nprovide additional drugs.1\n\n                    \n\n1.  Compare,  e.g., United  States v. Cedano-Rojas,  999 F.2d\n                                                  \n1175,  1179 (7th  Cir.  1993)  (finding  that  defendant  had\nnegotiated purchase of nine  additional kilograms of  cocaine\nwhere  he stated,  \"`Save them,  save  them,' and  instructed\n[government  informant who was selling the drugs] `Don't give\nthem away.'\"); United States v. Williams, 994 F.2d 1287, 1293\n                                        \n(8th  Cir.  1993)  (finding  that  defendant  had  negotiated\nadditional sale where,  \"[o]nce the [government]  agent asked\nabout  the price of a quarter-pound [of cocaine], [defendant]\ndid offer to try to obtain and sell him this amount\"); United\n                                                             \nStates v. Mahoney, 972 F.2d 139, 143 (7th Cir. 1992) (finding\n                 \nthat defendant had negotiated additional sale where defendant\ndiscussed options for  delivery and payment, and  stated that\nhe  was  \"positive\"  that  his  supplier  could  deliver  the\nadditional amount); United States v. Cea, 963 F.2d 1027, 1031\n                                        \n(7th Cir.) (finding that defendant  had negotiated additional\npurchase  where evidence of \"very specific negotiations as to\nprice and  amount\" showed  that defendant  was \"dead  serious\nabout  buying and  distributing ten  kilograms of  cocaine\"),\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n          In addition to the  tape, however, Lepore testified\n\nat trial that during that  same meeting at which the delivery\n\ntook place, defendant had agreed to provide ten kilograms  on\n\na weekly basis.  Moreover, the inaudible portions of the tape\n\ndo not altogether rule out the possibility that  the specific\n\nagreement  described by Lepore  was made sometime  during the\n\ntransaction.  The  district court apparently chose  to credit\n\nLepore's testimony,  and we have no basis for concluding that\n\nit was clearly  erroneous in doing so.   Accordingly, we find\n\nno  error in the  district court's conclusion  that defendant\n\n                    \n\ncert.  denied,  113  S.  Ct. 281  (1992);  United  States  v.\n                                                         \nBurrell, 963 F.2d 976, 995 (7th Cir.)

I'll get\nyou the  other kilo.   And if you  want, even ten  more I can\nget.\"), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 151 (1991); United States v.\n                                                          \nFoley,  906 F.2d  1261, 1264  (8th  Cir. 1990)  (finding that\n     \ndefendant had not negotiated additional sale where government\n                 \nagent  had \"simply  inquired about  the  cost\" of  additional\nquantities of drugs).\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nfully  intended to  produce the  first  weekly instalment  of\n\ncocaine under the agreement which Lepore described.2\n\n          As  to  defendant's  ability  to  produce  the  ten\n                                      \n\nadditional kilograms, we find entirely plausible the district\n\ncourt's conclusion  that defendant,  having delivered  eleven\n\nkilograms of cocaine  one week, was capable of delivering ten\n\nkilograms the following week.  Accordingly, we  find no clear\n\nerror in the district court's drug quantity calculation.\n\n     2.  The Upward Departure\n                             \n\n          Finally,  defendant  appeals   a  two-level  upward\n\ndeparture to his sentence.  We review the departure along the\n\nlines set out in United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942,  950-\n                                        \n\n52 (1st Cir.  1993).  Plenary review is  applied to determine\n\nwhether the  allegedly special  circumstances underlying  the\n\ndeparture  are of  the kind  that the  Guidelines  permit the\n\nsentencing court to consider.  Id. at 951.  Plenary review is\n                                  \n\nalso applied to  interpretations of Guideline language.   Id.\n                                                             \n\nHowever,  we review the district court's determination that a\n\ncase is  unusual, and  therefore worthy  of departure,  \"with\n\n                    \n\n2.  Unlike  defendant, we are  not troubled by  the fact that\nthe district  court might  have sentenced  defendant on  more\n                                                             \nthan ten additional kilograms  based on the weekly nature  of\nthe  purported  deal,  and  we  express  no  opinion  on  the\npropriety  of  a  hypothetical  maximum  base  offense  level\nquantity determination based on these facts.  Rather,  on the\nbasis of  the  evidence before  it,  the district  court  was\nentitled to  find, and  it did in  fact find,  that defendant\nagreed to  deliver only  the first  weekly instalment  of ten\nkilograms.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nfull awareness of, and respect for, the trier's superior feel\n\nfor the case.\"  Id.  at 952 (citations and internal quotation\n                   \n\nmarks omitted).   Similarly deferential is our  review of the\n\nsentencing court's findings of fact, as well as the direction\n\nand degree of the departure.  Id.\n                                 \n\n          In  this  case,  the  district  court  offered  two\n\nreasons for its  upward departure:  1)  defendant's prominent\n\nrole  in cocaine  dealing as  evidenced both by  the quantity\n\ninvolved   and  its  purity;   and  2)  the   involvement  of\n\ndefendant's  minor children.  These grounds for departure are\n\nboth  permissible under the  Guidelines and warranted  on the\n\nrecord before us.\n\n          a.    Defendant's  Prominent Role  as  Evidenced by\n                                                             \n          Purity and Amount   \n                           \n\n          Defendant  argues that  the sentencing  court erred\n\nwhen, in deciding to depart upward, it relied upon the purity\n\nand amount of  the cocaine involved.   Consideration of  both\n\nfactors was allowable in this case.\n\n          Commentary  Note  9  of  U.S.S.G.     2D1.1  states\n\nspecifically  that \"[t]rafficking  in controlled  substances,\n\ncompounds, or mixtures  of unusually high purity  may warrant\n\nan upward  departure.\"  Note 9  goes on to state  that purity\n\n\"may  be  relevant in  the sentencing  process because  it is\n\nprobative of the defendant's role or position in the chain of\n                                                             \n\ndistribution.\"    Id.  (emphasis  supplied).    Thus,  upward\n                     \n\ndepartures which  are based on a defendant's  position in the\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nchain  of drug distribution  and which are  evidenced by drug\n\npurity  are   clearly  contemplated   under  the   sentencing\n\nguidelines.  Cf. United States v. Iguaran-Palmar, 926 F.2d 7,\n                                                \n\n9 (1st  Cir. 1991)  (stating that  \"the sentencing  court may\n\nconsider the drug's purity in making an upward departure from\n                                                        \n\nthe applicable guideline range\") (emphasis in original).\n\n          As  defendant points out, Note 9 also provides, \"As\n\nlarge quantities are normally  associated with high purities,\n\nthis factor is particularly relevant where smaller quantities\n                                    \n\nare  involved.\" (emphasis  supplied).    We  agree  with  the\n\nSeventh Circuit, however, that \"although the note states that\n\npurity   is  especially  relevant  in  the  case  of  smaller\n                       \n\nquantities  of  controlled  substances, it  does  not thereby\n\nrender  purity   irrelevant  where   larger  quantities   are\n\ninvolved.   Rather, the correct  reading of the note  is that\n\npurity   is  relevant  without  regard  to  the  quantity  of\n\ncontrolled substances, but is particularly relevant where the\n                                                   \n\nquantities involved are small.\"  United States v. Connor, 992\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1459, 1463 (7th Cir. 1993) (emphasis supplied).  In sum,\n\nthe district  court did  not err in  taking into  account the\n\npurity  of the  drugs  at  issue in  its  decision to  depart\n\nupward.\n\n          Equally futile  is defendant's insistence  that the\n\nsentencing court erred  in considering the amount  of cocaine\n\nat  issue in enhancing  defendant's guideline  range.   It is\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\ntrue, as  defendant argues,  that an  upward departure  based\n\nupon amount alone may unfairly duplicate a base offense level\n                 \n\ndetermination.  See, e.g., United States v. Fuller, 897  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1217, 1221-22 (1st Cir. 1990).   Here, however, the departure\n\nwas not  based  solely  upon  the amount  involved.    Rather\n\ndefendant's role in the drug distribution chain served as the\n\npartial basis  for the  departure, and  the amount  involved,\n\nmuch like the purity of the cocaine, was merely indicative of\n\ndefendant's  role.   Thus, we  find no  error in  the court's\n\nfinding  that  the amount  and  purity  of  the cocaine  were\n\nsignificant indicators  of defendant's prominent  role in the\n\ndrug distribution chain.\n\n          As to the factual findings of high purity and large\n\namounts of  cocaine, as well  as the  \"unusualness\" of  these\n\nfactors, see, e.g., Rivera, 994 F.2d at 952, we find no error\n                          \n\nin the district  court's determination that eleven  kilograms\n\nof 88%  pure cocaine serves,  in part, as  a valid  basis for\n\ndeparture. \n\n          b.  Involvement of Children\n                                     \n\n          Defendant also argues that the district court erred\n\nin  basing its  upward departure  in part  on the use  of his\n\nchildren in the offense.  Defendant essentially concedes that\n\nthe involvement of  children in drug trafficking  activity is\n\nan accepted ground  for upward departure and  challenges only\n\nthe  existence of  factual circumstances  in  this case  that\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nwarrant  a departure  on  that  basis.   He  argues that  the\n\ninvolvement of his own children is significantly less serious\n\nthan the  involvement of  children  in other  cases in  which\n\ndepartures were found warranted.  See, e.g., United States v.\n                                                          \n\nRodriguez-Cardona,  924 F.2d 1148, 1155 (1st Cir.)

Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July of 1992, defendant traveled from New York City, where he resided, to his native country of Colombia.  Upon his return to New York, and apparently at the urging of someone he had met in Colombia, defendant contacted Michael Teixera, known to defendant as Luis Rodrigues, and arranged a meeting on a Manhattan street corner.  In a subsequent phone call by defendant to Teixera, the two arranged for Teixera to leave an automobile for defendant's use on that same Manhattan street corner where the two had initially met.  Defendant also agreed with Teixera that defendant would drive the car to a restaurant in Astoria, Queens, where he was to meet a man named Nunyo, that he would thereafter drive the car to Providence, Rhode Island, and that he would be paid several thousand dollars for doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 20, 1992, adhering to the plan, defendant picked up the car in Manhattan, drove to the restaurant in Queens, and met Nunyo, who placed a box in the trunk of the car.  The box contained eleven kilograms of cocaine, later found to be 88% pure.  Rather than proceed directly to Providence, defendant drove to the home of his former girlfriend and his two sons where he obtained his former girlfriend's permission to travel to Providence in her car, rather than in the car he had picked up in Manhattan.  Defendant drove to Providence accompanied by his two sons, both under the age of thirteen, and one dog.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon arriving in Providence, defendant again met Teixera, who was a government informant.  Teixera had arranged for a controlled drug purchase in which defendant would sell cocaine to United States Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") Task Force Agent Lawrence Lepore, a detective in the Providence Police Department.  Defendant followed Teixera to an apartment where Lepore was to make the purchase.  Defendant's two sons entered the apartment, along with defendant.  After discussing the price of the eleven kilograms with Lepore, as well as possible future sales, defendant delivered the eleven kilograms to Lepore.  During the consummation of the deal, defendant's two sons were left in a separate room in the apartment.  DEA agents observed the purchase and arrested defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his arrest, defendant stated to Lepore that he had brought his children along in order to lessen the likelihood of being stopped on his drive from New York City to Providence.  He also stated that he knew that the box contained drugs and that he was aware of larger quantities of drugs being imported from Colombia.  At trial, however, defendant denied such knowledge.  He was nonetheless found guilty of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, defendant offers three challenges on appeal.  We address them in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The District Court's Hearsay Rulings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, defendant took the stand and attempted to recount statements that were allegedly made to him by individuals in Colombia, as well as statements made by Nunyo, his contact in Astoria, Queens, and by Teixera.  In each case, the district court sustained government objections on hearsay grounds.  See Fed.R.Evid. 802.  Defense counsel repeatedly explained that defendant was not offering these statements in order to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  Rather, he argued that the significance of these alleged statements lay solely in the fact that they were made and that they therefore had an effect on defendant's behavior.  See, e.g., Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) advisory committee's note (\"If the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made, no issue is raised as to the truth of anything asserted, and the statement is not hearsay.\");  United States v. Hicks, 848 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the government concedes that these hearsay rulings were erroneous, and we agree that the record clearly demonstrates error on the part of the trial court.  Nonetheless, not all improper exclusions of evidence require reversal.  Rather, an appellant must show that an error \"results in actual prejudice because it 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' \"  United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 449, 106 S.Ct. 725, 732, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1985) (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1253, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).  See also 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2111 (\"On the hearing of any appeal ... in any case, the court shall give judgment after an examination of the record without regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\");   Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (\"Any error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\").  Defendant fails to establish such harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judging from the contexts of the district court's multiple erroneous hearsay rulings, it appears that defendant in each instance was prepared to offer exculpatory information about each of the conversations, i.e., innocuous reasons offered to him by each speaker which would prompt defendant to perform the acts which eventually led to his arrest.  Later in his testimony, however, defendant was allowed to offer this exculpatory explanation of events.  Defendant testified that in his conversations with Teixera, Nunyo and others, he was led to believe that the delivery concerned either \"spare parts\" or cash.  Thus, despite the erroneous rulings, defendant was eventually allowed to recount the essential elements of his own version of events.  Notwithstanding his general complaints of unfairness, defendant does not argue, nor could he on the record before us, that these errors had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury's decision to convict him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, defendant \"was allowed to put on a defense, even if not quite so complete a defense as he might reasonably have desired.\"  United States v. Hanson, 994 F.2d 403, 407 (7th Cir.1993).  The substance of the excluded portions of his testimony was eventually allowed into evidence.  Given these errors and no more, we cannot say that reversal is warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

The Amount of Cocaine and the District Court's Base Offense Level Determination</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court determined defendant's base offense level on the basis of twenty-one kilograms of cocaine;  eleven kilograms that were actually delivered, and ten more that defendant purportedly promised to deliver the following week.  Defendant challenges the district court's inclusion of the latter amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that facts supporting a sentence, such as drug quantity determinations, must be proven by the government by a preponderance of the evidence.  See United States v. Marino, 936 F.2d 23, 27 (1st Cir.1991).  Factual findings on such issues are reviewed only for clear error.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Commentary Note 12 to section 2D1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an offense involving negotiation to traffic in a controlled substance, the weight under negotiation in an uncompleted distribution shall be used to calculate the applicable amount.  However, where the court finds that the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount, the court shall exclude from the guideline calculation the amount that it finds the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case law has followed the language of this Commentary Note in a rather faithful fashion, requiring a showing of both intent and ability to deliver in order to allow the inclusion of negotiated amounts to be delivered at a future time.  See, e.g., United States v. Rotolo, 950 F.2d 70, 72 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Moreno, 947 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1991), United States v. Estrada-Molina, 931 F.2d 964, 966 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 604 (1st Cir.1991).  In this case, defendant challenges the district court's findings that he had both the intent and the ability to produce ten additional kilograms of cocaine.  Though the case is close, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, a tape recording of the drug transaction in Lepore's apartment was placed in evidence.  The taped conversation spans the period of time during which defendant purportedly negotiated to deliver the additional ten kilograms.  Audible portions of the tape reveal vague comments, made exclusively by Lepore rather than by defendant, about the possibility of future deals.  Thus, the tape itself does not reveal the existence of an agreement to provide additional drugs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the tape, however, Lepore testified at trial that during that same meeting at which the delivery took place, defendant had agreed to provide ten kilograms on a weekly basis.  Moreover, the inaudible portions of the tape do not altogether rule out the possibility that the specific agreement described by Lepore was made sometime during the transaction.  The district court apparently chose to credit Lepore's testimony, and we have no basis for concluding that it was clearly erroneous in doing so.  Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's conclusion that defendant fully intended to produce the first weekly instalment of cocaine under the agreement which Lepore described.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to defendant's ability to produce the ten additional kilograms, we find entirely plausible the district court's conclusion that defendant, having delivered eleven kilograms of cocaine one week, was capable of delivering ten kilograms the following week.  Accordingly, we find no clear error in the district court's drug quantity calculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Upward Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendant appeals a two-level upward departure to his sentence.  We review the departure along the lines set out in United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 950-52 (1st Cir.1993).  Plenary review is applied to determine whether the allegedly special circumstances underlying the departure are of the kind that the Guidelines permit the sentencing court to consider.  Id. at 951.   Plenary review is also applied to interpretations of Guideline language.  Id.  However, we review the district court's determination that a case is unusual, and therefore worthy of departure, \"with full awareness of, and respect for, the trier's superior feel for the case.\"  Id. at 952 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  Similarly deferential is our review of the sentencing court's findings of fact, as well as the direction and degree of the departure.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court offered two reasons for its upward departure:  1) defendant's prominent role in cocaine dealing as evidenced both by the quantity involved and its purity;  and 2) the involvement of defendant's minor children.  These grounds for departure are both permissible under the Guidelines and warranted on the record before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Defendant's Prominent Role as Evidenced by Purity and Amount</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the sentencing court erred when, in deciding to depart upward, it relied upon the purity and amount of the cocaine involved.  Consideration of both factors was allowable in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Commentary Note 9 of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1 states specifically that \"[t]rafficking in controlled substances, compounds, or mixtures of unusually high purity may warrant an upward departure.\"   Note 9 goes on to state that purity \"may be relevant in the sentencing process because it is probative of the defendant's role or position in the chain of distribution.\"   Id. (emphasis supplied).  Thus, upward departures which are based on a defendant's position in the chain of drug distribution and which are evidenced by drug purity are clearly contemplated under the sentencing guidelines.  Cf. United States v. Iguaran-Palmar, 926 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1991) (stating that \"the sentencing court may consider the drug's purity in making an upward departure from the applicable guideline range\") (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As defendant points out, Note 9 also provides, \"As large quantities are normally associated with high purities, this factor is particularly relevant where smaller quantities are involved.\"  (emphasis supplied).  We agree with the Seventh Circuit, however, that \"although the note states that purity is especially relevant in the case of smaller quantities of controlled substances, it does not thereby render purity irrelevant where larger quantities are involved.  Rather, the correct reading of the note is that purity is relevant without regard to the quantity of controlled substances, but is particularly relevant where the quantities involved are small.\"  United States v. Connor, 992 F.2d 1459, 1463 (7th Cir.1993) (emphasis supplied).  In sum, the district court did not err in taking into account the purity of the drugs at issue in its decision to depart upward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally futile is defendant's insistence that the sentencing court erred in considering the amount of cocaine at issue in enhancing defendant's guideline range.  It is true, as defendant argues, that an upward departure based upon amount alone may unfairly duplicate a base offense level determination.  See, e.g., United States v. Fuller, 897 F.2d 1217, 1221-22 (1st Cir.1990).  Here, however, the departure was not based solely upon the amount involved.  Rather defendant's role in the drug distribution chain served as the partial basis for the departure, and the amount involved, much like the purity of the cocaine, was merely indicative of defendant's role.  Thus, we find no error in the court's finding that the amount and purity of the cocaine were significant indicators of defendant's prominent role in the drug distribution chain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the factual findings of high purity and large amounts of cocaine, as well as the \"unusualness\" of these factors, see, e.g., Rivera, 994 F.2d at 952, we find no error in the district court's determination that eleven kilograms of 88% pure cocaine serves, in part, as a valid basis for departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Involvement of Children</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also argues that the district court erred in basing its upward departure in part on the use of his children in the offense.  Defendant essentially concedes that the involvement of children in drug trafficking activity is an accepted ground for upward departure and challenges only the existence of factual circumstances in this case that warrant a departure on that basis.  He argues that the involvement of his own children is significantly less serious than the involvement of children in other cases in which departures were found warranted.  See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez-Cardona, 924 F.2d 1148, 1155 (1st Cir.)  (affirming upward departure where defendant had, inter alia, \"used a minor, a nine or ten year old boy, as a messenger in his drug business\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 54, 116 L.Ed.2d 31 (1991);  United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 50 (1st Cir.)  (affirming upward departure where defendant had, inter alia, used children to deliver drugs), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 862, 110 S.Ct. 177, 107 L.Ed.2d 133 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, we are asked to make a judgment \"about whether the given circumstances, as seen from the district court's unique vantage point, are usual or unusual, ordinary or not ordinary, and to what extent.\"  Rivera, 994 F.2d at 951.   Given the deferential standard of review dictated for such determinations by Rivera, id. at 951-52, and given 1) the well-known relation between drugs and violence;  2) defendant's own statement that he brought his children to avoid being stopped by the police;  and 3) the fact that the children were present in the apartment at the time of the drug deal, we find no error in the district court's determination that the presence of children was relevant to its decision to depart upward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. The Reasonableness of the Departure</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have noted previously in examinations of the reasonableness of departures, \" 'the district court's leeway is substantial.' \"  Rodriguez-Cardona, 924 F.2d at 1156 (quoting United States v. Aguilar-Pena, 887 F.2d 347, 350 (1st Cir.1989)).  In this case, given the various factors supporting upward departure, we find no error in the district court's two-level enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, defendant's conviction and his sentence are both</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Compare, e.g., United States v.

Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July of 1992, defendant traveled from New York City, where he resided, to his native country of Colombia.  Upon his return to New York, and apparently at the urging of someone he had met in Colombia, defendant contacted Michael Teixera, known to defendant as Luis Rodrigues, and arranged a meeting on a Manhattan street corner.  In a subsequent phone call by defendant to Teixera, the two arranged for Teixera to leave an automobile for defendant's use on that same Manhattan street corner where the two had initially met.  Defendant also agreed with Teixera that defendant would drive the car to a restaurant in Astoria, Queens, where he was to meet a man named Nunyo, that he would thereafter drive the car to Providence, Rhode Island, and that he would be paid several thousand dollars for doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 20, 1992, adhering to the plan, defendant picked up the car in Manhattan, drove to the restaurant in Queens, and met Nunyo, who placed a box in the trunk of the car.  The box contained eleven kilograms of cocaine, later found to be 88% pure.  Rather than proceed directly to Providence, defendant drove to the home of his former girlfriend and his two sons where he obtained his former girlfriend's permission to travel to Providence in her car, rather than in the car he had picked up in Manhattan.  Defendant drove to Providence accompanied by his two sons, both under the age of thirteen, and one dog.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon arriving in Providence, defendant again met Teixera, who was a government informant.  Teixera had arranged for a controlled drug purchase in which defendant would sell cocaine to United States Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") Task Force Agent Lawrence Lepore, a detective in the Providence Police Department.  Defendant followed Teixera to an apartment where Lepore was to make the purchase.  Defendant's two sons entered the apartment, along with defendant.  After discussing the price of the eleven kilograms with Lepore, as well as possible future sales, defendant delivered the eleven kilograms to Lepore.  During the consummation of the deal, defendant's two sons were left in a separate room in the apartment.  DEA agents observed the purchase and arrested defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his arrest, defendant stated to Lepore that he had brought his children along in order to lessen the likelihood of being stopped on his drive from New York City to Providence.  He also stated that he knew that the box contained drugs and that he was aware of larger quantities of drugs being imported from Colombia.  At trial, however, defendant denied such knowledge.  He was nonetheless found guilty of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, defendant offers three challenges on appeal.  We address them in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The District Court's Hearsay Rulings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, defendant took the stand and attempted to recount statements that were allegedly made to him by individuals in Colombia, as well as statements made by Nunyo, his contact in Astoria, Queens, and by Teixera.  In each case, the district court sustained government objections on hearsay grounds.  See Fed.R.Evid. 802.  Defense counsel repeatedly explained that defendant was not offering these statements in order to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  Rather, he argued that the significance of these alleged statements lay solely in the fact that they were made and that they therefore had an effect on defendant's behavior.  See, e.g., Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) advisory committee's note (\"If the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made, no issue is raised as to the truth of anything asserted, and the statement is not hearsay.\");  United States v. Hicks, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506664\"><a href=\"/opinion/506664/united-states-v-william-d-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the government concedes that these hearsay rulings were erroneous, and we agree that the record clearly demonstrates error on the part of the trial court.  Nonetheless, not all improper exclusions of evidence require reversal.  Rather, an appellant must show that an error \"results in actual prejudice because it 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' \"  United States v.

Sec. 2111 (\"On the hearing of any appeal ... in any case, the court shall give judgment after an examination of the record without regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\");   Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (\"Any error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\").  Defendant fails to establish such harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judging from the contexts of the district court's multiple erroneous hearsay rulings, it appears that defendant in each instance was prepared to offer exculpatory information about each of the conversations, i.e., innocuous reasons offered to him by each speaker which would prompt defendant to perform the acts which eventually led to his arrest.  Later in his testimony, however, defendant was allowed to offer this exculpatory explanation of events.  Defendant testified that in his conversations with Teixera, Nunyo and others, he was led to believe that the delivery concerned either \"spare parts\" or cash.  Thus, despite the erroneous rulings, defendant was eventually allowed to recount the essential elements of his own version of events.  Notwithstanding his general complaints of unfairness, defendant does not argue, nor could he on the record before us, that these errors had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury's decision to convict him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, defendant \"was allowed to put on a defense, even if not quite so complete a defense as he might reasonably have desired.\"  United States v.

See United States v. Marino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563220\"><a href=\"/opinion/563220/united-states-v-nicholas-r-marino-united-states-of-america-v-peter-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.1991).  Factual findings on such issues are reviewed only for clear error.

However, where the court finds that the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount, the court shall exclude from the guideline calculation the amount that it finds the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case law has followed the language of this Commentary Note in a rather faithful fashion, requiring a showing of both intent and ability to deliver in order to allow the inclusion of negotiated amounts to be delivered at a future time.  See, e.g., United States v. Rotolo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572660\"><a href=\"/opinion/572660/united-states-v-dominic-rotolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v.

In this case, defendant challenges the district court's findings that he had both the intent and the ability to produce ten additional kilograms of cocaine.  Though the case is close, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, a tape recording of the drug transaction in Lepore's apartment was placed in evidence.  The taped conversation spans the period of time during which defendant purportedly negotiated to deliver the additional ten kilograms.  Audible portions of the tape reveal vague comments, made exclusively by Lepore rather than by defendant, about the possibility of future deals.  Thus, the tape itself does not reveal the existence of an agreement to provide additional drugs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the tape, however, Lepore testified at trial that during that same meeting at which the delivery took place, defendant had agreed to provide ten kilograms on a weekly basis.  Moreover, the inaudible portions of the tape do not altogether rule out the possibility that the specific agreement described by Lepore was made sometime during the transaction.  The district court apparently chose to credit Lepore's testimony, and we have no basis for concluding that it was clearly erroneous in doing so.  Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's conclusion that defendant fully intended to produce the first weekly instalment of cocaine under the agreement which Lepore described.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to defendant's ability to produce the ten additional kilograms, we find entirely plausible the district court's conclusion that defendant, having delivered eleven kilograms of cocaine one week, was capable of delivering ten kilograms the following week.  Accordingly, we find no clear error in the district court's drug quantity calculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Upward Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendant appeals a two-level upward departure to his sentence.  We review the departure along the lines set out in United States v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608081\"><a href=\"/opinion/608081/united-states-v-mirna-rivera-united-states-v-robert-adamo/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>, 950-52 (1st Cir.1993).  Plenary review is applied to determine whether the allegedly special circumstances underlying the departure are of the kind that the Guidelines permit the sentencing court to consider.  Id. at 951.   Plenary review is also applied to interpretations of Guideline language.  Id.  However, we review the district court's determination that a case is unusual, and therefore worthy of departure, \"with full awareness of, and respect for, the trier's superior feel for the case.\"  Id. at 952 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  Similarly deferential is our review of the sentencing court's findings of fact, as well as the direction and degree of the departure.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court offered two reasons for its upward departure:  1) defendant's prominent role in cocaine dealing as evidenced both by the quantity involved and its purity;  and 2) the involvement of defendant's minor children.  These grounds for departure are both permissible under the Guidelines and warranted on the record before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Defendant's Prominent Role as Evidenced by Purity and Amount</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the sentencing court erred when, in deciding to depart upward, it relied upon the purity and amount of the cocaine involved.  Consideration of both factors was allowable in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Commentary Note 9 of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1 states specifically that \"[t]rafficking in controlled substances, compounds, or mixtures of unusually high purity may warrant an upward departure.\"   Note 9 goes on to state that purity \"may be relevant in the sentencing process because it is probative of the defendant's role or position in the chain of distribution.\"   Id. (emphasis supplied).  Thus, upward departures which are based on a defendant's position in the chain of drug distribution and which are evidenced by drug purity are clearly contemplated under the sentencing guidelines.  Cf. United States v. Iguaran-Palmar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556385\"><a href=\"/opinion/556385/united-states-v-john-iguaran-palmar/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1991) (stating that \"the sentencing court may consider the drug's purity in making an upward departure from the applicable guideline range\") (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As defendant points out, Note 9 also provides, \"As large quantities are normally associated with high purities, this factor is particularly relevant where smaller quantities are involved.\"  (emphasis supplied).  We agree with the Seventh Circuit, however, that \"although the note states that purity is especially relevant in the case of smaller quantities of controlled substances, it does not thereby render purity irrelevant where larger quantities are involved.  Rather, the correct reading of the note is that purity is relevant without regard to the quantity of controlled substances, but is particularly relevant where the quantities involved are small.\"  United States v. Connor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606345\"><a href=\"/opinion/606345/united-states-v-myles-j-connor-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1459</span></a></span>, 1463 (7th Cir.1993) (emphasis supplied).  In sum, the district court did not err in taking into account the purity of the drugs at issue in its decision to depart upward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally futile is defendant's insistence that the sentencing court erred in considering the amount of cocaine at issue in enhancing defendant's guideline range.  It is true, as defendant argues, that an upward departure based upon amount alone may unfairly duplicate a base offense level determination.  See, e.g., United States v. Fuller, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537727\"><a href=\"/opinion/537727/united-states-v-leonard-r-fuller/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1217</span></a></span>, 1221-22 (1st Cir.1990).  Here, however, the departure was not based solely upon the amount involved.  Rather defendant's role in the drug distribution chain served as the partial basis for the departure, and the amount involved, much like the purity of the cocaine, was merely indicative of defendant's role.  Thus, we find no error in the court's finding that the amount and purity of the cocaine were significant indicators of defendant's prominent role in the drug distribution chain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the factual findings of high purity and large amounts of cocaine, as well as the \"unusualness\" of these factors, see, e.g., Rivera, 994 F.2d at 952, we find no error in the district court's determination that eleven kilograms of 88% pure cocaine serves, in part, as a valid basis for departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Involvement of Children</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also argues that the district court erred in basing its upward departure in part on the use of his children in the offense.  Defendant essentially concedes that the involvement of children in drug trafficking activity is an accepted ground for upward departure and challenges only the existence of factual circumstances in this case that warrant a departure on that basis.  He argues that the involvement of his own children is significantly less serious than the involvement of children in other cases in which departures were found warranted.  See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez-Cardona, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555433\"><a href=\"/opinion/555433/united-states-v-osvaldo-rodriguez-cardona-aka-valdo/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span>, 1155 (1st Cir.)

Given the deferential standard of review dictated for such determinations by Rivera, id. at 951-52, and given 1) the well-known relation between drugs and violence;  2) defendant's own statement that he brought his children to avoid being stopped by the police;  and 3) the fact that the children were present in the apartment at the time of the drug deal, we find no error in the district court's determination that the presence of children was relevant to its decision to depart upward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c.
