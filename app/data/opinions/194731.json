Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\n                                                    \n\n                                        \n\n                            Before\n\n                     Breyer, Chief Judge,\n                                        \n              Torruella and Cyr, Circuit Judges.\n                                               \n\n                                        \n\n   Andrew A. Bucci on brief pro se.\n                  \n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n          Per Curiam.   The appellant, Andrew A. Bucci, is an\n                    \n\nattorney  in Rhode Island.   In 1976, Bucci  was convicted of\n\nmaking false declarations in a federal court, in violation of\n\n18  U.S.C.    1623(a),  and  of conspiracy  to  present false\n\ntestimony,  in violation of 18  U.S.C.   371.   Following the\n\nconviction, the  Rhode Island  Supreme Court  suspended Bucci\n\nfrom practice  in that  state's courts  for two years,  after\n\nwhich he would become eligible to apply for reinstatement.\n\n     Before Bucci became eligible for reinstatement, however,\n\nhe was convicted  of practicing law  without a license  (that\n\nis, while  under suspension), in violation  of R.I.Gen.Laws  \n\n11-27-10,  and   sentenced  to   a  six-month  prison   term.\n\nFollowing that conviction, in  1982, the Rhode Island Supreme\n\nCourt disbarred  Bucci.   Bucci was  reinstated to  the Rhode\n\nIsland bar in 1987.\n\n     During  the period  1977-1982,  the Local  Rules of  the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Rhode Island\n\nauthorized that  court to  take  disciplinary action  against\n\nattorneys who  were convicted  of crimes of  moral turpitude,\n\nbut  the Rules required  a hearing and  a vote  of the judges\n\nbefore sanctions could  be imposed.  The  district court took\n\nno  such  affirmative   disciplinary  action  against   Bucci\n\nfollowing either of  his convictions.  However,  in 1984, the\n\ndistrict court adopted Local Rule 4(e)(4), which provides:\n\n     An  attorney  who is  suspended  or disbarred  from\n     practice by the highest Court of the State in which\n\n                             -2-\n\n     he/she  practices .  .  . shall  be suspended  from\n     practicing before this Court. . . .\n\n     Both  the district court and  Bucci appear to accept the\n\nproposition that Rule 4(e)(4), upon its adoption, operated to\n\nautomatically suspend Bucci from practice before the district\n\ncourt  by  virtue of  his  previous disbarment  by  the state\n\ncourt.\n\n     In 1988, Bucci applied for readmission to the bar of the\n\ndistrict court.   He renewed  the application in  1990.   The\n\ndistrict court held a hearing, at which Bucci appeared before\n\nall three  active  judges.    The judges  then  decided  that\n\nBucci's \"petition for  readmission to the  bar of this  Court\n\nshould be denied because of the nature and seriousness of the\n\noffenses which  [he] committed.\"   The judges  expressed \"the\n\nopinion that any lawyer who has been convicted  of a crime of\n\ndishonesty should be permanently barred from practice in this\n\nCourt.\"    The  district  court denied  Bucci's  request  for\n\nreconsideration  and  entered  a judgment,  and  this  appeal\n\nfollowed.  We affirm.\n\n     Bucci  argues  that  the  Rhode  Island Supreme  Court's\n\ndecision to reinstate him in 1987 required the district court\n\nto follow suit.  We disagree.   Local Rule 4(e)(4) does  not,\n\nby its terms,  create a door that must swing  both ways.  The\n\nrule allowed the  district court to  follow the Rhode  Island\n\nCourt's lead by disbarring  Bucci automatically following his\n\ndisbarment in the  state court,  but it did  not require  the\n\n                             -3-\n\ndistrict  court to  accept  as dispositive  the Rhode  Island\n\nCourt's  assessment  of  Bucci's  rehabilitation  and current\n\nfitness  to practice  law.   Rather, the  district court  was\n\nentitled  to  make  its own  judgment  in  that  regard --  a\n\njudgment that  we can  review only  for abuse  of discretion.\n\nSee  In  re Grievance  Committee  of  United States  District\n                                                             \n\nCourt, 847 F.2d 57, 61 (2d Cir. 1988); In re  Evans, 801 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n703, 706 (4th Cir. 1986); Standing Committee on Discipline v.\n                                                          \n\nRoss, 735 F.2d 1168, 1172 (9th Cir. 1984).  \n    \n\n     Given the  \"nature and seriousness\"  of Bucci's criminal\n\noffenses, we see no  abuse of discretion here.   The district\n\ncourt had  good reason to  doubt Bucci's character.   Bucci's\n\nfederal  crimes --  making  false declarations  in a  federal\n\ncourt, and  conspiring to  do so  -- were  felonies.   See 18\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.    371 (penalty for  conspiracy is not  more than five\n\nyears imprisonment); 18 U.S.C.    1623(a) (penalty for making\n\nfalse declarations is not more than five years imprisonment);\n\n18 U.S.C.    1(1) (any  offense punishable by  more than  one\n\nyear in prison  is a  felony).  Permanent  disbarment may  be\n\npremised upon a felony  conviction.  Ex Parte Wall,  107 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n265, 273  (1883); In re  Jones, 506 F.2d  527, 528 (8th  Cir.\n                              \n\n1974); In re Braverman, 148 F.Supp. 56, 57 (D.Md. 1957).\n                      \n\n     Bucci's state crime --  practicing law without a license\n\n-- was  a misdemeanor.   See R.I.Gen.Laws   11-27-14 (maximum\n                            \n\nprison term  of six  months);   11-1-2  (defining misdemeanor\n\n                             -4-\n\nand felony).  However, the crime was directly related to, and\n\nhighly probative of, his fitness to practice law honestly and\n\nethically.   See  Ex  Parte  Wall, 107  U.S.  at  273.   And,\n                                 \n\ndisbarment  is  an  appropriate  sanction for  a  lawyer  who\n\ncommits a misdemeanor \"which imports fraud or dishonesty.\"\n\n     The district  court obviated  any potential  due process\n\nconcerns by affording  Bucci a hearing before deciding not to\n\nreadmit him to its bar.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -5-\n",
