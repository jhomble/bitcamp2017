O'Leary.\n\n\n\n\n                        December 31, 2002\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.   This case began when John Dirrane,\n\na police officer in the Brookline Police Department, brought a\n\ncivil action to recover for alleged retaliation against him for\n\nreporting abuses in the police force, primarily within his own\n\nunit.   Certain of the individual defendants counterclaimed for\n\ndefamation.    The district court ultimately dismissed all claims--\n\nsome on a motion to dismiss and some on summary judgment--and both\n\nsides have appealed.\n\n            Dirrane joined the Brookline police force in 1980 and, in\n\n1986, joined the Identification Unit (\"ID Unit\") of the Detective\n\nDivision.     The ID Unit deals with photographs, fingerprints, and\n\nthe like.      Dirrane's immediate supervisor was Sergeant Thomas\n\nHeavey. In the early years, the head of the Detective Division was\n\nCaptain Hayes; Hayes was succeeded by Captain Thomas Keaveney. The\n\nChief of Police in Brookline was Howard Brackett until 1995 and\n\nthen Daniel O'Leary.\n\n            According to Dirrane, work increased in the ID Unit\n\nbeginning in the early 1990s and thereafter Heavey and the other\n\nofficer in the unit engaged in a continuing array of abuses.\n\nDirrane complained repeatedly to Heavey and, when rebuffed, took\n\nhis complaints on a number of occasions to Keaveney, Hayes, and\n\nO'Leary.    Dirrane's complaints ranged from minor to quite serious.\n\nHis initial complaints, which started in 1992, were relatively\n\nminor; he claimed that certain officers were playing cards during\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fwork hours, that his supervisors had improperly waived firearm\n\nlicensing requirements, and that the accounting safeguards in his\n\nunit were inadequate.     He then started to make more serious\n\nallegations charging Heavey and the other officer in the unit with\n\nfalsifying fingerprint reports and destroying fingerprint evidence.\n\nHe alleged that Heavey instructed him to falsify reports as well.\n\nHe also continued to make less serious complaints, objecting to the\n\nmanner in which evidence was stored and logged in the unit.\n\n          In Dirrane's view, these senior figures promised to look\n\ninto matters but did very little.    By contrast, according to the\n\ndefense, Keaveney and O'Leary (Hayes is not a defendant and his\n\nrole can be ignored) concluded that much of what Dirrane was\n\nalleging was wrong or could not be substantiated, that Dirrane was\n\na continuing cause of friction and disruption, that he needed to\n\ntalk with a department psychologist, and (ultimately) that he ought\n\nto work somewhere else in the department.\n\n          In March or April 1997, Keaveney changed Dirrane's work\n\nhours from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. to a more normal schedule (8 a.m. to 4\n\np.m.) but one that Dirrane said conflicted with his wife's schedule\n\nand their need to care for their child.   Under some stress, Dirrane\n\nthen asked for a transfer to the Patrol Division or to another\n\ndetective unit.   On April 17, Internal Affairs officers asked\n\nDirrane for his office keys and his firearm, and on April 18,\n\nO'Leary and Keaveney told Dirrane that he was moving to the Patrol\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fDivision.        Because of the stress, he was given ten-days leave\n\nbefore reporting.\n\n               During the next several months Dirrane received some\n\npsychological counseling while serving in the Patrol Division, and\n\nhis firearm was returned to him about a year later.                  Dirrane\n\ncontinued to earn his ordinary police-officer income but claims to\n\nhave suffered severe and permanent emotional trauma as a result of\n\nhis overall experience.         On April 7, 1999, just short of two years\n\nafter his transfer, Dirrane brought the present action in state\n\ncourt.\n\n               In relevant part, Dirrane's complaint alleged a violation\n\nof the Massachusetts whistleblower statute (count II), Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 149, § 185 (2000), and a violation of his First Amendment\n\nrights subject to redress under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000) (count\n\nIII).1        The   pertinent   remaining   defendants   are   the   Town   of\n\nBrookline, Chief O'Leary and Captain Keaveney.           Although Sergeant\n\nHeavey was also named, he did not cause the alleged retaliation\n\ncomplained of and on appeal Dirrane makes no effort to implicate\n\nhim.       The individual defendants counterclaimed against Dirrane for\n\ndefamation based on statements Dirrane made to the press about the\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      Count I set forth a comparable civil rights claim under state\nlaw and count IV claimed a civil conspiracy under state law.\nDirrane does not distinguish between counts I and III; and he has\nnot appealed from the district court's later dismissal of count IV\nfor failure to state a claim.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fmatter.     The defense removed the case to federal district court\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441 (2000).\n\n            After    removal   to   federal   court   and   discovery,   the\n\ndistrict court in two successive orders dismissed all claims on\n\nboth sides.      The section 1983 damage claims against the individual\n\nofficers were dismissed on qualified immunity grounds.           As to the\n\ntown, the court found no evidence whatsoever of any policy or\n\ncustom that could warrant municipal liability under the Monell\n\ndoctrine.     Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658 (1978).\n\nThe court also declined to order injunctive relief against the town\n\nor Chief O'Leary.\n\n            The district court dismissed the state whistleblower\n\nclaim because concededly Dirrane had not provided the \"written\n\nnotice\" that the court found to be required by the statute.              The\n\ncourt also said, in the alternative, that neither the state nor the\n\nfederal claims could succeed because Dirrane had himself requested\n\nthe transfer.       Finally, the court dismissed the counterclaims for\n\ndefamation on the ground that the \"malice\" requirement could not be\n\nmet.   See N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279-80 (1964).\n\nCross-appeals followed.\n\n            1.    We begin with Dirrane's attack on the dismissal of\n\nhis First Amendment claims for damages against the individual\n\nofficers. As to these claims, the district court assumed the truth\n\nof the allegations in the complaint; but it concluded that Dirrane\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcould identify no doctrine or precedent \"clearly\" establishing that\n\nthe defendants' conduct under the circumstances alleged violated\n\nhis constitutional rights.   Accordingly, it held that the officers\n\nwere protected against damages claims by the doctrine of qualified\n\nimmunity.   Our review on this issue is de novo.   Carroll v. Xerox\n\nCorp., 294 F.2d 231, 237 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            Some First Amendment issues are governed by clear-cut\n\nrules, even though there may be close cases on the facts.     E.g.,\n\nBranti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 517 (1980) (political allegiance as\n\na permissible job qualification for policymakers). But for alleged\n\n\"disruptive speech\" by government whistleblowers, the Supreme Court\n\nhas adopted only a balancing test:     the whistleblower is entitled\n\nto protection against retaliation if his speech interests, along\n\nwith the public's interest in hearing the speech, outweigh the\n\ngovernment's need to limit distractions, conserve resources, and\n\nmaintain esprit in the workplace.     Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391\n\nU.S. 563, 568 (1968); Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 150-51\n\n(1983); Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378, 388 (1987).\n\n            This uncertain standard implicates the companion legal\n\ndoctrine of qualified immunity.   Under section 1983, a government\n\nemployee is immune to damages where a reasonable official could\n\nbelieve (the test is objective), albeit mistakenly, that his\n\nconduct did not violate the First Amendment. Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n\n457 U.S. 800, 818-19 (1982).      Immunity exists even where the\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fabstract \"right\" invoked by the plaintiff is well-established, so\n\nlong as the official could reasonably have believed \"on the facts\"\n\nthat no violation existed.       See Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office,\n\n298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir. 2002); Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 9-10\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           In a decision issued after the district court ruled, the\n\nSupreme Court has instructed us to start not with the immunity\n\nissue but with the question whether the facts as alleged make out\n\na violation of the First Amendment.        Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194,\n\n201 (2001).2    This makes sense where the issue is whether some\n\nabstract right exists; otherwise the \"rights\" issue may never be\n\nresolved. Id. But it is an uncomfortable exercise where, as here,\n\nthe   answer   whether   there   was   a   violation   may   depend   on   a\n\nkaleidoscope of facts not yet fully developed.           It may be that\n\nSaucier was not strictly intended to cover the latter case.\n\n           Nevertheless, assuming arguendo that Saucier applies, we\n\nagree with Dirrane that a colorable constitutional claim would be\n\nmade out if everything asserted by Dirrane in his very lengthy\n\ncomplaint were established as true and--perhaps more importantly--\n\n\n      2\n      On a motion to dismiss based on the complaint, the facts as\nalleged in the complaint control, with minor qualifications, e.g.,\nBeddall v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.\n1998) (court can consider undisputed documents alleged or\nreferenced in the complaint); but if the immunity issue is\npresented on a motion for summary judgment, facts not reasonably\ncontestable may be part of the landscape. See C.K. Smith & Co. v.\nMotiva Enters. LLC, 269 F.3d 70, 73 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fdefendants had no other facts with which to justify their actions.\n\nIt is difficult to be more definitive because of a lack of case\n\nlaw; usually, the plaintiff is derailed before the court reaches\n\nthe merits question because the plaintiff was a policymaker who\n\ncould be fired or demoted because of his speech, or because pre-\n\nSaucier qualified immunity mooted the merits question.\n\n          In all events, the constitutional standard already set\n\nforth requires a balancing of the considerations on both sides.\n\nThose in Dirrane's favor are fairly easy to state.    Some of the\n\nconduct he charged is serious (such as destroying fingerprint\n\nevidence and falsifying reports) and allegedly continued over\n\nseveral years. He asserts that his supervisors listened to him but\n\ndid not make any serious effort to investigate his allegations and\n\nthat he was then transferred in retaliation for his complaints. In\n\nsum, the allegations have the structure of a classic cover-up in\n\nwhich the whistleblower suffered an adverse change in employment\n\n\"because\" of his speech on a public issue.\n\n          As one adds flesh to the bones, the situation becomes\n\nless clear-cut.   On the department's side, it had some basis for\n\ndistrusting Dirrane: he made one complaint after another on a wide\n\nrange of topics, some trivial, and others so serious as perhaps to\n\nbe difficult to credit.   Certainly, a responsible department head\n\nor chief would investigate (and Dirrane's allegation is that\n\nnothing much was done). Still, his superiors could have concluded,\n\n\n                               -9-\n\feven if mistakenly so, that they were dealing with someone who\n\nwould say anything to get attention and who would make up more\n\nserious     allegations    when      less   serious      ones      failed    to    draw\n\nattention.\n\n             Further, no action was taken against Dirrane simply for\n\nmaking complaints.         It     was   only    after    a    considerable        period\n\n(Dirrane's complaints began in 1992; he was not transferred until\n\n1997) that the department finally took action; by this time,\n\nDirrane's accusations had to have caused serious disruption in his\n\nthree-person unit, given that Dirrane had accused his supervisor\n\nand co-worker of a multitude of offenses over a long period.\n\nDirrane admitted this was so.           Even then, Dirrane was not demoted\n\nor fired; he was simply transferred to another unit, one that he\n\nhad raised as an alternative position.\n\n             Still, we conclude that Dirrane's version of facts makes\n\nout a colorable First Amendment violation.                    Whatever the doubts\n\nabout his judgment, Dirrane had made several extremely serious and\n\nspecific charges of criminal misconduct which (on his version of\n\nevents) the department did not seriously investigate.                         Had an\n\ninvestigation determined that the allegations were unfounded, the\n\ndisruption they generated would have amply justified the modest\n\nimpact of Dirrane's transfer upon his (and the public's interest\n\nin)   his    speech;   but      to    transfer    him        without   any   serious\n\ninvestigation     cannot     be      defended    under       the   Supreme    Court's\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fbalancing-of-interests test.      Cf. Roth v. Veteran's Admin., 856\n\nF.2d 1401, 1407-08 (9th Cir. 1988).\n\n          However, on qualified immunity, the outcome is different.\n\nThis is not the archetypal case of an employee who blows the\n\nwhistle on government misdeeds and is fired. The serious charges\n\nthat Dirrane made were nestled in a morass of complaints. The\n\ndepartment had some basis for distrusting Dirrane's judgment. The\n\ndepartment did not try to fire him; it just moved him to a position\n\neven he described as a second choice.            Here, as is common where\n\nthere is a lack of precedent,3 this is not a case in which a\n\nreasonable     officer   must   have     known     that   he   was   acting\n\nunconstitutionally.\n\n          2.    The district court also rejected Dirrane's claim for\n\ndamages against the town which, under Monell, cannot be based on\n\nrespondeat superior but requires independent liability based on an\n\nunconstitutional policy or custom of the municipality itself.           The\n\ndistrict court ruled that the town government, not the \"weak chief\"\n\nof the police department, see Chief of Police v. Town of Westford,\n\n313 N.E.2d 443, 445-46 (Mass. 1974), was the pertinent policymaker\n\nfor purposes of Monell and, on summary judgment, the court saw no\n\nevidence of a wrongful policy existing at the town level.\n\n\n\n     3\n      E.g., Frazier v. Bailey, 957 F.2d 920, 931 (1st Cir. 1992);\naccord Bartlett v. Fisher, 972 F.2d 911, 916 (8th Cir. 1992);\nRakovich v. Wade, 850 F.2d 1180, 1211-13 (7th Cir.) (en banc),\ncert. denied, 488 U.S. 968 (1988).\n\n                                  -11-\n\f                 On appeal, Dirrane argues that Monell does not bar a\n\nfederal claim for prospective injunctive relief (as opposed to\n\ndamages) against the town. However, the Supreme Court, in imposing\n\nthe    precondition        of   an     unconstitutional     \"official   municipal\n\npolicy,\"         was   directly      addressing   \"monetary,    declaratory,   or\n\ninjunctive relief.\"             Monell, 436 U.S. at 690 (emphasis added).\n\nThus, the Ninth Circuit's contrary position in Chaloux v. Killeen,\n\n886 F.2d 247, 250 (9th Cir. 1989), is on its face at odds with\n\nMonell itself.            Several other circuits have assumed that the\n\nChaloux interpretation is incorrect.4\n\n                 Dirrane also makes the more limited argument that Monell\n\ndoes       not    apply   where      the   plaintiff   is   seeking   prospective\n\ninjunctive relief against a local official rather than the town.\n\nThe wrinkle here is that Dirrane has insisted that he seeks\n\ninjunctive relief against the police chief in his official rather\n\nthan his personal capacity.                Monell says that a suit against an\n\nofficer in his official capacity is \"only another way of pleading\n\nan action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.\"\n\nMonell, 436 U.S. at 690 n.55; see also Will v. Mich. Dep't. of\n\n\n       4\n      Gernetzke v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1, 274 F.3d 464,\n468 (7th Cir. 2001) (\"The predominant though not unanimous view is\nthat Monell's holding applies regardless of the nature of the\nrelief sought.\"), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 1606 (2002); Bannum,\nInc. v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 901 F.2d 989 (11th Cir.\n1990)(applying Monell even though the plaintiff only sought\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief); see also Los Angeles Police\nProtective League v. Gates, 995 F.2d 1469, 1477-78 (9th Cir. 1993)\n(Fletcher, J., concurring).\n\n                                           -12-\n\fState Police, 491 U.S. 59, 71 (1989) (a suit against a state\n\nofficial in his official capacity \"is not a suit against the\n\nofficial but rather is a suit against the official's office\").\n\n           Yet in the sovereign immunity context, the Supreme Court\n\nhas repeatedly said that an official who acts unconstitutionally\n\ncan be enjoined even though the state is immune from damages. E.g.,\n\nEx Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159 (1908).         While one might at first\n\nsuppose that these were injunctions against the official in his\n\npersonal capacity (based on the fiction that unconstitutional\n\naction is not \"official\"), the Court has stated that the injunction\n\ncan be issued against the official in his official capacity.              In\n\nWill itself, 491 U.S. at 71 n.10 (1989), the Court said that \"of\n\ncourse a state official in his or her official capacity, when sued\n\nfor injunctive relief, would be a person under § 1983 because\n\nofficial-capacity actions for prospective relief are not treated as\n\nactions against the State.\"        Accord Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S.\n\n159, 167 n. 14 (1985).\n\n           Where the injunction does not implicate direct payments,\n\nthe difference between personal and official capacity is largely in\n\nthe details, (e.g., whether the injunction runs against a successor\n\nin   office),   and   none   of   the   Court's   seemingly     inconsistent\n\nlocutions occurs in a case where it matters.           However the Supreme\n\nCourt   eventually    resolves    the   tension   in   its   pronouncements,\n\nequitable relief would not be appropriate here.                 In his new\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fposition, Dirrane does not plausibly claim to be threatened with\n\nretaliation.   And reinstatement in the ID unit, not specifically\n\nrequested by Dirrane, would be a dubious remedy.          See, e.g.,\n\nVelazquez v. Figueroa-Gomez, 996 F.2d 425, 428-29 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied 510 U.S. 993 (1993); O'Donnell v. Yanchulis, 875 F.2d 1059,\n\n1062-63 (3rd Cir. 1989).\n\n          3. This brings us to Dirrane's claim for damages against\n\nthe town based on the state whistleblower law.       That statute,\n\nreprinted in pertinent part in an appendix to this opinion, is\n\ncomplicated and in certain respects unclear.   But neither side has\n\nasked for certification, and we have no intention of further\n\nprolonging this litigation.\n\n          The Massachusetts statute gives a civil claim for damages\n\nand equitable relief to an employee against a city or town (among\n\nother public entities) that engages in a \"retaliatory action\"\n\nagainst the employee \"because\" of defined protected conduct; this\n\nconduct includes the employee's disclosure \"to a supervisor or to\n\na public body\" of activities that the employee reasonably believes\n\nto constitute wrongdoing, a concept spelled out in generous terms.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 185(b). \"Retaliatory action\" is defined\n\nto include \"the discharge, suspension or demotion of an employee,\n\nor other adverse employment action taken against an employee in the\n\nterms and conditions of employment.\"   Id. § 185(a)(5).\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f           Certainly some of the disclosures made by Dirrane to his\n\nsuperiors concerned conduct, primarily that of Sergeant Heavey,\n\nwhich (if it occurred) would have comprised wrongdoing within the\n\nmeaning of the statute.        The district court gave two reasons for\n\ndismissing the statutory claim.           One is that Dirrane expressly\n\nrequested the transfer, the transfer being the primary conduct that\n\nmight constitute retaliation; the other is that Dirrane admittedly\n\ndid not give the written notice that the district court deemed the\n\nstatute to require.\n\n           Dirrane admits that he asked for the transfer but says\n\nthat he did so only because the new hours that had been fixed for\n\nhim in the ID Unit were impossible for him because of his child-\n\ncare duties.    He argues that these hours were set in an effort to\n\ncoerce him into transferring.      Whatever the reality, the record is\n\nsufficiently muddled on this issue to debar summary judgment.            It\n\nis enough to note that in discovery both O'Leary and Keaveney\n\nlinked   the   transfer   in    some   measure   to   Dirrane's   continued\n\ncomplaints.\n\n           The second ground is much more complicated. The statute\n\nmakes any civil claim by the employee contingent on giving the\n\nemployer \"written notice\" and \"a reasonable opportunity to correct\"\n\nthe wrongdoing before the employee reports the activity to a\n\n\"public body.\"     Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 185(c)(1).             \"Public\n\nbody,\"   as    defined,   includes     the   police    department.       Id.\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f§   185(a)(3).    Because     Dirrane    reported    the   conduct      to   his\n\nsupervisors in the police department but never gave written notice,\n\nthe district court--reading the statute literally--deemed Dirrane's\n\nclaim barred.\n\n           Although the point can be debated and no one has cited a\n\nMassachusetts case on point, we think this literal application of\n\nthe statute is at odds with its design and purpose.              Reading the\n\npertinent provisions in full (see the appendix), it is apparent\n\nthat an oral disclosure to a supervisor is protected outright\n\nagainst retaliation; the requirement of written notice and an\n\nopportunity to correct is imposed where the disclosure is to an\n\noutside public body.    Compare Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 185(a)(3)\n\nwith id. § 185(a)(4).\n\n           Patently,    the    purpose    was   to    give    the      employer\n\nunequivocal notice (i.e., in writing) and an opportunity to clean\n\nup its own house before the matter was taken outside.            But Dirrane\n\ndid not go outside before filing this lawsuit. His complaints were\n\nto superiors within the department.             It is happenstance, and\n\nirrelevant   to   the   obvious    purpose      of   the     written     notice\n\nrequirement, that the department itself happens to be a \"public\n\nbody\" to which employees of other agencies might bring complaints\n\nabout wrongdoing of their own employers.              In short, to treat\n\nDirrane's internal complaints as triggering the notice requirement\n\nmakes no sense.\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f           Alternatively, the town argues that the state court in\n\nwhich Dirrane filed his lawsuit was a public body and thus he was\n\nrequired to give written notice before filing suit.                         Under the\n\nliteral language of the statute, the town is correct; the statute\n\ndefines \"public bodies\" to include \"any federal, state, or local\n\njudiciary.\"       Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 185(a)(3).                      In this\n\napplication, a literal reading does make sense: the written notice\n\nrequirement      gives   the    employer      one   last    chance      to    correct\n\nwrongdoing before the employee goes public with his accusations.\n\n            Of course, on Dirrane's version of events, his oral\n\ncomplaints were repeated and comprehensive and a written notice\n\nwould likely have produced no different result.                  Nor is there any\n\nindication that written notice prior to suit would have resulted in\n\nthe    department    undoing     the   transfer.           But   the    statute    is\n\nunqualified in its requirement and in this instance a hard and fast\n\nrule    does     serve   a     rational    purpose,    namely,         by    avoiding\n\nuncertainties about what might have happened if formal notice had\n\nbeen given.      Thus, we agree that the state whistleblower claim is\n\nbarred.\n\n            4.    Little needs to be said about the defamation claims.\n\nThe counterclaiming defendants admit that under New York Times Co.\n\nv. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279-80 (1964), they had to point to\n\nevidence from which a jury could infer that Dirrane made false\n\nstatements knowing them to be false or with reckless disregard for\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\ftheir truth.      The evidence to which defendants point in their\n\nbriefs to raise a factual issue is that some of the incidents\n\nalleged by Dirrane were not recorded in his day-book and that Chief\n\nO'Leary opined briefly in a deposition that he thought Dirrane knew\n\nsome of his statements were false.\n\n          These fragments amount to nothing.           Yes, Dirrane said\n\nthat he tried to record all his complaints; but obviously a few\n\nomissions, even coupled with one inconsistency between Dirrane's\n\nelaborate record and his detailed oral complaints, are not real\n\nproof of malice.    As for Captain O'Leary's unexplained conclusion\n\nthat   Dirrane    \"probably\"   did     not   believe   some   of   his    own\n\nallegations, it is not even admissible evidence of malice, being an\n\n\"opinion\" in no way helpful to the jury.         See Fed. R. Evid. 701.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.                Each\n\nside shall bear its own costs on this appeal.             Mass. Gen.

Certain of the individual defendants counterclaimed for defamation. The district court ultimately dismissed all claims &#8212; some on a motion to dismiss and some on summary judgment &#8212; and both sides have appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dirrane joined the Brookline police force in 1980 and, in 1986, joined the Identification Unit (\"ID Unit\") of the Detective Division. The ID Unit deals with photographs, fingerprints, and the like. Dirrane's immediate supervisor was Sergeant Thomas Heavey. In the early years, the head of the Detective Division was Captain Hayes; Hayes was succeeded by Captain Thomas Keaveney. The Chief of Police in Brookline was Howard Brackett until 1995 and then Daniel O'Leary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Dirrane, work increased in the ID Unit beginning in the early 1990s and thereafter Heavey and the other officer in the unit engaged in a continuing array of abuses. Dirrane complained repeatedly to Heavey and, when rebuffed, took his complaints on a number of occasions to Keaveney, Hayes, and O'Leary. Dirrane's complaints ranged from minor to quite serious. His initial complaints, which started in 1992, were relatively minor; he claimed that certain officers were playing cards during work hours, that his supervisors had improperly waived firearm licensing requirements, and that the accounting safeguards in his unit were inadequate. He then started to make more serious allegations charging Heavey and the other officer in the unit with falsifying fingerprint reports and destroying fingerprint evidence. He alleged that Heavey instructed him to falsify reports as well. He also continued to make less serious complaints, objecting to the manner in which evidence was stored and logged in the unit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Dirrane's view, these senior figures promised to look into matters but did very little. By contrast, according to the defense, Keaveney and O'Leary (Hayes is not a defendant and his role can be ignored) concluded that much of what Dirrane was alleging was wrong or could not be substantiated, that Dirrane was a continuing cause of friction and disruption, that he needed to talk with a department psychologist, and (ultimately) that he ought to work somewhere else in the department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March or April 1997, Keaveney changed Dirrane's work hours from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. to a more normal schedule (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.) but one that Dirrane said conflicted with his wife's schedule and their need to care for their child. Under some stress, Dirrane then asked for a transfer to the Patrol Division or to another detective unit. On April 17, Internal Affairs officers asked Dirrane for his office keys and his firearm, and on April 18, O'Leary and Keaveney told Dirrane that he was moving to the Patrol Division. Because of the stress, he was given ten-days leave before reporting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the next several months Dirrane received some psychological counseling while serving in the Patrol Division, and his firearm was returned to him about a year later. Dirrane continued to earn his ordinary police-officer income but claims to have suffered severe and permanent emotional trauma as a result of his overall experience. On April 7, 1999, just short of two years after his transfer, Dirrane brought the present action in state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In relevant part, Dirrane's complaint alleged a violation of the Massachusetts whistleblower statute (count II), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 185 (2000), and a violation of his First Amendment rights subject to redress under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000) (count III).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The pertinent remaining defendants are the Town of Brookline, Chief O'Leary and Captain Keaveney. Although Sergeant Heavey was also named, he did not cause the alleged retaliation complained of and on appeal Dirrane makes no effort to implicate him. The individual defendants counterclaimed against Dirrane for defamation based on statements Dirrane made to the press about the matter. The defense removed the case to federal district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After removal to federal court and discovery, the district court in two successive orders dismissed all claims on both sides. The section 1983 damage claims against the individual officers were dismissed on qualified immunity grounds. As to the town, the court found no evidence whatsoever of any policy or custom that could warrant municipal liability under the <i>Monell</i> doctrine. <i>Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,</i> 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). The court also declined to order injunctive relief against the town or Chief O'Leary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the state whistleblower claim because concededly Dirrane had not provided the \"written notice\" that the court found to be required by the statute. The court also said, in the alternative, that neither the state nor the federal claims could succeed because Dirrane had himself requested the transfer. Finally, the court dismissed the counterclaims for defamation on the ground that the \"malice\" requirement could not be met. <i>See N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan,</i> 376 U.S. 254, 279-80, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). Cross-appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. We begin with Dirrane's attack on the dismissal of his First Amendment claims for damages against the individual officers. As to these claims, the district court assumed the truth of the allegations in the complaint; but it concluded that Dirrane could identify no doctrine or precedent \"clearly\" establishing that the defendants' conduct under the circumstances alleged violated his constitutional rights. Accordingly, it held that the officers were protected against damages claims by the doctrine of qualified immunity. Our review on this issue is <i>de novo. Carroll v. Xerox Corp.,</i> 294 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir. 2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some First Amendment issues are governed by clear-cut rules, even though there may be close cases on the facts. <i>E.g., Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 517, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980) (political allegiance as a permissible job qualification for policymakers). But for alleged \"disruptive speech\" by government whistleblowers, the Supreme Court has adopted only a balancing test: the whistle-blower is entitled to protection against retaliation if his speech interests, along with the public's interest in hearing the speech, outweigh the government's need to limit distractions, conserve resources, and maintain esprit in the workplace. <i>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968); <i>Connick v. Myers,</i> 461 U.S. 138, 150-51, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983); <i>Rankin v. McPherson,</i> 483 U.S. 378, 388, 107 S.Ct. 2891, 97 L.Ed.2d 315 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This uncertain standard implicates the companion legal doctrine of qualified immunity. Under section 1983, a government employee is immune to damages where a reasonable official could believe (the test is objective), albeit mistakenly, that his conduct did not violate the First Amendment. <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 800, 818-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Immunity exists even where the abstract \"right\" invoked by the plaintiff is well-established, so long as the official could reasonably have believed \"on the facts\" that no violation existed. <i>See Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Swain v. Spinney,</i> 117 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a decision issued after the district court ruled, the Supreme Court has instructed us to start not with the immunity issue but with the question whether the facts <i>as alleged</i> make out a violation of the First Amendment. <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This makes sense where the issue is whether some abstract right exists; otherwise the \"rights\" issue may never be resolved. <i>Id.</i> But it is an uncomfortable exercise where, as here, the answer whether there was a violation may depend on a kaleidoscope of facts not yet fully developed. It may be that <i>Saucier</i> was not strictly intended to cover the latter case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, assuming <i>arguendo</i> that <i>Saucier</i> applies, we agree with Dirrane that a colorable constitutional claim would be made out if <i>everything</i> asserted by Dirrane in his very lengthy complaint were established as true and &#8212; perhaps more importantly &#8212; defendants had <i>no</i> other facts with which to justify their actions. It is difficult to be more definitive because of a lack of case law; usually, the plaintiff is derailed before the court reaches the merits question because the plaintiff was a policymaker who could be fired or demoted because of his speech, or because pre-<i>Saucier</i> qualified immunity mooted the merits question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the constitutional standard already set forth requires a balancing of the considerations on both sides. Those in Dirrane's favor are fairly easy to state. Some of the conduct he charged is serious (such as destroying fingerprint evidence and falsifying reports) and allegedly continued over several years. He asserts that his supervisors listened to him but did not make any serious effort to investigate his allegations and that he was then transferred in retaliation for his complaints. In sum, the allegations have the structure of a classic cover-up in which the whistleblower suffered an adverse change in employment \"because\" of his speech on a public issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As one adds flesh to the bones, the situation becomes less clear-cut. On the department's side, it had some basis for distrusting Dirrane: he made one complaint after another on a wide range of topics, some trivial, and others so serious as perhaps to be difficult to credit. Certainly, a responsible department head or chief would investigate (and Dirrane's allegation is that nothing much was done). Still, his superiors could have concluded, even if mistakenly so, that they were dealing with someone who would say anything to get attention and who would make up more serious allegations when less serious ones failed to draw attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, no action was taken against Dirrane simply for making complaints. It was only after a considerable period (Dirrane's complaints began in 1992; he was not transferred until 1997) that the department finally took action; by this time, Dirrane's accusations had to have caused serious disruption in his three-person unit, given that Dirrane had accused his supervisor and co-worker of a multitude of offenses over a long period. Dirrane admitted this was so. Even then, Dirrane was not demoted or fired; he was simply transferred to another unit, one that he had raised as an alternative position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, we conclude that Dirrane's version of facts makes out a colorable First Amendment violation. Whatever the doubts about his judgment, Dirrane had made several extremely serious and specific charges of criminal misconduct which (on his version of events) the department did not seriously investigate. Had an investigation determined that the allegations were unfounded, the disruption they generated would have amply justified the modest impact of Dirrane's transfer upon his (and the public's interest in) his speech; but to transfer him without any serious investigation cannot be defended under the Supreme Court's balancing-of-interests test. <i>Cf. Roth v. Veteran's Admin.,</i> 856 F.2d 1401, 1407-08 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, on qualified immunity, the outcome is different. This is not the archetypal case of an employee who blows the whistle on government misdeeds and is fired. The serious charges that Dirrane made were nestled in a morass of complaints. The department had some basis for distrusting Dirrane's judgment. The department did not try to fire him; it just moved him to a position even he described as a second choice. Here, as is common where there is a lack of precedent,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> this is not a case in which a reasonable officer <i>must</i> have known that he was acting unconstitutionally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The district court also rejected Dirrane's claim for damages against the town which, under <i>Monell,</i> cannot be based on respondeat superior but requires independent liability based on an unconstitutional policy or custom of the municipality itself. The district court ruled that the town government, not the \"weak chief\" of the police department, <i>see Chief of Police v. Town of Westford,</i> 365 Mass. 526, 313 N.E.2d 443, 445-46 (1974), was the pertinent policymaker for purposes of <i>Monell</i> and, on summary judgment, the court saw no evidence of a wrongful policy existing at the town level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Dirrane argues that <i>Monell</i> does not bar a federal claim for prospective <i>injunctive</i> relief (as opposed to damages) against the town. However, the Supreme Court, in imposing the precondition of an unconstitutional \"official municipal policy,\" was directly addressing \"monetary, declaratory, or <i>injunctive</i> relief.\" <i>Monell,</i> 436 U.S. at 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018 (emphasis added). Thus, the Ninth Circuit's contrary position in <i>Chaloux v. Killeen,</i> 886 F.2d 247, 250 (9th Cir.1989), is on its face at odds with <i>Monell</i> itself. Several other circuits have assumed that the <i>Chaloux</i> interpretation is incorrect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dirrane also makes the more limited argument that <i>Monell</i> does not apply where the plaintiff is seeking prospective injunctive relief against a local official rather than the town. The wrinkle here is that Dirrane has insisted that he seeks injunctive relief against the police chief in his <i>official</i> rather than his <i>personal</i> capacity. <i>Monell</i> says that a suit against an officer in his official capacity is \"only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.\" <i>Monell,</i> 436 U.S. at 690 n. 55, 98 S.Ct. 2018; <i>see also Will v. Mich. Dep't. of State Police,</i> 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (a suit against a state official in his official capacity \"is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the official's office\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet in the sovereign immunity context, the Supreme Court has repeatedly said that an official who acts unconstitutionally can be enjoined even though the state is immune from damages. <i>E.g., Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123, 159, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). While one might at first suppose that these were injunctions against the official in his personal capacity (based on the fiction that unconstitutional action is not \"official\"), the Court has stated that the injunction can be issued against the official in his official capacity. In <i>Will</i> itself, 491 U.S. at 71 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 2304 (1989), the Court said that \"of course a state official in his or her official capacity, when sued for injunctive relief, would be a person under &#167; 1983 because official-capacity actions for prospective relief are not treated as actions against the State.\" <i>Accord Kentucky v. Graham,</i> 473 U.S. 159, 167 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the injunction does not implicate direct payments, the difference between personal and official capacity is largely in the details, (<i>e.g.,</i> whether the injunction runs against a successor in office), and none of the Court's seemingly inconsistent locutions occurs in a case where it matters. However the Supreme Court eventually resolves the tension in its pronouncements, equitable relief would not be appropriate here. In his new position, Dirrane does not plausibly claim to be threatened with retaliation. And reinstatement in the ID unit, not specifically requested by Dirrane, would be a dubious remedy. <i>See, e.g., Velazquez v. Figueroa-Gomez,</i> 996 F.2d 425, 428-29 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i> 510 U.S. 993, 114 S.Ct. 553, 126 L.Ed.2d 454 (1993); <i>O'Donnell v. Yanchulis,</i> 875 F.2d 1059, 1062-63 (3rd Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. This brings us to Dirrane's claim for damages against the town based on the state whistleblower law. That statute, reprinted in pertinent part in an appendix to this opinion, is complicated and in certain respects unclear. But neither side has asked for certification, and we have no intention of further prolonging this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts statute gives a civil claim for damages and equitable relief to an employee against a city or town (among other public entities) that engages in a \"retaliatory action\" against the employee \"because\" of defined protected conduct; this conduct includes the employee's disclosure \"to a supervisor or to a public body\" of activities that the employee reasonably believes to constitute wrongdoing, a concept spelled out in generous terms. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 185(b). \"Retaliatory action\" is defined to include \"the discharge, suspension or demotion of an employee, or other adverse employment action taken against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 185(a)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly some of the disclosures made by Dirrane to his superiors concerned conduct, primarily that of Sergeant Heavey, which (if it occurred) would have comprised wrongdoing within the meaning of the statute. The district court gave two reasons for dismissing the statutory claim. One is that Dirrane expressly requested the transfer, the transfer being the primary conduct that might constitute retaliation; the other is that Dirrane admittedly did not give the written notice that the district court deemed the statute to require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dirrane admits that he asked for the transfer but says that he did so only because the new hours that had been fixed for him in the ID Unit were impossible for him because of his child-care duties. He argues that these hours were set in an effort to coerce him into transferring. Whatever the reality, the record is sufficiently muddled on this issue to debar summary judgment. It is enough to note that in discovery both O'Leary and Keaveney linked the transfer in some measure to Dirrane's continued complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second ground is much more complicated. The statute makes any civil claim by the employee contingent on giving the employer \"written notice\" and \"a reasonable opportunity to correct\" the wrongdoing before the employee reports the activity to a \"public body.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 185(c)(1). \"Public body,\" as defined, includes the police department. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 185(a)(3). Because Dirrane reported the conduct to his supervisors in the police department but never gave written notice, the district court &#8212; reading the statute literally &#8212; deemed Dirrane's claim barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the point can be debated and no one has cited a Massachusetts case on point, we think this literal application of the statute is at odds with its design and purpose. Reading the pertinent provisions in full (<i>see</i> the appendix), it is apparent that an <i>oral</i> disclosure to a supervisor is protected outright against retaliation; the requirement of written notice and an opportunity to correct is imposed where the disclosure is to an <i>outside</i> public body. <i>Compare</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 185(a)(3) <i>with</i> id. &#167; 185(a)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Patently, the purpose was to give the employer unequivocal notice (<i>i.e.,</i> in writing) and an opportunity to clean up its own house before the matter was taken outside. But Dirrane did not go outside before filing this lawsuit. His complaints were to superiors within the department. It is happenstance, and irrelevant to the obvious purpose of the written notice requirement, that the department itself happens to be a \"public body\" to which employees of <i>other</i> agencies might bring complaints about wrongdoing of their own employers. In short, to treat Dirrane's internal complaints as triggering the notice requirement makes no sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the town argues that the state court in which Dirrane filed his lawsuit was a public body and thus he was required to give written notice before filing suit. Under the literal language of the statute, the town is correct; the statute defines \"public bodies\" to include \"any federal, state, or local judiciary.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 185(a)(3). In this application, a literal reading does make sense: the written notice requirement gives the employer one last chance to correct wrongdoing before the employee goes public with his accusations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, on Dirrane's version of events, his oral complaints were repeated and comprehensive and a written notice would likely have produced no different result. Nor is there any indication that written notice prior to suit would have resulted in the department undoing the transfer. But the statute is unqualified in its requirement and in this instance a hard and fast rule does serve a rational purpose, namely, by avoiding uncertainties about what might have happened if formal notice had been given. Thus, we agree that the state whistleblower claim is barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Little needs to be said about the defamation claims. The counterclaiming defendants admit that under <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</i> 376 U.S. 254, 279-80, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), they had to point to evidence from which a jury could infer that Dirrane made false statements knowing them to be false or with reckless disregard for their truth. The evidence to which defendants point in their briefs to raise a factual issue is that some of the incidents alleged by Dirrane were not recorded in his day-book and that Chief O'Leary opined briefly in a deposition that he thought Dirrane knew some of his statements were false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These fragments amount to nothing. Yes, Dirrane said that he tried to record all his complaints; but obviously a few omissions, even coupled with one inconsistency between Dirrane's elaborate record and his detailed oral complaints, are not real proof of malice. As for Captain O'Leary's unexplained conclusion that Dirrane \"probably\" did not believe some of his own allegations, it is not even admissible evidence of malice, being an \"opinion\" in no way helpful to the jury. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 701.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i> Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.

The ID Unit deals with photographs, fingerprints, and the like. Dirrane's immediate supervisor was Sergeant Thomas Heavey. In the early years, the head of the Detective Division was Captain Hayes; Hayes was succeeded by Captain Thomas Keaveney. The Chief of Police in Brookline was Howard Brackett until 1995 and then Daniel O'Leary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Dirrane, work increased in the ID Unit beginning in the early 1990s and thereafter Heavey and the other officer in the unit engaged in a continuing array of abuses. Dirrane complained repeatedly to Heavey and, when rebuffed, took his complaints on a number of occasions to Keaveney, Hayes, and O'Leary. Dirrane's complaints ranged from minor to quite serious. His initial complaints, which started in 1992, were relatively minor; he claimed that certain officers were playing cards during work hours, that his supervisors had improperly waived firearm licensing requirements, and that the accounting safeguards in his unit were inadequate. He then started to make more serious allegations charging Heavey and the other officer in the unit with falsifying fingerprint reports and destroying fingerprint evidence. He alleged that Heavey instructed him to falsify reports as well. He also continued to make less serious complaints, objecting to the manner in which evidence was stored and logged in the unit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Dirrane's view, these senior figures promised to look into matters but did very little. By contrast, according to the defense, Keaveney and O'Leary (Hayes is not a defendant and his role can be ignored) concluded that much of what Dirrane was alleging was wrong or could not be substantiated, that Dirrane was a continuing cause of friction and disruption, that he needed to talk with a department psychologist, and (ultimately) that he ought to work somewhere else in the department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March or April 1997, Keaveney changed Dirrane's work hours from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. to a more normal schedule (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.) but one that Dirrane said conflicted with his wife's schedule and their need to care for their child. Under some stress, Dirrane then asked for a transfer to the Patrol Division or to another detective unit. On April 17, Internal Affairs officers asked Dirrane for his office keys and his firearm, and on April 18, O'Leary and Keaveney told Dirrane that he was moving to the Patrol Division. Because of the stress, he was given ten-days leave before reporting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the next several months Dirrane received some psychological counseling while serving in the Patrol Division, and his firearm was returned to him about a year later. Dirrane continued to earn his ordinary police-officer income but claims to have suffered severe and permanent emotional trauma as a result of his overall experience. On April 7, 1999, just short of two years after his transfer, Dirrane brought the present action in state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In relevant part, Dirrane's complaint alleged a violation of the Massachusetts whistleblower statute (count II), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 185 (2000), and a violation of his First Amendment rights subject to redress under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000) (count III).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The pertinent remaining defendants are the Town of Brookline, Chief O'Leary and Captain Keaveney. Although Sergeant Heavey was also named, he did not cause the alleged retaliation complained of and on appeal Dirrane makes no effort to implicate him. The individual defendants counterclaimed against Dirrane for defamation based on statements Dirrane made to the press about the matter. The defense removed the case to federal district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After removal to federal court and discovery, the district court in two successive orders dismissed all claims on both sides. The section 1983 damage claims against the individual officers were dismissed on qualified immunity grounds. As to the town, the court found no evidence whatsoever of any policy or custom that could warrant municipal liability under the <i>Monell</i> doctrine. <i>Monell v. Dep't of Soc.

The court also said, in the alternative, that neither the state nor the federal claims could succeed because Dirrane had himself requested the transfer. Finally, the court dismissed the counterclaims for defamation on the ground that the \"malice\" requirement could not be met. <i>See N.Y. Times Co. v.

We begin with Dirrane's attack on the dismissal of his First Amendment claims for damages against the individual officers. As to these claims, the district court assumed the truth of the allegations in the complaint; but it concluded that Dirrane could identify no doctrine or precedent \"clearly\" establishing that the defendants' conduct under the circumstances alleged violated his constitutional rights. Accordingly, it held that the officers were protected against damages claims by the doctrine of qualified immunity. Our review on this issue is <i>de novo. Carroll v.

But for alleged \"disruptive speech\" by government whistleblowers, the Supreme Court has adopted only a balancing test: the whistle-blower is entitled to protection against retaliation if his speech interests, along with the public's interest in hearing the speech, outweigh the government's need to limit distractions, conserve resources, and maintain esprit in the workplace. <i>Pickering v.

It may be that <i>Saucier</i> was not strictly intended to cover the latter case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, assuming <i>arguendo</i> that <i>Saucier</i> applies, we agree with Dirrane that a colorable constitutional claim would be made out if <i>everything</i> asserted by Dirrane in his very lengthy complaint were established as true and &#8212; perhaps more importantly &#8212; defendants had <i>no</i> other facts with which to justify their actions. It is difficult to be more definitive because of a lack of case law; usually, the plaintiff is derailed before the court reaches the merits question because the plaintiff was a policymaker who could be fired or demoted because of his speech, or because pre-<i>Saucier</i> qualified immunity mooted the merits question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the constitutional standard already set forth requires a balancing of the considerations on both sides. Those in Dirrane's favor are fairly easy to state. Some of the conduct he charged is serious (such as destroying fingerprint evidence and falsifying reports) and allegedly continued over several years. He asserts that his supervisors listened to him but did not make any serious effort to investigate his allegations and that he was then transferred in retaliation for his complaints. In sum, the allegations have the structure of a classic cover-up in which the whistleblower suffered an adverse change in employment \"because\" of his speech on a public issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As one adds flesh to the bones, the situation becomes less clear-cut. On the department's side, it had some basis for distrusting Dirrane: he made one complaint after another on a wide range of topics, some trivial, and others so serious as perhaps to be difficult to credit. Certainly, a responsible department head or chief would investigate (and Dirrane's allegation is that nothing much was done). Still, his superiors could have concluded, even if mistakenly so, that they were dealing with someone who would say anything to get attention and who would make up more serious allegations when less serious ones failed to draw attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, no action was taken against Dirrane simply for making complaints. It was only after a considerable period (Dirrane's complaints began in 1992; he was not transferred until 1997) that the department finally took action; by this time, Dirrane's accusations had to have caused serious disruption in his three-person unit, given that Dirrane had accused his supervisor and co-worker of a multitude of offenses over a long period. Dirrane admitted this was so. Even then, Dirrane was not demoted or fired; he was simply transferred to another unit, one that he had raised as an alternative position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, we conclude that Dirrane's version of facts makes out a colorable First Amendment violation. Whatever the doubts about his judgment, Dirrane had made several extremely serious and specific charges of criminal misconduct which (on his version of events) the department did not seriously investigate. Had an investigation determined that the allegations were unfounded, the disruption they generated would have amply justified the modest impact of Dirrane's transfer upon his (and the public's interest in) his speech; but to transfer him without any serious investigation cannot be defended under the Supreme Court's balancing-of-interests test. <i>Cf. Roth v. Veteran's Admin.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511715\"><a href=\"/opinion/511715/barry-h-roth-md-v-veterans-administration-of-the-government-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1401</span></a></span>, 1407-08 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, on qualified immunity, the outcome is different. This is not the archetypal case of an employee who blows the whistle on government misdeeds and is fired. The serious charges that Dirrane made were nestled in a morass of complaints. The department had some basis for distrusting Dirrane's judgment. The department did not try to fire him; it just moved him to a position even he described as a second choice. Here, as is common where there is a lack of precedent,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> this is not a case in which a reasonable officer <i>must</i> have known that he was acting unconstitutionally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The district court also rejected Dirrane's claim for damages against the town which, under <i>Monell,</i> cannot be based on respondeat superior but requires independent liability based on an unconstitutional policy or custom of the municipality itself. The district court ruled that the town government, not the \"weak chief\" of the police department, <i>see Chief of Police v. Town of Westford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1992797\"><a href=\"/opinion/1992797/chief-of-police-of-westford-v-westford/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1992797\"><a href=\"/opinion/1992797/chief-of-police-of-westford-v-westford/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 445-46 (1974), was the pertinent policymaker for purposes of <i>Monell</i> and, on summary judgment, the court saw no evidence of a wrongful policy existing at the town level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Dirrane argues that <i>Monell</i> does not bar a federal claim for prospective <i>injunctive</i> relief (as opposed to damages) against the town. However, the Supreme Court, in imposing the precondition of an unconstitutional \"official municipal policy,\" was directly addressing \"monetary, declaratory, or <i>injunctive</i> relief.\" <i>Monell,</i> 436 U.S. at 690, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The wrinkle here is that Dirrane has insisted that he seeks injunctive relief against the police chief in his <i>official</i> rather than his <i>personal</i> capacity. <i>Monell</i> says that a suit against an officer in his official capacity is \"only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.\" <i>Monell,</i> 436 U.S. at 690 n. 55, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However the Supreme Court eventually resolves the tension in its pronouncements, equitable relief would not be appropriate here. In his new position, Dirrane does not plausibly claim to be threatened with retaliation. And reinstatement in the ID unit, not specifically requested by Dirrane, would be a dubious remedy. <i>See, e.g., Velazquez v. Figueroa-Gomez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609730\"><a href=\"/opinion/609730/agapita-rosa-velazquez-v-edna-j-figueroa-gomez-two-cases-agapita-rosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span>, 428-29 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This brings us to Dirrane's claim for damages against the town based on the state whistleblower law. That statute, reprinted in pertinent part in an appendix to this opinion, is complicated and in certain respects unclear. But neither side has asked for certification, and we have no intention of further prolonging this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts statute gives a civil claim for damages and equitable relief to an employee against a city or town (among other public entities) that engages in a \"retaliatory action\" against the employee \"because\" of defined protected conduct; this conduct includes the employee's disclosure \"to a supervisor or to a public body\" of activities that the employee reasonably believes to constitute wrongdoing, a concept spelled out in generous terms. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 185(b). \"Retaliatory action\" is defined to include \"the discharge, suspension or demotion of an employee, or other adverse employment action taken against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 185(a)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly some of the disclosures made by Dirrane to his superiors concerned conduct, primarily that of Sergeant Heavey, which (if it occurred) would have comprised wrongdoing within the meaning of the statute. The district court gave two reasons for dismissing the statutory claim. One is that Dirrane expressly requested the transfer, the transfer being the primary conduct that might constitute retaliation; the other is that Dirrane admittedly did not give the written notice that the district court deemed the statute to require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dirrane admits that he asked for the transfer but says that he did so only because the new hours that had been fixed for him in the ID Unit were impossible for him because of his child-care duties. He argues that these hours were set in an effort to coerce him into transferring. Whatever the reality, the record is sufficiently muddled on this issue to debar summary judgment. It is enough to note that in discovery both O'Leary and Keaveney linked the transfer in some measure to Dirrane's continued complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second ground is much more complicated. The statute makes any civil claim by the employee contingent on giving the employer \"written notice\" and \"a reasonable opportunity to correct\" the wrongdoing before the employee reports the activity to a \"public body.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 185(c)(1). \"Public body,\" as defined, includes the police department. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 185(a)(3). Because Dirrane reported the conduct to his supervisors in the police department but never gave written notice, the district court &#8212; reading the statute literally &#8212; deemed Dirrane's claim barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the point can be debated and no one has cited a Massachusetts case on point, we think this literal application of the statute is at odds with its design and purpose. Reading the pertinent provisions in full (<i>see</i> the appendix), it is apparent that an <i>oral</i> disclosure to a supervisor is protected outright against retaliation; the requirement of written notice and an opportunity to correct is imposed where the disclosure is to an <i>outside</i> public body. <i>Compare</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 185(a)(3) <i>with</i> id. &#167; 185(a)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Patently, the purpose was to give the employer unequivocal notice (<i>i.e.,</i> in writing) and an opportunity to clean up its own house before the matter was taken outside. But Dirrane did not go outside before filing this lawsuit. His complaints were to superiors within the department. It is happenstance, and irrelevant to the obvious purpose of the written notice requirement, that the department itself happens to be a \"public body\" to which employees of <i>other</i> agencies might bring complaints about wrongdoing of their own employers. In short, to treat Dirrane's internal complaints as triggering the notice requirement makes no sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the town argues that the state court in which Dirrane filed his lawsuit was a public body and thus he was required to give written notice before filing suit. Under the literal language of the statute, the town is correct; the statute defines \"public bodies\" to include \"any federal, state, or local judiciary.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 185(a)(3). In this application, a literal reading does make sense: the written notice requirement gives the employer one last chance to correct wrongdoing before the employee goes public with his accusations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, on Dirrane's version of events, his oral complaints were repeated and comprehensive and a written notice would likely have produced no different result. Nor is there any indication that written notice prior to suit would have resulted in the department undoing the transfer. But the statute is unqualified in its requirement and in this instance a hard and fast rule does serve a rational purpose, namely, by avoiding uncertainties about what might have happened if formal notice had been given. Thus, we agree that the state whistleblower claim is barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Little needs to be said about the defamation claims. The counterclaiming defendants admit that under <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106761\"><a href=\"/opinion/106761/new-york-times-co-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 279-80, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106761\"><a href=\"/opinion/106761/new-york-times-co-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span> (1964), they had to point to evidence from which a jury could infer that Dirrane made false statements knowing them to be false or with reckless disregard for their truth. The evidence to which defendants point in their briefs to raise a factual issue is that some of the incidents alleged by Dirrane were not recorded in his day-book and that Chief O'Leary opined briefly in a deposition that he thought Dirrane knew some of his statements were false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These fragments amount to nothing. Yes, Dirrane said that he tried to record all his complaints; but obviously a few omissions, even coupled with one inconsistency between Dirrane's elaborate record and his detailed oral complaints, are not real proof of malice. As for Captain O'Leary's unexplained conclusion that Dirrane \"probably\" did not believe some of his own allegations, it is not even admissible evidence of malice, being an \"opinion\" in no way helpful to the jury. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 701.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i> Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.
