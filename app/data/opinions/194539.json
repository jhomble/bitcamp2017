This appeal is one branch  of a\n                          \n\ncomplex  commercial  matter  still  pending  in the  district\n\ncourt.  The case derives from a set of entangled transactions\n\nthat  have been  further complicated  by an  intervening bank\n\nfailure.    Perceiving reasons  for  a  prompt resolution  of\n\nclaims  against  one  party,  the district  court  entered  a\n\nseparate  final judgment as to  those claims, and this appeal\n\nfollowed.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     In the mid-1980's, the Fox Run  Realty Trust (\"Fox Run\")\n\nset  out  to  develop   a  residential  complex  in  Mashpee,\n\nMassachusetts, known as \"Willowbend.\"   In December 1986, the\n\nQuinaquisset  Realty Trust  (\"Quinaquisset\") conveyed  to Fox\n\nRun 152 acres of land adjoining the Fox Run holding, allowing\n\nthe  project  to  be  expanded.   In  exchange,  Quinaquisset\n\nreceived a large payment and the promise of a number of house\n\nlots  and   of  condominiums   or  permits  for   them  after\n\nsubdivision  approval.  Fox Run's obligations to Quinaquisset\n\nwere secured  by a first mortgage  on the 152 acres.   At the\n\nsame time, Sentry Federal  Savings Bank (\"Sentry\") loaned Fox\n\nRun $13  million to  finance Willowbend,  taking back  a note\n\nsecured by  a mortgage on Willowbend, subordinated  as to the\n\n152 acres.\n\n     In  October 1987,  Fox Run  conveyed to  Quinaquisset 20\n\nhouse lots and the rights to 22 or 23 condominium permits (we\n\n                             -2-\n\nare given different numbers in the briefs).  The Quinaquisset\n\nmortgage  on  the 152  acres was  discharged.   Fox  Run then\n\nrepurchased the permit rights for  cash and an unsecured $1.1\n\nmillion  note   to  Quinaquisset.    Then,   in  April  1989,\n\nQuinaquisset borrowed $950,000 from  Sentry, giving Sentry  a\n\nnote and  depositing with it  as collateral the  earlier $1.1\n\nnote  reflecting Fox  Run's debt  to Quinaquisset.    At this\n\npoint,  Fox Run was  indebted to  Quinaquisset and  both were\n\nindebted to Sentry.\n\n     In September 1989 Fox Run fell  into default on payments\n\nto Sentry, and Sentry  began to foreclose on Willowbend.   In\n\nApril  1990, Sentry  and Fox  Run entered  into a  settlement\n\nagreement; Fox Run  agreed to convey  title in Willowbend  to\n\nSentry  or  to  Evergreen Holding  Company  (\"Evergreen\"),  a\n\nwholly  owned subsidiary of Sentry, and  Sentry agreed not to\n\nclaim  under  the  note   against  two  individuals  who  had\n\nguaranteed  Fox Run's debt  to Sentry.   Sentry's mortgage on\n\nWillowbend,  however, was  not  discharged; rather  Evergreen\n\ntook the property subject to Sentry's  power to sell pursuant\n\nto the mortgage.\n\n     In the meantime, it  appears that Fox Run had  ceased in\n\nAugust 1989  to make  payments  to Quinaquisset  on the  $1.1\n\nmillion note  payable to Quinaquisset  but held by  Sentry as\n\ncollateral.   In November  1989, Quinaquisset fell  behind in\n\npayments on  its own $950,000 note  to Sentry.  In  May 1990,\n\n                             -3-\n\nQuinaquisset was in default,  and Sentry brought suit  on the\n\n$950,000 note in Middlesex  Superior Court, claiming not only\n\nagainst Quinaquisset's trustee, Daniel M. Driscoll, Jr.,  but\n\nalso against  a number of individuals who  had guaranteed the\n\nnote  (\"the  guarantors\").   For  simplicity,  we will  refer\n\ncollectively  to the  trustee and  guarantors, appellants  in\n\nthis court, as \"Quinaquisset.\"\n\n     Sentry  also  proceeded with  efforts  to  foreclose the\n\nWillowbend mortgage,  seeking to  sell both the  property and\n\nthe associated rights to the condominium permits that Fox Run\n\nhad transferred  to Quinaquisset  and then reacquired.   When\n\nQuinaquisset  threatened   to  delay  the  mortgage  sale  by\n\nlitigation, Sentry and Quinaquisset entered into an agreement\n\non  June 22, 1990.   That agreement (in  the first paragraph)\n\nreleased Sentry's  mortgage on  the 20 house  lots previously\n\nconveyed   to  Quinaquisset;  and  Quinaquisset,  subject  to\n\ncertain  reservations  of  rights  described  in  the margin,\n\nagreed  (in   the  second   paragraph)  not  to   enjoin  the\n\nforeclosure sale  \"or to  take any further  action subsequent\n\nthereto with reference to the validity of said foreclosure or\n\nthe  [m]ortgages relating  thereto.\"1   The foreclosure  sale\n\n                    \n\n     1This  promise was  qualified in  the same  paragraph by\nthis language: \"provided, however, that Quinaquisset reserves\nits  rights, claims  and remedies,  if any,  relating to  (i)\nSentry's   dealings  with  [the   two  individuals   who  had\nguaranteed  Fox  Run's note  to  Sentry],  and (ii)  Sentry's\ndealings with  Quinaquisset  regarding the  [m]ortgage  being\nreleased  . .  . .\"    In the  third  paragraph, the  parties\n\n                             -4-\n\nproceeded,  there  were multiple  bidders,  and  at the  sale\n\nEvergreen acquired Willowbend.\n\n     In  September 1990,  Sentry  failed and  the  Resolution\n\nTrust Company (\"RTC\") became its receiver.  The RTC created a\n\nnew  bank  entity; the  RTC  became  conservator of  the  new\n\nentity,  which  received   various  Sentry  assets  including\n\nEvergreen.  The RTC,  as receiver for Sentry, removed  to the\n\ndistrict  court  the litigation  in Middlesex  Superior Court\n\nbrought  by Sentry  against  Quinaquisset to  recover on  the\n\n$950,000 note.  \n\n                             II.\n\n     On May  22, 1991, Quinaquisset  filed a new  pleading in\n\nthe  district  court action,  including  for  the first  time\n\nEvergreen,   now   named   as  a   third   party   defendant.\n\nQuinaquisset's amended consolidated answer,  counterclaim and\n\nthird party complaint  is one of those documents that portend\n\na lot of litigation.  Claims were directed against the RTC as\n\nreceiver  for  Sentry  and  conservator of  the  new  entity,\n\nagainst Fox Run's trustees, and against Evergreen; there were\n\n12  counts,  alleging  multiple  wrongs  and  numerous  legal\n\ntheories; and the relief  sought included recision of various\n\ntransactions, imposition of constructive trusts, and damages.\n\n                    \n\nagreed,  \"with the  exception  of the  foregoing, to  reserve\nwithout prejudice  their rights,  claims or remedies\"  in the\nMiddlesex Superior Court action.\n\n                             -5-\n\n     As only the  claims against  Evergreen are  at issue  on\n\nthis appeal, we confine ourselves to the procedural steps and\n\nrulings  concerning  it.    Describing  the  claims   against\n\nEvergreen  is not  easy because  very little  in the  May 22,\n\n1991, pleading  relates directly to  it.  There  are specific\n\nallegations against others,  notably Sentry, including claims\n\nof misrepresentation  and trickery  in the  transactions that\n\nled  to  Quinaquisset's   discharge  of  its  mortgage,   the\n\nreconveyance  of  the  permit  rights to  Fox  Run,  Sentry's\n\nrefusal to fund interest  payments by Fox Run on  its debt to\n\nQuinaquisset, and  alleged attempts by Sentry  to cloud title\n\nto the  house lots  conveyed to  Quinaquisset.   The pleading\n\ndoes  claim that  Evergreen  holds  the  permit rights  in  a\n\nconstructive  trust  and  seeks   recision  of  the  original\n\ntransfer to Fox Run.\n\n     In June 1991, Evergreen filed a motion to dismiss or for\n\nsummary judgment.  On September 10, 1991,  the district court\n\ngranted summary  judgment for Evergreen on  the count seeking\n\nrecision,  concluding  that  the  recision  count  sought  to\n\nchallenge Evergreen's title to Willowbend; this, the district\n\ncourt found, was inconsistent with Quinaquisset's obligations\n\nunder  the agreement of June 22, 1990, quoted above, that had\n\npermitted the mortgage sale  to proceed.  On April  21, 1992,\n\nthe  court  granted summary  judgment  for  Evergreen on  the\n\nremaining  counts.  The court did not issue a written opinion\n\n                             -6-\n\nbut  it  appears  that  the  dismissal was  premised  on  the\n\nD'Oench, Duhme doctrine, which limits claims based on matters\n              \n\nnot reflected in  bank records.  See D'Oench, Duhme  &amp; Co. v.\n                                                         \n\nFDIC, 315 U.S. 447 (1942).2\n    \n\n     On May 12, 1992, the district court ordered the separate\n\nentry of  judgment  in  favor  of Evergreen  on  all  counts,\n\nfinding pursuant to  Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b)  that there was no\n\njust reason  for  delay.   We  pass over  related  procedural\n\nhistory and  note that the  reason for the  separate judgment\n\nstemmed from  an earlier determination by  the district court\n\nthat  the recision  claim against  Evergreen needed  a prompt\n\ndefinitive resolution  so that  Evergreen could complete  the\n\nsale   of  Willowbend   to  a   prospective  buyer.     Since\n\nQuinaquisset was  seeking immediate  appellate review  of the\n\nrecision claim,  the district court thought  it suitable that\n\nall  claims against Evergreen should  be before this court at\n\nthe same time.     Thus, the judgment  dismissing all  claims\n\nagainst Evergreen is properly  before us; the balance of  the\n\n                    \n\n     2The  district  court  relied   on  the  doctrine  in  a\nmemorandum  and  order of  July  19,  1991, granting  summary\njudgment  to  the  RTC  on all  counts  except  the  recision\nrequest;  that  request had  been dismissed  by the  court in\nearly May  1991 based on the agreement  of June 22, 1990.  In\nan order dated  May 12,  1992, the court  indicated that  the\nsame reasoning was implicated in Evergreen's case.\n\n                             -7-\n\nlitigation involving other  parties remains  in the  district\n\ncourt.3\n\n                    \n\n     3Quinaquisset contests the Rule 54(b)  certification but\nits  argument is unpersuasive.  The thread of the argument is\nthat to  enter a judgment  facilitating a sale  of Willowbend\ncould  impair  Quinaquisset's  prospects  of  recovering  the\npermit rights.  If so,  Quinaquisset was free to seek  a stay\nof judgment from  the district  court or from  us.  Absent  a\nshowing that would warrant a stay, the desire to facilitate a\nsale of assets, in connection with  a bank reorganization, is\na  perfectly good  ground for  the Rule  54(b) determination.\nSee generally  Curtiss-Wright Corp. v.  General Electric Co.,\n                                                           \n446 U.S. 1, 8 (1980).\n\n                             -8-\n\n                             III.\n\n     Like  the  district  court  we separate  the  claim  for\n\nrecision  against Evergreen  from the  balance of  the claims\n\nagainst  it.   Our reason  for doing  so is  that a  claim to\n\nrecover  property  is   the  one  line  of   attack  made  by\n\nQuinaquisset that we can imagine succeeding against Evergreen\n\nwithout a separate showing  of wrongful conduct by Evergreen.\n                                                            \n\nPutting to one side a possible D'Oench,  Duhme defense, there\n                                              \n\nmight  be  circumstances   in  which  Evergreen--without  any\n\nwrongdoing  on   its  part--became  a   holder  of   property\n\nwrongfully taken by  Sentry or others from Quinaquisset.   In\n\nthat case,  whether by  recision, constructive trust  or some\n\nother theory  or device, perhaps the property  could (in some\n\ncircumstances)  be reached  even though  in the  hands of  an\n\ninnocent possessor.\n\n     The district court foreclosed this possibility by ruling\n\non September  10,  1991, that  the June  22, 1990,  agreement\n\nbetween  the parties  prevented  such a  recovery.   Treating\n\nEvergreen's title  as derived from the  foreclosure sale, the\n\ndistrict  court interpreted  the  agreement  as preventing  a\n\nsubsequent  attack  on the  resulting  title  and ruled  that\n\n\"Evergreen owns the  property free of any title defect  . . .\n\n.\"  Quinaquisset asserts that the district court misconstrued\n\nthe agreement, ignoring the reservation of rights provisos.\n\n                             -9-\n\n     Subject  to the rights reservations, Quinaquisset agreed\n\nin  the June 22 document not to obstruct the foreclosure sale\n\n\"or  to  take  any  further action  subsequent  thereto  with\n\nreference  to  the  validity  of  said  foreclosures  or  the\n\n[m]ortgages  relating thereto . . . .\"  Evergreen argues that\n\n\"[t]he    clear meaning  of  the [agreement]  . .  .  is that\n\nQuinaquisset agrees not  to take any  action to challenge  or\n\nimpair the foreclosure purchaser's title in Willowbend.\"  The\n\nreservations  of  rights, it  argues,  were  meant to  retain\n\nQuinaquisset's damage claims, and  not its right to institute\n\na  future  action  affecting   title  to  Willowbend  or  the\n\nattendant permit rights.\n\n     We think this interpretation not quite so clear as  does\n\nEvergreen, the agreement being something less than a model of\n\nclarity.   There  is, after  all, no  express promise  not to\n\n\"challenge or  impair  the foreclosure  purchaser's title  in\n\nWillowbend.\"  But we agree that Evergreen's reading, endorsed\n\nby  the  district  court,  is  better  than  any  alternative\n\nreading, considering  the general language used (\"any further\n\naction  .  .  .  with  reference  to  the  validity  of  said\n\nforeclosures or  the [m]ortgages relating  thereto\") together\n\nwith the  purpose to protect the  foreclosure-sale buyer that\n\none  would expect in such circumstances.  If the \"any further\n\naction\"  promise is  read in  this way,  then  it is  easy to\n\n                             -10-\n\nconstrue  the  even  more  general  language  of  the  rights\n\nreservations to relate to other claims such as damages.\n\n     We might  be more hesitant  to reach this  conclusion if\n\nQuinaquisset had offered to us and the district court another\n\nreasonable reading of the \"any  further action\" clause, or if\n\nit  pointed to evidence produced or  promised in the district\n\ncourt  to show that the  parties intended the  clause to have\n\nsome other meaning.   But no other reading has  been tendered\n\nand  no   such  evidence   has  been  proffered.     Instead,\n\nQuinaquisset emphasizes the rights reservations which, as  we\n\nhave noted, are quite  general, ought not readily be  read to\n\ntake back  in the proviso  what Quinaquisset appears  to have\n\npromised immediately before, and  can easily be understood to\n\nrefer to other remedies such as damages.\n\n     Given  the  district  court's  interpretation  which  we\n\nsustain it becomes fruitless for Quinaquisset to argue, as it\n\ndoes  at  length, that  it might  otherwise  have a  claim to\n\nrecover  the permits  from Evergreen.   Assuming it  had such\n\nclaims,  whether by  recision or  constructive trust,  it has\n\nsurrendered them  by  the agreement.    This court  need  not\n\ndecide  Quinaquisset's alternative,  last ditch  and facially\n\ndoubtful argument that  Evergreen never acquired the  permits\n\nat all  (allegedly because  their acquisition  by Fox  Run in\n\nOctober  1987  was  \"illegal\");  the  claim  cut  off by  the\n\njudgment is  Quinaquisset's claim  to  recover property  from\n\n                             -11-\n\nEvergreen.    The judgment  does  not  address property  that\n\nEvergreen never received in the foreclosure.\n\n                             IV.\n\n     Turning now to  the remaining claims  against Evergreen,\n\nwe sustain their  dismissal on  a ground not  adopted by  the\n\ndistrict court.  See Doe v.  Anrig, 728 F.2d 30, 32 (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1984) (court \"free to affirm . . . on any ground supported by\n\nthe record\").    Both parties  treat  the district  court  as\n\nhaving  dismissed those  claims in  reliance on  the D'Oench,\n                                                             \n\nDuhme  doctrine, and we believe this is  so.  But there is no\n     \n\ndistrict  court opinion applying D'Oench, Duhme to Evergreen.\n                                               \n\nAlthough  the  district court  did  discuss  the doctrine  as\n\napplied  to  the  RTC,   Quinaquisset  seeks  to  distinguish\n\nEvergreen's status under  the doctrine.  We  think that there\n\nis  in  the  foreground  of  this  case  another   basis  for\n\nsustaining  the  dismissal--the  failure  to  state  a  claim\n\nagainst Evergreen--and we rest  our affirmance on that basis.\n\n     Evergreen is admittedly a  separate corporation and  was\n\napparently  not  a party  to  Fox  Run's  acquisition of  the\n\npermits or the  Fox Run-Sentry agreement.   The complaint may\n\nin  a literal  sense \"charge\" Evergreen  with wrongs  such as\n\nfraud, misappropriation, and unfair competition; but no facts\n\nare  ever alleged  that connect  Evergreen with  the wrongful\n\nacts  described.   The  complaint  does  nakedly assert  that\n\n                             -12-\n\nEvergreen is the \"alter ego\" of Sentry, the implication being\n\nthat it  is thereby  responsible for Sentry's  conduct.   Yet\n\nQuinaquisset  alleges no  facts that,  if proved,  would even\n\narguably permit a court to impose liability on Evergreen  for\n\nthe  acts of  its parent  under  an alter  ego  theory.   See\n                                                             \n\ngenerally  United Electrical,  Radio and  Machine Workers  of\n                                                             \n\nAmerica v.  163 Pleasant  Street Corporation, 960  F.2d 1080,\n                                            \n\n1092 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n     Similarly,  the  complaint  asserts  in  one  conclusory\n\nsentence  that Fox  Run's  obligations to  Quinaquisset  were\n\n\"assumed  by  Sentry   or  Evergreen\"  when   Willowbend  was\n\nacquired.  Nothing  else in the complaint  identifies any act\n\nor document reflecting such an assumption by Evergreen of Fox\n\nRun's debt  to Quinaquisset or remotely  suggests the factual\n\nbasis for this claim.  Factual allegations in a complaint are\n\nassumed  to be true when a court  is passing upon a motion to\n\ndismiss,  but  this  tolerance   does  not  extend  to  legal\n\nconclusions, Kadar Corp. v.  Milbury, 549 F.2d 230, 235  (1st\n                                    \n\nCir.  1977), or to \"bald  assertions.\"  Chongris  v. Board of\n                                                             \n\nAppeals of the Town of  Andover, 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st  Cir.),\n                               \n\ncert. denied 483 U.S. 1021 (1987).\n            \n\n     It  is, of  course, true  that at  the start  of complex\n\nlitigation  a party  may not  have all  the facts,  so courts\n\nnormally  hesitate to dismiss under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)\n\nat the outset.   At the start, a reasonable  basis for belief\n\n                             -13-\n\nand an outline of what one might reasonably hope to prove may\n\nsuffice to permit discovery and ward off premature motions to\n\ndismiss.   But Quinaquisset's complaint  against Evergreen is\n\ndeficient;   this  litigation  has persisted  for almost  two\n\nyears;  and yet  even  now Quinaquisset  is  still unable  to\n\nexplain  what  exactly  it  is  that  Evergreen  did that  is\n\nwrongful.  The only claims at issue on this appeal are  those\n\nrelating  to Evergreen.   No amount of  embellished attack on\n\nFox  Run, Sentry or the RTC can replace what Quinaquisset has\n\nstill not supplied: a single, coherent, specific  description\n\nof what Evergreen has done that is wrongful.\n\n     Our appraisal of Quinaquisset's claims against Evergreen\n\nis without prejudice to whatever claims it may assert against\n\nothers.   Part of its predicament  may be of its  own making:\n\nfor unexplained  reasons, it released  a mortgage on  part of\n\nWillowbend, reconveyed valuable permit rights to Fox Run, and\n\ntook back an unsecured note on which Fox Run later defaulted.\n\nOn  the other hand,  this misstep, if  such it was,  does not\n\npreclude  the   possibility  that   out  of  the   welter  of\n\nsurrounding events  a claim was created  against other active\n\nparticipants.  Whether this  is so, and if so  whether such a\n\nclaim is  nevertheless barred by D'Oench,  Duhme, are matters\n                                                \n\non which we have no occasion to pass at this time.\n\n     We conclude that, apart from seeking to recover property\n\nfrom Evergreen, Quinaquisset has failed to state a claim upon\n\n                             -14-\n\nwhich  relief can be granted.  The property recovery claim is\n\nbarred by the agreement for reasons already stated.  Thus the\n\nbalance of the claims fail under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and\n\non this ground  we affirm the  district court's dismissal  of\n\nthose  claims.  It will  be time enough  to consider D'Oench,\n                                                             \n\nDuhme  when  the rest  of  this  litigation, now  nine-tenths\n     \n\nsubmerged like the proverbial iceberg, reaches this court.\n\n     Affirmed. \n             \n\n                             -15-\n",

This appeal is one branch  of a\n                          \n\ncomplex  commercial  matter  still  pending  in the  district\n\ncourt.  The case derives from a set of entangled transactions\n\nthat  have been  further complicated  by an  intervening bank\n\nfailure.    Perceiving reasons  for  a  prompt resolution  of\n\nclaims  against  one  party,  the district  court  entered  a\n\nseparate  final judgment as to  those claims, and this appeal\n\nfollowed.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     In the mid-1980's, the Fox Run  Realty Trust (\"Fox Run\")\n\nset  out  to  develop   a  residential  complex  in  Mashpee,\n\nMassachusetts, known as \"Willowbend.\"   In December 1986, the\n\nQuinaquisset  Realty Trust  (\"Quinaquisset\") conveyed  to Fox\n\nRun 152 acres of land adjoining the Fox Run holding, allowing\n\nthe  project  to  be  expanded.   In  exchange,  Quinaquisset\n\nreceived a large payment and the promise of a number of house\n\nlots  and   of  condominiums   or  permits  for   them  after\n\nsubdivision  approval.  Fox Run's obligations to Quinaquisset\n\nwere secured  by a first mortgage  on the 152 acres.   At the\n\nsame time, Sentry Federal  Savings Bank (\"Sentry\") loaned Fox\n\nRun $13  million to  finance Willowbend,  taking back  a note\n\nsecured by  a mortgage on Willowbend, subordinated  as to the\n\n152 acres.\n\n     In  October 1987,  Fox Run  conveyed to  Quinaquisset 20\n\nhouse lots and the rights to 22 or 23 condominium permits (we\n\n                             -2-\n\nare given different numbers in the briefs).  The Quinaquisset\n\nmortgage  on  the 152  acres was  discharged.   Fox  Run then\n\nrepurchased the permit rights for  cash and an unsecured $1.1\n\nmillion  note   to  Quinaquisset.    Then,   in  April  1989,\n\nQuinaquisset borrowed $950,000 from  Sentry, giving Sentry  a\n\nnote and  depositing with it  as collateral the  earlier $1.1\n\nnote  reflecting Fox  Run's debt  to Quinaquisset.    At this\n\npoint,  Fox Run was  indebted to  Quinaquisset and  both were\n\nindebted to Sentry.\n\n     In September 1989 Fox Run fell  into default on payments\n\nto Sentry, and Sentry  began to foreclose on Willowbend.   In\n\nApril  1990, Sentry  and Fox  Run entered  into a  settlement\n\nagreement; Fox Run  agreed to convey  title in Willowbend  to\n\nSentry  or  to  Evergreen Holding  Company  (\"Evergreen\"),  a\n\nwholly  owned subsidiary of Sentry, and  Sentry agreed not to\n\nclaim  under  the  note   against  two  individuals  who  had\n\nguaranteed  Fox Run's debt  to Sentry.   Sentry's mortgage on\n\nWillowbend,  however, was  not  discharged; rather  Evergreen\n\ntook the property subject to Sentry's  power to sell pursuant\n\nto the mortgage.\n\n     In the meantime, it  appears that Fox Run had  ceased in\n\nAugust 1989  to make  payments  to Quinaquisset  on the  $1.1\n\nmillion note  payable to Quinaquisset  but held by  Sentry as\n\ncollateral.   In November  1989, Quinaquisset fell  behind in\n\npayments on  its own $950,000 note  to Sentry.  In  May 1990,\n\n                             -3-\n\nQuinaquisset was in default,  and Sentry brought suit  on the\n\n$950,000 note in Middlesex  Superior Court, claiming not only\n\nagainst Quinaquisset's trustee, Daniel M. Driscoll, Jr.,  but\n\nalso against  a number of individuals who  had guaranteed the\n\nnote  (\"the  guarantors\").   For  simplicity,  we will  refer\n\ncollectively  to the  trustee and  guarantors, appellants  in\n\nthis court, as \"Quinaquisset.\"\n\n     Sentry  also  proceeded with  efforts  to  foreclose the\n\nWillowbend mortgage,  seeking to  sell both the  property and\n\nthe associated rights to the condominium permits that Fox Run\n\nhad transferred  to Quinaquisset  and then reacquired.   When\n\nQuinaquisset  threatened   to  delay  the  mortgage  sale  by\n\nlitigation, Sentry and Quinaquisset entered into an agreement\n\non  June 22, 1990.   That agreement (in  the first paragraph)\n\nreleased Sentry's  mortgage on  the 20 house  lots previously\n\nconveyed   to  Quinaquisset;  and  Quinaquisset,  subject  to\n\ncertain  reservations  of  rights  described  in  the margin,\n\nagreed  (in   the  second   paragraph)  not  to   enjoin  the\n\nforeclosure sale  \"or to  take any further  action subsequent\n\nthereto with reference to the validity of said foreclosure or\n\nthe  [m]ortgages relating  thereto.\"1   The foreclosure  sale\n\n                    \n\n     1This  promise was  qualified in  the same  paragraph by\nthis language: \"provided, however, that Quinaquisset reserves\nits  rights, claims  and remedies,  if any,  relating to  (i)\nSentry's   dealings  with  [the   two  individuals   who  had\nguaranteed  Fox  Run's note  to  Sentry],  and (ii)  Sentry's\ndealings with  Quinaquisset  regarding the  [m]ortgage  being\nreleased  . .  . .\"    In the  third  paragraph, the  parties\n\n                             -4-\n\nproceeded,  there  were multiple  bidders,  and  at the  sale\n\nEvergreen acquired Willowbend.\n\n     In  September 1990,  Sentry  failed and  the  Resolution\n\nTrust Company (\"RTC\") became its receiver.  The RTC created a\n\nnew  bank  entity; the  RTC  became  conservator of  the  new\n\nentity,  which  received   various  Sentry  assets  including\n\nEvergreen.  The RTC,  as receiver for Sentry, removed  to the\n\ndistrict  court  the litigation  in Middlesex  Superior Court\n\nbrought  by Sentry  against  Quinaquisset to  recover on  the\n\n$950,000 note.  \n\n                             II.\n\n     On May  22, 1991, Quinaquisset  filed a new  pleading in\n\nthe  district  court action,  including  for  the first  time\n\nEvergreen,   now   named   as  a   third   party   defendant.\n\nQuinaquisset's amended consolidated answer,  counterclaim and\n\nthird party complaint  is one of those documents that portend\n\na lot of litigation.  Claims were directed against the RTC as\n\nreceiver  for  Sentry  and  conservator of  the  new  entity,\n\nagainst Fox Run's trustees, and against Evergreen; there were\n\n12  counts,  alleging  multiple  wrongs  and  numerous  legal\n\ntheories; and the relief  sought included recision of various\n\ntransactions, imposition of constructive trusts, and damages.\n\n                    \n\nagreed,  \"with the  exception  of the  foregoing, to  reserve\nwithout prejudice  their rights,  claims or remedies\"  in the\nMiddlesex Superior Court action.\n\n                             -5-\n\n     As only the  claims against  Evergreen are  at issue  on\n\nthis appeal, we confine ourselves to the procedural steps and\n\nrulings  concerning  it.    Describing  the  claims   against\n\nEvergreen  is not  easy because  very little  in the  May 22,\n\n1991, pleading  relates directly to  it.  There  are specific\n\nallegations against others,  notably Sentry, including claims\n\nof misrepresentation  and trickery  in the  transactions that\n\nled  to  Quinaquisset's   discharge  of  its  mortgage,   the\n\nreconveyance  of  the  permit  rights to  Fox  Run,  Sentry's\n\nrefusal to fund interest  payments by Fox Run on  its debt to\n\nQuinaquisset, and  alleged attempts by Sentry  to cloud title\n\nto the  house lots  conveyed to  Quinaquisset.   The pleading\n\ndoes  claim that  Evergreen  holds  the  permit rights  in  a\n\nconstructive  trust  and  seeks   recision  of  the  original\n\ntransfer to Fox Run.\n\n     In June 1991, Evergreen filed a motion to dismiss or for\n\nsummary judgment.  On September 10, 1991,  the district court\n\ngranted summary  judgment for Evergreen on  the count seeking\n\nrecision,  concluding  that  the  recision  count  sought  to\n\nchallenge Evergreen's title to Willowbend; this, the district\n\ncourt found, was inconsistent with Quinaquisset's obligations\n\nunder  the agreement of June 22, 1990, quoted above, that had\n\npermitted the mortgage sale  to proceed.  On April  21, 1992,\n\nthe  court  granted summary  judgment  for  Evergreen on  the\n\nremaining  counts.  The court did not issue a written opinion\n\n                             -6-\n\nbut  it  appears  that  the  dismissal was  premised  on  the\n\nD'Oench, Duhme doctrine, which limits claims based on matters\n              \n\nnot reflected in  bank records.  See D'Oench, Duhme  &amp; Co. v.\n                                                         \n\nFDIC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103624\"><a href=\"/opinion/103624/doench-duhme-co-v-fdic/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1942).2\n    \n\n     On May 12, 1992, the district court ordered the separate\n\nentry of  judgment  in  favor  of Evergreen  on  all  counts,\n\nfinding pursuant to  Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b)  that there was no\n\njust reason  for  delay.   We  pass over  related  procedural\n\nhistory and  note that the  reason for the  separate judgment\n\nstemmed from  an earlier determination by  the district court\n\nthat  the recision  claim against  Evergreen needed  a prompt\n\ndefinitive resolution  so that  Evergreen could complete  the\n\nsale   of  Willowbend   to  a   prospective  buyer.     Since\n\nQuinaquisset was  seeking immediate  appellate review  of the\n\nrecision claim,  the district court thought  it suitable that\n\nall  claims against Evergreen should  be before this court at\n\nthe same time.     Thus, the judgment  dismissing all  claims\n\nagainst Evergreen is properly  before us; the balance of  the\n\n                    \n\n     2The  district  court  relied   on  the  doctrine  in  a\nmemorandum  and  order of  July  19,  1991, granting  summary\njudgment  to  the  RTC  on all  counts  except  the  recision\nrequest;  that  request had  been dismissed  by the  court in\nearly May  1991 based on the agreement  of June 22, 1990.  In\nan order dated  May 12,  1992, the court  indicated that  the\nsame reasoning was implicated in Evergreen's case.\n\n                             -7-\n\nlitigation involving other  parties remains  in the  district\n\ncourt.3\n\n                    \n\n     3Quinaquisset contests the Rule 54(b)  certification but\nits  argument is unpersuasive.  The thread of the argument is\nthat to  enter a judgment  facilitating a sale  of Willowbend\ncould  impair  Quinaquisset's  prospects  of  recovering  the\npermit rights.  If so,  Quinaquisset was free to seek  a stay\nof judgment from  the district  court or from  us.  Absent  a\nshowing that would warrant a stay, the desire to facilitate a\nsale of assets, in connection with  a bank reorganization, is\na  perfectly good  ground for  the Rule  54(b) determination.\nSee generally  Curtiss-Wright Corp. v.  General Electric Co.,\n                                                           \n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110244\"><a href=\"/opinion/110244/curtiss-wright-corp-v-general-elec-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1980).\n\n                             -8-\n\n                             III.\n\n     Like  the  district  court  we separate  the  claim  for\n\nrecision  against Evergreen  from the  balance of  the claims\n\nagainst  it.   Our reason  for doing  so is  that a  claim to\n\nrecover  property  is   the  one  line  of   attack  made  by\n\nQuinaquisset that we can imagine succeeding against Evergreen\n\nwithout a separate showing  of wrongful conduct by Evergreen.\n                                                            \n\nPutting to one side a possible D'Oench,  Duhme defense, there\n                                              \n\nmight  be  circumstances   in  which  Evergreen--without  any\n\nwrongdoing  on   its  part--became  a   holder  of   property\n\nwrongfully taken by  Sentry or others from Quinaquisset.   In\n\nthat case,  whether by  recision, constructive trust  or some\n\nother theory  or device, perhaps the property  could (in some\n\ncircumstances)  be reached  even though  in the  hands of  an\n\ninnocent possessor.\n\n     The district court foreclosed this possibility by ruling\n\non September  10,  1991, that  the June  22, 1990,  agreement\n\nbetween  the parties  prevented  such a  recovery.   Treating\n\nEvergreen's title  as derived from the  foreclosure sale, the\n\ndistrict  court interpreted  the  agreement  as preventing  a\n\nsubsequent  attack  on the  resulting  title  and ruled  that\n\n\"Evergreen owns the  property free of any title defect  . . .\n\n.\"  Quinaquisset asserts that the district court misconstrued\n\nthe agreement, ignoring the reservation of rights provisos.\n\n                             -9-\n\n     Subject  to the rights reservations, Quinaquisset agreed\n\nin  the June 22 document not to obstruct the foreclosure sale\n\n\"or  to  take  any  further action  subsequent  thereto  with\n\nreference  to  the  validity  of  said  foreclosures  or  the\n\n[m]ortgages  relating thereto . . . .\"  Evergreen argues that\n\n\"[t]he    clear meaning  of  the [agreement]  . .  .  is that\n\nQuinaquisset agrees not  to take any  action to challenge  or\n\nimpair the foreclosure purchaser's title in Willowbend.\"  The\n\nreservations  of  rights, it  argues,  were  meant to  retain\n\nQuinaquisset's damage claims, and  not its right to institute\n\na  future  action  affecting   title  to  Willowbend  or  the\n\nattendant permit rights.\n\n     We think this interpretation not quite so clear as  does\n\nEvergreen, the agreement being something less than a model of\n\nclarity.   There  is, after  all, no  express promise  not to\n\n\"challenge or  impair  the foreclosure  purchaser's title  in\n\nWillowbend.\"  But we agree that Evergreen's reading, endorsed\n\nby  the  district  court,  is  better  than  any  alternative\n\nreading, considering  the general language used (\"any further\n\naction  .  .  .  with  reference  to  the  validity  of  said\n\nforeclosures or  the [m]ortgages relating  thereto\") together\n\nwith the  purpose to protect the  foreclosure-sale buyer that\n\none  would expect in such circumstances.  If the \"any further\n\naction\"  promise is  read in  this way,  then  it is  easy to\n\n                             -10-\n\nconstrue  the  even  more  general  language  of  the  rights\n\nreservations to relate to other claims such as damages.\n\n     We might  be more hesitant  to reach this  conclusion if\n\nQuinaquisset had offered to us and the district court another\n\nreasonable reading of the \"any  further action\" clause, or if\n\nit  pointed to evidence produced or  promised in the district\n\ncourt  to show that the  parties intended the  clause to have\n\nsome other meaning.   But no other reading has  been tendered\n\nand  no   such  evidence   has  been  proffered.     Instead,\n\nQuinaquisset emphasizes the rights reservations which, as  we\n\nhave noted, are quite  general, ought not readily be  read to\n\ntake back  in the proviso  what Quinaquisset appears  to have\n\npromised immediately before, and  can easily be understood to\n\nrefer to other remedies such as damages.\n\n     Given  the  district  court's  interpretation  which  we\n\nsustain it becomes fruitless for Quinaquisset to argue, as it\n\ndoes  at  length, that  it might  otherwise  have a  claim to\n\nrecover  the permits  from Evergreen.   Assuming it  had such\n\nclaims,  whether by  recision or  constructive trust,  it has\n\nsurrendered them  by  the agreement.    This court  need  not\n\ndecide  Quinaquisset's alternative,  last ditch  and facially\n\ndoubtful argument that  Evergreen never acquired the  permits\n\nat all  (allegedly because  their acquisition  by Fox  Run in\n\nOctober  1987  was  \"illegal\");  the  claim  cut  off by  the\n\njudgment is  Quinaquisset's claim  to  recover property  from\n\n                             -11-\n\nEvergreen.    The judgment  does  not  address property  that\n\nEvergreen never received in the foreclosure.\n\n                             IV.\n\n     Turning now to  the remaining claims  against Evergreen,\n\nwe sustain their  dismissal on  a ground not  adopted by  the\n\ndistrict court.

Both parties  treat  the district  court  as\n\nhaving  dismissed those  claims in  reliance on  the D'Oench,\n                                                             \n\nDuhme  doctrine, and we believe this is  so.  But there is no\n     \n\ndistrict  court opinion applying D'Oench, Duhme to Evergreen.\n                                               \n\nAlthough  the  district court  did  discuss  the doctrine  as\n\napplied  to  the  RTC,   Quinaquisset  seeks  to  distinguish\n\nEvergreen's status under  the doctrine.  We  think that there\n\nis  in  the  foreground  of  this  case  another   basis  for\n\nsustaining  the  dismissal--the  failure  to  state  a  claim\n\nagainst Evergreen--and we rest  our affirmance on that basis.\n\n     Evergreen is admittedly a  separate corporation and  was\n\napparently  not  a party  to  Fox  Run's  acquisition of  the\n\npermits or the  Fox Run-Sentry agreement.   The complaint may\n\nin  a literal  sense \"charge\" Evergreen  with wrongs  such as\n\nfraud, misappropriation, and unfair competition; but no facts\n\nare  ever alleged  that connect  Evergreen with  the wrongful\n\nacts  described.   The  complaint  does  nakedly assert  that\n\n                             -12-\n\nEvergreen is the \"alter ego\" of Sentry, the implication being\n\nthat it  is thereby  responsible for Sentry's  conduct.   Yet\n\nQuinaquisset  alleges no  facts that,  if proved,  would even\n\narguably permit a court to impose liability on Evergreen  for\n\nthe  acts of  its parent  under  an alter  ego  theory.

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)\n\nat the outset.   At the start, a reasonable  basis for belief\n\n                             -13-\n\nand an outline of what one might reasonably hope to prove may\n\nsuffice to permit discovery and ward off premature motions to\n\ndismiss.   But Quinaquisset's complaint  against Evergreen is\n\ndeficient;   this  litigation  has persisted  for almost  two\n\nyears;  and yet  even  now Quinaquisset  is  still unable  to\n\nexplain  what  exactly  it  is  that  Evergreen  did that  is\n\nwrongful.  The only claims at issue on this appeal are  those\n\nrelating  to Evergreen.   No amount of  embellished attack on\n\nFox  Run, Sentry or the RTC can replace what Quinaquisset has\n\nstill not supplied: a single, coherent, specific  description\n\nof what Evergreen has done that is wrongful.\n\n     Our appraisal of Quinaquisset's claims against Evergreen\n\nis without prejudice to whatever claims it may assert against\n\nothers.   Part of its predicament  may be of its  own making:\n\nfor unexplained  reasons, it released  a mortgage on  part of\n\nWillowbend, reconveyed valuable permit rights to Fox Run, and\n\ntook back an unsecured note on which Fox Run later defaulted.\n\nOn  the other hand,  this misstep, if  such it was,  does not\n\npreclude  the   possibility  that   out  of  the   welter  of\n\nsurrounding events  a claim was created  against other active\n\nparticipants.  Whether this  is so, and if so  whether such a\n\nclaim is  nevertheless barred by D'Oench,  Duhme, are matters\n                                                \n\non which we have no occasion to pass at this time.\n\n     We conclude that, apart from seeking to recover property\n\nfrom Evergreen, Quinaquisset has failed to state a claim upon\n\n                             -14-\n\nwhich  relief can be granted.  The property recovery claim is\n\nbarred by the agreement for reasons already stated.  Thus the\n\nbalance of the claims fail under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and\n\non this ground  we affirm the  district court's dismissal  of\n\nthose  claims.  It will  be time enough  to consider D'Oench,\n                                                             \n\nDuhme  when  the rest  of  this  litigation, now  nine-tenths\n     \n\nsubmerged like the proverbial iceberg, reaches this court.\n\n     Affirmed. \n             \n\n                             -15-\n</pre>",
