George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n             [Hon. David M. Cohen, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                   Selya and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n                      and Smith,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Michael B.

During its last term, the Supreme\n\nCourt held that a violation of the \"knock and announce\" rule in the\n\ncourse   of   executing      a    search    warrant   did    not    justify   the\n\nsuppression of evidence subsequently discovered.                   See Hudson v.\n\nMichigan, 126 S. Ct. 2159 (2006).               This appeal requires us to\n\ndetermine whether Hudson should be extended to a knock and announce\n\nviolation committed in the course of executing an arrest warrant.\n\nWe conclude that the Hudson Court's reasoning mandates such an\n\nextension.    That conclusion, coupled with our conclusion that the\n\ndefendant's other arguments are unavailing, prompts us to affirm\n\nthe judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           The    relevant       facts   are   assembled    in   the   magistrate\n\njudge's recommended decision, see United States v. Pelletier, No.\n\nCRIM. 05-09, 2005 WL 1800084, at *1 (D. Me. July 27, 2005), which\n\nthe district court adopted in denying the motion to suppress.                  We\n\nassume the reader's familiarity with this exegetic account and\n\nrehearse here only those facts that are needed to place the appeal\n\nin perspective.\n\n           On December 30, 2004, the United States Parole Commission\n\nissued an arrest warrant for multiple parole violations (all\n\ninvolving the use of controlled substances) directed at defendant-\n\nappellant Joseph Pelletier.          Around the same time, the Maine Drug\n\nEnforcement Agency and the Topsham police department, having come\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fto suspect that the defendant was dealing drugs, obtained a state\n\n\"no-knock\" warrant authorizing the search of the defendant's home\n\non Augusta Road in Bowdoin, Maine.                Deputy United States Marshals\n\ncharged with executing the federal arrest warrant coordinated their\n\nefforts with the officers assigned to execute the state search\n\nwarrant.\n\n              At around 7:00 a.m. on the morning of January 21, 2005,\n\na team of law enforcement agents arrived at the Augusta Road\n\nresidence.      The agents effected an entry by main force.                       Once\n\ninside,      they   encountered       the    defendant's        girlfriend,   Cheryl\n\nSprague. As the search progressed, some of the officers questioned\n\nSprague and her sister, Jennifer Sewall (who arrived at the house\n\nshortly after the entry).         Both women disclaimed any knowledge of\n\nthe defendant's whereabouts.\n\n              Officers    then   repaired         to   the   Sewall   residence    and\n\ninterviewed Jennifer's husband.               He ruminated that the defendant\n\nmight   be     at   a    motel   in    Augusta,        Maine.      Jennifer   Sewall\n\nsubsequently confirmed that the defendant was staying in room 151\n\nat the Econo Lodge Motel.\n\n              The officers reached the motel at about 9:00 a.m.                   They\n\nlearned that room 151 was registered in Jennifer Sewall's name.\n\nWhen shown a photograph, however, a maintenance man identified the\n\ndefendant as the occupant.            At that juncture, about six to eight\n\nofficers lined up outside the room. An officer knocked loudly four\n\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\for   five    times     in    rapid     succession,        eliciting    no    response.\n\nApproximately ten to fifteen seconds after the first knock, the\n\nofficer used a passkey obtained from the maintenance man to open\n\nthe door.     He yelled \"Police!\" while his comrades fanned out into\n\nthe room.     They found the defendant face-down on the bed.\n\n             The defendant offered no resistance as the officers\n\nhandcuffed him.         The room contained drug paraphernalia in plain\n\nview, including a glass crack pipe, a propane torch, steel wool,\n\nglassine baggies, and hypodermic needles.                     In a partially open\n\ndrawer, the officers observed a thick wad of cash (later determined\n\nto   aggregate       $4,740)    and    a   plastic    container       of    an   unknown\n\nsubstance (later determined to be heroin).                   The Marshals arrested\n\nthe defendant for parole violations and, according to prosecution\n\nwitnesses, the defendant was informed of his Miranda rights.                          See\n\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444-45 (1966).\n\n             In due course, a federal grand jury charged the defendant\n\nwith   a    single    count    of     possession     of    heroin   with     intent    to\n\ndistribute.      See 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).                In a pretrial motion to\n\nsuppress, the defendant argued that the officers' failure to comply\n\nwith   the    knock    and     announce    rule    demanded      exclusion       of   all\n\nsubsequently gathered evidence and statements.                      See Wong Sun v.\n\nUnited States, 371 U.S. 471, 484-88 (1963) (outlawing prosecutorial\n\nuse of \"fruits of the poisonous tree\").                   As part of this argument,\n\nhe asserted that the arrest warrant did not justify an entry into\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fhis motel room; that the authorities needed to have a search\n\nwarrant before seizing any items; and that his statements should be\n\nsuppressed because they had been obtained involuntarily.\n\n            The district court referred the suppression motion to a\n\nmagistrate judge. Following an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate\n\njudge determined that the only preserved issues were (i) the effect\n\nof the officers' noncompliance with the knock and announce rule and\n\n(ii) the alleged involuntariness of the defendant's statements.1\n\nHe resolved both issues in the government's favor.                   Although the\n\ngovernment    conceded      the   knock       and    announce     violation,      the\n\nmagistrate judge, ruling before the Supreme Court decided Hudson,\n\nfound that exigent circumstances justified the failure properly to\n\nknock and announce.        As to the second issue, the magistrate judge\n\nfound that the police had administered appropriate Miranda warnings\n\nand that no impermissible promises or threats had been made.\n\n            Based on these findings, the magistrate judge recommended\n\nwholesale    denial   of    the   motion      to    suppress.      The   defendant\n\nobjected,    but   the     district     court       nonetheless     embraced      the\n\nrecommendation     and   denied   the     motion.       See   United     States   v.\n\nPelletier, No. CRIM. 05-09, 2005 WL 2030480, at *1 (D. Me. Aug. 23,\n\n2005). The defendant thereafter entered a conditional guilty plea,\n\nreserving the right to appeal the suppression rulings. See Fed. R.\n\n     1\n      In deciding what issues were live, the magistrate judge\ndetermined, among other things, that the defendant had waived any\nchallenge to the sufficiency of the administrative warrant. This\ndetermination has not been challenged on appeal.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fCrim. P. 11(a)(2).       The district court sentenced the defendant as\n\na career offender to a 151-month incarcerative term.                This appeal\n\nensued.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n            On appeal, the defendant advances three arguments.                His\n\nflagship claim is that the officers' admitted failure to comply\n\nwith the knock and announce rule rendered their entry into the\n\nmotel room unconstitutional (and, thus, required suppression of all\n\nthe   evidence    that     the   illegal    entry    yielded).      Second,   the\n\ndefendant asseverates that his statements should be suppressed\n\nbecause they were obtained involuntarily. Third, and finally, he\n\ncomplains of sentencing error.               We consider these contentions\n\nsequentially.\n\n                           A.    Knock and Announce.\n\n            We begin with the government's conceded violation of the\n\nknock and announce rule.         That rule, extant at common law, has been\n\ncodified in a federal statute that provides:\n\n            The officer may break open any outer or inner\n            door or window of a house, or any part of a\n            house, or anything therein, to execute a\n            search warrant, if, after notice of his\n            authority   and   purpose,  he   is   refused\n            admittance or when necessary to liberate\n            himself or a person aiding him in the\n            execution of the warrant.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3109.        The rule is not a freestanding expression of\n\npolicy    but,   rather,    is   \"a   command   of   the   Fourth   Amendment.\"\n\nHudson, 126 S. Ct. at 2162.                It applies equally to officers\n\n                                       -6-\n\fwielding arrest warrants and officers wielding search warrants.\n\nSee United States v. Alejandro, 368 F.3d 130, 133 (2d Cir. 2004).\n\n            In terms, the rule requires law enforcement officers to\n\nknock and announce their presence and authority prior to effecting\n\na non-consensual entry into a dwelling. See Richards v. Wisconsin,\n\n520 U.S. 385, 387 (1997); Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U.S. 927, 929\n\n(1995). It is well-settled, however, that in exigent circumstances\n\nlaw enforcement officers may eschew compliance with the rule.             See\n\nUnited States v. Ramirez, 523 U.S. 65, 70, 73 (1998); Richards, 520\n\nU.S. at 391, 394-95.\n\n            During the pendency of this appeal, the Hudson Court\n\nadded a further refinement.         In that case, the police had obtained\n\na warrant to search for drugs and guns at Hudson's abode.             While\n\nexecuting the warrant, the officers announced their presence, but\n\ntarried only three to five seconds before turning the doorknob and\n\nentering.    See Hudson, 126 S. Ct. at 2162.\n\n            Hudson   sought    suppression    of   evidence   subsequently\n\ngleaned on the ground that the premature entry violated his Fourth\n\nAmendment rights.    The Court reiterated the interests protected by\n\nthe knock and announce rule, including the preemption of violent\n\nself-defense   measures,      the   safeguarding   of   property,   and   the\n\nrespecting of human dignity.            Id. at 2165.      It proceeded to\n\ndistinguish those interests from the interests protected by, for\n\nexample, the requirement of a valid search warrant, the core\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fpurpose   of   which   is   to   shield   \"persons,   houses,    papers,    and\n\neffects\" from desultory government scrutiny.            Id. (quoting U.S.\n\nConst. amend. IV).          As compared to the latter, exclusion of\n\nevidence obtained in the case of a knock and announce violation\n\nsimpliciter would not serve to vindicate the interests at stake.\n\nId. at 2164-65. Weighing the potential deterrent value of applying\n\nthe exclusionary rule against the potential social costs, the Court\n\nconcluded that the balance did not favor exclusion.             Id. at 2165-\n\n68.\n\n            In the case at hand, the defendant's opening brief, filed\n\nprior to the Hudson Court's decision, argued that no exigent\n\ncircumstance justified the officers' noncompliance with the knock\n\nand announce rule (and that, therefore, the entry was illegal).\n\nThe opinion in Hudson makes clear, however, that an inquiring court\n\nshould    undertake    an   exigent   circumstances     analysis     only   to\n\ndetermine whether there has been a knock and announce violation in\n\nthe first instance, not to determine if, in the face of an\n\nacknowledged violation, evidence should be suppressed.             See id. at\n\n2163.    Recognizing the import of this clarification, the defendant\n\nshifted gears in his reply brief and attempted to distinguish\n\nHudson by arguing that here, unlike in Hudson, there was no\n\nunderlying     authority    to   enter    the   premises.       Although    the\n\ngovernment maintains that the defendant paid insufficient attention\n\nto this argument below, the timing of the Hudson decision and the\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fambiguities in the record prompt us to meet the argument head-on.\n\nWe proceed to that task.\n\n             It is black-letter law that an arrest warrant carries\n\nwith it, by implication, a limited grant of authority to enter the\n\ntarget's residence so long as there is reason to believe that the\n\ntarget is inside.          See Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 603\n\n(1980). Generally speaking, this principle extends to the target's\n\nhotel or motel room, since such an accommodation is akin to a\n\ntemporary residence.        See Stoner v. California, 376 U.S. 483, 490\n\n(1964); United States v. Beaudoin, 362 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.\n\n2004);2 see also United States v. Weems, 322 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (noting in dictum that if the defendant \"effectively lived\"\n\nwhere he was found, \"the arrest warrant itself would be enough to\n\nauthorize entry . . . to effectuate his arrest\").           Here, however,\n\nthere are two possible barriers that prevent us from summarily\n\nresolving the authority-to-enter issue on the basis of these\n\nprecedents.\n\n             First, the defendant suggests that the motel room was not\n\nhis because it was registered to Jennifer Sewall.           The suggestion\n\nis   that,    at   least    in   the   absence   of   consent   or   exigent\n\ncircumstances, \"even when armed with an arrest warrant, police must\n\n\n     2\n      The Supreme Court vacated the judgment in Beaudoin, albeit as\nto a codefendant, on a sentence-related ground. See Champagne v.\nUnited States, 543 U.S. 1102 (2005). The validity of the Beaudoin\ncourt's Fourth Amendment analysis is unaffected by that\ndevelopment.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fgenerally have a search warrant to enter lawfully a third person's\n\nhome.\"   Joyce v. Town of Tewksbury, 112 F.3d 19, 21-22 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (en banc) (per curiam).          This potential barrier is easily\n\nsurmounted.\n\n            Leaving aside an obvious concern about the defendant's\n\nstanding to raise this point at all, cf. Minnesota v. Carter, 525\n\nU.S. 83, 91 (1998) (holding that non-resident defendants had no\n\nlegitimate expectation of privacy in apartment in which they\n\nbriefly conducted drug-dealing activities), the Joyce pronouncement\n\ndoes not help the defendant.       The reason behind the pronouncement\n\nis clear: \"[a]rmed solely with an arrest warrant for a single\n\nperson, the police could search all the homes of that individual's\n\nfriends and acquaintances.\"       Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S.\n\n204, 215 (1981).\n\n            It is readily evident that this reasoning finds no\n\ntraction in the soil of this case.        The record makes manifest that\n\nregardless of the name in which the motel room was registered, the\n\ndefendant — and only the defendant — was occupying it.        After all,\n\nat the suppression hearing the defendant admitted that he had been\n\n\"staying\"     at   the   motel   for   \"[a]pproximately   three   weeks.\"\n\nMoreover, throughout his appellate briefs the defendant refers to\n\nthe room as \"his room\" or \"his hotel room.\"       See, e.g., Appellant's\n\nBr. at 30, 35.      There is no evidence that either Jennifer Sewall\n\n(who informed the officers that she lived with her husband, not at\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fthe motel) or any other individual occupied the room during the\n\nrelevant time frame.\n\n               That    gets    the    grease    from   the   goose.        Because   the\n\ndefendant was the sole resident of room 151, the officers' entry on\n\nthe    basis    of     a    warrant    for    the   defendant's     arrest    did    not\n\njeopardize       any       cognizable    third-party      interest.         Joyce    is,\n\ntherefore, inapposite.\n\n               The second potential barrier arises out of the fact that\n\nPayton authorized an entry of a dwelling pursuant to an arrest\n\nwarrant founded on probable cause.                  See Payton, 445 U.S. at 603.\n\nIn this instance, the arresting officers wielded a parole violation\n\nwarrant, see 18 U.S.C. § 4213, which by its terms was issued on the\n\nbasis of \"reliable information\" that the defendant had breached the\n\nconditions of his parole.             In some cases, such a distinction might\n\nmake    a   dispositive        difference.          Cf.   Skinner     v.    Ry.   Labor\n\nExecutives' Ass'n, 489 U.S. 602, 619 (1989) (\"Except in certain\n\nwell-defined circumstances, a search or seizure . . . is not\n\nreasonable unless it is accomplished pursuant to a judicial warrant\n\nissued upon probable cause.\").                 Here, however, that is not the\n\ncase.\n\n               Although the nature of the instant warrant might appear\n\nat first blush to cut against the government, it in fact cuts the\n\nother way.           It is settled beyond hope of contradiction that\n\nparolees are not entitled to the same panoply of Fourth Amendment\n\n\n\n                                             -11-\n\fprotections as are ordinary citizens.             See Samson v. California,\n\n126   S.   Ct.    2193,    2198   (2006);   see    also   United    States   v.\n\nWinchenbach, 197 F.3d 548, 553 (1st Cir. 1999) (explaining that an\n\nexception to Payton's arrest warrant requirement applies in cases\n\nof parolees and probationers).          Thus, a valid parole violation\n\nwarrant, issued on the basis of reasonable grounds to believe that\n\na parolee has violated the conditions of his parole, is adequate to\n\nsupport an entry into the parolee's domicile for the purpose of\n\nexecuting the warrant.       See United States v. Cardona, 903 F.2d 60,\n\n69 (1st Cir. 1990).         It is immaterial to this Fourth Amendment\n\nanalysis that no parole or probation officer is present when law\n\nenforcement agents enter the parolee's premises to execute the\n\nwarrant.    See id.\n\n            Here, the magistrate judge supportably found that the\n\ndefendant had waived any challenge to the validity of the parole\n\nviolation warrant.        See supra note 1.    On appeal the defendant has\n\nnot attempted to argue that the warrant was issued on the basis of\n\na constitutionally infirm predicate. We must, therefore, treat the\n\nparole violation warrant as valid and enforceable.              Doing so, we\n\nconclude   that    the    warrant   provided   the   officers      with   lawful\n\nauthority to enter the motel room for the purpose of arresting the\n\ndefendant.\n\n            That ends this aspect of the appeal. Because Hudson\n\napplies with equal force in the context of an arrest warrant, the\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fdistrict court did not err in refusing to order suppression based\n\nupon the officers' conceded violation of the knock and announce\n\nrule.\n\n                        B.   Voluntariness.\n\n          Next, the defendant maintains that his statements to the\n\nauthorities should be suppressed because they were obtained in\n\nviolation of his constitutional rights.       He claims that, after\n\nadministering Miranda warnings,3 the officers dangled improper\n\nincentives to secure his cooperation, such as offering to ditch\n\ncertain incriminating evidence — he says that one of the officers\n\nwent so far as to stomp on a glass crack pipe, shattering it while\n\npromising that, in return for cooperation, \"[w]e can forget about\n\nthis stuff\" — and assuring him that cooperation would make it less\n\nlikely that he would be classified as a career offender.\n\n          The magistrate judge, who saw and heard the witnesses at\n\nthe suppression hearing, credited the officers' testimony that,\n\nfrom the outset, the defendant was cooperative, responsive, and\n\nkeenly interested in what they might be able to do to make his lot\n\neasier.   The judge found that no untoward threats or promises had\n\nbeen voiced; the officers merely conveyed to the defendant that\n\nthey \"would discuss with the prosecution the extent to which he had\n\n\n     3\n      The defendant questioned below whether Miranda warnings were\nadministered.   The magistrate judge found as a fact that such\nwarnings had been given in a timely manner. See Pelletier, 2005 WL\n1800084, at *14. The defendant does not contest that finding on\nappeal.\n\n                                -13-\n\fcooperated.\"        Pelletier, 2005 WL 1800084, at *15.            Relatedly, the\n\nmagistrate      judge      found   that    the    defendant's    version      of   the\n\nencounter, including his hyperbolic account of the crack pipe\n\nincident, was not credible.           Id. at *6 n.11, *15.\n\n               On appeal, the defendant faces a steep uphill climb.                 We\n\nmust accept the lower court's findings of fact as long as they are\n\nnot clearly erroneous and subject its conclusions of law to de novo\n\nreview.    See Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996);\n\nUnited States v. Coplin, 463 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n               In   this    instance,     the     challenged    determination      is\n\nfactbound and, thus, subject to clear error review.                     See United\n\nStates    v.    Pagán-Santini,      451    F.3d    258,   262   (1st   Cir.   2006).\n\nMoreover, that determination was largely the product of credibility\n\ncalls — and the trier's assessments of witness credibility are\n\ntreated on appeal with great respect.               See, e.g., United States v.\n\nLaine, 270 F.3d 71, 75 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Charles,\n\n213 F.3d 10, 18 (1st Cir. 2000).             Scouring the record, we discern\n\nno error, clear or otherwise, in the magistrate judge's findings.\n\n               To say more on this subject would be to paint the lily.\n\nA determination about whether police coercion has taken place\n\ninevitably hinges on the totality of the circumstances.                       United\n\nStates v. Byram, 145 F.3d 405, 408 (1st Cir. 1998).                      Given the\n\nfacts as supportably found by the magistrate judge, there is no\n\n\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fprincipled basis for concluding that the defendant's statements\n\nwere involuntary.\n\n                            C.    Sentencing.\n\n          The defendant's sentencing challenge has two facets.\n\nFirst, he argues that the district court incorrectly classified him\n\nas a career offender under USSG §4B1.1 (2004).            Second, he argues\n\nthat the court gave undue weight to the guidelines and failed to\n\nconsider factors warranting a more lenient sentence.              We address\n\nthese arguments separately.\n\n          1.   Career Offender Status.         The sentencing guidelines\n\nprovide in pertinent part that a defendant will be designated a\n\ncareer offender if he \"has at least two prior felony convictions of\n\neither a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\"\n\nUSSG §4B1.1(a)(3).      Here, the defendant insists that the record\n\ncontains no competent proof of his career offender status.                 The\n\ngovernment   counters   that     the    defendant   did   not   preserve   any\n\nchallenge to the adequacy of proof and that, in any event, the\n\nchallenge fails on the merits.          Because the record below reflects\n\nthat the defendant objected on several occasions to his designation\n\nas a career offender, we assume, for argument's sake, that his\n\nadequacy of proof challenge has been preserved for appeal.\n\n          The essential facts are as follows.             At the disposition\n\nhearing, the prosecutor, referring to the presentence investigation\n\nreport (PSI Report), argued that the defendant should be considered\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fa career offender because he had twice been convicted of predicate\n\noffenses (and, thus, had crossed the career offender threshold).\n\nThe prosecutor based this argument on two predicate convictions: a\n\n1986   federal     conviction   and    a   1995     Maine   state   conviction.\n\nAccording to the PSI Report, the federal conviction, which yielded\n\na 10-year prison term, was for possession with intent to distribute\n\ncocaine    and    conspiracy    to    commit      that   offense.     The   state\n\nconviction, which resulted in a sentence of nine years (five\n\nsuspended), was for drug trafficking.                The prosecutor, without\n\nobjection, introduced a certified copy of the state conviction. As\n\nto the federal conviction (which had occurred in the District of\n\nMaine), the prosecutor indicated that, if the court deemed it\n\nnecessary, she could \"go downstairs and get a certified copy.\"                 No\n\none made such a request.\n\n               On appeal, the defendant strives to convince us that the\n\ngovernment's proof of the federal conviction was inadequate under\n\nShepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005), and that, therefore,\n\nthe \"two predicate convictions\" requirement was not satisfied.                 We\n\nare not persuaded.\n\n               The short of it is that Shepard and its progenitor,\n\nTaylor    v.    United   States,     495   U.S.    575   (1990),    address   the\n\nappropriate sources for ascertaining the elements of a putative\n\npredicate offense when the statute of conviction encompasses both\n\nconduct that would constitute a predicate offense and conduct that\n\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fwould not.   See Shepard, 544 U.S. at 16; Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602;\n\nsee generally United States v. Turbides-Leonardo, ___ F.3d ___, ___\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) [No. 05-2374, slip op. at 8-9]; Conteh v. Gonzales,\n\n461 F.3d 45, 53 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          Here, however, the defendant has offered no coherent\n\nattack on the match between the elements of his prior federal\n\nconviction and the description of \"a controlled substance offense\"\n\nwithin the purview of USSG §4B1.1(a)(3).      Instead, he seems to\n\nconcede, as he must, that possession with intent to distribute\n\ncocaine is unarguably a predicate offense under the career offender\n\nguideline; he argues only that the government failed to produce\n\nevidence of the fact of his federal conviction.\n\n          That argument is jejune.    For one thing, the defendant\n\ndid not object to the recital of the federal conviction in the PSI\n\nReport — and in the absence of any objection, a statement in a\n\npresentence report is sufficient to prove the fact proposed.   See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Arrieta-Buendia, 372 F.3d 953, 955-56 (8th\n\nCir. 2004) (explaining that, absent an objection, a PSI Report may\n\nbe a permissible source of information about a prior conviction for\n\nsentence-enhancement purposes).    For another thing, the sentencing\n\ncourt had the capacity to take judicial notice of its own records,\n\nsee St. Louis Baptist Temple, Inc. v. FDIC, 605 F.2d 1169, 1172\n\n(10th Cir. 1979); Fed. R. Evid. 201, which in this instance would\n\n\n\n\n                               -17-\n\fhave cemented the existence of the earlier federal conviction.              No\n\nmore was exigible.\n\n           2.        Reasonableness.        The defendant's last remaining\n\nplaint is that the district court viewed the available sentencing\n\noptions too grudgingly. He excerpts the following passage from the\n\ndistrict judge's comments at the disposition hearing:\n\n           Mr. Pelletier, when I looked at your file\n           earlier . . . I was tempted to give you the\n           maximum sentence. The reason I'm not going to\n           give you 188 months is because you don't have\n           any history of violence.\n\nAccording to the defendant, the description of 188 months as \"the\n\nmaximum   sentence\"      shows   that   the     district   court   viewed   the\n\nguidelines      as    establishing      a     mandatory    sentencing   range.\n\nRelatedly, the defendant charges that the district court gave\n\ninsufficient consideration to the factors made relevant by 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a), mulling those factors only with respect to fixing\n\na possible sentence somewhere within the guideline range.               Neither\n\nargument withstands scrutiny.\n\n           The Supreme Court's landmark decision in United States v.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. 220, 245 (2005), rendered the guidelines advisory.\n\nIn the aftermath of Booker, we review a district court's sentence\n\nfor reasonableness.       Id. at 261.       That standard of review applies\n\nwhether the actual sentence falls inside or outside the guideline\n\nsentencing range. See Turbides-Leonardo, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fat 12-13]; United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 517 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n            In constructing a sentence under an advisory guidelines\n\nregime, a sentencing court ordinarily should begin by calculating\n\nthe applicable guideline sentencing range; then determine whether\n\nor   not   any   departures   are   in   order;   then   mull   the   factors\n\ndelineated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) as well as any other relevant\n\nconsiderations; and, finally, determine what sentence, whether\n\nwithin, above, or below the guideline sentencing range, appears\n\nappropriate. See United States v. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194, 203-04 (1st\n\nCir. 2006); Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518-19.\n\n            In this instance, the district court, called upon to\n\nsentence the defendant without the benefit of our clarifying\n\nopinion in Jiménez-Beltre, correctly anticipated this approach.\n\nExcept for his abortive challenge to the court's use of the career\n\noffender provision, previously rejected, the defendant effectively\n\nconcedes the correctness of the calculated guideline sentencing\n\nrange (151-188 months).       By the same token, he raises no question\n\nabout the sentencing court's eschewal of any and all departures.\n\nHis attack, rather, strikes at the third and fourth steps of the\n\nsentencing pavane.     He posits that the sentencing court overvalued\n\nthe impact of the guideline sentencing range and, relatedly, failed\n\nto attach due weight to his advanced age (55), his long struggle\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fwith drug addiction, his poor health, his cooperation with the\n\nauthorities, and the sexual abuse that he endured as a child.\n\n          To begin, the defendant's reliance on the above-quoted\n\nexcerpt from the sentencing transcript is misplaced.        Looking at\n\nthe disposition hearing as a whole, it is perfectly clear that the\n\ndistrict court appreciated the advisory nature of the guidelines\n\nand acted accordingly.    The court's use of the word \"maximum\" was,\n\nat worst, an awkward locution — even that is a stretch — and we\n\nwill not read more into it than the context fairly suggests.       Cf.\n\nLenn v. Portland Sch. Comm., 998 F.2d 1083, 1088 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(disregarding \"infelicitous choice of phrase\" where record as a\n\nwhole made manifest that district court had undertaken proper\n\nanalysis). There is simply no indication that the sentencing court\n\novervalued the guidelines.\n\n          Moving to the allegedly mitigating factors, the defendant\n\nraised each of these considerations at sentencing.        The district\n\ncourt, without rehashing the defendant's importunings, explained\n\nthat it had \"taken into account [the section 3553(a)] factors,\"\n\n\"carefully considered the Sentencing Guideline Range set forth in\n\nthe advisory Sentencing Guidelines,\" and determined that a 151-\n\nmonth sentence was appropriate. In arriving at this determination,\n\nthe court gave significant weight to the defendant's recidivism,\n\nhis   repeated   parole   violations,   his   unexcused   flight   from\n\nsupervision, and the fact that he had committed the offense of\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fconviction while on parole. The court concluded that, in its view,\n\nthe defendant was not \"capable or willing to follow the rules of\n\nsociety, and after having numerous chances . . . a sentence of 151\n\nmonths is entirely appropriate.\"\n\n            In our view, the overall sentence is unimpugnable.         The\n\ndistrict court took into account the mitigating circumstances\n\nraised by the defendant and the factors delineated in section\n\n3553(a), determined that the defendant's persistent reversion to\n\ncriminal activity was inexcusable, and sentenced him at the nadir\n\nof the applicable guideline sentencing range.           Even if the court\n\nwere terse in rejecting the defendant's argument for mitigation,\n\nthat terseness would not have undermined the reasonableness of the\n\nsentence.   See, e.g., Turbides-Leonardo, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op.\n\nat 16] (noting that brevity in sentencing \"is not to be confused\n\nwith inattention\").\n\n            We   add   an   eschatocol    of   sorts.   Post-Booker,   the\n\nsentencing guidelines, though advisory, remain an important datum\n\nin constructing a reasonable sentence.             See United States v.\n\nNavedo-Concepción, 450 F.3d 54, 57, 59 (1st Cir. 2006); Jiménez-\n\nBeltre, 440 F.3d at 518. Consequently, a defendant who attempts to\n\nbrand a within-the-range sentence as unreasonable must carry a\n\nheavy burden.    See Turbides-Leonardo, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at\n\n15]; United States v. Smith, 445 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2006).         Here,\n\nthe sentencing court, which gave a sensible set of reasons for its\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fchoice of sentence, was not required to dwell on why some more\n\nlenient sentence would have been inadequate.       See, e.g., Jiménez-\n\nBeltre,     440   F.3d   at   519   (stating   that,   ordinarily,   the\n\nreasonableness requirement is satisfied when the court offers a\n\n\"plausible explanation\" for the chosen sentence and reaches a\n\n\"defensible overall result\").\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe uphold the judgment below in all particulars.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\f",

BACKGROUND\n\n           The    relevant       facts   are   assembled    in   the   magistrate\n\njudge's recommended decision, see United States v. Pelletier, No.\n\nCRIM. 05-09, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1800084</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (D. Me. July 27, 2005), which\n\nthe district court adopted in denying the motion to suppress.                  We\n\nassume the reader's familiarity with this exegetic account and\n\nrehearse here only those facts that are needed to place the appeal\n\nin perspective.\n\n           On December 30, 2004, the United States Parole Commission\n\nissued an arrest warrant for multiple parole violations (all\n\ninvolving the use of controlled substances) directed at defendant-\n\nappellant Joseph Pelletier.          Around the same time, the Maine Drug\n\nEnforcement Agency and the Topsham police department, having come\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fto suspect that the defendant was dealing drugs, obtained a state\n\n\"no-knock\" warrant authorizing the search of the defendant's home\n\non Augusta Road in Bowdoin, Maine.                Deputy United States Marshals\n\ncharged with executing the federal arrest warrant coordinated their\n\nefforts with the officers assigned to execute the state search\n\nwarrant.\n\n              At around 7:00 a.m. on the morning of January 21, 2005,\n\na team of law enforcement agents arrived at the Augusta Road\n\nresidence.      The agents effected an entry by main force.                       Once\n\ninside,      they   encountered       the    defendant's        girlfriend,   Cheryl\n\nSprague. As the search progressed, some of the officers questioned\n\nSprague and her sister, Jennifer Sewall (who arrived at the house\n\nshortly after the entry).         Both women disclaimed any knowledge of\n\nthe defendant's whereabouts.\n\n              Officers    then   repaired         to   the   Sewall   residence    and\n\ninterviewed Jennifer's husband.               He ruminated that the defendant\n\nmight   be     at   a    motel   in    Augusta,        Maine.      Jennifer   Sewall\n\nsubsequently confirmed that the defendant was staying in room 151\n\nat the Econo Lodge Motel.\n\n              The officers reached the motel at about 9:00 a.m.                   They\n\nlearned that room 151 was registered in Jennifer Sewall's name.\n\nWhen shown a photograph, however, a maintenance man identified the\n\ndefendant as the occupant.            At that juncture, about six to eight\n\nofficers lined up outside the room. An officer knocked loudly four\n\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\for   five    times     in    rapid     succession,        eliciting    no    response.\n\nApproximately ten to fifteen seconds after the first knock, the\n\nofficer used a passkey obtained from the maintenance man to open\n\nthe door.     He yelled \"Police!\" while his comrades fanned out into\n\nthe room.     They found the defendant face-down on the bed.\n\n             The defendant offered no resistance as the officers\n\nhandcuffed him.         The room contained drug paraphernalia in plain\n\nview, including a glass crack pipe, a propane torch, steel wool,\n\nglassine baggies, and hypodermic needles.                     In a partially open\n\ndrawer, the officers observed a thick wad of cash (later determined\n\nto   aggregate       $4,740)    and    a   plastic    container       of    an   unknown\n\nsubstance (later determined to be heroin).                   The Marshals arrested\n\nthe defendant for parole violations and, according to prosecution\n\nwitnesses, the defendant was informed of his Miranda rights.                          See\n\nMiranda v.

See 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).

Following an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate\n\njudge determined that the only preserved issues were (i) the effect\n\nof the officers' noncompliance with the knock and announce rule and\n\n(ii) the alleged involuntariness of the defendant's statements.1\n\nHe resolved both issues in the government's favor.                   Although the\n\ngovernment    conceded      the   knock       and    announce     violation,      the\n\nmagistrate judge, ruling before the Supreme Court decided Hudson,\n\nfound that exigent circumstances justified the failure properly to\n\nknock and announce.        As to the second issue, the magistrate judge\n\nfound that the police had administered appropriate Miranda warnings\n\nand that no impermissible promises or threats had been made.\n\n            Based on these findings, the magistrate judge recommended\n\nwholesale    denial   of    the   motion      to    suppress.      The   defendant\n\nobjected,    but   the     district     court       nonetheless     embraced      the\n\nrecommendation     and   denied   the     motion.

The district court sentenced the defendant as\n\na career offender to a 151-month incarcerative term.                This appeal\n\nensued.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n            On appeal, the defendant advances three arguments.                His\n\nflagship claim is that the officers' admitted failure to comply\n\nwith the knock and announce rule rendered their entry into the\n\nmotel room unconstitutional (and, thus, required suppression of all\n\nthe   evidence    that     the   illegal    entry    yielded).      Second,   the\n\ndefendant asseverates that his statements should be suppressed\n\nbecause they were obtained involuntarily. Third, and finally, he\n\ncomplains of sentencing error.               We consider these contentions\n\nsequentially.\n\n                           A.    Knock and Announce.\n\n            We begin with the government's conceded violation of the\n\nknock and announce rule.         That rule, extant at common law, has been\n\ncodified in a federal statute that provides:\n\n            The officer may break open any outer or inner\n            door or window of a house, or any part of a\n            house, or anything therein, to execute a\n            search warrant, if, after notice of his\n            authority   and   purpose,  he   is   refused\n            admittance or when necessary to liberate\n            himself or a person aiding him in the\n            execution of the warrant.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3109.        The rule is not a freestanding expression of\n\npolicy    but,   rather,    is   \"a   command   of   the   Fourth   Amendment.\"\n\nHudson, 126 S. Ct. at 2162.                It applies equally to officers\n\n                                       -6-\n\fwielding arrest warrants and officers wielding search warrants.\n\nSee United States v.

See Richards v. Wisconsin,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118103\"><a href=\"/opinion/118103/richards-v-wisconsin/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 387 (1997); Wilson v.

It is well-settled, however, that in exigent circumstances\n\nlaw enforcement officers may eschew compliance with the rule.             See\n\nUnited States v. Ramirez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118180\"><a href=\"/opinion/118180/united-states-v-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 70, 73 (1998); Richards, 520\n\nU.S. at 391, 394-95.\n\n            During the pendency of this appeal, the Hudson Court\n\nadded a further refinement.         In that case, the police had obtained\n\na warrant to search for drugs and guns at Hudson's abode.             While\n\nexecuting the warrant, the officers announced their presence, but\n\ntarried only three to five seconds before turning the doorknob and\n\nentering.    See Hudson, 126 S. Ct. at 2162.\n\n            Hudson   sought    suppression    of   evidence   subsequently\n\ngleaned on the ground that the premature entry violated his Fourth\n\nAmendment rights.    The Court reiterated the interests protected by\n\nthe knock and announce rule, including the preemption of violent\n\nself-defense   measures,      the   safeguarding   of   property,   and   the\n\nrespecting of human dignity.            Id. at 2165.      It proceeded to\n\ndistinguish those interests from the interests protected by, for\n\nexample, the requirement of a valid search warrant, the core\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fpurpose   of   which   is   to   shield   \"persons,   houses,    papers,    and\n\neffects\" from desultory government scrutiny.            Id. (quoting U.S.\n\nConst. amend. IV).          As compared to the latter, exclusion of\n\nevidence obtained in the case of a knock and announce violation\n\nsimpliciter would not serve to vindicate the interests at stake.\n\nId. at 2164-65. Weighing the potential deterrent value of applying\n\nthe exclusionary rule against the potential social costs, the Court\n\nconcluded that the balance did not favor exclusion.             Id. at 2165-\n\n68.\n\n            In the case at hand, the defendant's opening brief, filed\n\nprior to the Hudson Court's decision, argued that no exigent\n\ncircumstance justified the officers' noncompliance with the knock\n\nand announce rule (and that, therefore, the entry was illegal).\n\nThe opinion in Hudson makes clear, however, that an inquiring court\n\nshould    undertake    an   exigent   circumstances     analysis     only   to\n\ndetermine whether there has been a knock and announce violation in\n\nthe first instance, not to determine if, in the face of an\n\nacknowledged violation, evidence should be suppressed.             See id. at\n\n2163.    Recognizing the import of this clarification, the defendant\n\nshifted gears in his reply brief and attempted to distinguish\n\nHudson by arguing that here, unlike in Hudson, there was no\n\nunderlying     authority    to   enter    the   premises.       Although    the\n\ngovernment maintains that the defendant paid insufficient attention\n\nto this argument below, the timing of the Hudson decision and the\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fambiguities in the record prompt us to meet the argument head-on.\n\nWe proceed to that task.\n\n             It is black-letter law that an arrest warrant carries\n\nwith it, by implication, a limited grant of authority to enter the\n\ntarget's residence so long as there is reason to believe that the\n\ntarget is inside.

Here, however,\n\nthere are two possible barriers that prevent us from summarily\n\nresolving the authority-to-enter issue on the basis of these\n\nprecedents.\n\n             First, the defendant suggests that the motel room was not\n\nhis because it was registered to Jennifer Sewall.

The validity of the Beaudoin\ncourt's Fourth Amendment analysis is unaffected by that\ndevelopment.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fgenerally have a search warrant to enter lawfully a third person's\n\nhome.\"   Joyce v. Town of Tewksbury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739950\"><a href=\"/opinion/739950/joanne-joyce-individually-and-as-of-the-estate-of-james-d-joyce-v-town/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21-22 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (en banc) (per curiam).          This potential barrier is easily\n\nsurmounted.\n\n            Leaving aside an obvious concern about the defendant's\n\nstanding to raise this point at all, cf. Minnesota v. Carter, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 (1998) (holding that non-resident defendants had no\n\nlegitimate expectation of privacy in apartment in which they\n\nbriefly conducted drug-dealing activities), the Joyce pronouncement\n\ndoes not help the defendant.       The reason behind the pronouncement\n\nis clear: \"[a]rmed solely with an arrest warrant for a single\n\nperson, the police could search all the homes of that individual's\n\nfriends and acquaintances.\"       Steagald v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110464\"><a href=\"/opinion/110464/steagald-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 215 (1981).\n\n            It is readily evident that this reasoning finds no\n\ntraction in the soil of this case.        The record makes manifest that\n\nregardless of the name in which the motel room was registered, the\n\ndefendant — and only the defendant — was occupying it.        After all,\n\nat the suppression hearing the defendant admitted that he had been\n\n\"staying\"     at   the   motel   for   \"[a]pproximately   three   weeks.\"\n\nMoreover, throughout his appellate briefs the defendant refers to\n\nthe room as \"his room\" or \"his hotel room.\"       See, e.g., Appellant's\n\nBr. at 30, 35.      There is no evidence that either Jennifer Sewall\n\n(who informed the officers that she lived with her husband, not at\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fthe motel) or any other individual occupied the room during the\n\nrelevant time frame.\n\n               That    gets    the    grease    from   the   goose.        Because   the\n\ndefendant was the sole resident of room 151, the officers' entry on\n\nthe    basis    of     a    warrant    for    the   defendant's     arrest    did    not\n\njeopardize       any       cognizable    third-party      interest.         Joyce    is,\n\ntherefore, inapposite.\n\n               The second potential barrier arises out of the fact that\n\nPayton authorized an entry of a dwelling pursuant to an arrest\n\nwarrant founded on probable cause.                  See Payton, 445 U.S. at 603.\n\nIn this instance, the arresting officers wielded a parole violation\n\nwarrant, see 18 U.S.C. § 4213, which by its terms was issued on the\n\nbasis of \"reliable information\" that the defendant had breached the\n\nconditions of his parole.             In some cases, such a distinction might\n\nmake    a   dispositive        difference.          Cf.   Skinner     v.    Ry.   Labor\n\nExecutives' Ass'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112219\"><a href=\"/opinion/112219/skinner-v-railway-labor-executives-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619 (1989) (\"Except in certain\n\nwell-defined circumstances, a search or seizure . . . is not\n\nreasonable unless it is accomplished pursuant to a judicial warrant\n\nissued upon probable cause.\").                 Here, however, that is not the\n\ncase.\n\n               Although the nature of the instant warrant might appear\n\nat first blush to cut against the government, it in fact cuts the\n\nother way.           It is settled beyond hope of contradiction that\n\nparolees are not entitled to the same panoply of Fourth Amendment\n\n\n\n                                             -11-\n\fprotections as are ordinary citizens.             See Samson v. California,\n\n126   S.

Thus, a valid parole violation\n\nwarrant, issued on the basis of reasonable grounds to believe that\n\na parolee has violated the conditions of his parole, is adequate to\n\nsupport an entry into the parolee's domicile for the purpose of\n\nexecuting the warrant.       See United States v. Cardona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541733\"><a href=\"/opinion/541733/united-states-v-edward-cardona/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n69 (1st Cir. 1990).         It is immaterial to this Fourth Amendment\n\nanalysis that no parole or probation officer is present when law\n\nenforcement agents enter the parolee's premises to execute the\n\nwarrant.    See id.\n\n            Here, the magistrate judge supportably found that the\n\ndefendant had waived any challenge to the validity of the parole\n\nviolation warrant.        See supra note 1.    On appeal the defendant has\n\nnot attempted to argue that the warrant was issued on the basis of\n\na constitutionally infirm predicate. We must, therefore, treat the\n\nparole violation warrant as valid and enforceable.              Doing so, we\n\nconclude   that    the    warrant   provided   the   officers      with   lawful\n\nauthority to enter the motel room for the purpose of arresting the\n\ndefendant.\n\n            That ends this aspect of the appeal. Because Hudson\n\napplies with equal force in the context of an arrest warrant, the\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fdistrict court did not err in refusing to order suppression based\n\nupon the officers' conceded violation of the knock and announce\n\nrule.\n\n                        B.   Voluntariness.\n\n          Next, the defendant maintains that his statements to the\n\nauthorities should be suppressed because they were obtained in\n\nviolation of his constitutional rights.       He claims that, after\n\nadministering Miranda warnings,3 the officers dangled improper\n\nincentives to secure his cooperation, such as offering to ditch\n\ncertain incriminating evidence — he says that one of the officers\n\nwent so far as to stomp on a glass crack pipe, shattering it while\n\npromising that, in return for cooperation, \"[w]e can forget about\n\nthis stuff\" — and assuring him that cooperation would make it less\n\nlikely that he would be classified as a career offender.\n\n          The magistrate judge, who saw and heard the witnesses at\n\nthe suppression hearing, credited the officers' testimony that,\n\nfrom the outset, the defendant was cooperative, responsive, and\n\nkeenly interested in what they might be able to do to make his lot\n\neasier.   The judge found that no untoward threats or promises had\n\nbeen voiced; the officers merely conveyed to the defendant that\n\nthey \"would discuss with the prosecution the extent to which he had\n\n\n     3\n      The defendant questioned below whether Miranda warnings were\nadministered.   The magistrate judge found as a fact that such\nwarnings had been given in a timely manner.

Given the\n\nfacts as supportably found by the magistrate judge, there is no\n\n\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fprincipled basis for concluding that the defendant's statements\n\nwere involuntary.\n\n                            C.    Sentencing.\n\n          The defendant's sentencing challenge has two facets.\n\nFirst, he argues that the district court incorrectly classified him\n\nas a career offender under USSG §4B1.1 (2004).            Second, he argues\n\nthat the court gave undue weight to the guidelines and failed to\n\nconsider factors warranting a more lenient sentence.              We address\n\nthese arguments separately.\n\n          1.   Career Offender Status.         The sentencing guidelines\n\nprovide in pertinent part that a defendant will be designated a\n\ncareer offender if he \"has at least two prior felony convictions of\n\neither a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\"\n\nUSSG §4B1.1(a)(3).      Here, the defendant insists that the record\n\ncontains no competent proof of his career offender status.                 The\n\ngovernment   counters   that     the    defendant   did   not   preserve   any\n\nchallenge to the adequacy of proof and that, in any event, the\n\nchallenge fails on the merits.          Because the record below reflects\n\nthat the defendant objected on several occasions to his designation\n\nas a career offender, we assume, for argument's sake, that his\n\nadequacy of proof challenge has been preserved for appeal.\n\n          The essential facts are as follows.             At the disposition\n\nhearing, the prosecutor, referring to the presentence investigation\n\nreport (PSI Report), argued that the defendant should be considered\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fa career offender because he had twice been convicted of predicate\n\noffenses (and, thus, had crossed the career offender threshold).\n\nThe prosecutor based this argument on two predicate convictions: a\n\n1986   federal     conviction   and    a   1995     Maine   state   conviction.\n\nAccording to the PSI Report, the federal conviction, which yielded\n\na 10-year prison term, was for possession with intent to distribute\n\ncocaine    and    conspiracy    to    commit      that   offense.     The   state\n\nconviction, which resulted in a sentence of nine years (five\n\nsuspended), was for drug trafficking.                The prosecutor, without\n\nobjection, introduced a certified copy of the state conviction. As\n\nto the federal conviction (which had occurred in the District of\n\nMaine), the prosecutor indicated that, if the court deemed it\n\nnecessary, she could \"go downstairs and get a certified copy.\"                 No\n\none made such a request.\n\n               On appeal, the defendant strives to convince us that the\n\ngovernment's proof of the federal conviction was inadequate under\n\nShepard v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), and that, therefore,\n\nthe \"two predicate convictions\" requirement was not satisfied.                 We\n\nare not persuaded.\n\n               The short of it is that Shepard and its progenitor,\n\nTaylor    v.

See Shepard, 544 U.S. at 16; Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602;\n\nsee generally United States v. Turbides-Leonardo, ___ F.3d ___, ___\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) [No. 05-2374, slip op. at 8-9]; Conteh v. Gonzales,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202370\"><a href=\"/opinion/202370/conteh-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          Here, however, the defendant has offered no coherent\n\nattack on the match between the elements of his prior federal\n\nconviction and the description of \"a controlled substance offense\"\n\nwithin the purview of USSG §4B1.1(a)(3).      Instead, he seems to\n\nconcede, as he must, that possession with intent to distribute\n\ncocaine is unarguably a predicate offense under the career offender\n\nguideline; he argues only that the government failed to produce\n\nevidence of the fact of his federal conviction.\n\n          That argument is jejune.    For one thing, the defendant\n\ndid not object to the recital of the federal conviction in the PSI\n\nReport — and in the absence of any objection, a statement in a\n\npresentence report is sufficient to prove the fact proposed.   See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Arrieta-Buendia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786661\"><a href=\"/opinion/786661/united-states-v-rafael-arrieta-buendia/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 955-56 (8th\n\nCir. 2004) (explaining that, absent an objection, a PSI Report may\n\nbe a permissible source of information about a prior conviction for\n\nsentence-enhancement purposes).    For another thing, the sentencing\n\ncourt had the capacity to take judicial notice of its own records,\n\nsee St. Louis Baptist Temple, Inc. v. FDIC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"369748\"><a href=\"/opinion/369748/ca-79-3511-st-louis-baptist-temple-inc-a-missouri-non-profit/\"><span class=\"volume\">605</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1172\n\n(10th Cir. 1979); Fed. R. Evid. 201, which in this instance would\n\n\n\n\n                               -17-\n\fhave cemented the existence of the earlier federal conviction.              No\n\nmore was exigible.\n\n           2.        Reasonableness.        The defendant's last remaining\n\nplaint is that the district court viewed the available sentencing\n\noptions too grudgingly. He excerpts the following passage from the\n\ndistrict judge's comments at the disposition hearing:\n\n           Mr. Pelletier, when I looked at your file\n           earlier . . . I was tempted to give you the\n           maximum sentence. The reason I'm not going to\n           give you 188 months is because you don't have\n           any history of violence.\n\nAccording to the defendant, the description of 188 months as \"the\n\nmaximum   sentence\"      shows   that   the     district   court   viewed   the\n\nguidelines      as    establishing      a     mandatory    sentencing   range.\n\nRelatedly, the defendant charges that the district court gave\n\ninsufficient consideration to the factors made relevant by 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a), mulling those factors only with respect to fixing\n\na possible sentence somewhere within the guideline range.               Neither\n\nargument withstands scrutiny.\n\n           The Supreme Court's landmark decision in United States v.\n\nBooker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 245 (2005), rendered the guidelines advisory.\n\nIn the aftermath of Booker, we review a district court's sentence\n\nfor reasonableness.       Id. at 261.       That standard of review applies\n\nwhether the actual sentence falls inside or outside the guideline\n\nsentencing range. See Turbides-Leonardo, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fat 12-13]; United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 517 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n            In constructing a sentence under an advisory guidelines\n\nregime, a sentencing court ordinarily should begin by calculating\n\nthe applicable guideline sentencing range; then determine whether\n\nor   not   any   departures   are   in   order;   then   mull   the   factors\n\ndelineated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) as well as any other relevant\n\nconsiderations; and, finally, determine what sentence, whether\n\nwithin, above, or below the guideline sentencing range, appears\n\nappropriate. See United States v. Dixon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202231\"><a href=\"/opinion/202231/united-states-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 203-04 (1st\n\nCir. 2006); Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518-19.\n\n            In this instance, the district court, called upon to\n\nsentence the defendant without the benefit of our clarifying\n\nopinion in Jiménez-Beltre, correctly anticipated this approach.\n\nExcept for his abortive challenge to the court's use of the career\n\noffender provision, previously rejected, the defendant effectively\n\nconcedes the correctness of the calculated guideline sentencing\n\nrange (151-188 months).       By the same token, he raises no question\n\nabout the sentencing court's eschewal of any and all departures.\n\nHis attack, rather, strikes at the third and fourth steps of the\n\nsentencing pavane.     He posits that the sentencing court overvalued\n\nthe impact of the guideline sentencing range and, relatedly, failed\n\nto attach due weight to his advanced age (55), his long struggle\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fwith drug addiction, his poor health, his cooperation with the\n\nauthorities, and the sexual abuse that he endured as a child.\n\n          To begin, the defendant's reliance on the above-quoted\n\nexcerpt from the sentencing transcript is misplaced.        Looking at\n\nthe disposition hearing as a whole, it is perfectly clear that the\n\ndistrict court appreciated the advisory nature of the guidelines\n\nand acted accordingly.    The court's use of the word \"maximum\" was,\n\nat worst, an awkward locution — even that is a stretch — and we\n\nwill not read more into it than the context fairly suggests.       Cf.\n\nLenn v. Portland Sch. Comm., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611562\"><a href=\"/opinion/611562/daniel-lenn-etc-v-portland-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1088 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(disregarding \"infelicitous choice of phrase\" where record as a\n\nwhole made manifest that district court had undertaken proper\n\nanalysis). There is simply no indication that the sentencing court\n\novervalued the guidelines.\n\n          Moving to the allegedly mitigating factors, the defendant\n\nraised each of these considerations at sentencing.        The district\n\ncourt, without rehashing the defendant's importunings, explained\n\nthat it had \"taken into account [the section 3553(a)] factors,\"\n\n\"carefully considered the Sentencing Guideline Range set forth in\n\nthe advisory Sentencing Guidelines,\" and determined that a 151-\n\nmonth sentence was appropriate. In arriving at this determination,\n\nthe court gave significant weight to the defendant's recidivism,\n\nhis   repeated   parole   violations,   his   unexcused   flight   from\n\nsupervision, and the fact that he had committed the offense of\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fconviction while on parole. The court concluded that, in its view,\n\nthe defendant was not \"capable or willing to follow the rules of\n\nsociety, and after having numerous chances . . . a sentence of 151\n\nmonths is entirely appropriate.\"\n\n            In our view, the overall sentence is unimpugnable.         The\n\ndistrict court took into account the mitigating circumstances\n\nraised by the defendant and the factors delineated in section\n\n3553(a), determined that the defendant's persistent reversion to\n\ncriminal activity was inexcusable, and sentenced him at the nadir\n\nof the applicable guideline sentencing range.           Even if the court\n\nwere terse in rejecting the defendant's argument for mitigation,\n\nthat terseness would not have undermined the reasonableness of the\n\nsentence.   See, e.g., Turbides-Leonardo, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op.\n\nat 16] (noting that brevity in sentencing \"is not to be confused\n\nwith inattention\").\n\n            We   add   an   eschatocol    of   sorts.   Post-Booker,   the\n\nsentencing guidelines, though advisory, remain an important datum\n\nin constructing a reasonable sentence.             See United States v.\n\nNavedo-Concepción, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202256\"><a href=\"/opinion/202256/united-states-v-navedo-concepcion/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57, 59 (1st Cir. 2006); Jiménez-\n\nBeltre, 440 F.3d at 518. Consequently, a defendant who attempts to\n\nbrand a within-the-range sentence as unreasonable must carry a\n\nheavy burden.    See Turbides-Leonardo, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at\n\n15]; United States v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202151\"><a href=\"/opinion/202151/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1st Cir. 2006).         Here,\n\nthe sentencing court, which gave a sensible set of reasons for its\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fchoice of sentence, was not required to dwell on why some more\n\nlenient sentence would have been inadequate.       See, e.g., Jiménez-\n\nBeltre,     440   F.3d   at   519   (stating   that,   ordinarily,   the\n\nreasonableness requirement is satisfied when the court offers a\n\n\"plausible explanation\" for the chosen sentence and reaches a\n\n\"defensible overall result\").\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe uphold the judgment below in all particulars.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\f</pre>",
