John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Christopher K. MacLean, with whom Elliot & MacLean, LLP, was\non brief, for appellant.\n     Donald W. Macomber, Assistant Attorney General, with whom\nJanet T. Mills, Attorney General, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 17, 2010\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.               Petitioner David N. Grant was\n\nconvicted of the murder of his mother-in-law after a jury trial in\n\nthe Maine Superior Court.         The Maine Supreme Judicial Court (SJC)\n\naffirmed his conviction, see State v. Grant, 939 A.2d 93 (Me.\n\n2008), and the federal district court denied his petition for writ\n\nof habeas corpus.        Grant appeals from the denial of his petition,\n\ncontending      that    the   SJC's     rejection      of   his   claim   that     law\n\nenforcement officers obtained incriminating statements from him in\n\nviolation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent was an\n\nunreasonable application of clearly established federal law. After\n\ncareful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n             We    summarize      the    facts    as    recounted    by    the    SJC,\n\nsupplementing with additional facts from the record to the extent\n\nthey are consistent with the SJC's account.                  See Lynch v. Ficco,\n\n438 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir. 2006).           We \"must 'accept the state court\n\nfindings   of    fact    unless   [Grant]       convinces     us,   by    clear    and\n\nconvincing evidence, that they are in error.'\"                       Id. (quoting\n\nMcCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d 24, 26 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc)\n\n(citing 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1))). Grant does not contend on appeal\n\nthat the state court's factual findings were in error.\n\n           On the afternoon of November 30, 2004, Grant ingested\n\nabout a half-ounce of cocaine and then drove to the home of his\n\nmother-in-law, Janet Hagerthy, in Farmingdale, Maine. Following an\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fargument, Grant attacked Hagerthy, tied her hands behind her back,\n\nloaded her into his pick-up truck, and dumped her in a field.      Her\n\nbody was found the following day and a later autopsy indicated the\n\ncause of death to be blunt force trauma and blood loss from stab\n\nwounds.\n\n          Around 11:30 p.m. on the night of November 30, law\n\nenforcement officers were dispatched to the scene of a single\n\nvehicle accident, where they found Grant's pick-up truck in a ditch\n\noff the side of the road.     Grant was moving around in the cab of\n\nthe truck, waving a knife and repeatedly plunging it into his\n\nthroat.   The officers shocked Grant several times with a taser to\n\nsubdue him, then wrestled away Grant's knife, handcuffed him, and\n\nremoved him from the truck.   Grant was cuffed and secured to a long\n\nboard and transported by ambulance to Eastern Maine Medical Center,\n\nwhere he had emergency surgery.\n\n          Grant's surgery was completed early on the morning of\n\nDecember 1.   In the hours after his surgery, detectives repeatedly\n\nattempted to interview him.    During the first three attempts, made\n\non the morning of December 1, Grant was not conscious or lucid\n\nenough to make a statement.      The first interview began at 4:26\n\na.m., just after Grant's surgery.       Detectives explained that they\n\nwanted to talk with Grant about his mother-in-law and attempted to\n\nadvise Grant of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436\n\n(1966), but terminated the interview because he was not coherent.\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fDuring   the   second   interview   attempt   at   9:51   a.m.,   another\n\ndetective, David Tripp, explained that he was investigating the\n\nHagerthy case and advised Grant of his Miranda rights.             Grant\n\nresponded that he did not want to talk and his throat was sore.        At\n\n11:45 a.m., Tripp returned and re-read Grant his Miranda rights.\n\nGrant again said that he did not want to talk because his throat\n\nwas sore and indicated that he could not write because his hands\n\nwere sore.\n\n           Detective Tripp returned at 1:42 p.m. that afternoon and\n\nadministered a new set of Miranda warnings. Grant acknowledged his\n\nrights and had the following exchange with Tripp:\n\n           Detective: Okay. Now, having all those rights\n           which I just explained to you in mind, do you\n           wish to answer questions at this time?\n           Grant: No.\n           Detective: What's that?\n           Grant: No.\n           Detective: No?\n           Grant: (inaudible) answer any questions.\n           Detective: What's that?\n           Grant: I don't want to answer any questions.\n           Detective: You don't want to answer any\n           questions?\n           Grant: No.\n\nAt that point, Tripp immediately stopped questioning Grant.         Tripp\n\nproceeded to explain that he was investigating the homicide of\n\nJanet Hagerthy and that he and another detective from the Evidence\n\nResponse Team were going to collect evidence from Grant, including\n\nfingernail clippings, a blood sample, and penile swabs.             Tripp\n\nshowed Grant the warrant authorizing the search and stated, \"So, um\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fif you don't want to talk with me, that's fine.   That's your right,\n\nyou don't have to talk with me.    Um . . . we're gonna go ahead and\n\nprocess the evidence.\"   The detectives then executed a search of\n\nGrant's body, during which they took hand and nail swabs, nail\n\nclippings, pubic hair combings, a penile swab, and a blood sample.\n\n           At 9:03 a.m. the next morning, December 2, after learning\n\nfrom Grant's nurses that he had not been given pain medication\n\nsince the previous afternoon, Tripp attempted another interview of\n\nGrant.   Tripp again advised Grant of his Miranda rights, and Grant\n\nacknowledged his rights and agreed to talk with Tripp.        After\n\nanswering several questions, Grant stated, \"I don't know if I\n\nshould tell you without a lawyer.        I just don't know, David\n\n[Tripp], you know?\"   Tripp responded, \"That's totally up to you.\"\n\nWhen Grant repeated that he did not know, Tripp again explained,\n\n           And you know, that's why I read you the\n           Miranda rights.    Um . . . it . . . it's\n           totally up to you. I'm not going to . . . to\n           tell you that you have to talk to me,\n           obviously, because you don't have to. . . . I\n           will tell you the last paragraph in that says\n           that . . . that you can talk to me and if you\n           decide to stop talking to me at any point,\n           that you can say I don't want to talk anymore.\n           Um . . . you know, so that's . . . that's\n           totally up to you and I want to be very clear\n           on that, David [Grant]. I'm not here twisting\n           your arm or anything.     You know there are\n           certain things that we obviously . . . we\n           obviously know. . . You know that this is what\n           we do for a living.\n\nGrant then continued to answer questions, and during the ensuing\n\ninterrogation he made a number of incriminating statements about\n\n                                  -5-\n\fhis involvement in the killing of his mother-in-law.1       At 9:47\n\na.m., Grant stated, \"I mean I know I've already told you enough to\n\nhang me . . . but I think I'd really like to have a lawyer\n\npresent.\" Tripp promptly terminated the interrogation. Later that\n\nday, Grant was released from the hospital and arrested. Throughout\n\nGrant's hospital stay on December 1 and 2, law enforcement officers\n\nwere stationed in the hallway outside his room.\n\n           On December 29, 2004, a grand jury indicted Grant for\n\nmurder, see Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 201(1)(A).    Prior to\n\ntrial, Grant moved to suppress his statements from the December 2\n\ninterview, contending that he had repeatedly invoked his Miranda\n\nrights on December 1 and that his December 2 statements were\n\nobtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain\n\nsilent.   Following an evidentiary hearing, the motion court denied\n\nhis motion to suppress.   The court concluded that Grant was not in\n\ncustody until after the 1:42 p.m. interview on December 1 when\n\ndetectives executed a search warrant on his body, and further found\n\nthat he did not unequivocally invoke his right to remain silent\n\nduring any of the December 1 interviews.   A jury found Grant guilty\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       For example, Grant admitted that he had gone over to his\nmother-in-law's house after ingesting about a half-ounce of cocaine\nand they had had an argument. Grant then said to Tripp, \"I really\ndon't know what happened. I just totally lost it, I don't know\nwhy. I don't know what I've done. I know it's gotta be pretty\nbad.\" He later stated, \"I knew I was about . . . I knew I exploded\n. . . I don't know what I did, Dave [Tripp], I really don't.\"\n\n                                -6-\n\fof murder and the court sentenced him to a term of seventy years'\n\nimprisonment.\n\n           The SJC affirmed Grant's conviction, holding that the\n\ntrial court did not err in denying Grant's motion to suppress his\n\nDecember 2 statements.      However, the SJC rejected the motion\n\ncourt's reasoning and instead held, following an extensive analysis\n\nof the facts, that Grant was in custody throughout his stay at the\n\nhospital and that he unambiguously invoked his right to remain\n\nsilent during the 1:42 p.m. interview on December 1.2    Grant, 939\n\nA.2d at 103-04.    The court further reasoned that law enforcement\n\nofficers \"scrupulously honored\" Grant's invocation of his right to\n\nremain silent before renewing interrogation the following morning,\n\nand therefore his December 2 statements were properly admitted at\n\ntrial.   Id. at 107 (citing Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96 (1975)).\n\nThe SJC denied Grant's motion for reconsideration.\n\n           Grant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in\n\nfederal district court, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254, on the sole ground\n\nthat his December 2 statements were obtained in violation of his\n\nFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.      The district\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The SJC further concluded that Grant's refusals to answer\nquestions during the 9:51 a.m. and 11:45 a.m. interviews on\nDecember 1 were not unambiguous invocations of his Miranda rights\n\"because he indicated, after being asked, that he did not want to\nanswer questions due to his sore throat and hands.\" Grant, 939\nA.2d at 103 n.6. Grant does not challenge that conclusion here and\ntherefore we do not address it.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fcourt denied relief, but granted a certificate of appealability.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c).             This appeal followed.\n\n                                            II.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n               We review the district court's denial of Grant's habeas\n\npetition de novo.           Abrante v. St. Amand, 595 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir.\n\n2010).    Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n\n1996 (\"AEDPA\"), a federal court may not grant habeas relief as to\n\nclaims adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state\n\ncourt    decision         either   (1)    \"was    contrary   to,   or   involved    an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" or (2) \"was\n\nbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.\" 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d)(1)-(2).           Only the first prong of the AEDPA standard, 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), is at issue here.\n\n               A    state    court       decision   is   \"contrary      to\"     clearly\n\nestablished law if the court \"arrives at a conclusion opposite to\n\nthat reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the\n\nstate court decides a case differently than [the Supreme Court] on\n\na set of materially indistinguishable facts.\"                 Williams v. Taylor,\n\n529     U.S.       362,   413   (2000).          Alternatively,    a    state    court\n\nadjudication involves an \"unreasonable application of\" clearly\n\nestablished law if the court \"identifies the correct governing\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\flegal     principle   from    [the   Supreme   Court's]    decisions        but\n\nunreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's\n\ncase.\"    Id. at 413.    Thus, the \"unreasonable application\" clause\n\n\"reduces to a question of whether the state court's derivation of\n\na case-specific rule from the [Supreme] Court's generally relevant\n\njurisprudence    appears     objectively   reasonable.\"        O'Laughlin   v.\n\nO'Brien, 568 F.3d 287, 299 (1st Cir. 2009) (quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted).      Under this deferential standard, \"'the state\n\ncourt's decision is not vulnerable unless it evinces some increment\n\nof incorrectness beyond mere error.'\"          Abrante, 595 F.3d at 15\n\n(quoting Foxworth v. St. Amand, 570 F.3d 414, 425 (1st Cir. 2009));\n\nsee also Williams, 529 U.S. at 411 (\"[A] federal habeas court may\n\nnot issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its\n\nindependent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied\n\nclearly    established     federal   law   erroneously    or    incorrectly.\n\nRather, that application must also be unreasonable.\").\n\nB. Clearly Established Federal Law\n\n            Grant's   claim    under   AEDPA   relies     on    the   clearly\n\nestablished law of Miranda and Mosley.3         In Miranda, the Supreme\n\nCourt held that once a suspect in custody invokes his right to\n\n\n     3\n      This case involves the question of when the police may renew\ninterrogation after a suspect's invocation of the right to remain\nsilent, not after a suspect's invocation of the right to counsel.\nThus, the Supreme Court's recent decision in Maryland v. Shatzer,\n130 S. Ct. 1213 (2010), addressing the resumption of police\nquestioning after a suspect invokes the right to counsel, is not\nrelevant here.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fremain silent, law enforcement officers must cease interrogating\n\nthe suspect.    384 U.S. at 473-74.     The Court reasoned that at that\n\npoint the suspect \"has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth\n\nAmendment privilege,\" and therefore \"any statement taken after the\n\nperson invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of\n\ncompulsion, subtle or otherwise.        Without the right to cut off\n\nquestioning, the setting of in-custody interrogation operates on\n\nthe individual to overcome free choice in producing a statement\n\nafter the privilege has been once invoked.\"          Id. at 474.\n\n            In Mosley, the Supreme Court addressed a question left\n\nunresolved by Miranda: when, if ever, law enforcement officers can\n\nresume questioning after a suspect has invoked the right to remain\n\nsilent.   The Court rejected a per se ban on further interrogation,\n\nconcluding that such a prohibition \"would transform the Miranda\n\nsafeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to legitimate police\n\ninvestigative activity, and deprive suspects of an opportunity to\n\nmake informed and intelligent assessments of their interests.\"\n\nMosley, 423 U.S. at 102.      Instead, the Court reasoned that the\n\n\"critical   safeguard\"   identified   in   Miranda    was   the   suspect's\n\n\"'right to cut off questioning.'\" Id. at 103 (quoting Miranda, 384\n\nU.S. at 474).      The requirement that law enforcement officers\n\nrespect the suspect's exercise of that right \"counteracts the\n\ncoercive pressures of the custodial setting,\" allowing the suspect\n\nto \"control the time at which questioning occurs, the subjects\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fdiscussed, and the duration of the interrogation.\"             Id. at 104,\n\n103.   Therefore, \"the admissibility of statements obtained after\n\nthe person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under\n\nMiranda   on   whether    his   'right   to   cut   off   questioning'   was\n\n'scrupulously honored.'\"        Id. at 104.\n\n           Applying this general standard, the Mosley Court examined\n\nthe circumstances leading to the defendant's confession and held\n\nthat law enforcement officers \"fully respected\" his right to cut\n\noff questioning.    Id.     The Court found that after the defendant\n\ninvoked his right to remain silent, law enforcement officers\n\n\"immediately ceased the interrogation, resumed questioning only\n\nafter the passage of a significant period of time [more than two\n\nhours] and the provision of a fresh set of warnings, and restricted\n\nthe second interrogation to a crime that had not been a subject of\n\nthe earlier interrogation.\"       Id. at 106.   Thus, this was not a case\n\nin which officers failed to honor the suspect's decision to cut off\n\nquestioning \"either by refusing to discontinue the interrogation\n\nupon request or by persisting in repeated efforts to wear down his\n\nresistance and make him change his mind.\"           Id. at 105-06.\n\nC. Analysis\n\n           Grant primarily contends that the SJC's conclusion that\n\nlaw enforcement officers \"scrupulously honored\" his right to cut\n\noff questioning was an unreasonable application of Miranda and\n\nMosley.   We disagree, concluding that the SJC's application of the\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fgeneral standard announced in Mosley to the particular facts of\n\nGrant's case falls within the broad limits of reasonableness.                      See\n\nYarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 663 (2004) (noting that the\n\nmore general the standard established by the relevant Supreme Court\n\njurisprudence, \"the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in\n\ncase-by-case determinations\").\n\n            The    SJC     thoroughly     analyzed      whether     law   enforcement\n\nofficers scrupulously honored Grant's invocation of his right to\n\nremain     silent,    focusing       on     the    same    considerations        found\n\nsignificant in Mosley.            In particular, the court broke the Mosley\n\nanalysis    into     four    factors,       each   of   which      it   viewed   as   a\n\nnondispositive consideration in the ultimate inquiry of whether\n\nGrant's invocation was scrupulously honored: \"(1) whether police\n\nimmediately cease the interrogation when the defendant invokes the\n\nright to remain silent; (2) whether a significant amount of time\n\npasses before questioning is resumed; (3) whether fresh Miranda\n\nwarnings are provided; and (4) whether the later interrogation is\n\nrestricted to matters distinct from the former.\"                    Grant, 939 A.2d\n\nat 104-105 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            The SJC found that several relevant factors weighed in\n\nfavor of admission of Grant's December 2 statements.                      After Grant\n\ninvoked    his     right     to    remain     silent      during    the   1:42   p.m.\n\ninterrogation on December 1, Detective Tripp immediately ceased\n\nquestioning and did not further pressure Grant to speak. Tripp did\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fnot attempt to resume questioning until the following day, at which\n\ntime he administered a full new set of Miranda warnings.                             A\n\n\"significant period of time,\" over nineteen hours, elapsed between\n\nthe 1:42 p.m. invocation and the resumption of questioning at 9:03\n\na.m. the next day.         See Mosley, 423 U.S. at 106 (finding two hours\n\nto be a \"significant period of time\").                 During this nineteen-hour\n\ninterval, Grant was recovering from injuries but was not given any\n\nadditional     pain      medication,        allaying   concerns     that   medication\n\ninterfered with his ability to clearly evaluate his circumstances.\n\nOn    the   other   hand,       the   SJC    acknowledged    that    the    1:42   p.m.\n\ninterrogation and the 9:03 a.m. interrogation the next day involved\n\nprecisely the same issues, a factor that weighed against admission\n\nof the December 2 statements.\n\n             After examining the circumstances leading to Grant's\n\nincriminating statements, the SJC concluded that \"taken as a whole,\n\nthe    conduct      of    the    police      did   scrupulously      honor    Grant's\n\ninvocation\" of his right to remain silent.                Grant, 939 A.2d at 107.\n\nWe cannot say that the SJC's weighing of the nondispositive factors\n\ndiscussed in Mosley was objectively unreasonable.                          See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Lugo Guerrero, 524 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(holding post-invocation statements admissible under Mosley where\n\nofficers      immediately         stopped      questioning    after        invocation,\n\nconducted second interview nearly four hours later, gave defendant\n\na new set of Miranda warnings, and treated defendant well at all\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\ftimes, even though first and second interviews concerned same\n\ncrime); United States v. Andrade, 135 F.3d 104, 106-07 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (finding post-invocation statements admissible where officer\n\nstopped questioning after defendant indicated unwillingness to\n\nspeak, another officer resumed questioning several hours later\n\nafter asking defendant if he remembered his rights, and there was\n\nno \"undue pressure\" on defendant to talk, but first interview was\n\nrelated to same crime as second).\n\n           Grant contends that the SJC's conclusion was unreasonable\n\nin light of evidence that Tripp \"took steps to undermine Grant's\n\ndecision   to   invoke   his   right   to   remain   silent,\"   a   relevant\n\nconsideration    under   Mosley.       Grant   emphasizes   that    after   he\n\ndeclined to answer questions during the 1:42 p.m. interview, Tripp\n\nexplained that he would be executing a search of Grant's body,\n\nshowed Grant the search warrant, and then executed the search.\n\nGrant also stresses that after he expressed doubts about whether to\n\ncontinue answering questions during the 9:03 a.m. interview, Tripp\n\nresponded, \"I'm not here twisting your arm or anything.             You know\n\nthere are certain things that we obviously . . . we obviously\n\nknow . . . . You know that this is what we do for a living.\"\n\n           However, the SJC expressly concluded that after Grant\n\ninvoked his right to remain silent during the 1:42 p.m. interview,\n\nthe detective promptly ceased the interrogation \"without further\n\nbadgering or pressure to speak.\"        Grant, 939 A.2d at 106.      Viewing\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fTripp's statements and actions in context, we cannot say the SJC\n\nwas unreasonable in concluding that Tripp did not try to wear down\n\nGrant's resistance or pressure him to speak, but instead fully\n\nrespected his invocation of the right to remain silent. Cf. United\n\nStates v. Barone, 968 F.2d 1378, 1384 (1st Cir. 1992) (excluding\n\npost-invocation statements where officers \"repeatedly spoke to\n\n[defendant] for the purpose of changing his mind, failed to provide\n\nnew Miranda warnings, applied pressure by emphasizing the danger he\n\nwould face in Boston if he did not cooperate, and took advantage of\n\na long delay in arraignment\").\n\n           Grant further contends that the SJC's adjudication of his\n\nFifth Amendment claim \"was an unreasonable application of Mosley as\n\ninterpreted by the First Circuit.\"4             He argues that in evaluating\n\nwhether   law     enforcement      officers     \"scrupulously   honored\"   his\n\ninvocation      of   the   right    to    remain   silent,   the   SJC   relied\n\nexclusively on the four factors enumerated in its opinion.               Grant\n\ncontends that the SJC's reliance entirely on these four factors is\n\ninconsistent with First Circuit decisions, which have described the\n\n\n     4\n       We note that the certificate of appealability (COA) granted\nby the district court framed this issue in similar terms. The COA\nwas granted as to two issues:\n\n           1. Whether the Law Court's factor analysis\n           approach was an unreasonable application of\n           Mosley as interpreted by the First Circuit;\n           and,\n           2. Whether the Law Court erred in holding that\n           Mr. Grant's Miranda rights were scrupulously\n           honored by police in accordance with Mosley.\n\n                                         -15-\n\ffactors highlighted in Mosley as part of a \"totality of the\n\ncircumstances\" analysis of whether the defendant's right to cut off\n\nquestioning was scrupulously honored.               See, e.g., Lugo Guerrero,\n\n524 F.3d at 12; United States v. Thongsophaporn, 503 F.3d 51, 57\n\n(1st Cir. 2007); Barone, 968 F.2d at 1384.\n\n            However, this line of argument rests on a mistaken\n\npremise.    The relevant question under AEDPA is not whether the\n\nSJC's decision involved an unreasonable application of Mosley \"as\n\ninterpreted by the First Circuit,\" but whether the SJC unreasonably\n\napplied \"clearly established Federal law, as determined by the\n\nSupreme    Court   of   the   United   States.\"      28   U.S.C.     §   2254(d)(1)\n\n(emphasis    added).      Under   AEDPA,      \"it    is   not   an   unreasonable\n\napplication of clearly established Federal law for a state court to\n\ndecline to apply a specific legal rule that has not been squarely\n\nestablished by\" the Supreme Court. Knowles v. Mirzayance, 129 S.\n\nCt. 1411, 1419 (2009) (quotation marks and citations omitted).5\n\n\n     5\n       Of course, this is not to say that decisions from this and\nother courts cannot inform our analysis under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d)(1). For example, \"[d]ecisions from the lower federal\ncourts may help inform the AEDPA analysis to the extent that they\nstate the clearly established federal law determined by the Supreme\nCourt.\"   Aspen v. Bissonnette, 480 F.3d 571, 574 n.1 (1st Cir.\n2007).   In addition, \"factually similar cases from the lower\nfederal courts may inform\" a determination of whether a state court\ndecision   involves   an  unreasonable   application   of   clearly\nestablished Supreme Court jurisprudence, \"providing a valuable\nreference point when the relevant Supreme Court rule is broad and\napplies to a kaleidoscopic array of fact patterns.\"       Rashad v.\nWalsh, 300 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2002); see also Phoenix v.\nMatesanz, 233 F.3d 77, 83 n.3 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"Although decisions\nissuing from this Court are not 'clearly established' for the\n\n                                       -16-\n\f            We have characterized Mosley as applying a totality of\n\nthe circumstances test to the question of whether the defendant's\n\ninvocation of the right to remain silent was scrupulously honored.\n\nWe think that is a fair reading of Mosley in light of the language\n\nthat introduces the Supreme Court's analysis of the specific facts\n\nrelevant in that case.     There, the Supreme Court stated that \"[a]\n\nreview of the circumstances leading to Mosley's confession reveals\n\nthat his 'right to cut off questioning' was fully respected in this\n\ncase.\"    Mosley, 423 U.S. at 104.          However, the Supreme Court has\n\nnever    expressly   characterized    its    test   as   a   totality   of   the\n\ncircumstances test.     The SJC chose to read Mosley as setting forth\n\na four-factor test, and noted that \"[e]ven after the First Circuit\n\nindicated that examining the totality of the circumstances was\n\nappropriate, we have relied entirely on the identified factors.\"\n\nGrant, 939 A.2d at 105 n.8.     Despite our own reading, we cannot say\n\nthat the SJC's application of Mosley was unreasonable.\n\n            Moreover, Grant has not shown that the SJC's four-factor\n\napproach unreasonably constrained its analysis of the ultimate\n\nquestion under Mosley: whether Grant's right to cut off questioning\n\nwas scrupulously honored. As discussed above, the SJC examined the\n\ncircumstances    leading   up   to   Grant's    incriminating     December     2\n\nstatements, finding that Tripp promptly stopped the interrogation\n\n\npurposes of § 2254(d)(1) because they do not issue from the Supreme\nCourt, they provide significant insight on what constitutes\nreasonableness for a particular fact pattern.\").\n\n                                     -17-\n\fafter Grant's December 1 invocation, did not further badger or\n\npressure   Grant     to   answer   questions,    resumed   questioning   over\n\nnineteen hours later after administering a new set of Miranda\n\nwarnings, and confirmed that Grant had not been given additional\n\nmedication during this interval.              The SJC concluded that these\n\ncircumstances demonstrated that law enforcement officers fully\n\nhonored Grant's invocation.        Grant, 939 A.2d at 107.     Grant argues\n\ngenerally that a four-factor approach \"forecloses any consideration\n\nof the surrounding circumstances,\" but he does not point to any\n\nrelevant factual circumstances that the SJC failed to consider in\n\nits analysis.       Thus, regardless of whether the SJC described its\n\nanalysis as a \"totality of the circumstances\" test or a four-factor\n\ntest,    its    conclusion   was   not   an   unreasonable   application   of\n\nMosley.6\n\n                                     III.\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n               So ordered.\n\n\n\n     6\n       Grant also suggests that the SJC took a purely \"numerical\napproach\" to the Mosley analysis and concluded that \"three out of\nfour factors favoring the state equals scrupulous honoring.\" This\nis not an accurate characterization of the SJC's decision. The SJC\nmade clear that the considerations found significant in Mosley \"are\nconsidered as nondispositive factors that militate in favor of, or\nagainst, a conclusion that a suspect's invocation has been\nscrupulously honored,\" and noted that the substantive analysis was\nthe same even if it was broken into fewer or more than four\nfactors. Grant, 939 A.2d at 105 & n.7.\n\n                                     -18-\n\f",

Mills, Attorney General, was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, LIPEZ and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Petitioner David N. Grant was convicted of the murder of his mother-in-law after a jury trial in the Maine Superior Court. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed his conviction, <i>see </i><i>State v. Grant,</i> 939 A.2d 93 (Me.2008), and the federal district court denied his petition for writ of habeas corpus. Grant appeals from the denial of his petition, contending that the SJC's rejection of his claim that law enforcement officers obtained incriminating statements from him in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We summarize the facts as recounted by the SJC, supplementing with additional facts from the record to the extent they are consistent with the SJC's account. <i>See </i><i>Lynch v. Ficco,</i> 438 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir. 2006). We \"must `accept the state court findings of fact unless [Grant] convinces us, by clear and convincing evidence, that they are in error.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>McCambridge v. Hall,</i> 303 F.3d 24, 26 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1))). Grant does not contend on appeal that the state court's factual findings were in error.</p>\n<p>On the afternoon of November 30, 2004, Grant ingested about a half-ounce of cocaine and then drove to the home of his mother-in-law, Janet Hagerthy, in Farmingdale, Maine. Following an argument, Grant attacked Hagerthy, tied her hands behind her back, loaded her into his pick-up truck, and dumped her in a field. Her body was found the following day and a later autopsy indicated the cause of death to be blunt force trauma and blood loss from stab wounds.</p>\n<p>Around 11:30 p.m. on the night of November 30, law enforcement officers were dispatched to the scene of a single vehicle accident, where they found Grant's pick-up truck in a ditch off the side of the road. Grant was moving around in the cab of the truck, waving a knife and repeatedly plunging it into his throat. The officers shocked Grant several times with a taser to subdue him, then wrestled away Grant's knife, handcuffed him, and removed him from the truck. Grant was cuffed and secured to a long board and transported by ambulance to Eastern Maine Medical Center, where he had emergency surgery.</p>\n<p>Grant's surgery was completed early on the morning of December 1. In the hours after his surgery, detectives repeatedly attempted to interview him. During the first three attempts, made on the morning of December 1, Grant was not conscious or lucid enough to make a statement. The first interview began at 4:26 a.m., just <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> after Grant's surgery. Detectives explained that they wanted to talk with Grant about his mother-in-law and attempted to advise Grant of his rights under <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), but terminated the interview because he was not coherent. During the second interview attempt at 9:51 a.m., another detective, David Tripp, explained that he was investigating the Hagerthy case and advised Grant of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. Grant responded that he did not want to talk and his throat was sore. At 11:45 a.m., Tripp returned and re-read Grant his <i>Miranda</i> rights. Grant again said that he did not want to talk because his throat was sore and indicated that he could not write because his hands were sore.</p>\n<p>Detective Tripp returned at 1:42 p.m. that afternoon and administered a new set of <i>Miranda</i> warnings. Grant acknowledged his rights and had the following exchange with Tripp:</p>\n<blockquote>Detective: Okay. Now, having all those rights which I just explained to you in mind, do you wish to answer questions at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Grant: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Detective: What's that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Grant: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Detective: No?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Grant: (inaudible) answer any questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Detective: What's that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Grant: I don't want to answer any questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Detective: You don't want to answer any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Grant: No.</blockquote>\n<p>At that point, Tripp immediately stopped questioning Grant. Tripp proceeded to explain that he was investigating the homicide of Janet Hagerthy and that he and another detective from the Evidence Response Team were going to collect evidence from Grant, including fingernail clippings, a blood sample, and penile swabs. Tripp showed Grant the warrant authorizing the search and stated, \"So, um if you don't want to talk with me, that's fine. That's your right, you don't have to talk with me. Um ... we're gonna go ahead and process the evidence.\" The detectives then executed a search of Grant's body, during which they took hand and nail swabs, nail clippings, pubic hair combings, a penile swab, and a blood sample.</p>\n<p>At 9:03 a.m. the next morning, December 2, after learning from Grant's nurses that he had not been given pain medication since the previous afternoon, Tripp attempted another interview of Grant. Tripp again advised Grant of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and Grant acknowledged his rights and agreed to talk with Tripp. After answering several questions, Grant stated, \"I don't know if I should tell you without a lawyer. I just don't know, David [Tripp], you know?\" Tripp responded, \"That's totally up to you.\" When Grant repeated that he did not know, Tripp again explained,</p>\n<blockquote>And you know, that's why I read you the <i>Miranda</i> rights. Um ... it ... it's totally up to you. I'm not going to ... to tell you that you have to talk to me, obviously, because you don't have to.... I will tell you the last paragraph in that says that ... that you can talk to me and if you decide to stop talking to me at any point, that you can say I don't want to talk anymore. Um ... you know, so that's ... that's totally up to you and I want to be very clear on that, David [Grant]. I'm not here twisting your arm or anything. You know there are certain things that we obviously ... we obviously know ... You know that this is what we do for a living.</blockquote>\n<p>Grant then continued to answer questions, and during the ensuing interrogation he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> made a number of incriminating statements about his involvement in the killing of his mother-in-law.<sup>[1]</sup> At 9:47 a.m., Grant stated, \"I mean I know I've already told you enough to hang me ... but I think I'd really like to have a lawyer present.\" Tripp promptly terminated the interrogation. Later that day, Grant was released from the hospital and arrested. Throughout Grant's hospital stay on December 1 and 2, law enforcement officers were stationed in the hallway outside his room.</p>\n<p>On December 29, 2004, a grand jury indicted Grant for murder, <i>see</i> Me.Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 201(1)(A). Prior to trial, Grant moved to suppress his statements from the December 2 interview, contending that he had repeatedly invoked his <i>Miranda</i> rights on December 1 and that his December 2 statements were obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Following an evidentiary hearing, the motion court denied his motion to suppress. The court concluded that Grant was not in custody until after the 1:42 p.m. interview on December 1 when detectives executed a search warrant on his body, and further found that he did not unequivocally invoke his right to remain silent during any of the December 1 interviews. A jury found Grant guilty of murder and the court sentenced him to a term of seventy years' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>The SJC affirmed Grant's conviction, holding that the trial court did not err in denying Grant's motion to suppress his December 2 statements. However, the SJC rejected the motion court's reasoning and instead held, following an extensive analysis of the facts, that Grant was in custody throughout his stay at the hospital and that he unambiguously invoked his right to remain silent during the 1:42 p.m. interview on December 1.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 103-04. The court further reasoned that law enforcement officers \"scrupulously honored\" Grant's invocation of his right to remain silent before renewing interrogation the following morning, and therefore his December 2 statements were properly admitted at trial. <i>Id.</i> at 107 (citing <i>Michigan v. Mosley,</i> 423 U.S. 96, 96 S.Ct. 321, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975)). The SJC denied Grant's motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p>Grant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254, on the sole ground that his December 2 statements were obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The district court denied relief, but granted a certificate of appealability. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's denial of Grant's habeas petition de novo. <i>Abrante v. St. Amand,</i> 595 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2010). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), a federal court may not grant habeas <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> relief as to claims adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state court decision either (1) \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" or (2) \"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1)-(2). Only the first prong of the AEDPA standard, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), is at issue here.</p>\n<p>A state court decision is \"contrary to\" clearly established law if the court \"arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme Court] on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Alternatively, a state court adjudication involves an \"unreasonable application of\" clearly established law if the court \"identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme Court's] decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Thus, the \"unreasonable application\" clause \"reduces to a question of whether the state court's derivation of a case-specific rule from the [Supreme] Court's generally relevant jurisprudence appears objectively reasonable.\" <i>O'Laughlin v. O'Brien,</i> 568 F.3d 287, 299 (1st Cir.2009) (quotation marks and citations omitted). Under this deferential standard, \"`the state court's decision is not vulnerable unless it evinces some increment of incorrectness beyond mere error.'\" <i>Abrante,</i> 595 F.3d at 15 (quoting <i>Foxworth v. St. Amand,</i> 570 F.3d 414, 425 (1st Cir.2009)); <i>see also </i><i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495 (\"[A] federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly. Rather, that application must also be unreasonable.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Clearly Established Federal Law</h2>\n<p>Grant's claim under AEDPA relies on the clearly established law of <i>Miranda</i> and <i>Mosley.</i><sup>[3]</sup> In <i>Miranda,</i> the Supreme Court held that once a suspect in custody invokes his right to remain silent, law enforcement officers must cease interrogating the suspect. 384 U.S. at 473-74, 86 S.Ct. 1602. The Court reasoned that at that point the suspect \"has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege,\" and therefore \"any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise. Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody interrogation operates on the individual to overcome free choice in producing a statement after the privilege has been once invoked.\" <i>Id.</i> at 474, 86 S.Ct. 1602.</p>\n<p>In <i>Mosley,</i> the Supreme Court addressed a question left unresolved by <i>Miranda:</i> when, if ever, law enforcement officers can resume questioning after a suspect has invoked the right to remain silent. The Court rejected a per se ban on further interrogation, concluding that such a prohibition \"would transform the Miranda safeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to legitimate police investigative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> activity, and deprive suspects of an opportunity to make informed and intelligent assessments of their interests.\" <i>Mosley,</i> 423 U.S. at 102, 96 S.Ct. 321. Instead, the Court reasoned that the \"critical safeguard\" identified in <i>Miranda</i> was the suspect's \"`right to cut off questioning.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 103, 96 S.Ct. 321 (quoting <i>Miranda,</i> 384 U.S. at 474, 86 S.Ct. 1602). The requirement that law enforcement officers respect the suspect's exercise of that right \"counteracts the coercive pressures of the custodial setting,\" allowing the suspect to \"control the time at which questioning occurs, the subjects discussed, and the duration of the interrogation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 104, 103, 96 S.Ct. 321. Therefore, \"the admissibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under Miranda on whether his `right to cut off questioning' was `scrupulously honored.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 104, 96 S.Ct. 321.</p>\n<p>Applying this general standard, the <i>Mosley</i> Court examined the circumstances leading to the defendant's confession and held that law enforcement officers \"fully respected\" his right to cut off questioning. <i>Id.</i> The Court found that after the defendant invoked his right to remain silent, law enforcement officers \"immediately ceased the interrogation, resumed questioning only after the passage of a significant period of time [more than two hours] and the provision of a fresh set of warnings, and restricted the second interrogation to a crime that had not been a subject of the earlier interrogation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 106, 96 S.Ct. 321. Thus, this was not a case in which officers failed to honor the suspect's decision to cut off questioning \"either by refusing to discontinue the interrogation upon request or by persisting in repeated efforts to wear down his resistance and make him change his mind.\" <i>Id.</i> at 105-06, 96 S.Ct. 321.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Analysis</h2>\n<p>Grant primarily contends that the SJC's conclusion that law enforcement officers \"scrupulously honored\" his right to cut off questioning was an unreasonable application of <i>Miranda</i> and <i>Mosley.</i> We disagree, concluding that the SJC's application of the general standard announced in <i>Mosley</i> to the particular facts of Grant's case falls within the broad limits of reasonableness. <i>See </i><i>Yarborough v. Alvarado,</i> 541 U.S. 652, 663, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004) (noting that the more general the standard established by the relevant Supreme Court jurisprudence, \"the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations\").</p>\n<p>The SJC thoroughly analyzed whether law enforcement officers scrupulously honored Grant's invocation of his right to remain silent, focusing on the same considerations found significant in <i>Mosley.</i> In particular, the court broke the <i>Mosley</i> analysis into four factors, each of which it viewed as a nondispositive consideration in the ultimate inquiry of whether Grant's invocation was scrupulously honored: \"(1) whether police immediately cease the interrogation when the defendant invokes the right to remain silent; (2) whether a significant amount of time passes before questioning is resumed; (3) whether fresh <i>Miranda</i> warnings are provided; and (4) whether the later interrogation is restricted to matters distinct from the former.\" <i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 104-105 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The SJC found that several relevant factors weighed in favor of admission of Grant's December 2 statements. After Grant invoked his right to remain silent during the 1:42 p.m. interrogation on December 1, Detective Tripp immediately ceased questioning and did not further pressure Grant to speak. Tripp did not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> attempt to resume questioning until the following day, at which time he administered a full new set of <i>Miranda</i> warnings. A \"significant period of time,\" over nineteen hours, elapsed between the 1:42 p.m. invocation and the resumption of questioning at 9:03 a.m. the next day. <i>See </i><i>Mosley,</i> 423 U.S. at 106, 96 S.Ct. 321 (finding two hours to be a \"significant period of time\"). During this nineteen-hour interval, Grant was recovering from injuries but was not given any additional pain medication, allaying concerns that medication interfered with his ability to clearly evaluate his circumstances. On the other hand, the SJC acknowledged that the 1:42 p.m. interrogation and the 9:03 a.m. interrogation the next day involved precisely the same issues, a factor that weighed against admission of the December 2 statements.</p>\n<p>After examining the circumstances leading to Grant's incriminating statements, the SJC concluded that \"taken as a whole, the conduct of the police did scrupulously honor Grant's invocation\" of his right to remain silent. <i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 107. We cannot say that the SJC's weighing of the nondispositive factors discussed in <i>Mosley</i> was objectively unreasonable. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Lugo Guerrero,</i> 524 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir. 2008) (holding post-invocation statements admissible under <i>Mosley</i> where officers immediately stopped questioning after invocation, conducted second interview nearly four hours later, gave defendant a new set of <i>Miranda</i> warnings, and treated defendant well at all times, even though first and second interviews concerned same crime); <i>United States v. Andrade,</i> 135 F.3d 104, 106-07 (1st Cir.1998) (finding post-invocation statements admissible where officer stopped questioning after defendant indicated unwillingness to speak, another officer resumed questioning several hours later after asking defendant if he remembered his rights, and there was no \"undue pressure\" on defendant to talk, but first interview was related to same crime as second).</p>\n<p>Grant contends that the SJC's conclusion was unreasonable in light of evidence that Tripp \"took steps to undermine Grant's decision to invoke his right to remain silent,\" a relevant consideration under <i>Mosley.</i> Grant emphasizes that after he declined to answer questions during the 1:42 p.m. interview, Tripp explained that he would be executing a search of Grant's body, showed Grant the search warrant, and then executed the search. Grant also stresses that after he expressed doubts about whether to continue answering questions during the 9:03 a.m. interview, Tripp responded, \"I'm not here twisting your arm or anything. You know there are certain things that we obviously ... we obviously know.... You know that this is what we do for a living.\"</p>\n<p>However, the SJC expressly concluded that after Grant invoked his right to remain silent during the 1:42 p.m. interview, the detective promptly ceased the interrogation \"without further badgering or pressure to speak.\" <i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 106. Viewing Tripp's statements and actions in context, we cannot say the SJC was unreasonable in concluding that Tripp did not try to wear down Grant's resistance or pressure him to speak, but instead fully respected his invocation of the right to remain silent. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Barone,</i> 968 F.2d 1378, 1384 (1st Cir.1992) (excluding post-invocation statements where officers \"repeatedly spoke to [defendant] for the purpose of changing his mind, failed to provide new <i>Miranda</i> warnings, applied pressure by emphasizing the danger he would face in Boston if he did not cooperate, and took advantage of a long delay in arraignment\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> Grant further contends that the SJC's adjudication of his Fifth Amendment claim \"was an unreasonable application of <i>Mosley</i> as interpreted by the First Circuit.\"<sup>[4]</sup> He argues that in evaluating whether law enforcement officers \"scrupulously honored\" his invocation of the right to remain silent, the SJC relied exclusively on the four factors enumerated in its opinion. Grant contends that the SJC's reliance entirely on these four factors is inconsistent with First Circuit decisions, which have described the factors highlighted in <i>Mosley</i> as part of a \"totality of the circumstances\" analysis of whether the defendant's right to cut off questioning was scrupulously honored. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Lugo Guerrero,</i> 524 F.3d at 12; <i>United States v. Thongsophaporn,</i> 503 F.3d 51, 57 (1st Cir. 2007); <i>Barone,</i> 968 F.2d at 1384.</p>\n<p>However, this line of argument rests on a mistaken premise. The relevant question under AEDPA is not whether the SJC's decision involved an unreasonable application of <i>Mosley</i> \"as interpreted by the First Circuit,\" but whether the SJC unreasonably applied \"clearly established Federal law, <i>as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.</i>\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) (emphasis added). Under AEDPA, \"it is not an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law for a state court to decline to apply a specific legal rule that has not been squarely established by\" the Supreme Court. <i>Knowles v. Mirzayance,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1419, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009) (quotation marks and citations omitted).<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>We have characterized <i>Mosley</i> as applying a totality of the circumstances test to the question of whether the defendant's invocation of the right to remain silent was scrupulously honored. We think that is a fair reading of <i>Mosley</i> in light of the language that introduces the Supreme Court's analysis of the specific facts relevant in that case. There, the Supreme Court stated that \"[a] review of the circumstances leading to Mosley's confession reveals that his `right to cut off questioning' was fully respected in this case.\" <i>Mosley,</i> 423 U.S. at 104, 96 S.Ct. 321. However, the Supreme Court has never expressly characterized its test as a totality of the circumstances test. The SJC chose to read <i>Mosley</i> as setting forth a four-factor test, and noted that \"[e]ven <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> after the First Circuit indicated that examining the totality of the circumstances was appropriate, we have relied entirely on the identified factors.\" <i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 105 n. 8. Despite our own reading, we cannot say that the SJC's application of <i>Mosley</i> was unreasonable.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Grant has not shown that the SJC's four-factor approach unreasonably constrained its analysis of the ultimate question under <i>Mosley:</i> whether Grant's right to cut off questioning was scrupulously honored. As discussed above, the SJC examined the circumstances leading up to Grant's incriminating December 2 statements, finding that Tripp promptly stopped the interrogation after Grant's December 1 invocation, did not further badger or pressure Grant to answer questions, resumed questioning over nineteen hours later after administering a new set of <i>Miranda</i> warnings, and confirmed that Grant had not been given additional medication during this interval. The SJC concluded that these circumstances demonstrated that law enforcement officers fully honored Grant's invocation. <i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 107. Grant argues generally that a four-factor approach \"forecloses any consideration of the surrounding circumstances,\" but he does not point to any relevant factual circumstances that the SJC failed to consider in its analysis. Thus, regardless of whether the SJC described its analysis as a \"totality of the circumstances\" test or a four-factor test, its conclusion was not an unreasonable application of <i>Mosley.</i><sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For example, Grant admitted that he had gone over to his mother-in-law's house after ingesting about a half-ounce of cocaine and they had had an argument. Grant then said to Tripp, \"I really don't know what happened. I just totally lost it, I don't know why. I don't know what I've done. I know it's gotta be pretty bad.\" He later stated, \"I knew I was about ... I knew I exploded ... I don't know what I did, Dave [Tripp], I really don't.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The SJC further concluded that Grant's refusals to answer questions during the 9:51 a.m. and 11:45 a.m. interviews on December 1 were not unambiguous invocations of his <i>Miranda</i> rights \"because he indicated, after being asked, that he did not want to answer questions due to his sore throat and hands.\" <i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 103 n. 6. Grant does not challenge that conclusion here and therefore we do not address it.</p>\n<p>[3]  This case involves the question of when the police may renew interrogation after a suspect's invocation of the <i>right to remain silent,</i> not after a suspect's invocation of the <i>right to counsel.</i> Thus, the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Maryland v. Shatzer,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1213, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010), addressing the resumption of police questioning after a suspect invokes the right to counsel, is not relevant here.</p>\n<p>[4]  We note that the certificate of appealability (COA) granted by the district court framed this issue in similar terms. The COA was granted as to two issues:\n</p>\n<p>1. Whether the Law Court's factor analysis approach was an unreasonable application of <i>Mosley</i> as interpreted by the First Circuit; and,</p>\n<p>2. Whether the Law Court erred in holding that Mr. Grant's <i>Miranda</i> rights were scrupulously honored by police in accordance with <i>Mosley.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  Of course, this is not to say that decisions from this and other courts cannot inform our analysis under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). For example, \"[d]ecisions from the lower federal courts may help inform the AEDPA analysis to the extent that they state the clearly established federal law determined by the Supreme Court.\" <i>Aspen v. Bissonnette,</i> 480 F.3d 571, 574 n. 1 (1st Cir.2007). In addition, \"factually similar cases from the lower federal courts may inform\" a determination of whether a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court jurisprudence, \"providing a valuable reference point when the relevant Supreme Court rule is broad and applies to a kaleidoscopic array of fact patterns.\" <i>Rashad v. Walsh,</i> 300 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see also </i><i>Phoenix v. Matesanz,</i> 233 F.3d 77, 83 n. 3 (1st Cir.2000) (\"Although decisions issuing from this Court are not `clearly established' for the purposes of § 2254(d)(1) because they do not issue from the Supreme Court, they provide significant insight on what constitutes reasonableness for a particular fact pattern.\").</p>\n<p>[6]  Grant also suggests that the SJC took a purely \"numerical approach\" to the <i>Mosley</i> analysis and concluded that \"three out of four factors favoring the state equals scrupulous honoring.\" This is not an accurate characterization of the SJC's decision. The SJC made clear that the considerations found significant in <i>Mosley</i> \"are considered as <i>nondispositive</i> factors that militate in favor of, or against, a conclusion that a suspect's invocation has been scrupulously honored,\" and noted that the substantive analysis was the same even if it was broken into fewer or more than four factors. <i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 105 &amp; n. 7.</p>\n\n</div>",

After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We summarize the facts as recounted by the SJC, supplementing with additional facts from the record to the extent they are consistent with the SJC's account. <i>See </i><i>Lynch v.

Grant does not contend on appeal that the state court's factual findings were in error.</p>\n<p>On the afternoon of November 30, 2004, Grant ingested about a half-ounce of cocaine and then drove to the home of his mother-in-law, Janet Hagerthy, in Farmingdale, Maine. Following an argument, Grant attacked Hagerthy, tied her hands behind her back, loaded her into his pick-up truck, and dumped her in a field. Her body was found the following day and a later autopsy indicated the cause of death to be blunt force trauma and blood loss from stab wounds.</p>\n<p>Around 11:30 p.m. on the night of November 30, law enforcement officers were dispatched to the scene of a single vehicle accident, where they found Grant's pick-up truck in a ditch off the side of the road. Grant was moving around in the cab of the truck, waving a knife and repeatedly plunging it into his throat. The officers shocked Grant several times with a taser to subdue him, then wrestled away Grant's knife, handcuffed him, and removed him from the truck. Grant was cuffed and secured to a long board and transported by ambulance to Eastern Maine Medical Center, where he had emergency surgery.</p>\n<p>Grant's surgery was completed early on the morning of December 1. In the hours after his surgery, detectives repeatedly attempted to interview him. During the first three attempts, made on the morning of December 1, Grant was not conscious or lucid enough to make a statement. The first interview began at 4:26 a.m., just <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> after Grant's surgery. Detectives explained that they wanted to talk with Grant about his mother-in-law and attempted to advise Grant of his rights under <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1966), but terminated the interview because he was not coherent. During the second interview attempt at 9:51 a.m., another detective, David Tripp, explained that he was investigating the Hagerthy case and advised Grant of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. Grant responded that he did not want to talk and his throat was sore. At 11:45 a.m., Tripp returned and re-read Grant his <i>Miranda</i> rights. Grant again said that he did not want to talk because his throat was sore and indicated that he could not write because his hands were sore.</p>\n<p>Detective Tripp returned at 1:42 p.m. that afternoon and administered a new set of <i>Miranda</i> warnings. Grant acknowledged his rights and had the following exchange with Tripp:</p>\n<blockquote>Detective: Okay. Now, having all those rights which I just explained to you in mind, do you wish to answer questions at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Grant: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Detective: What's that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Grant: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Detective: No?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Grant: (inaudible) answer any questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Detective: What's that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Grant: I don't want to answer any questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Detective: You don't want to answer any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Grant: No.</blockquote>\n<p>At that point, Tripp immediately stopped questioning Grant. Tripp proceeded to explain that he was investigating the homicide of Janet Hagerthy and that he and another detective from the Evidence Response Team were going to collect evidence from Grant, including fingernail clippings, a blood sample, and penile swabs. Tripp showed Grant the warrant authorizing the search and stated, \"So, um if you don't want to talk with me, that's fine. That's your right, you don't have to talk with me. Um ... we're gonna go ahead and process the evidence.\" The detectives then executed a search of Grant's body, during which they took hand and nail swabs, nail clippings, pubic hair combings, a penile swab, and a blood sample.</p>\n<p>At 9:03 a.m. the next morning, December 2, after learning from Grant's nurses that he had not been given pain medication since the previous afternoon, Tripp attempted another interview of Grant. Tripp again advised Grant of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and Grant acknowledged his rights and agreed to talk with Tripp. After answering several questions, Grant stated, \"I don't know if I should tell you without a lawyer. I just don't know, David [Tripp], you know?\" Tripp responded, \"That's totally up to you.\" When Grant repeated that he did not know, Tripp again explained,</p>\n<blockquote>And you know, that's why I read you the <i>Miranda</i> rights. Um ... it ... it's totally up to you. I'm not going to ... to tell you that you have to talk to me, obviously, because you don't have to.... I will tell you the last paragraph in that says that ... that you can talk to me and if you decide to stop talking to me at any point, that you can say I don't want to talk anymore. Um ... you know, so that's ... that's totally up to you and I want to be very clear on that, David [Grant]. I'm not here twisting your arm or anything. You know there are certain things that we obviously ... we obviously know ... You know that this is what we do for a living.</blockquote>\n<p>Grant then continued to answer questions, and during the ensuing interrogation he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> made a number of incriminating statements about his involvement in the killing of his mother-in-law.<sup>[1]</sup> At 9:47 a.m., Grant stated, \"I mean I know I've already told you enough to hang me ... but I think I'd really like to have a lawyer present.\" Tripp promptly terminated the interrogation. Later that day, Grant was released from the hospital and arrested. Throughout Grant's hospital stay on December 1 and 2, law enforcement officers were stationed in the hallway outside his room.</p>\n<p>On December 29, 2004, a grand jury indicted Grant for murder, <i>see</i> Me.Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 201(1)(A). Prior to trial, Grant moved to suppress his statements from the December 2 interview, contending that he had repeatedly invoked his <i>Miranda</i> rights on December 1 and that his December 2 statements were obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Following an evidentiary hearing, the motion court denied his motion to suppress. The court concluded that Grant was not in custody until after the 1:42 p.m. interview on December 1 when detectives executed a search warrant on his body, and further found that he did not unequivocally invoke his right to remain silent during any of the December 1 interviews. A jury found Grant guilty of murder and the court sentenced him to a term of seventy years' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>The SJC affirmed Grant's conviction, holding that the trial court did not err in denying Grant's motion to suppress his December 2 statements. However, the SJC rejected the motion court's reasoning and instead held, following an extensive analysis of the facts, that Grant was in custody throughout his stay at the hospital and that he unambiguously invoked his right to remain silent during the 1:42 p.m. interview on December 1.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 103-04. The court further reasoned that law enforcement officers \"scrupulously honored\" Grant's invocation of his right to remain silent before renewing interrogation the following morning, and therefore his December 2 statements were properly admitted at trial. <i>Id.</i> at 107 (citing <i>Michigan v.

Clearly Established Federal Law</h2>\n<p>Grant's claim under AEDPA relies on the clearly established law of <i>Miranda</i> and <i>Mosley.</i><sup>[3]</sup> In <i>Miranda,</i> the Supreme Court held that once a suspect in custody invokes his right to remain silent, law enforcement officers must cease interrogating the suspect. 384 U.S. at 473-74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1602</span></a></span>. The Court reasoned that at that point the suspect \"has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege,\" and therefore \"any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise. Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody interrogation operates on the individual to overcome free choice in producing a statement after the privilege has been once invoked.\" <i>Id.</i> at 474, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1602</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <i>Mosley,</i> the Supreme Court addressed a question left unresolved by <i>Miranda:</i> when, if ever, law enforcement officers can resume questioning after a suspect has invoked the right to remain silent. The Court rejected a per se ban on further interrogation, concluding that such a prohibition \"would transform the Miranda safeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to legitimate police investigative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> activity, and deprive suspects of an opportunity to make informed and intelligent assessments of their interests.\" <i>Mosley,</i> 423 U.S. at 102, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109336\"><a href=\"/opinion/109336/michigan-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>. Instead, the Court reasoned that the \"critical safeguard\" identified in <i>Miranda</i> was the suspect's \"`right to cut off questioning.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 103, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109336\"><a href=\"/opinion/109336/michigan-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span> (quoting <i>Miranda,</i> 384 U.S. at 474, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1602</span></a></span>). The requirement that law enforcement officers respect the suspect's exercise of that right \"counteracts the coercive pressures of the custodial setting,\" allowing the suspect to \"control the time at which questioning occurs, the subjects discussed, and the duration of the interrogation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 104, 103, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109336\"><a href=\"/opinion/109336/michigan-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>. Therefore, \"the admissibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under Miranda on whether his `right to cut off questioning' was `scrupulously honored.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 104, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109336\"><a href=\"/opinion/109336/michigan-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Applying this general standard, the <i>Mosley</i> Court examined the circumstances leading to the defendant's confession and held that law enforcement officers \"fully respected\" his right to cut off questioning. <i>Id.</i> The Court found that after the defendant invoked his right to remain silent, law enforcement officers \"immediately ceased the interrogation, resumed questioning only after the passage of a significant period of time [more than two hours] and the provision of a fresh set of warnings, and restricted the second interrogation to a crime that had not been a subject of the earlier interrogation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 106, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109336\"><a href=\"/opinion/109336/michigan-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>. Thus, this was not a case in which officers failed to honor the suspect's decision to cut off questioning \"either by refusing to discontinue the interrogation upon request or by persisting in repeated efforts to wear down his resistance and make him change his mind.\" <i>Id.</i> at 105-06, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109336\"><a href=\"/opinion/109336/michigan-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Analysis</h2>\n<p>Grant primarily contends that the SJC's conclusion that law enforcement officers \"scrupulously honored\" his right to cut off questioning was an unreasonable application of <i>Miranda</i> and <i>Mosley.</i> We disagree, concluding that the SJC's application of the general standard announced in <i>Mosley</i> to the particular facts of Grant's case falls within the broad limits of reasonableness. <i>See </i><i>Yarborough v. Alvarado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134748\"><a href=\"/opinion/134748/yarborough-v-alvarado/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span>, 663, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134748\"><a href=\"/opinion/134748/yarborough-v-alvarado/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2140</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134748\"><a href=\"/opinion/134748/yarborough-v-alvarado/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span> (2004) (noting that the more general the standard established by the relevant Supreme Court jurisprudence, \"the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations\").</p>\n<p>The SJC thoroughly analyzed whether law enforcement officers scrupulously honored Grant's invocation of his right to remain silent, focusing on the same considerations found significant in <i>Mosley.</i> In particular, the court broke the <i>Mosley</i> analysis into four factors, each of which it viewed as a nondispositive consideration in the ultimate inquiry of whether Grant's invocation was scrupulously honored: \"(1) whether police immediately cease the interrogation when the defendant invokes the right to remain silent; (2) whether a significant amount of time passes before questioning is resumed; (3) whether fresh <i>Miranda</i> warnings are provided; and (4) whether the later interrogation is restricted to matters distinct from the former.\" <i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 104-105 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The SJC found that several relevant factors weighed in favor of admission of Grant's December 2 statements. After Grant invoked his right to remain silent during the 1:42 p.m. interrogation on December 1, Detective Tripp immediately ceased questioning and did not further pressure Grant to speak. Tripp did not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> attempt to resume questioning until the following day, at which time he administered a full new set of <i>Miranda</i> warnings. A \"significant period of time,\" over nineteen hours, elapsed between the 1:42 p.m. invocation and the resumption of questioning at 9:03 a.m. the next day. <i>See </i><i>Mosley,</i> 423 U.S. at 106, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109336\"><a href=\"/opinion/109336/michigan-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span> (finding two hours to be a \"significant period of time\"). During this nineteen-hour interval, Grant was recovering from injuries but was not given any additional pain medication, allaying concerns that medication interfered with his ability to clearly evaluate his circumstances. On the other hand, the SJC acknowledged that the 1:42 p.m. interrogation and the 9:03 a.m. interrogation the next day involved precisely the same issues, a factor that weighed against admission of the December 2 statements.</p>\n<p>After examining the circumstances leading to Grant's incriminating statements, the SJC concluded that \"taken as a whole, the conduct of the police did scrupulously honor Grant's invocation\" of his right to remain silent. <i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 107. We cannot say that the SJC's weighing of the nondispositive factors discussed in <i>Mosley</i> was objectively unreasonable. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Lugo Guerrero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203245\"><a href=\"/opinion/203245/united-states-v-lugo-guerrero/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir. 2008) (holding post-invocation statements admissible under <i>Mosley</i> where officers immediately stopped questioning after invocation, conducted second interview nearly four hours later, gave defendant a new set of <i>Miranda</i> warnings, and treated defendant well at all times, even though first and second interviews concerned same crime); <i>United States v. Andrade,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751218\"><a href=\"/opinion/751218/united-states-v-jose-v-andrade-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 106-07 (1st Cir.1998) (finding post-invocation statements admissible where officer stopped questioning after defendant indicated unwillingness to speak, another officer resumed questioning several hours later after asking defendant if he remembered his rights, and there was no \"undue pressure\" on defendant to talk, but first interview was related to same crime as second).</p>\n<p>Grant contends that the SJC's conclusion was unreasonable in light of evidence that Tripp \"took steps to undermine Grant's decision to invoke his right to remain silent,\" a relevant consideration under <i>Mosley.</i> Grant emphasizes that after he declined to answer questions during the 1:42 p.m. interview, Tripp explained that he would be executing a search of Grant's body, showed Grant the search warrant, and then executed the search. Grant also stresses that after he expressed doubts about whether to continue answering questions during the 9:03 a.m. interview, Tripp responded, \"I'm not here twisting your arm or anything. You know there are certain things that we obviously ... we obviously know.... You know that this is what we do for a living.\"</p>\n<p>However, the SJC expressly concluded that after Grant invoked his right to remain silent during the 1:42 p.m. interview, the detective promptly ceased the interrogation \"without further badgering or pressure to speak.\" <i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 106. Viewing Tripp's statements and actions in context, we cannot say the SJC was unreasonable in concluding that Tripp did not try to wear down Grant's resistance or pressure him to speak, but instead fully respected his invocation of the right to remain silent. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Barone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586810\"><a href=\"/opinion/586810/united-states-v-pasquale-g-barone-aka-patsy-aka-anthony-capone/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1378</span></a></span>, 1384 (1st Cir.1992) (excluding post-invocation statements where officers \"repeatedly spoke to [defendant] for the purpose of changing his mind, failed to provide new <i>Miranda</i> warnings, applied pressure by emphasizing the danger he would face in Boston if he did not cooperate, and took advantage of a long delay in arraignment\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> Grant further contends that the SJC's adjudication of his Fifth Amendment claim \"was an unreasonable application of <i>Mosley</i> as interpreted by the First Circuit.\"<sup>[4]</sup> He argues that in evaluating whether law enforcement officers \"scrupulously honored\" his invocation of the right to remain silent, the SJC relied exclusively on the four factors enumerated in its opinion. Grant contends that the SJC's reliance entirely on these four factors is inconsistent with First Circuit decisions, which have described the factors highlighted in <i>Mosley</i> as part of a \"totality of the circumstances\" analysis of whether the defendant's right to cut off questioning was scrupulously honored. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Lugo Guerrero,</i> 524 F.3d at 12; <i>United States v. Thongsophaporn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1219669\"><a href=\"/opinion/1219669/united-states-v-thongsophaporn/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir. 2007); <i>Barone,</i> 968 F.2d at 1384.</p>\n<p>However, this line of argument rests on a mistaken premise. The relevant question under AEDPA is not whether the SJC's decision involved an unreasonable application of <i>Mosley</i> \"as interpreted by the First Circuit,\" but whether the SJC unreasonably applied \"clearly established Federal law, <i>as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.</i>\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) (emphasis added). Under AEDPA, \"it is not an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law for a state court to decline to apply a specific legal rule that has not been squarely established by\" the Supreme Court. <i>Knowles v. Mirzayance,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145897\"><a href=\"/opinion/145897/knowles-v-mirzayance/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1411</span></a></span>, 1419, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145897\"><a href=\"/opinion/145897/knowles-v-mirzayance/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span> (2009) (quotation marks and citations omitted).<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>We have characterized <i>Mosley</i> as applying a totality of the circumstances test to the question of whether the defendant's invocation of the right to remain silent was scrupulously honored. We think that is a fair reading of <i>Mosley</i> in light of the language that introduces the Supreme Court's analysis of the specific facts relevant in that case. There, the Supreme Court stated that \"[a] review of the circumstances leading to Mosley's confession reveals that his `right to cut off questioning' was fully respected in this case.\" <i>Mosley,</i> 423 U.S. at 104, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109336\"><a href=\"/opinion/109336/michigan-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>. However, the Supreme Court has never expressly characterized its test as a totality of the circumstances test. The SJC chose to read <i>Mosley</i> as setting forth a four-factor test, and noted that \"[e]ven <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> after the First Circuit indicated that examining the totality of the circumstances was appropriate, we have relied entirely on the identified factors.\" <i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 105 n. 8. Despite our own reading, we cannot say that the SJC's application of <i>Mosley</i> was unreasonable.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Grant has not shown that the SJC's four-factor approach unreasonably constrained its analysis of the ultimate question under <i>Mosley:</i> whether Grant's right to cut off questioning was scrupulously honored. As discussed above, the SJC examined the circumstances leading up to Grant's incriminating December 2 statements, finding that Tripp promptly stopped the interrogation after Grant's December 1 invocation, did not further badger or pressure Grant to answer questions, resumed questioning over nineteen hours later after administering a new set of <i>Miranda</i> warnings, and confirmed that Grant had not been given additional medication during this interval. The SJC concluded that these circumstances demonstrated that law enforcement officers fully honored Grant's invocation. <i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 107. Grant argues generally that a four-factor approach \"forecloses any consideration of the surrounding circumstances,\" but he does not point to any relevant factual circumstances that the SJC failed to consider in its analysis. Thus, regardless of whether the SJC described its analysis as a \"totality of the circumstances\" test or a four-factor test, its conclusion was not an unreasonable application of <i>Mosley.</i><sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For example, Grant admitted that he had gone over to his mother-in-law's house after ingesting about a half-ounce of cocaine and they had had an argument. Grant then said to Tripp, \"I really don't know what happened. I just totally lost it, I don't know why. I don't know what I've done. I know it's gotta be pretty bad.\" He later stated, \"I knew I was about ... I knew I exploded ... I don't know what I did, Dave [Tripp], I really don't.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The SJC further concluded that Grant's refusals to answer questions during the 9:51 a.m. and 11:45 a.m. interviews on December 1 were not unambiguous invocations of his <i>Miranda</i> rights \"because he indicated, after being asked, that he did not want to answer questions due to his sore throat and hands.\" <i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 103 n. 6. Grant does not challenge that conclusion here and therefore we do not address it.</p>\n<p>[3]  This case involves the question of when the police may renew interrogation after a suspect's invocation of the <i>right to remain silent,</i> not after a suspect's invocation of the <i>right to counsel.</i> Thus, the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Maryland v. Shatzer,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1734/maryland-v-shatzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1213</span></a></span>, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010), addressing the resumption of police questioning after a suspect invokes the right to counsel, is not relevant here.</p>\n<p>[4]  We note that the certificate of appealability (COA) granted by the district court framed this issue in similar terms. The COA was granted as to two issues:\n</p>\n<p>1. Whether the Law Court's factor analysis approach was an unreasonable application of <i>Mosley</i> as interpreted by the First Circuit; and,</p>\n<p>2. Whether the Law Court erred in holding that Mr. Grant's <i>Miranda</i> rights were scrupulously honored by police in accordance with <i>Mosley.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  Of course, this is not to say that decisions from this and other courts cannot inform our analysis under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). For example, \"[d]ecisions from the lower federal courts may help inform the AEDPA analysis to the extent that they state the clearly established federal law determined by the Supreme Court.\" <i>Aspen v. Bissonnette,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202666\"><a href=\"/opinion/202666/aspen-v-bissonette/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 574 n. 1 (1st Cir.2007). In addition, \"factually similar cases from the lower federal courts may inform\" a determination of whether a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court jurisprudence, \"providing a valuable reference point when the relevant Supreme Court rule is broad and applies to a kaleidoscopic array of fact patterns.\" <i>Rashad v. Walsh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200079\"><a href=\"/opinion/200079/rashad-v-walsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see also </i><i>Phoenix v. Matesanz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771201\"><a href=\"/opinion/771201/kenneth-p-phoenix-v-james-matesanz/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 83 n. 3 (1st Cir.2000) (\"Although decisions issuing from this Court are not `clearly established' for the purposes of § 2254(d)(1) because they do not issue from the Supreme Court, they provide significant insight on what constitutes reasonableness for a particular fact pattern.\").</p>\n<p>[6]  Grant also suggests that the SJC took a purely \"numerical approach\" to the <i>Mosley</i> analysis and concluded that \"three out of four factors favoring the state equals scrupulous honoring.\" This is not an accurate characterization of the SJC's decision. The SJC made clear that the considerations found significant in <i>Mosley</i> \"are considered as <i>nondispositive</i> factors that militate in favor of, or against, a conclusion that a suspect's invocation has been scrupulously honored,\" and noted that the substantive analysis was the same even if it was broken into fewer or more than four factors. <i>Grant,</i> 939 A.2d at 105 &amp; n. 7.</p>\n\n</div>",
