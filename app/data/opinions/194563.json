Monga on brief pro se.\n                                    \n   Philip C. Curtis, Peter L. Ebb and Ropes &amp; Gray on brief for\n                                                  \nappellees.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n     Per  Curiam.    The  plaintiffs/appellants,  Dharam  and\n                \n\nShantee Monga, are attorneys representing themselves  pro se.\n\nThey are  appealing an order  of the district  court awarding\n\nthe defendants/appellees  attorneys' fees  and  costs in  the\n\namount of $301,709.56.   The fee award arose from  a multiple\n\ncount complaint  filed by the  Mongas, in  1988, against  the\n\ncondominium trust that manages  the condominium complex where\n\nthe  Mongas are  owner/occupants,  and two  individuals -  an\n\nofficer  of that  trust  and  the  business  manager  of  the\n\ncomplex.   When their case  was called for  trial in February\n\n1992,  the district court  denied their second  request for a\n\ncontinuance  and Mr.  Monga stated  that he  was unready  for\n\ntrial.  The Mongas' complaint was then dismissed for  failure\n\nto prosecute.  Similarly, we dismissed their appeal from that\n\norder of  dismissal, in May  1992, for  want of  prosecution.\n\nMonga v.  Glover Landing Condominium Trust,  No. 92-1288 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir. May 27,  1992).  Thus,  what is  presently before us  is\n\nsolely the  appeal from  the separate, and  subsequent, order\n\nawarding fees and costs to the defendants.\n\n     The  Mongas have  filed an  extensive brief  contending,\n\ninter alia,  that the  defendants' fee petition  is excessive\n\nand inadequately supported and  that the district court order\n\ngranting the petition is too terse to stand upon review.  The\n\nMongas' appellate arguments fail to scale a threshold barrier\n\nof  their  own  making,  however.    Although  they  had  the\n\n                             -2-\n\nopportunity,  they  failed  to  file  any  objection  in  the\n\ndistrict court in response  to the quite-detailed request for\n\nfees and costs.1   All the arguments  vis-a-vis that petition\n\nthat  the Mongas  are now  making on  appeal could  have, and\n\nshould have,  been made  to the district  court.  It  is well\n\nsettled  and oft-repeated  in this  circuit that  \"issues not\n\nraised in the district court may not be raised for the  first\n\ntime  on appeal.\"   Calvary Holdings,  Inc. v.  Chandler, 948\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  59, 64  (1st  Cir. 1991).    To the  point  is Blum  v.\n                                                         \n\nStenson, 465 U.S. 886,  892 n.5 (1984) (a party's  failure to\n       \n\nchallenge  in   the   district   court   the   accuracy   and\n\nreasonableness  of the hours claimed in a fee petition or the\n\nfacts asserted  in the affidavits accompanying  that petition\n\nwaives her right to challenge  on appeal the district court's\n\ndetermination   that   the  number   of   hours   billed  was\n\nreasonable).    See also  Magicsilk  Corp. of  New  Jersey v.\n                                                          \n\nVinson,  924 F.2d  123, 125  (7th Cir.  1991) (by  failing to\n      \n\nraise  any objection  to  the fee  petition  in the  district\n\ncourt,  either prior to or  after the court's  ruling on that\n\npetition, fee target has  waived right to argue the  issue of\n\nfees on appeal).\n\n                    \n\n1.  Contrast Foster v. Mydas Assocs., Inc., 943 F.2d 139 (1st\n                                          \nCir.  1991).   In  Foster,  the  losing plaintiffs  filed  an\n                         \nopposition to the  fee request  and sought  a hearing  (which\nnever materialized) in the district court.  Id. at 141.  They\n                                               \nhad  properly  preserved,  therefore,  a  challenge  to   the\ndistrict court's determination.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     The  Mongas' complaint  concerning the  district court's\n\notherwise unexplicated  endorsement  of the  fee petition  as\n\nreasonable  fees and costs fares no better.  Having failed to\n\nobject to the petition prior to the district court's  action,\n\nthe  Mongas further  failed  to ask  for reconsideration  and\n\nelucidation  from  the district  court  when  it entered  the\n\norder,  the deficiencies  of  which they  presently argue  at\n\nlength.  \"[I]t is black letter law that it is a party's first\n\nobligation  to seek  any relief  that might fairly  have been\n\nthought available in the district court  before seeking it on\n\nappeal.\"   Beaulieu v.  United States I.R.S.,  865 F.2d 1351,\n                                            \n\n1352 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n     While we may dispense with the raise-or-waive rule in an\n\nexceptional  case to  avoid a  gross miscarriage  of justice,\n\nUnited States  v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27,  31 (1st Cir. 1992), we\n                       \n\nfind no  basis for  the exercise  of that  power  here.   The\n\nMongas offer  no persuasive explanation for  their failure to\n\nobject below.  They say that, after the court dismissed their\n\ncase  for  failure  to prosecute,  they  continued settlement\n\nnegotiations2  with the  defendants and  that the  defendants\n\nindicated  that, contingent  upon execution  of a  settlement\n\nagreement,  they  would  withdraw   the  fee  petition.    No\n\nagreement executed by both Mongas was ever reached.\n\n                    \n\n2.  The  defendants dispute  the Mongas'  characterization of\nthe     post-judgment     communications    as     settlement\n\"negotiations.\"\n\n                             -4-\n\n     That the Mongas  were hoping to  resolve this matter  by\n\nagreement  does  not excuse  their  failure  to  object to  a\n\npending fee  petition of which  they were aware.   Throughout\n\nthe four  year odyssey of this litigation,  the Mongas always\n\npromptly  and  aggressively  opposed  motions  filed  by  the\n\ndefendants,  including a  prior  motion  for attorneys'  fees\n\nsought  in connection  with a  discovery dispute  between the\n\nparties.   In the present  instance, at the  very least, they\n\ncould have, and should  have, informed the district court  of\n\nthe ongoing communications and asked for an extension of time\n\nto  respond  to  the petition  or  to  hold  the petition  in\n\nabeyance for a short period of  time.  To the extent that the\n\nMongas'  present explanation  implies that  they were  misled\n\nduring these post-judgment communications into believing that\n\nthey need not object to the fee petition,  nonetheless, there\n\nis  no excuse for their  failure to seek reconsideration from\n\nthe district court after it granted the petition.\n\n     Even  were we to excuse the Mongas' failure to object to\n\nthe  fee  petition,  our  resulting review  of  the  district\n\ncourt's   determination   that   the    defendants'   request\n\nrepresented reasonable  fees and  costs would  necessarily be\n\ncircumscribed  by  the procedural  posture which  the Mongas,\n\nthemselves,  have  effectuated.    The  facts concerning  the\n\nMongas'  conduct   of  this  litigation,   outlined  in   the\n\ndefendants' fee  petition, are  unopposed and, in  any event,\n\n                             -5-\n\nare abundantly supported even by a superficial reading of the\n\nrecord.  We mention but a few here to illustrate:\n\n     (1)  The Mongas resisted discovery until enforced by  an\n     order of compulsion;\n\n     (2)  They moved  to reassign the case  to another judge,\n     which    was   denied;   whereupon    they   moved   for\n     reconsideration, which was also denied;\n\n     (3)  They moved to disqualify defendants' counsel, which\n     was  denied; whereupon  they moved  for reconsideration,\n     which was also denied;\n\n     (4)  When the court granted the Mongas' request of March\n     26, 1991  to continue the trial then scheduled for April\n     1, 1991, they were ordered to pay the expenses of one of\n     the   defendants,  who   had   traveled  to   Boston  in\n     anticipation  of, and  preparation  for,  the April  1st\n     trial date.   Despite  repeated requests for  payment by\n     the defendants  and the  court's denial of  their motion\n     for reconsideration of this  order, those expenses  were\n     not  paid until, in  response to  a motion  for contempt\n     filed  by defendants,  the  court, on  October 8,  1991,\n     issued a further order  directing the Mongas to pay  the\n     expenses by  November 1, 1991  or risk dismissal  of the\n     case; And, finally,\n\n     (5)  when  the  case was  called  for  trial on  Monday,\n     February 3, 1992, Mr. Monga, appearing  alone, requested\n     another continuance,  saying that his wife  was sick and\n     he was not ready to try the case.  None of the dozens of\n     proposed   witnesses  for   the  Mongas   were  present.\n     According to  Mr. Monga, his wife would not be available\n     that  week, but he hoped  she would be  available in the\n     next 30 days.   When the court asked what was wrong with\n     her,  Mr. Monga replied that she was not in the hospital\n     but, \"I  understand that  she is depressed  and she  has\n     some  injury.\"    Although  Mr.  Monga  and  defendants'\n     counsel  had  engaged  in settlement  negotiations  that\n     immediately preceding  weekend, Mr.  Monga  had made  no\n     mention of his wife's illness.\n\n     We  hasten  to  add  that we  are  not  suggesting  that\n\nchallenging discovery  requests by an  opposing party, filing\n\ncertain motions, such as a motion  to reassign the case or to\n\n                             -6-\n\ndisqualify opposing counsel, or  moving to reconsider may not\n\nbe, in ordinary circumstances, appropriate litigation options\n\nor are  filed only  at the  risk of  penalization.   In these\n\ncircumstances, however, we have no cause to review the merits\n\nof any of these motions filed  by the Mongas.  Their  failure\n\nto  prosecute their  appeal from  the order  dismissing their\n\ncomplaint  effectively forecloses  any present  argument that\n\nthe  district court erred  in any of  the underlying rulings.\n\nWe could find no error  in a conclusion by a district  court,\n\nwith its firsthand experience with the parties, that an award\n\nof  attorneys'  fees was  appropriate  under  the sources  of\n\nauthority  propounded   by  the   defendants.    See,   e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nChristiansburg  Garment Co.  v.  EEOC, 434  U.S. 412,  421-22\n                                     \n\n(1978)  (a district  court  can award  fees  to a  prevailing\n\ndefendant  upon  finding  that  the  plaintiff's  action  was\n\nfrivolous, unreasonable, vexatious, or without foundation, or\n\nthat  the plaintiff  continued to  litigate after  it clearly\n\nbecame so)3;  Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 111 S. Ct. 2123,  2133\n                                     \n\n(1991)  (the  assessment of  attorney's  fees  to sanction  a\n\nlitigant  for   bad-faith  conduct,   such  as   delaying  or\n\ndisrupting litigation, is within a court's inherent power).\n\n                    \n\n3.  Christiansburg involved attorney's fees pursuant to Title\n                  \nVII, but the standards for assessing fees under Title VII and\n42  U.S.C.   1988 are  identical.  Hensley  v. Eckerhart, 461\n                                                        \nU.S. 424, 433 n.7 (1983).\n\n                             -7-\n\n     Similarly,  where  the Mongas  failed  to  challenge the\n\ndefendants' affidavit  that  the hourly  rates  charged  were\n\ntheir normal and customary billing  rates or to challenge the\n\nnumber of  hours attested  as  spent on  this litigation,  we\n\nwould  be  hard  pressed to  find  plain  error  or abuse  of\n\ndiscretion  in   a  district  court's  acceptance   of  those\n\nuncontested allegations  as well.  See  McDonald v. McCarthy,\n                                                            \n\n966  F.2d 112, 118-19 (3d Cir. 1992)  (where a party fails to\n\ncontest   the  accuracy  and   reasonableness  of   the  fees\n\nrequested,  it waives  its right  to do  so and  the district\n\ncourt  is not  free to  disregard uncontested  affidavits and\n\nreduce the award requested  unless the order is based  on the\n\ncourt's  personal knowledge  as to the  time expended  on the\n\ncase).\n\n     While  the district court's review is  \"to ensure that a\n\nfee  award, overall, is justified, and that the amount of the\n\naward  comes  within  the  realm  of  reasonableness, broadly\n\ndefined[,]\"  it  is not  \"the court's  job  either to  do the\n\ntarget's  homework  or  to  take  heroic  measures  aimed  at\n\nsalvaging  the target  from the  predictable consequences  of\n\nself-indulgent lassitude.\"  Foley v. Lowell, 948 F.2d 10, 20-\n                                           \n\n21  (1st Cir. 1991).4  The Mongas' present complaint that the\n\n                    \n\n4.  In Foley, supra, at 19,  a case involving public funding,\n                   \nwe  endorsed  the right  of the  district  court to  review a\nprevailing plaintiff's  fee petition  and to award  an amount\nreduced from that sought,  despite a perfunctory objection by\nthe losing  municipality.  Similarly, in  Wojtkowski v. Cade,\n                                                            \n\n                             -8-\n\ndistrict  court's failure  to  articulate the  basis for  the\n\naward  has placed  them  \"at a  considerable disadvantage  to\n\nattack  the reasonableness  of  the award\"  is  disingenuous.\n\nThey had the opportunity to attack the reasonableness of  the\n\naward in the district court  but rebuffed that opportunity by\n\nfailing to object or seek reconsideration.  Their transparent\n\nattempt to deflect  blame for their present position onto the\n\ndistrict court  is unconvincing.  In  these circumstances, we\n\ncannot fault  the district  court's succinct granting  of the\n\nrequest in full as  reasonable fees and costs.   See Richmark\n                                                             \n\nCorp. v.

The  plaintiffs/appellants,  Dharam  and\n                \n\nShantee Monga, are attorneys representing themselves  pro se.\n\nThey are  appealing an order  of the district  court awarding\n\nthe defendants/appellees  attorneys' fees  and  costs in  the\n\namount of $301,709.56.   The fee award arose from  a multiple\n\ncount complaint  filed by the  Mongas, in  1988, against  the\n\ncondominium trust that manages  the condominium complex where\n\nthe  Mongas are  owner/occupants,  and two  individuals -  an\n\nofficer  of that  trust  and  the  business  manager  of  the\n\ncomplex.   When their case  was called for  trial in February\n\n1992,  the district court  denied their second  request for a\n\ncontinuance  and Mr.  Monga stated  that he  was unready  for\n\ntrial.  The Mongas' complaint was then dismissed for  failure\n\nto prosecute.  Similarly, we dismissed their appeal from that\n\norder of  dismissal, in May  1992, for  want of  prosecution.\n\nMonga v.  Glover Landing Condominium Trust,  No. 92-1288 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir. May 27,  1992).  Thus,  what is  presently before us  is\n\nsolely the  appeal from  the separate, and  subsequent, order\n\nawarding fees and costs to the defendants.\n\n     The  Mongas have  filed an  extensive brief  contending,\n\ninter alia,  that the  defendants' fee petition  is excessive\n\nand inadequately supported and  that the district court order\n\ngranting the petition is too terse to stand upon review.  The\n\nMongas' appellate arguments fail to scale a threshold barrier\n\nof  their  own  making,  however.    Although  they  had  the\n\n                             -2-\n\nopportunity,  they  failed  to  file  any  objection  in  the\n\ndistrict court in response  to the quite-detailed request for\n\nfees and costs.1   All the arguments  vis-a-vis that petition\n\nthat  the Mongas  are now  making on  appeal could  have, and\n\nshould have,  been made  to the district  court.  It  is well\n\nsettled  and oft-repeated  in this  circuit that  \"issues not\n\nraised in the district court may not be raised for the  first\n\ntime  on appeal.\"   Calvary Holdings,  Inc. v.

The\n\nMongas offer  no persuasive explanation for  their failure to\n\nobject below.  They say that, after the court dismissed their\n\ncase  for  failure  to prosecute,  they  continued settlement\n\nnegotiations2  with the  defendants and  that the  defendants\n\nindicated  that, contingent  upon execution  of a  settlement\n\nagreement,  they  would  withdraw   the  fee  petition.    No\n\nagreement executed by both Mongas was ever reached.\n\n                    \n\n2.  The  defendants dispute  the Mongas'  characterization of\nthe     post-judgment     communications    as     settlement\n\"negotiations.\"\n\n                             -4-\n\n     That the Mongas  were hoping to  resolve this matter  by\n\nagreement  does  not excuse  their  failure  to  object to  a\n\npending fee  petition of which  they were aware.   Throughout\n\nthe four  year odyssey of this litigation,  the Mongas always\n\npromptly  and  aggressively  opposed  motions  filed  by  the\n\ndefendants,  including a  prior  motion  for attorneys'  fees\n\nsought  in connection  with a  discovery dispute  between the\n\nparties.   In the present  instance, at the  very least, they\n\ncould have, and should  have, informed the district court  of\n\nthe ongoing communications and asked for an extension of time\n\nto  respond  to  the petition  or  to  hold  the petition  in\n\nabeyance for a short period of  time.  To the extent that the\n\nMongas'  present explanation  implies that  they were  misled\n\nduring these post-judgment communications into believing that\n\nthey need not object to the fee petition,  nonetheless, there\n\nis  no excuse for their  failure to seek reconsideration from\n\nthe district court after it granted the petition.\n\n     Even  were we to excuse the Mongas' failure to object to\n\nthe  fee  petition,  our  resulting review  of  the  district\n\ncourt's   determination   that   the    defendants'   request\n\nrepresented reasonable  fees and  costs would  necessarily be\n\ncircumscribed  by  the procedural  posture which  the Mongas,\n\nthemselves,  have  effectuated.    The  facts concerning  the\n\nMongas'  conduct   of  this  litigation,   outlined  in   the\n\ndefendants' fee  petition, are  unopposed and, in  any event,\n\n                             -5-\n\nare abundantly supported even by a superficial reading of the\n\nrecord.  We mention but a few here to illustrate:\n\n     (1)  The Mongas resisted discovery until enforced by  an\n     order of compulsion;\n\n     (2)  They moved  to reassign the case  to another judge,\n     which    was   denied;   whereupon    they   moved   for\n     reconsideration, which was also denied;\n\n     (3)  They moved to disqualify defendants' counsel, which\n     was  denied; whereupon  they moved  for reconsideration,\n     which was also denied;\n\n     (4)  When the court granted the Mongas' request of March\n     26, 1991  to continue the trial then scheduled for April\n     1, 1991, they were ordered to pay the expenses of one of\n     the   defendants,  who   had   traveled  to   Boston  in\n     anticipation  of, and  preparation  for,  the April  1st\n     trial date.   Despite  repeated requests for  payment by\n     the defendants  and the  court's denial of  their motion\n     for reconsideration of this  order, those expenses  were\n     not  paid until, in  response to  a motion  for contempt\n     filed  by defendants,  the  court, on  October 8,  1991,\n     issued a further order  directing the Mongas to pay  the\n     expenses by  November 1, 1991  or risk dismissal  of the\n     case; And, finally,\n\n     (5)  when  the  case was  called  for  trial on  Monday,\n     February 3, 1992, Mr. Monga, appearing  alone, requested\n     another continuance,  saying that his wife  was sick and\n     he was not ready to try the case.  None of the dozens of\n     proposed   witnesses  for   the  Mongas   were  present.\n     According to  Mr. Monga, his wife would not be available\n     that  week, but he hoped  she would be  available in the\n     next 30 days.   When the court asked what was wrong with\n     her,  Mr. Monga replied that she was not in the hospital\n     but, \"I  understand that  she is depressed  and she  has\n     some  injury.\"    Although  Mr.  Monga  and  defendants'\n     counsel  had  engaged  in settlement  negotiations  that\n     immediately preceding  weekend, Mr.  Monga  had made  no\n     mention of his wife's illness.\n\n     We  hasten  to  add  that we  are  not  suggesting  that\n\nchallenging discovery  requests by an  opposing party, filing\n\ncertain motions, such as a motion  to reassign the case or to\n\n                             -6-\n\ndisqualify opposing counsel, or  moving to reconsider may not\n\nbe, in ordinary circumstances, appropriate litigation options\n\nor are  filed only  at the  risk of  penalization.   In these\n\ncircumstances, however, we have no cause to review the merits\n\nof any of these motions filed  by the Mongas.  Their  failure\n\nto  prosecute their  appeal from  the order  dismissing their\n\ncomplaint  effectively forecloses  any present  argument that\n\nthe  district court erred  in any of  the underlying rulings.\n\nWe could find no error  in a conclusion by a district  court,\n\nwith its firsthand experience with the parties, that an award\n\nof  attorneys'  fees was  appropriate  under  the sources  of\n\nauthority  propounded   by  the   defendants.
