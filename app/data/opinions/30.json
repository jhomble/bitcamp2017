O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n                     Boudin, Stahl and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Lynne F. Riley with whom Altman Riley Esher LLP was on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Charles R. Bennett, Jr. with whom Kathleen E. Cross and Hanify\n& King, P.C. were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          March 10, 2010\n\f           BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.       More than 16 years ago, Nicholas\n\nDecoulos   (appellee   in   this    court)      was   appointed   receiver   of\n\nAmerican Bridge Products, Inc., by a Massachusetts state court, and\n\nmore than 13 years ago American Bridge was put into involuntary\n\nbankruptcy.    Most of the issues involved in American Bridge's\n\nreceivership and bankruptcy have been resolved, but a claim endures\n\nby bankruptcy trustee Lynne Riley (now appellant in this court) to\n\nrecover from Decoulos for misfeasance while receiver that damaged\n\nthe American Bridge estate.          That claim is the subject of the\n\npresent appeal.\n\n           In August 1993, American Bridge and its then-owners filed\n\na complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court alleging that a group\n\nof defendants--including Robert Conti, a major investor in American\n\nBridge, and John Conti, Robert's son and a former employee of\n\nAmerican Bridge--had converted and were conspiring to convert\n\nAmerican Bridge's assets to their private benefit in fraud of the\n\ncompany's creditors.     Everett Savings Bank was also charged with\n\nassisting Robert Conti to divert American Bridge's bank assets into\n\naccounts controlled by Conti.\n\n           The next month, the state court appointed Decoulos as\n\nreceiver of American Bridge.         Not long after, American Bridge's\n\nprincipals    and   creditors   began      to    complain   about   Decoulos'\n\nperformance as receiver.           Efforts opposing Decoulos began in\n\nOctober 1993, and included a failed attempt to put the company into\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\ffederal bankruptcy proceedings, fruitless complaints about Decoulos\n\nto state bar authorities, and objections to Decoulos' fee and other\n\napplications, which were nevertheless approved by the state court,\n\nsummarily so in most cases. In July 1995, American Bridge's owners\n\nfiled the first of two unsuccessful motions seeking to remove\n\nDecoulos as receiver.\n\n            In August 1996, the owners and a major creditor of\n\nAmerican Bridge filed an involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition\n\nagainst the company.       When Decoulos resisted, proponents filed an\n\naffidavit that set forth in detail Decoulos' shortcomings as\n\nreceiver.      In October, the federal bankruptcy court granted the\n\nmotion   for    an   involuntary    bankruptcy   and   shortly   thereafter\n\nappointed Joseph Braunstein as bankruptcy trustee.          Control of the\n\nestate passed to him.\n\n            Under the Bankruptcy Code, Decoulos now had an obligation\n\nto account to the federal court as to the property he had held as\n\nreceiver (and which now passed to the trustee).               11 U.S.C. §\n\n543(b)(2) (2006) (accounting requirement); id. § 543(c) (surcharge\n\nauthority); Fed. R. Bankr. P. 6002 (2009).               Without filing an\n\naccounting,     Decoulos   sought   compensation   for    earlier   work   as\n\nreceiver.   Braunstein and several creditors objected and the court\n\nallowed an examination of Decoulos as to the fate of certain\n\nAmerican Bridge assets.       The matter then remained in limbo while\n\nother disputes involving the bankruptcy were resolved.              In March\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f1999, Braunstein resigned as trustee and was replaced in October\n\n1999 by Riley.\n\n          On March 9, 2000, Riley filed an adversary proceeding\n\nagainst Decoulos personally, alleging inter alia negligence and\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty by Decoulos in his capacity as receiver.1\n\nUnder Massachusetts law, these two claims had a three-year statute\n\nof limitations, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (2009); LoCicero v.\n\nLeslie, 948 F. Supp. 10, 12 n.2 (D. Mass. 1996), and Decoulos had\n\nceased to be a receiver in 1996.        Further, Riley's predecessor\n\nBraunstein had investigated possible claims against Decoulos and\n\ndetermined not to pursue them.\n\n          Nevertheless, the bankruptcy court rejected Decoulos'\n\nstatute of limitations objection on the ground that the statute did\n\nnot   start   to   run   until   Decoulos   had   accounted   for   his\n\nadministration and been discharged, and neither had occurred either\n\nin the state court prior to bankruptcy or in the bankruptcy court\n\nthereafter.    In re Am. Bridge Prods., Inc., 328 B.R. 274, 350\n\n(Bankr. D. Mass. 2005).     A trial on Riley's claims, held over 15\n\ndays in 2004, resulted in detailed findings by the bankruptcy judge\n\nthat Decoulos had mismanaged the receivership, and a substantial\n\njudgment was awarded to Riley as trustee.     Id. at 341-50, 356.\n\n\n\n      1\n      Riley also brought a claim for unfair trade practices,\nclaims against Decoulos in his capacity as attorney to the estate,\nclaims against his law firm and claims against other defendants,\nbut none of these are at issue on this appeal.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f          Liability was imposed, with particulars, for               \"fail[ing]\n\nto adhere to the orders issued by the\" state court, \"fail[ing] to\n\ntake possession of [American Bridge]'s assets in a timely manner,\"\n\n\"fail[ing]    to    recognize   and    proceed      with   causes   of   action,\"\n\n\"fail[ing] to act impartially in considering the allegations in\"\n\nAmerican Bridge's Complaint, \"fail[ing] to take steps\" to prevent\n\nthe conversion of American Bridge's assets, and \"fail[ing] to seek,\n\nlet alone obtain, appropriate court orders\" to pursue actions\n\nagainst the defendants in the litigation. In re Am. Bridge Prods.,\n\n328 B.R. at 342.\n\n          The judgment against Decoulos was for the lesser of\n\n$379,173.78    or    the   amount     needed   to    pay   all   creditors    and\n\nadministrative claims of the estate, In re Am. Bridge Prods., 328\n\nB.R. at 356, amended thereafter to add prejudgment interest.                 The\n\ndamages, calculated item by item, comprised waste of inventory and\n\nmaterials under Decoulos' management; diminishment of value of\n\nassets; unremedied diversion to the Contis of debts owed the\n\ncompany; and unremedied loss due to similar diversion by Everett\n\nSavings Bank.       Id. at 349.        The bankruptcy court also ordered\n\nDecoulos to disgorge any fees paid to him while receiver.                 Id. at\n\n349-50.\n\n          On appeal, the district court reversed, ruling that the\n\nMassachusetts statute of limitations ran from the discovery of\n\nDecoulos' actions and barred Riley's claims.                 In re Am. Bridge\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fProds., Inc., 398 B.R. 724, 730-34, 736 (D. Mass. 2009).             Riley now\n\nappeals.       Decoulos defends the district court and, in addition,\n\noffers alternative grounds for sustaining its result.               Our review\n\nof rulings of law is de novo; the bankruptcy court's findings are\n\ntested for clear error.         In re Northwood Props., LLC, 509 F.3d 15,\n\n21 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n               At the threshold, Decoulos claims that the bankruptcy\n\ncourt lacked subject matter jurisdiction, arguing first that under\n\nBarton v. Barbour, 104 U.S. 126, 136 (1881), actions against the\n\nreceiver required the approval of the state court and, second, that\n\nunder the Rooker-Feldman doctrine federal courts cannot review\n\nfinal orders of a state court.         Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263\n\nU.S. 413 (1923); D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462\n\n(1983).        The second argument was raised below, although the first\n\nwas     not;     however,   Barton    v.    Barbour    may   be     viewed   as\n\njurisdictional, Muratore v. Darr, 375 F.3d 140, 146-47 (1st Cir.\n\n2004); but cf. Robinson v. Tr. of N.Y., N.H. & H.R. Co., 60 N.E.2d\n\n593, 599 (Mass. 1945).\n\n               Barton aims to protect the authority of the court that\n\nappointed the receiver and avoid costs and other complications that\n\nwould    arise    from   dual   superintendence   of   the   same    property.\n\nBarton, 104 U.S. at 136-37; In re Linton, 136 F.3d 544, 545 (7th\n\nCir. 1998).       In this case, authority over the estate had passed to\n\nthe federal courts before Riley's claim was filed; the receiver was\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\ftherefore responsible to account to the bankruptcy court, and Riley\n\nhad permission from that court to bring suit.            Thus, the concerns\n\nthat animated Barton were not present.\n\n              As for Rooker-Feldman, the rule applies only when \"the\n\nlosing party in state court filed suit in federal court after the\n\nstate proceedings ended, complaining of an injury caused by the\n\nstate-court judgment and seeking review and rejection of that\n\njudgment.\" Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S.\n\n280, 291 (2005). Whatever limited and implicit attention the state\n\ncourt   may    have   paid   to   charges   of   wrongdoing   when   approving\n\nDecoulos' various applications on largely unrelated topics, no\n\nprior judgment was entered by the state court on the claims that\n\nRiley now pursues.\n\n              Finally, the bankruptcy court had authority to resolve\n\nRiley's claims.       Decoulos had made his own claim in the bankruptcy\n\ncourt for compensation and a compulsory counterclaim appears to\n\nfall within the statutory definition of core proceedings.                  28\n\nU.S.C. § 157(b)(2); In re CBI Holding Co., Inc., 529 F.3d 432, 460\n\n(2d Cir. 2008); In re Am. Bridge Prods., 398 B.R. at 729-30.               We\n\nneed not determine whether, independently, the statutory surcharge\n\npower under 11 U.S.C. § 543 extends to pre-bankruptcy conduct by a\n\nprior custodian. See generally In re Sundance Corp., 149 B.R. 641,\n\n650 (Bankr. E.D. Wash. 1993).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f            On the merits, we agree with Decoulos that but for his\n\nstatus as receiver, the limitations defense would likely succeed.\n\nRiley framed her charge as state causes of action for negligence\n\nand breach of fiduciary duty, and she does not argue they have\n\nbecome federal claims merely because the estate later entered\n\nfederal    bankruptcy.         As    already     noted,      the   Massachusetts\n\nlimitations   period     for   the   state     claims   is   three   years,   and\n\nDecoulos' challenged conduct as receiver occurred more than three\n\nyears before Riley sued.\n\n            Of course, limitations statutes may be tolled where the\n\nwrongful conduct was concealed or difficult to ascertain at the\n\ntime it occurred.    E.g., Koe v. Mercer, 876 N.E.2d 831, 836 (Mass.\n\n2007).    But although Riley contends otherwise, enough was known by\n\nthose who objected to Decoulos' conduct in the state court and by\n\nBraunstein, who conducted his own investigation, to bring an end to\n\nsuch tolling more than three years before Riley's suit.                 We would\n\ndescribe the pertinent facts in detail if the fate of Riley's\n\nappeal depended on this tolling issue, but it does not.\n\n            The bankruptcy court rejected the limitations defense not\n\nbecause of concealment or lack of knowledge but on the ground that\n\nDecoulos had not rendered a final accounting or been discharged in\n\neither state or federal court.         In re Am. Bridge Prods., 328 B.R.\n\nat 350.    In the bankruptcy judge's view, a receiver or bankruptcy\n\ntrustee's liability for misconduct remains open, despite ordinary\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\flimitations rules, until a final accounting and discharge (unless,\n\npresumably,        the    issue    had   been    definitively        determined     by   a\n\ncompetent court before a final accounting).\n\n              Thus, the bankruptcy judge said that \"[a]ny determination\n\nof a receiver's liability, whether personal or official, is not\n\nsubject to a statute of limitations defense in the absence of his\n\ndischarge,\"        328 B.R. at 350, citing to a passage of the treatise\n\nClark    on   Receivers;      the    passage     can    be    read    to   say    that   a\n\nreceiver's liability for misconduct in relation to his duties\n\ncontinues,       despite     the    statute     of   limitations,       until     he   has\n\nfulfilled his duty to account and is discharged.2                     \"Decoulos,\" the\n\njudge pointed out, \"neither received a discharge in [state court]\n\nnor filed a report and account in accordance with Fed. R. Bankr. P.\n\n6002.\"    Id.\n\n              In reversing, the district court said that the treatise\n\nposition, supported only by citation to a 19th-century English\n\ncase,    might     have    been    referring     only    to   actions      against     the\n\nreceiver      in    an    official       capacity      (as    opposed      to    personal\n\ndereliction) and anyway nothing showed that Massachusetts has\n\nadopted the treatise position.              In re Am. Bridge Prods., 398 B.R.\n\n\n     2\n      \"Statute of limitations does not run in favor of receiver.\nThe position of a receiver is one in which liability to account\nwould not easily be barred, and so long as he is living he must be\nheld to have been a trustee of the money received[,] therefore the\ndefense of the statute of limitations is not a bar to a claim\nagainst him.\" Clark, Law of Receivers, § 418, at 705-06 (3d ed.\n1959).\n\n                                           -9-\n\fat 730-32.         The district court thought the position refuted by\n\nMassachusetts cases indicating that where an ordinary trustee\n\nbreaches his duties and repudiates the trust, the limitations\n\nperiod begins to run when a beneficiary has knowledge of the breach\n\nand repudiation.         E.g., Lattuca v. Robsham, 812 N.E.2d 877, 884\n\n(Mass. 2004).\n\n             However, this court In re San Juan Hotel Corp., 847 F.2d\n\n931   (1st    Cir.    1988),    rejected     a   former   bankruptcy   trustee's\n\nargument that \"personal liability actions against a bankruptcy\n\ntrustee can be time-barred before the trustee has presented a final\n\naccount to the bankruptcy court and been discharged.\"               Id. at 939.\n\nInstead,     the     court    held   \"a   trustee   cannot   be   released    from\n\nliability before discharge\" because the purpose of the final\n\naccounting is to ensure that a trustee can be held accountable\n\nafter making full disclosure.             Id. at 939.3\n\n             True, the trustee in San Juan Hotel was already under\n\nfederal authority when he committed his wrongs while Decoulos was\n\na   state    receiver    at    the   time   of   the   wrongs.     Although   the\n\nbankruptcy court had jurisdiction to decide the claims against\n\nDecoulos, facially the claims remained ones arising under state law\n\nand presumptively Riley could not recover if those claims were now\n\n\n\n      3\n      This was one of two alternative grounds adopted in San Juan\nHotel (the other being tolling of the statute until the wrong was\nrevealed).    San Juan Hotel is not binding precedent as to\nMassachusetts law but rather is relevant and useful authority.\n\n                                          -10-\n\fbarred under state limitations rules.    The first assumption seems\n\nfairly secure and the second, if perhaps open to debate, we will\n\nassume arguendo in favor of Decoulos.4\n\n          Claims against a trustee for breach of fiduciary duty are\n\ntypically equitable claims, In re San Juan Hotel Corp., 847 F.2d at\n\n938, but, in Massachusetts, such equitable claims are nevertheless\n\nsubject to statutes of limitation.     Stoneham Five Cents Sav. Bank\n\nv. Johnson, 3 N.E.2d 730, 732 (Mass. 1936) (\"statutes of limitation\n\napply of their own force to suits in equity\"); Farnam v. Brooks, 26\n\nMass. 212, 216 (1830); 6 Smith & Zobel, Massachusetts Practice §\n\n8.17 (2d ed. 2006).   The district judge was correct in saying that\n\nin a suit against an ordinary faithless or incompetent trustee, the\n\nstatute begins to run once the wrongdoing comes to light. O'Connor\n\nv. Redstone, 896 N.E.2d 595, 607-09 (Mass. 2008).\n\n          But   ordinary    trusts     operate   without much court\n\nsupervision and often indefinitely.        Receivers and bankruptcy\n\ntrustees, by contrast, look to wind up an estate, aiming at a\n\nfinal, closing-the-books accounting.     Hess, Bogert & Bogert, The\n\nLaw of Trusts and Trustees § 14, 165-71 (3d ed. 2008); Scott &\n\nFratcher, The Law of Trusts § 16A, 211-12 (4th ed. 1989).   San Juan\n\nHotel treated the rule it propounded not as some peculiarity of\n\n\n     4\n      Occasionally, a federal connection may convert state law\nclaims into ones governed by federal law, Metropolitan Life Ins.\nCo. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 62-67 (1987); Textile Workers Union of\nAm. v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U.S. 448, 456-57 (1957), but the\nconcerns in those cases are different.\n\n                                -11-\n\ffederal law but as a general rule applicable to trustees who are\n\nwinding up estates, and the Clark treatise relied upon by the\n\nbankruptcy judge was not focused on federal law at all.               Absent\n\nMassachusetts case law to the contrary, it is reasonable to assume\n\nthat Massachusetts would follow the same approach in cases where\n\nthe receiver is engaged in winding up an estate.         Cf. Mass. R. Civ.\n\nP.   66(e)    (\"[N]o   order   discharging    a   receiver     from   further\n\nresponsibility will be entered until he has settled his final\n\naccount.\").\n\n             Decoulos argues that the Clark treatise approach entails\n\nliability without limit in time, but filing the required accounting\n\nand obtaining a discharge would trigger limitations protections.\n\nIn re San Juan Hotel Corp., 847 F.2d at 940.            Further, although\n\nlimitations periods have not run, Massachusetts case law allows\n\nlaches to be asserted against equitable claims where undue delay\n\ncombines with prejudice.       Cohen v. Bailly, 165 N.E. 7, 11 (Mass.\n\n1929); W. Broadway Task Force v. Boston Hous. Auth., 608 N.E.2d\n\n713, 716 (Mass. 1993).          So even without a final accounting,\n\nDecoulos was free to show that he had been prejudiced by the delay\n\nin the claims against him; but he did not do so.\n\n             Decoulos does argue that his receivership terminated;\n\nthat he gave an \"oral accounting\" to Braunstein; and that the\n\nbankruptcy court's authority to \"surcharge\" is limited only to\n\nimproper     disbursements.

And an accounting must ordinarily\n\nbe presented for court review, e.g., Fed. R. Bankr. P. 6002; In re\n\nIra    Haupt    &    Co.,    287     F.   Supp.       318,   322-23   (S.D.N.Y.       1968);\n\ndisclosure to a successor may have other consequences but it does\n\nnot prompt a discharge or constitute approval by a court.\n\n               Decoulos says that \"virtually all\" of the conduct for\n\nwhich he was surcharged had been approved by the state court and,\n\nunder settled doctrine governing trustee conduct and under res\n\njudicata       principles,         cannot      be     made   the   basis     for    personal\n\nliability.5         But most of the orders entered by the state court are\n\nunrelated to the actions for which the bankruptcy court surcharged\n\nhim.       Ironically, the bankruptcy court surcharged Decoulos in part\n\nfor actions taken in disregard of or contrary to the orders of the\n\nstate court which Decoulos claims protect him.\n\n               The state court order most closely related to Riley's\n\nclaims      permitted       Decoulos      to    sell     American     Bridge's      personal\n\nproperty       for    $6,000    to    a     company      controlled     by    the   Contis.\n\nDecoulos       argues    this      order     barred      the   bankruptcy      court   from\n\nawarding $29,000 against him for allowing \"the loss and waste of\n\n\n       5\n      \"[A] trustee acting with the explicit approval of a\nbankruptcy court is entitled to absolute immunity\" from personal\nliability as long as trustee has made \"full and frank disclosure to\ncreditors and the court\" and did not \"prevaricate[] or otherwise\nact[] in bad faith.\" In re Mailman Steam Carpet Cleaning Corp.,\n196 F.3d at 8; accord, Kermit Const. Corp. v. Banco Credito y\nAhorro Ponceno, 547 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1976)).\n\n                                               -13-\n\f[American Bridge]'s assets.\" Id. at 343. But the bankruptcy court\n\npremised liability not on misconduct making the sale approved by\n\nthe state court, but on Decoulos' \"failure to secure inventory and\n\nequipment belonging to [American Bridge],\" allowing conversion of\n\n$29,000 in value before the sale.     Id.\n\n          The other state court sale-of-assets order cited by\n\nDecoulos authorized him \"to sell the blueprint machine that is\n\npresently in the possession of John Conti for the sum of Eight\n\nHundred ($800.00) Dollars.\"   The bankruptcy court held Decoulos\n\nliable for the loss in value of $35,000 in equipment acquired in\n\n1990, id. at 285, 344, but the blueprint machine, referred to by\n\nthe bankruptcy court as having been purchased in 1993, id. at 298,\n\ndoes not appear to have been part of this category.\n\n          In re Iannochino, 242 F.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir. 2001), relied\n\non by Decoulos, is not on point.   There, an attorney making a final\n\nfee request from an estate gained approval without objection as to\n\nthe quality of his services and was later sued for malpractice.\n\nThe complaint was deemed barred by claim preclusion on the ground\n\nthat the misconduct could and should have been asserted as a\n\ndefense to the fee award and that allowing the malpractice suit\n\nwould undermine the final judgment by opening up the fee award to\n\ndisgorgement, contrary to claim preclusion doctrine.\n\n          Here, by contrast, objectors to the initial Decoulos fee\n\nrequest did object that Decoulos had been guilty of misconduct--\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fexactly what Iannochino says they should have done; but the state\n\ncourt seems to have ignored the issue and rejected two further\n\nrequests to remove Decoulos with cursory or no explanation.                 Of\n\ncourse, had the state court heard evidence and made findings\n\nvindicating Decoulos, there might be possible claims of issue\n\npreclusion; but the burden of showing such a vindication was upon\n\nDecoulos and he has not even attempted any such showing.6\n\n              Lastly, Decoulos argues that the bankruptcy court was\n\nbarred from imposing liability on him for failing to pursue prompt\n\naction against Everett Savings Bank because, in his last report to\n\nthe   state    court,   Decoulos   reported    the     full   amount   of   the\n\nmisappropriation,       along   with    the   bank's    possible   defenses.\n\nDecoulos' mere reporting of the amount of the claim does not\n\nindicate that the state court approved his failure to pursue it.\n\nIn a nutshell, the state court does not appear to have authorized\n\nor approved the challenged conduct.\n\n              Decoulos does not argue on appeal that the bankruptcy\n\ncourt erred in finding that he breached his duty of care, but does\n\n\n      6\n      The Restatement requires for issue preclusion a showing that\nthe issue was actually litigated and decided on the merits.\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments §§ 27-28 (1982). Massachusetts\nlaw is similar. Alba v. Raytheon Co., 809 N.E.2d 516, 522 (Mass.\n2004) (where not \"strictly essential\" to the judgment, proponent\nmust show adjudication to be \"the product of full litigation and\ncareful decision\" (quoting Green v. Brookline, 757 N.E.2d 731, 735-\n36 (Mass. App. Ct. 2001))). The resolution must also be final, a\nrequirement that Iannochino found satisfied because--unlike\nDecoulos' awards--the disposition ended the attorney's service.\nIannochino, 242 F.3d at 45.\n\n                                       -15-\n\fargue in closing that the evidence does not support the finding\n\nthat his actions or inactions caused the damages assessed.                     We\n\nreview the bankruptcy court's causation finding for clear error,\n\nClement v.

Riley with whom Altman Riley Esher LLP was on brief for appellant.</p>\n<p>Charles R. Bennett, Jr. with whom Kathleen E. Cross and Hanify &amp; King, P.C. were on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, STAHL and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>More than 16 years ago, Nicholas Decoulos (appellee in this court) was appointed receiver of American Bridge Products, Inc., by a Massachusetts state court, and more than 13 years ago American Bridge was put into involuntary bankruptcy. Most of the issues involved in American Bridge's receivership and bankruptcy have been resolved, but a claim endures by bankruptcy trustee Lynne Riley (now appellant in this court) to recover from Decoulos for misfeasance while receiver that damaged the American Bridge estate. That claim is the subject of the present appeal.</p>\n<p>In August 1993, American Bridge and its then-owners filed a complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court alleging that a group of defendantsincluding Robert Conti, a major investor in American Bridge, and John Conti, Robert's son and a former employee of American Bridge had converted and were conspiring to convert American Bridge's assets to their private benefit in fraud of the company's creditors. Everett Savings Bank was also charged with assisting Robert Conti to divert American Bridge's bank assets into accounts controlled by Conti.</p>\n<p>The next month, the state court appointed Decoulos as receiver of American Bridge. Not long after, American Bridge's principals and creditors began to complain about Decoulos' performance as receiver. Efforts opposing Decoulos began in October 1993, and included a failed attempt to put the company into federal bankruptcy proceedings, fruitless complaints about Decoulos to state bar authorities, and objections to Decoulos' fee and other applications, which were nevertheless approved by the state court, summarily so in most cases. In July 1995, American Bridge's owners filed the first of two unsuccessful motions seeking to remove Decoulos as receiver.</p>\n<p>In August 1996, the owners and a major creditor of American Bridge filed an involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition against the company. When Decoulos resisted, proponents filed an affidavit that set forth in detail Decoulos' shortcomings as receiver. In October, the federal bankruptcy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> court granted the motion for an involuntary bankruptcy and shortly thereafter appointed Joseph Braunstein as bankruptcy trustee. Control of the estate passed to him.</p>\n<p>Under the Bankruptcy Code, Decoulos now had an obligation to account to the federal court as to the property he had held as receiver (and which now passed to the trustee). 11 U.S.C. § 543(b)(2) (2006) (accounting requirement); <i>id.</i> § 543(c) (surcharge authority); Fed. R. Bankr.P. 6002 (2009). Without filing an accounting, Decoulos sought compensation for earlier work as receiver. Braunstein and several creditors objected and the court allowed an examination of Decoulos as to the fate of certain American Bridge assets. The matter then remained in limbo while other disputes involving the bankruptcy were resolved. In March 1999, Braunstein resigned as trustee and was replaced in October 1999 by Riley.</p>\n<p>On March 9, 2000, Riley filed an adversary proceeding against Decoulos personally, alleging <i>inter alia</i> negligence and breach of fiduciary duty by Decoulos in his capacity as receiver.<sup>[1]</sup> Under Massachusetts law, these two claims had a three-year statute of limitations, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (2009); <i>LoCicero v. Leslie,</i> 948 F.Supp. 10, 12 n. 2 (D.Mass. 1996), and Decoulos had ceased to be a receiver in 1996. Further, Riley's predecessor Braunstein had investigated possible claims against Decoulos and determined not to pursue them.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the bankruptcy court rejected Decoulos' statute of limitations objection on the ground that the statute did not start to run until Decoulos had accounted for his administration and been discharged, and neither had occurred either in the state court prior to bankruptcy or in the bankruptcy court thereafter. <i>In re Am. Bridge Prods., Inc.,</i> 328 B.R. 274, 350 (Bankr.D.Mass.2005). A trial on Riley's claims, held over 15 days in 2004, resulted in detailed findings by the bankruptcy judge that Decoulos had mismanaged the receivership, and a substantial judgment was awarded to Riley as trustee. <i>Id.</i> at 341-50, 356.</p>\n<p>Liability was imposed, with particulars, for \"fail[ing] to adhere to the orders issued by the\" state court, \"fail[ing] to take possession of [American Bridge]'s assets in a timely manner,\" \"fail[ing] to recognize and proceed with causes of action,\" \"fail[ing] to act impartially in considering the allegations in\" American Bridge's Complaint, \"fail[ing] to take steps\" to prevent the conversion of American Bridge's assets, and \"fail[ing] to seek, let alone obtain, appropriate court orders\" to pursue actions against the defendants in the litigation. <i>In re Am. Bridge Prods.,</i> 328 B.R. at 342.</p>\n<p>The judgment against Decoulos was for the lesser of $379,173.78 or the amount needed to pay all creditors and administrative claims of the estate, <i>In re Am. Bridge Prods.,</i> 328 B.R. at 356, amended thereafter to add prejudgment interest. The damages, calculated item by item, comprised waste of inventory and materials under Decoulos' management; diminishment of value of assets; unremedied diversion to the Contis of debts owed the company; and unremedied loss due to similar diversion by Everett Savings Bank. <i>Id.</i> at 349. The bankruptcy court also ordered Decoulos to disgorge any fees paid to him while receiver. <i>Id.</i> at 349-50.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> On appeal, the district court reversed, ruling that the Massachusetts statute of limitations ran from the discovery of Decoulos' actions and barred Riley's claims. <i>In re Am. Bridge Prods., Inc.,</i> 398 B.R. 724, 730-34, 736 (D.Mass.2009). Riley now appeals. Decoulos defends the district court and, in addition, offers alternative grounds for sustaining its result. Our review of rulings of law is de novo; the bankruptcy court's findings are tested for clear error. <i>In re Northwood Props., LLC,</i> 509 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>At the threshold, Decoulos claims that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, arguing first that under <i>Barton v. Barbour,</i> 104 U.S. 126, 136, 26 L.Ed. 672 (1881), actions against the receiver required the approval of the state court and, second, that under the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine federal courts cannot review final orders of a state court. <i>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co.,</i> 263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <i>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman,</i> 460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). The second argument was raised below, although the first was not; however, <i>Barton v. Barbour</i> may be viewed as jurisdictional, <i>Muratore v. Darr,</i> 375 F.3d 140, 146-47 (1st Cir.2004); <i>but cf. </i><i>Robinson v. Tr. of N.Y., N.H. &amp; H.R. Co.,</i> 318 Mass. 121, 60 N.E.2d 593, 599 (1945).</p>\n<p><i>Barton</i> aims to protect the authority of the court that appointed the receiver and avoid costs and other complications that would arise from dual superintendence of the same property. <i>Barton,</i> 104 U.S. at 136-37; <i>In re Linton,</i> 136 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir.1998). In this case, authority over the estate had passed to the federal courts before Riley's claim was filed; the receiver was therefore responsible to account to the bankruptcy court, and Riley had permission from that court to bring suit. Thus, the concerns that animated <i>Barton</i> were not present.</p>\n<p>As for <i>Rooker-Feldman,</i> the rule applies only when \"the losing party in state court filed suit in federal court after the state proceedings ended, complaining of an injury caused by the state-court judgment and seeking review and rejection of that judgment.\" <i>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp.,</i> 544 U.S. 280, 291, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). Whatever limited and implicit attention the state court may have paid to charges of wrongdoing when approving Decoulos' various applications on largely unrelated topics, no prior judgment was entered by the state court on the claims that Riley now pursues.</p>\n<p>Finally, the bankruptcy court had authority to resolve Riley's claims. Decoulos had made his own claim in the bankruptcy court for compensation and a compulsory counterclaim appears to fall within the statutory definition of core proceedings. 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2); <i>In re CBI Holding Co., Inc.,</i> 529 F.3d 432, 460 (2d Cir.2008); <i>In re Am. Bridge Prods.,</i> 398 B.R. at 729-30. We need not determine whether, independently, the statutory surcharge power under 11 U.S.C. § 543 extends to pre-bankruptcy conduct by a prior custodian. <i>See generally </i><i>In re Sundance Corp.,</i> 149 B.R. 641, 650 (Bankr. E.D.Wash.1993).</p>\n<p>On the merits, we agree with Decoulos that but for his status as receiver, the limitations defense would likely succeed. Riley framed her charge as state causes of action for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty, and she does not argue they have become federal claims merely because the estate later entered federal bankruptcy. As already noted, the Massachusetts limitations period for the state claims is three years, and Decoulos' challenged conduct as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> receiver occurred more than three years before Riley sued.</p>\n<p>Of course, limitations statutes may be tolled where the wrongful conduct was concealed or difficult to ascertain at the time it occurred. <i>E.g., </i><i>Koe v. Mercer,</i> 450 Mass. 97, 876 N.E.2d 831, 836 (2007). But although Riley contends otherwise, enough was known by those who objected to Decoulos' conduct in the state court and by Braunstein, who conducted his own investigation, to bring an end to such tolling more than three years before Riley's suit. We would describe the pertinent facts in detail if the fate of Riley's appeal depended on this tolling issue, but it does not.</p>\n<p>The bankruptcy court rejected the limitations defense not because of concealment or lack of knowledge but on the ground that Decoulos had not rendered a final accounting or been discharged in either state or federal court. <i>In re Am. Bridge Prods.,</i> 328 B.R. at 350. In the bankruptcy judge's view, a receiver or bankruptcy trustee's liability for misconduct remains open, despite ordinary limitations rules, until a final accounting and discharge (unless, presumably, the issue had been definitively determined by a competent court before a final accounting).</p>\n<p>Thus, the bankruptcy judge said that \"[a]ny determination of a receiver's liability, whether personal or official, is not subject to a statute of limitations defense in the absence of his discharge,\" 328 B.R. at 350, citing to a passage of the treatise <i>Clark on Receivers</i>; the passage can be read to say that a receiver's liability for misconduct in relation to his duties continues, despite the statute of limitations, until he has fulfilled his duty to account and is discharged.<sup>[2]</sup> \"Decoulos,\" the judge pointed out, \"neither received a discharge in [state court] nor filed a report and account in accordance with Fed. R. Bankr.P. 6002.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In reversing, the district court said that the treatise position, supported only by citation to a 19th-century English case, might have been referring only to actions against the receiver in an official capacity (as opposed to personal dereliction) and anyway nothing showed that Massachusetts has adopted the treatise position. <i>In re Am. Bridge Prods.,</i> 398 B.R. at 730-32. The district court thought the position refuted by Massachusetts cases indicating that where an ordinary trustee breaches his duties and repudiates the trust, the limitations period begins to run when a beneficiary has knowledge of the breach and repudiation. <i>E.g., </i><i>Lattuca v. Robsham,</i> 442 Mass. 205, 812 N.E.2d 877, 884 (2004).</p>\n<p>However, this court <i>In re San Juan Hotel Corp.,</i> 847 F.2d 931 (1st Cir.1988), rejected a former bankruptcy trustee's argument that \"personal liability actions against a bankruptcy trustee can be time-barred before the trustee has presented a final account to the bankruptcy court and been discharged.\" <i>Id.</i> at 939. Instead, the court held \"a trustee cannot be released from liability before discharge\" because the purpose of the final accounting is to ensure that a trustee can be held accountable after making full disclosure. <i>Id.</i> at 939.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> True, the trustee in <i>San Juan Hotel</i> was already under federal authority when he committed his wrongs while Decoulos was a state receiver at the time of the wrongs. Although the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to decide the claims against Decoulos, facially the claims remained ones arising under state law and presumptively Riley could not recover if those claims were now barred under state limitations rules. The first assumption seems fairly secure and the second, if perhaps open to debate, we will assume <i>arguendo</i> in favor of Decoulos.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Claims against a trustee for breach of fiduciary duty are typically equitable claims, <i>In re San Juan Hotel Corp.,</i> 847 F.2d at 938, but, in Massachusetts, such equitable claims are nevertheless subject to statutes of limitation. <i>Stoneham Five Cents Sav. Bank v. Johnson,</i> 295 Mass. 390, 3 N.E.2d 730, 732 (1936) (\"statutes of limitation apply of their own force to suits in equity\"); <i>Farnam v. Brooks,</i> 26 Mass. 212, 216 (1830); 6 Smith &amp; Zobel, <i>Massachusetts Practice</i> § 8.17 (2d ed.2006). The district judge was correct in saying that in a suit against an ordinary faithless or incompetent trustee, the statute begins to run once the wrongdoing comes to light. <i>O'Connor v. Redstone,</i> 452 Mass. 537, 896 N.E.2d 595, 607-09 (2008).</p>\n<p>But ordinary trusts operate without much court supervision and often indefinitely. Receivers and bankruptcy trustees, by contrast, look to wind up an estate, aiming at a final, closing-the-books accounting. Hess, Bogert &amp; Bogert, <i>The Law of Trusts and Trustees</i> § 14, 165-71 (3d ed.2008); Scott &amp; Fratcher, <i>The Law of Trusts</i> § 16A, 211-12 (4th ed.1989). <i>San Juan Hotel</i> treated the rule it propounded not as some peculiarity of federal law but as a general rule applicable to trustees who are winding up estates, and the Clark treatise relied upon by the bankruptcy judge was not focused on federal law at all. Absent Massachusetts case law to the contrary, it is reasonable to assume that Massachusetts would follow the same approach in cases where the receiver is engaged in winding up an estate. <i>Cf.</i> Mass. R. Civ. P. 66(e) (\"[N]o order discharging a receiver from further responsibility will be entered until he has settled his final account.\").</p>\n<p>Decoulos argues that the Clark treatise approach entails liability without limit in time, but filing the required accounting and obtaining a discharge would trigger limitations protections. <i>In re San Juan Hotel Corp.,</i> 847 F.2d at 940. Further, although limitations periods have not run, Massachusetts case law allows laches to be asserted against equitable claims where undue delay combines with prejudice. <i>Cohen v. Bailly,</i> 266 Mass. 39, 165 N.E. 7, 11 (1929); <i>W. Broadway Task Force v. Boston Hous. Auth.,</i> 414 Mass. 394, 608 N.E.2d 713, 716 (1993). So even without a final accounting, Decoulos was free to show that he had been prejudiced by the delay in the claims against him; but he did not do so.</p>\n<p>Decoulos does argue that his receivership terminated; that he gave an \"oral accounting\" to Braunstein; and that the bankruptcy court's authority to \"surcharge\" is limited only to improper disbursements. But termination neither extinguishes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> liabilities nor under <i>San Juan Hotel</i> and the Clark treatise starts the limitations period running. And an accounting must ordinarily be presented for <i>court</i> review, <i>e.g.,</i> Fed. R. Bankr.P. 6002; <i>In re Ira Haupt &amp; Co.,</i> 287 F.Supp. 318, 322-23 (S.D.N.Y.1968); disclosure to a successor may have other consequences but it does not prompt a discharge or constitute approval by a court.</p>\n<p>Decoulos says that \"virtually all\" of the conduct for which he was surcharged had been approved by the state court and, under settled doctrine governing trustee conduct and under res judicata principles, cannot be made the basis for personal liability.<sup>[5]</sup> But most of the orders entered by the state court are unrelated to the actions for which the bankruptcy court surcharged him. Ironically, the bankruptcy court surcharged Decoulos in part for actions taken in disregard of or contrary to the orders of the state court which Decoulos claims protect him.</p>\n<p>The state court order most closely related to Riley's claims permitted Decoulos to sell American Bridge's personal property for $6,000 to a company controlled by the Contis. Decoulos argues this order barred the bankruptcy court from awarding $29,000 against him for allowing \"the loss and waste of [American Bridge]'s assets.\" <i>Id.</i> at 343. But the bankruptcy court premised liability not on misconduct making the sale approved by the state court, but on Decoulos' \"'failure to secure inventory and equipment belonging to [American Bridge],\" allowing conversion of $29,000 in value <i>before</i> the sale. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The other state court sale-of-assets order cited by Decoulos authorized him \"to sell the blueprint machine that is presently in the possession of John Conti for the sum of Eight Hundred ($800.00) Dollars.\" The bankruptcy court held Decoulos liable for the loss in value of $35,000 in equipment acquired in 1990, <i>id.</i> at 285, 344, but the blueprint machine, referred to by the bankruptcy court as having been purchased in 1993, <i>id.</i> at 298, does not appear to have been part of this category.</p>\n<p><i>In re Iannochino,</i> 242 F.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir.2001), relied on by Decoulos, is not on point. There, an attorney making a final fee request from an estate gained approval without objection as to the quality of his services and was later sued for malpractice. The complaint was deemed barred by claim preclusion on the ground that the misconduct could and should have been asserted as a defense to the fee award and that allowing the malpractice suit would undermine the final judgment by opening up the fee award to disgorgement, contrary to claim preclusion doctrine.</p>\n<p>Here, by contrast, objectors to the initial Decoulos fee request did object that Decoulos had been guilty of misconduct exactly what <i>Iannochino</i> says they should have done; but the state court seems to have ignored the issue and rejected two further requests to remove Decoulos with cursory or no explanation. Of course, had the state court heard evidence and made findings vindicating Decoulos, there might be possible claims of issue preclusion; but the burden of showing such a vindication was upon Decoulos and he has not even attempted any such showing.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> Lastly, Decoulos argues that the bankruptcy court was barred from imposing liability on him for failing to pursue prompt action against Everett Savings Bank because, in his last report to the state court, Decoulos reported the full amount of the misappropriation, along with the bank's possible defenses. Decoulos' mere reporting of the amount of the claim does not indicate that the state court approved his failure to pursue it. In a nutshell, the state court does not appear to have authorized or approved the challenged conduct.</p>\n<p>Decoulos does not argue on appeal that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that he breached his duty of care, but does argue in closing that the evidence does not support the finding that his actions or inactions caused the damages assessed.

Riley with whom Altman Riley Esher LLP was on brief for appellant.</p>\n<p>Charles R. Bennett, Jr. with whom Kathleen E. Cross and Hanify &amp; King, P.C. were on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, STAHL and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>More than 16 years ago, Nicholas Decoulos (appellee in this court) was appointed receiver of American Bridge Products, Inc., by a Massachusetts state court, and more than 13 years ago American Bridge was put into involuntary bankruptcy. Most of the issues involved in American Bridge's receivership and bankruptcy have been resolved, but a claim endures by bankruptcy trustee Lynne Riley (now appellant in this court) to recover from Decoulos for misfeasance while receiver that damaged the American Bridge estate. That claim is the subject of the present appeal.</p>\n<p>In August 1993, American Bridge and its then-owners filed a complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court alleging that a group of defendantsincluding Robert Conti, a major investor in American Bridge, and John Conti, Robert's son and a former employee of American Bridge had converted and were conspiring to convert American Bridge's assets to their private benefit in fraud of the company's creditors. Everett Savings Bank was also charged with assisting Robert Conti to divert American Bridge's bank assets into accounts controlled by Conti.</p>\n<p>The next month, the state court appointed Decoulos as receiver of American Bridge. Not long after, American Bridge's principals and creditors began to complain about Decoulos' performance as receiver. Efforts opposing Decoulos began in October 1993, and included a failed attempt to put the company into federal bankruptcy proceedings, fruitless complaints about Decoulos to state bar authorities, and objections to Decoulos' fee and other applications, which were nevertheless approved by the state court, summarily so in most cases. In July 1995, American Bridge's owners filed the first of two unsuccessful motions seeking to remove Decoulos as receiver.</p>\n<p>In August 1996, the owners and a major creditor of American Bridge filed an involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition against the company. When Decoulos resisted, proponents filed an affidavit that set forth in detail Decoulos' shortcomings as receiver. In October, the federal bankruptcy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> court granted the motion for an involuntary bankruptcy and shortly thereafter appointed Joseph Braunstein as bankruptcy trustee. Control of the estate passed to him.</p>\n<p>Under the Bankruptcy Code, Decoulos now had an obligation to account to the federal court as to the property he had held as receiver (and which now passed to the trustee). 11 U.S.C. § 543(b)(2) (2006) (accounting requirement); <i>id.</i> § 543(c) (surcharge authority); Fed. R. Bankr.P. 6002 (2009). Without filing an accounting, Decoulos sought compensation for earlier work as receiver. Braunstein and several creditors objected and the court allowed an examination of Decoulos as to the fate of certain American Bridge assets. The matter then remained in limbo while other disputes involving the bankruptcy were resolved. In March 1999, Braunstein resigned as trustee and was replaced in October 1999 by Riley.</p>\n<p>On March 9, 2000, Riley filed an adversary proceeding against Decoulos personally, alleging <i>inter alia</i> negligence and breach of fiduciary duty by Decoulos in his capacity as receiver.<sup>[1]</sup> Under Massachusetts law, these two claims had a three-year statute of limitations, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (2009); <i>LoCicero v. Leslie,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2098460\"><a href=\"/opinion/2098460/locicero-v-leslie/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 12 n. 2 (D.Mass. 1996), and Decoulos had ceased to be a receiver in 1996. Further, Riley's predecessor Braunstein had investigated possible claims against Decoulos and determined not to pursue them.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the bankruptcy court rejected Decoulos' statute of limitations objection on the ground that the statute did not start to run until Decoulos had accounted for his administration and been discharged, and neither had occurred either in the state court prior to bankruptcy or in the bankruptcy court thereafter. <i>In re Am. Bridge Prods., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1842610\"><a href=\"/opinion/1842610/in-re-american-bridge-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 350 (Bankr.D.Mass.2005). A trial on Riley's claims, held over 15 days in 2004, resulted in detailed findings by the bankruptcy judge that Decoulos had mismanaged the receivership, and a substantial judgment was awarded to Riley as trustee. <i>Id.</i> at 341-50, 356.</p>\n<p>Liability was imposed, with particulars, for \"fail[ing] to adhere to the orders issued by the\" state court, \"fail[ing] to take possession of [American Bridge]'s assets in a timely manner,\" \"fail[ing] to recognize and proceed with causes of action,\" \"fail[ing] to act impartially in considering the allegations in\" American Bridge's Complaint, \"fail[ing] to take steps\" to prevent the conversion of American Bridge's assets, and \"fail[ing] to seek, let alone obtain, appropriate court orders\" to pursue actions against the defendants in the litigation. <i>In re Am. Bridge Prods.,</i> 328 B.R. at 342.</p>\n<p>The judgment against Decoulos was for the lesser of $379,173.78 or the amount needed to pay all creditors and administrative claims of the estate, <i>In re Am. Bridge Prods.,</i> 328 B.R. at 356, amended thereafter to add prejudgment interest. The damages, calculated item by item, comprised waste of inventory and materials under Decoulos' management; diminishment of value of assets; unremedied diversion to the Contis of debts owed the company; and unremedied loss due to similar diversion by Everett Savings Bank. <i>Id.</i> at 349. The bankruptcy court also ordered Decoulos to disgorge any fees paid to him while receiver. <i>Id.</i> at 349-50.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> On appeal, the district court reversed, ruling that the Massachusetts statute of limitations ran from the discovery of Decoulos' actions and barred Riley's claims. <i>In re Am. Bridge Prods., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1839355\"><a href=\"/opinion/1839355/in-re-american-bridge-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span>, 730-34, 736 (D.Mass.2009). Riley now appeals. Decoulos defends the district court and, in addition, offers alternative grounds for sustaining its result. Our review of rulings of law is de novo; the bankruptcy court's findings are tested for clear error. <i>In re Northwood Props., LLC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203038\"><a href=\"/opinion/203038/in-re-northwood-properties-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>At the threshold, Decoulos claims that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, arguing first that under <i>Barton v. Barbour,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90434\"><a href=\"/opinion/90434/barton-v-barbour/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span>, 136, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></span> (1881), actions against the receiver required the approval of the state court and, second, that under the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine federal courts cannot review final orders of a state court. <i>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Darr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201141\"><a href=\"/opinion/201141/muratore-v-darr/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span>, 146-47 (1st Cir.2004); <i>but cf. </i><i>Robinson v.

In this case, authority over the estate had passed to the federal courts before Riley's claim was filed; the receiver was therefore responsible to account to the bankruptcy court, and Riley had permission from that court to bring suit. Thus, the concerns that animated <i>Barton</i> were not present.</p>\n<p>As for <i>Rooker-Feldman,</i> the rule applies only when \"the losing party in state court filed suit in federal court after the state proceedings ended, complaining of an injury caused by the state-court judgment and seeking review and rejection of that judgment.\" <i>Exxon Mobil Corp. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span> (2005). Whatever limited and implicit attention the state court may have paid to charges of wrongdoing when approving Decoulos' various applications on largely unrelated topics, no prior judgment was entered by the state court on the claims that Riley now pursues.</p>\n<p>Finally, the bankruptcy court had authority to resolve Riley's claims. Decoulos had made his own claim in the bankruptcy court for compensation and a compulsory counterclaim appears to fall within the statutory definition of core proceedings. 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2); <i>In re CBI Holding Co., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1455566\"><a href=\"/opinion/1455566/in-re-cbi-holding-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, 460 (2d Cir.2008); <i>In re Am. Bridge Prods.,</i> 398 B.R. at 729-30. We need not determine whether, independently, the statutory surcharge power under 11 U.S.C. § 543 extends to pre-bankruptcy conduct by a prior custodian. <i>See generally </i><i>In re Sundance Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1982130\"><a href=\"/opinion/1982130/in-re-sundance-corp-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 650 (Bankr. E.D.Wash.1993).</p>\n<p>On the merits, we agree with Decoulos that but for his status as receiver, the limitations defense would likely succeed. Riley framed her charge as state causes of action for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty, and she does not argue they have become federal claims merely because the estate later entered federal bankruptcy. As already noted, the Massachusetts limitations period for the state claims is three years, and Decoulos' challenged conduct as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> receiver occurred more than three years before Riley sued.</p>\n<p>Of course, limitations statutes may be tolled where the wrongful conduct was concealed or difficult to ascertain at the time it occurred. <i>E.g., </i><i>Koe v. Mercer,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></span>, 836 (2007). But although Riley contends otherwise, enough was known by those who objected to Decoulos' conduct in the state court and by Braunstein, who conducted his own investigation, to bring an end to such tolling more than three years before Riley's suit. We would describe the pertinent facts in detail if the fate of Riley's appeal depended on this tolling issue, but it does not.</p>\n<p>The bankruptcy court rejected the limitations defense not because of concealment or lack of knowledge but on the ground that Decoulos had not rendered a final accounting or been discharged in either state or federal court. <i>In re Am. Bridge Prods.,</i> 328 B.R. at 350. In the bankruptcy judge's view, a receiver or bankruptcy trustee's liability for misconduct remains open, despite ordinary limitations rules, until a final accounting and discharge (unless, presumably, the issue had been definitively determined by a competent court before a final accounting).</p>\n<p>Thus, the bankruptcy judge said that \"[a]ny determination of a receiver's liability, whether personal or official, is not subject to a statute of limitations defense in the absence of his discharge,\" 328 B.R. at 350, citing to a passage of the treatise <i>Clark on Receivers</i>; the passage can be read to say that a receiver's liability for misconduct in relation to his duties continues, despite the statute of limitations, until he has fulfilled his duty to account and is discharged.<sup>[2]</sup> \"Decoulos,\" the judge pointed out, \"neither received a discharge in [state court] nor filed a report and account in accordance with Fed. R. Bankr.P. 6002.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In reversing, the district court said that the treatise position, supported only by citation to a 19th-century English case, might have been referring only to actions against the receiver in an official capacity (as opposed to personal dereliction) and anyway nothing showed that Massachusetts has adopted the treatise position. <i>In re Am. Bridge Prods.,</i> 398 B.R. at 730-32. The district court thought the position refuted by Massachusetts cases indicating that where an ordinary trustee breaches his duties and repudiates the trust, the limitations period begins to run when a beneficiary has knowledge of the breach and repudiation. <i>E.g., </i><i>Lattuca v. Robsham,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></span>, 884 (2004).</p>\n<p>However, this court <i>In re San Juan Hotel Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506588\"><a href=\"/opinion/506588/bankr-l-rep-p-72300-in-re-san-juan-hotel-corporation-debtor-hans/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1988), rejected a former bankruptcy trustee's argument that \"personal liability actions against a bankruptcy trustee can be time-barred before the trustee has presented a final account to the bankruptcy court and been discharged.\" <i>Id.</i> at 939. Instead, the court held \"a trustee cannot be released from liability before discharge\" because the purpose of the final accounting is to ensure that a trustee can be held accountable after making full disclosure. <i>Id.</i> at 939.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> True, the trustee in <i>San Juan Hotel</i> was already under federal authority when he committed his wrongs while Decoulos was a state receiver at the time of the wrongs. Although the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to decide the claims against Decoulos, facially the claims remained ones arising under state law and presumptively Riley could not recover if those claims were now barred under state limitations rules. The first assumption seems fairly secure and the second, if perhaps open to debate, we will assume <i>arguendo</i> in favor of Decoulos.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Claims against a trustee for breach of fiduciary duty are typically equitable claims, <i>In re San Juan Hotel Corp.,</i> 847 F.2d at 938, but, in Massachusetts, such equitable claims are nevertheless subject to statutes of limitation. <i>Stoneham Five Cents Sav. Bank v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></span>, 732 (1936) (\"statutes of limitation apply of their own force to suits in equity\"); <i>Farnam v. Brooks,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></span>, 216 (1830); 6 Smith &amp; Zobel, <i>Massachusetts Practice</i> § 8.17 (2d ed.2006). The district judge was correct in saying that in a suit against an ordinary faithless or incompetent trustee, the statute begins to run once the wrongdoing comes to light. <i>O'Connor v. Redstone,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></span>, 607-09 (2008).</p>\n<p>But ordinary trusts operate without much court supervision and often indefinitely. Receivers and bankruptcy trustees, by contrast, look to wind up an estate, aiming at a final, closing-the-books accounting. Hess, Bogert &amp; Bogert, <i>The Law of Trusts and Trustees</i> § 14, 165-71 (3d ed.2008); Scott &amp; Fratcher, <i>The Law of Trusts</i> § 16A, 211-12 (4th ed.1989). <i>San Juan Hotel</i> treated the rule it propounded not as some peculiarity of federal law but as a general rule applicable to trustees who are winding up estates, and the Clark treatise relied upon by the bankruptcy judge was not focused on federal law at all. Absent Massachusetts case law to the contrary, it is reasonable to assume that Massachusetts would follow the same approach in cases where the receiver is engaged in winding up an estate. <i>Cf.</i> Mass. R. Civ. P. 66(e) (\"[N]o order discharging a receiver from further responsibility will be entered until he has settled his final account.\").</p>\n<p>Decoulos argues that the Clark treatise approach entails liability without limit in time, but filing the required accounting and obtaining a discharge would trigger limitations protections. <i>In re San Juan Hotel Corp.,</i> 847 F.2d at 940. Further, although limitations periods have not run, Massachusetts case law allows laches to be asserted against equitable claims where undue delay combines with prejudice. <i>Cohen v. Bailly,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></span>, 11 (1929); <i>W. Broadway Task Force v. Boston Hous. Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></span>, 716 (1993). So even without a final accounting, Decoulos was free to show that he had been prejudiced by the delay in the claims against him; but he did not do so.</p>\n<p>Decoulos does argue that his receivership terminated; that he gave an \"oral accounting\" to Braunstein; and that the bankruptcy court's authority to \"surcharge\" is limited only to improper disbursements. But termination neither extinguishes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> liabilities nor under <i>San Juan Hotel</i> and the Clark treatise starts the limitations period running. And an accounting must ordinarily be presented for <i>court</i> review, <i>e.g.,</i> Fed. R. Bankr.P. 6002; <i>In re Ira Haupt &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></span>, 322-23 (S.D.N.Y.1968); disclosure to a successor may have other consequences but it does not prompt a discharge or constitute approval by a court.</p>\n<p>Decoulos says that \"virtually all\" of the conduct for which he was surcharged had been approved by the state court and, under settled doctrine governing trustee conduct and under res judicata principles, cannot be made the basis for personal liability.<sup>[5]</sup> But most of the orders entered by the state court are unrelated to the actions for which the bankruptcy court surcharged him. Ironically, the bankruptcy court surcharged Decoulos in part for actions taken in disregard of or contrary to the orders of the state court which Decoulos claims protect him.</p>\n<p>The state court order most closely related to Riley's claims permitted Decoulos to sell American Bridge's personal property for $6,000 to a company controlled by the Contis. Decoulos argues this order barred the bankruptcy court from awarding $29,000 against him for allowing \"the loss and waste of [American Bridge]'s assets.\" <i>Id.</i> at 343. But the bankruptcy court premised liability not on misconduct making the sale approved by the state court, but on Decoulos' \"'failure to secure inventory and equipment belonging to [American Bridge],\" allowing conversion of $29,000 in value <i>before</i> the sale. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The other state court sale-of-assets order cited by Decoulos authorized him \"to sell the blueprint machine that is presently in the possession of John Conti for the sum of Eight Hundred ($800.00) Dollars.\" The bankruptcy court held Decoulos liable for the loss in value of $35,000 in equipment acquired in 1990, <i>id.</i> at 285, 344, but the blueprint machine, referred to by the bankruptcy court as having been purchased in 1993, <i>id.</i> at 298, does not appear to have been part of this category.</p>\n<p><i>In re Iannochino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199309\"><a href=\"/opinion/199309/iannacchino-v-rodolakis/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2001), relied on by Decoulos, is not on point. There, an attorney making a final fee request from an estate gained approval without objection as to the quality of his services and was later sued for malpractice. The complaint was deemed barred by claim preclusion on the ground that the misconduct could and should have been asserted as a defense to the fee award and that allowing the malpractice suit would undermine the final judgment by opening up the fee award to disgorgement, contrary to claim preclusion doctrine.</p>\n<p>Here, by contrast, objectors to the initial Decoulos fee request did object that Decoulos had been guilty of misconduct exactly what <i>Iannochino</i> says they should have done; but the state court seems to have ignored the issue and rejected two further requests to remove Decoulos with cursory or no explanation. Of course, had the state court heard evidence and made findings vindicating Decoulos, there might be possible claims of issue preclusion; but the burden of showing such a vindication was upon Decoulos and he has not even attempted any such showing.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> Lastly, Decoulos argues that the bankruptcy court was barred from imposing liability on him for failing to pursue prompt action against Everett Savings Bank because, in his last report to the state court, Decoulos reported the full amount of the misappropriation, along with the bank's possible defenses. Decoulos' mere reporting of the amount of the claim does not indicate that the state court approved his failure to pursue it. In a nutshell, the state court does not appear to have authorized or approved the challenged conduct.</p>\n<p>Decoulos does not argue on appeal that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that he breached his duty of care, but does argue in closing that the evidence does not support the finding that his actions or inactions caused the damages assessed.

Costs are taxed in favor of the appellant.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Riley also brought a claim for unfair trade practices, claims against Decoulos in his capacity as attorney to the estate, claims against his law firm and claims against other defendants, but none of these are at issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p>[2]  \"<i>Statute of limitations does not run in favor of receiver.</i> The position of a receiver is one in which liability to account would not easily be barred, and so long as he is living he must be held to have been a trustee of the money received[,] therefore the defense of the statute of limitations is not a bar to a claim against him.\" Clark, <i>Law of Receivers,</i> § 418, at 705-06 (3d ed.1959).</p>\n<p>[3]  This was one of two alternative grounds adopted in <i>San Juan Hotel</i> (the other being tolling of the statute until the wrong was revealed). <i>San Juan Hotel</i> is not binding precedent as to Massachusetts law but rather is relevant and useful authority.</p>\n<p>[4]  Occasionally, a federal connection may convert state law claims into ones governed by federal law, <i>Metropolitan Life Ins.
