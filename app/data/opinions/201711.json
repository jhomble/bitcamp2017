Gustavo A. Gelpi, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Lorenzo J.

Claimant Jorge L. Rosado-Sierra appeals from\n\nthe district court's decision to grant the motion of the United\n\nStates for entry of summary judgment in this in rem action for\n\nforfeiture of approximately $31,000 in U.S. currency.       He seeks\n\nreversal on the grounds that there is a genuine issue of material\n\nfact which remains controverted and that the magistrate judge to\n\nwhom the case was referred should have recused himself because he\n\nrepresented Rosado-Sierra in an earlier action pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255.   For the reasons we stated in our November 16, 2004\n\norder, we reject the government's argument that this appeal is\n\nuntimely.\n\n            I. Recusal\n\n            With respect to Rosado-Sierra's claim that the magistrate\n\njudge should have recused himself from presiding over this case\n\nbecause of his prior representation of Rosado-Sierra, that argument\n\nwas not raised in the district court.      To the contrary, Rosado-\n\nSierra submitted a statement expressly consenting to the referral\n\nof the case to the Magistrate Judge.1      \"Our law is clear that a\n\nparty ordinarily may not raise on appeal issues that were not\n\nseasonably advanced (and, hence, preserved) below.\" Daigle v. Maine\n\nMedical Center, Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir. 1994).    Appellant\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Because it was not presented to the district court, we do\nnot consider Appellant's claim that his attorney filed the consent\nform without Rosado-Sierra's knowledge or consent.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fhas forfeited that issue and we see no sufficient basis warranting\n\nexcusing the forfeiture.\n\n            II. Summary Judgment\n\n            The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act (CAFRA) applies\n\nto civil forfeiture cases which, like this one, were commenced on\n\nor after August 23, 2000.      \"CAFRA heightens the government's\n\nevidentiary burden in civil forfeitures.\" United States v. Funds\n\nin Amount of $30,670.00, 403 F.3d 448, 454 (7th Cir. 2005).     The\n\ngovernment has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that the property is subject to forfeiture. § 983(c).\n\n(Formerly the standard was probable cause.) To meet this burden,\n\nthe government may rely on evidence obtained after the filing of\n\nthe complaint for forfeiture.        Furthermore, where (as in this\n\ncase) the\n\n            Government's theory of forfeiture is that\n            the   property  was  used   to   commit  or\n            facilitate the commission of a criminal\n            offense, or was involved in the commission\n            of a criminal offense, the Government shall\n            establish that there was a substantial\n            connection between the property and the\n            offense.\n\n§ 938(c)(3).\n\n            To satisfy its burden, the government relied upon the\n\nfollowing uncontested facts:\n\n            the $21,510.00 in cash found inside a black\n            duffle bag and the $10,240.00 in cash found\n            inside a beige safety deposit box were found\n            in the same area of the [claimant's] house\n            where the diazepam and lactose were found,\n\n                                   -3-\n\f          and all items were seized pursuant to a\n          federal search warrant.      Moreover, the\n          claimant pled guilty to the drug conspiracy\n          charge arising from the execution of that\n          search warrant, and which gave rise to the\n          present action.\n\nUnited States v. $21,510 in U.S. Currency, 292 F. Supp. 2d 318,\n\n322 (D. Puerto Rico 2003).   The record also reveals that a canine\n\nsearch indicated the presence of controlled substances on the\n\nseized currency.   As part of his guilty plea, Rosado-Sierra\n\nspecifically admitted to discussing the purchase of narcotics\n\nwith a co-conspirator in February, 2002, less than four months\n\nbefore the seizure of the currency.\n\n          These facts are probative of a connection between the\n\nseized currency and drug trafficking.     \"A claimant's record of\n\ndrug activity is a highly probative factor in the forfeiture\n\ncalculus.\" United States v. $67,220.00 in U.S. Currency, 957 F.2d\n\n280, 286 (6th Cir. 1992). See United States v. $87,118.00 in U.S.\n\nCurrency, 95 F.3d 511, 519 (7th Cir. 1996); United States v.\n\n$19,960.00, 897 F.2d 1457, 1462-63 (8th Cir. 1990).       A large\n\namount of hidden currency \"is strong evidence of . . . an illicit\n\nconnection to drug trafficking.\" United States v. $149,442.43 in\n\nU.S. Currency, 965 F.2d 868, 877 (10th Cir. 1992).   The fact that\n\ndrugs were not found on the scene when the cash was seized \"is\n\nnot fatal to the government's case.\" United States v. One Lot of\n\nU.S. Currency($36,634), 103 F.3d 1048, 1055 (1st Cir. 1997).   The\n\ndog's alert to the presence of controlled substances on the\n\n                                -4-\n\fseized currency \"weighs some, but not a great deal on the scale.\"\n\nId. at 1056.2\n\n            To demonstrate that the currency was not connected to\n\ndrug trafficking, Rosado-Sierra relied upon his declaration that\n\nthe currency was \"the proceeds and working capital of [his]\n\nlegitimate business Rosado Construction.\"            In his answer to\n\ninterrogatories, Rosada-Sierra stated that Rosado Construction\n\n\"operated   on   a   cash-payment    basis   with   its   clients.\"   He\n\nsubmitted copies of his tax returns for 1999-2001.              The 2001\n\nreturn reported gross income from Rosado Construction of $126,476\n\nand expenses of $89,528, resulting in net income of $36,948.\n\nRosado-Sierra points out that the expenses included depreciation\n\nof capital equal to $16,511, so that the total after tax proceeds\n\nfrom the business were $52,733.\n\n            Even if the information from the 2001 tax return is\n\naccepted as true, Rosado-Sierra still has not created a genuine\n\nissue of material fact.     As explanation for the presence of the\n\nlarge quantity of cash at his apartment, Rosado-Sierra maintains\n\nthat Rosado Construction was operated on a \"cash payment basis\"\n\n\n\n     2\n       It is appropriate to rely upon forfeiture case law decided\nbefore the enactment of CAFRA. Although those cases applied the\nless-burdensome probable cause standard, \"[f]actors that weighed in\nfavor of forfeiture in the past continue to do so now - with the\nobvious caveat that the government must show more or stronger\nevidence establishing a link between forfeited property and illegal\nactivity.\" United States v. Funds in Amount of $30,670.00, 403 F.3d\n448, 469 (7th Cir. 2005).\n\n                                    -5-\n\fbut has provided no receipts or other documentation of that fact\n\nand no explanation for the absence of documentation.               See United\n\nStates v. Funds in Amount of $30,670.00, 403 F.3d 448, 468 (7th\n\nCir. 2005)(affirming summary judgment in government's favor where\n\nclaimant \"provided no receipts or other proof regarding origins\n\nof the cash\"). Moreover, \"the government introduced much more to\n\nshow   [a   substantial     connection        between   currency       and   drug\n\ntrafficking] than simply a comparison of [Rosado-Sierra's] income\n\nwith his expenditures.\" United States v. Parcels of Land, 903\n\nF.2d 36, 42 (1st Cir. 1990).       In these circumstances, we conclude\n\nthat no rational factfinder could permissibly credit Rosado-\n\nSierra's undocumented assertion.\n\n            Rosado-Sierra     argued     in   his   opposition     to    summary\n\njudgment that the fact that \"alleged cutting agents were found in\n\nMr. Rosado-Sierra's residence the day of the                    search proves\n\nnothing in    the   absence   of   any    evidence      of    recent    criminal\n\nactivity.\" Dkt No. 32, p. 7 (emphasis added).                He further argued\n\nthat his indictment based on intercepted conversations that\n\noccurred two years prior to the search could not establish the\n\nrequisite substantial connection between the seized currency and\n\ndrug trafficking.     However, as part of his guilty plea, Rosado-\n\nSierra admitted to having discussed with other indicted co-\n\nconspirators the purchase of narcotics in February 2002, less\n\nthan four months before the seizure.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f          Based on the totality of circumstances, and reviewing\n\nthe district court's determination de novo, we conclude that\n\nRosado-Sierra has not created a genuine issue of material fact.\n\nTherefore, the district court order granting the government's\n\nmotion for summary judgment is affirmed. See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                              -7-\n\f",

Although those cases applied the\nless-burdensome probable cause standard, \"[f]actors that weighed in\nfavor of forfeiture in the past continue to do so now - with the\nobvious caveat that the government must show more or stronger\nevidence establishing a link between forfeited property and illegal\nactivity.\" United States v.

In these circumstances, we conclude\n\nthat no rational factfinder could permissibly credit Rosado-\n\nSierra's undocumented assertion.\n\n            Rosado-Sierra     argued     in   his   opposition     to    summary\n\njudgment that the fact that \"alleged cutting agents were found in\n\nMr. Rosado-Sierra's residence the day of the                    search proves\n\nnothing in    the   absence   of   any    evidence      of    recent    criminal\n\nactivity.\" Dkt No. 32, p. 7 (emphasis added).                He further argued\n\nthat his indictment based on intercepted conversations that\n\noccurred two years prior to the search could not establish the\n\nrequisite substantial connection between the seized currency and\n\ndrug trafficking.     However, as part of his guilty plea, Rosado-\n\nSierra admitted to having discussed with other indicted co-\n\nconspirators the purchase of narcotics in February 2002, less\n\nthan four months before the seizure.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f          Based on the totality of circumstances, and reviewing\n\nthe district court's determination de novo, we conclude that\n\nRosado-Sierra has not created a genuine issue of material fact.\n\nTherefore, the district court order granting the government's\n\nmotion for summary judgment is affirmed.
