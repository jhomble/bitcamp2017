George Chapdelaine  is appealing  the\n                    \n\ndistrict court's order applying $22,300.46, which  was seized\n\nfrom his room  during a search in  1991, toward Chapdelaine's\n\noutstanding criminal fine.  We affirm.\n\n          In  1985,  Chapdelaine  was  convicted  of  a  drug\n\noffense, and  the district  court imposed imprisonment  and a\n\n$10,000 fine on him.  In 1993, the government moved to  apply\n\nthe proceeds  of the cash it  had seized to the  fine and the\n\ninterest  that had  accumulated  thereon.   As  of May  1993,\n\nChapdelaine  owed a balance of $9,571.75 on the fine, and the\n\ngovernment  claimed interest  of $13,338.59,  for a  total of\n\n$22,910.34.   At a hearing,  the government claimed  that the\n\nCriminal Fine  Enforcement Act of 1984,  formerly codified at\n\n18 U.S.C.    3565(c)(1), required interest to  be assessed on\n\nChapdelaine's outstanding criminal fine, and submitted a copy\n\nof the statute to the court.  \n\n          Chapdelaine  denied  that  any  statute  authorized\n\ninterest on criminal fines prior to 1987.  He told the  court\n\nthat  some of  the money  seized by  the government  had come\n\neither from his pension  or from work he had  performed after\n\nbeing released from prison; he also acknowledged that some of\n\nthe money  represented gambling proceeds.  He  argued that it\n\nwould  be unfair  for the  government to  apply funds  he had\n\nearned  toward  his fine.   Finally,  he  said that  the fine\n\n                             -2-\n\nshould  never have been imposed in 1985 since he was indigent\n\nat that time.\n\n          In response  to Chapdelaine's arguments,  the court\n\nstated that the question of Chapdelaine's ability to pay  the\n\nfine  when imposed had been \"resolved long since.\"  It sought\n\nto ascertain how Chapdelaine could have acquired such a large\n\nsum of money by 1991  when he had told the court in 1990 that\n\nhe was indigent.  It expressed its doubt that the money found\n\nin  Chapdelaine's room represented  his savings  since 1990,1\n\nand  noted that  Chapdelaine  had had  many opportunities  to\n\ncontest the  fine and to  seek its  remission in court.   The\n\ncourt said that in fairness  Chapdelaine should pay the fine,\n\nparticularly  in   view  of   the  fact   that  Chapdelaine's\n\nchallenges  to his  fine had  been underwritten  by taxpayers\n\nwhose taxes  fund the court  system.  Accordingly,  the court\n\nordered   the   seized   money   applied   to  satisfy   both\n\nChapdelaine's fine and the interest thereon.\n\n          Chapdelaine makes several arguments on appeal, none\n\nof  which have merit.  First, he  says that the court did not\n\nrule  on the question whether interest could be assessed on a\n\ncriminal  fine imposed  in 1985,  and that  the court  had no\n\nauthority to assess interest on the original fine.   Although\n\n                    \n\n1.  According to an undated  personal financial statement  in\nthe   record,   which   apparently  reflected   Chapdelaine's\nfinancial status  as of late 1989,  Chapdelaine was receiving\n$758/month in  social security and  veterans pension benefits\nand had monthly expenses totalling approximately $710.\n\n                             -3-\n\nthe court did not  specifically hold that statutory authority\n\nexisted for assessing interest, by granting  the government's\n\nmotion  it  clearly  indicated   that  it  had  accepted  the\n\ngovernment's  argument that interest was authorized under the\n\nCriminal Fine Enforcement Act of  1984 (\"Act\").  Moreover, as\n\nChapdelaine  acknowledges,  in   United  States  v.  Atlantic\n                                                             \n\nDisposal  Service,  Inc., 887  F.2d  1208,  1209-11 (3d  Cir.\n                        \n\n1989), the Third Circuit  analyzed the criminal fine statutes\n\nin existence for the  1984-87 time period and concluded  that\n\nthe interest provision of the Act applied to crimes committed\n\nbetween December 31,  1984 and  November 1, 1987.   See  also\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v. Finley,  783 F. Supp. 1123, 1126  (N.D. Ill.\n                       \n\n1991)  (applying that provision to a fine imposed for a crime\n\ncommitted before November 1, 1987). \n\n          Although  Chapdelaine  appears   to  question   the\n\ncourt's   analysis  of  Congressional  intent,  his  argument\n\napparently relates to a different statute, section 238 of the\n\nSentencing Reform  Act, which had also  provided for interest\n\non  fines,  but which  had been  repealed  by the  Act.   See\n                                                             \n\nAtlantic Disposal Service, supra, 887 F.2d at 1210 &amp; n.6.  We\n                                \n\naccept the  Third Circuit's analysis  in this case  and agree\n\nthat the  interest provision  of  the Act,  which applied  to\n\noffenses committed after December 31,  1984, see P.L. No. 98-\n                                                \n\n596,   10,  1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.  (98 Stat.) 3138,  and was  not\n\nrepealed  until November 1, 1987,  see 18 U.S.C.    3561-3580\n                                      \n\n                             -4-\n\n(Supp.  V 1988) (note on  repeal of Chapter  227), applied to\n\nthecriminalfine imposedon Chapdelaineforhis 1985drug offense.\n\n          Second, Chapdelaine argues  that the district court\n\nerred  by failing  to consider  his claim  that the  fine was\n\nillegal  when imposed because he was indigent.  The court did\n\nconsider that  claim, but rejected it,  because that question\n\nhad  already been  decided  against  Chapdelaine in  previous\n\nproceedings.   Chapdelaine does not dispute  that prior court\n\nproceedings had determined that  he could pay the fine  as of\n\nthe  time it  was  imposed.   The  record does  not  indicate\n\nwhether  Chapdelaine  challenged his  fine  in appealing  his\n\nconviction to this court or  whether his subsequent motion to\n\nreduce the fine alleged inability  to pay at the time  he was\n\nsentenced.   In any event, in  reviewing Chapdelaine's motion\n\nto remit his fine  in 1990 the court squarely  considered and\n\nrejected  Chapdelaine's claim  that he  had been  indigent in\n\n1985  when the fine was  imposed on him;  Chapdelaine did not\n\nappeal that determination.2   Finally,  Chapdelaine  suggests\n\n                    \n\n2.  The docket sheet from Chapdelaine's underlying conviction\nindicates that his conviction (and presumably sentencing) had\nbeen  affirmed in 1986, and  that soon thereafter  he filed a\nmotion for a  reduction of  his sentence.   The docket  sheet\nindicates that the court's order denied his request to reduce\nhis fine and  to remit  a special assessment  which had  also\nbeen imposed on  him, but  does not make  clear what  grounds\nChapdelaine had alleged in  support thereof.  In 1990,  after\nChapdelaine was released from prison, a hearing was held on a\nmotion  he  brought  to   remit  his  fine,  and  Chapdelaine\ntestified that he  could not pay the fine at  that time.  The\nmagistrate agreed, but concluded that Chapdelaine's \"claim of\nindigency  at the time of his arrest is inconsistent with the\n\n                             -5-\n\nthat the court  granted the government's  motion in order  to\n\npunish  him for seeking  redress of his  grievances in court.\n\nThe transcript  of the  hearing indicates quite  clearly that\n\nthe court had  no punitive  intent, but that  its purpose  in\n\ndescribing  Chapdelaine's  recourse  to  the  courts  was  to\n\ndemonstrate that there was no unfairness in requiring  him to\n\npay his fine.  \n\n          Although  Chapdelaine raises  additional arguments,\n\nwe  decline to  consider them,  either because they  were not\n\nraised  in  his  initial  brief,  or because  they  were  not\n\npresented  to the district court.  See Playboy Enterprises v.\n                                                          \n\nPublic Service  Commission of  Puerto Rico,  906 F.2d  25, 40\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 498 U.S. 959  (1990) (an appellant\n                         \n\nwaives issues  not adequately  raised in its  initial brief);\n\nUnited States v.

The magistrate also\nrecommended dismissal of Chapdelaine's motion to remit to the\nextent  it was based on  the claim that  the sentencing judge\nhad  not  considered  the factors  in  18  U.S.C.    3622  in\nimposing the fine,  because the motion was  untimely; he also\nfound  that no other  statutory basis for  remitting the fine\nexisted.    After Chapdelaine  failed  to  object, the  court\nissued  an  order  accepting  the   magistrate's  report  and\nrecommendation.  Subsequently, however, a hearing was held on\nthe report, and Chapdelaine again testified,  apparently only\nas to his ability to then pay the fine.  The court thereafter\ndenied  his motion  to  remit his  fine  since there  was  no\nstatutory basis for doing so.

Moreover, as Chapdelaine acknowledges, in United States v. Atlantic Disposal Service, Inc., 887 F.2d 1208, 1209-11 (3d Cir.1989), the Third Circuit analyzed the criminal fine statutes in existence for the 1984-87 time period and concluded that the interest provision of the Act applied to crimes committed between December 31, 1984 and November 1, 1987.  See also United States v.

We accept the Third Circuit's analysis in this case and agree that the interest provision of the Act, which applied to offenses committed after December 31, 1984, see P.L.

Chapdelaine, 616 F.Supp. 522 (D.R.I.1985), aff'd, 795 F.2d 75 (1st Cir.1986) (table)).  The magistrate also recommended dismissal of Chapdelaine's motion to remit to the extent it was based on the claim that the sentencing judge had not considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3622 in imposing the fine, because the motion was untimely;  he also found that no other statutory basis for remitting the fine existed.  After Chapdelaine failed to object, the court issued an order accepting the magistrate's report and recommendation.  Subsequently, however, a hearing was held on the report, and Chapdelaine again testified, apparently only as to his ability to then pay the fine.  The court thereafter denied his motion to remit his fine since there was no statutory basis for doing so.  Chapdelaine did not appeal</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

U.S. Atty., Providence, RI, on brief for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before BREYER, Chief Judge, BOUDIN and STAHL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PER CURIAM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">George Chapdelaine is appealing the district court's order applying $22,300.46, which was seized from his room during a search in 1991, toward Chapdelaine's outstanding criminal fine.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1985, Chapdelaine was convicted of a drug offense, and the district court imposed imprisonment and a $10,000 fine on him.  In 1993, the government moved to apply the proceeds of the cash it had seized to the fine and the interest that had accumulated thereon.  As of May 1993, Chapdelaine owed a balance of $9,571.75 on the fine, and the government claimed interest of $13,338.59, for a total of $22,910.34.  At a hearing, the government claimed that the Criminal Fine Enforcement Act of 1984, formerly codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3565(c)(1), required interest to be assessed on Chapdelaine's outstanding criminal fine, and submitted a copy of the statute to the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapdelaine denied that any statute authorized interest on criminal fines prior to 1987.  He told the court that some of the money seized by the government had come either from his pension or from work he had performed after being released from prison;  he also acknowledged that some of the money represented gambling proceeds.  He argued that it would be unfair for the government to apply funds he had earned toward his fine.  Finally, he said that the fine should never have been imposed in 1985 since he was indigent at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Chapdelaine's arguments, the court stated that the question of Chapdelaine's ability to pay the fine when imposed had been \"resolved long since.\"   It sought to ascertain how Chapdelaine could have acquired such a large sum of money by 1991 when he had told the court in 1990 that he was indigent.  It expressed its doubt that the money found in Chapdelaine's room represented his savings since 1990,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and noted that Chapdelaine had had many opportunities to contest the fine and to seek its remission in court.  The court said that in fairness Chapdelaine should pay the fine, particularly in view of the fact that Chapdelaine's challenges to his fine had been underwritten by taxpayers whose taxes fund the court system.  Accordingly, the court ordered the seized money applied to satisfy both Chapdelaine's fine and the interest thereon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapdelaine makes several arguments on appeal, none of which have merit.  First, he says that the court did not rule on the question whether interest could be assessed on a criminal fine imposed in 1985, and that the court had no authority to assess interest on the original fine.  Although the court did not specifically hold that statutory authority existed for assessing interest, by granting the government's motion it clearly indicated that it had accepted the government's argument that interest was authorized under the Criminal Fine Enforcement Act of 1984 (\"Act\").  Moreover, as Chapdelaine acknowledges, in United States v. Atlantic Disposal Service, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531013\"><a href=\"/opinion/531013/united-states-v-atlantic-disposal-service-inc-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1208</span></a></span>, 1209-11 (3d Cir.1989), the Third Circuit analyzed the criminal fine statutes in existence for the 1984-87 time period and concluded that the interest provision of the Act applied to crimes committed between December 31, 1984 and November 1, 1987.  See also United States v. Finley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1361926\"><a href=\"/opinion/1361926/united-states-v-finley/\"><span class=\"volume\">783</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1123</span></a></span>, 1126 (N.D.Ill.1991) (applying that provision to a fine imposed for a crime committed before November 1, 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Chapdelaine appears to question the court's analysis of Congressional intent, his argument apparently relates to a different statute, section 238 of the Sentencing Reform Act, which had also provided for interest on fines, but which had been repealed by the Act.  See Atlantic Disposal Service, supra, 887 F.2d at 1210 &amp; n. 6.   We accept the Third Circuit's analysis in this case and agree that the interest provision of the Act, which applied to offenses committed after December 31, 1984, see P.L. No. 98-596, Sec. 10, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.  (98 Stat.) 3138, and was not repealed until November 1, 1987, see 18 U.S.C. Secs. 3561-3580 (Supp.  V 1988) (note on repeal of Chapter 227), applied to the criminal fine imposed on Chapdelaine for his 1985 drug offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Chapdelaine argues that the district court erred by failing to consider his claim that the fine was illegal when imposed because he was indigent.  The court did consider that claim, but rejected it, because that question had already been decided against Chapdelaine in previous proceedings.  Chapdelaine does not dispute that prior court proceedings had determined that he could pay the fine as of the time it was imposed.  The record does not indicate whether Chapdelaine challenged his fine in appealing his conviction to this court or whether his subsequent motion to reduce the fine alleged inability to pay at the time he was sentenced.  In any event, in reviewing Chapdelaine's motion to remit his fine in 1990 the court squarely considered and rejected Chapdelaine's claim that he had been indigent in 1985 when the fine was imposed on him;  Chapdelaine did not appeal that determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Chapdelaine suggests that the court granted the government's motion in order to punish him for seeking redress of his grievances in court.  The transcript of the hearing indicates quite clearly that the court had no punitive intent, but that its purpose in describing Chapdelaine's recourse to the courts was to demonstrate that there was no unfairness in requiring him to pay his fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Chapdelaine raises additional arguments, we decline to consider them, either because they were not raised in his initial brief, or because they were not presented to the district court.

The docket sheet indicates that the court's order denied his request to reduce his fine and to remit a special assessment which had also been imposed on him, but does not make clear what grounds Chapdelaine had alleged in support thereof.  In 1990, after Chapdelaine was released from prison, a hearing was held on a motion he brought to remit his fine, and Chapdelaine testified that he could not pay the fine at that time.  The magistrate agreed, but concluded that Chapdelaine's \"claim of indigency at the time of his arrest is inconsistent with the facts of his case, ... wherein [he] was found at the time of his arrest with $6,000 in his suitcase\" (citing United States v.
