R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Harold W. Clarke has\nbeen substituted for his predecessor Kathleen M. Dennehy, as\nCommissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Corrections.\n  **\n       Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f     TASHIMA, Circuit Judge.             Gerald Malone was convicted in\n\nMassachusetts Superior Court of rape and abuse of a child under\n\nsixteen,    and   indecent     assault      and   battery    of    a   child   under\n\nfourteen, based on a series of sexual assaults that he committed\n\nagainst his daughter when she was between the ages of eleven and\n\nfourteen.     After exhausting his state court remedies, Malone\n\npetitioned for federal habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254.\n\nMalone    alleged     that    his   trial    counsel      was     constitutionally\n\nineffective for failure to subpoena a police officer who could have\n\nimpeached the testimony of his daughter, who we refer to as \"K.M.,\"\n\nthe principal witness against him.            The district court denied the\n\npetition.     Because we conclude that the Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt's    decision    that    Malone    suffered    no     prejudice     from   his\n\ncounsel's failure to subpoena the witness was neither contrary to,\n\nnor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal\n\nlaw, we affirm the district court's denial of Malone's habeas\n\npetition.\n\nI.\n\n     Brenda and Gerald Malone were married and have two children\n\ntogether, \"K.M.\" and Whitney.         On July 20, 1999, as they often did,\n\nGerald and Brenda argued. Following the argument on this occasion,\n\nhowever, Brenda informed Gerald Malone (\"Malone\") that she no\n\nlonger wanted to be his wife, that she had consulted with a divorce\n\n\n                                      - 2 -\n\fattorney, and that she wanted him to move out of their house.\n\nAfter Malone packed his belongings and left the house, K.M. told\n\nher mother that her father had been raping her for nearly four and\n\na half years.\n\n      Upon hearing this, Brenda took K.M. to the South Yarmouth\n\nPolice Department.   There, K.M. was interviewed by Officer Cheryl\n\nNugent Gomsey.   Gomsey prepared an initial report which contained\n\nK.M.'s statements regarding her father's sexual assaults.        On\n\nOctober 26, 1999, Gomsey conducted a follow-up interview and\n\nprepared an additional report. In August 1999, Malone was indicted\n\non charges of raping and assaulting K.M.\n\n      At trial, the Commonwealth's case consisted of the testimony\n\nof K.M., her younger sister Whitney, and Brenda.   K.M. was the main\n\nwitness and she provided a vivid account of years of repeated rapes\n\nand sexual assaults by her father.1       K.M. began with the first\n\nincident (which occurred in 1995), telling the jury that when she\n\nwas 11 years old, her father called her into her mother's bedroom -\n\nMalone and Brenda lived apart at that time, but Malone regularly\n\nvisited -- and asked K.M. if she could \"do him a favor.\"       K.M.\n\ntestified that Malone was lying on the bed and a pornographic movie\n\nwas playing on the television.         He pulled the covers off of\n\n\n  1\n     Because this case turns on whether Malone was prejudiced by\nhis counsel's failure to call Officer Gomsey and counsel's alleged\nsubsequent failure to impeach K.M., it is necessary to describe\nK.M.'s testimony in some detail in order properly to assess the\nprejudice issue.\n\n                               - 3 -\n\fhimself,   exposing   his   naked    body   to   his   daughter.       Malone,\n\nreferring to his penis, told K.M. that he needed her to \"suck this\"\n\nfor him.   K.M. did as she was told, but while performing fellatio,\n\nshe accidentally bit Malone's penis.         Malone hit her on the head,\n\ntelling her \"Don't bite my shit again.\"          K.M. continued performing\n\noral sex until Malone ejaculated.\n\n      K.M. testified about other assaults.             The second occurred\n\nabout a week or two after the first.        K.M. testified that she came\n\nhome from school, and Malone was sitting in the living room.             Upon\n\nhearing his daughter come home, he called for her.             Malone asked\n\nher, \"Remember that favor I asked you to do a long time ago?\"             K.M.\n\nremembered, but said, \"I thought I didn't have to do this anymore,\n\nDaddy.\"    To this Malone responded, \"I changed my mind.\"               Being\n\nafraid, K.M. said okay.      Malone unzipped his pants, removed his\n\npenis, and ordered K.M. to perform oral sex on him, which she did.\n\n      K.M. testified to another assault which occurred shortly\n\nbefore her twelfth birthday.        This time, Malone called K.M. into\n\nher   mother's   bedroom.    Malone    reminded     her   of   their   family\n\n\"tradition\" of renting a limousine for the children's twelfth\n\nbirthdays -- Malone had rented a limousine for K.M.'s older sister\n\n(who we gather is not Malone's child) when she turned 12 and, at\n\nthat time, he told the other two children that they would get the\n\nsame thing on their twelfth birthdays.           In the bedroom, however,\n\nMalone told K.M. that if she wanted her limousine she would \"have\n\n\n                                    - 4 -\n\fto earn it.\"      K.M. testified that she understood what her father\n\nhad in mind.   He offered to let her \"do it\" after her birthday, but\n\nK.M. said no, preferring to \"do it\" then.     Malone ordered her to\n\ntake off all her clothes and perform oral sex on him.     Malone then\n\nperformed oral sex on her and had intercourse with her.\n\n     In June 1997, Brenda and Malone married, and, a few months\n\nbefore the wedding, Malone moved in with Brenda, K.M., and Whitney.\n\nK.M. testified to another sexual assault which occurred during this\n\nperiod.   This assault occurred after K.M had gotten into trouble\n\nfor being out too late.     According to K.M., Malone picked her up\n\nand drove her back home.    Once they returned home, Brenda \"started\n\nhollering and screaming at\" her.     Malone and Brenda quarreled for\n\na time, with Malone telling Brenda to leave K.M. alone.    Malone and\n\nK.M. eventually left in his car.    In the car, Malone told her that\n\nshe could \"redeem\" herself, saying that she had the chance to get\n\nout of trouble.    They drove off, and, while Malone was driving, he\n\nunzipped his pants and said, \"Here.\"     K.M. performed oral sex on\n\nMalone while he was driving.       Malone eventually pulled the car\n\nover, and K.M. continued the oral sex until Malone finished.    When\n\nasked why she never told anyone what was happening, K.M. testified\n\nthat Malone told her that if she told anyone about what was going\n\non, he would kill her.\n\n     In August 1998, when K.M. was around thirteen years old,\n\nBrenda, K.M, Whitney, and Malone moved into the house of Malone's\n\n\n                                 - 5 -\n\fbrother, Tony, or \"Uncle Tony\" as K.M. referred to him.        K.M.\n\ntestified that many instances of sexual abuse occurred at Tony's\n\nhouse.   On one occasion, K.M. came home from school with a bad\n\nprogress report and showed it to Malone, who responded angrily to\n\nthe news and asked why the report was poor.    She told Malone that\n\nshe was doing the best she could, but he accused her of lying.   He\n\nordered her to \"drop her drawers,\" which K.M. testified meant that\n\nhe wanted her to take everything off from the waist down.    Malone\n\nthen began to beat her with his belt, stopping only after he\n\nnoticed that his brother had pulled his vehicle into the driveway.\n\n     K.M. testified about another assault at Tony's house.     This\n\none occurred after K.M. came home from school and Malone confronted\n\nher with news that K.M.'s school had called to tell him that she\n\nhad received detention because she was talking in class and being\n\ndisruptive. Malone became angry and began beating her with a belt.\n\nMalone told her that she \"had a chance to redeem herself.\"     K.M.\n\nperformed oral sex on Malone, but because she was crying, she twice\n\naccidentally bit his penis. This made Malone angry, which resulted\n\nin him beating and raping her.\n\n     K.M. testified regarding another sexual assault, one almost\n\ndiscovered by Brenda.    That time, Malone thought that Brenda had\n\nleft the house and ordered K.M. to perform oral sex on him, with\n\nwhich she complied.     Brenda, however, was having car trouble and\n\nreturned to the house.     Brenda entered her and Malone's bedroom,\n\n\n                                 - 6 -\n\fand K.M. jumped up and her father quickly covered himself.      Her\n\nmother asked what was going on, but both denied anything untoward.\n\n     In around October 1998, K.M., Brenda, and Whitney moved in\n\nwith an aunt and her family. K.M. testified about another assault,\n\nwhich, according to K.M.'s testimony, occurred on Christmas Day\n\n1998.   On that day, K.M. was opening presents and playing with her\n\nsister when Brenda informed K.M. that her father was coming to pick\n\nup her and Whitney. K.M. protested, telling her mother that she\n\ndidn't want to go.   She cried and begged her mother not to make her\n\ngo with her father, but Brenda denied her pleadings.    When Malone\n\npicked her up, he confronted his daughter about her apprehension\n\nabout seeing him.    He was angry, grabbed her, hit her in the face,\n\nand smashed her head against the car window.    Once at her uncle's\n\nhouse, Malone told Whitney to leave him and K.M. alone.      Malone\n\nagain demanded oral sex, with which K.M. complied, after which he\n\nraped her.\n\n     K.M. testified to other assaults, which included the playing\n\nand viewing of pornographic videos while Malone received oral sex\n\nfrom K.M., raped her, or both.     K.M. testified that she had seen\n\npornographic tapes with her father on seven or eight occasions, and\n\nthat, all told, he had assaulted her \"many times.\"\n\n     Finally, K.M. testified about the events of July 20, 1999.\n\nAfter the argument in which Brenda informed Malone of her desire to\n\nhave him leave the home, Malone called his daughters from their\n\n\n                                - 7 -\n\fbedrooms.    He took them to Friendly's Restaurant to \"sa[y] good-\n\nbye.\"    Once there, Malone gave Whitney some money to get something\n\nto eat in the restaurant, but Malone and K.M. stayed in the car.\n\nMalone asked K.M. if she was going to tell Brenda about the sexual\n\nabuse.    K.M. told him that she was indeed going to tell Brenda.\n\nMalone responded to this by offering to give his pager to K.M. if\n\nshe would remain quiet for at least twenty-four hours.      He then\n\nasked whether she would remain quiet for three weeks if he gave her\n\nhis cell phone.     Then he offered to give her $3,000 every three\n\nmonths for the rest of her life if she agreed to remain silent.\n\nK.M. took the pager and cell phone and then went home.     At home,\n\nshe told her mother that Malone had been raping her for almost four\n\nand a half years.\n\n     On cross-examination, Malone's counsel sought to establish\n\nthat K.M. had animus toward Malone because he was, in the words of\n\nthe defense, a \"strict disciplinarian.\"    In an effort to undermine\n\nK.M.'s credibility, defense counsel also focused on inconsistencies\n\nor omissions between K.M.'s trial testimony and the statements she\n\nmade to Officer Gomsey, as those statements were recorded in\n\nGomsey's two police reports.     Gomsey's reports were not entered\n\ninto evidence, but defense counsel used the reports to refresh\n\nK.M.'s memory when, during her testimony, she expressed uncertainty\n\nabout the contents of the reports or when her testimony was\n\ninconsistent with the statements that she had made to Gomsey.\n\n\n                                - 8 -\n\f     K.M., according to defense counsel, had told Gomsey that Tony\n\nnever came home during an assault, yet she testified that Tony came\n\nhome during one of the assaults. On cross-examination, K.M. denied\n\ntelling Gomsey that Tony came home while Malone was committing a\n\nsexual assault, but testified that she told Gomsey that he came\n\nhome during a physical assault.      Defense counsel questioned K.M.\n\nabout whether she had told Gomsey that the Christmas assault had in\n\nfact occurred the day after Christmas.    K.M. acknowledged that she\n\nwas \"not good with remembering exactly what [she] said,\" but\n\ninsisted that she did not remember telling Gomsey that the sexual\n\nassault had occurred the day after Christmas.     Counsel challenged\n\nK.M.'s testimony that Malone was unclothed when Brenda walked in on\n\nthem; she testified on cross that she didn't remember whether she\n\ntold Gomsey that Malone was unclothed.       After viewing Gomsey's\n\nreport to refresh her memory, K.M. then denied telling Gomsey that\n\nMalone was clothed.\n\n     Defense counsel further challenged K.M. with Gomsey's report.\n\nK.M., in her direct testimony, stated that Malone had given her his\n\npager for one day of silence and his cell phone for three weeks of\n\nsilence, but Gomsey's police report stated that K.M. said that\n\nMalone offered K.M. the pager for one week of silence and the cell\n\nphone for three months of silence.    During cross-examination, K.M.\n\ndenied telling Gomsey anything inconsistent with her testimony in\n\nthis regard.\n\n\n                              - 9 -\n\f      The   defense    challenged    K.M.   with   other   omissions   or\n\ninconsistencies.      K.M., on direct, testified that Malone promised\n\nher $3,000 every three months if she kept quiet forever, although\n\nthere was no mention of the $3,000 payments in Gomsey's two\n\nreports.    During cross-examination, K.M. testified that she did\n\ntell Gomsey about the $3,000.       K.M. testified that during the very\n\nfirst incident of sexual abuse a pornographic tape was playing;\n\nGomsey's reports fail to mention the pornographic tape.           During\n\ncross-examination, K.M. again testified that a pornographic tape\n\nhad been playing during the first incident, and she insisted that\n\nshe had told Gomsey about it.\n\n      After K.M. finished testifying, the Commonwealth revealed that\n\ntheir second witness, Brenda, would be their only fresh-complaint\n\nwitness.2 Although the Commonwealth listed several fresh complaint\n\nwitnesses, including Gomsey, at a pretrial hearing, the trial judge\n\n\n\n\n  2\n     Under Massachusetts law at the time of Malone's trial, the\n\"fresh complaint\" doctrine provided \"an exception to the usual rule\nthat a prior statement of a witness that is merely repetitive of\nthe witness's trial testimony is not admissible except in limited\ncircumstances, such as on redirect examination to rehabilitate the\nwitness after impeachment on a claim of recent contrivance.\" See\nCommonwealth v. King, 834 N.E.2d 1175, 1187–90 (Mass. 2005)\n(discussing the history and application of the fresh complaint\ndoctrine).   The doctrine allows the prosecution to rebut any\ninference that the alleged victim of a sexual assault is\nfabricating evidence by allowing evidence from a \"fresh complaint\"\nwitness that the victim did, in fact, complain while the assault\nwas still \"fresh.\"\n\n                                 - 10 -\n\flimited the Commonwealth's fresh complaint witnesses to one.3\n\n     Brenda, as the fresh complaint witness, testified about K.M.\n\ntelling her that Malone had been raping her for four and a half\n\nyears.   Brenda testified that K.M. had told her that Malone \"was\n\nmaking her have sex with him.\"\n\n     In addition to serving as the fresh complaint witness, Brenda\n\ntestified to two events which supported K.M.'s testimony.    First,\n\nBrenda testified that she had in fact come into her bedroom and saw\n\nMalone and K.M. in bed together and that the instant she opened the\n\ndoor, K.M. jumped out of bed.     Brenda testified that K.M. denied\n\nthat anything improper was taking place.   Second, Brenda testified\n\nthat on another occasion she had come home from work and entered\n\nher bedroom to find Malone holding a belt and standing over K.M.,\n\nwho was bent over crying and completely unclothed with a pair of\n\n\n\n\n 3\n     At the time of Malone's trial it was generally a trial judge's\npractice to limit the number of fresh complaint witnesses, but the\njudge had the discretion to allow more than one fresh complaint\nwitness.     However, in King, 834 N.E.2d at 1197–98, the\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") adopted a fresh\ncomplaint rule that now, as a general matter, limits such testimony\nto one witness — the first person told of the assault, see id. at\n1198 (allowing a judge, in limited circumstances, to permit the\ntestimony of a fresh complaint witness who was not the first person\ntold of the assault where, for example, the \"first person told of\nthe alleged assault is unavailable, incompetent, or too young to\ntestify meaningfully\").    The changes in the Massachusetts fresh\ncomplaint doctrine apply prospectively to only those sexual assault\ncases tried after the issuance of the opinion. See id. at 1201.\nMalone's trial occurred prior to King's one fresh complaint witness\nrule.\n\n                                - 11 -\n\fsocks stuffed in her mouth.4   Brenda testified that when she asked\n\nMalone why he was spanking K.M. completely naked and why K.M. had\n\na sock in her mouth, Malone stated that the sock was necessary to\n\nkeep K.M. from screaming. After Brenda testified, the first day of\n\nthe trial concluded.\n\n     On the second morning of the trial, defense counsel requested\n\na continuance to serve Officer Gomsey with a subpoena to appear and\n\ntestify as a defense witness.     Defense counsel explained that he\n\nthought that the Commonwealth was going to call Gomsey as a fresh\n\ncomplaint witness in its case-in-chief and therefore failed to\n\nserve her with a subpoena.      The court denied the continuance,\n\nconcluding that the fresh complaint witnesses had been limited to\n\none and it was apparent at the close of the previous day's\n\nproceedings that the Commonwealth was not going to call Gomsey.\n\n     Following   that,   the   Commonwealth   called   Whitney,   who\n\ncorroborated some of K.M.'s testimony regarding what happened at\n\nFriendly's.   Whitney also testified to seeing bruises on K.M.'s\n\nthighs, and seeing the door closed on the bedroom while K.M. and\n\nMalone were inside. The Commonwealth then rested. Defense counsel\n\nrenewed his request for a continuance to subpoena Gomsey, but the\n\ntrial judge again denied the request.\n\n\n\n 4\n     Brenda also testified about other physical abuse, stating that\nshe had seen bruises on K.M.'s thighs and buttocks, and had\nwitnessed Malone hitting K.M. with a belt.\n\n\n                                - 12 -\n\f      The defense called Malone's mother Kelli, who testified to\n\nconversations she had with Malone about moving to Michigan, and\n\nthen the defense called Malone himself.              Malone acknowledged that,\n\nin   his   words,   he   \"disciplined\"       K.M.    with    \"whoopings,\"      which\n\nincluded    beatings     with   a   belt,    but    denied   having    any   sexual\n\nrelations with his daughter.             Malone also testified to K.M.'s\n\nanimosity    toward      him,    which      he   believed     flowed    from    his\n\n\"disciplin[ing]\" ways.          On cross-examination, Malone admitted to\n\nbeating his naked daughter while she had socks stuffed in her\n\nmouth, as well as to other physical assaults.                    With that, the\n\ndefense rested.\n\n      Defense counsel then made an offer of proof, describing the\n\neight alleged inconsistencies that would have been brought to light\n\nhad he been allowed to subpoena Gomsey: (1) K.M. testified that\n\nTony came home during a sexual and physical assault that occurred\n\nwhile she was living at her Uncle Tony's house, whereas Gomsey's\n\nreport states that Uncle Tony came home during an incident in which\n\nMalone was \"beating\" K.M.; (2) K.M. testified that she had been\n\nraped and assaulted by Malone on Christmas Day 1998, whereas the\n\nreport stated that K.M. had only been physically assaulted on that\n\noccasion; (3) regarding the incident where Brenda nearly caught\n\nMalone and K.M. in a sexual act, K.M. testified that Malone was\n\nunclothed when her mother walked in on K.M and Malone, whereas the\n\nreport stated that Malone was clothed during this incident; (4)\n\n\n                                     - 13 -\n\fK.M. testified that Malone had given her his pager for one day of\n\nsilence and his cell phone for three weeks of silence, whereas the\n\nreport stated that Malone offered K.M. the pager for one week of\n\nsilence and the cell phone for three months of silence; (5) K.M.\n\ntestified that Malone promised her $3,000 every three months if she\n\nkept quiet forever, whereas the reports do not mention the $3,000;\n\n(6) K.M. testified that during the very first incident of sexual\n\nabuse a pornographic tape was playing, whereas the reports fail to\n\nmention the pornographic tape; (7) K.M. testified that Malone\n\nthreatened her after the first incident of sexual abuse, whereas\n\nthe reports fail to mention any threats made by Malone after the\n\nfirst sexual assault; and (8) K.M. testified that Malone made her\n\n\"earn\" a limousine ride for her twelfth birthday by performing oral\n\nsex and having sexual intercourse, whereas the reports fail to\n\nmention the limousine incident.5\n\n\n\n  5\n     On appeal, Malone provides two additional inconsistencies,\nwhich were not included in defense counsel's offer of proof, that\ncould have been explored had Gomsey testified:\n\n      (1) During cross-examination, K.M. denied ever reporting to\n      Gomsey that Malone had ripped off her clothes during an\n      incident at Uncle Tony's house, whereas the report stated that\n      during the incident that occurred when Uncle Tony came home,\n      Malone choked K.M. and began to rip off her clothes.\n\n      (2) Gomsey's report stated that K.M.'s school had called the\n      house because she had detention and because her progress\n      report was bad. According to the report, Malone offered K.M.\n      a chance to \"redeem herself\" by performing oral sex. During\n      cross-examination, K.M. denied telling Gomsey that the\n      progress report and detention occurred at the same time.\n\n                               - 14 -\n\f     After presenting his offer of proof, defense counsel admitted\n\nto the court that his failure to subpoena Gomsey was not a\n\nstrategic decision but a \"mistake.\"           The trial court responded to\n\ncounsel's remark:\n\n     I don't think you necessarily made a mistake; I think you\n     obtained from the complaining witness the inconsistencies\n     that were described to the officer, without permitting\n     the officer to testify as to everything else that was\n     told, because as I understand the doctrine, simply\n     because someone makes an inconsistent statement, unless\n     there's an accusation of recent contrivance, it doesn't\n     make all other consistent statements admissible. So you\n     got the best of both worlds. So I don't see where you\n     made any mistake.\n\n     Malone was found guilty of three counts of rape and abuse of\n\na child under sixteen and one count of indecent assault and battery\n\non a child under fourteen.        Malone appealed and, while his direct\n\nappeal was pending, he filed a motion for a new trial in the\n\nSuperior Court.    In the motion, Malone argued, among other things,\n\nthat his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to serve Gomsey\n\nwith a subpoena to compel her presence at trial.              Malone's motion\n\nfor a new trial was denied by the Superior Court.\n\n     In his consolidated appeal to the Massachusetts Appeals Court,\n\nMalone raised the same ineffectiveness claim that had been rejected\n\nin his motion for a new trial.      The Appeals Court affirmed Malone's\n\nconviction   and   the   denial    of   his    motion   for    a   new   trial.\n\nCommonwealth v. Malone, 780 N.E.2d 489, 2002 WL 31890964, at **1 -\n\n**2 (Mass. App. Ct. 2002) (unpublished table decision). That court\n\nheld that Malone was not denied effective assistance of counsel,\n\n                                   - 15 -\n\freasoning   that   the   absence    of    Gomsey's   testimony   was   \"not\n\nsignificantly prejudicial\" because she would have only provided\n\n\"cumulative impeachment testimony.\"          Malone, 2002 WL 31890964, at\n\n*1.   Malone then filed an Application for Leave to Obtain Further\n\nAppellate Review with the SJC, which was summarily denied.             See\n\nCommonwealth v. Malone, 843 N.E.2d 638 (Mass. 2006) (unpublished\n\ntable decision).\n\n      Following the SJC's denial of further appellate review, Malone\n\nfiled a federal habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254.           The\n\ndistrict court denied the petition, but granted a certificate of\n\nappealability on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n\n                                    II.\n\n      We review the district court's denial of habeas corpus relief\n\nde novo.    Teti v. Bender, 507 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2007), cert.\n\ndenied, 128 S. Ct. 1719 (2008).             The district court's factual\n\nfindings are reviewed for clear error, while mixed questions of law\n\nand fact are reviewed de novo.       Norton v.

Ineffective assistance of counsel claims\n\nare mixed questions of law and fact. Strickland v. Washington, 466\n\nU.S. 668, 698 (1984).\n\n      This case is governed by the standards of review established\n\nby the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n\n(\"AEDPA\"), 28 U.S.C. § 2254, and the \"well-established Strickland\n\n\n                                   - 16 -\n\ftest for ineffective assistance of counsel claims,\" Sleeper v.\n\nSpencer, 510 F.3d 32, 37 (1st Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct.\n\n2915 (2008) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687).                     We briefly\n\nreview the governing law before turning to the merits of Malone's\n\nclaim.\n\n      A.      AEDPA\n\n      Under    the    AEDPA,   to   be   entitled   to   relief,     Malone    must\n\ndemonstrate that the state court's resolution of his ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim \"resulted in a decision that was\n\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application, of clearly\n\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\n\nUnited States.\"        28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1); Rompilla v. Beard, 545\n\nU.S. 374, 380 (2005).\n\n      A state court decision is \"contrary to\" the Supreme Court's\n\nclearly established precedents if (1) the state court applies\n\neither a legal rule that contradicts an established Supreme Court\n\nprecedent or (2) reaches a different result on facts materially\n\nindistinguishable       from   those     of   a   controlling    Supreme      Court\n\nprecedent.      Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405-06 (2000).\n\n      The applicable precedent in this case is the well-known two-\n\nprong    standard     articulated    in    Strickland,    466    U.S.   at     687.\n\nAlthough   the    state   court6    failed    specifically      to   mention    the\n\n\n  6\n     The highest state court, the SJC, summarily denied Malone's\nhabeas claim, see Malone, 843 N.E.2d 638, therefore, we \"look\n                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                     - 17 -\n\fStrickland standard, applying instead Massachusetts's standard\n\narticulated in Commonwealth v. Saferian, 315 N.E.2d 878, 883 (Mass.\n\n1974), we have held that \"for habeas purposes, Saferian is a\n\nfunctional equivalent of Strickland,\" Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d\n\n19, 32 (1st Cir. 2002).7          Thus, the state court did not apply a\n\nlegal rule that contradicts an established Supreme Court precedent.\n\nSee Williams, 529 U.S. at 405.\n\n       Additionally, this case does not fall under the \"contrary to\"\n\ncategory of the AEDPA.       Although the Supreme Court has addressed a\n\nwide-variety of ineffective assistance of counsel cases, petitioner\n\nhas pointed us to no Supreme Court case reaching a different result\n\nthan   the   state   court   in    the   this   case   involving   materially\n\nindistinguishable facts, nor have we found such a case.\n\n\n\n  6\n   (...continued)\nthrough\" to \"the last reasoned decision,\" which is the decision of\nthe Massachusetts Appeals Court. Gunter v. Maloney, 291 F.3d 74,\n80 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U.S. 797, 804\n(1991)).\n  7\n     Under Saferian, the petitioner \"must demonstrate that there\n'has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of\ncounsel -- behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which\nmight be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,'\" and if that\nis found, the petitioner \"must show that such behavior 'has likely\ndeprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial\nground of defence.'\" Commonwealth v. Sargent, 870 N.E.2d 602, 610\n(Mass. 2007) (quoting Saferian, 315 N.E.2d at 883).        We have\nconcluded that Saferian's \"depriving the defendant of an otherwise\navailable   substantial   ground   of  defense\"   prong   subsumes\nStrickland's prejudice prong. See Ouber, 293 F.3d at 32 (\"[T]he\nSJC has concluded that Saferian is at least as solicitous of Sixth\nAmendment rights as Strickland.\"); accord Stephens v. Hall, 294\nF.3d 210, 214-15 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                    - 18 -\n\f     \"AEDPA[, however,] 'does not require state and federal courts\n\nto wait for some nearly identical factual pattern before a legal\n\nrule must be applied.'\"     Panetti v. Quaterman, 127 S. Ct. 2842,\n\n2858 (2007) (quoting Carey v. Musladin, 127 S. Ct. 649, 657 (2006)\n\n(Kennedy, J., concurring)).        Malone also would be entitled to\n\nrelief if he shows that the state court unreasonably applied\n\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt.    See   Rompilla,   545   U.S.     at   380.   An   \"unreasonable\n\napplication\" of federal law occurs when the state court identifies\n\nthe correct legal principle, \"but (i) applies those principles to\n\nthe facts of the case in an objectively unreasonable manner; (ii)\n\nunreasonably extends clearly established legal principles to a new\n\ncontext where they should not apply; or (iii) unreasonably refuses\n\nto extend established principles to a new context where they should\n\napply.\"   Sleeper, 510 F.3d at 38 (citing L'Abbe v. DiPaolo, 311\n\nF.3d 93, 96 (1st Cir. 2002)).\n\n     Neither (ii) nor (iii) applies in this case -- Malone is not\n\narguing that the state unreasonably extended Strickland to a new\n\ncontext or that the state court unreasonably refused to extend\n\nStrickland to a new context.        Thus, the question before us is\n\nwhether the state court applied the principles of Strickland to the\n\nfacts in Malone's case in an objectively unreasonable manner, to\n\nwhich we turn next.\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 19 -\n\f     B.      Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n     To be entitled to relief for constitutionally ineffective\n\nassistance,    under      Strickland,    Malone      must   show    (1)    deficient\n\nperformance by counsel (2) resulting in prejudice.                  Rompilla, 545\n\nU.S. at 380 (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687).\n\n     While Malone must prove both prongs to prevail, we have held\n\nthat \"a reviewing court need not address both requirements if the\n\nevidence as to either is lacking.\"            Sleeper, 510 F.3d at 39.           That\n\nis, \"[i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on\n\nthe ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will\n\noften   be   so,   that    course   should     be    followed.\"       Id.   (citing\n\nStrickland, 466 at 697).        That is the course we follow here.\n\n     C.      Malone Suffered No Prejudice\n\n     The     prejudice     prong    requires     Malone     to     demonstrate    \"a\n\nreasonable    probability     that,     but    for   counsel's      unprofessional\n\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694.              A reasonable probability is a\n\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. Id.\n\n\"The assessment of prejudice should proceed on the assumption that\n\nthe decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially\n\napplying the standards that govern the decision.\"                     Id. at 695.\n\n\"[A] court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the\n\ntotality of the evidence before the judge or jury.\"                  Id.\n\n     Malone argues that the state court's application of Strickland\n\n\n                                      - 20 -\n\fwas unreasonable because he was prejudiced by defense counsel's\n\nfailure to subpoena Gomsey.     To Malone, Gomsey was the \"sole\n\nwitness capable of discrediting the alleged victim's testimony.\"\n\nMalone argues, correctly, that in a case such as this, where the\n\nCommonwealth's presentation of physical evidence was limited, the\n\ncredibility of the victim is particularly important.   Given that,\n\nMalone argues that trial counsel's failure to insure Gomsey's\n\npresence at trial \"crippled\" the defense's ability to impeach\n\nK.M.'s credibility.   Malone argues, \"[t]he outcome of the trial\n\nmight have well been different had the defense lawyer presented the\n\nprior inconsistent statements of the alleged victim through Officer\n\nGomsey.\"   Appellant's Br. at 19-20.\n\n      Malone, however, must show more.     His burden is not to\n\ndemonstrate that the outcome \"might\" have been different, but to\n\ndemonstrate \"a probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional\n\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n\nStrickland, 466 at 694.    Not only must Malone demonstrate that\n\ncounsel's failure undermines our confidence in the outcome, see\n\nStrickland, 466 at 694, but he must also demonstrate that the state\n\ncourt applied Strickland's prejudice principles to the facts of the\n\ncase in an objectively unreasonable manner, Sleeper, 510 F.3d at\n\n38.\n\n      We have recognized that \"where the relevant error is failure\n\nto impeach a government witness, we begin by assessing the strength\n\n\n                              - 21 -\n\fof the prosecution's case, and the effectiveness of the defense\n\nabsent the impeachment evidence.\"   Stephens v. Hall, 294 F.3d 210,\n\n218 (1st Cir. 2002).   We then consider \"'the potential impeachment\n\nvalue' of the evidence 'in undermining the credibility of the\n\nwitness's testimony.'\"    Id. (quoting Gonzalez-Soberal v. United\n\nStates, 244 F.3d 273, 278 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\n          1.   The Strength of the Prosecution's Case\n\n     K.M.'s credibility was central to the prosecution's case. The\n\nCommonwealth presented no physical evidence.      The parties did,\n\nhowever, stipulate that Brenda had delivered three videotapes\n\ncontaining pornographic scenes to the Yarmouth Police and that\n\nthose tapes came from the home in which Malone resided.   Brenda and\n\nWhitney did not testify to seeing sexual abuse, only physical\n\nabuse. Brenda testified to (1) seeing bruises on K.M.'s thighs and\n\nbuttocks, (2) Malone hitting K.M. and Whitney clothed and unclothed\n\nwith a belt, (3) walking in on Malone and K.M. lying on a bed and\n\nK.M. suddenly \"jumping,\" and, (4) walking in on Malone beating a\n\nnaked K.M. with a belt while she had a sock stuffed in her mouth.\n\nWhitney testified to (1) seeing bruises on K.M.'s thighs and (2)\n\nseeing the door closed on Malone's bedroom while K.M. and Malone\n\nwere inside. Malone admitted to hitting his daughters, clothed and\n\nunclothed, with his hand and belt, and he admitted that he beat a\n\nnaked K.M. with a belt while a sock was stuffed in her mouth.\n\nMalone, however, denied all allegations of sexual abuse.         In\n\n\n                               - 22 -\n\fessence then, the case turned on whether the jury believed K.M.'s\n\ntestimony of sexual abuse.\n\n     Even based on our review of the cold record, it is clear to us\n\nthat K.M.'s testimony provided a vivid and descriptive account of\n\nyears of sexual abuse by her father.   The jury was able to observe\n\nK.M. as she recited the times in which her father allowed her to\n\n\"redeem herself\" by performing oral sex on him or by allowing him\n\nto have intercourse with her.      The jury saw her face as she\n\ndescribed the \"favors\" her father asked her to do.   The jury heard\n\nK.M. testify that her father had cuffed her in the head, saying\n\n\"Don't bite my shit,\" when she accidentally bit his penis.     The\n\njury heard her describe the beatings and the accounts of oral sex\n\nperformed upon her father while pornographic movies were playing in\n\nthe background.    And the jury decided that with regard to the\n\ncentral question before it -- whether Malone had raped and sexually\n\nassaulted his daughter -- K.M., and not Malone, was believable.\n\n     The jury decided that K.M. was credible even though it was\n\nabundantly clear that K.M. had provided varying accounts as to some\n\nof the details of the assaults.   Defense counsel highlighted many\n\nof these inconsistencies through cross-examination of K.M., Brenda,\n\nand Whitney.   Indeed, of the eight \"inconsistencies\" that defense\n\ncounsel listed in his offer of proof, defense counsel highlighted\n\nall but one of the inconsistencies on cross-examination.\n\n\n\n\n                              - 23 -\n\f          2.    The Effectiveness of the Defense and the Potential\n                Impeachment Value of Gomsey's Testimony\n\n     Malone contends that Gomsey's testimony would have impeached\n\nK.M. because Gomsey would have testified that K.M.'s testimony was\n\ninconsistent with what K.M. told Gomsey.     Defense counsel did,\n\nhowever, effectively attack K.M. with all but one of the alleged\n\ninconsistencies that Malone contends would have come out had Gomsey\n\ntestified.     Defense counsel confronted K.M. with the reports'\n\nstatements that: (1) Tony never came home during a sexual assault,\n\neven though K.M. testified that Tony came home during a physical\n\nassault; (2) K.M. was physically assaulted, and not sexually\n\nassaulted, on Christmas Day 1998, and during cross-examination K.M.\n\nadmitted that she had only reported the physical abuse to Gomsey;\n\n(3) Malone was clothed during the incident in which Brenda came\n\nhome and nearly caught K.M. and Malone in a sexual act, and when\n\nconfronted with this on cross-examination, K.M. denied telling\n\nGomsey that Malone was clothed; and (4) Malone had offered the\n\npager for one week of silence and the cell phone for three months\n\nof silence, and not one day and three weeks, respectively, as K.M.\n\ntestified, and on cross-examination, K.M. denied telling Gomsey\n\nabout her father's offer.    Defense counsel also confronted K.M.\n\nregarding events to which she testified that were omitted from\n\nGomsey's reports.    The reports fail to mention that (5) Malone\n\noffered to pay $3,000 every three months in exchange for K.M.'s\n\npermanent silence, but K.M. insisted on cross-examination that she\n\n                              - 24 -\n\fdid tell Gomsey about the $3,000; (6) a pornographic tape was\n\nplaying during the first sexual assault, but K.M., on cross-\n\nexamination, insisted that such a tape was playing during the\n\nassault and that she had told Gomsey about it; and (7) Malone\n\nthreatened to kill K.M. after the first incident of sexual abuse,\n\nwhereas K.M. testified on cross-examination that she \"made sure\"\n\nthat Gomsey knew about the threat after the first incident.   Of all\n\nthe \"inconsistencies\" listed by the defense counsel in his offer of\n\nproof, only (8) was not touched upon at all during K.M.'s cross\n\nexamination: the report's failure to mention that Malone made K.M.\n\n\"earn\" her limousine ride by performing oral sex and having sexual\n\nintercourse with him; counsel failed to question K.M. about that\n\nomission on cross-examination.8\n\n     Additional inconsistencies in K.M.'s trial testimony also were\n\nhighlighted through the testimony and cross-examination of Brenda\n\nand Whitney.   Brenda testified that K.M. had told her that Malone\n\nhad told K.M. to wait at least three months before telling Brenda\n\nabout the abuse, whereas K.M. testified that her father had given\n\n\n\n 8\n     Even the two additional inconsistencies that Malone raises for\nthe first time on appeal were addressed at trial. Malone's counsel\nasked K.M. whether she had told Gomsey that her father began to rip\noff her clothes during the assault in which Tony came home, and\nK.M. denied telling that to Gomsey.          Defense counsel also\nquestioned K.M. about whether K.M. had told Gomsey that Malone's\noffer to \"redeem herself\" was in connection with the school calling\nhome because K.M. had received detention and an unfavorable\nprogress report, and K.M. denied telling Gomsey that the progress\nreport and detention occurred at the same time.\n\n                              - 25 -\n\fher his pager for one day of silence and his cell phone for three\n\nweeks    of     silence.        (Gomsey's      report       comports      with   Brenda's\n\ntestimony, stating that Malone had promised K.M. his cell phone for\n\n\"three    months       of    silence.\")           Brenda    also    contradicted       her\n\ndaughter's testimony regarding details in connection with the\n\nsexual assault that occurred after K.M. stayed out too late and\n\nMalone \"offered\" her the chance to \"redeem herself\": K.M. testified\n\nthat her father picked her up when she was out late one night,\n\nwhereas Brenda testified that K.M.'s friend's mother picked up K.M.\n\n     K.M.'s younger sister's testimony was also inconsistent with\n\nK.M.'s testimony in some respects.                    Whitney testified that she\n\nremembered seeing her father the day after Christmas 1998, whereas\n\nK.M. testified that her father raped her on Christmas Day 1998.\n\nEven after reviewing Gomsey's report to refresh her recollection,\n\nK.M. stated that she did not remember telling Gomsey it was the day\n\nafter Christmas.            (Gomsey's report states that an incident with\n\nK.M. and Malone occurred \"[t]he day after Christmas 1998 or near\n\nthat time.\")\n\n     Defense counsel even extracted an admission from K.M. that the\n\ndetails of her stories were not always consistent.                           When asked\n\nabout    what    she    said    during      her    interviews      with    Gomsey,     K.M.\n\nadmitted      that     she     \"was   not    too     good    with    memory,\"     or    at\n\n\"remembering exactly what she said.\"\n\n     The defense was sufficiently effective in challenging K.M.'s\n\n\n                                         - 26 -\n\fcredibility based upon her inconsistencies that the prosecution\n\nfelt compelled to address directly K.M.'s credibility in its\n\nclosing    argument.      The    prosecutor      acknowledged    that   K.M.'s\n\ntestimony concerning various details was not always consistent, and\n\nargued that\n\n       for us to sit here in judgment and to say, [\"]You don't\n       know the exact dates and times, you don't know how you've\n       gotten to the car or who picked you up from a certain\n       time and place[\"] is not reasonable.       It's not even\n       logical. It doesn't even make common sense, to think\n       that she would be able to decipher between each and every\n       time that this man raped her[.]\n\nThe jury knew full well that K.M. had told inconsistent stories\n\nregarding various details of the rapes. K.M., the defense, and the\n\nprosecution all acknowledged as much to the jury.\n\n            3.     The Totality of the Evidence\n\n       After reviewing the totality of the evidence before the jury,\n\nwe conclude that the potential impeachment value of Gomsey's\n\ntestimony     would    not   have     significantly     undermined      K.M.'s\n\ncredibility.      Although we have noted that \"a significant factor\n\nweighing in favor of finding prejudice is the absence of any\n\ncorroborating evidence other than the testimony of the witness whom\n\ndefense counsel failed to impeach,\" Stephens, 294 F.3d at 225\n\n(citing Gonzalez-Soberal, 244 F.3d at 278), here, defense counsel\n\ndid not fail to impeach K.M.        And the jury was repeatedly presented\n\nwith   K.M.'s    inconsistent    statements,     inconsistencies    that   the\n\nprosecution      acknowledged.      The   jury    nevertheless    found    K.M.\n\n\n                                    - 27 -\n\fcredible regarding the allegations of sexual abuse.\n\n      Moreover, calling Gomsey to testify would have come with a\n\nprice.      Gomsey's report states that she knew K.M. through working\n\nat K.M.'s middle school and that she \"kn[e]w [K.M.] to be a good\n\nperson and to my knowledge had always been truthful with me.\"             As\n\nthe state court noted, given that \"Officer Gomsey's potential\n\ntestimony would have been cumulative of testimony already in\n\nevidence,\" Malone may well have benefitted from her absence.             See\n\nMalone, 2002 WL 31890964, at *1.       That is, as the trial judge told\n\nMalone's counsel, and the state appellate court quoted approvingly,\n\nMalone \"obtained from the complaining witness the inconsistencies\n\nthat were described to the officer, without permitting the officer\n\nto testify as to everything else that was told[.]\" See id.\n\n      Therefore, we conclude that the state court's decision that\n\nMalone was not prejudiced by his counsel's failure to call Gomsey\n\nwas   not    an   unreasonable    application    of   Strickland.      While\n\nunreasonableness      may,   at   times,    be   \"difficult   to    define,\"\n\nMcCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d 24, 36 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc), we\n\nhave no difficulty in concluding in this case that the state court\n\ndid not commit AEDPA error.       We cannot say that the state court's\n\ndecision was unreasonable in the independent and objective judgment\n\nof this court.     In fact, we agree with the state court.          Gomsey's\n\nfailure to testify does not undermine our confidence in the outcome\n\nof Malone's trial.\n\n\n                                   - 28 -\n\f                                       III.\n\n     Because    the   state    court    did   not    unreasonably   apply   the\n\nStrickland     standard   to    the     facts       of   Malone's   case,   its\n\ndetermination that Malone was not prejudiced by his counsel's\n\nfailure to subpoena Gomsey was not error under the AEDPA.\n\n     The district court's denial of Malone's habeas petition is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 29 -\n\f",

Badway, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau, with whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General of Massachusetts, was on brief for respondent-appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, TASHIMA,<sup>[**]</sup> Circuit Judge, and LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>TASHIMA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Gerald Malone was convicted in Massachusetts Superior Court of rape and abuse of a child under sixteen, and indecent assault and battery of a child under fourteen, based on a series of sexual assaults that he committed against his daughter when she was between the ages of eleven and fourteen. After exhausting his state court remedies, Malone petitioned for federal habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254. Malone alleged that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failure to subpoena a police officer who could have impeached the testimony of his daughter, who we refer to as \"K.M.,\" the principal witness against him. The district court denied the petition. Because we conclude that the Massachusetts Appeals Court's decision that Malone suffered no prejudice from his counsel's failure to subpoena the witness was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, we affirm the district court's denial of Malone's habeas petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Brenda and Gerald Malone were married and have two children together, \"K.M.\" and Whitney. On July 20, 1999, as they often did, Gerald and Brenda argued. Following the argument on this occasion, however, Brenda informed Gerald Malone (\"Malone\") that she no longer wanted to be his wife, that she had consulted with a divorce attorney, and that she wanted him to move out of their house. After Malone packed his belongings and left the house, K.M. told her mother that her father had been raping her for nearly four and a half years.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing this, Brenda took K.M. to the South Yarmouth Police Department. There, K.M. was interviewed by Officer Cheryl Nugent Gomsey. Gomsey prepared an initial report which contained K.M.'s statements regarding her father's sexual assaults. On October 26, 1999, Gomsey conducted a follow-up interview and prepared an additional report. In August 1999, Malone was indicted on charges of raping and assaulting K.M.</p>\n<p>At trial, the Commonwealth's case consisted of the testimony of K.M., her younger sister Whitney, and Brenda. K.M. was the main witness and she provided a vivid account of years of repeated rapes and sexual assaults by her father.<sup>[1]</sup> K.M. began with the first incident (which occurred in 1995), telling the jury that when she was 11 years old, her father called her into her mother's bedroom-Malone and Brenda lived apart at that time, but Malone regularly visited  and asked K.M. if she could \"do him a favor.\" K.M. testified that Malone was lying on the bed and a pornographic movie was playing on the television. He pulled the covers off of himself, exposing his naked body to his daughter. Malone, referring to his penis, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> told K.M. that he needed her to \"suck this\" for him. K.M. did as she was told, but while performing fellatio, she accidentally bit Malone's penis. Malone hit her on the head, telling her \"Don't bite my shit again.\" K.M. continued performing oral sex until Malone ejaculated.</p>\n<p>K.M. testified about other assaults. The second occurred about a week or two after the first. K.M. testified that she came home from school, and Malone was sitting in the living room. Upon hearing his daughter come home, he called for her. Malone asked her, \"Remember that favor I asked you to do a long time ago?\" K.M. remembered, but said, \"I thought I didn't have to do this anymore, Daddy.\" To this Malone responded, \"I changed my mind.\" Being afraid, K.M. said okay. Malone unzipped his pants, removed his penis, and ordered K.M. to perform oral sex on him, which she did.</p>\n<p>K.M. testified to another assault which occurred shortly before her twelfth birthday. This time, Malone called K.M. into her mother's bedroom. Malone reminded her of their family \"tradition\" of renting a limousine for the children's twelfth birthdays-Malone had rented a limousine for K.M.'s older sister (who we gather is not Malone's child) when she turned 12 and, at that time, he told the other two children that they would get the same thing on their twelfth birthdays. In the bedroom, however, Malone told K.M. that if she wanted her limousine she would \"have to earn it.\" K.M. testified that she understood what her father had in mind. He offered to let her \"do it\" after her birthday, but K.M. said no, preferring to \"do it\" then. Malone ordered her to take off all her clothes and perform oral sex on him. Malone then performed oral sex on her and had intercourse with her.</p>\n<p>In June 1997, Brenda and Malone married, and, a few months before the wedding, Malone moved in with Brenda, K.M., and Whitney. K.M. testified to another sexual assault which occurred during this period. This assault occurred after K.M. had gotten into trouble for being out too late. According to K.M., Malone picked her up and drove her back home. Once they returned home, Brenda \"started hollering and screaming at\" her. Malone and Brenda quarreled for a time, with Malone telling Brenda to leave K.M. alone. Malone and K.M. eventually left in his car. In the car, Malone told her that she could \"redeem\" herself, saying that she had the chance to get out of trouble. They drove off, and, while Malone was driving, he unzipped his pants and said, \"Here.\" K.M. performed oral sex on Malone while he was driving. Malone eventually pulled the car over, and K.M. continued the oral sex until Malone finished. When asked why she never told anyone what was happening, K.M. testified that Malone told her that if she told anyone about what was going on, he would kill her.</p>\n<p>In August 1998, when K.M. was around thirteen years old, Brenda, K.M., Whitney, and Malone moved into the house of Malone's brother, Tony, or \"Uncle Tony\" as K.M. referred to him. K.M. testified that many instances of sexual abuse occurred at Tony's house. On one occasion, K.M. came home from school with a bad progress report and showed it to Malone, who responded angrily to the news and asked why the report was poor. She told Malone that she was doing the best she could, but he accused her of lying. He ordered her to \"drop her drawers,\" which K.M. testified meant that he wanted her to take everything off from the waist down. Malone then began to beat her with his belt, stopping only after he noticed that his brother had pulled his vehicle into the driveway.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> K.M. testified about another assault at Tony's house. This one occurred after K.M. came home from school and Malone confronted her with news that K.M.'s school had called to tell him that she had received detention because she was talking in class and being disruptive. Malone became angry and began beating her with a belt. Malone told her that she \"had a chance to redeem herself.\" K.M. performed oral sex on Malone, but because she was crying, she twice accidentally bit his penis. This made Malone angry, which resulted in him beating and raping her.</p>\n<p>K.M. testified regarding another sexual assault, one almost discovered by Brenda. That time, Malone thought that Brenda had left the house and ordered K.M. to perform oral sex on him, with which she complied. Brenda, however, was having car trouble and returned to the house. Brenda entered her and Malone's bedroom, and K.M. jumped up and her father quickly covered himself. Her mother asked what was going on, but both denied anything untoward.</p>\n<p>In around October 1998, K.M., Brenda, and Whitney moved in with an aunt and her family. K.M. testified about another assault, which, according to K.M.'s testimony, occurred on Christmas Day 1998. On that day, K.M. was opening presents and playing with her sister when Brenda informed K.M. that her father was coming to pick up her and Whitney. K.M. protested, telling her mother that she didn't want to go. She cried and begged her mother not to make her go with her father, but Brenda denied her pleadings. When Malone picked her up, he confronted his daughter about her apprehension about seeing him. He was angry, grabbed her, hit her in the face, and smashed her head against the car window. Once at her uncle's house, Malone told Whitney to leave him and K.M. alone. Malone again demanded oral sex, with which K.M. complied, after which he raped her.</p>\n<p>K.M. testified to other assaults, which included the playing and viewing of pornographic videos while Malone received oral sex from K.M., raped her, or both. K.M. testified that she had seen pornographic tapes with her father on seven or eight occasions, and that, all told, he had assaulted her \"many times.\"</p>\n<p>Finally, K.M. testified about the events of July 20, 1999. After the argument in which Brenda informed Malone of her desire to have him leave the home, Malone called his daughters from their bedrooms. He took them to Friendly's Restaurant to \"sa[y] good-bye.\" Once there, Malone gave Whitney some money to get something to eat in the restaurant, but Malone and K.M. stayed in the car. Malone asked K.M. if she was going to tell Brenda about the sexual abuse. K.M. told him that she was indeed going to tell Brenda. Malone responded to this by offering to give his pager to K.M. if she would remain quiet for at least twenty-four hours. He then asked whether she would remain quiet for three weeks if he gave her his cell phone. Then he offered to give her $3,000 every three months for the rest of her life if she agreed to remain silent. K.M. took the pager and cell phone and then went home. At home, she told her mother that Malone had been raping her for almost four and a half years.</p>\n<p>On cross-examination, Malone's counsel sought to establish that K.M. had animus toward Malone because he was, in the words of the defense, a \"strict disciplinarian.\" In an effort to undermine K.M.'s credibility, defense counsel also focused on inconsistencies or omissions between K.M.'s trial testimony and the statements she made to Officer Gomsey, as those statements were recorded in Gomsey's two police reports. Gomsey's reports were not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> entered into evidence, but defense counsel used the reports to refresh K.M.'s memory when, during her testimony, she expressed uncertainty about the contents of the reports or when her testimony was inconsistent with the statements that she had made to Gomsey.</p>\n<p>K.M., according to defense counsel, had told Gomsey that Tony never came home during an assault, yet she testified that Tony came home during one of the assaults. On cross-examination, K.M. denied telling Gomsey that Tony came home while Malone was committing a sexual assault, but testified that she told Gomsey that he came home during a physical assault. Defense counsel questioned K.M. about whether she had told Gomsey that the Christmas assault had in fact occurred the day after Christmas. K.M. acknowledged that she was \"not good with remembering exactly what [she] said,\" but insisted that she did not remember telling Gomsey that the sexual assault had occurred the day after Christmas. Counsel challenged K.M.'s testimony that Malone was unclothed when Brenda walked in on them; she testified on cross that she didn't remember whether she told Gomsey that Malone was unclothed. After viewing Gomsey's report to refresh her memory, K.M. then denied telling Gomsey that Malone was clothed.</p>\n<p>Defense counsel further challenged K.M. with Gomsey's report. K.M., in her direct testimony, stated that Malone had given her his pager for one day of silence and his cell phone for three weeks of silence, but Gomsey's police report stated that K.M. said that Malone offered K.M. the pager for one week of silence and the cell phone for three months of silence. During cross-examination, K.M. denied telling Gomsey anything inconsistent with her testimony in this regard.</p>\n<p>The defense challenged K.M. with other omissions or inconsistencies. K.M., on direct, testified that Malone promised her $3,000 every three months if she kept quiet forever, although there was no mention of the $3,000 payments in Gomsey's two reports. During cross-examination, K.M. testified that she did tell Gomsey about the $3,000. K.M. testified that during the very first incident of sexual abuse a pornographic tape was playing; Gomsey's reports fail to mention the pornographic tape. During cross-examination, K.M. again testified that a pornographic tape had been playing during the first incident, and she insisted that she had told Gomsey about it.</p>\n<p>After K.M. finished testifying, the Commonwealth revealed that their second witness, Brenda, would be their only fresh-complaint witness.<sup>[2]</sup> Although the Commonwealth listed several fresh complaint witnesses, including Gomsey, at a pretrial hearing, the trial judge limited the Commonwealth's fresh complaint witnesses to one.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> Brenda, as the fresh complaint witness, testified about K.M. telling her that Malone had been raping her for four and a half years. Brenda testified that K.M. had told her that Malone \"was making her have sex with him.\"</p>\n<p>In addition to serving as the fresh complaint witness, Brenda testified to two events which supported K.M.'s testimony. First, Brenda testified that she had in fact come into her bedroom and saw Malone and K.M. in bed together and that the instant she opened the door, K.M. jumped out of bed. Brenda testified that K.M. denied that anything improper was taking place. Second, Brenda testified that on another occasion she had come home from work and entered her bedroom to find Malone holding a belt and standing over K.M., who was bent over crying and completely unclothed with a pair of socks stuffed in her mouth.<sup>[4]</sup> Brenda testified that when she asked Malone why he was spanking K.M. completely naked and why K.M. had a sock in her mouth, Malone stated that the sock was necessary to keep K.M. from screaming. After Brenda testified, the first day of the trial concluded.</p>\n<p>On the second morning of the trial, defense counsel requested a continuance to serve Officer Gomsey with a subpoena to appear and testify as a defense witness. Defense counsel explained that he thought that the Commonwealth was going to call Gomsey as a fresh complaint witness in its case-in-chief and therefore failed to serve her with a subpoena. The court denied the continuance, concluding that the fresh complaint witnesses had been limited to one and it was apparent at the close of the previous day's proceedings that the Commonwealth was not going to call Gomsey.</p>\n<p>Following that, the Commonwealth called Whitney, who corroborated some of K.M.'s testimony regarding what happened at Friendly's. Whitney also testified to seeing bruises on K.M.'s thighs, and seeing the door closed on the bedroom while K.M. and Malone were inside. The Commonwealth then rested. Defense counsel renewed his request for a continuance to subpoena Gomsey, but the trial judge again denied the request.</p>\n<p>The defense called Malone's mother Kelli, who testified to conversations she had with Malone about moving to Michigan, and then the defense called Malone himself. Malone acknowledged that, in his words, he \"disciplined\" K.M. with \"whoopings,\" which included beatings with a belt, but denied having any sexual relations with his daughter. Malone also testified to K.M.'s animosity toward him, which he believed flowed from his \"disciplin[ing]\" ways. On cross-examination, Malone admitted to beating his naked daughter while she had socks stuffed in her mouth, as well as to other physical assaults. With that, the defense rested.</p>\n<p>Defense counsel then made an offer of proof, describing the eight alleged inconsistencies that would have been brought to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> light had he been allowed to subpoena Gomsey: (1) K.M. testified that Tony came home during a sexual and physical assault that occurred while she was living at her Uncle Tony's house, whereas Gomsey's report states that Uncle Tony came home during an incident in which Malone was \"beating\" K.M.; (2) K.M. testified that she had been raped and assaulted by Malone on Christmas Day 1998, whereas the report stated that K.M. had only been physically assaulted on that occasion; (3) regarding the incident where Brenda nearly caught Malone and K.M. in a sexual act, K.M. testified that Malone was unclothed when her mother walked in on K.M. and Malone, whereas the report stated that Malone was clothed during this incident; (4) K.M. testified that Malone had given her his pager for one day of silence and his cell phone for three weeks of silence, whereas the report stated that Malone offered K.M. the pager for one week of silence and the cell phone for three months of silence; (5) K.M. testified that Malone promised her $3,000 every three months if she kept quiet forever, whereas the reports do not mention the $3,000; (6) K.M. testified that during the very first incident of sexual abuse a pornographic tape was playing, whereas the reports fail to mention the pornographic tape; (7) K.M. testified that Malone threatened her after the first incident of sexual abuse, whereas the reports fail to mention any threats made by Malone after the first sexual assault; and (8) K.M. testified that Malone made her \"earn\" a limousine ride for her twelfth birthday by performing oral sex and having sexual intercourse, whereas the reports fail to mention the limousine incident.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>After presenting his offer of proof, defense counsel admitted to the court that his failure to subpoena Gomsey was not a strategic decision but a \"mistake.\" The trial court responded to counsel's remark:</p>\n<blockquote>I don't think you necessarily made a mistake; I think you obtained from the complaining witness the inconsistencies that were described to the officer, without permitting the officer to testify as to everything else that was told, because as I understand the doctrine, simply because someone makes an inconsistent statement, unless there's an accusation of recent contrivance, it doesn't make all other consistent statements admissible. So you got the best of both worlds. So I don't see where you made any mistake.</blockquote>\n<p>Malone was found guilty of three counts of rape and abuse of a child under sixteen and one count of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen. Malone appealed and, while his direct appeal was pending, he filed a motion for a new trial in the Superior Court. In the motion, Malone argued, among other things, that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to serve Gomsey with a subpoena to compel her presence at trial. Malone's motion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> for a new trial was denied by the Superior Court.</p>\n<p>In his consolidated appeal to the Massachusetts Appeals Court, Malone raised the same ineffectiveness claim that had been rejected in his motion for a new trial. The Appeals Court affirmed Malone's conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial. <i>Commonwealth v. Malone,</i> 780 N.E.2d 489, 2002 WL 31890964, at **1-2 (Mass.App.Ct.2002) (unpublished table decision). That court held that Malone was not denied effective assistance of counsel, reasoning that the absence of Gomsey's testimony was \"not significantly prejudicial\" because she would have only provided \"cumulative impeachment testimony.\" <i>Malone,</i> 2002 WL 31890964, at *1. Malone then filed an Application for Leave to Obtain Further Appellate Review with the SJC, which was summarily denied. <i>See </i><i>Commonwealth v. Malone,</i> 446 Mass. 1104, 843 N.E.2d 638 (2006) (unpublished table decision).</p>\n<p>Following the SJC's denial of further appellate review, Malone filed a federal habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254. The district court denied the petition, but granted a certificate of appealability on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's denial of habeas corpus relief <i>de novo. </i><i>Teti v.

Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p>The applicable precedent in this case is the well-known two-prong standard articulated in <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 687, 104 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> S.Ct. 2052. Although the state court<sup>[6]</sup> failed specifically to mention the <i>Strickland</i> standard, applying instead Massachusetts's standard articulated in <i>Commonwealth v. Saferian,</i> 366 Mass. 89, 315 N.E.2d 878, 883 (1974), we have held that \"for habeas purposes, <i>Saferian</i> is a functional equivalent of <i>Strickland,</i>\" <i>Ouber v. Guarino,</i> 293 F.3d 19, 32 (1st Cir.2002).<sup>[7]</sup> Thus, the state court did not apply a legal rule that contradicts an established Supreme Court precedent. <i>See </i><i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this case does not fall under the \"contrary to\" category of the AEDPA. Although the Supreme Court has addressed a wide-variety of ineffective assistance of counsel cases, petitioner has pointed us to no Supreme Court case reaching a different result than the state court in the this case involving materially indistinguishable facts, nor have we found such a case.</p>\n<p>\"AEDPA[, however,] `does not require state and federal courts to wait for some nearly identical factual pattern before a legal rule must be applied.'\" <i>Panetti v. Quarterman,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2842, 2858, 168 L.Ed.2d 662 (2007) (quoting <i>Carey v. Musladin,</i> 549 U.S. 70, 127 S.Ct. 649, 657, 166 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006) (Kennedy, J., concurring)). Malone also would be entitled to relief if he shows that the state court unreasonably applied clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court. <i>See </i><i>Rompilla,</i> 545 U.S. at 380, 125 S.Ct. 2456. An \"unreasonable application\" of federal law occurs when the state court identifies the correct legal principle, \"but (i) applies those principles to the facts of the case in an objectively unreasonable manner; (ii) unreasonably extends clearly established legal principles to a new context where they should not apply; or (iii) unreasonably refuses to extend established principles to a new context where they should apply.\" <i>Sleeper,</i> 510 F.3d at 38 (citing <i>L'Abbe v. DiPaolo,</i> 311 F.3d 93, 96 (1st Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p>Neither (ii) nor (iii) applies in this case Malone is not arguing that the state unreasonably extended <i>Strickland</i> to a new context or that the state court unreasonably refused to extend <i>Strickland</i> to a new context. Thus, the question before us is whether the state court applied the principles of <i>Strickland</i> to the facts in Malone's case in an objectively unreasonable manner, to which we turn next.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</i>\n</h2>\n<p>To be entitled to relief for constitutionally ineffective assistance, under <i>Strickland,</i> Malone must show (1) deficient performance by counsel (2) resulting in prejudice. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> <i>Rompilla,</i> 545 U.S. at 380, 125 S.Ct. 2456 (citing <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</p>\n<p>While Malone must prove both prongs to prevail, we have held that \"a reviewing court need not address both requirements if the evidence as to either is lacking.\" <i>Sleeper,</i> 510 F.3d at 39. That is, \"[i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be followed.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Strickland,</i> 466 at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052). That is the course we follow here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Malone Suffered No Prejudice</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The prejudice prong requires Malone to demonstrate \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. <i>Id.</i> \"The assessment of prejudice should proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision.\" <i>Id.</i> at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \"[A] court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Malone argues that the state court's application of <i>Strickland</i> was unreasonable because he was prejudiced by defense counsel's failure to subpoena Gomsey. To Malone, Gomsey was the \"sole witness capable of discrediting the alleged victim's testimony.\" Malone argues, correctly, that in a case such as this, where the Commonwealth's presentation of physical evidence was limited, the credibility of the victim is particularly important. Given that, Malone argues that trial counsel's failure to insure Gomsey's presence at trial \"crippled\" the defense's ability to impeach K.M.'s credibility. Malone argues, \"[t]he outcome of the trial might have well been different had the defense lawyer presented the prior inconsistent statements of the alleged victim through Officer Gomsey.\" Appellant's Br. at 19-20.</p>\n<p>Malone, however, must show more. His burden is not to demonstrate that the outcome \"might\" have been different, but to demonstrate \"a probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Not only must Malone demonstrate that counsel's failure undermines our confidence in the outcome, <i>see </i><i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, but he must also demonstrate that the state court applied <i>Strickland</i>'s prejudice principles to the facts of the case in an objectively unreasonable manner, <i>Sleeper,</i> 510 F.3d at 38.</p>\n<p>We have recognized that \"where the relevant error is failure to impeach a government witness, we begin by assessing the strength of the prosecution's case, and the effectiveness of the defense absent the impeachment evidence.\" <i>Stephens v. Hall,</i> 294 F.3d 210, 218 (1st Cir.2002). We then consider \"`the potential impeachment value' of the evidence `in undermining the credibility of the witness's testimony.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Gonzalez-Soberal v. United States,</i> 244 F.3d 273, 278 (1st Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The Strength of the Prosecution's Case</i>\n</h2>\n<p>K.M.'s credibility was central to the prosecution's case. The Commonwealth presented no physical evidence. The parties did, however, stipulate that Brenda had delivered three videotapes containing pornographic scenes to the Yarmouth Police and that those tapes came from the home in which Malone resided. Brenda and Whitney did not testify to seeing sexual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> abuse, only physical abuse. Brenda testified to (1) seeing bruises on K.M.'s thighs and buttocks, (2) Malone hitting K.M. and Whitney clothed and unclothed with a belt, (3) walking in on Malone and K.M. lying on a bed and K.M. suddenly \"jumping,\" and, (4) walking in on Malone beating a naked K.M. with a belt while she had a sock stuffed in her mouth. Whitney testified to (1) seeing bruises on K.M.'s thighs and (2) seeing the door closed on Malone's bedroom while K.M. and Malone were inside. Malone admitted to hitting his daughters, clothed and unclothed, with his hand and belt, and he admitted that he beat a naked K.M. with a belt while a sock was stuffed in her mouth. Malone, however, denied all allegations of sexual abuse. In essence then, the case turned on whether the jury believed K.M.'s testimony of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>Even based on our review of the cold record, it is clear to us that K.M.'s testimony provided a vivid and descriptive account of years of sexual abuse by her father. The jury was able to observe K.M. as she recited the times in which her father allowed her to \"redeem herself\" by performing oral sex on him or by allowing him to have intercourse with her. The jury saw her face as she described the \"favors\" her father asked her to do. The jury heard K.M. testify that her father had cuffed her in the head, saying \"Don't bite my shit,\" when she accidentally bit his penis. The jury heard her describe the beatings and the accounts of oral sex performed upon her father while pornographic movies were playing in the background. And the jury decided that with regard to the central question before itwhether Malone had raped and sexually assaulted his daughterK.M., and not Malone, was believable.</p>\n<p>The jury decided that K.M. was credible even though it was abundantly clear that K.M. had provided varying accounts as to some of the details of the assaults. Defense counsel highlighted many of these inconsistencies through cross-examination of K.M., Brenda, and Whitney. Indeed, of the eight \"inconsistencies\" that defense counsel listed in his offer of proof, defense counsel highlighted all but one of the inconsistencies on cross-examination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The Effectiveness of the Defense and the Potential Impeachment Value of Gomsey's Testimony</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Malone contends that Gomsey's testimony would have impeached K.M. because Gomsey would have testified that K.M.'s testimony was inconsistent with what K.M. told Gomsey. Defense counsel did, however, effectively attack K.M. with all but one of the alleged inconsistencies that Malone contends would have come out had Gomsey testified. Defense counsel confronted K.M. with the reports' statements that: (1) Tony never came home during a sexual assault, even though K.M. testified that Tony came home during a physical assault; (2) K.M. was physically assaulted, and not sexually assaulted, on Christmas Day 1998, and during cross-examination K.M. admitted that she had only reported the physical abuse to Gomsey; (3) Malone was clothed during the incident in which Brenda came home and nearly caught K.M. and Malone in a sexual act, and when confronted with this on cross-examination, K.M. denied telling Gomsey that Malone was clothed; and (4) Malone had offered the pager for one week of silence and the cell phone for three months of silence, and not one day and three weeks, respectively, as K.M. testified, and on cross-examination, K.M. denied telling Gomsey about her father's offer. Defense counsel also confronted K.M. regarding events to which she testified that were omitted from Gomsey's reports. The reports fail to mention that (5) Malone offered to pay $3,000 every three months in exchange for K.M.'s permanent silence, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> but K.M. insisted on cross-examination that she did tell Gomsey about the $3,000; (6) a pornographic tape was playing during the first sexual assault, but K.M., on cross-examination, insisted that such a tape was playing during the assault and that she had told Gomsey about it; and (7) Malone threatened to kill K.M. after the first incident of sexual abuse, whereas K.M. testified on cross-examination that she \"made sure\" that Gomsey knew about the threat after the first incident. Of all the \"inconsistencies\" listed by the defense counsel in his offer of proof, only (8) was not touched upon at all during K.M.'s cross examination: the report's failure to mention that Malone made K.M. \"earn\" her limousine ride by performing oral sex and having sexual intercourse with him; counsel failed to question K.M. about that omission on cross-examination.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Additional inconsistencies in K.M.'s trial testimony also were highlighted through the testimony and cross-examination of Brenda and Whitney. Brenda testified that K.M. had told her that Malone had told K.M. to wait at least three months before telling Brenda about the abuse, whereas K.M. testified that her father had given her his pager for one day of silence and his cell phone for three weeks of silence. (Gomsey's report comports with Brenda's testimony, stating that Malone had promised K.M. his cell phone for \"three months of silence.\") Brenda also contradicted her daughter's testimony regarding details in connection with the sexual assault that occurred after K.M. stayed out too late and Malone \"offered\" her the chance to \"redeem herself\": K.M. testified that her father picked her up when she was out late one night, whereas Brenda testified that K.M.'s friend's mother picked up K.M.</p>\n<p>K.M.'s younger sister's testimony was also inconsistent with K.M.'s testimony in some respects. Whitney testified that she remembered seeing her father the day after Christmas 1998, whereas K.M. testified that her father raped her on Christmas Day 1998. Even after reviewing Gomsey's report to refresh her recollection, K.M. stated that she did not remember telling Gomsey it was the day after Christmas. (Gomsey's report states that an incident with K.M. and Malone occurred \"[t]he day after Christmas 1998 or near that time.\")</p>\n<p>Defense counsel even extracted an admission from K.M. that the details of her stories were not always consistent. When asked about what she said during her interviews with Gomsey, K.M. admitted that she \"was not too good with memory,\" or at \"remembering exactly what she said.\"</p>\n<p>The defense was sufficiently effective in challenging K.M.'s credibility based upon her inconsistencies that the prosecution felt compelled to address directly K.M.'s credibility in its closing argument. The prosecutor acknowledged that K.M.'s testimony concerning various details was not always consistent, and argued that</p>\n<blockquote>for us to sit here in judgment and to say, [\"]You don't know the exact dates and times, you don't know how you've gotten to the car or who picked you up from a certain time and place[\"] is not reasonable. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> It's not even logical. It doesn't even make common sense, to think that she would be able to decipher between each and every time that this man raped her[.]</blockquote>\n<p>The jury knew full well that K.M. had told inconsistent stories regarding various details of the rapes. K.M., the defense, and the prosecution all acknowledged as much to the jury.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>The Totality of the Evidence</i>\n</h2>\n<p>After reviewing the totality of the evidence before the jury, we conclude that the potential impeachment value of Gomsey's testimony would not have significantly undermined K.M.'s credibility. Although we have noted that \"a significant factor weighing in favor of finding prejudice is the absence of any corroborating evidence other than the testimony of the witness whom defense counsel failed to impeach,\" <i>Stephens,</i> 294 F.3d at 225 (citing <i>Gonzalez-Soberal,</i> 244 F.3d at 278), here, defense counsel did not fail to impeach K.M. And the jury was repeatedly presented with K.M.'s inconsistent statements, inconsistencies that the prosecution acknowledged. The jury nevertheless found K.M. credible regarding the allegations of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>Moreover, calling Gomsey to testify would have come with a price. Gomsey's report states that she knew K.M. through working at K.M.'s middle school and that she \"kn[e]w [K.M.] to be a good person and to my knowledge had always been truthful with me.\" As the state court noted, given that \"Officer Gomsey's potential testimony would have been cumulative of testimony already in evidence,\" Malone may well have benefitted from her absence. <i>See Malone,</i> 2002 WL 31890964, at *1. That is, as the trial judge told Malone's counsel, and the state appellate court quoted approvingly, Malone \"obtained from the complaining witness the inconsistencies that were described to the officer, without permitting the officer to testify as to everything else that was told[.]\" <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>Therefore, we conclude that the state court's decision that Malone was not prejudiced by his counsel's failure to call Gomsey was not an unreasonable application of <i>Strickland.</i> While unreasonableness may, at times, be \"difficult to define,\" <i>McCambridge v. Hall,</i> 303 F.3d 24, 36 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc), we have no difficulty in concluding in this case that the state court did not commit AEDPA error. We cannot say that the state court's decision was unreasonable in the independent and objective judgment of this court. In fact, we agree with the state court. Gomsey's failure to testify does not undermine our confidence in the outcome of Malone's trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Because the state court did not unreasonably apply the <i>Strickland</i> standard to the facts of Malone's case, its determination that Malone was not prejudiced by his counsel's failure to subpoena Gomsey was not error under the AEDPA.</p>\n<p>The district court's denial of Malone's habeas petition is</p>\n<p>AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2), Harold W. Clarke has been substituted for his predecessor Kathleen M. Dennehy, as Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p>[**]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Because this case turns on whether Malone was prejudiced by his counsel's failure to call Officer Gomsey and counsel's alleged subsequent failure to impeach K.M., it is necessary to describe K.M.'s testimony in some detail in order properly to assess the prejudice issue.</p>\n<p>[2]  Under Massachusetts law at the time of Malone's trial, the \"fresh complaint\" doctrine provided \"an exception to the usual rule that a prior statement of a witness that is merely repetitive of the witness's trial testimony is not admissible except in limited circumstances, such as on redirect examination to rehabilitate the witness after impeachment on a claim of recent contrivance.\" <i>See </i><i>Commonwealth v. King,</i> 445 Mass. 217, 834 N.E.2d 1175, 1187-90 (2005) (discussing the history and application of the fresh complaint doctrine). The doctrine allows the prosecution to rebut any inference that the alleged victim of a sexual assault is fabricating evidence by allowing evidence from a \"fresh complaint\" witness that the victim did, in fact, complain while the assault was still \"fresh.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  At the time of Malone's trial it was generally a trial judge's practice to limit the number of fresh complaint witnesses, but the judge had the discretion to allow more than one fresh complaint witness. However, in <i>King,</i> 834 N.E.2d at 1197-98, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") adopted a fresh complaint rule that now, as a general matter, limits such testimony to one witness  the first person told of the assault, <i>see id.</i> at 1198 (allowing a judge, in limited circumstances, to permit the testimony of a fresh complaint witness who was not the first person told of the assault where, for example, the \"first person told of the alleged assault is unavailable, incompetent, or too young to testify meaningfully\"). The changes in the Massachusetts fresh complaint doctrine apply prospectively to only those sexual assault cases tried after the issuance of the opinion. <i>See id.</i> at 1201. Malone's trial occurred prior to <i>King</i>'s one fresh complaint witness rule.</p>\n<p>[4]  Brenda also testified about other physical abuse, stating that she had seen bruises on K.M.'s thighs and buttocks, and had witnessed Malone hitting K.M. with a belt.</p>\n<p>[5]  On appeal, Malone provides two additional inconsistencies, which were not included in defense counsel's offer of proof, that could have been explored had Gomsey testified:\n</p>\n<p>(1) During cross-examination, K.M. denied ever reporting to Gomsey that Malone had ripped off her clothes during an incident at Uncle Tony's house, whereas the report stated that during the incident that occurred when Uncle Tony came home, Malone choked K.M. and began to rip off her clothes.</p>\n<p>(2) Gomsey's report stated that K.M.'s school had called the house because she had detention and because her progress report was bad. According to the report, Malone offered K.M. a chance to \"redeem herself\" by performing oral sex. During cross-examination, K.M. denied telling Gomsey that the progress report and detention occurred at the same time.</p>\n<p>[6]  The highest state court, the SJC, summarily denied Malone's habeas claim, <i>see </i><i>Malone,</i> 446 Mass. 1104, 843 N.E.2d 638, therefore, we \"look through\" to \"the last reasoned decision,\" which is the decision of the Massachusetts Appeals Court. <i>Gunter v. Maloney,</i> 291 F.3d 74, 80 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <i>Ylst v. Nunnemaker,</i> 501 U.S. 797, 804, 111 S.Ct. 2590, 115 L.Ed.2d 706 (1991)).</p>\n<p>[7]  Under <i>Saferian,</i> the petitioner \"must demonstrate that there `has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,'\" and if that is found, the petitioner \"must show that such behavior `has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.'\" <i>Commonwealth v. Sargent,</i> 449 Mass. 576, 870 N.E.2d 602, 610 (2007) (quoting <i>Saferian,</i> 315 N.E.2d at 883). We have concluded that <i>Saferian</i>'s \"depriving the defendant of an otherwise available substantial ground of defense\" prong subsumes <i>Strickland</i>'s prejudice prong. <i>See </i><i>Ouber,</i> 293 F.3d at 32 (\"[T]he SJC has concluded that <i>Saferian</i> is at least as solicitous of Sixth Amendment rights as <i>Strickland.</i>\"); <i>accord </i><i>Stephens v. Hall,</i> 294 F.3d 210, 214-15 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>[8]  Even the two additional inconsistencies that Malone raises for the first time on appeal were addressed at trial. Malone's counsel asked K.M. whether she had told Gomsey that her father began to rip off her clothes during the assault in which Tony came home, and K.M. denied telling that to Gomsey. Defense counsel also questioned K.M. about whether K.M. had told Gomsey that Malone's offer to \"redeem herself\" was in connection with the school calling home because K.M. had received detention and an unfavorable progress report, and K.M. denied telling Gomsey that the progress report and detention occurred at the same time.</p>\n\n</div>",

After exhausting his state court remedies, Malone petitioned for federal habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254. Malone alleged that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failure to subpoena a police officer who could have impeached the testimony of his daughter, who we refer to as \"K.M.,\" the principal witness against him. The district court denied the petition. Because we conclude that the Massachusetts Appeals Court's decision that Malone suffered no prejudice from his counsel's failure to subpoena the witness was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, we affirm the district court's denial of Malone's habeas petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Brenda and Gerald Malone were married and have two children together, \"K.M.\" and Whitney. On July 20, 1999, as they often did, Gerald and Brenda argued. Following the argument on this occasion, however, Brenda informed Gerald Malone (\"Malone\") that she no longer wanted to be his wife, that she had consulted with a divorce attorney, and that she wanted him to move out of their house. After Malone packed his belongings and left the house, K.M. told her mother that her father had been raping her for nearly four and a half years.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing this, Brenda took K.M. to the South Yarmouth Police Department. There, K.M. was interviewed by Officer Cheryl Nugent Gomsey. Gomsey prepared an initial report which contained K.M.'s statements regarding her father's sexual assaults. On October 26, 1999, Gomsey conducted a follow-up interview and prepared an additional report. In August 1999, Malone was indicted on charges of raping and assaulting K.M.</p>\n<p>At trial, the Commonwealth's case consisted of the testimony of K.M., her younger sister Whitney, and Brenda. K.M. was the main witness and she provided a vivid account of years of repeated rapes and sexual assaults by her father.<sup>[1]</sup> K.M. began with the first incident (which occurred in 1995), telling the jury that when she was 11 years old, her father called her into her mother's bedroom-Malone and Brenda lived apart at that time, but Malone regularly visited  and asked K.M. if she could \"do him a favor.\" K.M. testified that Malone was lying on the bed and a pornographic movie was playing on the television. He pulled the covers off of himself, exposing his naked body to his daughter. Malone, referring to his penis, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> told K.M. that he needed her to \"suck this\" for him. K.M. did as she was told, but while performing fellatio, she accidentally bit Malone's penis. Malone hit her on the head, telling her \"Don't bite my shit again.\" K.M. continued performing oral sex until Malone ejaculated.</p>\n<p>K.M. testified about other assaults. The second occurred about a week or two after the first. K.M. testified that she came home from school, and Malone was sitting in the living room. Upon hearing his daughter come home, he called for her. Malone asked her, \"Remember that favor I asked you to do a long time ago?\" K.M. remembered, but said, \"I thought I didn't have to do this anymore, Daddy.\" To this Malone responded, \"I changed my mind.\" Being afraid, K.M. said okay. Malone unzipped his pants, removed his penis, and ordered K.M. to perform oral sex on him, which she did.</p>\n<p>K.M. testified to another assault which occurred shortly before her twelfth birthday. This time, Malone called K.M. into her mother's bedroom. Malone reminded her of their family \"tradition\" of renting a limousine for the children's twelfth birthdays-Malone had rented a limousine for K.M.'s older sister (who we gather is not Malone's child) when she turned 12 and, at that time, he told the other two children that they would get the same thing on their twelfth birthdays. In the bedroom, however, Malone told K.M. that if she wanted her limousine she would \"have to earn it.\" K.M. testified that she understood what her father had in mind. He offered to let her \"do it\" after her birthday, but K.M. said no, preferring to \"do it\" then. Malone ordered her to take off all her clothes and perform oral sex on him. Malone then performed oral sex on her and had intercourse with her.</p>\n<p>In June 1997, Brenda and Malone married, and, a few months before the wedding, Malone moved in with Brenda, K.M., and Whitney. K.M. testified to another sexual assault which occurred during this period. This assault occurred after K.M. had gotten into trouble for being out too late. According to K.M., Malone picked her up and drove her back home. Once they returned home, Brenda \"started hollering and screaming at\" her. Malone and Brenda quarreled for a time, with Malone telling Brenda to leave K.M. alone. Malone and K.M. eventually left in his car. In the car, Malone told her that she could \"redeem\" herself, saying that she had the chance to get out of trouble. They drove off, and, while Malone was driving, he unzipped his pants and said, \"Here.\" K.M. performed oral sex on Malone while he was driving. Malone eventually pulled the car over, and K.M. continued the oral sex until Malone finished. When asked why she never told anyone what was happening, K.M. testified that Malone told her that if she told anyone about what was going on, he would kill her.</p>\n<p>In August 1998, when K.M. was around thirteen years old, Brenda, K.M., Whitney, and Malone moved into the house of Malone's brother, Tony, or \"Uncle Tony\" as K.M. referred to him. K.M. testified that many instances of sexual abuse occurred at Tony's house. On one occasion, K.M. came home from school with a bad progress report and showed it to Malone, who responded angrily to the news and asked why the report was poor. She told Malone that she was doing the best she could, but he accused her of lying. He ordered her to \"drop her drawers,\" which K.M. testified meant that he wanted her to take everything off from the waist down. Malone then began to beat her with his belt, stopping only after he noticed that his brother had pulled his vehicle into the driveway.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> K.M. testified about another assault at Tony's house. This one occurred after K.M. came home from school and Malone confronted her with news that K.M.'s school had called to tell him that she had received detention because she was talking in class and being disruptive. Malone became angry and began beating her with a belt. Malone told her that she \"had a chance to redeem herself.\" K.M. performed oral sex on Malone, but because she was crying, she twice accidentally bit his penis. This made Malone angry, which resulted in him beating and raping her.</p>\n<p>K.M. testified regarding another sexual assault, one almost discovered by Brenda. That time, Malone thought that Brenda had left the house and ordered K.M. to perform oral sex on him, with which she complied. Brenda, however, was having car trouble and returned to the house. Brenda entered her and Malone's bedroom, and K.M. jumped up and her father quickly covered himself. Her mother asked what was going on, but both denied anything untoward.</p>\n<p>In around October 1998, K.M., Brenda, and Whitney moved in with an aunt and her family. K.M. testified about another assault, which, according to K.M.'s testimony, occurred on Christmas Day 1998. On that day, K.M. was opening presents and playing with her sister when Brenda informed K.M. that her father was coming to pick up her and Whitney. K.M. protested, telling her mother that she didn't want to go. She cried and begged her mother not to make her go with her father, but Brenda denied her pleadings. When Malone picked her up, he confronted his daughter about her apprehension about seeing him. He was angry, grabbed her, hit her in the face, and smashed her head against the car window. Once at her uncle's house, Malone told Whitney to leave him and K.M. alone. Malone again demanded oral sex, with which K.M. complied, after which he raped her.</p>\n<p>K.M. testified to other assaults, which included the playing and viewing of pornographic videos while Malone received oral sex from K.M., raped her, or both. K.M. testified that she had seen pornographic tapes with her father on seven or eight occasions, and that, all told, he had assaulted her \"many times.\"</p>\n<p>Finally, K.M. testified about the events of July 20, 1999. After the argument in which Brenda informed Malone of her desire to have him leave the home, Malone called his daughters from their bedrooms. He took them to Friendly's Restaurant to \"sa[y] good-bye.\" Once there, Malone gave Whitney some money to get something to eat in the restaurant, but Malone and K.M. stayed in the car. Malone asked K.M. if she was going to tell Brenda about the sexual abuse. K.M. told him that she was indeed going to tell Brenda. Malone responded to this by offering to give his pager to K.M. if she would remain quiet for at least twenty-four hours. He then asked whether she would remain quiet for three weeks if he gave her his cell phone. Then he offered to give her $3,000 every three months for the rest of her life if she agreed to remain silent. K.M. took the pager and cell phone and then went home. At home, she told her mother that Malone had been raping her for almost four and a half years.</p>\n<p>On cross-examination, Malone's counsel sought to establish that K.M. had animus toward Malone because he was, in the words of the defense, a \"strict disciplinarian.\" In an effort to undermine K.M.'s credibility, defense counsel also focused on inconsistencies or omissions between K.M.'s trial testimony and the statements she made to Officer Gomsey, as those statements were recorded in Gomsey's two police reports. Gomsey's reports were not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> entered into evidence, but defense counsel used the reports to refresh K.M.'s memory when, during her testimony, she expressed uncertainty about the contents of the reports or when her testimony was inconsistent with the statements that she had made to Gomsey.</p>\n<p>K.M., according to defense counsel, had told Gomsey that Tony never came home during an assault, yet she testified that Tony came home during one of the assaults. On cross-examination, K.M. denied telling Gomsey that Tony came home while Malone was committing a sexual assault, but testified that she told Gomsey that he came home during a physical assault. Defense counsel questioned K.M. about whether she had told Gomsey that the Christmas assault had in fact occurred the day after Christmas. K.M. acknowledged that she was \"not good with remembering exactly what [she] said,\" but insisted that she did not remember telling Gomsey that the sexual assault had occurred the day after Christmas. Counsel challenged K.M.'s testimony that Malone was unclothed when Brenda walked in on them; she testified on cross that she didn't remember whether she told Gomsey that Malone was unclothed. After viewing Gomsey's report to refresh her memory, K.M. then denied telling Gomsey that Malone was clothed.</p>\n<p>Defense counsel further challenged K.M. with Gomsey's report. K.M., in her direct testimony, stated that Malone had given her his pager for one day of silence and his cell phone for three weeks of silence, but Gomsey's police report stated that K.M. said that Malone offered K.M. the pager for one week of silence and the cell phone for three months of silence. During cross-examination, K.M. denied telling Gomsey anything inconsistent with her testimony in this regard.</p>\n<p>The defense challenged K.M. with other omissions or inconsistencies. K.M., on direct, testified that Malone promised her $3,000 every three months if she kept quiet forever, although there was no mention of the $3,000 payments in Gomsey's two reports. During cross-examination, K.M. testified that she did tell Gomsey about the $3,000. K.M. testified that during the very first incident of sexual abuse a pornographic tape was playing; Gomsey's reports fail to mention the pornographic tape. During cross-examination, K.M. again testified that a pornographic tape had been playing during the first incident, and she insisted that she had told Gomsey about it.</p>\n<p>After K.M. finished testifying, the Commonwealth revealed that their second witness, Brenda, would be their only fresh-complaint witness.<sup>[2]</sup> Although the Commonwealth listed several fresh complaint witnesses, including Gomsey, at a pretrial hearing, the trial judge limited the Commonwealth's fresh complaint witnesses to one.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> Brenda, as the fresh complaint witness, testified about K.M. telling her that Malone had been raping her for four and a half years. Brenda testified that K.M. had told her that Malone \"was making her have sex with him.\"</p>\n<p>In addition to serving as the fresh complaint witness, Brenda testified to two events which supported K.M.'s testimony. First, Brenda testified that she had in fact come into her bedroom and saw Malone and K.M. in bed together and that the instant she opened the door, K.M. jumped out of bed. Brenda testified that K.M. denied that anything improper was taking place. Second, Brenda testified that on another occasion she had come home from work and entered her bedroom to find Malone holding a belt and standing over K.M., who was bent over crying and completely unclothed with a pair of socks stuffed in her mouth.<sup>[4]</sup> Brenda testified that when she asked Malone why he was spanking K.M. completely naked and why K.M. had a sock in her mouth, Malone stated that the sock was necessary to keep K.M. from screaming. After Brenda testified, the first day of the trial concluded.</p>\n<p>On the second morning of the trial, defense counsel requested a continuance to serve Officer Gomsey with a subpoena to appear and testify as a defense witness. Defense counsel explained that he thought that the Commonwealth was going to call Gomsey as a fresh complaint witness in its case-in-chief and therefore failed to serve her with a subpoena. The court denied the continuance, concluding that the fresh complaint witnesses had been limited to one and it was apparent at the close of the previous day's proceedings that the Commonwealth was not going to call Gomsey.</p>\n<p>Following that, the Commonwealth called Whitney, who corroborated some of K.M.'s testimony regarding what happened at Friendly's. Whitney also testified to seeing bruises on K.M.'s thighs, and seeing the door closed on the bedroom while K.M. and Malone were inside. The Commonwealth then rested. Defense counsel renewed his request for a continuance to subpoena Gomsey, but the trial judge again denied the request.</p>\n<p>The defense called Malone's mother Kelli, who testified to conversations she had with Malone about moving to Michigan, and then the defense called Malone himself. Malone acknowledged that, in his words, he \"disciplined\" K.M. with \"whoopings,\" which included beatings with a belt, but denied having any sexual relations with his daughter. Malone also testified to K.M.'s animosity toward him, which he believed flowed from his \"disciplin[ing]\" ways. On cross-examination, Malone admitted to beating his naked daughter while she had socks stuffed in her mouth, as well as to other physical assaults. With that, the defense rested.</p>\n<p>Defense counsel then made an offer of proof, describing the eight alleged inconsistencies that would have been brought to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> light had he been allowed to subpoena Gomsey: (1) K.M. testified that Tony came home during a sexual and physical assault that occurred while she was living at her Uncle Tony's house, whereas Gomsey's report states that Uncle Tony came home during an incident in which Malone was \"beating\" K.M.; (2) K.M. testified that she had been raped and assaulted by Malone on Christmas Day 1998, whereas the report stated that K.M. had only been physically assaulted on that occasion; (3) regarding the incident where Brenda nearly caught Malone and K.M. in a sexual act, K.M. testified that Malone was unclothed when her mother walked in on K.M. and Malone, whereas the report stated that Malone was clothed during this incident; (4) K.M. testified that Malone had given her his pager for one day of silence and his cell phone for three weeks of silence, whereas the report stated that Malone offered K.M. the pager for one week of silence and the cell phone for three months of silence; (5) K.M. testified that Malone promised her $3,000 every three months if she kept quiet forever, whereas the reports do not mention the $3,000; (6) K.M. testified that during the very first incident of sexual abuse a pornographic tape was playing, whereas the reports fail to mention the pornographic tape; (7) K.M. testified that Malone threatened her after the first incident of sexual abuse, whereas the reports fail to mention any threats made by Malone after the first sexual assault; and (8) K.M. testified that Malone made her \"earn\" a limousine ride for her twelfth birthday by performing oral sex and having sexual intercourse, whereas the reports fail to mention the limousine incident.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>After presenting his offer of proof, defense counsel admitted to the court that his failure to subpoena Gomsey was not a strategic decision but a \"mistake.\" The trial court responded to counsel's remark:</p>\n<blockquote>I don't think you necessarily made a mistake; I think you obtained from the complaining witness the inconsistencies that were described to the officer, without permitting the officer to testify as to everything else that was told, because as I understand the doctrine, simply because someone makes an inconsistent statement, unless there's an accusation of recent contrivance, it doesn't make all other consistent statements admissible. So you got the best of both worlds. So I don't see where you made any mistake.</blockquote>\n<p>Malone was found guilty of three counts of rape and abuse of a child under sixteen and one count of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen. Malone appealed and, while his direct appeal was pending, he filed a motion for a new trial in the Superior Court. In the motion, Malone argued, among other things, that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to serve Gomsey with a subpoena to compel her presence at trial. Malone's motion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> for a new trial was denied by the Superior Court.</p>\n<p>In his consolidated appeal to the Massachusetts Appeals Court, Malone raised the same ineffectiveness claim that had been rejected in his motion for a new trial. The Appeals Court affirmed Malone's conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial. <i>Commonwealth v.

An \"unreasonable application\" of federal law occurs when the state court identifies the correct legal principle, \"but (i) applies those principles to the facts of the case in an objectively unreasonable manner; (ii) unreasonably extends clearly established legal principles to a new context where they should not apply; or (iii) unreasonably refuses to extend established principles to a new context where they should apply.\" <i>Sleeper,</i> 510 F.3d at 38 (citing <i>L'Abbe v.

To Malone, Gomsey was the \"sole witness capable of discrediting the alleged victim's testimony.\" Malone argues, correctly, that in a case such as this, where the Commonwealth's presentation of physical evidence was limited, the credibility of the victim is particularly important. Given that, Malone argues that trial counsel's failure to insure Gomsey's presence at trial \"crippled\" the defense's ability to impeach K.M.'s credibility.

We then consider \"`the potential impeachment value' of the evidence `in undermining the credibility of the witness's testimony.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Gonzalez-Soberal v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772565\"><a href=\"/opinion/772565/manuel-gonz-lez-soberal-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>, 278 (1st Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The Strength of the Prosecution's Case</i>\n</h2>\n<p>K.M.'s credibility was central to the prosecution's case. The Commonwealth presented no physical evidence. The parties did, however, stipulate that Brenda had delivered three videotapes containing pornographic scenes to the Yarmouth Police and that those tapes came from the home in which Malone resided. Brenda and Whitney did not testify to seeing sexual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> abuse, only physical abuse. Brenda testified to (1) seeing bruises on K.M.'s thighs and buttocks, (2) Malone hitting K.M. and Whitney clothed and unclothed with a belt, (3) walking in on Malone and K.M. lying on a bed and K.M. suddenly \"jumping,\" and, (4) walking in on Malone beating a naked K.M. with a belt while she had a sock stuffed in her mouth. Whitney testified to (1) seeing bruises on K.M.'s thighs and (2) seeing the door closed on Malone's bedroom while K.M. and Malone were inside. Malone admitted to hitting his daughters, clothed and unclothed, with his hand and belt, and he admitted that he beat a naked K.M. with a belt while a sock was stuffed in her mouth. Malone, however, denied all allegations of sexual abuse. In essence then, the case turned on whether the jury believed K.M.'s testimony of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>Even based on our review of the cold record, it is clear to us that K.M.'s testimony provided a vivid and descriptive account of years of sexual abuse by her father. The jury was able to observe K.M. as she recited the times in which her father allowed her to \"redeem herself\" by performing oral sex on him or by allowing him to have intercourse with her. The jury saw her face as she described the \"favors\" her father asked her to do. The jury heard K.M. testify that her father had cuffed her in the head, saying \"Don't bite my shit,\" when she accidentally bit his penis. The jury heard her describe the beatings and the accounts of oral sex performed upon her father while pornographic movies were playing in the background. And the jury decided that with regard to the central question before itwhether Malone had raped and sexually assaulted his daughterK.M., and not Malone, was believable.</p>\n<p>The jury decided that K.M. was credible even though it was abundantly clear that K.M. had provided varying accounts as to some of the details of the assaults. Defense counsel highlighted many of these inconsistencies through cross-examination of K.M., Brenda, and Whitney. Indeed, of the eight \"inconsistencies\" that defense counsel listed in his offer of proof, defense counsel highlighted all but one of the inconsistencies on cross-examination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The Effectiveness of the Defense and the Potential Impeachment Value of Gomsey's Testimony</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Malone contends that Gomsey's testimony would have impeached K.M. because Gomsey would have testified that K.M.'s testimony was inconsistent with what K.M. told Gomsey. Defense counsel did, however, effectively attack K.M. with all but one of the alleged inconsistencies that Malone contends would have come out had Gomsey testified. Defense counsel confronted K.M. with the reports' statements that: (1) Tony never came home during a sexual assault, even though K.M. testified that Tony came home during a physical assault; (2) K.M. was physically assaulted, and not sexually assaulted, on Christmas Day 1998, and during cross-examination K.M. admitted that she had only reported the physical abuse to Gomsey; (3) Malone was clothed during the incident in which Brenda came home and nearly caught K.M. and Malone in a sexual act, and when confronted with this on cross-examination, K.M. denied telling Gomsey that Malone was clothed; and (4) Malone had offered the pager for one week of silence and the cell phone for three months of silence, and not one day and three weeks, respectively, as K.M. testified, and on cross-examination, K.M. denied telling Gomsey about her father's offer. Defense counsel also confronted K.M. regarding events to which she testified that were omitted from Gomsey's reports. The reports fail to mention that (5) Malone offered to pay $3,000 every three months in exchange for K.M.'s permanent silence, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> but K.M. insisted on cross-examination that she did tell Gomsey about the $3,000; (6) a pornographic tape was playing during the first sexual assault, but K.M., on cross-examination, insisted that such a tape was playing during the assault and that she had told Gomsey about it; and (7) Malone threatened to kill K.M. after the first incident of sexual abuse, whereas K.M. testified on cross-examination that she \"made sure\" that Gomsey knew about the threat after the first incident. Of all the \"inconsistencies\" listed by the defense counsel in his offer of proof, only (8) was not touched upon at all during K.M.'s cross examination: the report's failure to mention that Malone made K.M. \"earn\" her limousine ride by performing oral sex and having sexual intercourse with him; counsel failed to question K.M. about that omission on cross-examination.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Additional inconsistencies in K.M.'s trial testimony also were highlighted through the testimony and cross-examination of Brenda and Whitney. Brenda testified that K.M. had told her that Malone had told K.M. to wait at least three months before telling Brenda about the abuse, whereas K.M. testified that her father had given her his pager for one day of silence and his cell phone for three weeks of silence. (Gomsey's report comports with Brenda's testimony, stating that Malone had promised K.M. his cell phone for \"three months of silence.\") Brenda also contradicted her daughter's testimony regarding details in connection with the sexual assault that occurred after K.M. stayed out too late and Malone \"offered\" her the chance to \"redeem herself\": K.M. testified that her father picked her up when she was out late one night, whereas Brenda testified that K.M.'s friend's mother picked up K.M.</p>\n<p>K.M.'s younger sister's testimony was also inconsistent with K.M.'s testimony in some respects. Whitney testified that she remembered seeing her father the day after Christmas 1998, whereas K.M. testified that her father raped her on Christmas Day 1998. Even after reviewing Gomsey's report to refresh her recollection, K.M. stated that she did not remember telling Gomsey it was the day after Christmas. (Gomsey's report states that an incident with K.M. and Malone occurred \"[t]he day after Christmas 1998 or near that time.\")</p>\n<p>Defense counsel even extracted an admission from K.M. that the details of her stories were not always consistent. When asked about what she said during her interviews with Gomsey, K.M. admitted that she \"was not too good with memory,\" or at \"remembering exactly what she said.\"</p>\n<p>The defense was sufficiently effective in challenging K.M.'s credibility based upon her inconsistencies that the prosecution felt compelled to address directly K.M.'s credibility in its closing argument. The prosecutor acknowledged that K.M.'s testimony concerning various details was not always consistent, and argued that</p>\n<blockquote>for us to sit here in judgment and to say, [\"]You don't know the exact dates and times, you don't know how you've gotten to the car or who picked you up from a certain time and place[\"] is not reasonable. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> It's not even logical. It doesn't even make common sense, to think that she would be able to decipher between each and every time that this man raped her[.]</blockquote>\n<p>The jury knew full well that K.M. had told inconsistent stories regarding various details of the rapes. K.M., the defense, and the prosecution all acknowledged as much to the jury.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>The Totality of the Evidence</i>\n</h2>\n<p>After reviewing the totality of the evidence before the jury, we conclude that the potential impeachment value of Gomsey's testimony would not have significantly undermined K.M.'s credibility. Although we have noted that \"a significant factor weighing in favor of finding prejudice is the absence of any corroborating evidence other than the testimony of the witness whom defense counsel failed to impeach,\" <i>Stephens,</i> 294 F.3d at 225 (citing <i>Gonzalez-Soberal,</i> 244 F.3d at 278), here, defense counsel did not fail to impeach K.M. And the jury was repeatedly presented with K.M.'s inconsistent statements, inconsistencies that the prosecution acknowledged. The jury nevertheless found K.M. credible regarding the allegations of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>Moreover, calling Gomsey to testify would have come with a price. Gomsey's report states that she knew K.M. through working at K.M.'s middle school and that she \"kn[e]w [K.M.] to be a good person and to my knowledge had always been truthful with me.\" As the state court noted, given that \"Officer Gomsey's potential testimony would have been cumulative of testimony already in evidence,\" Malone may well have benefitted from her absence. <i>See Malone,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">31890964</span></span>, at *1. That is, as the trial judge told Malone's counsel, and the state appellate court quoted approvingly, Malone \"obtained from the complaining witness the inconsistencies that were described to the officer, without permitting the officer to testify as to everything else that was told[.]\" <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>Therefore, we conclude that the state court's decision that Malone was not prejudiced by his counsel's failure to call Gomsey was not an unreasonable application of <i>Strickland.</i> While unreasonableness may, at times, be \"difficult to define,\" <i>McCambridge v. Hall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200144\"><a href=\"/opinion/200144/mccambridge-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc), we have no difficulty in concluding in this case that the state court did not commit AEDPA error. We cannot say that the state court's decision was unreasonable in the independent and objective judgment of this court. In fact, we agree with the state court. Gomsey's failure to testify does not undermine our confidence in the outcome of Malone's trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Because the state court did not unreasonably apply the <i>Strickland</i> standard to the facts of Malone's case, its determination that Malone was not prejudiced by his counsel's failure to subpoena Gomsey was not error under the AEDPA.</p>\n<p>The district court's denial of Malone's habeas petition is</p>\n<p>AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2), Harold W. Clarke has been substituted for his predecessor Kathleen M. Dennehy, as Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p>[**]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Because this case turns on whether Malone was prejudiced by his counsel's failure to call Officer Gomsey and counsel's alleged subsequent failure to impeach K.M., it is necessary to describe K.M.'s testimony in some detail in order properly to assess the prejudice issue.</p>\n<p>[2]  Under Massachusetts law at the time of Malone's trial, the \"fresh complaint\" doctrine provided \"an exception to the usual rule that a prior statement of a witness that is merely repetitive of the witness's trial testimony is not admissible except in limited circumstances, such as on redirect examination to rehabilitate the witness after impeachment on a claim of recent contrivance.\" <i>See </i><i>Commonwealth v. King,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1175</span></span>, 1187-90 (2005) (discussing the history and application of the fresh complaint doctrine). The doctrine allows the prosecution to rebut any inference that the alleged victim of a sexual assault is fabricating evidence by allowing evidence from a \"fresh complaint\" witness that the victim did, in fact, complain while the assault was still \"fresh.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  At the time of Malone's trial it was generally a trial judge's practice to limit the number of fresh complaint witnesses, but the judge had the discretion to allow more than one fresh complaint witness. However, in <i>King,</i> 834 N.E.2d at 1197-98, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") adopted a fresh complaint rule that now, as a general matter, limits such testimony to one witness  the first person told of the assault, <i>see id.</i> at 1198 (allowing a judge, in limited circumstances, to permit the testimony of a fresh complaint witness who was not the first person told of the assault where, for example, the \"first person told of the alleged assault is unavailable, incompetent, or too young to testify meaningfully\"). The changes in the Massachusetts fresh complaint doctrine apply prospectively to only those sexual assault cases tried after the issuance of the opinion. <i>See id.</i> at 1201. Malone's trial occurred prior to <i>King</i>'s one fresh complaint witness rule.</p>\n<p>[4]  Brenda also testified about other physical abuse, stating that she had seen bruises on K.M.'s thighs and buttocks, and had witnessed Malone hitting K.M. with a belt.</p>\n<p>[5]  On appeal, Malone provides two additional inconsistencies, which were not included in defense counsel's offer of proof, that could have been explored had Gomsey testified:\n</p>\n<p>(1) During cross-examination, K.M. denied ever reporting to Gomsey that Malone had ripped off her clothes during an incident at Uncle Tony's house, whereas the report stated that during the incident that occurred when Uncle Tony came home, Malone choked K.M. and began to rip off her clothes.</p>\n<p>(2) Gomsey's report stated that K.M.'s school had called the house because she had detention and because her progress report was bad. According to the report, Malone offered K.M. a chance to \"redeem herself\" by performing oral sex. During cross-examination, K.M. denied telling Gomsey that the progress report and detention occurred at the same time.</p>\n<p>[6]  The highest state court, the SJC, summarily denied Malone's habeas claim, <i>see </i><i>Malone,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1104</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></span>, therefore, we \"look through\" to \"the last reasoned decision,\" which is the decision of the Massachusetts Appeals Court. <i>Gunter v. Maloney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199936\"><a href=\"/opinion/199936/gunter-v-maloney/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <i>Ylst v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span> (1991)).</p>\n<p>[7]  Under <i>Saferian,</i> the petitioner \"must demonstrate that there `has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,'\" and if that is found, the petitioner \"must show that such behavior `has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.'\" <i>Commonwealth v. Sargent,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></span>, 610 (2007) (quoting <i>Saferian,</i> 315 N.E.2d at 883). We have concluded that <i>Saferian</i>'s \"depriving the defendant of an otherwise available substantial ground of defense\" prong subsumes <i>Strickland</i>'s prejudice prong. <i>See </i><i>Ouber,</i> 293 F.3d at 32 (\"[T]he SJC has concluded that <i>Saferian</i> is at least as solicitous of Sixth Amendment rights as <i>Strickland.</i>\"); <i>accord </i><i>Stephens v. Hall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200011\"><a href=\"/opinion/200011/stephens-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 214-15 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>[8]  Even the two additional inconsistencies that Malone raises for the first time on appeal were addressed at trial. Malone's counsel asked K.M. whether she had told Gomsey that her father began to rip off her clothes during the assault in which Tony came home, and K.M. denied telling that to Gomsey. Defense counsel also questioned K.M. about whether K.M. had told Gomsey that Malone's offer to \"redeem herself\" was in connection with the school calling home because K.M. had received detention and an unfavorable progress report, and K.M. denied telling Gomsey that the progress report and detention occurred at the same time.</p>\n\n</div>",
