Records 1981), so, too, negotiations and\n          \n\nbinding contracts readily can be confused.  The lyrics follow.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Plaintiff-appellant    Crellin    Technologies,    Inc.\n\n(Cretco), a Rhode Island corporation, sells, rents, services, and\n\nprovides  parts  for  lift trucks  and  other  materials handling\n\nequipment.   In 1990, Crellin  suffered from a serious  cash flow\n\nmalady.  In order to  stanch the financial hemorrhaging caused by\n\nsteep monthly payments to institutional lenders, Richard Crellin,\n\nCretco's  chief executive officer and part owner, began exploring\n\nvarious  options.   Crellin knew  that,  on occasion,  defendant-\n\nappellee Equipmentlease Corporation (ELC),  a Massachusetts firm,\n\nhad  provided  financing  for   certain  of  Cretco's  customers.\n\nConsequently, Crellin  sought to interest an  ELC representative,\n\nMark  Patterson, in  structuring a sale  and leaseback.1   Cretco\n\nproposed to  sell its fleet of lift trucks  to ELC and then lease\n\nback the  fleet, keeping the  equipment available for use  in the\n\nordinary course of  Cretco's business.   Cretco planned to  apply\n\nsome or  all of the  sale proceeds to pay  down its institutional\n\ndebt,  thereby easing  the  cash flow  crunch  and enhancing  the\n\nprospect that its principal  lender, Old Stone Bank  (Old Stone),\n\n                    \n\n     1Patterson, who worked out of ELC's Rhode Island office, was\na  friend  of  Richard Crellin's  brother,  Douglas  Crellin, and\npreviously had done business with Cretco.\n\n                                2\n\nwould provide long-term financing on less onerous terms.\n\n          After reviewing what it  thought were Cretco's complete\n\nfinancial   statements,2   ELC  agreed   that   a  sale/leaseback\n\ntransaction might  prove  feasible.   In  November of  1990,  ELC\n\nprepared  the   paperwork  that  it  needed  to  start  a  formal\n\ncommitment process.  But ELC's overtures went unrequited, for Old\n\nStone  had not  agreed to  release its  security interest  in the\n\nfleet.  Thus, Cretco refused to sign ELC's documents.\n\n          During  the period from November 1990 to February 1991,\n\nCretco and ELC  maintained an ongoing dialogue.   Although Cretco\n\nnow  portrays these communications  as reassurances that  ELC was\n\ncommitted to a  sale and leaseback,  the trial court  supportably\n\nfound them to be mere expressions of a continuing mutual interest\n\ndirected toward finding agreeable terms on which to do a  deal of\n\nsome undetermined magnitude.\n\n          In February  of 1991,  Cretco made its  peace with  Old\n\nStone and received the long-awaited  agreement for release of the\n\nbank's security interest.  Cretco relayed the good news to ELC on\n\nor about March  1, and requested a  meeting.  On March  11, 1991,\n\nRichard Crellin  travelled  to  ELC's  Worcester  (Massachusetts)\n\noffice and signed papers prepared by ELC.   At the same time, ELC\n\n                    \n\n     2When Cretco submitted financial data  to ELC in the fall of\n1990,  it  omitted  certain relevant  segments  of  its financial\nhistory  and  projections.    The  omitted  material  would  have\nrevealed both  a lower  net worth and  a decreased  likelihood of\nfuture  profitability.  At  trial, the district  judge found that\nthis  omission  came  about  through  inadvertence,  not  through\nintentional  misrepresentation.     Nevertheless,  the  financial\nstatements, as presented, were both misleading and incomplete.\n\n                                3\n\nexecuted   subordination  and   option  agreements   prepared  by\n\nCretco.3\n\n          The  parties dispute  the legal  significance of  these\n\nevents.   In  one corner,  Cretco contends  that, in the  March 1\n\ncall, Richard  Crellin gave the  green light to  consummating the\n\nsale/leaseback  contract  negotiated   between  the  parties   in\n\nNovember  1990     and  that  he  reinforced  this  clearance  by\n\nexecuting  the documents proffered  to him on  March 11.   In the\n\nopposing corner, ELC contends that neither the March 1  telephone\n\nconversation nor the  March 11 signing carried  any legal weight;\n\nthe call was purely informational and the documents were designed\n\nmerely to restart the formal commitment process for a new, albeit\n\nresurrected,  sale  and  leaseback.    ELC  points out  that  the\n\nproffered   papers  were  in  different  dollar  amounts  and  on\n\ndifferent terms than  the documents  prepared in  late 1990,  and\n\nthat, at any rate, it never signed them.\n\n          The record is at sixes and sevens regarding the reasons\n\nwhy ELC applied  the brakes.  Richard Crellin  testified that ELC\n\nled him to believe that the documents would  be signed soon after\n\nMarch 11, and Cretco viewed ELC's failure to do so as a breach of\n\ncontract.   ELC's witnesses  told a much  different story.   They\n\nsaid ELC  informed  Richard Crellin  that,  in pursuance  of  its\n\ncustomary practice, the document  package had to be submitted  to\n\nELC's  funding source,  BayBank, for  approval  before ELC  would\n\n                    \n\n     3Unless and until a sale and leaseback transpired, these two\ndocuments were meaningless;  neither of them had  any independent\nforce.\n\n                                4\n\nenter a  firm agreement.   According to these witnesses,  a final\n\nset  of contract documents  ultimately would have  been generated\n\nif, having  been assured  that funds  were available,  management\n\nmade a binding decision to do the deal.\n\n          It  is undisputed that ELC approached BayBank to supply\n\nthe   needed  funds,  and   that  BayBank  turned   thumbs  down.\n\nThereafter,  ELC requested additional information from Cretco and\n\nsubmitted a revised  request.  BayBank again refused  to open the\n\npurse  strings,  reportedly  due  to  Cretco's  anemic  financial\n\nstatus.  It was for this reason, then, that ELC decided not to go\n\nforward with a sale and leaseback.\n\n          To   make  a  tedious   tale  tolerably  terse,  Cretco\n\neventually invited  ELC to honor  what it perceived as  a binding\n\ncontract.  ELC declined  the invitation, saying that no  contract\n\never existed.  Invoking diversity jurisdiction,  28 U.S.C.   1332\n\n(1988), Cretco sued  ELC in the United States  District Court for\n\nthe District of  Rhode Island.  It charged,  inter alia, that ELC\n                                                       \n\nignored a binding  obligation,4 dishonored  the implied  covenant\n\nof  good  faith  and  fair   dealing  that  formed  part  of  the\n\ncontractual  relationship, and  violated  a Massachusetts  unfair\n\ntrade practices statute by deceptive dealing.\n\n                    \n\n     4At various times, Cretco has argued either that a bilateral\ncontract underpinned  the breach of  contract count   ELC  made a\nfirm offer in  November of 1990 and Cretco accepted  the offer at\nthat time, subject  to a condition (the procuring  of Old Stone's\nconsent)  that   was  fulfilled   the  following   March      or,\nalternately, that  ELC extended  a unilateral  offer, subject  to\nCretco's later acceptance.  Whichever way the scenario is viewed,\nthe upshot of the litigation remains unaffected.\n\n                                5\n\n          After  a bench  trial, the  district  judge found  that\n\nappellant had not  proven any of its three claims.  On the breach\n\nof contract  count, the judge  determined that there had  been no\n\nmutuality of obligation and, therefore, no binding  contract.  In\n\nthis vein, he noted, inter alia, that Cretco had not purported to\n                               \n\nmake a timely acceptance of ELC's  proposal; that, throughout the\n\nnegotiations,  Cretco endeavored to keep any agreement contingent\n\nupon  its  ability  to  secure new  (and  more  manageable)  bank\n\nfinancing; that  Cretco could  not  have sold  the fleet  without\n\nfirst  obtaining  Old  Stone's  consent to  the  release  of  its\n\nsecurity interest    a consent that did not  materialize in 1990;\n\nthat, before litigation  became an option  of choice, Cretco  had\n\nnot viewed  the  November 1990  documents  as binding;  and  that\n\nCretco  had shopped  around in  the ensuing  months for  a better\n\ninterest rate.   The  judge found  that ELC,  too,  had kept  its\n\npowder  dry,  for it  intended  all  along    though  it  had not\n\ninformed Cretco about  this contingency in the fall  of 1990   to\n\ncondition any sale and leaseback upon approval by its own funding\n\nsource.  Hence, since both parties believed the transaction to be\n\ncontingent upon other occurrences, controllable by them   Cretco,\n\nfor example,  did not have to  accede to Old Stone's  terms, and,\n\nsimilarly, ELC  did not have  to accede to the  terms demanded by\n\nits funding source   mutuality of obligation did not exist.\n\n          In  a commendable effort  to cover the  waterfront, the\n\njudge  identified  an  alternative  ground   for  dismissing  the\n\ncontract claim.  Even if one assumed, for argument's sake, that a\n\n                                6\n\ncontract had  been formed  and that ELC  had broken  it, Cretco's\n\nfirst  count  sought  only  compensatory  damages,  not  specific\n\nperformance, and  Cretco  had  not proven  that  it  suffered  or\n\nsustained any recoverable damages.\n\n          Cretco's other two counts  fared no better.  In  regard\n\nto good faith and fair  dealing, the judge reasoned that, because\n\nno enforceable contract  existed, there could be no  breach of an\n\nimplied covenant arising out of that non-contract.  As to chapter\n\n93A, the judge found that the deceptive practices of which Cretco\n\ncomplained, if they occurred at all,  did not occur in the course\n\nof  trade or  commerce,  and, therefore,  did not  transgress the\n\ncited statute.\n\n          Cretco appeals.  We affirm.\n\nII.  THE BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM\n\n          We divide our  discussion of this issue  into segments,\n\nfirst addressing choice of law and then confronting the merits of\n\nappellant's claim.\n\n                        A.  Choice of Law.\n                                         \n\n          It  is, of  course,  a  black-letter  rule  that  state\n\nsubstantive law  must be  applied by a  federal court  sitting in\n\ndiversity jurisdiction.  See Erie  R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n64, 78 (1938).  In determining what state law pertains, the court\n\nmust employ the choice-of-law framework of the forum state, here,\n\nRhode Island.  See Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n487, 491 (1941);  Putnam Resources v. Pateman, 958  F.2d 448, 464\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir.  1992).  Choice-of-law  judgments are legal  in nature,\n\n                                7\n\nand  courts  of  appeals exercise  plenary  oversight  in respect\n\nthereto.   See Soo Line  R.R. Co. v.  Overton, 992 F.2d  640, 643\n                                             \n\n(7th  Cir.  1993); Waggoner  v.  Snow, Becker,  Kroll,  Klaris, &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nKrauss,  991 F.2d 1501,  1505 (9th Cir.  1993); Putnam Resources,\n                                                                \n\n958 F.2d at  466.   Consequently, a  de novo  standard of  review\n                                            \n\nobtains.5 \n\n          1.    The Local  Landscape.    Rhode  Island law  anent\n          1.    The Local  Landscape.\n                                    \n\ncontract  conflict-of-law  principles  is sparse  and  leaves the\n\nproper  choice-of-law   test  for  contract  cases   shrouded  in\n\nuncertainty.  In  1969, Rhode Island's highest court  made use of\n\nthe lex  loci contractus doctrine  in such a context.   See Union\n                                                                 \n\nSav. Bank v. DeMarco, 254 A.2d 81, 83 (R.I. 1969) (holding a loan\n                    \n\ngranted  in Massachusetts to be a Massachusetts contract governed\n\nby Massachusetts law).   Three years later the  court, when asked\n\nto endorse  the neoteric  interest-weighing approach to  contract\n\nconflict  issues as enunciated in the Restatement (Second) of the\n\nConflict  of  Laws     188  (1971)  (hereinafter  \"Restatement\"),\n\nexpressly declined to choose between  the new and the old choice-\n\nof-law rules.  See A.C. Beals Co. v. Rhode Island Hosp., 292 A.2d\n                                                       \n\n865, 871 n.5 (R.I. 1972).  Two subsequent Rhode Island cases that\n\ntouch upon the  question transmit mixed signals.   In Matarese v.\n                                                              \n\nCalise, 305  A.2d 112 (R.I.  1973), a case  calling for  a choice\n      \n\nbetween local law and the  law of a foreign sovereign,  the court\n\ncited with approval a statement favoring resort to the law of the\n\n                    \n\n     5In this case  the district court,  while leaving spoor  for\nthe cognoscenti, made no explicit  choice of law.  We, therefore,\nwrite on a pristine page.\n\n                                8\n\nplace  of  contracting.

Two decades later, the court\n\nindicated a preference  for an interest-weighing analysis.6   See\n                                                                 \n\nGordon v.

Some have invoked the\n\nlaw  of  the  place of  contracting,  see,  e.g., Everett/Charles\n                                                                 \n\nContact Prods.,  Inc. v.

For ease in reference, we\nemploy the term \"interest-weighing.\"\n\n                                9\n\ncontracting  is the  place in which  the last act  that forms the\n\ncontract is performed.  See Tim Hennigan Co. v. Anthony A. Nunes,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., 437 A.2d  1355, 1357 (R.I.  1981); A.C. Beals, 292  A.2d at\n                                                   \n\n870-71.  Counsel  for Cretco maintained at oral  argument in this\n\ncourt that  the contract  solidified on or  about March  1, 1991,\n\nwhen  Richard Crellin  telephoned ELC  to relay  the news  of Old\n\nStone's  agreement  to  release  its  security  interest.    This\n\ntelephone call originated in Rhode Island.  Thus, even though ELC\n\nreceived  the call  in Massachusetts, the  final act  of contract\n\nformation took  place in Rhode Island.  The  rule is that, when a\n\ncontract  is cinched  in  the course  of an  interstate telephone\n\ncall, the contract will be deemed to  have been made in the state\n\nwhere the decisive words were spoken.   See, e.g., Perry v. Mount\n                                                                 \n\nHope Iron Co., 5 A. 632,  633 (R.I. 1886) (holding that an  offer\n             \n\naccepted by telegraph will  be deemed accepted where  telegram is\n\nsent, not where  it is received); see  also John E. Murray,  Jr.,\n                                           \n\nMurray  on Contracts    47G,  at  152 (3d  ed. 1990)  (explaining\n                    \n\nproper rule  for acceptance of offer by  telephone; where parties\n\nare at a distance, \"acceptance  will have occurred where and when\n\nthe acceptance was spoken  or sent\").  Hence, under  the place of\n\ncontracting  rule,  Rhode Island  law  applies to  the  breach of\n\ncontract count.\n\n          The functional  interest-weighing approach  to conflict\n\nanalysis  for  contract  issues yields  the  same  result.   This\n\napproach  requires a court  to take cognizance  of overall policy\n\ngoals  even as  it  evaluates the  significance  of the  parties'\n\n                                10\n\ncontacts  with various  jurisdictions  and  their  conduct  as  a\n\ncontract  is   negotiated,  consummated,  and  performed.     See\n                                                                 \n\nRestatement     6,  188.   On  the policy  side, the  Restatement\n\nsuggests that a  court inquiring into choice of  law consider (1)\n\nthe needs of the interstate  system; (2) relevant policies of the\n\nforum; (3) policies of  other affected states and  their interest\n\nin the outcome of the  litigation; (4) protection of the parties'\n\njustified expectations;  (5)  uniformity  and  predictability  of\n\nresults;  and  (6)  ease in  determining  and  applying different\n\nbodies  of   law,  see  id.      6.    This  panoply   of  policy\n                           \n\nconsiderations is to be assessed against a more traditional, more\n\nconcrete backdrop comprised  of (1) the place of contracting; (2)\n\nthe situs of negotiations; (3)  the place of performance; (4) the\n\nlocation, if any,  of the contract's subject matter;  and (5) the\n\nbusiness  locations and  states  of  incorporation  of  corporate\n\nparties, see id.   188.7\n                \n\n          Under   an   interest-weighing   analysis,  appellant's\n\n                    \n\n     7Choice of law in a contract case requires a court to make a\nthreshold determination as  to the efficacy of  any choice-of-law\nprovision  that  the parties  may have  included in  the contract\ndocuments.  Here, the  draft lease submitted by ELC  to Cretco in\nNovember  1990   contained  a  provision  for   construction  and\nenforcement  according to Massachusetts  law.  We  disregard this\nprovision  for three  reasons.   First, Cretco  never signed  the\ndocument in question, and the provision did not reappear in later\ndocuments.   Second,  neither party  mentioned  the provision  in\nappellate  briefs nor  argued  that it  should  be given  effect.\nThird, while  section 187  of the  Restatement indicates  that an\neffective  choice-of-law   provision  in   a  contract   document\ngenerally  should be respected, that rule  \"is applicable only in\nsituations where  it is  established to the  satisfaction of  the\nforum that the parties  have chosen the state [to  be the source]\nof the applicable law.\"  Restatement    187, cmt. a.  This is not\nsuch a case.\n\n                                11\n\ncontract claim  is governed  by Rhode  Island law.   Cretco is  a\n\nRhode  Island   corporation.     ELC,  albeit   headquartered  in\n\nMassachusetts, maintains  an office in Providence,  Rhode Island.\n\nCretco   initiated   and   continued  negotiations   with   ELC's\n\nrepresentative,  Mark   Patterson,  in  Providence.8     Although\n\nperformance  of the sought-after contract would have overspread a\n\nwide geographic area, the cash infusion generated by the sale and\n\nleaseback was to have taken place in Rhode Island and was to have\n\nbeen used in  large part to  retire debt owed  to a Rhode  Island\n\nlender.  The fleet would continue to be based in Rhode Island and\n\nto be monitored by Cretco's Rhode Island headquarters.\n\n          In  addition,  an  application  of  Rhode   Island  law\n\nfurthers  the general principles  and policy goals  limned in the\n\nRestatement.   Rhode  Island  is  the  forum state.    It  has  a\n\nlegitimate stake in the outcome of the suit:  Cretco is domiciled\n\nin Rhode Island  and its  economic viability  is at  risk.   This\n\ninterest clearly  outweighs Massachusetts'  interest in  the suit\n\n(which  is limited  to  the  impact  of one  soured  relationship\n\nbetween an  in-state defendant and  one of its  many out-of-state\n\nclients).   The  combination  of  appellant's  home  base,  ELC's\n\npresence  in  Rhode  Island, and  the  incidence  of negotiations\n\ninvolving  a Rhode Island  representative of ELC  should have led\n\nthoughtful parties to expect  that Rhode Island law would  govern\n\ntheir dealings.   Last, the law of the forum,  other things being\n\n                    \n\n     8After the  initial discussions,  negotiations continued  in\nRhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.\n\n                                12\n\nequal, is ordinarily to be  preferred; Rhode Island's is the most\n\nnatural,  and, therefore, the easiest law  for the district court\n\nto apply.   We think it follows that,  under an interest-weighing\n\nanalysis,   the   substantive  law   of  Rhode   Island  controls\n\nappellant's contract claim.\n\n          To recapitulate, regardless whether lex loci contractus\n                                                                 \n\nor an interest-weighing  approach prevails, a Rhode  Island court\n\nwould  apply Rhode Island substantive law to appellant's contract\n\nclaim.   Thus,  the  federal  district  court, sitting  in  Rhode\n\nIsland,  was obliged to  do the same.   In turn,  this court must\n\nalso  utilize Rhode  Island  law    and  we  must do  so  without\n\ndeference to the district court's  construction of that law.  See\n                                                                 \n\nSalve Regina Coll. v. Russell, 111 S. Ct. 1217, 1221 (1991).\n                             \n\n                         B.  The Merits.\n                                       \n\n          The  district judge, sitting without a jury, found that\n\nthe end product of the negotiations between Cretco and ELC lacked\n\nmutuality of obligation,  and, consequently, did not  achieve the\n\nstatus of  a contract.  Appellant polemicizes  the court's ruling\n\nthat  no  enforceable  contract  existed  between   the  parties,\n\nclaiming  that the court grossly undervalued the evidence showing\n\nthat  ELC actively demonstrated  its continuing interest  in, and\n\ncommitment to, a sale and leaseback.\n\n          1.  Standard  of Review.  When  a case is tried  to the\n          1.  Standard  of Review.\n                                 \n\nbench,  we  review  the  trial  court's  findings  of  fact  with\n\nconsiderable  solicitude,  disturbing  those  findings  only  for\n\nmistake of law  or clear error.  See Cumpiano v. Banco Santander,\n                                                                \n\n                                13\n\n902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st  Cir. 1990); Reliance Steel Prods.

To be  sure, appellant strives  to\n    \n\nblunt the  force of  this rule by  pointing out that  mistakes of\n\nstate law are subject to  plenary review, see Salve Regina Coll.,\n                                                                \n\n111 S. Ct.  at 1221, and  then dressing quintessentially  factual\n\nmatters in the  garb of  \"legal error.\"   But factual issues  are\n\ndemonstrably different than legal issues,  and no amount of slick\n\ncostumery can transform the one into the other.\n\n          We have consistently held that, so long as the evidence\n\ndoes not point unerringly in a single direction but is capable of\n\nsupporting conflicting  inferences,  the question  of  whether  a\n\ncontract has  been formed  between two parties  is a  question of\n\nfact  to be  determined by  the factfinder.   See,  e.g., Bushkin\n                                                                 \n\nAssocs., Inc. v.

Here,  appellant's  argument\n\ncenters around the issue of contract formation and questions  the\n\ndistrict court's findings  anent mutuality of obligation.   These\n\nquestions  are appropriately  classified  as questions  of  fact,\n\nsubject  to clear-error review.   Within this paradigm, a finding\n\nconcerning a  party's intent  to contract is  a finding  of fact.\n\nSee Gel  Systems, Inc. v. Hyundai  Eng'g &amp; Constr.

While such an issue does present  a \"mixed\" question,\n\nmixed questions, to  the extent that they are fact-dominated, are\n\nsubject to  clear-error review,  not de novo  review.  See  In re\n                                                                 \n\nHoward, 996 F.2d 1320, 1328 (1st Cir. 1993); Roland M. v.

Therefore, unless appellant can  show that the\n\ndistrict court  incorrectly applied  a legal  rule or  standard  \n\nand, here, no such mistake of law looms   the court's findings in\n\nregard  to mutuality  must  be upheld  so long  as  they are  not\n\nclearly erroneous.

As to ELC, the court found that it intended agreement\n\nto await  approval by one  of its  funding sources    an approval\n\nthat never materialized.  This finding is amply supported.  After\n\nall, ELC  never signed  the documents it  proffered to  Cretco in\n\n1990.  The next spring, ELC declined to sign the new set of lease\n\ndocuments.   At that  time, ELC asked  for, and  Cretco supplied,\n\nadditional  financial  information   for  the  sole  purpose   of\n\nattempting  to  convince  BayBank,  an  ELC  funding  source,  to\n\nunderwrite the  transaction.  The  record is  barren of  evidence\n\nthat ELC received  a funding commitment at any time.   The record\n\nis similarly barren of evidence  that ELC did major deals without\n\noutside  funding.    These facts  strongly  support  the district\n\n                    \n\n     9From time  to  time,  appellant  shifts gears.    On  those\noccasions, it seems to be  saying that ELC's offer was unilateral\nand remained open  until March 1,  1991, when appellant  accepted\nthe arrangement.   We  cover this  possibility in  Part II(B)(3),\ninfra.\n     \n\n                                16\n\ncourt's finding  that ELC did  not intend to bind  itself through\n\nthe submission of preliminary transactional paperwork in 1990.\n\n          As to Cretco,  the court concluded that it, too, lacked\n\nthe requisite intent to be  bound.  From its standpoint, entering\n\ninto  a binding  contract had  to  await two  developments:   the\n\nextraction  of a  piece of  paper  from Old  Stone and,  in Judge\n\nTorres's  words,  the  obtaining of  \"satisfactory  supplementary\n\nfinancing.\"  We  believe that the court's  subsidiary findings on\n\nthese  points  are sustainable;  indeed,  it was  for  these very\n\nreasons that Cretco refused to  execute the documents tendered to\n\nit in 1990.\n\n          In an  effort  to undermine  the court's  determination\n\nthat it  was not bound,  appellant argues that its  acceptance of\n\nthe November offer required it to  do its utmost to gain the  Old\n\nStone release.  This  argument will not wash.  For  one thing, it\n\nglosses  over the parallel, equally lethal finding that appellant\n\nviewed any relationship  with ELC as subject to  the obtaining of\n\nsupplementary financing (in  amounts, and on terms,  satisfactory\n\nto appellant).   For another  thing, both parties to  a bilateral\n\ncontract  must have  made  more than  illusory  promises for  the\n\nagreement  to be  binding.   See  John D.  Calamari  &amp; Joseph  M.\n                                \n\nPerillo, Contracts    4-17, at 160 (2d ed.  1977).  It is settled\n                  \n\nlaw that, when the promised  act is conditional on the occurrence\n\nof a future event within the control of the promisor, the promise\n\nis illusory.   See Vickers Antone  v. Vickers, 610 A.2d  120, 123\n                                             \n\n(R.I. 1992);  see also Calamari  &amp; Perillo, Contracts    4-17, at\n                                                     \n\n                                17\n\n160.  We see nothing in the 1990 \"Equipment Lease Agreement\" that\n\nwould  indicate that  appellant  bound itself  to have  Old Stone\n\nrelease  its  security interest  in  the  fleet  or to  make  any\n\nparticular efforts  in this  regard.  Moreover,  even if  such an\n\nobligation can somehow be implied out of thin air   and we do not\n\nthink it can be   the documents certainly impose no time limit on\n\nwhen  appellant would  have to  bring about  this event,  or what\n\nconcessions it would have to endure.  Therefore, the procuring of\n\nOld  Stone's   release,  like  the  obtaining   of  supplementary\n\nfinancing, was in appellant's unbridled discretion.  At the most,\n\nthen, appellant gave ELC a mirage of a promise.\n\n          We  add  that  appellant's  actions  belie its  current\n\ncontention  that the parties  were bound in  1990 and thereafter.\n\nDuring  the critical period,  appellant tried valiantly  to forge\n\narrangements with  other lending institutions   arrangements that\n\nwould have left ELC  out in the cold.  Richard  Crellin testified\n\nthat, as late as  February of 1991,  he approached Fleet Bank  to\n\nsee if it would  \"offer a more attractive deal.\"   He admitted on\n\ncross-examination  that he would have looked favorably upon Fleet\n\nreplacing both ELC and  Old Stone in Cretco's plans  had an offer\n\nbeen  forthcoming  on comely  terms.10   Thus,  despite  the fact\n\nthat  appellant  claims  it was  only  scouting  out supplemental\n\nfinancing,  the  evidence  is adequate  to  warrant  the district\n\n                    \n\n     10Mark  Patterson testified that  in early 1991  he believed\nCretco  was  \"shopping  around\" for  better  financing  terms and\nbiding its time  in anticipation of  a lower prime  rate.  It  is\nobvious from  this and other  evidence that ELC knew  of Cretco's\nongoing forays into the financial markets.\n\n                                18\n\ncourt's contrary finding  that appellant continued to  seek other\n\nfinancing options as a surrogate for, rather than as a supplement\n\nto, an  alliance with  ELC.   When, as  in this  case, the  proof\n\nsupports more than one plausible view of the relevant events, and\n\nthe  district  court  chooses one  such  view  over  another, the\n\ncourt's choice cannot be clearly erroneous.  See Anderson v. City\n                                                                 \n\nof  Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574  (1985); Dedham Water Co. v.\n                                                              \n\nCumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                            \n\n          This finding  is significant.   Although  appellant may\n\nhave exercised good business sense  when it shopped the financial\n\nmarkets  for better  terms in  the winter  of 1990-91,  it cannot\n\nplausibly  claim  that   ELC  was  bound   although  it  had   no\n\ncorresponding  obligation.  Given, especially, three things   the\n\ndiscretionary nature of  appellant's \"obligation\" to  procure the\n\nOld Stone  release and  the needed  supplementary financing,  its\n\nconcession that, in and after  November of 1990, it believed that\n\n\"if  it  had  wanted  to,  it  could  have  gone  elsewhere\"  for\n\nfinancing,11  and the  evidence  that  it  acted on  this  stated\n\nbelief   we do not  perceive clear error in the district  court's\n\nfinding that no obligation inured on Cretco's part.\n\n                    \n\n     11Appellant's  counsel  made  the  quoted statement  to  the\ndistrict court in  final argument.  Appellant,  therefore, cannot\ndisclaim the  statement on appeal.   See, e.g., United  States v.\n                                                              \nDietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55  (1st Cir. 1991) (explaining that  a party\n     \nwho,  in hindsight, finds  dissatisfaction with the  arguments he\nadvanced in the  district court \"cannot switch  horses mid-stream\nin hopes of locating a swifter steed\"); see also Patriot Cinemas,\n                                                                 \nInc. v.  General Cinema Corp., 834 F.2d  208, 214 (1st Cir. 1987)\n                             \n(stating that when a litigant \"asserts inconsistent statements of\nfact\"  at  different  junctures in  litigation,  the  doctrine of\n\"judicial estoppel\" prevents unfair advantage).\n\n                                19\n\n          To sum up,  the trial court found that  neither ELC nor\n                                                         \n\nCretco undertook a binding obligation  to the other.  Either half\n\nof this disjunctive finding is sufficient to warrant judgment for\n\nthe defendant on the breach of  contract count.  Both halves  are\n\nsustainable.   Hence, the court's  ultimate conclusion    that no\n\nenforceable contract  existed because no  mutuality of obligation\n\nexisted   is unimpugnable.12\n\n          3.   Unilateral Offer.   Before  leaving the  breach of\n          3.   Unilateral Offer.\n                               \n\ncontract  claim, we close one last door.  Were we to characterize\n\nthe  initial  document  submission  as a  unilateral  offer     a\n\ncharacterization  that  appellant,   for  the   most  part,   has\n\nassiduously resisted   appellant's lot would not be improved.  As\n\nthe district court observed, the documents that  ELC delivered in\n\nNovember 1990 did  not specify a time within  which appellant had\n\nto accept  any offer they  might have contained.   It, therefore,\n\nwould have had  a reasonable time within  which to do so,  for an\n\noffer that does not contain  a deadline for acceptance will lapse\n\nafter a reasonable  time if  it is not  accepted.  See  Mathewson\n                                                                 \n\nCorp. v.

What amount  of time  is\n\nreasonable within the context of  a particular case is \"a classic\n\nexample  of a decision  that the law leaves  to a district court,\n\nnot  to this  court, to  decide.\"  Thermo  Electron, 958  F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n1166; see also Murray on Contracts, supra,   41C, at 102.\n                                         \n\n          Appellant concedes that,  generally, four months is  an\n\nunreasonably long  time for a financing offer to remain open.  We\n\nagree  with the  district  court  that, in  a  period of  rapidly\n\nfluctuating interest rates and with no extenuating circumstances,\n\nthis case falls comfortably within the  sweep of that generality.\n\nBecause  it would have been thoroughly unreasonable for appellant\n\nto believe  that a sale/leaseback  proposal made in  November and\n\nnot then accepted  would linger on the table  until the following\n\nMarch,  a \"unilateral  offer\" theory  leads down  a blind  alley.\n\nAnd, moreover,  we discern  no clear error  in the  trial court's\n\nrejection  of appellant's claim that the \"offer\" was periodically\n\nrefreshed  by what  appellant    but  not the  court    viewed as\n\ncontinuing reassurances.\n\nIII.  THE IMPLIED COVENANT CLAIM\n\n          Appellant  next  claims that  ELC  breached  an implied\n\ncovenant  of good  faith  and  fair dealing  when  it refused  to\n\n                                21\n\nproceed with the alleged contract,  and, adding insult to injury,\n\ngave apocryphal  reasons for  its refusal to  perform.   When, as\n\nnow, a duty  of good faith and  fair dealing is alleged  to arise\n\nfrom a contractual relationship, a  claim for breach of that duty\n\nsounds in contract rather  than in tort.  See Bertrand  v. Quincy\n                                                                 \n\nMarket Cold Storage &amp; Warehouse Co., 728 F.2d 568, 571 (1st  Cir.\n                                   \n\n1984).   This,  in  turn,  dictates  choice of  law:    the  same\n\nsubstantive law that governs the  contract claim also governs the\n\nimplied covenant claim.\n\n          In  this instance,  then,  Rhode  Island law  controls.\n\nRhode Island recognizes that virtually every contract contains an\n\nimplied  covenant  of good  faith  and fair  dealing  between the\n\nparties.  See  A.A.A. Pool Serv. &amp;  Supply, Inc. v. Aetna  Cas. &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nSur. Co., 395  A.2d 724, 725 (R.I. 1978); Ide Farm &amp; Stable, Inc.\n                                                                 \n\nv. Cardi,  297 A.2d  643, 645 (R.I.  1972); see also  Fleet Nat'l\n                                                                 \n\nBank v. Liuzzo,  766 F.  Supp. 61,  67 (D.R.I.  1991); Landry  v.\n                                                             \n\nFarmer, 564 F. Supp. 598, 611 (D.R.I. 1983).  Because the implied\n      \n\ncovenant  exists \"so  that  the  contractual  objectives  may  be\n\nachieved,\" Ide Farm, 297 A.2d at 645, it necessarily follows that\n                   \n\nwhere  there  is  no  contract,  there  is  no  duty.    In  such\n\ncircumstances, there is  nothing from which  the covenant can  be\n\nimplied.   Or,  phrased differently,  the  law does  not  require\n\npersons to  act in particular  ways in order to  achieve illusory\n\ncontractual objectives.\n\n          On this  basis, the  covenant is  left without  visible\n\nmeans of  support, and no claim for a breach of it will lie.  See\n                                                                 \n\n                                22\n\nJordan-Milton Mach., Inc v.

THE UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES CLAIM\n\n          We come, finally, to appellant's unfair trade practices\n\nclaim.   This claim invokes a Massachusetts statute that provides\n\nin relevant part:\n\n               [A]ny person who engages  in the conduct\n          of  any trade or commerce and who suffers any\n          loss of money or  property, real or personal,\n          as  a  result  of the  use  or  employment by\n          another person who  engages in  any trade  or\n          commerce of  an unfair method  of competition\n          or an unfair or deceptive act or practice . .\n          . may,  as  hereinafter  provided,  bring  an\n          action . . . for damages . . . .\n\nMass. Gen. L.  ch. 93A,   11 (1984).  The district court, without\n\nmaking  an  explicit choice-of-law  determination,  dismissed the\n\nclaim on the ground that the interdicted conduct did not occur in\n\ntrade or commerce.\n\n          Appellant's chapter 93A  claim is  really two  separate\n\nbut related  claims.   We  deal with  them seriatim.   The  first\n                                                   \n\ninitiative fails to state  a cause of action even  if chapter 93A\n\napplies,  and we  dispose  of it  on that  basis.13   The  second\n\ninitiative is a horse of a different hue; if chapter 93A applies,\n\nit arguably states  a claim.  Consequently, we  treat the choice-\n\nof-law   question    that   necessarily    precedes   substantive\n\n                    \n\n     13Thus, we make no choice-of-law determination as to whether\nthe substantive law  of Massachusetts would apply  to the conduct\nunderlying this first initiative.\n\n                                23\n\nconsideration of this initiative.\n\n           A.  The First Half of the Chapter 93A Claim.\n                                                      \n\n          Appellant's initial charge    that ELC, by  blaming the\n\ncollapse of the deal on  Cretco's financial plight rather than on\n\nits own  empty coffers, misrepresented its reason for refusing to\n\nproceed  with  the sale  and  leaseback     need not  detain  us.\n\nAlthough Judge Torres  found that ELC had not  informed appellant\n\nthat  its  participation  in  the   deal  would  hinge  upon  the\n\navailability of  funding, there is no credible  evidence that ELC\n\never made express representations to the contrary.  Thus, even if\n\nwe assume the truth of the charge, no reasonable factfinder could\n\nconclude  that ELC's  conduct in  this respect  descended  to the\n\nlevel  of rascality required  for a successful  chapter 93A suit.\n\nSee, e.g.,  Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp.,  851 F.2d 513, 515-16 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1988) (explaining that, \"[i]n Massachusetts, the litmus test\n\nfor  transgression of chapter  93A involves behavior  which falls\n\nwithin  `the  penumbra of  some  .  .  . established  concept  of\n\nunfairness'\") (quoting Massachusetts cases); Levings  v.

The Second Half of the Chapter 93A Claim.\n                                                      \n\n          The  second basis for the appellant's chapter 93A claim\n\narguably consists of  sterner stuff.  During  pretrial discovery,\n\nELC produced a handwritten credit decision memorandum (CDM) dated\n\nNovember 2,  1990.  Attached  to the CDM  was a  note purportedly\n\nwritten to Mark Patterson, advising him that the handwritten memo\n\nsuperseded  a typed  CDM of  the  same vintage.   The  difference\n\nbetween the two  memoranda is of  import.  The  typed CDM  stated\n\nthat  the  sale   and  leaseback  had   been  approved.14     The\n\nhandwritten  version,  however,  conditioned the  approval  on  a\n\nthoroughgoing  review  of  appellant's  financial  status  and  a\n\nfavorable reaction by  an ELC  funding source.   By the time  the\n\ncase  reached trial, appellant  had integrated ELC's gamesmanship\n\nduring  discovery  with  its  other  purported  peccadilloes, and\n\ncharged  that the handwritten CDM  was a fake, manufactured after\n\nthe fact in order to lay the groundwork for ELC's defense.\n\n          Even if we assume, arguendo, that the described conduct\n                                     \n\n                    \n\n     14Although ELC did not produce the typed version in pretrial\ndiscovery, appellant  knew of  its existence  through viewing  an\ninformal file that  Patterson kept at home.

In considering these general principles, tort  conflict-of-\n\nlaw  analysis weighs  more heavily  the needs  of the  interstate\n\nsystem,  the policies  of the  interested states  as well  as the\n\nforum, and the ease of  determination and application of the law.\n\nSee  Restatement    145,  cmt. b.   In  the  tort context,  these\n   \n\noverarching  tenets  may  take into  account  a  number  of other\n\nfactors, including (1)  the place of injury; (2)  the place where\n\nthe conduct  which caused the  injury occurred; (3) the  place of\n\nincorporation and  place of business  of each party; and  (4) the\n\nlocus, or center  of gravity, of the parties'  relationship.  See\n                                                                 \n\nPutnam Resources,  958 F.2d  at 464; Fashion  House, 892  F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n1092; Brown, 252 A.2d at 179; see also Restatement   145(2).\n                                      \n\n          An  application  of these  factors  reveals that  Rhode\n\nIsland has a more significant interest than  Massachusetts in the\n\nresolution  of this claim.  Appellant initiated negotiations with\n\nELC  in Rhode  Island    and interstate  policy does  not dictate\n\nprosecution under the  Massachusetts statute  of every  deceptive\n\ntrade  allegation  brought  against  a  company headquartered  in\n\n                                28\n\nMassachusetts but doing business in  another state.  Rhode Island\n\nhas a substantial  interest in protecting its  resident companies\n\nfrom  deceptive  representations   or  unfair  trade   practices,\n\nespecially those that may occur within its borders.  As it is the\n\nforum state, an  application of Rhode Island's tort  law would be\n\nmore  easily accomplished  than  an application  of Massachusetts\n\nlaw.\n\n          Then, too, in addition to the Rhode Island locus of the\n\nclaimed  injury, the  allegedly tortious  conduct also  possesses\n\nsubstantial links to Rhode Island.   Appellant's claim arose when\n\nDouglas  Crellin visited Mark Patterson at  his Rhode Island home\n\nand  saw the typed version of  the CDM.  The  coverup itself   if\n\none took place   must have been crafted in the course of pretrial\n\ndiscovery in a  Rhode Island forum.   Even if we assume  that the\n\nhandwritten version of the CDM was created in Massachusetts   and\n\nthere is no proof of that fact   such a contact,  standing alone,\n\nwould  not  be enough  to  overcome  Rhode Island's  interest  in\n\ncompensating a Rhode  Island company  whose financial  well-being\n\nwas  compromised  through  deceptive  acts  of  a  company  doing\n\nbusiness within Rhode Island.16\n\n          We  conclude, therefore,  that to the  extent appellant\n\npresents a potentially  viable unfair trade practices  claim, the\n\nclaim  is governed  by  the  substantive  law  of  Rhode  Island.\n\n                    \n\n     16Although they do  not bear repeating, many of  the factors\nthat  dictate   using  Rhode  Island  law  vis-a-vis  appellant's\ncontract claim,  see supra pp.  11-12, also militate in  favor of\n                          \nusing that law vis-a-vis its chapter 93A claim.\n\n                                29\n\nBecause that  is so, appellant's  claim under chapter 93A  is not\n\nactionable.17    See,   e.g.,  Eastland  Bank  v.   Massbank  for\n                                                                 \n\nSavings, 767  F.

Accordingly, we\n                             \n\naffirm the district court's dismissal of this claim on different,\n\nbut  equally  dispositive, grounds,  see  generally Polyplastics,\n                                                                 \n\nInc. v.

CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need go  no further.18     Finding, as we  do, that\n\nappellant mistook mere  negotiations for a binding  contract, and\n\nthat it has no legal recourse against ELC, we uphold the district\n\ncourt's disposition of its suit.\n\n                    \n\n     17Appellant has not pointed to a Rhode Island counterpart to\nchapter 93A, nor  has it identified any theory  grounded in Rhode\nIsland law  under which  its unfair trade  practices claim  might\nprosper.  We, therefore, eschew the temptation to rummage through\nRhode  Island's jurisprudence.  In our estimation, litigants have\nan independent responsibility to do their homework.\n\n     18Our  conclusion that  the  end  product  of  the  parties'\nnegotiations lacked  a necessary element  of contract  formation,\nsee supra  Part II(B),  obviates any need  to consider  the lower\n         \ncourt's  alternative  holding that  the  contract claim  likewise\nfails for want of actual damages.  Similarly, our conclusion that\nELC  is  not  liable  in  any way  eliminates  any  necessity  to\ndetermine  whether  the  lower court  erred  in  excluding expert\ntestimony offered by appellant in an effort to prove damages. \n\n                                30\n\nAffirmed.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellant Crellin Technologies, Inc.  (Cretco), a Rhode Island corporation, sells, rents, services, and provides parts for lift trucks and other materials handling equipment.  In 1990, Crellin suffered from a serious cash flow malady.  In order to stanch the financial hemorrhaging caused by steep monthly payments to institutional lenders, Richard Crellin, Cretco's chief executive officer and part owner, began exploring various options.  Crellin knew that, on occasion, defendant-appellee Equipmentlease Corporation (ELC), a Massachusetts firm, had provided financing for certain of Cretco's customers.  Consequently, Crellin sought to interest an ELC representative, Mark Patterson, in structuring a sale and leaseback.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Cretco proposed to sell its fleet of lift trucks to ELC and then lease back the fleet, keeping the equipment available for use in the ordinary course of Cretco's business.  Cretco planned to apply some or all of the sale proceeds to pay down its institutional debt, thereby easing the cash flow crunch and enhancing the prospect that its principal lender, Old Stone Bank (Old Stone), would provide long-term financing on less onerous terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing what it thought were Cretco's complete financial statements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> ELC agreed that a sale/leaseback transaction might prove feasible.  In November of 1990, ELC prepared the paperwork that it needed to start a formal commitment process.  But ELC's overtures went unrequited, for Old Stone had not agreed to release its security interest in the fleet.  Thus, Cretco refused to sign ELC's documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the period from November 1990 to February 1991, Cretco and ELC maintained an ongoing dialogue.  Although Cretco now portrays these communications as reassurances that ELC was committed to a sale and leaseback, the trial court supportably found them to be mere expressions of a continuing mutual interest directed toward finding agreeable terms on which to do a deal of some undetermined magnitude.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February of 1991, Cretco made its peace with Old Stone and received the long-awaited agreement for release of the bank's security interest.  Cretco relayed the good news to ELC on or about March 1, and requested a meeting.  On March 11, 1991, Richard Crellin travelled to ELC's Worcester (Massachusetts) office and signed papers prepared by ELC.  At the same time, ELC executed subordination and option agreements prepared by Cretco.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties dispute the legal significance of these events.  In one corner, Cretco contends that, in the March 1 call, Richard Crellin gave the green light to consummating the sale/leaseback contract negotiated between the parties in November 1990--and that he reinforced this clearance by executing the documents proffered to him on March 11.  In the opposing corner, ELC contends that neither the March 1 telephone conversation nor the March 11 signing carried any legal weight;  the call was purely informational and the documents were designed merely to restart the formal commitment process for a new, albeit resurrected, sale and leaseback.  ELC points out that the proffered papers were in different dollar amounts and on different terms than the documents prepared in late 1990, and that, at any rate, it never signed them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is at sixes and sevens regarding the reasons why ELC applied the brakes.  Richard Crellin testified that ELC led him to believe that the documents would be signed soon after March 11, and Cretco viewed ELC's failure to do so as a breach of contract.  ELC's witnesses told a much different story.  They said ELC informed Richard Crellin that, in pursuance of its customary practice, the document package had to be submitted to ELC's funding source, BayBank, for approval before ELC would enter a firm agreement.  According to these witnesses, a final set of contract documents ultimately would have been generated if, having been assured that funds were available, management made a binding decision to do the deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that ELC approached BayBank to supply the needed funds, and that BayBank turned thumbs down.  Thereafter, ELC requested additional information from Cretco and submitted a revised request.  BayBank again refused to open the purse strings, reportedly due to Cretco's anemic financial status.  It was for this reason, then, that ELC decided not to go forward with a sale and leaseback.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make a tedious tale tolerably terse, Cretco eventually invited ELC to honor what it perceived as a binding contract.  ELC declined the invitation, saying that no contract ever existed.  Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332 (1988), Cretco sued ELC in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.  It charged, inter alia, that ELC ignored a binding obligation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> ] dishonored the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that formed part of the contractual relationship, and violated a Massachusetts unfair trade practices statute by deceptive dealing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a bench trial, the district judge found that appellant had not proven any of its three claims.  On the breach of contract count, the judge determined that there had been no mutuality of obligation and, therefore, no binding contract.  In this vein, he noted, inter alia, that Cretco had not purported to make a timely acceptance of ELC's proposal;  that, throughout the negotiations, Cretco endeavored to keep any agreement contingent upon its ability to secure new (and more manageable) bank financing;  that Cretco could not have sold the fleet without first obtaining Old Stone's consent to the release of its security interest--a consent that did not materialize in 1990;  that, before litigation became an option of choice, Cretco had not viewed the November 1990 documents as binding;  and that Cretco had shopped around in the ensuing months for a better interest rate.  The judge found that ELC, too, had kept its powder dry, for it intended all along--though it had not informed Cretco about this contingency in the fall of 1990--to condition any sale and leaseback upon approval by its own funding source.  Hence, since both parties believed the transaction to be contingent upon other occurrences, controllable by them--Cretco, for example, did not have to accede to Old Stone's terms, and, similarly, ELC did not have to accede to the terms demanded by its funding source--mutuality of obligation did not exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a commendable effort to cover the waterfront, the judge identified an alternative ground for dismissing the contract claim.  Even if one assumed, for argument's sake, that a contract had been formed and that ELC had broken it, Cretco's first count sought only compensatory damages, not specific performance, and Cretco had not proven that it suffered or sustained any recoverable damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cretco's other two counts fared no better.  In regard to good faith and fair dealing, the judge reasoned that, because no enforceable contract existed, there could be no breach of an implied covenant arising out of that non-contract.  As to chapter 93A, the judge found that the deceptive practices of which Cretco complained, if they occurred at all, did not occur in the course of trade or commerce, and, therefore, did not transgress the cited statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cretco appeals.

See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 822, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938).  In determining what state law pertains, the court must employ the choice-of-law framework of the forum state, here, Rhode Island.  See Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 491, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941);  Putnam Resources v. Pateman, 958 F.2d 448, 464 (1st Cir.1992).  Choice-of-law judgments are legal in nature, and courts of appeals exercise plenary oversight in respect thereto.  See Soo Line R.R. Co. v. Overton, 992 F.2d 640, 643 (7th Cir.1993);  Waggoner v. Snow, Becker, Kroll, Klaris, &amp; Krauss, 991 F.2d 1501, 1505 (9th Cir.1993);  Putnam Resources, 958 F.2d at 466.   Consequently, a de novo standard of review obtains.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Local Landscape.   Rhode Island law anent contract conflict-of-law principles is sparse and leaves the proper choice-of-law test for contract cases shrouded in uncertainty.  In 1969, Rhode Island's highest court made use of the lex loci contractus doctrine in such a context.  See Union Sav. Bank v. DeMarco, 105 R.I. 592, 254 A.2d 81, 83 (1969) (holding a loan granted in Massachusetts to be a Massachusetts contract governed by Massachusetts law).  Three years later the court, when asked to endorse the neoteric interest-weighing approach to contract conflict issues as enunciated in the Restatement (Second) of the Conflict of Laws Sec. 188 (1971) (hereinafter \"Restatement\"), expressly declined to choose between the new and the old choice-of-law rules.  See A.C. Beals Co. v. Rhode Island Hosp., 110 R.I. 275, 292 A.2d 865, 871 n. 5 (1972).  Two subsequent Rhode Island cases that touch upon the question transmit mixed signals.  In Matarese v. Calise, 111 R.I. 551, 305 A.2d 112 (1973), a case calling for a choice between local law and the law of a foreign sovereign, the court cited with approval a statement favoring resort to the law of the place of contracting.  See id. 305 A.2d at 118 n. 4 (dictum;  citing Annotation, 72 A.L.R. 250 (1931)).  Two decades later, the court indicated a preference for an interest-weighing analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Gordon v. Clifford Metal Sales Co., 602 A.2d 535, 539 (R.I.1992) (dictum;  implying approval of rule enunciated in Restatement Sec. 6 for choice of law involving \"a simple contracts issue governed by general contract principles\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal district courts sitting in Rhode Island have spoken to the issue in differing tones.  Some have invoked the law of the place of contracting, see, e.g., Everett/Charles Contact Prods., Inc. v. Gentec, S.A.R.L., 692 F.Supp. 83, 89 (D.R.I.1988);  SW Indus., Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 653 F.Supp. 631, 639 (D.R.I.1987), and some have invoked the interest-weighing test, see, e.g., Marshall Contractors, Inc. v. Peerless Ins. Co., 827 F.Supp. 91, 94 (D.R.I.1993);  Albany Ins. Co. v. Wisniewski, 579 F.Supp. 1004, 1013 (D.R.I.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Discussion.   We need not attempt to resolve this impasse by venturing an informed prophecy as to which test will emerge triumphant in the Rhode Island courts.  Here, providentially, Rhode Island law must prevail under either choice-of-law format.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of the older \"place of contracting\" test, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has held that the place of contracting is the place in which the last act that forms the contract is performed.  See Tim Hennigan Co. v. Anthony A. Nunes, Inc., 437 A.2d 1355, 1357 (R.I.1981);  A.C. Beals, 292 A.2d at 870-71.   Counsel for Cretco maintained at oral argument in this court that the contract solidified on or about March 1, 1991, when Richard Crellin telephoned ELC to relay the news of Old Stone's agreement to release its security interest.  This telephone call originated in Rhode Island.  Thus, even though ELC received the call in Massachusetts, the final act of contract formation took place in Rhode Island.  The rule is that, when a contract is cinched in the course of an interstate telephone call, the contract will be deemed to have been made in the state where the decisive words were spoken.  See, e.g., Perry v. Mount Hope Iron Co., 15 R.I. 380, 5 A. 632, 633 (1886) (holding that an offer accepted by telegraph will be deemed accepted where telegram is sent, not where it is received);  see also John E. Murray, Jr., Murray on Contracts Sec. 47G, at 152 (3d ed. 1990) (explaining proper rule for acceptance of offer by telephone;  where parties are at a distance, \"acceptance will have occurred where and when the acceptance was spoken or sent\").  Hence, under the place of contracting rule, Rhode Island law applies to the breach of contract count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The functional interest-weighing approach to conflict analysis for contract issues yields the same result.  This approach requires a court to take cognizance of overall policy goals even as it evaluates the significance of the parties' contacts with various jurisdictions and their conduct as a contract is negotiated, consummated, and performed.  See Restatement Secs. 6, 188.  On the policy side, the Restatement suggests that a court inquiring into choice of law consider (1) the needs of the interstate system;  (2) relevant policies of the forum;  (3) policies of other affected states and their interest in the outcome of the litigation;  (4) protection of the parties' justified expectations;  (5) uniformity and predictability of results;  and (6) ease in determining and applying different bodies of law, see id. Sec. 6.  This panoply of policy considerations is to be assessed against a more traditional, more concrete backdrop comprised of (1) the place of contracting;  (2) the situs of negotiations;  (3) the place of performance;  (4) the location, if any, of the contract's subject matter;  and (5) the business locations and states of incorporation of corporate parties, see id. Sec. 188.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under an interest-weighing analysis, appellant's contract claim is governed by Rhode Island law.  Cretco is a Rhode Island corporation.  ELC, albeit headquartered in Massachusetts, maintains an office in Providence, Rhode Island.  Cretco initiated and continued negotiations with ELC's representative, Mark Patterson, in Providence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Although performance of the sought-after contract would have overspread a wide geographic area, the cash infusion generated by the sale and leaseback was to have taken place in Rhode Island and was to have been used in large part to retire debt owed to a Rhode Island lender.  The fleet would continue to be based in Rhode Island and to be monitored by Cretco's Rhode Island headquarters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, an application of Rhode Island law furthers the general principles and policy goals limned in the Restatement.  Rhode Island is the forum state.  It has a legitimate stake in the outcome of the suit:  Cretco is domiciled in Rhode Island and its economic viability is at risk.  This interest clearly outweighs Massachusetts' interest in the suit (which is limited to the impact of one soured relationship between an in-state defendant and one of its many out-of-state clients).  The combination of appellant's home base, ELC's presence in Rhode Island, and the incidence of negotiations involving a Rhode Island representative of ELC should have led thoughtful parties to expect that Rhode Island law would govern their dealings.  Last, the law of the forum, other things being equal, is ordinarily to be preferred;  Rhode Island's is the most natural, and, therefore, the easiest law for the district court to apply.  We think it follows that, under an interest-weighing analysis, the substantive law of Rhode Island controls appellant's contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, regardless whether lex loci contractus or an interest-weighing approach prevails, a Rhode Island court would apply Rhode Island substantive law to appellant's contract claim.  Thus, the federal district court, sitting in Rhode Island, was obliged to do the same.  In turn, this court must also utilize Rhode Island law--and we must do so without deference to the district court's construction of that law.  See Salve Regina Coll. v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 230, 111 S.Ct. 1217, 1221, 113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>B. The Merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge, sitting without a jury, found that the end product of the negotiations between Cretco and ELC lacked mutuality of obligation, and, consequently, did not achieve the status of a contract.  Appellant polemicizes the court's ruling that no enforceable contract existed between the parties, claiming that the court grossly undervalued the evidence showing that ELC actively demonstrated its continuing interest in, and commitment to, a sale and leaseback.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Standard of Review.   When a case is tried to the bench, we review the trial court's findings of fact with considerable solicitude, disturbing those findings only for mistake of law or clear error.  See Cumpiano v. Banco Santander, 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990);  Reliance Steel Prods.  Co. v. National Fire Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 575, 576 (1st Cir.1989);  see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).  To be sure, appellant strives to blunt the force of this rule by pointing out that mistakes of state law are subject to plenary review, see Salve Regina Coll., 499 U.S. at 230, 111 S.Ct. at 1221, and then dressing quintessentially factual matters in the garb of \"legal error.\"   But factual issues are demonstrably different than legal issues, and no amount of slick costumery can transform the one into the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have consistently held that, so long as the evidence does not point unerringly in a single direction but is capable of supporting conflicting inferences, the question of whether a contract has been formed between two parties is a question of fact to be determined by the factfinder.  See, e.g., Bushkin Assocs., Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 815 F.2d 142, 145, 151 (1st Cir.1987);  Chedd-Angier Prod.  Co. v. Omni Pub'ns Int'l, Ltd., 756 F.2d 930, 935 (1st Cir.1985).  Here, appellant's argument centers around the issue of contract formation and questions the district court's findings anent mutuality of obligation.  These questions are appropriately classified as questions of fact, subject to clear-error review.  Within this paradigm, a finding concerning a party's intent to contract is a finding of fact.  See Gel Systems, Inc. v. Hyundai Eng'g &amp; Constr.  Co., 902 F.2d 1024, 1027 (1st Cir.1990);  Reliance Steel, 880 F.2d at 576.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, we expressly reject appellant's asseveration that the issue of mutuality demands de novo review simply because it involves a mixed question of law and fact.  While such an issue does present a \"mixed\" question, mixed questions, to the extent that they are fact-dominated, are subject to clear-error review, not de novo review.  See In re Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1328 (1st Cir.1993);  Roland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm., 910 F.2d 983, 990 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 912, 111 S.Ct. 1122, 113 L.Ed.2d 230 (1991).  Therefore, unless appellant can show that the district court incorrectly applied a legal rule or standard--and, here, no such mistake of law looms--the court's findings in regard to mutuality must be upheld so long as they are not clearly erroneous.  See Roland M., 910 F.2d at 990;  Thrifty Rent-A-Car Sys., Inc. v. Thrift Cars, Inc., 831 F.2d 1177, 1181-82 (1st Cir.1987);  RCI Northeast Servs.  Div. v. Boston Edison Co., 822 F.2d 199, 202 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Mutuality of Obligation.   The law requires mutuality of obligation as a prerequisite to a binding bilateral contract.  See B &amp; D Appraisals v. Gaudette Mach. Movers, Inc., 733 F.Supp. 505, 507 (D.R.I.1990);  Law v. Law Trucking Co., 488 A.2d 1225, 1228 (R.I.1985);  see generally 1 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts Sec. 1:17, at 44 (4th ed. 1990).  This mutuality can be evidenced by an exchange of promises.  See B &amp; D Appraisals, 733 F.Supp. at 508;  Judd Realty, Inc. v. Tedesco, 400 A.2d 952, 956 (R.I.1979);  see generally Murray on Contracts, supra, Sec. 65, at 269 n. 48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that this benchmark has been achieved.  It seems to be saying that the documents submitted to it by ELC in 1990 embodied an offer, duly accepted by a return promise at the time, subject, however, to a contingency (Old Stone's consent to releasing its security interest);  and that removal of the contingency took place on or about March 1, 1991, when appellant informed ELC of Old Stone's acquiescence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  But this scenario overlooks--or, at least, impermissibly discounts--the district court's factfinding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To show mutuality of obligation, both parties must have been legally bound through the making of reciprocal promises.  Here, the court thought that both ELC and Cretco intended any agreement to be tentative, ergo, nonbinding, until other things happened.  As to ELC, the court found that it intended agreement to await approval by one of its funding sources--an approval that never materialized.  This finding is amply supported.  After all, ELC never signed the documents it proffered to Cretco in 1990.  The next spring, ELC declined to sign the new set of lease documents.  At that time, ELC asked for, and Cretco supplied, additional financial information for the sole purpose of attempting to convince BayBank, an ELC funding source, to underwrite the transaction.  The record is barren of evidence that ELC received a funding commitment at any time.  The record is similarly barren of evidence that ELC did major deals without outside funding.  These facts strongly support the district court's finding that ELC did not intend to bind itself through the submission of preliminary transactional paperwork in 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Cretco, the court concluded that it, too, lacked the requisite intent to be bound.  From its standpoint, entering into a binding contract had to await two developments:  the extraction of a piece of paper from Old Stone and, in Judge Torres's words, the obtaining of \"satisfactory supplementary financing.\"   We believe that the court's subsidiary findings on these points are sustainable;  indeed, it was for these very reasons that Cretco refused to execute the documents tendered to it in 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to undermine the court's determination that it was not bound, appellant argues that its acceptance of the November offer required it to do its utmost to gain the Old Stone release.  This argument will not wash.  For one thing, it glosses over the parallel, equally lethal finding that appellant viewed any relationship with ELC as subject to the obtaining of supplementary financing (in amounts, and on terms, satisfactory to appellant).  For another thing, both parties to a bilateral contract must have made more than illusory promises for the agreement to be binding.  See John D. Calamari &amp; Joseph M. Perillo, Contracts Sec. 4-17, at 160 (2d ed. 1977).  It is settled law that, when the promised act is conditional on the occurrence of a future event within the control of the promisor, the promise is illusory.  See Vickers Antone v. Vickers, 610 A.2d 120, 123 (R.I.1992);  see also Calamari &amp; Perillo, Contracts Sec. 4-17, at 160.  We see nothing in the 1990 \"Equipment Lease Agreement\" that would indicate that appellant bound itself to have Old Stone release its security interest in the fleet or to make any particular efforts in this regard.  Moreover, even if such an obligation can somehow be implied out of thin air--and we do not think it can be--the documents certainly impose no time limit on when appellant would have to bring about this event, or what concessions it would have to endure.  Therefore, the procuring of Old Stone's release, like the obtaining of supplementary financing, was in appellant's unbridled discretion.  At the most, then, appellant gave ELC a mirage of a promise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that appellant's actions belie its current contention that the parties were bound in 1990 and thereafter.  During the critical period, appellant tried valiantly to forge arrangements with other lending institutions--arrangements that would have left ELC out in the cold.  Richard Crellin testified that, as late as February of 1991, he approached Fleet Bank to see if it would \"offer a more attractive deal.\"   He admitted on cross-examination that he would have looked favorably upon Fleet replacing both ELC and Old Stone in Cretco's plans had an offer been forthcoming on comely terms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Thus, despite the fact that appellant claims it was only scouting out supplemental financing, the evidence is adequate to warrant the district court's contrary finding that appellant continued to seek other financing options as a surrogate for, rather than as a supplement to, an alliance with ELC.  When, as in this case, the proof supports more than one plausible view of the relevant events, and the district court chooses one such view over another, the court's choice cannot be clearly erroneous.  See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985);  Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This finding is significant.  Although appellant may have exercised good business sense when it shopped the financial markets for better terms in the winter of 1990-91, it cannot plausibly claim that ELC was bound although it had no corresponding obligation.  Given, especially, three things--the discretionary nature of appellant's \"obligation\" to procure the Old Stone release and the needed supplementary financing, its concession that, in and after November of 1990, it believed that \"if it had wanted to, it could have gone elsewhere\" for financing,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and the evidence that it acted on this stated belief--we do not perceive clear error in the district court's finding that no obligation inured on Cretco's part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the trial court found that neither ELC nor Cretco undertook a binding obligation to the other.  Either half of this disjunctive finding is sufficient to warrant judgment for the defendant on the breach of contract count.  Both halves are sustainable.  Hence, the court's ultimate conclusion--that no enforceable contract existed because no mutuality of obligation existed--is unimpugnable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Unilateral Offer.   Before leaving the breach of contract claim, we close one last door.  Were we to characterize the initial document submission as a unilateral offer--a characterization that appellant, for the most part, has assiduously resisted--appellant's lot would not be improved.  As the district court observed, the documents that ELC delivered in November 1990 did not specify a time within which appellant had to accept any offer they might have contained.  It, therefore, would have had a reasonable time within which to do so, for an offer that does not contain a deadline for acceptance will lapse after a reasonable time if it is not accepted.  See Mathewson Corp. v. Allied Marine Indus., Inc., 827 F.2d 850, 853 (1st Cir.1987) (\"It is hornbook law that an offeree's power of acceptance vanishes at the time specified in the offer, and if no deadline is prescribed, 'at the end of a reasonable time.' \")  (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts Sec. 41(1) (1979));  see also Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Ry. v. Columbus Rolling Mill, 119 U.S. 149, 151, 7 S.Ct. 168, 169, 30 L.Ed. 376 (1886);  Thermo Electron Corp. v. Schiavone Constr.  Co., 958 F.2d 1158, 1164 (1st Cir.1992).  What amount of time is reasonable within the context of a particular case is \"a classic example of a decision that the law leaves to a district court, not to this court, to decide.\"  Thermo Electron, 958 F.2d at 1166;  see also Murray on Contracts, supra, Sec. 41C, at 102.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant concedes that, generally, four months is an unreasonably long time for a financing offer to remain open.  We agree with the district court that, in a period of rapidly fluctuating interest rates and with no extenuating circumstances, this case falls comfortably within the sweep of that generality.  Because it would have been thoroughly unreasonable for appellant to believe that a sale/leaseback proposal made in November and not then accepted would linger on the table until the following March, a \"unilateral offer\" theory leads down a blind alley.  And, moreover, we discern no clear error in the trial court's rejection of appellant's claim that the \"offer\" was periodically refreshed by what appellant--but not the court--viewed as continuing reassurances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE IMPLIED COVENANT CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant next claims that ELC breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it refused to proceed with the alleged contract, and, adding insult to injury, gave apocryphal reasons for its refusal to perform.  When, as now, a duty of good faith and fair dealing is alleged to arise from a contractual relationship, a claim for breach of that duty sounds in contract rather than in tort.  See Bertrand v. Quincy Market Cold Storage &amp; Warehouse Co., 728 F.2d 568, 571 (1st Cir.1984).  This, in turn, dictates choice of law:  the same substantive law that governs the contract claim also governs the implied covenant claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, then, Rhode Island law controls.  Rhode Island recognizes that virtually every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing between the parties.  See A.A.A. Pool Serv. &amp; Supply, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 121 R.I. 96, 395 A.2d 724, 725 (1978);  Ide Farm &amp; Stable, Inc. v. Cardi, 110 R.I. 735, 297 A.2d 643, 645 (1972);  see also Fleet Nat'l Bank v. Liuzzo, 766 F.Supp. 61, 67 (D.R.I.1991);  Landry v. Farmer, 564 F.Supp. 598, 611 (D.R.I.1983).  Because the implied covenant exists \"so that the contractual objectives may be achieved,\" Ide Farm, 297 A.2d at 645, it necessarily follows that where there is no contract, there is no duty.  In such circumstances, there is nothing from which the covenant can be implied.  Or, phrased differently, the law does not require persons to act in particular ways in order to achieve illusory contractual objectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this basis, the covenant is left without visible means of support, and no claim for a breach of it will lie.  See Jordan-Milton Mach., Inc. v. F/V Teresa Marie, II, 978 F.2d 32, 36 (1st Cir.1992);  cf. Gleason v. Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., 589 F.Supp. 1474, 1477 (D.R.I.1984) (applying same principle in insurance context).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come, finally, to appellant's unfair trade practices claim.  This claim invokes a Massachusetts statute that provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ny person who engages in the conduct of any trade or commerce and who suffers any loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person who engages in any trade or commerce of an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice ... may, as hereinafter provided, bring an action ... for damages....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A, Sec. 11 (1984).  The district court, without making an explicit choice-of-law determination, dismissed the claim on the ground that the interdicted conduct did not occur in trade or commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's chapter 93A claim is really two separate but related claims.  We deal with them seriatim.   The first initiative fails to state a cause of action even if chapter 93A applies, and we dispose of it on that basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  The second initiative is a horse of a different hue;  if chapter 93A applies, it arguably states a claim.  Consequently, we treat the choice-of-law question that necessarily precedes substantive consideration of this initiative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>A. The First Half of the Chapter 93A Claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's initial charge--that ELC, by blaming the collapse of the deal on Cretco's financial plight rather than on its own empty coffers, misrepresented its reason for refusing to proceed with the sale and leaseback--need not detain us.  Although Judge Torres found that ELC had not informed appellant that its participation in the deal would hinge upon the availability of funding, there is no credible evidence that ELC ever made express representations to the contrary.  Thus, even if we assume the truth of the charge, no reasonable factfinder could conclude that ELC's conduct in this respect descended to the level of rascality required for a successful chapter 93A suit.  See, e.g., Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 515-16 (1st Cir.1988) (explaining that, \"[i]n Massachusetts, the litmus test for transgression of chapter 93A involves behavior which falls within 'the penumbra of some ... established concept of unfairness' \") (quoting Massachusetts cases);  Levings v. Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc., 8 Mass.App.Ct. 498, 396 N.E.2d 149, 153 (1979) (explaining that \"objectionable conduct must attain a level of rascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce\" in order to support a chapter 93A action);  see also Maruho Co. v. Miles, Inc., 13 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.1993);  Quaker State Oil Refining Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co., 884 F.2d 1510, 1513 (1st Cir.1989);  Whitinsville Plaza, Inc. v. Kotseas, 378 Mass. 85, 390 N.E.2d 243, 251 (1979);  Rex Lumber Co. v. Acton Block Co., 29 Mass.App.Ct. 510, 562 N.E.2d 845, 850 (1990).  Whether or not full disclosure during arm's-length business negotiations is more likely the exception than the rule, a failure fully to disclose, standing alone, while sometimes actionable in tort, ordinarily will not transgress chapter 93A.  So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>B. The Second Half of the Chapter 93A Claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second basis for the appellant's chapter 93A claim arguably consists of sterner stuff.  During pretrial discovery, ELC produced a handwritten credit decision memorandum (CDM) dated November 2, 1990.  Attached to the CDM was a note purportedly written to Mark Patterson, advising him that the handwritten memo superseded a typed CDM of the same vintage.  The difference between the two memoranda is of import.  The typed CDM stated that the sale and leaseback had been approved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  The handwritten version, however, conditioned the approval on a thoroughgoing review of appellant's financial status and a favorable reaction by an ELC funding source.  By the time the case reached trial, appellant had integrated ELC's gamesmanship during discovery with its other purported peccadilloes, and charged that the handwritten CDM was a fake, manufactured after the fact in order to lay the groundwork for ELC's defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume, arguendo, that the described conduct might infract chapter 93A, see generally Quaker State, 884 F.2d at 1513-14 (discussing when tactics in, and related to, ongoing litigation may prove actionable under chapter 93A), we nevertheless must pause at the choice-of-law threshold.  Recognizing that a defendant in a contract case governed by one state's law nonetheless may be subject to the provisions of another state's unfair trade practices statute, see, e.g., Computer Sys. Eng'g, Inc. v. Qantel Corp., 740 F.2d 59, 64 nn. 6, 7 (1st Cir.1984), that result will obtain only if the forum state's choice-of-law rules so dictate, see id. at 70.   Considering this possibility brings into play the principle of depecage, which we have described as \"the framework under which different issues in a single case ... may be decided according to the substantive law of different states.\"  Putnam Resources, 958 F.2d at 465.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For choice-of-law purposes, we treat appellant's chapter 93A initiative as a species of tort claim.  At least one federal court has made the across-the-board assessment that chapter 93A claims \"should be treated uniformly, rather than on a case-by-case basis, in the same way as tort claims.\"  Computer Sys. Eng'g, Inc. v. Qantel Corp., 571 F.Supp. 1365, 1371 (D.Mass.1983), aff'd, 740 F.2d 59 (1st Cir.1984).  We need not go so far.  We hold that, at minimum, when a chapter 93A claim and the requested remedy are highly analogous to a tort claim and remedy, the chapter 93A claim should be considered as a tort for choice-of-law purposes.  See id. at 1370-71;  see also Michael C. Gilleran, The Law of Chapter 93A Sec. 12:8, at 413 (1989);  cf. Northeast Data Sys., Inc. v. McDonnell Douglas Computer Sys. Co., 986 F.2d 607, 609 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that a chapter 93A claim may trigger a contractual conflicts analysis where it is essentially an \"embroidered\" contract claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In applying these principles, we focus only on the arguably actionable conduct, i.e., appellant's second chapter 93A initiative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  In that initiative, appellant claimed that ELC manufactured evidence in an attempt to justify its nonperformance.  This charge resembles the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation.  Similarly, appellant asked for a tort-like remedy (multiple damages and attorneys' fees).  Thus, we consider this species of chapter 93A claim as falling under the tort rubric for purposes of our choice-of-law assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In tort cases, Rhode Island uses a multipart analysis to determine which of two states has the more significant interest in the resolution of the issue presented in the case.  See Pardey v. Boulevard Billiard Club, Inc., 518 A.2d 1349, 1351 (R.I.1986);  accord Brown v. Church of the Holy Name of Jesus, 105 R.I. 322, 252 A.2d 176, 178 (1969);  Woodward v. Stewart, 104 R.I. 290, 243 A.2d 917, 923, cert. dism'd, 393 U.S. 957, 89 S.Ct. 387, 21 L.Ed.2d 371 (1968);  see also Putnam Resources, 958 F.2d at 464;  Fashion House, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1092 (1st Cir.1989);  Montaup Elec. Co. v. Ohio Brass Corp., 561 F.Supp. 740, 744-45 (D.R.I.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">General choice-of-law principles that should guide a court in making such a determination include (1) predictability of results;  (2) maintenance of interstate order;  (3) simplification of the judicial task;  (4) advancement of the forum's governmental interests;  and (5) application of the better rule of law.  See Putnam Resources, 958 F.2d at 464-65;  Brown, 252 A.2d at 178;  Woodward, 243 A.2d at 923;  see also Restatement Sec. 6.  In considering these general principles, tort conflict-of-law analysis weighs more heavily the needs of the interstate system, the policies of the interested states as well as the forum, and the ease of determination and application of the law.  See Restatement Sec. 145, cmt. b.  In the tort context, these overarching tenets may take into account a number of other factors, including (1) the place of injury;  (2) the place where the conduct which caused the injury occurred;  (3) the place of incorporation and place of business of each party;  and (4) the locus, or center of gravity, of the parties' relationship.  See Putnam Resources, 958 F.2d at 464;  Fashion House, 892 F.2d at 1092;  Brown, 252 A.2d at 179;  see also Restatement Sec. 145(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An application of these factors reveals that Rhode Island has a more significant interest than Massachusetts in the resolution of this claim.  Appellant initiated negotiations with ELC in Rhode Island--and interstate policy does not dictate prosecution under the Massachusetts statute of every deceptive trade allegation brought against a company headquartered in Massachusetts but doing business in another state.  Rhode Island has a substantial interest in protecting its resident companies from deceptive representations or unfair trade practices, especially those that may occur within its borders.  As it is the forum state, an application of Rhode Island's tort law would be more easily accomplished than an application of Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, too, in addition to the Rhode Island locus of the claimed injury, the allegedly tortious conduct also possesses substantial links to Rhode Island.  Appellant's claim arose when Douglas Crellin visited Mark Patterson at his Rhode Island home and saw the typed version of the CDM.  The coverup itself--if one took place--must have been crafted in the course of pretrial discovery in a Rhode Island forum.  Even if we assume that the handwritten version of the CDM was created in Massachusetts--and there is no proof of that fact--such a contact, standing alone, would not be enough to overcome Rhode Island's interest in compensating a Rhode Island company whose financial well-being was compromised through deceptive acts of a company doing business within Rhode Island.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that to the extent appellant presents a potentially viable unfair trade practices claim, the claim is governed by the substantive law of Rhode Island.  Because that is so, appellant's claim under chapter 93A is not actionable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  See, e.g., Eastland Bank v. Massbank for Savings, 767 F.Supp. 29, 35 (D.R.I.), aff'd mem., 953 F.2d 633 (1st Cir.1991);  cf. Qantel, 740 F.2d at 70.   Accordingly, we affirm the district court's dismissal of this claim on different, but equally dispositive, grounds, see generally Polyplastics, Inc. v. Transconex, Inc., 827 F.2d 859, 860-61 (1st Cir.1987) (explaining that an appellate court, in affirming a judgment, is not limited to the trial court's rationale, but can affirm on any independent ground made manifest in the record), without reaching the question of whether the alleged coverup can be said to have been aimed at influencing Cretco \"in the conduct of any [ongoing] trade or commerce.\"   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A, Sec. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.

The omitted material would have revealed both a lower net worth and a decreased likelihood of future profitability.  At trial, the district judge found that this omission came about through inadvertence, not through intentional misrepresentation.  Nevertheless, the financial statements, as presented, were both misleading and incomplete</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Unless and until a sale and leaseback transpired, these two documents were meaningless;  neither of them had any independent force</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> At various times, Cretco has argued either that a bilateral contract underpinned the breach of contract count--ELC made a firm offer in November of 1990 and Cretco accepted the offer at that time, subject to a condition (the procuring of Old Stone's consent) that was fulfilled the following March--or, alternately, that ELC extended a unilateral offer, subject to Cretco's later acceptance.  Whichever way the scenario is viewed, the upshot of the litigation remains unaffected</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In this case the district court, while leaving spoor for the cognoscenti, made no explicit choice of law.  We, therefore, write on a pristine page</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Courts and commentators use a variety of compound adjectives, such as \"interest-weighing\" and \"locus-of-interests,\" to describe the more modern approach.  For ease in reference, we employ the term \"interest-weighing.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Choice of law in a contract case requires a court to make a threshold determination as to the efficacy of any choice-of-law provision that the parties may have included in the contract documents.  Here, the draft lease submitted by ELC to Cretco in November 1990 contained a provision for construction and enforcement according to Massachusetts law.  We disregard this provision for three reasons.  First, Cretco never signed the document in question, and the provision did not reappear in later documents.  Second, neither party mentioned the provision in appellate briefs nor argued that it should be given effect.  Third, while section 187 of the Restatement indicates that an effective choice-of-law provision in a contract document generally should be respected, that rule \"is applicable only in situations where it is established to the satisfaction of the forum that the parties have chosen the state [to be the source] of the applicable law.\"   Restatement Sec. 187, cmt. a.  This is not such a case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> After the initial discussions, negotiations continued in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> From time to time, appellant shifts gears.  On those occasions, it seems to be saying that ELC's offer was unilateral and remained open until March 1, 1991, when appellant accepted the arrangement.  We cover this possibility in Part II(B)(3), infra</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Mark Patterson testified that in early 1991 he believed Cretco was \"shopping around\" for better financing terms and biding its time in anticipation of a lower prime rate.  It is obvious from this and other evidence that ELC knew of Cretco's ongoing forays into the financial markets</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Appellant's counsel made the quoted statement to the district court in final argument.  Appellant, therefore, cannot disclaim the statement on appeal.  See, e.g., United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir.1991) (explaining that a party who, in hindsight, finds dissatisfaction with the arguments he advanced in the district court \"cannot switch horses mid-stream in hopes of locating a swifter steed\");  see also Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. General Cinema Corp., 834 F.2d 208, 214 (1st Cir.1987) (stating that when a litigant \"asserts inconsistent statements of fact\" at different junctures in litigation, the doctrine of \"judicial estoppel\" prevents unfair advantage)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Even if Massachusetts law supplies the rule of decision, the result remains the same.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellant Crellin Technologies, Inc.  (Cretco), a Rhode Island corporation, sells, rents, services, and provides parts for lift trucks and other materials handling equipment.  In 1990, Crellin suffered from a serious cash flow malady.  In order to stanch the financial hemorrhaging caused by steep monthly payments to institutional lenders, Richard Crellin, Cretco's chief executive officer and part owner, began exploring various options.  Crellin knew that, on occasion, defendant-appellee Equipmentlease Corporation (ELC), a Massachusetts firm, had provided financing for certain of Cretco's customers.  Consequently, Crellin sought to interest an ELC representative, Mark Patterson, in structuring a sale and leaseback.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Cretco proposed to sell its fleet of lift trucks to ELC and then lease back the fleet, keeping the equipment available for use in the ordinary course of Cretco's business.  Cretco planned to apply some or all of the sale proceeds to pay down its institutional debt, thereby easing the cash flow crunch and enhancing the prospect that its principal lender, Old Stone Bank (Old Stone), would provide long-term financing on less onerous terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing what it thought were Cretco's complete financial statements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> ELC agreed that a sale/leaseback transaction might prove feasible.  In November of 1990, ELC prepared the paperwork that it needed to start a formal commitment process.  But ELC's overtures went unrequited, for Old Stone had not agreed to release its security interest in the fleet.  Thus, Cretco refused to sign ELC's documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the period from November 1990 to February 1991, Cretco and ELC maintained an ongoing dialogue.  Although Cretco now portrays these communications as reassurances that ELC was committed to a sale and leaseback, the trial court supportably found them to be mere expressions of a continuing mutual interest directed toward finding agreeable terms on which to do a deal of some undetermined magnitude.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February of 1991, Cretco made its peace with Old Stone and received the long-awaited agreement for release of the bank's security interest.  Cretco relayed the good news to ELC on or about March 1, and requested a meeting.  On March 11, 1991, Richard Crellin travelled to ELC's Worcester (Massachusetts) office and signed papers prepared by ELC.  At the same time, ELC executed subordination and option agreements prepared by Cretco.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties dispute the legal significance of these events.  In one corner, Cretco contends that, in the March 1 call, Richard Crellin gave the green light to consummating the sale/leaseback contract negotiated between the parties in November 1990--and that he reinforced this clearance by executing the documents proffered to him on March 11.  In the opposing corner, ELC contends that neither the March 1 telephone conversation nor the March 11 signing carried any legal weight;  the call was purely informational and the documents were designed merely to restart the formal commitment process for a new, albeit resurrected, sale and leaseback.  ELC points out that the proffered papers were in different dollar amounts and on different terms than the documents prepared in late 1990, and that, at any rate, it never signed them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is at sixes and sevens regarding the reasons why ELC applied the brakes.  Richard Crellin testified that ELC led him to believe that the documents would be signed soon after March 11, and Cretco viewed ELC's failure to do so as a breach of contract.  ELC's witnesses told a much different story.  They said ELC informed Richard Crellin that, in pursuance of its customary practice, the document package had to be submitted to ELC's funding source, BayBank, for approval before ELC would enter a firm agreement.  According to these witnesses, a final set of contract documents ultimately would have been generated if, having been assured that funds were available, management made a binding decision to do the deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that ELC approached BayBank to supply the needed funds, and that BayBank turned thumbs down.  Thereafter, ELC requested additional information from Cretco and submitted a revised request.  BayBank again refused to open the purse strings, reportedly due to Cretco's anemic financial status.  It was for this reason, then, that ELC decided not to go forward with a sale and leaseback.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make a tedious tale tolerably terse, Cretco eventually invited ELC to honor what it perceived as a binding contract.  ELC declined the invitation, saying that no contract ever existed.  Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332 (1988), Cretco sued ELC in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.  It charged, inter alia, that ELC ignored a binding obligation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> ] dishonored the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that formed part of the contractual relationship, and violated a Massachusetts unfair trade practices statute by deceptive dealing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a bench trial, the district judge found that appellant had not proven any of its three claims.  On the breach of contract count, the judge determined that there had been no mutuality of obligation and, therefore, no binding contract.  In this vein, he noted, inter alia, that Cretco had not purported to make a timely acceptance of ELC's proposal;  that, throughout the negotiations, Cretco endeavored to keep any agreement contingent upon its ability to secure new (and more manageable) bank financing;  that Cretco could not have sold the fleet without first obtaining Old Stone's consent to the release of its security interest--a consent that did not materialize in 1990;  that, before litigation became an option of choice, Cretco had not viewed the November 1990 documents as binding;  and that Cretco had shopped around in the ensuing months for a better interest rate.  The judge found that ELC, too, had kept its powder dry, for it intended all along--though it had not informed Cretco about this contingency in the fall of 1990--to condition any sale and leaseback upon approval by its own funding source.  Hence, since both parties believed the transaction to be contingent upon other occurrences, controllable by them--Cretco, for example, did not have to accede to Old Stone's terms, and, similarly, ELC did not have to accede to the terms demanded by its funding source--mutuality of obligation did not exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a commendable effort to cover the waterfront, the judge identified an alternative ground for dismissing the contract claim.  Even if one assumed, for argument's sake, that a contract had been formed and that ELC had broken it, Cretco's first count sought only compensatory damages, not specific performance, and Cretco had not proven that it suffered or sustained any recoverable damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cretco's other two counts fared no better.  In regard to good faith and fair dealing, the judge reasoned that, because no enforceable contract existed, there could be no breach of an implied covenant arising out of that non-contract.  As to chapter 93A, the judge found that the deceptive practices of which Cretco complained, if they occurred at all, did not occur in the course of trade or commerce, and, therefore, did not transgress the cited statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cretco appeals.

The Local Landscape.   Rhode Island law anent contract conflict-of-law principles is sparse and leaves the proper choice-of-law test for contract cases shrouded in uncertainty.  In 1969, Rhode Island's highest court made use of the lex loci contractus doctrine in such a context.  See Union Sav. Bank v. DeMarco, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2165549\"><a href=\"/opinion/2165549/union-savings-bank-v-demarco/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 83 (1969) (holding a loan granted in Massachusetts to be a Massachusetts contract governed by Massachusetts law).  Three years later the court, when asked to endorse the neoteric interest-weighing approach to contract conflict issues as enunciated in the Restatement (Second) of the Conflict of Laws Sec. 188 (1971) (hereinafter \"Restatement\"), expressly declined to choose between the new and the old choice-of-law rules.  See A.C. Beals Co. v. Rhode Island Hosp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2384253\"><a href=\"/opinion/2384253/ac-beals-company-v-rhode-island-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span>, 871 n. 5 (1972).  Two subsequent Rhode Island cases that touch upon the question transmit mixed signals.  In Matarese v. Calise, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2388585\"><a href=\"/opinion/2388585/matarese-v-calise/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span> (1973), a case calling for a choice between local law and the law of a foreign sovereign, the court cited with approval a statement favoring resort to the law of the place of contracting.  See id. 305 A.2d at 118 n. 4 (dictum;  citing Annotation, 72 A.L.R. 250 (1931)).  Two decades later, the court indicated a preference for an interest-weighing analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Gordon v.

Discussion.   We need not attempt to resolve this impasse by venturing an informed prophecy as to which test will emerge triumphant in the Rhode Island courts.  Here, providentially, Rhode Island law must prevail under either choice-of-law format.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of the older \"place of contracting\" test, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has held that the place of contracting is the place in which the last act that forms the contract is performed.  See Tim Hennigan Co. v. Anthony A. Nunes, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2058869\"><a href=\"/opinion/2058869/tim-hennigan-co-v-anthony-a-nunes-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1355</span></a></span>, 1357 (R.I.1981);  A.C. Beals, 292 A.2d at 870-71.   Counsel for Cretco maintained at oral argument in this court that the contract solidified on or about March 1, 1991, when Richard Crellin telephoned ELC to relay the news of Old Stone's agreement to release its security interest.  This telephone call originated in Rhode Island.  Thus, even though ELC received the call in Massachusetts, the final act of contract formation took place in Rhode Island.  The rule is that, when a contract is cinched in the course of an interstate telephone call, the contract will be deemed to have been made in the state where the decisive words were spoken.  See, e.g., Perry v. Mount Hope Iron Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></span>, 633 (1886) (holding that an offer accepted by telegraph will be deemed accepted where telegram is sent, not where it is received);  see also John E. Murray, Jr., Murray on Contracts Sec. 47G, at 152 (3d ed. 1990) (explaining proper rule for acceptance of offer by telephone;  where parties are at a distance, \"acceptance will have occurred where and when the acceptance was spoken or sent\").  Hence, under the place of contracting rule, Rhode Island law applies to the breach of contract count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The functional interest-weighing approach to conflict analysis for contract issues yields the same result.  This approach requires a court to take cognizance of overall policy goals even as it evaluates the significance of the parties' contacts with various jurisdictions and their conduct as a contract is negotiated, consummated, and performed.  See Restatement Secs. 6, 188.  On the policy side, the Restatement suggests that a court inquiring into choice of law consider (1) the needs of the interstate system;  (2) relevant policies of the forum;  (3) policies of other affected states and their interest in the outcome of the litigation;  (4) protection of the parties' justified expectations;  (5) uniformity and predictability of results;  and (6) ease in determining and applying different bodies of law, see id. Sec. 6.  This panoply of policy considerations is to be assessed against a more traditional, more concrete backdrop comprised of (1) the place of contracting;  (2) the situs of negotiations;  (3) the place of performance;  (4) the location, if any, of the contract's subject matter;  and (5) the business locations and states of incorporation of corporate parties, see id. Sec. 188.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under an interest-weighing analysis, appellant's contract claim is governed by Rhode Island law.  Cretco is a Rhode Island corporation.  ELC, albeit headquartered in Massachusetts, maintains an office in Providence, Rhode Island.  Cretco initiated and continued negotiations with ELC's representative, Mark Patterson, in Providence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Although performance of the sought-after contract would have overspread a wide geographic area, the cash infusion generated by the sale and leaseback was to have taken place in Rhode Island and was to have been used in large part to retire debt owed to a Rhode Island lender.  The fleet would continue to be based in Rhode Island and to be monitored by Cretco's Rhode Island headquarters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, an application of Rhode Island law furthers the general principles and policy goals limned in the Restatement.  Rhode Island is the forum state.  It has a legitimate stake in the outcome of the suit:  Cretco is domiciled in Rhode Island and its economic viability is at risk.  This interest clearly outweighs Massachusetts' interest in the suit (which is limited to the impact of one soured relationship between an in-state defendant and one of its many out-of-state clients).  The combination of appellant's home base, ELC's presence in Rhode Island, and the incidence of negotiations involving a Rhode Island representative of ELC should have led thoughtful parties to expect that Rhode Island law would govern their dealings.  Last, the law of the forum, other things being equal, is ordinarily to be preferred;  Rhode Island's is the most natural, and, therefore, the easiest law for the district court to apply.  We think it follows that, under an interest-weighing analysis, the substantive law of Rhode Island controls appellant's contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, regardless whether lex loci contractus or an interest-weighing approach prevails, a Rhode Island court would apply Rhode Island substantive law to appellant's contract claim.  Thus, the federal district court, sitting in Rhode Island, was obliged to do the same.  In turn, this court must also utilize Rhode Island law--and we must do so without deference to the district court's construction of that law.  See Salve Regina Coll. v.

To be sure, appellant strives to blunt the force of this rule by pointing out that mistakes of state law are subject to plenary review, see Salve Regina Coll., 499 U.S. at 230, 111 S.Ct. at 1221, and then dressing quintessentially factual matters in the garb of \"legal error.\"   But factual issues are demonstrably different than legal issues, and no amount of slick costumery can transform the one into the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have consistently held that, so long as the evidence does not point unerringly in a single direction but is capable of supporting conflicting inferences, the question of whether a contract has been formed between two parties is a question of fact to be determined by the factfinder.

Here, appellant's argument centers around the issue of contract formation and questions the district court's findings anent mutuality of obligation.  These questions are appropriately classified as questions of fact, subject to clear-error review.  Within this paradigm, a finding concerning a party's intent to contract is a finding of fact.  See Gel Systems, Inc. v. Hyundai Eng'g &amp; Constr.  Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541062\"><a href=\"/opinion/541062/gel-systems-inc-v-hyundai-engineering-construction-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1024</span></a></span>, 1027 (1st Cir.1990);  Reliance Steel, 880 F.2d at 576.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, we expressly reject appellant's asseveration that the issue of mutuality demands de novo review simply because it involves a mixed question of law and fact.  While such an issue does present a \"mixed\" question, mixed questions, to the extent that they are fact-dominated, are subject to clear-error review, not de novo review.

Therefore, unless appellant can show that the district court incorrectly applied a legal rule or standard--and, here, no such mistake of law looms--the court's findings in regard to mutuality must be upheld so long as they are not clearly erroneous.

Mutuality of Obligation.   The law requires mutuality of obligation as a prerequisite to a binding bilateral contract.  See B &amp; D Appraisals v. Gaudette Mach. Movers, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1517243\"><a href=\"/opinion/1517243/b-d-appraisals-v-gaudette-machinery-movers/\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Lord, Williston on Contracts Sec. 1:17, at 44 (4th ed. 1990).  This mutuality can be evidenced by an exchange of promises.  See B &amp; D Appraisals, 733 F.Supp. at 508;  Judd Realty, Inc. v. Tedesco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1462818\"><a href=\"/opinion/1462818/judd-realty-inc-v-tedesco/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span>, 956 (R.I.1979);  see generally Murray on Contracts, supra, Sec. 65, at 269 n. 48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that this benchmark has been achieved.  It seems to be saying that the documents submitted to it by ELC in 1990 embodied an offer, duly accepted by a return promise at the time, subject, however, to a contingency (Old Stone's consent to releasing its security interest);  and that removal of the contingency took place on or about March 1, 1991, when appellant informed ELC of Old Stone's acquiescence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  But this scenario overlooks--or, at least, impermissibly discounts--the district court's factfinding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To show mutuality of obligation, both parties must have been legally bound through the making of reciprocal promises.  Here, the court thought that both ELC and Cretco intended any agreement to be tentative, ergo, nonbinding, until other things happened.  As to ELC, the court found that it intended agreement to await approval by one of its funding sources--an approval that never materialized.  This finding is amply supported.  After all, ELC never signed the documents it proffered to Cretco in 1990.  The next spring, ELC declined to sign the new set of lease documents.  At that time, ELC asked for, and Cretco supplied, additional financial information for the sole purpose of attempting to convince BayBank, an ELC funding source, to underwrite the transaction.  The record is barren of evidence that ELC received a funding commitment at any time.  The record is similarly barren of evidence that ELC did major deals without outside funding.  These facts strongly support the district court's finding that ELC did not intend to bind itself through the submission of preliminary transactional paperwork in 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Cretco, the court concluded that it, too, lacked the requisite intent to be bound.  From its standpoint, entering into a binding contract had to await two developments:  the extraction of a piece of paper from Old Stone and, in Judge Torres's words, the obtaining of \"satisfactory supplementary financing.\"   We believe that the court's subsidiary findings on these points are sustainable;  indeed, it was for these very reasons that Cretco refused to execute the documents tendered to it in 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to undermine the court's determination that it was not bound, appellant argues that its acceptance of the November offer required it to do its utmost to gain the Old Stone release.  This argument will not wash.  For one thing, it glosses over the parallel, equally lethal finding that appellant viewed any relationship with ELC as subject to the obtaining of supplementary financing (in amounts, and on terms, satisfactory to appellant).  For another thing, both parties to a bilateral contract must have made more than illusory promises for the agreement to be binding.  See John D. Calamari &amp; Joseph M. Perillo, Contracts Sec. 4-17, at 160 (2d ed. 1977).  It is settled law that, when the promised act is conditional on the occurrence of a future event within the control of the promisor, the promise is illusory.  See Vickers Antone v. Vickers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1909963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1909963/vickers-antone-v-vickers/\"><span class=\"volume\">610</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 123 (R.I.1992);  see also Calamari &amp; Perillo, Contracts Sec. 4-17, at 160.  We see nothing in the 1990 \"Equipment Lease Agreement\" that would indicate that appellant bound itself to have Old Stone release its security interest in the fleet or to make any particular efforts in this regard.  Moreover, even if such an obligation can somehow be implied out of thin air--and we do not think it can be--the documents certainly impose no time limit on when appellant would have to bring about this event, or what concessions it would have to endure.  Therefore, the procuring of Old Stone's release, like the obtaining of supplementary financing, was in appellant's unbridled discretion.  At the most, then, appellant gave ELC a mirage of a promise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that appellant's actions belie its current contention that the parties were bound in 1990 and thereafter.  During the critical period, appellant tried valiantly to forge arrangements with other lending institutions--arrangements that would have left ELC out in the cold.  Richard Crellin testified that, as late as February of 1991, he approached Fleet Bank to see if it would \"offer a more attractive deal.\"   He admitted on cross-examination that he would have looked favorably upon Fleet replacing both ELC and Old Stone in Cretco's plans had an offer been forthcoming on comely terms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Thus, despite the fact that appellant claims it was only scouting out supplemental financing, the evidence is adequate to warrant the district court's contrary finding that appellant continued to seek other financing options as a surrogate for, rather than as a supplement to, an alliance with ELC.  When, as in this case, the proof supports more than one plausible view of the relevant events, and the district court chooses one such view over another, the court's choice cannot be clearly erroneous.  See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 574, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although appellant may have exercised good business sense when it shopped the financial markets for better terms in the winter of 1990-91, it cannot plausibly claim that ELC was bound although it had no corresponding obligation.  Given, especially, three things--the discretionary nature of appellant's \"obligation\" to procure the Old Stone release and the needed supplementary financing, its concession that, in and after November of 1990, it believed that \"if it had wanted to, it could have gone elsewhere\" for financing,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and the evidence that it acted on this stated belief--we do not perceive clear error in the district court's finding that no obligation inured on Cretco's part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the trial court found that neither ELC nor Cretco undertook a binding obligation to the other.  Either half of this disjunctive finding is sufficient to warrant judgment for the defendant on the breach of contract count.  Both halves are sustainable.  Hence, the court's ultimate conclusion--that no enforceable contract existed because no mutuality of obligation existed--is unimpugnable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Unilateral Offer.   Before leaving the breach of contract claim, we close one last door.  Were we to characterize the initial document submission as a unilateral offer--a characterization that appellant, for the most part, has assiduously resisted--appellant's lot would not be improved.  As the district court observed, the documents that ELC delivered in November 1990 did not specify a time within which appellant had to accept any offer they might have contained.  It, therefore, would have had a reasonable time within which to do so, for an offer that does not contain a deadline for acceptance will lapse after a reasonable time if it is not accepted.  See Mathewson Corp. v. Allied Marine Indus., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493607\"><a href=\"/opinion/493607/mathewson-corporation-v-allied-marine-industries-inc-brad-foote-gear/\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span>, 853 (1st Cir.1987) (\"It is hornbook law that an offeree's power of acceptance vanishes at the time specified in the offer, and if no deadline is prescribed, 'at the end of a reasonable time.' \")  (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts Sec. 41(1) (1979));  see also Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Ry. v.

What amount of time is reasonable within the context of a particular case is \"a classic example of a decision that the law leaves to a district court, not to this court, to decide.\"  Thermo Electron, 958 F.2d at 1166;  see also Murray on Contracts, supra, Sec. 41C, at 102.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant concedes that, generally, four months is an unreasonably long time for a financing offer to remain open.  We agree with the district court that, in a period of rapidly fluctuating interest rates and with no extenuating circumstances, this case falls comfortably within the sweep of that generality.  Because it would have been thoroughly unreasonable for appellant to believe that a sale/leaseback proposal made in November and not then accepted would linger on the table until the following March, a \"unilateral offer\" theory leads down a blind alley.  And, moreover, we discern no clear error in the trial court's rejection of appellant's claim that the \"offer\" was periodically refreshed by what appellant--but not the court--viewed as continuing reassurances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE IMPLIED COVENANT CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant next claims that ELC breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it refused to proceed with the alleged contract, and, adding insult to injury, gave apocryphal reasons for its refusal to perform.  When, as now, a duty of good faith and fair dealing is alleged to arise from a contractual relationship, a claim for breach of that duty sounds in contract rather than in tort.  See Bertrand v. Quincy Market Cold Storage &amp; Warehouse Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"431808\"><a href=\"/opinion/431808/richard-j-bertrand-jr-v-quincy-market-cold-storage-warehouse-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">728</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, 571 (1st Cir.1984).  This, in turn, dictates choice of law:  the same substantive law that governs the contract claim also governs the implied covenant claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, then, Rhode Island law controls.

Because the implied covenant exists \"so that the contractual objectives may be achieved,\" Ide Farm, 297 A.2d at 645, it necessarily follows that where there is no contract, there is no duty.  In such circumstances, there is nothing from which the covenant can be implied.

This claim invokes a Massachusetts statute that provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ny person who engages in the conduct of any trade or commerce and who suffers any loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person who engages in any trade or commerce of an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice ... may, as hereinafter provided, bring an action ... for damages....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A, Sec. 11 (1984).  The district court, without making an explicit choice-of-law determination, dismissed the claim on the ground that the interdicted conduct did not occur in trade or commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's chapter 93A claim is really two separate but related claims.  We deal with them seriatim.   The first initiative fails to state a cause of action even if chapter 93A applies, and we dispose of it on that basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  The second initiative is a horse of a different hue;  if chapter 93A applies, it arguably states a claim.  Consequently, we treat the choice-of-law question that necessarily precedes substantive consideration of this initiative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>A.

Although Judge Torres found that ELC had not informed appellant that its participation in the deal would hinge upon the availability of funding, there is no credible evidence that ELC ever made express representations to the contrary.  Thus, even if we assume the truth of the charge, no reasonable factfinder could conclude that ELC's conduct in this respect descended to the level of rascality required for a successful chapter 93A suit.

The Second Half of the Chapter 93A Claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second basis for the appellant's chapter 93A claim arguably consists of sterner stuff.  During pretrial discovery, ELC produced a handwritten credit decision memorandum (CDM) dated November 2, 1990.  Attached to the CDM was a note purportedly written to Mark Patterson, advising him that the handwritten memo superseded a typed CDM of the same vintage.  The difference between the two memoranda is of import.  The typed CDM stated that the sale and leaseback had been approved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  The handwritten version, however, conditioned the approval on a thoroughgoing review of appellant's financial status and a favorable reaction by an ELC funding source.  By the time the case reached trial, appellant had integrated ELC's gamesmanship during discovery with its other purported peccadilloes, and charged that the handwritten CDM was a fake, manufactured after the fact in order to lay the groundwork for ELC's defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume, arguendo, that the described conduct might infract chapter 93A, see generally Quaker State, 884 F.2d at 1513-14 (discussing when tactics in, and related to, ongoing litigation may prove actionable under chapter 93A), we nevertheless must pause at the choice-of-law threshold.  Recognizing that a defendant in a contract case governed by one state's law nonetheless may be subject to the provisions of another state's unfair trade practices statute, see, e.g., Computer Sys. Eng'g, Inc. v. Qantel Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439207\"><a href=\"/opinion/439207/computer-systems-engineering-inc-v-qantel-corporation-computer-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 64 nn. 6, 7 (1st Cir.1984), that result will obtain only if the forum state's choice-of-law rules so dictate, see id. at 70.   Considering this possibility brings into play the principle of depecage, which we have described as \"the framework under which different issues in a single case ... may be decided according to the substantive law of different states.\"  Putnam Resources, 958 F.2d at 465.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For choice-of-law purposes, we treat appellant's chapter 93A initiative as a species of tort claim.  At least one federal court has made the across-the-board assessment that chapter 93A claims \"should be treated uniformly, rather than on a case-by-case basis, in the same way as tort claims.\"  Computer Sys. Eng'g, Inc. v. Qantel Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1494138\"><a href=\"/opinion/1494138/computer-systems-engineering-inc-v-qantel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We need not go so far.  We hold that, at minimum, when a chapter 93A claim and the requested remedy are highly analogous to a tort claim and remedy, the chapter 93A claim should be considered as a tort for choice-of-law purposes.  See id. at 1370-71;  see also Michael C. Gilleran, The Law of Chapter 93A Sec. 12:8, at 413 (1989);  cf. Northeast Data Sys., Inc. v. McDonnell Douglas Computer Sys.

This charge resembles the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation.  Similarly, appellant asked for a tort-like remedy (multiple damages and attorneys' fees).  Thus, we consider this species of chapter 93A claim as falling under the tort rubric for purposes of our choice-of-law assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In tort cases, Rhode Island uses a multipart analysis to determine which of two states has the more significant interest in the resolution of the issue presented in the case.

See Putnam Resources, 958 F.2d at 464-65;  Brown, 252 A.2d at 178;  Woodward, 243 A.2d at 923;  see also Restatement Sec. 6.  In considering these general principles, tort conflict-of-law analysis weighs more heavily the needs of the interstate system, the policies of the interested states as well as the forum, and the ease of determination and application of the law.  See Restatement Sec. 145, cmt. b.  In the tort context, these overarching tenets may take into account a number of other factors, including (1) the place of injury;  (2) the place where the conduct which caused the injury occurred;  (3) the place of incorporation and place of business of each party;  and (4) the locus, or center of gravity, of the parties' relationship.  See Putnam Resources, 958 F.2d at 464;  Fashion House, 892 F.2d at 1092;  Brown, 252 A.2d at 179;  see also Restatement Sec. 145(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An application of these factors reveals that Rhode Island has a more significant interest than Massachusetts in the resolution of this claim.  Appellant initiated negotiations with ELC in Rhode Island--and interstate policy does not dictate prosecution under the Massachusetts statute of every deceptive trade allegation brought against a company headquartered in Massachusetts but doing business in another state.  Rhode Island has a substantial interest in protecting its resident companies from deceptive representations or unfair trade practices, especially those that may occur within its borders.  As it is the forum state, an application of Rhode Island's tort law would be more easily accomplished than an application of Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, too, in addition to the Rhode Island locus of the claimed injury, the allegedly tortious conduct also possesses substantial links to Rhode Island.  Appellant's claim arose when Douglas Crellin visited Mark Patterson at his Rhode Island home and saw the typed version of the CDM.  The coverup itself--if one took place--must have been crafted in the course of pretrial discovery in a Rhode Island forum.  Even if we assume that the handwritten version of the CDM was created in Massachusetts--and there is no proof of that fact--such a contact, standing alone, would not be enough to overcome Rhode Island's interest in compensating a Rhode Island company whose financial well-being was compromised through deceptive acts of a company doing business within Rhode Island.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that to the extent appellant presents a potentially viable unfair trade practices claim, the claim is governed by the substantive law of Rhode Island.  Because that is so, appellant's claim under chapter 93A is not actionable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  See, e.g., Eastland Bank v.

The omitted material would have revealed both a lower net worth and a decreased likelihood of future profitability.  At trial, the district judge found that this omission came about through inadvertence, not through intentional misrepresentation.  Nevertheless, the financial statements, as presented, were both misleading and incomplete</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Unless and until a sale and leaseback transpired, these two documents were meaningless;  neither of them had any independent force</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> At various times, Cretco has argued either that a bilateral contract underpinned the breach of contract count--ELC made a firm offer in November of 1990 and Cretco accepted the offer at that time, subject to a condition (the procuring of Old Stone's consent) that was fulfilled the following March--or, alternately, that ELC extended a unilateral offer, subject to Cretco's later acceptance.  Whichever way the scenario is viewed, the upshot of the litigation remains unaffected</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In this case the district court, while leaving spoor for the cognoscenti, made no explicit choice of law.  We, therefore, write on a pristine page</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Courts and commentators use a variety of compound adjectives, such as \"interest-weighing\" and \"locus-of-interests,\" to describe the more modern approach.  For ease in reference, we employ the term \"interest-weighing.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Choice of law in a contract case requires a court to make a threshold determination as to the efficacy of any choice-of-law provision that the parties may have included in the contract documents.  Here, the draft lease submitted by ELC to Cretco in November 1990 contained a provision for construction and enforcement according to Massachusetts law.  We disregard this provision for three reasons.  First, Cretco never signed the document in question, and the provision did not reappear in later documents.  Second, neither party mentioned the provision in appellate briefs nor argued that it should be given effect.  Third, while section 187 of the Restatement indicates that an effective choice-of-law provision in a contract document generally should be respected, that rule \"is applicable only in situations where it is established to the satisfaction of the forum that the parties have chosen the state [to be the source] of the applicable law.\"   Restatement Sec. 187, cmt. a.
