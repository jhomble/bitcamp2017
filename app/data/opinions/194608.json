R. App. Proc.  Rules 38\n\nand  39  and  28 U.S.C.     1927  for  bringing an  allegedly\n\nfrivolous  appeal.   We  deny the  motion  for double  costs,\n\nattorneys' fees and sanctions  under Rule 38 and 28  U.S.C.  \n\n1927, but award Tropicana its costs under Rule 39.  \n\n                         I.  Background\n                                       \n\n          In May 1992, Tropicana  sued Vero Beach for damages\n\nand preliminary  and  permanent injunctive  relief,  claiming\n\nthat it had violated and continued to violate a prior consent\n\njudgment  of  the district  court  and section  43(a)  of the\n\nLanham Act, 15 U.S.C.    1125(a), by its print advertisements\n\nand television commercials comparing  Tropicana's pasteurized\n\norange   juice  with  Vero  Beach's  non-pasteurized,  fresh-\n\nsqueezed orange juice.   The advertising in question depicted\n\na  carton of Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice atop an open\n\ngas flame next  to a  carton of Vero  Beach's Honestly  Fresh\n\nSqueezed  orange juice  chilling  on a  block  of ice.    The\n\naccompanying text  stated that \".  . . Tropicana  cooks their\n\njuice  before they  package it.   So  when you  see the  word\n\n'pasteurized' on their  carton, you know it  has been cooked.\n\nHonestly Fresh Squeezed orange juice is never cooked.  That's\n\nwhy we can call it fresh squeezed . . . .\"  \n\n                             -2-\n\n          After  a  hearing,   the  district  court   granted\n\nTropicana a temporary restraining order, determining that the\n\nstatement that Tropicana \"cooked\" its orange juice,  together\n\nwith  the picture  of its  orange juice  over an  open flame,\n\nmisrepresented the nature of Tropicana's flash pasteurization\n\nprocess.    After a  further hearing,  the  court on  July 23\n\ngranted Tropicana's request for a preliminary injunction.  At\n\nthat time, a full trial on Tropicana's request for a judgment\n\nof  contempt  and a  permanent  injunction  had already  been\n\nscheduled for November 23.  \n\n          On  August 6,  Vero Beach appealed  the preliminary\n\ninjunction.   Its  initial brief  was due  September 24,  but\n\napproximately one week before the due date Vero Beach  sought\n\nan  extension  of time  in  which  to  file  the brief.    It\n\nrequested  the  extension  because  it wished  to  await  the\n\nresults  of settlement discussions  through the Civil Appeals\n\nManagement Program (CAMP) which were scheduled for October 5.\n\nTwo  days  after the  CAMP hearing  had  failed to  produce a\n\nsettlement, Hinckley,  Allen moved to withdraw  as counsel in\n\nthe  district court  proceedings because  Vero Beach  had not\n\npaid it  any legal fees  since the suit  had begun.   It also\n\nfiled  a  motion  requesting   the  district  court  to  stay\n\ndiscovery and postpone the trial on the merits to permit Vero\n\nBeach time  to find new counsel.   On October  30, Vero Beach\n\n                             -3-\n\nfiled a second motion to extend the time for filing briefs so\n\nthat it could seek substitute counsel.   \n\n          On November 2, the district court granted Hinckley,\n\nAllen's  motion  to withdraw  and  informed  Vero Beach  that\n\ncorporations could  not litigate  pro se  in this  circuit so\n\nthat it would have to accept a default judgment if it did not\n\nfind new  counsel.    The district  court  also  denied  Vero\n\nBeach's  motion to stay discovery and continue the trial.  In\n\na  letter to Tropicana dated November 10 and forwarded to the\n\ndistrict  court,  Vero Beach  stated that  it would  accept a\n\ndefault judgment given its deteriorating  financial condition\n\nand the fact  that it could not proceed pro  se.  On November\n\n23, the court entered a default judgment against Vero  Beach,\n\nfinding that  it had willfully violated  the consent judgment\n\nand  permanently enjoining  it  from any  false or  deceptive\n\nadvertising  or any comparative  advertising relating  to any\n\nTropicana product.  \n\n          On  November  30, Hinckley,  Allen  filed a  motion\n\nunder  Fed.  R.  App. Pro.  Rule  42(b),  to which  Tropicana\n\nassented in  a telephone  call, moving the  court to  dismiss\n\nVero  Beach's appeal  from  the preliminary  injunction.   As\n\ngrounds for  the motion,  the  firm cited  its withdrawal  as\n\ncounsel for Vero  Beach in  the district court  and the  fact\n\nthat  the default  judgment below  rendered the  appeal moot.\n\nThis  court ordered  the  appeal dismissed.   Tropicana  then\n\n                             -4-\n\nfiled its motion for  costs and attorneys' fees  against both\n\nVero Beach and Hinckley, Allen.\n\n                             -5-\n\n                         II. Discussion\n                                       \n\n          Tropicana's request for costs is clearly justified.\n\nRule 39 states that, \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by  law,\n\nif an appeal is  dismissed, costs shall be taxed  against the\n\nappellant unless otherwise ordered  . . . .\"  As  noted, Vero\n\nBeach  voluntarily dismissed  its  appeal  under Rule  42(b),\n\nwhich provides that \"[a]n appeal  may be dismissed on  motion\n\nof the appellant upon such terms as may be agreed upon by the\n\nparties or fixed  by the  court.\"1   Presumably, a  voluntary\n\ndismissal under Rule 42  would come within the terms  of Rule\n\n39, particularly since the notice  of dismissal filed in this\n\ncase did not contain any  indication as to who would  pay the\n\ncosts of  the appeal and Rule  39 addresses that issue.   See\n                                                             \n\nAtlantic Coast Line  R. Co. v.  Wells, 54 F.2d 633,  634 (5th\n                                     \n\nCir. 1932) (costs  of appeal dismissed  by appellant as  moot\n\nwere taxed against appellant under  a rule awarding costs  to\n\n                    \n\n1.  Rule 42(b)  also provides that  \"[i]f the  parties to  an\nappeal  . . . shall sign and file with the clerk of the court\nof  appeals an  agreement that  the proceeding  be dismissed,\nspecifying  the terms as to  payment of costs,  and shall pay\nwhatever  fees  are  due,  the  clerk  shall enter  the  case\ndismissed, .  . . .\"   Since Vero Beach's  motion to dismiss,\nthough  assented  to   by  Tropicana,   contained  no   terms\nspecifying who would pay the costs and fees and dismissal was\neffected  through  an order  of  this court,  the  appeal was\nactually dismissed under the portion of the rule quoted above\nin  the text of our  opinion.  See  Clarendon Ltd. v. Nu-West\n                                                             \nIndustries, Inc., 936 F.2d 127, 128 (3d Cir. 1991).  \n                \n\n                             -6-\n\nappellee  whenever  an   appeal  is  dismissed,  except   for\n\njurisdictional reasons).   \n\n          Rule  38 provides  that the  court may  award \"just\n\ndamages and single  or double  costs to the  appellee\" if  it\n\ndetermines  that an  appeal  was \"frivolous.\"   Just  damages\n\nincludes attorneys' fees.

An\n                 \n\nappeal  is  frivolous  if   the  \"result  was  obvious,\"  the\n\n\"overwhelming   weight   of  precedent   militate[d]  against\n\n[appellant's] position,\" or there was \"no legitimate  ground\"\n\nfor the appeal, or if the appellant failed to set forth facts\n\nto support  its legal theory.

Wells\n                                                             \n\nFargo Alarm Services,  907 F.2d 1274,  1280 (1st Cir.  1990).\n                    \n\nTo find an appeal frivolous, the  court need not find that it\n\nwas brought in  bad faith or  with malice.   \"[I]t is  enough\n\nthat the appellants and their attorney should have been aware\n                                             \n\nthat the appeal had no chance of  success.\"  Id. (emphasis in\n                                                \n\noriginal).  \n\n          Under 28 U.S.C.    1927, \"any attorney . . . who so\n\nmultiplies  the  proceedings  in any  case  unreasonably  and\n\nvexatiously  may   be  required  by  the   court  to  satisfy\n\npersonally  the  excess costs,  expenses  and  attorneys fees\n\nreasonably incurred because of  such conduct.\"  An attorney's\n\nbad faith in bringing an appeal will always justify sanctions\n\nunder section 1927, but bad faith need not be shown to obtain\n\n                             -7-\n\nsanctions.   Cruz v. Savage,  896 F.2d 626,  631-32 (1st Cir.\n                           \n\n1990).   Rather,  sanctions are  justified \"if  an attorney's\n\nconduct  in  multiplying   proceedings  is  unreasonable  and\n\nharassing  or annoying\" in an objective sense.  \"It is enough\n\nthat an  attorney acts  in disregard  of whether  his conduct\n\nconstitutes  harassment   or  vexation,  thus   displaying  a\n\n'serious  and studied  disregard for  the orderly  process of\n\njustice.'\"   Id.  (citation omitted).   However,  the conduct\n                \n\nmust be  \"more severe than mere  negligence, inadvertence, or\n\nincompetence . . . .\"  Id.   Bringing  a \"frivolous, dilatory\n                          \n\nand  vexatious\" appeal would warrant an award of double costs\n\nagainst  an attorney under Rule 38 and an award of attorneys'\n\nfees under section 1927.  Id. at 635.  \n                             \n\n          Accordingly, Tropicana's ability  to obtain  double\n\ncosts and  attorneys' fees  against Vero Beach  and Hinckley,\n\nAllen turns  essentially on  the question whether  the appeal\n\nwas frivolous,  although Tropicana  could also recover  if it\n\nshowed  bad  faith,  unreasonable  or  vexatious  conduct  in\n\n\"multiplying\" the proceedings, or  some \"serious and  studied\n\ndisregard  for the  orderly process  of justice.\"   Tropicana\n\nalleges that Vero Beach's likelihood of persuading this court\n\nto vacate the  preliminary injunction was \"non-existent\"  and\n\ndecries the \"total and  obvious meritlessness\" of the appeal.\n\nYet it makes  no attempt to explain to us  why the appeal was\n\nsubstantively  frivolous  --  its  brief  is  devoid  of  any\n\n                             -8-\n\nreference  to the  legal  issues considered  by the  district\n\ncourt  in granting the injunction.  Because Tropicana has not\n\naddressed the issue, and this appeal was dismissed before the\n\nparties submitted  their briefs,  we do not  consider whether\n\nthe appeal had merit or was substantively frivolous. \n\n          Tropicana argues  that the  decision to  appeal the\n\npreliminary  injunction  was   ill-considered,  wasteful   of\n\njudicial resources and  caused undue  expense for  Tropicana.\n\nThus,  its argument  appears to  be one based  essentially on\n\nsection 1927 standards -- that Vero Beach and Hinckley, Allen\n\nunreasonably  and  vexatiously  multiplied   proceedings  and\n\nshowed  a disregard  for the  orderly process  of justice  in\n\nbringing  the appeal  in  the first  place  and then  in  not\n\nprosecuting  it  appropriately.   To  support  its  argument,\n\nTropicana makes  the following points.   Hinckley, Allen must\n\nhave known to  a certainty that the appeal would not be heard\n\nbefore the full  trial on the  merits, yet  the firm did  not\n\nfile a motion  for an  expedited hearing.2   To make  matters\n\nworse,  the firm did not  file a timely  appellate brief, but\n\ntwice sought extensions.   In  fact, as it  turned out,  Vero\n\n                    \n\n2.  Tropicana  also  states  that  Vero  Beach's  appeal  was\ninterlocutory and \"not  certified for immediate  or expedited\nappeal,\" but does  not elaborate  on this point.   We do  not\nunderstand why the appeal should have been certified since 28\nU.S.C.    1292(a) clearly gives this  court jurisdiction over\nappeals from  \"[i]nterlocutory orders of the  district courts\nof the United States . . .  granting . . . injunctions . .  .\n.\"\n\n                             -9-\n\nBeach  never  filed any  brief at  all.   Moreover, Hinckley,\n\nAllen  failed  to move  promptly  to  dismiss  the appeal  or\n\nwithdraw its appearance  before this court after  it moved to\n\nwithdraw  as counsel  for Vero Beach  in the  district court.\n\nVero  Beach did  not stipulate  to dismiss  the appeal  until\n\nafter  it  was  defaulted  in  the  district  court, and  its\n\ndecision to  accept the  default judgment rather  than retain\n\nsuccessor counsel demonstrated that it had never been serious\n\nabout the appeal.   Furthermore, once the parties had  agreed\n\nto dismiss the  appeal, Hinckley, Allen  filed its motion  to\n\ndismiss the appeal  without first forwarding a draft  copy of\n\nthe motion to Tropicana for inclusion of terms on the payment\n\nof costs and fees, as Tropicana had expressly asked it to do.\n\nFinally, the appeal  was basically motivated by  a desire \"to\n\nget away  from Judge Keeton who was  well versed in the facts\n\nand  applicable law, and [to] obtain a more friendly forum in\n\nthe court of appeals.\"  \n\n          The points  made by Tropicana do not persuade us to\n\naward double costs and attorneys' fees against Vero Beach and\n\nHinckley, Allen.    Although it  was  not a  \"certainty\",  as\n\nTropicana  asserts,  that the  appeal  would  not be  decided\n\nbefore the  trial on the merits,  it is probably true  that a\n\ndecision by  us before the  trial was unlikely.   It  is also\n\ntrue  that Hinckley,  Allen  did not  file  a motion  for  an\n\nexpedited appeal, but its failure to do so does not mean that\n\n                             -10-\n\nthe appeal  was ill-considered.  Hinckley,  Allen did attempt\n\nto stay discovery and  to continue the trial in  the district\n\ncourt.  Although it filed its stay motion two months after it\n\nhad  noticed  its appeal,  the  motion was  filed  almost two\n\nmonths before  the date  of the trial.   Had the  motion been\n\ngranted,  a matter which was outside  its control, the appeal\n\nwould have been heard before the trial on the merits.  \n\n          Furthermore, Vero  Beach's  motions to  extend  the\n\ntime  for filing its  brief were  made for  good cause.   The\n\nrecord shows that  the parties  were unable  to schedule  the\n\nCAMP hearing until  after Vero Beach's brief was  due because\n\nthe judge who was to preside over the hearing was unavailable\n\nbefore that time.  It was no abuse of process  for Vero Beach\n\nto request  an extension  of time under  those circumstances.\n\nHad  Vero Beach timely filed  its brief and  then settled the\n\ncase,  it would have incurred  an unnecessary expense, a very\n\nlegitimate concern for a company in financial trouble.  Since\n\nVero Beach's brief was  due almost two weeks before  the CAMP\n\nhearing,  Tropicana  would  likely have  begun  preparing its\n\nresponse before  the hearing was held,  thereby incurring its\n\nown expenses that would have  proven unnecessary had the case\n\nsettled.  In addition, Vero Beach moved to extend the initial\n\ntime for  filing its brief  over a week before  the brief was\n\nactually due, further indicating that it sought the extension\n\nfor valid reasons and not just as a delaying tactic.  \n\n                             -11-\n\n          The second extension which Vero Beach requested was\n\nalso justified.  It  seems clear that Vero Beach  needed some\n\nreasonable  period of time in which to seek new counsel after\n\nHinckley,  Allen  announced   its  desire  to   withdraw  its\n\nrepresentation.  The  request for an extension  until the end\n\nof November was not excessive -- not only did Vero Beach need\n\nto locate new counsel, but its new counsel would have had  to\n\nreview  the lengthy  record  below, evaluate  the issues  and\n\nprepare  a brief.  At  the time the  extension was requested,\n\nthe  district court had not yet denied Vero Beach's motion to\n\npostpone  the trial on the  merits so that  further action on\n\nthe  appeal  was feasible.    Accordingly,  we conclude  that\n\nHinckley, Allen  and Vero  Beach acted reasonably  in seeking\n\nthese extensions,  in a way  calculated to save  both parties\n\nunnecessary expenses  and to  conserve the resources  of this\n\ncourt as well.  \n\n          We  see  no  improper  dilatoriness   in  Hinckley,\n\nAllen's failure to seek immediately to withdraw its appellate\n\nrepresentation of Vero Beach or to  have the appeal dismissed\n\nafter it filed  its motion  to withdraw as  counsel for  Vero\n\nBeach  in  the  district  court.   Hinckley,  Allen  informed\n\nTropicana at the  hearing on November  2 that its  withdrawal\n\nfrom representation  would apply  to the  appeal as  well and\n\nthat  Vero  Beach's  new   counsel  should  be  permitted  to\n\ndetermine the status of the appeal,  a point that seems to us\n\n                             -12-\n\nan indisputably valid  one.   The firm also  arguably had  an\n\nobligation to ensure that its withdrawal  from representation\n\nproceeded  in a  way  that would  not  adversely impact  Vero\n\nBeach's interests,  and permitting  Vero  Beach a  reasonable\n\nperiod of time to find new counsel who could evaluate whether\n\nthe  appeal  should proceed  would  be  consistent with  that\n\nobligation.

Moreover,  the transcript  of  the November  2 hearing\n\nshows that, already  then, Vero Beach was  attempting to find\n\nnew  counsel,  but having  difficulty  doing so.    Under the\n\ncircumstances, Hinckley, Allen may  have decided that it made\n\nmost sense  to continue  its representation at  the appellate\n\nlevel  in case it was needed to  file a motion to dismiss the\n\n                             -13-\n\nappeal on Vero Beach's  behalf, which, as it turned  out, the\n\nfirm eventually did.\n\n          We doubt that Tropicana means to suggest  seriously\n\nthat Hinckley, Allen  had some obligation  to try to  dismiss\n\nthe appeal on  its own since only  Vero Beach could  make the\n\ndefinitive  decision to do so.  Nor does Vero Beach's failure\n\nto dismiss the appeal  until November 30  seem to us to  have\n\nbeen unduly  untimely.   In Tropicana's presence,  Vero Beach\n\nwas informed on November 2 that it could not litigate in this\n\ncircuit without being represented by counsel.  By letter sent\n\neight  days later,  it  informed Tropicana  and the  district\n\ncourt that, given its  deteriorating financial condition,  it\n\nwould  not  retain new  counsel  and would  accept  a default\n\njudgment  on November 23.   Thus, within two  weeks after the\n\nconditions arose which made it more difficult for  Vero Beach\n\nto  proceed before  the district  court or  to  prosecute its\n\nappeal, Tropicana  knew  that it  would win  in the  district\n\ncourt and that the appeal would have to be dismissed.   Under\n\nthose circumstances, the failure  to formally file the motion\n\nto dismiss until the end of November cannot  be regarded as a\n\nvexatious,   annoying   or   unreasonably  dilatory   action.\n\nMoreover, our  docket indicates that no action  on the appeal\n\nwas taken  by either party  or by the  court in  November, so\n\nthat the  failure to dismiss  the appeal earlier  in November\n\n                             -14-\n\nclearly caused no  undue expense  for Tropicana  or waste  of\n\njudicial resources.3  \n\n          Nor are we persuaded  that Vero Beach's decision to\n\naccept a default judgment in the district court shows that it\n\nhad  not  brought  its  appeal  seriously.    As  the  record\n\ndemonstrates, the district court  informed Vero Beach that it\n\nwould have to accept  a default judgment  if it did not  find\n\nsubstitute counsel since a corporation may not  appear pro se\n\nin this circuit.   The  record also shows  Vero Beach's  poor\n\nfinancial  condition, which  had  rendered it  unable to  pay\n\nHinckley,  Allen's  bills and  apparently  had  also made  it\n\nimpossible  to   find  replacement   counsel.    Given   this\n\nunresolvable tangle,  Vero Beach's acceptance of  the default\n\njudgment cannot possibly reflect  adversely on its motivation\n\nin bringing the appeal in the first place.  \n\n          Tropicana    suggests    that    Hinckley,    Allen\n\ndeliberately  filed its  assented-to  motion to  dismiss  the\n\nappeal before  Tropicana could append its  statement of costs\n\nand fees to  the motion.   A careful  reading of  Tropicana's\n\nasseverations regarding the relevant  events suggests no such\n\ndeliberateness.  In its  memorandum supporting its motion for\n\nfees  and costs,  Tropicana states  that it  informed William\n\n                    \n\n3.  We realize that Tropicana  sent a letter to the  clerk of\nthis court on November  3, to which the clerk  responded, but\nTropicana's  letter responded  to  the  court's October  30th\norder  granting Vero  Beach a  second  extension of  time for\nfiling its brief.\n\n                             -15-\n\nMoore,   a   Hinckley,  Allen   attorney,   in   a  telephone\n\nconversation  on November 25  that it would  agree to dismiss\n\nthe appeal, but that it intended to \"seek an Order\" for costs\n\nand  fees.     As  phrased,  Tropicana's   comment  is  fully\n\nconsistent with  an intent  to file  a separate  petition for\n\nfees  with this court, which it eventually did.  The specific\n\nrequest  that   Hinckley,  Allen  send  it   a  draft  motion\n\ndismissing the appeal so that it could append its request for\n\nfees and costs to the motion was made  separately in a letter\n\ndated November 25, the  same day the phone  conversation took\n\nplace.  Although that  letter was sent by facsimile  and thus\n\npresumably arrived the day it was sent, it was addressed to a\n\ndifferent Hinckley, Allen attorney,  Steven Comen, and not to\n\nMoore  who  appears to  have  been  the one  responsible  for\n\npreparing  the  motion.    November  25  was  the day  before\n\nThanksgiving.   Moore filed the  motion to dismiss by mailing\n\nit on Monday, November  30, the first business day  after the\n\nintervening  weekend.  In its memorandum opposing Tropicana's\n\nrequest for fees, Hinckley, Allen explains that \"[t]he letter\n\n. . . due to the Thanksgiving holiday  crossed paths with the\n\nAssented-to Motion.\"  From that we infer that Hinckley, Allen\n\nis saying that, because of the holiday, Comen did not receive\n\nTropicana's letter in time to direct Moore to send a draft of\n\nthe  motion to dismiss to Tropicana  before filing the motion\n\nwith this  court.  The present  record gives us no  reason to\n\n                             -16-\n\ndoubt the firm's  explanation, although  we note  that it  is\n\nsomewhat ambiguously phrased.    \n\n          We need  not spend long  on Tropicana's  allegation\n\nthat Vero Beach  brought its appeal  in an attempt to  find a\n\nmore receptive  forum for  its arguments.   Absent  a showing\n\nthat  the appeal itself had no  substantive legal merit, that\n\nmotivation  alone would not support  an award of double costs\n\nand  attorneys'  fees.   We have  no  doubt that  appeals are\n\ngenerally  brought in  an attempt  to receive  more favorable\n\ntreatment from us than that accorded by the trial court.    \n\n                         III. Conclusion\n                                        \n\n          Tropicana's  request  for  costs under  Rule  39 is\n\ngranted.  Its  request for double  costs and attorneys'  fees\n\nunder Rule  38 and for  sanctions under  28 U.S.C.    1927 is\n\ndenied.  \n\n                             -17-\n",

Background\n                                       \n\n          In May 1992, Tropicana  sued Vero Beach for damages\n\nand preliminary  and  permanent injunctive  relief,  claiming\n\nthat it had violated and continued to violate a prior consent\n\njudgment  of  the district  court  and section  43(a)  of the\n\nLanham Act, 15 U.S.C.    1125(a), by its print advertisements\n\nand television commercials comparing  Tropicana's pasteurized\n\norange   juice  with  Vero  Beach's  non-pasteurized,  fresh-\n\nsqueezed orange juice.   The advertising in question depicted\n\na  carton of Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice atop an open\n\ngas flame next  to a  carton of Vero  Beach's Honestly  Fresh\n\nSqueezed  orange juice  chilling  on a  block  of ice.    The\n\naccompanying text  stated that \".  . . Tropicana  cooks their\n\njuice  before they  package it.   So  when you  see the  word\n\n'pasteurized' on their  carton, you know it  has been cooked.\n\nHonestly Fresh Squeezed orange juice is never cooked.  That's\n\nwhy we can call it fresh squeezed . . . .\"  \n\n                             -2-\n\n          After  a  hearing,   the  district  court   granted\n\nTropicana a temporary restraining order, determining that the\n\nstatement that Tropicana \"cooked\" its orange juice,  together\n\nwith  the picture  of its  orange juice  over an  open flame,\n\nmisrepresented the nature of Tropicana's flash pasteurization\n\nprocess.    After a  further hearing,  the  court on  July 23\n\ngranted Tropicana's request for a preliminary injunction.  At\n\nthat time, a full trial on Tropicana's request for a judgment\n\nof  contempt  and a  permanent  injunction  had already  been\n\nscheduled for November 23.  \n\n          On  August 6,  Vero Beach appealed  the preliminary\n\ninjunction.   Its  initial brief  was due  September 24,  but\n\napproximately one week before the due date Vero Beach  sought\n\nan  extension  of time  in  which  to  file  the brief.    It\n\nrequested  the  extension  because  it wished  to  await  the\n\nresults  of settlement discussions  through the Civil Appeals\n\nManagement Program (CAMP) which were scheduled for October 5.\n\nTwo  days  after the  CAMP hearing  had  failed to  produce a\n\nsettlement, Hinckley,  Allen moved to withdraw  as counsel in\n\nthe  district court  proceedings because  Vero Beach  had not\n\npaid it  any legal fees  since the suit  had begun.   It also\n\nfiled  a  motion  requesting   the  district  court  to  stay\n\ndiscovery and postpone the trial on the merits to permit Vero\n\nBeach time  to find new counsel.   On October  30, Vero Beach\n\n                             -3-\n\nfiled a second motion to extend the time for filing briefs so\n\nthat it could seek substitute counsel.   \n\n          On November 2, the district court granted Hinckley,\n\nAllen's  motion  to withdraw  and  informed  Vero Beach  that\n\ncorporations could  not litigate  pro se  in this  circuit so\n\nthat it would have to accept a default judgment if it did not\n\nfind new  counsel.    The district  court  also  denied  Vero\n\nBeach's  motion to stay discovery and continue the trial.  In\n\na  letter to Tropicana dated November 10 and forwarded to the\n\ndistrict  court,  Vero Beach  stated that  it would  accept a\n\ndefault judgment given its deteriorating  financial condition\n\nand the fact  that it could not proceed pro  se.  On November\n\n23, the court entered a default judgment against Vero  Beach,\n\nfinding that  it had willfully violated  the consent judgment\n\nand  permanently enjoining  it  from any  false or  deceptive\n\nadvertising  or any comparative  advertising relating  to any\n\nTropicana product.  \n\n          On  November  30, Hinckley,  Allen  filed a  motion\n\nunder  Fed.  R.  App. Pro.  Rule  42(b),  to which  Tropicana\n\nassented in  a telephone  call, moving the  court to  dismiss\n\nVero  Beach's appeal  from  the preliminary  injunction.   As\n\ngrounds for  the motion,  the  firm cited  its withdrawal  as\n\ncounsel for Vero  Beach in  the district court  and the  fact\n\nthat  the default  judgment below  rendered the  appeal moot.\n\nThis  court ordered  the  appeal dismissed.   Tropicana  then\n\n                             -4-\n\nfiled its motion for  costs and attorneys' fees  against both\n\nVero Beach and Hinckley, Allen.\n\n                             -5-\n\n                         II. Discussion\n                                       \n\n          Tropicana's request for costs is clearly justified.\n\nRule 39 states that, \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by  law,\n\nif an appeal is  dismissed, costs shall be taxed  against the\n\nappellant unless otherwise ordered  . . . .\"  As  noted, Vero\n\nBeach  voluntarily dismissed  its  appeal  under Rule  42(b),\n\nwhich provides that \"[a]n appeal  may be dismissed on  motion\n\nof the appellant upon such terms as may be agreed upon by the\n\nparties or fixed  by the  court.\"1   Presumably, a  voluntary\n\ndismissal under Rule 42  would come within the terms  of Rule\n\n39, particularly since the notice  of dismissal filed in this\n\ncase did not contain any  indication as to who would  pay the\n\ncosts of  the appeal and Rule  39 addresses that issue.

Id. at 635.  \n                             \n\n          Accordingly, Tropicana's ability  to obtain  double\n\ncosts and  attorneys' fees  against Vero Beach  and Hinckley,\n\nAllen turns  essentially on  the question whether  the appeal\n\nwas frivolous,  although Tropicana  could also recover  if it\n\nshowed  bad  faith,  unreasonable  or  vexatious  conduct  in\n\n\"multiplying\" the proceedings, or  some \"serious and  studied\n\ndisregard  for the  orderly process  of justice.\"   Tropicana\n\nalleges that Vero Beach's likelihood of persuading this court\n\nto vacate the  preliminary injunction was \"non-existent\"  and\n\ndecries the \"total and  obvious meritlessness\" of the appeal.\n\nYet it makes  no attempt to explain to us  why the appeal was\n\nsubstantively  frivolous  --  its  brief  is  devoid  of  any\n\n                             -8-\n\nreference  to the  legal  issues considered  by the  district\n\ncourt  in granting the injunction.  Because Tropicana has not\n\naddressed the issue, and this appeal was dismissed before the\n\nparties submitted  their briefs,  we do not  consider whether\n\nthe appeal had merit or was substantively frivolous. \n\n          Tropicana argues  that the  decision to  appeal the\n\npreliminary  injunction  was   ill-considered,  wasteful   of\n\njudicial resources and  caused undue  expense for  Tropicana.\n\nThus,  its argument  appears to  be one based  essentially on\n\nsection 1927 standards -- that Vero Beach and Hinckley, Allen\n\nunreasonably  and  vexatiously  multiplied   proceedings  and\n\nshowed  a disregard  for the  orderly process  of justice  in\n\nbringing  the appeal  in  the first  place  and then  in  not\n\nprosecuting  it  appropriately.   To  support  its  argument,\n\nTropicana makes  the following points.   Hinckley, Allen must\n\nhave known to  a certainty that the appeal would not be heard\n\nbefore the full  trial on the  merits, yet  the firm did  not\n\nfile a motion  for an  expedited hearing.2   To make  matters\n\nworse,  the firm did not  file a timely  appellate brief, but\n\ntwice sought extensions.   In  fact, as it  turned out,  Vero\n\n                    \n\n2.  Tropicana  also  states  that  Vero  Beach's  appeal  was\ninterlocutory and \"not  certified for immediate  or expedited\nappeal,\" but does  not elaborate  on this point.   We do  not\nunderstand why the appeal should have been certified since 28\nU.S.C.    1292(a) clearly gives this  court jurisdiction over\nappeals from  \"[i]nterlocutory orders of the  district courts\nof the United States . . .  granting . . . injunctions . .  .\n.\"\n\n                             -9-\n\nBeach  never  filed any  brief at  all.   Moreover, Hinckley,\n\nAllen  failed  to move  promptly  to  dismiss  the appeal  or\n\nwithdraw its appearance  before this court after  it moved to\n\nwithdraw  as counsel  for Vero Beach  in the  district court.\n\nVero  Beach did  not stipulate  to dismiss  the appeal  until\n\nafter  it  was  defaulted  in  the  district  court, and  its\n\ndecision to  accept the  default judgment rather  than retain\n\nsuccessor counsel demonstrated that it had never been serious\n\nabout the appeal.   Furthermore, once the parties had  agreed\n\nto dismiss the  appeal, Hinckley, Allen  filed its motion  to\n\ndismiss the appeal  without first forwarding a draft  copy of\n\nthe motion to Tropicana for inclusion of terms on the payment\n\nof costs and fees, as Tropicana had expressly asked it to do.\n\nFinally, the appeal  was basically motivated by  a desire \"to\n\nget away  from Judge Keeton who was  well versed in the facts\n\nand  applicable law, and [to] obtain a more friendly forum in\n\nthe court of appeals.\"  \n\n          The points  made by Tropicana do not persuade us to\n\naward double costs and attorneys' fees against Vero Beach and\n\nHinckley, Allen.    Although it  was  not a  \"certainty\",  as\n\nTropicana  asserts,  that the  appeal  would  not be  decided\n\nbefore the  trial on the merits,  it is probably true  that a\n\ndecision by  us before the  trial was unlikely.   It  is also\n\ntrue  that Hinckley,  Allen  did not  file  a motion  for  an\n\nexpedited appeal, but its failure to do so does not mean that\n\n                             -10-\n\nthe appeal  was ill-considered.  Hinckley,  Allen did attempt\n\nto stay discovery and  to continue the trial in  the district\n\ncourt.  Although it filed its stay motion two months after it\n\nhad  noticed  its appeal,  the  motion was  filed  almost two\n\nmonths before  the date  of the trial.   Had the  motion been\n\ngranted,  a matter which was outside  its control, the appeal\n\nwould have been heard before the trial on the merits.  \n\n          Furthermore, Vero  Beach's  motions to  extend  the\n\ntime  for filing its  brief were  made for  good cause.   The\n\nrecord shows that  the parties  were unable  to schedule  the\n\nCAMP hearing until  after Vero Beach's brief was  due because\n\nthe judge who was to preside over the hearing was unavailable\n\nbefore that time.  It was no abuse of process  for Vero Beach\n\nto request  an extension  of time under  those circumstances.\n\nHad  Vero Beach timely filed  its brief and  then settled the\n\ncase,  it would have incurred  an unnecessary expense, a very\n\nlegitimate concern for a company in financial trouble.  Since\n\nVero Beach's brief was  due almost two weeks before  the CAMP\n\nhearing,  Tropicana  would  likely have  begun  preparing its\n\nresponse before  the hearing was held,  thereby incurring its\n\nown expenses that would have  proven unnecessary had the case\n\nsettled.  In addition, Vero Beach moved to extend the initial\n\ntime for  filing its brief  over a week before  the brief was\n\nactually due, further indicating that it sought the extension\n\nfor valid reasons and not just as a delaying tactic.  \n\n                             -11-\n\n          The second extension which Vero Beach requested was\n\nalso justified.  It  seems clear that Vero Beach  needed some\n\nreasonable  period of time in which to seek new counsel after\n\nHinckley,  Allen  announced   its  desire  to   withdraw  its\n\nrepresentation.  The  request for an extension  until the end\n\nof November was not excessive -- not only did Vero Beach need\n\nto locate new counsel, but its new counsel would have had  to\n\nreview  the lengthy  record  below, evaluate  the issues  and\n\nprepare  a brief.  At  the time the  extension was requested,\n\nthe  district court had not yet denied Vero Beach's motion to\n\npostpone  the trial on the  merits so that  further action on\n\nthe  appeal  was feasible.    Accordingly,  we conclude  that\n\nHinckley, Allen  and Vero  Beach acted reasonably  in seeking\n\nthese extensions,  in a way  calculated to save  both parties\n\nunnecessary expenses  and to  conserve the resources  of this\n\ncourt as well.  \n\n          We  see  no  improper  dilatoriness   in  Hinckley,\n\nAllen's failure to seek immediately to withdraw its appellate\n\nrepresentation of Vero Beach or to  have the appeal dismissed\n\nafter it filed  its motion  to withdraw as  counsel for  Vero\n\nBeach  in  the  district  court.   Hinckley,  Allen  informed\n\nTropicana at the  hearing on November  2 that its  withdrawal\n\nfrom representation  would apply  to the  appeal as  well and\n\nthat  Vero  Beach's  new   counsel  should  be  permitted  to\n\ndetermine the status of the appeal,  a point that seems to us\n\n                             -12-\n\nan indisputably valid  one.   The firm also  arguably had  an\n\nobligation to ensure that its withdrawal  from representation\n\nproceeded  in a  way  that would  not  adversely impact  Vero\n\nBeach's interests,  and permitting  Vero  Beach a  reasonable\n\nperiod of time to find new counsel who could evaluate whether\n\nthe  appeal  should proceed  would  be  consistent with  that\n\nobligation.   Cf.  ABA Model  Rules of  Professional Conduct,\n                 \n\nRule  1.16(b) (\"a  lawyer  may withdraw  from representing  a\n\nclient if  withdrawal  can be  accomplished without  material\n\nadverse  effect  on the  interests of  the client\");  id. (d)\n                                                         \n\n(\"[u]pon termination of  representation, a lawyer  shall take\n\nsteps  to  the extent  reasonably  practicable  to protect  a\n\nclient's  interests,  such  as  .  .  .  allowing  time   for\n\nemployment of  other counsel .  . .  .\"); see also  ABA Model\n                                                  \n\nCode of Professional Responsibility, DR  2-110(A)(2) (\"In any\n\nevent,  a lawyer shall not  withdraw from employment until he\n\nhas taken reasonable steps  to avoid foreseeable prejudice to\n\nthe  rights of his client, including giving due notice to his\n\nclient,  allowing time for employment of other counsel, . . .\n\n.\").   Moreover,  the transcript  of  the November  2 hearing\n\nshows that, already  then, Vero Beach was  attempting to find\n\nnew  counsel,  but having  difficulty  doing so.    Under the\n\ncircumstances, Hinckley, Allen may  have decided that it made\n\nmost sense  to continue  its representation at  the appellate\n\nlevel  in case it was needed to  file a motion to dismiss the\n\n                             -13-\n\nappeal on Vero Beach's  behalf, which, as it turned  out, the\n\nfirm eventually did.\n\n          We doubt that Tropicana means to suggest  seriously\n\nthat Hinckley, Allen  had some obligation  to try to  dismiss\n\nthe appeal on  its own since only  Vero Beach could  make the\n\ndefinitive  decision to do so.  Nor does Vero Beach's failure\n\nto dismiss the appeal  until November 30  seem to us to  have\n\nbeen unduly  untimely.   In Tropicana's presence,  Vero Beach\n\nwas informed on November 2 that it could not litigate in this\n\ncircuit without being represented by counsel.  By letter sent\n\neight  days later,  it  informed Tropicana  and the  district\n\ncourt that, given its  deteriorating financial condition,  it\n\nwould  not  retain new  counsel  and would  accept  a default\n\njudgment  on November 23.   Thus, within two  weeks after the\n\nconditions arose which made it more difficult for  Vero Beach\n\nto  proceed before  the district  court or  to  prosecute its\n\nappeal, Tropicana  knew  that it  would win  in the  district\n\ncourt and that the appeal would have to be dismissed.   Under\n\nthose circumstances, the failure  to formally file the motion\n\nto dismiss until the end of November cannot  be regarded as a\n\nvexatious,   annoying   or   unreasonably  dilatory   action.\n\nMoreover, our  docket indicates that no action  on the appeal\n\nwas taken  by either party  or by the  court in  November, so\n\nthat the  failure to dismiss  the appeal earlier  in November\n\n                             -14-\n\nclearly caused no  undue expense  for Tropicana  or waste  of\n\njudicial resources.3  \n\n          Nor are we persuaded  that Vero Beach's decision to\n\naccept a default judgment in the district court shows that it\n\nhad  not  brought  its  appeal  seriously.    As  the  record\n\ndemonstrates, the district court  informed Vero Beach that it\n\nwould have to accept  a default judgment  if it did not  find\n\nsubstitute counsel since a corporation may not  appear pro se\n\nin this circuit.   The  record also shows  Vero Beach's  poor\n\nfinancial  condition, which  had  rendered it  unable to  pay\n\nHinckley,  Allen's  bills and  apparently  had  also made  it\n\nimpossible  to   find  replacement   counsel.    Given   this\n\nunresolvable tangle,  Vero Beach's acceptance of  the default\n\njudgment cannot possibly reflect  adversely on its motivation\n\nin bringing the appeal in the first place.  \n\n          Tropicana    suggests    that    Hinckley,    Allen\n\ndeliberately  filed its  assented-to  motion to  dismiss  the\n\nappeal before  Tropicana could append its  statement of costs\n\nand fees to  the motion.   A careful  reading of  Tropicana's\n\nasseverations regarding the relevant  events suggests no such\n\ndeliberateness.  In its  memorandum supporting its motion for\n\nfees  and costs,  Tropicana states  that it  informed William\n\n                    \n\n3.  We realize that Tropicana  sent a letter to the  clerk of\nthis court on November  3, to which the clerk  responded, but\nTropicana's  letter responded  to  the  court's October  30th\norder  granting Vero  Beach a  second  extension of  time for\nfiling its brief.\n\n                             -15-\n\nMoore,   a   Hinckley,  Allen   attorney,   in   a  telephone\n\nconversation  on November 25  that it would  agree to dismiss\n\nthe appeal, but that it intended to \"seek an Order\" for costs\n\nand  fees.     As  phrased,  Tropicana's   comment  is  fully\n\nconsistent with  an intent  to file  a separate  petition for\n\nfees  with this court, which it eventually did.  The specific\n\nrequest  that   Hinckley,  Allen  send  it   a  draft  motion\n\ndismissing the appeal so that it could append its request for\n\nfees and costs to the motion was made  separately in a letter\n\ndated November 25, the  same day the phone  conversation took\n\nplace.  Although that  letter was sent by facsimile  and thus\n\npresumably arrived the day it was sent, it was addressed to a\n\ndifferent Hinckley, Allen attorney,  Steven Comen, and not to\n\nMoore  who  appears to  have  been  the one  responsible  for\n\npreparing  the  motion.    November  25  was  the day  before\n\nThanksgiving.   Moore filed the  motion to dismiss by mailing\n\nit on Monday, November  30, the first business day  after the\n\nintervening  weekend.  In its memorandum opposing Tropicana's\n\nrequest for fees, Hinckley, Allen explains that \"[t]he letter\n\n. . . due to the Thanksgiving holiday  crossed paths with the\n\nAssented-to Motion.\"  From that we infer that Hinckley, Allen\n\nis saying that, because of the holiday, Comen did not receive\n\nTropicana's letter in time to direct Moore to send a draft of\n\nthe  motion to dismiss to Tropicana  before filing the motion\n\nwith this  court.  The present  record gives us no  reason to\n\n                             -16-\n\ndoubt the firm's  explanation, although  we note  that it  is\n\nsomewhat ambiguously phrased.    \n\n          We need  not spend long  on Tropicana's  allegation\n\nthat Vero Beach  brought its appeal  in an attempt to  find a\n\nmore receptive  forum for  its arguments.   Absent  a showing\n\nthat  the appeal itself had no  substantive legal merit, that\n\nmotivation  alone would not support  an award of double costs\n\nand  attorneys'  fees.   We have  no  doubt that  appeals are\n\ngenerally  brought in  an attempt  to receive  more favorable\n\ntreatment from us than that accorded by the trial court.    \n\n                         III. Conclusion\n                                        \n\n          Tropicana's  request  for  costs under  Rule  39 is\n\ngranted.  Its  request for double  costs and attorneys'  fees\n\nunder Rule  38 and for  sanctions under  28 U.S.C.    1927 is\n\ndenied.  \n\n                             -17-\n</pre>",
