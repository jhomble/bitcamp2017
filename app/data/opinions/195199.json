That, in the abstract,  is the enigma posed by this  case.\n\nFortunately, we need not answer it directly.   As a court of law,\n\nwe leave such metaphysical rumination to the disciples of Jacques\n\nDerrida,  and address  ourselves instead  to  the more  tractable\n\nquestion  of  whether the  Army  Corps of  Engineers  (the Corps)\n\nproperly deemed  two  particular  houseboats  to  be  permanently\n\nmoored structures within the meaning  of section 10 of the Rivers\n\nand  Harbors Act,  33 U.S.C.    403 (1988).   The  district court\n\nruled  that the  Corps did  not act  arbitrarily or  capriciously\n\neither   in   subjecting  the   houseboats   to   the  permitting\n\nrequirements of section 10 or  in refusing to issue permits.   We\n\naffirm.  \n\n                                I\n\n          La Parguera is a bay in Puerto Rico acknowledged by all\n\ninterested  agencies  and   groups  to  have  great   beauty  and\n\necological  value.   To slow  deterioration  of the  environment,\n\nPuerto  Rico   and  the  Corps  signed  a   joint  memorandum  of\n\nunderstanding (the J-Mem) in 1978.  Among other things, execution\n\nof  the  J-Mem  brought  a  screeching  halt  to construction  of\n\nstilthouses along the shore.  \n\n          There are, of course, several ways to skin a  cat   or,\n\nmore to the  point, to provide lodging in  a picturesque setting.\n\nThus,  after  the  moratorium on  new  construction  took effect,\n\nnumerous  houseboats sprouted  in the  bay.   In 1987,  the Corps\n\ninformed the owners of these houseboats that they were subject to\n\n                                2\n\nthe  permitting requirements  of  section  10.    Some  houseboat\n\nowners, including  the  appellants,  applied  for  after-the-fact\n\npermits, but  their applications were  denied.  On June  5, 1990,\n\nthe Corps issued a final order directing all remaining houseboats\n\nto move.1\n\n          As   a  test  case  to  establish  its  authority,  the\n\ngovernment brought suit to enforce  the denial of permits to four\n\nhouseboat owners.  It prevailed below.  See United States v. Seda\n                                                                 \n\nPerez, 825 F. Supp. 447 (D.P.R. 1993).  Two of the four houseboat\n     \n\nowners, Pedro  Monzon and the  estate of Luis  Boothby, prosecute\n\nthis appeal.\n\n                                II\n\n          Section 10 of  the Rivers and Harbors Act,  33 U.S.C.  \n\n403,  outlaws  any unauthorized  \"obstruction\"  to the  navigable\n\ncapacity of the  waters of the United States.2  Its second clause\n\n                    \n\n     1Appellants failed to seek direct  review of this order in a\ntimely fashion.   Yet they  seek review indirectly, for  they are\nresisting the agency's effort to obtain a  determination of legal\nenforceability  by  arguing that  the agency  lacked jurisdiction\nover  their  vessels.     Notwithstanding  this  odd   procedural\nconfiguration, we think  that appellants can assert  their claim.\nAlthough  exhaustion  of  administrative   remedies  is  often  a\nprerequisite  to   judicial  review  of   administrative  action,\njurisdictional  questions are  generally not  waived, because  an\naction taken by an agency lacking jurisdiction is a nullity.  See\n                                                                 \nManual Enterprises v. Day, 370 U.S. 478, 499 n.5 (1962).\n                         \n\n     2The statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n          The   creation   of   any   obstruction   not\n          affirmatively authorized by  Congress, to the\n          navigable  capacity of  any of the  waters of\n          the United States is prohibited; and it shall\n          not  be  lawful  to  build  or  commence  the\n          building of  any wharf, pier,  dolphin, boom,\n          weir, breakwater,  bulkhead, jetty,  or other\n\n                                3\n\ncontains a  long, non-exclusive  enumeration of  things that  are\n\npresumed  to constitute  obstructions.    See  United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nRepublic Steel Corp., 362 U.S. 482, 486-87 (1960); Sierra Club v.\n                                                              \n\nAndrus,  610 F.2d  581, 594-97  (9th Cir.  1979), rev'd  on other\n                                                                 \n\ngrounds, 451 U.S.  287 (1981).  The  statutory list casts a  very\n       \n\nwide net.  Included in this list is the term \"other structures\"  \n\na term  defined in the  Corps' regulations to cover  a \"permanent\n\nmooring structure.\"   33  C.F.R.   322.2(b)  (1993).   We believe\n\nthat this  regulation lawfully can be applied  to houseboats that\n\nare found to constitute permanently moored vessels.  At least two\n\ncourts agree.   See United  States v. Boyden,  696 F.2d  685, 687\n                                            \n\n(9th  Cir. 1983);  United States v.

In  scrutinizing administrative action, a\n\nreviewing court is free to correct errors of law, but, otherwise,\n\nthe  court is  limited to  a search  for arbitrary  or capricious\n\nbehavior.  See  5 U.S.C.   706(2)(A); see also Town of Norfolk v.\n                                                              \n\nU.S. Army  Corps of Engineers,  968 F.2d 1438, 1445-46  (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1992); United States v.

In this search, courts are directed to defer\n\nheavily to  the agency within  the agency's sphere  of expertise.\n\nSee Chevron USA  v. Natural Resources  Defense Council, 467  U.S.\n                                                      \n\n837, 842-45 (1984).\n\n          When, as  now, a  district court,  after itself  taking\n\nevidence,  upholds agency  action, the  hurdle  is higher  still;\n\nfactbound determinations  of the  district  court are  reviewable\n\nonly for  clear  error.   See, e.g.,  Roland M.  v. Concord  Sch.\n                                                                 \n\nComm.,  910 F.2d 983, 990 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n912 (1991).   That  precept has  particular pertinence  here, for\n\nthere is  no doubt that  the salient determinations in  this case\n\nare   fact-intensive.      See  Boyden,   696   F.2d   at  688-89\n                                      \n\n(characterizing the  question of whether  certain houseboats  are\n\n\"permanent mooring structures\" as one of fact); Oak Beach, 744 F.\n                                                         \n\nSupp. at 444 (same).3\n\n                                IV\n\n          Appellants'  depth charges are  aimed, in the  main, at\n\nthe  district court's  finding that  their  houseboats should  be\n\n                    \n\n     3To  be  sure, the  Fifth  Circuit has  suggested  that \"the\nimprecise statutory language of section 10 leaves the  Corps with\nquasi-legal  authority  to  determine what  `effects'  constitute\n           \n`obstructions.'\"  Vieux  Carre Property Owners v. Brown, 875 F.2d\n                                                       \n453, 463 (5th  Cir. 1989) (emphasis supplied),  cert. denied, 493\n                                                            \nU.S. 1020  (1990).  But  this suggestion, even if  carried to its\nlogical extreme, does not militate in favor of a less deferential\nstandard of  review.  While  the key statutory findings  are best\nviewed  as  mixed questions  of  law  and  fact, they  are  fact-\nintensive  and,  therefore, at  least in  this circuit,  they are\nsubject to clear-error review.  See In re  Howard, 996 F.2d 1320,\n                                                 \n1328   (1st  Cir.  1993)  (explaining  that,  if  mixed  fact-law\nquestions  are  fact-dominated,  they are  ordinarily  subject to\nreview under the clearly erroneous standard); Roland M., 910 F.2d\n                                                       \nat 990-91 (similar).  \n\n                                5\n\nconsidered  as stationary structures.   Much of  this bombardment\n\ntargets  the  court's  subsidiary finding  that  the  houseboats'\n\n\"seaworthiness is doubtful,  to say the least.\"   Seda Perez, 825\n                                                            \n\nF. Supp. at  452.  Appellants argue that the Corps' inspector was\n\nnot competent to make an evaluation of navigability, and that the\n\nCorps  itself erred in  allowing environmental factors  and other\n\nimpermissible  considerations to  enter the  decisional calculus.\n\nThey also  argue  that the  record as  a whole  cannot support  a\n\nfinding of doubtful navigability -- stressing that the houseboats\n\nwere  certified as  navigable by  the Puerto  Rico Department  of\n\nNatural Resources  (DNR), that  the houseboats  had acquired  the\n\nrequisite  nautical  accoutrements,   and  that  the   houseboats\n\noccasionally raised anchor and cruised the bay. \n\n          Because  we are in substantial agreement with the lower\n\ncourt and see  no profit in trolling  the same waters, we  do not\n\nwax longiloquent.   In  our view,  three decurtate  observations,\n\nlargely  evocative of the  district court's reasoning,  place the\n\nassigned errors into bold relief and demonstrate that appellants'\n\ndepth charges miss the mark. \n\n          First:  Navigability does not have the same meaning for\n          First:\n               \n\nall  purposes; hence, the DNR's determination of navigability, in\n\na  markedly  different  context,  cannot  be  accorded  decretory\n\nsignificance with regard to  the Corps' permitting process.   The\n\ndistrict court was  free to  consider, and,  ultimately, to  rely\n\nupon, the contrary evidence before it.\n\n          Appellants  contest this point both in the abstract and\n\n                                6\n\nin  the particular.    They  save their  loudest  outcry for  the\n\ndistrict court's acceptance of the opinion testimony offered by a\n\nCorps official  lacking specialized  nautical training.   We  are\n\nunimpressed with this line of  argument.  Under the Federal Rules\n\nof Evidence,  a trial  judge has  broad  latitude in  determining\n\nwhether  a proffered expert  has suitable qualifications  to give\n\nopinion testimony relating  to a given topic.   See United States\n                                                                 \n\nv. Ladd, 885 F.2d 954, 959-60 (1st Cir. 1991); Marshall v.

And,  moreover,  a witness  need not  always\n\npossess  a particular degree or set of educational qualifications\n\nin order to offer opinion testimony.  See, e.g., United States v.\n                                                              \n\nHoffman,  832  F.2d  1299,  1310 (1st  Cir.  1987)  (witness with\n       \n\n\"extensive  practical experience in the field\" allowed to testify\n\nas an expert despite  lack of \"formal schooling\");  Marshall, 828\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at  851 (similar);  Grain Dealers Mut.

Given  this\n                               \n\nflexible  standard,  we  cannot  fault  the  district  court  for\n\nelecting to credit the opinion  of a Corps official familiar with\n\nboth the  Corps' regulations and  the vessels  at issue.   Such a\n\nperson is highly  qualified to testify regarding  the application\n\nof those regulations to those vessels, even if she is not a naval\n\narchitect.  See Boyden, 696 F.2d at 688.\n                      \n\n          It  is also appropriate to note that the district court\n\ndid not embrace this testimony in  a vacuum.  The district  judge\n\n                                7\n\nalso  drew  on  testimony from  a  court-appointed  expert, whose\n\nqualifications  have  not  been  assailed,  as  well  as  on  the\n\nphotographs and other documentary evidence.  We,  ourselves, have\n\nreviewed the administrative record, the trial transcript, and the\n\nexhibits.  Notwithstanding  the DNR certification, we  think that\n\nthe  subsidiary   finding  of  doubtful   navigability  is  amply\n\nsupported, and that  the district court's conclusions  respond to\n\nthe weight  of the  evidence.   Because we  are not  left with  a\n\n\"strong,  unyielding belief that  a mistake has  been committed,\"\n\nCumpiano v.

That, in the abstract, is the enigma posed by this case.  Fortunately, we need not answer it directly.  As a court of law, we leave such metaphysical rumination to the disciples of Jacques Derrida, and address ourselves instead to the more tractable question of whether the Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) properly deemed two particular houseboats to be permanently moored structures within the meaning of section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 U.S.C. Sec. 403 (1988).  The district court ruled that the Corps did not act arbitrarily or capriciously either in subjecting the houseboats to the permitting requirements of section 10 or in refusing to issue permits.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* La Parguera is a bay in Puerto Rico acknowledged by all interested agencies and groups to have great beauty and ecological value.  To slow deterioration of the environment, Puerto Rico and the Corps signed a joint memorandum of understanding (the J-Mem) in 1978.  Among other things, execution of the J-Mem brought a screeching halt to construction of stilthouses along the shore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are, of course, several ways to skin a cat--or, more to the point, to provide lodging in a picturesque setting.  Thus, after the moratorium on new construction took effect, numerous houseboats sprouted in the bay.  In 1987, the Corps informed the owners of these houseboats that they were subject to the permitting requirements of section 10.  Some houseboat owners, including the appellants, applied for after-the-fact permits, but their applications were denied.  On June 5, 1990, the Corps issued a final order directing all remaining houseboats to move.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a test case to establish its authority, the government brought suit to enforce the denial of permits to four houseboat owners.  It prevailed below.  See United States v. Seda Perez, 825 F.Supp. 447 (D.P.R.1993).  Two of the four houseboat owners, Pedro Monzon and the estate of Luis Boothby, prosecute this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 U.S.C. Sec. 403, outlaws any unauthorized \"obstruction\" to the navigable capacity of the waters of the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Its second clause contains a long, non-exclusive enumeration of things that are presumed to constitute obstructions.  See United States v. Republic Steel Corp., 362 U.S. 482, 486-87, 80 S.Ct. 884, 887, 4 L.Ed.2d 903 (1960);  Sierra Club v.

Included in this list is the term \"other structures\"--a term defined in the Corps' regulations to cover a \"permanent mooring structure.\"  33 C.F.R. Sec. 322.2(b) (1993).  We believe that this regulation lawfully can be applied to houseboats that are found to constitute permanently moored vessels.  At least two courts agree.  See United States v. Boyden, 696 F.2d 685, 687 (9th Cir.1983);  United States v. Oak Beach Inn Corp., 744 F.Supp. 439, 444 (S.D.N.Y.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standards of review are stringent, and present high hurdles to parties challenging fact-based decisions of an administrative agency.  In scrutinizing administrative action, a reviewing court is free to correct errors of law, but, otherwise, the court is limited to a search for arbitrary or capricious behavior.  See 5 U.S.C. Sec. 706(2)(A);  see also Town of Norfolk v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 968 F.2d 1438, 1445-46 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Cannons Engineering Corp., 899 F.2d 79, 84 (1st Cir.1990).  In this search, courts are directed to defer heavily to the agency within the agency's sphere of expertise.  See Chevron USA v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842-45, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-83, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as now, a district court, after itself taking evidence, upholds agency action, the hurdle is higher still;  factbound determinations of the district court are reviewable only for clear error.  See, e.g., Roland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm., 910 F.2d 983, 990 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 912, 111 S.Ct. 1122, 113 L.Ed.2d 230 (1991).  That precept has particular pertinence here, for there is no doubt that the salient determinations in this case are fact-intensive.  See Boyden, 696 F.2d at 688-89 (characterizing the question of whether certain houseboats are \"permanent mooring structures\" as one of fact);  Oak Beach, 744 F.Supp. at 444 (same).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' depth charges are aimed, in the main, at the district court's finding that their houseboats should be considered as stationary structures.  Much of this bombardment targets the court's subsidiary finding that the houseboats' \"seaworthiness is doubtful, to say the least.\"  Seda Perez, 825 F.Supp. at 452.   Appellants argue that the Corps' inspector was not competent to make an evaluation of navigability, and that the Corps itself erred in allowing environmental factors and other impermissible considerations to enter the decisional calculus.  They also argue that the record as a whole cannot support a finding of doubtful navigability--stressing that the houseboats were certified as navigable by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources (DNR), that the houseboats had acquired the requisite nautical accoutrements, and that the houseboats occasionally raised anchor and cruised the bay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we are in substantial agreement with the lower court and see no profit in trolling the same waters, we do not wax longiloquent.  In our view, three decurtate observations, largely evocative of the district court's reasoning, place the assigned errors into bold relief and demonstrate that appellants' depth charges miss the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First:  Navigability does not have the same meaning for all purposes;  hence, the DNR's determination of navigability, in a markedly different context, cannot be accorded decretory significance with regard to the Corps' permitting process.  The district court was free to consider, and, ultimately, to rely upon, the contrary evidence before it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contest this point both in the abstract and in the particular.  They save their loudest outcry for the district court's acceptance of the opinion testimony offered by a Corps official lacking specialized nautical training.  We are unimpressed with this line of argument.  Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a trial judge has broad latitude in determining whether a proffered expert has suitable qualifications to give opinion testimony relating to a given topic.  See United States v. Ladd, 885 F.2d 954, 959-60 (1st Cir.1989);  Marshall v. Perez-Arzuaga, 828 F.2d 845, 851 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1065, 108 S.Ct. 1027, 98 L.Ed.2d 991 (1988).  And, moreover, a witness need not always possess a particular degree or set of educational qualifications in order to offer opinion testimony.  See, e.g., United States v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299, 1310 (1st Cir.1987) (witness with \"extensive practical experience in the field\" allowed to testify as an expert despite lack of \"formal schooling\");  Marshall, 828 F.2d at 851 (similar);  Grain Dealers Mut. Ins. Co. v. Farmers Union Coop.  Elevator &amp; Shipping Ass'n, 377 F.2d 672, 679 (10th Cir.1967) (similar); see also Fed.R.Evid. 702.  Given this flexible standard, we cannot fault the district court for electing to credit the opinion of a Corps official familiar with both the Corps' regulations and the vessels at issue.  Such a person is highly qualified to testify regarding the application of those regulations to those vessels, even if she is not a naval architect.  See Boyden, 696 F.2d at 688.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also appropriate to note that the district court did not embrace this testimony in a vacuum.  The district judge also drew on testimony from a court-appointed expert, whose qualifications have not been assailed, as well as on the photographs and other documentary evidence.  We, ourselves, have reviewed the administrative record, the trial transcript, and the exhibits.  Notwithstanding the DNR certification, we think that the subsidiary finding of doubtful navigability is amply supported, and that the district court's conclusions respond to the weight of the evidence.  Because we are not left with a \"strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been committed,\" Cumpiano v. Banco Santander, 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990) (outlining test for clear error), we uphold the finding that the houseboats were of dubious seaworthiness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second:  Appellants berate the district court for considering motive, intent, and environmental factors, rather than limiting its inquiry strictly to capacity to navigate.  But navigability is only one element in the statutory assessment.  Since neither the statute nor the regulations place restrictions on the Corps' discretion to issue permits, see Di Vosta Rental, Inc. v. Lee, 488 F.2d 674, 677 (5th Cir.1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 984, 94 S.Ct. 2387, 40 L.Ed.2d 761 (1974), the agency was fully entitled to take into account other pertinent factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are confident that, under this standard, motive and consequence qualify.  And we hasten to add that the district court's findings as to appellants' motives are solidly rooted in the record.  In sum, the court spotted a pattern of deceit:  the houseboats were put in place to circumvent the ban on stilthouses;  they were primarily intended to serve as vacation homes, pure and simple;  the gadgets attached to them over time were meant to camouflage the scheme rather than for seafaring per se;  and the occasional jaunts about the bay represented perfunctory attempts to satisfy the terms of the statute.  See Seda Perez, 825 F.Supp. at 449 n. 2, 451-52.   Taking these facts as warrantably found by the trier, one can hardly fault agency officials for being concerned more with intent to navigate than with capacity to navigate.  After all, if an owner does not intend to cast off, his or her vessel can be said to be \"permanently moored\" in the relevant sense, notwithstanding the theoretical possibility that the craft is capable of navigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can the agency's attention to the impact of the houseboats on the ecosystem of La Parguera be faulted.

The Court expressly forbade \"a narrow, cramped reading\" of section 10, Republic Steel, 362 U.S. at 491, 80 S.Ct. at 889, because \"[a] river is more than an amenity, it is a treasure,\" id.

See supra p. 21 &amp; n. 2.

Notwithstanding this odd procedural configuration, we think that appellants can assert their claim.  Although exhaustion of administrative remedies is often a prerequisite to judicial review of administrative action, jurisdictional questions are generally not waived, because an action taken by an agency lacking jurisdiction is a nullity.

That, in the abstract, is the enigma posed by this case.  Fortunately, we need not answer it directly.  As a court of law, we leave such metaphysical rumination to the disciples of Jacques Derrida, and address ourselves instead to the more tractable question of whether the Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) properly deemed two particular houseboats to be permanently moored structures within the meaning of section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 U.S.C. Sec. 403 (1988).  The district court ruled that the Corps did not act arbitrarily or capriciously either in subjecting the houseboats to the permitting requirements of section 10 or in refusing to issue permits.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* La Parguera is a bay in Puerto Rico acknowledged by all interested agencies and groups to have great beauty and ecological value.  To slow deterioration of the environment, Puerto Rico and the Corps signed a joint memorandum of understanding (the J-Mem) in 1978.  Among other things, execution of the J-Mem brought a screeching halt to construction of stilthouses along the shore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are, of course, several ways to skin a cat--or, more to the point, to provide lodging in a picturesque setting.  Thus, after the moratorium on new construction took effect, numerous houseboats sprouted in the bay.  In 1987, the Corps informed the owners of these houseboats that they were subject to the permitting requirements of section 10.  Some houseboat owners, including the appellants, applied for after-the-fact permits, but their applications were denied.  On June 5, 1990, the Corps issued a final order directing all remaining houseboats to move.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a test case to establish its authority, the government brought suit to enforce the denial of permits to four houseboat owners.

See Boyden, 696 F.2d at 688-89 (characterizing the question of whether certain houseboats are \"permanent mooring structures\" as one of fact);  Oak Beach, 744 F.Supp. at 444 (same).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' depth charges are aimed, in the main, at the district court's finding that their houseboats should be considered as stationary structures.  Much of this bombardment targets the court's subsidiary finding that the houseboats' \"seaworthiness is doubtful, to say the least.\"  Seda Perez, 825 F.Supp. at 452.   Appellants argue that the Corps' inspector was not competent to make an evaluation of navigability, and that the Corps itself erred in allowing environmental factors and other impermissible considerations to enter the decisional calculus.  They also argue that the record as a whole cannot support a finding of doubtful navigability--stressing that the houseboats were certified as navigable by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources (DNR), that the houseboats had acquired the requisite nautical accoutrements, and that the houseboats occasionally raised anchor and cruised the bay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we are in substantial agreement with the lower court and see no profit in trolling the same waters, we do not wax longiloquent.  In our view, three decurtate observations, largely evocative of the district court's reasoning, place the assigned errors into bold relief and demonstrate that appellants' depth charges miss the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First:  Navigability does not have the same meaning for all purposes;  hence, the DNR's determination of navigability, in a markedly different context, cannot be accorded decretory significance with regard to the Corps' permitting process.  The district court was free to consider, and, ultimately, to rely upon, the contrary evidence before it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contest this point both in the abstract and in the particular.  They save their loudest outcry for the district court's acceptance of the opinion testimony offered by a Corps official lacking specialized nautical training.  We are unimpressed with this line of argument.  Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a trial judge has broad latitude in determining whether a proffered expert has suitable qualifications to give opinion testimony relating to a given topic.  See United States v. Ladd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529712\"><a href=\"/opinion/529712/united-states-v-gary-ladd/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span>, 959-60 (1st Cir.1989);  Marshall v.

And, moreover, a witness need not always possess a particular degree or set of educational qualifications in order to offer opinion testimony.  See, e.g., United States v. Hoffman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496986\"><a href=\"/opinion/496986/united-states-v-barry-hoffman/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1310 (1st Cir.1987) (witness with \"extensive practical experience in the field\" allowed to testify as an expert despite lack of \"formal schooling\");  Marshall, 828 F.2d at 851 (similar);  Grain Dealers Mut.

Given this flexible standard, we cannot fault the district court for electing to credit the opinion of a Corps official familiar with both the Corps' regulations and the vessels at issue.  Such a person is highly qualified to testify regarding the application of those regulations to those vessels, even if she is not a naval architect.  See Boyden, 696 F.2d at 688.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also appropriate to note that the district court did not embrace this testimony in a vacuum.  The district judge also drew on testimony from a court-appointed expert, whose qualifications have not been assailed, as well as on the photographs and other documentary evidence.  We, ourselves, have reviewed the administrative record, the trial transcript, and the exhibits.  Notwithstanding the DNR certification, we think that the subsidiary finding of doubtful navigability is amply supported, and that the district court's conclusions respond to the weight of the evidence.

But navigability is only one element in the statutory assessment.  Since neither the statute nor the regulations place restrictions on the Corps' discretion to issue permits, see Di Vosta Rental, Inc. v. Lee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"315522\"><a href=\"/opinion/315522/di-vosta-rentals-inc-v-emmett-c-lee-jr-colonel-corps-of-engineers/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span>, 677 (5th Cir.1973), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And we hasten to add that the district court's findings as to appellants' motives are solidly rooted in the record.  In sum, the court spotted a pattern of deceit:  the houseboats were put in place to circumvent the ban on stilthouses;  they were primarily intended to serve as vacation homes, pure and simple;  the gadgets attached to them over time were meant to camouflage the scheme rather than for seafaring per se;  and the occasional jaunts about the bay represented perfunctory attempts to satisfy the terms of the statute.  See Seda Perez, 825 F.Supp. at 449 n. 2, 451-52.   Taking these facts as warrantably found by the trier, one can hardly fault agency officials for being concerned more with intent to navigate than with capacity to navigate.  After all, if an owner does not intend to cast off, his or her vessel can be said to be \"permanently moored\" in the relevant sense, notwithstanding the theoretical possibility that the craft is capable of navigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can the agency's attention to the impact of the houseboats on the ecosystem of La Parguera be faulted.  Agency officials understood what appellants evidently do not:  that the Rivers and Harbors Act has been transformed into an instrument of environmental policy.  This transformation occurred long ago.  Indeed, Justice Douglas could hardly have been more plain:  the Act must be read \"charitably,\" with full consideration for the public purposes to be served.

See 33 C.F.R. Sec. 320.4 (1993).  These concerns do no violence to the statutory language.  They are rationally related to the goals of the Act.  Consequently, they may, and should, drive policy.  In arguing to the contrary, appellants' counsel has missed the boat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third:  In any event, the finding that the houseboats constitute \"structures\" is not necessary to the ultimate determination that the houseboats constitute \"obstructions.\"   Section 10's permitting requirements may be triggered by something other than those items enumerated in the second clause of the section, if that \"something\" plausibly can be deemed an obstruction to navigation.  See supra p. 21 &amp; n. 2.  With this in mind, the district court made an alternative, independent finding that the houseboats, regardless of whether they were permanently moored structures, nonetheless obstructed navigation.  See Seda Perez, 825 F.Supp. at 452.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree fully with the district court's legal analysis, and we are unable to say that its underlying finding of fact is clearly erroneous.  Nevertheless, we choose to affirm on the court's primary ground of decision--that the houseboats in this instance constituted structures--rather than explore here the limits of what constitutes an obstruction outside the list of presumptive obstructions contained in the statute itself.  Although we take the Court's lead in construing the Rivers and Harbors Act in spirit with the times, we remain wary of the danger that it might be construed so broadly as to criminalize the dumping of tap water, see Standard Oil, 384 U.S. at 234, 86 S.Ct. at 1432 (Harlan, J., dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Appellants have failed to find a route to safe harbor.  Thus, the order and judgment of the district court enforcing the agency's eviction order must be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Yet they seek review indirectly, for they are resisting the agency's effort to obtain a determination of legal enforceability by arguing that the agency lacked jurisdiction over their vessels.  Notwithstanding this odd procedural configuration, we think that appellants can assert their claim.  Although exhaustion of administrative remedies is often a prerequisite to judicial review of administrative action, jurisdictional questions are generally not waived, because an action taken by an agency lacking jurisdiction is a nullity.

While the key statutory findings are best viewed as mixed questions of law and fact, they are fact-intensive and, therefore, at least in this circuit, they are subject to clear-error review.  See In re Howard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610553\"><a href=\"/opinion/610553/in-re-extradition-of-curtis-andrew-howard-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span>, 1328 (1st Cir.1993) (explaining that, if mixed fact-law questions are fact-dominated, they are ordinarily subject to review under the clearly erroneous standard);  Roland M., 910 F.2d at 990-91 (similar)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Because an appellate court is not obliged to consider arguments presented in a perfunctory manner, see Ryan v.

At any rate, amending the injunction to delete the state-law reference would make no practical difference except in the unlikely event of a major policy shift by the Corps.
