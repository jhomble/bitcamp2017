Appellant also presses a claim under the Sixth Amendment, contending that his trial attorney performed below acceptable standards of proficiency.  We do not think that this contention is ripe for our consideration.  \"We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\"  United States v.

Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 687 (1984)-such claims typically should not be addressed in the first instance by an appellate tribunal.  See Mala,  F.3d at [slip op. at 10];   Costa, 890 F.2d at 483;   Hoyas-Medina, 878 F.2d at 22.  Moreover, because the trial judge is intimately familiar with the case and is \"usually in the best position to assess both the quality of the legal representation afforded to the defendant in the district court and the impact of any shortfall in that representation,\" Mala,  F.3d at [slip op. at 10], his insights are often invaluable in assessing ineffective assistance claims.  For these reasons we have undertaken \"first instance\" review of ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal only when the critical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of the arguments presented.   See, e.g., Natanel, 938 F.2d at 309.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case fits within the general rule, not within the narrow exception to it.  On the record presently compiled, we cannot satisfactorily address either prong of the Strickland inquiry.  In particular, we cannot tell whether counsel's failure to claim \"surprise\" or to seek a voir dire when an in-court identification loomed may (or may not) have served some strategic purpose, or, if not, whether the failure to follow a different course can fairly be regarded as prejudicial in the Strickland sense.  Hence, the issue of ineffective assistance is prematurely before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  We summarily affirm the judgment below, see 1st Cir.  R. 27.1, without prejudice, however, to appellant's right to raise his claim of ineffective assistance in a proceeding brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255.  We express no opinion as to the merit (or lack of merit) of any such claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
