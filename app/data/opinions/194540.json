This case involves a failed\n                              \n\nattempt to license American-made computer software for use in\n\nEurope.   On appeal,  plaintiff The  pH Group  Ltd., formerly\n\nknown   as  Cognetics  Europe  Ltd.  (\"PH\"),  challenges  the\n\ndistrict court's failure (1) to  award it attorneys' fees and\n\n(2) to rule favorably  on its claims of unfair  and deceptive\n\ntrade  practices.   Defendants Cognetics,  Inc. (\"Cognetics\")\n\nand  David  L.  Birch  cross-appeal, taking  issue  with  the\n\ndistrict court's  denial of their motion  for judgment n.o.v.\n\nor  a  new  trial  on  their   counterclaims  for  breach  of\n\ncontract.1    Finding  no   error  in  the  district  court's\n\nrulings, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                   \n\n          David  Birch  developed  computer   software  which\n\nanalyzes Dun &amp; Bradstreet  data bases for business consulting\n\npurposes.2  In order  to exploit this software in  the United\n\nStates, Birch  and his associates  formed Cognetics.   PH was\n\nformed by Rolf Hickmann,  Norbert Reis, and other individuals\n\nprincipally  to  develop  a  consulting  business  in  Europe\n\nthrough  the use of the Cognetics software.  PH and Cognetics\n\n                    \n\n1.  Because  the  interests   of  Birch  and   Cognetics  are\ninexorably   intertwined  for   purposes   of  this   appeal,\nreferences  to Cognetics  should  be  construed  as  applying\nequally to Birch. \n\n2.  Dun  &amp; Bradstreet  generates  computer data  bases  which\nreport the financial statistics of private businesses.  \n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nnegotiated a license agreement (\"the Agreement\"), under which\n\nPH  received the right to use the Cognetics name and software\n\nin Europe.   For its part,  Cognetics was to provide  PH with\n\nboth Dun &amp; Bradstreet's European data bases and the Cognetics\n\nsoftware  to   analyze  them.     The  parties   agreed  that\n\nMassachusetts law would govern the Agreement's construction.\n\n          The Agreement was signed in January of 1987, and PH\n\nbegan doing business in Europe.  Shortly thereafter, the same\n\nindividuals who  had  formed PH  incorporated Maven  Systems,\n\nLtd. (\"Maven\").3  The  record reflects that Maven  was formed\n\nto allow  the individual  owners of PH  to pursue  consulting\n\nbusiness in Europe without using the Cognetics software.  The\n\nAgreement clearly  contemplates and  allows for  such outside\n\nactivity.4  \n\n          Almost   immediately,   difficulties  between   the\n\nparties  surfaced.    Essentially,  PH  claimed  that  Dun  &amp;\n\nBradstreet's European  data bases differed  from its American\n\ndata bases, and that Birch and Cognetics knew, or should have\n\n                    \n\n3.  Maven is not  a party  to this appeal.   Cognetics  named\nMaven  as  a  defendant-in-counterclaim below,  but  does not\nappeal the district  court's ruling that Maven is  not liable\non the counterclaims.  \n\n4.  Section   2(e)   of   the   Agreement,   entitled  \"Other\nBusinesses,\" states:\n\n     [N]othing shall  preclude  [PH] from  conducting  a\n     business unrelated to [Cognetics] Software, Related\n     Software  or  Products .  .  .  provided that  such\n     business is  not  conducted under  the  [Cognetics]\n     Name or any variation thereof.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nknown, that as  a result  of these  differences the  European\n\ndata bases  could not be analyzed  effectively with Cognetics\n\nsoftware.   Cognetics, on the other hand, claimed that PH had\n\nviolated the  Agreement by  improperly allowing Maven  to use\n\nthe Cognetics name in Maven's  initial business dealings.  By\n\nSeptember  1987,   each  party  was  claiming   that  it  had\n\nterminated the Agreement.\n\n          On April 22, 1988,  PH sued Cognetics in diversity,\n\nalleging  common law fraud,  breach of  contract, negligence,\n\nbreach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\n\nbreach of  an implied  warranty of fitness  for a  particular\n\npurpose, and violation of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch.  93A,    2\n\nand 11 (West  1984 and Supp.  1992) (hereinafter referred  to\n\ncollectively  as  \"ch.  93A\"),  which  proscribe  unfair  and\n\ndeceptive trade practices.  PH sought $10 million  in damages\n\non  these claims.  The complaint also asked for a declaratory\n\njudgment that the Agreement's non-competition clause did  not\n\npreclude  PH  from  pursuing  its  now  established  European\n\nconsulting business.5 \n\n          Cognetics   counterclaimed,   alleging  breach   of\n\ncontract,   misappropriation   of   trade   secrets,   unfair\n\n                    \n\n5.  PH  also sought to recover  $30,000, a \"fixed  fee\" to be\npaid  to Cognetics  for  certain services  due  PH under  the\nAgreement.  PH had  placed this money into an  escrow account\nwhen its relations with Cognetics began to sour, and it began\nto question  whether Cognetics would provide  the \"fixed fee\"\nservices.  Cognetics never  contested PH's entitlement to the\n$30,000, and the district court awarded the funds to PH.  \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ncompetition,  violation  of  the  Lanham Trade-Mark  Act,  15\n\nU.S.C.A.   1125(a) (West Supp. 1992), violation of Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws Ann. ch. 110B,   12 (West 1990), which forbids trademark\n\ninfringement, and violation of ch. 93A,   11.  Cognetics also\n\nsought injunctive relief  to prevent further use  of its name\n\nand proprietary materials.   \n\n          The district  court bifurcated the trial  and tried\n\nall liability issues first.  After directing verdicts against\n\nseveral  of  the  parties'  substantive  claims,   the  court\n\nsubmitted  the following claims to the jury:  (1) PH's claims\n\nfor fraud, breach of contract, and breach of implied covenant\n\nof good faith and fair dealing; and (2) Cognetics' claims for\n\nmisappropriation of  trade secrets,  and breach  of contract.\n\nThe  claims and counterclaims under ch. 93A were tried to the\n\ncourt along with the  requests for declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief.\n\n          The jury  found  against PH  on all  of its  claims\n\nexcept for the claim of breach of an implied covenant of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing.   In the subsequent damages  phase of\n\nthe trial,  notwithstanding the  favorable verdict,  the jury\n\nawarded  PH zero  damages  on this  claim.   The  jury  found\n\nagainst Cognetics on all of its counterclaims.  The  district\n\ncourt  found no  violations of  ch. 93A  by either  party and\n\ndenied all  requests for declaratory  and injunctive  relief.\n\nFinally,  the  court denied  Cognetics'  motion for  judgment\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nn.o.v. or new  trial, and denied  PH's motion for  attorneys'\n\nfees.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.  PH's Appeal\n               \n\n     1.  PH's Claim for Attorneys' Fees\n                                       \n\n          PH argues  that it  is entitled to  attorneys' fees\n\nunder  section 21 of the Agreement6 because it \"prevailed\" on\n\nits covenant  of good faith  and fair dealing claim.7   As an\n\ninitial matter, we note that the parties dispute whether this\n\nissue was  properly preserved  for appeal.   Assuming without\n\ndeciding that  the issue was preserved,  we find unpersuasive\n\nPH's contention that it was a \"prevailing party\" below. \n\n                    \n\n6.  Section 21 of the Agreement states: \n\n     Attorneys' Fees.  In any litigation, arbitration or\n                     \n     court   proceeding   between   the   parties,   the\n     prevailing party shall be  entitled to all costs of\n     the   proceedings   incurred   in  enforcing   this\n     Agreement.\n\n7.  At oral argument, PH seemed to argue that the uncontested\naward of  the $30,000  in  escrow entitled  it to  prevailing\nparty status.  This argument, however, appears nowhere in the\ntrial record, nor does it appear in PH's appellate brief.  It\nis  settled in this circuit that issues adverted to on appeal\nin a  perfunctory manner are  deemed to have  been abandoned.\nUnited  States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                         \nAs a result, we need not address this argument.  \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          Courts, both in  Massachusetts and elsewhere,  have\n\nuniformly  required that  a  party succeed  on a  significant\n\nissue in order to be entitled to attorneys' fees.  See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nHandy v. Penal Insts.

See, e.g., Ruiz-Rodriguez  v.

The thrust  of this authority  renders unpersuasive\n\nPH's argument that the  district court erred in finding  that\n\nit  was  not a  \"prevailing party\"  under  section 21  of the\n\nAgreement.\n\n          Moreover, PH has not  proffered any evidence of the\n\nparties' intent in drafting section 21 of the Agreement.  Nor\n\nhas it argued, let  alone demonstrated, that any construction\n\nother than the ordinary  construction of the term \"prevailing\n\nparty\"  should apply.  Accordingly,  we find no  error in the\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\ndistrict court's holding that PH was not a \"prevailing party\"\n\nfor purposes of section 21 of the Agreement.\n\n     2.  PH's ch. 93A Claim \n                           \n\n          PH also  argues that  the  district court's  ruling\n\nthat Cognetics did not  violate ch. 93A is inconsistent  as a\n\nmatter of law with the jury's verdict that Cognetics breached\n\nthe  Agreement's  implied covenant  of  good  faith and  fair\n\ndealing.   Massachusetts  courts have  held, however,  that a\n\ntrial  court's ruling on  a ch. 93A  claim may  differ from a\n\njury's  verdict  on  common  law claims  involving  the  same\n\nevidence.

We must sustain the district court's denial\n\n                    \n\n8.  Although it is not  clear from its briefs, PH  appears to\nargue  that the district court (a) failed to make findings of\nfact sufficient  to support  its  ch. 93A  ruling and/or  (b)\ninappropriately relied upon the jury's finding that Cognetics\ncommitted no fraud.  Having carefully reviewed the record, we\nfind  that the  district court's  factual findings  were both\ncomprehensive and  independent of  the jury's  fraud verdict.\nThus,  PH's   contentions  to  the   contrary  are   entirely\nmeritless.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nof a motion for judgment n.o.v. unless the evidence, together\n\nwith all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, could\n\nlead a reasonable person to only one conclusion, namely, that\n\nthe  moving  party was  entitled  to judgment.

On the other hand, we review\n\ndenial of a motion for new trial under an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard,  with a view  toward whether  \"`the verdict  was so\n\nclearly against the weight of the evidence as  to amount to a\n\nmanifest miscarriage of justice.'\"   Pontarelli v.

Daewoo Corp., 923 F.2d 209, 217 (1st Cir. 1991)). \n                    \n\n          Cognetics  presented   uncontroverted  evidence  at\n\ntrial that the Cognetics name  appeared on two separate Maven\n\nproducts.  On the first occasion, the Cognetics name appeared\n\nin  a Maven slide presentation  at the bottom  of every page.\n\nOn the second  occasion, it  appeared on the  first and  last\n\npages of  a 43-page Maven  presentation.  On  both occasions,\n\nthe Maven products were produced without the use of Cognetics\n\nsoftware.9   Cognetics  argues  that this  evidence can  only\n\n                    \n\n9.  Cognetics  cites  a  third   and  different  use  of  the\nCognetics name in arguing that section 2(b) was breached.  On\nthis  third occasion, PH used the Cognetics name in a product\nproposal, but  the final  product used neither  the Cognetics\nname or software.   We fail  to see how such evidence relates\nto sublicensing.  PH's  use of the Cognetics name  in product\nproposals  is clearly  contemplated by  the Agreement.   More\nimportantly,  this third  example  presents no  evidence that\nMaven, or any other  alleged \"sublicensee,\" actually used the\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nlead  to one  conclusion,  namely, that  PH breached  section\n\n2(b),10  the   Agreement's   sublicensing  provision.      We\n\ndisagree.\n\n          In  determining whether a breach of the Agreement's\n\nsublicensing provision has occurred, we must first define the\n\nterms \"licensing\" and \"sublicensing\" as they are used  in the\n\nAgreement.  We consider the terms \"in light of all the  other\n\nphraseology  in  the  instrument,\"   and  \"in  light  of  the\n\ncircumstances of the transaction.\"  McDonald's Corp. v. Lebow\n                                                             \n\nRealty Trust, 888 F.2d 912, 913-14 (1st Cir. 1989) (citations\n            \n\nomitted).  \n\n                    \n\nCognetics name or software.   PH's use of the  Cognetics name\nin  this  situation might  support a  claim that  PH breached\nsection 11(e) of the Agreement, which states that  neither PH\nnor  its affiliates  may market  products which  compete with\nCognetics products. However, this  evidence does not  support\nCognetics'  claim that PH  improperly sublicensed  its rights\nunder the Agreement.\n\n10.  Section 2(b) provides:\n\n     Sublicense  Right.   Cognetics  grants to  [PH] the\n     right to sublicense its  rights under Section  2(a)\n     to  an entity or entities which are wholly owned by\n     [PH],  provided however,  that  (i)  [PH]  notifies\n     Cognetics in advance and in writing with respect to\n     such  sub-license, (ii)  the foregoing  right shall\n     not  relieve [PH]  from its  obligations hereunder,\n     and (iii)  such sub-licensee  is subject to  all of\n     the   terms  and  conditions   of  this  Agreement.\n     Cognetics  may, in  advance  of  such  sub-license,\n     require  any reasonable  documentation of  [PH] and\n     its sub-licensee in order to  assure sub-licensee's\n     agreement to the foregoing.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n          As  we  read  section  2(a)11   of  the  Agreement,\n\nlicensing  consists of three elements:  (1) an agreement; (2)\n\nwhich  permits the  licensee  to use  the  Cognetics name  in\n\ntandem  with  the  Cognetics  software;  (3)  in  an  ongoing\n\ncommercial manner.  These  three characteristics ensure  that\n\nPH, the licensee, can  establish a viable consulting business\n\nin Europe through the use of the Cognetics name and software.\n\n          Section  2(b),  in turn,  grants  PH  the right  to\n\n\"sublicense\" its  rights under the Agreement  to wholly owned\n\nthird  parties.    Sublicensing  under  2(b)  is  similar  to\n\nlicensing under 2(a).  It consists of:  (1) an agreement; (2)\n\nwhereby  PH  grants  a  third  party  permission  to  use the\n\nCognetics name in tandem with the Cognetics software; (3) for\n\nongoing commercial purposes.  \n\n                    \n\n11.  Section 2(a) provides:\n\n     Software and Name License.  Cognetics hereby grants\n                              \n     to Licensee the  exclusive, non-transferable  right\n     and license without right  of sublicense, except as\n     specifically  provided  in  subsection (b)  hereof,\n     (the \"License\"), to (i) use the Object Code version\n     of  the   [Cognetics]  Software  and   any  Related\n     Software,   including  but   not  limited   to  any\n     Improvements, and all Software  Documentation, (ii)\n     use and  to commercialize the  Name, including  but\n     not limited  to  as part  of the  Name under  which\n     Licensee  does business  in  the  European  Market,\n     provided, however,  that use  of the Name  shall be\n     solely in respect of [Cognetics] Products and (iii)\n     use,  market, sell  and otherwise  to commercialize\n     the  Products,  provided   however,  that  all  the\n     foregoing  is granted throughout  but solely within\n     the European Market. \n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\n          In  order  to  prove  a  breach  of  section  2(b),\n\nCognetics  would first have  to establish the  existence of a\n\nsublicensing agreement between PH and Maven.  Cognetics would\n\nthen have to  show that the  sublicensing was improper  under\n\nsection  2(b)  or  some  other provision  of  the  Agreement.\n\nCognetics  has failed to allege or  demonstrate that any such\n\nsublicensing occurred.\n\n          Both  at trial  and on  appeal, Cognetics  seems to\n\nrely  on  the  mistaken assumption  that  any  misuse  of the\n\nCognetics  name  by  Maven  or  PH,  whether  intentional  or\n\ninadvertent, conclusively  demonstrates improper sublicensing\n\nin breach  of section 2(b) on  the part of PH.   However, not\n\nall misuses  of the  Cognetics name by  non-sublicensed third\n\nparties amount to breaches of  section 2(b).  General misuses\n\nof  the Cognetics name may be actionable under several of the\n\nAgreement's  provisions.12   However, in  order to  give rise\n\nto a claim under section 2(b), the  misuse must take place in\n\nthe context of an improper sublicensing agreement. \n\n          At  trial, PH's  principals testified  that Maven's\n\nmisuse  was  essentially  inadvertent.    For  example,  Rolf\n\n                    \n\n12.  For  example, section  6(c) states  that PH  acquires no\nproprietary interest in the Cognetics name; section 11 states\nthat both  parties agree  to preserve the  confidentiality of\nproprietary material;  section 14 states that  PH will notify\nCognetics  of any  infringements  of the  Agreement by  third\nparties; and section  16 states  that PH may  not assign  its\nrights or  obligations under the  contract without Cognetics'\nconsent.   \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nHickmann, a principal  of both PH  and Maven, testified  that\n\nthe use of  the Cognetics name in Maven's  slide presentation\n\nwas \"careless,\" and  that, between them, PH  and Maven \"could\n\nonly  afford  one  set  of stationery  for  slide  material.\"\n\nCognetics  offered no  contrary  evidence  showing  that  the\n\nmisuses of the Cognetics name were in fact due to an improper\n\nsublicensing agreement.\n\n          At best, Cognetics has demonstrated  that PH and/or\n\nMaven misused  the Cognetics name on two occasions.  Standing\n\nalone,  this evidence  of misuse  does not  conclusively show\n\nthat PH improperly  sublicensed its rights to Maven,  or that\n\nPH breached section 2(b) of the Agreement.  Thus, contrary to\n\nCognetics' claim in its  post-trial motion, the evidence does\n\nnot  lead inexorably  to  the conclusion  that PH  improperly\n\nsublicensed  its rights to Maven in breach of section 2(b) of\n\nthe  Agreement.  A reasonable  jury could have concluded that\n\nMaven's  misuse of the  Cognetics name  was inadvertent.   In\n\nfact, we find  no evidence in the record  which would allow a\n\njury to conclude otherwise.   Accordingly, the district court\n\nproperly denied Cognetics' motion for judgment n.o.v.  \n\n          By  the  same token,  the  verdict  is not  clearly\n\nagainst the  weight of the evidence and  presents no manifest\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nmiscarriage of  justice.  Thus, the  district court committed\n\nno error in denying Cognetics' motion for new trial.13\n\n          For  the foregoing  reasons,  the judgment  of  the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n                          \n\n                    \n\n13.  Cognetics   also   challenges   the   district   court's\ninstructions to the jury on section 2(b).  The district court\ninstructed the jury that  only \"material\" breaches of section\n2(b)  give  rise  to  a right  to  terminate  the  Agreement.\nCognetics  argues  that  under  the  Agreement,  non-material\nbreaches  of  section  2(b) also  give  rise  to  a right  to\nterminate,  and  that  the  district court's  failure  to  so\ninstruct entitles it to judgment n.o.v. or a new trial.\n     We assume without deciding that non-material breaches of\nsection 2(b) give rise to a right to terminate.  Nonetheless,\nas we  have  noted  above,  Cognetics  failed  to  allege  or\ndemonstrate a breach of  section 2(b), material or otherwise.\nThus,  even if  the district  court's instruction  on section\n2(b) was incorrect, the evidence does not necessarily lead to\nthe conclusion  that a non-material breach  of 2(b) occurred.\nNor can we say  that the verdict was  so clearly against  the\nweight of the evidence as to amount to a manifest miscarriage\nof justice.  Accordingly, Cognetics' argument  regarding jury\ninstructions  does  not  alter  our  determination  that  the\ndistrict court properly denied Cognetics' motion for judgment\nn.o.v. or new trial.\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n",

On appeal,  plaintiff The  pH Group  Ltd., formerly\n\nknown   as  Cognetics  Europe  Ltd.  (\"PH\"),  challenges  the\n\ndistrict court's failure (1) to  award it attorneys' fees and\n\n(2) to rule favorably  on its claims of unfair  and deceptive\n\ntrade  practices.   Defendants Cognetics,  Inc. (\"Cognetics\")\n\nand  David  L.  Birch  cross-appeal, taking  issue  with  the\n\ndistrict court's  denial of their motion  for judgment n.o.v.\n\nor  a  new  trial  on  their   counterclaims  for  breach  of\n\ncontract.1    Finding  no   error  in  the  district  court's\n\nrulings, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                   \n\n          David  Birch  developed  computer   software  which\n\nanalyzes Dun &amp; Bradstreet  data bases for business consulting\n\npurposes.2  In order  to exploit this software in  the United\n\nStates, Birch  and his associates  formed Cognetics.   PH was\n\nformed by Rolf Hickmann,  Norbert Reis, and other individuals\n\nprincipally  to  develop  a  consulting  business  in  Europe\n\nthrough  the use of the Cognetics software.  PH and Cognetics\n\n                    \n\n1.  Because  the  interests   of  Birch  and   Cognetics  are\ninexorably   intertwined  for   purposes   of  this   appeal,\nreferences  to Cognetics  should  be  construed  as  applying\nequally to Birch. \n\n2.  Dun  &amp; Bradstreet  generates  computer data  bases  which\nreport the financial statistics of private businesses.  \n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nnegotiated a license agreement (\"the Agreement\"), under which\n\nPH  received the right to use the Cognetics name and software\n\nin Europe.   For its part,  Cognetics was to provide  PH with\n\nboth Dun &amp; Bradstreet's European data bases and the Cognetics\n\nsoftware  to   analyze  them.     The  parties   agreed  that\n\nMassachusetts law would govern the Agreement's construction.\n\n          The Agreement was signed in January of 1987, and PH\n\nbegan doing business in Europe.  Shortly thereafter, the same\n\nindividuals who  had  formed PH  incorporated Maven  Systems,\n\nLtd. (\"Maven\").3  The  record reflects that Maven  was formed\n\nto allow  the individual  owners of PH  to pursue  consulting\n\nbusiness in Europe without using the Cognetics software.  The\n\nAgreement clearly  contemplates and  allows for  such outside\n\nactivity.4  \n\n          Almost   immediately,   difficulties  between   the\n\nparties  surfaced.    Essentially,  PH  claimed  that  Dun  &amp;\n\nBradstreet's European  data bases differed  from its American\n\ndata bases, and that Birch and Cognetics knew, or should have\n\n                    \n\n3.  Maven is not  a party  to this appeal.   Cognetics  named\nMaven  as  a  defendant-in-counterclaim below,  but  does not\nappeal the district  court's ruling that Maven is  not liable\non the counterclaims.  \n\n4.  Section   2(e)   of   the   Agreement,   entitled  \"Other\nBusinesses,\" states:\n\n     [N]othing shall  preclude  [PH] from  conducting  a\n     business unrelated to [Cognetics] Software, Related\n     Software  or  Products .  .  .  provided that  such\n     business is  not  conducted under  the  [Cognetics]\n     Name or any variation thereof.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nknown, that as  a result  of these  differences the  European\n\ndata bases  could not be analyzed  effectively with Cognetics\n\nsoftware.   Cognetics, on the other hand, claimed that PH had\n\nviolated the  Agreement by  improperly allowing Maven  to use\n\nthe Cognetics name in Maven's  initial business dealings.  By\n\nSeptember  1987,   each  party  was  claiming   that  it  had\n\nterminated the Agreement.\n\n          On April 22, 1988,  PH sued Cognetics in diversity,\n\nalleging  common law fraud,  breach of  contract, negligence,\n\nbreach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\n\nbreach of  an implied  warranty of fitness  for a  particular\n\npurpose, and violation of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch.  93A,    2\n\nand 11 (West  1984 and Supp.  1992) (hereinafter referred  to\n\ncollectively  as  \"ch.  93A\"),  which  proscribe  unfair  and\n\ndeceptive trade practices.  PH sought $10 million  in damages\n\non  these claims.  The complaint also asked for a declaratory\n\njudgment that the Agreement's non-competition clause did  not\n\npreclude  PH  from  pursuing  its  now  established  European\n\nconsulting business.5 \n\n          Cognetics   counterclaimed,   alleging  breach   of\n\ncontract,   misappropriation   of   trade   secrets,   unfair\n\n                    \n\n5.  PH  also sought to recover  $30,000, a \"fixed  fee\" to be\npaid  to Cognetics  for  certain services  due  PH under  the\nAgreement.  PH had  placed this money into an  escrow account\nwhen its relations with Cognetics began to sour, and it began\nto question  whether Cognetics would provide  the \"fixed fee\"\nservices.  Cognetics never  contested PH's entitlement to the\n$30,000, and the district court awarded the funds to PH.  \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ncompetition,  violation  of  the  Lanham Trade-Mark  Act,  15\n\nU.S.C.A.   1125(a) (West Supp. 1992), violation of Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws Ann. ch. 110B,   12 (West 1990), which forbids trademark\n\ninfringement, and violation of ch. 93A,   11.  Cognetics also\n\nsought injunctive relief  to prevent further use  of its name\n\nand proprietary materials.   \n\n          The district  court bifurcated the trial  and tried\n\nall liability issues first.  After directing verdicts against\n\nseveral  of  the  parties'  substantive  claims,   the  court\n\nsubmitted  the following claims to the jury:  (1) PH's claims\n\nfor fraud, breach of contract, and breach of implied covenant\n\nof good faith and fair dealing; and (2) Cognetics' claims for\n\nmisappropriation of  trade secrets,  and breach  of contract.\n\nThe  claims and counterclaims under ch. 93A were tried to the\n\ncourt along with the  requests for declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief.\n\n          The jury  found  against PH  on all  of its  claims\n\nexcept for the claim of breach of an implied covenant of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing.   In the subsequent damages  phase of\n\nthe trial,  notwithstanding the  favorable verdict,  the jury\n\nawarded  PH zero  damages  on this  claim.   The  jury  found\n\nagainst Cognetics on all of its counterclaims.  The  district\n\ncourt  found no  violations of  ch. 93A  by either  party and\n\ndenied all  requests for declaratory  and injunctive  relief.\n\nFinally,  the  court denied  Cognetics'  motion for  judgment\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nn.o.v. or new  trial, and denied  PH's motion for  attorneys'\n\nfees.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\nA.  PH's Appeal\n               \n\n     1.  PH's Claim for Attorneys' Fees\n                                       \n\n          PH argues  that it  is entitled to  attorneys' fees\n\nunder  section 21 of the Agreement6 because it \"prevailed\" on\n\nits covenant  of good faith  and fair dealing claim.7   As an\n\ninitial matter, we note that the parties dispute whether this\n\nissue was  properly preserved  for appeal.   Assuming without\n\ndeciding that  the issue was preserved,  we find unpersuasive\n\nPH's contention that it was a \"prevailing party\" below. \n\n                    \n\n6.  Section 21 of the Agreement states: \n\n     Attorneys' Fees.  In any litigation, arbitration or\n                     \n     court   proceeding   between   the   parties,   the\n     prevailing party shall be  entitled to all costs of\n     the   proceedings   incurred   in  enforcing   this\n     Agreement.\n\n7.  At oral argument, PH seemed to argue that the uncontested\naward of  the $30,000  in  escrow entitled  it to  prevailing\nparty status.  This argument, however, appears nowhere in the\ntrial record, nor does it appear in PH's appellate brief.  It\nis  settled in this circuit that issues adverted to on appeal\nin a  perfunctory manner are  deemed to have  been abandoned.\nUnited  States v.

The thrust  of this authority  renders unpersuasive\n\nPH's argument that the  district court erred in finding  that\n\nit  was  not a  \"prevailing party\"  under  section 21  of the\n\nAgreement.\n\n          Moreover, PH has not  proffered any evidence of the\n\nparties' intent in drafting section 21 of the Agreement.

On the first occasion, the Cognetics name appeared\n\nin  a Maven slide presentation  at the bottom  of every page.\n\nOn the second  occasion, it  appeared on the  first and  last\n\npages of  a 43-page Maven  presentation.  On  both occasions,\n\nthe Maven products were produced without the use of Cognetics\n\nsoftware.9   Cognetics  argues  that this  evidence can  only\n\n                    \n\n9.  Cognetics  cites  a  third   and  different  use  of  the\nCognetics name in arguing that section 2(b) was breached.  On\nthis  third occasion, PH used the Cognetics name in a product\nproposal, but  the final  product used neither  the Cognetics\nname or software.   We fail  to see how such evidence relates\nto sublicensing.  PH's  use of the Cognetics name  in product\nproposals  is clearly  contemplated by  the Agreement.   More\nimportantly,  this third  example  presents no  evidence that\nMaven, or any other  alleged \"sublicensee,\" actually used the\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nlead  to one  conclusion,  namely, that  PH breached  section\n\n2(b),10  the   Agreement's   sublicensing  provision.      We\n\ndisagree.\n\n          In  determining whether a breach of the Agreement's\n\nsublicensing provision has occurred, we must first define the\n\nterms \"licensing\" and \"sublicensing\" as they are used  in the\n\nAgreement.  We consider the terms \"in light of all the  other\n\nphraseology  in  the  instrument,\"   and  \"in  light  of  the\n\ncircumstances of the transaction.\"  McDonald's Corp. v.

PH's use of the  Cognetics name\nin  this  situation might  support a  claim that  PH breached\nsection 11(e) of the Agreement, which states that  neither PH\nnor  its affiliates  may market  products which  compete with\nCognetics products. However, this  evidence does not  support\nCognetics'  claim that PH  improperly sublicensed  its rights\nunder the Agreement.\n\n10.  Section 2(b) provides:\n\n     Sublicense  Right.   Cognetics  grants to  [PH] the\n     right to sublicense its  rights under Section  2(a)\n     to  an entity or entities which are wholly owned by\n     [PH],  provided however,  that  (i)  [PH]  notifies\n     Cognetics in advance and in writing with respect to\n     such  sub-license, (ii)  the foregoing  right shall\n     not  relieve [PH]  from its  obligations hereunder,\n     and (iii)  such sub-licensee  is subject to  all of\n     the   terms  and  conditions   of  this  Agreement.\n     Cognetics  may, in  advance  of  such  sub-license,\n     require  any reasonable  documentation of  [PH] and\n     its sub-licensee in order to  assure sub-licensee's\n     agreement to the foregoing.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n          As  we  read  section  2(a)11   of  the  Agreement,\n\nlicensing  consists of three elements:  (1) an agreement; (2)\n\nwhich  permits the  licensee  to use  the  Cognetics name  in\n\ntandem  with  the  Cognetics  software;  (3)  in  an  ongoing\n\ncommercial manner.  These  three characteristics ensure  that\n\nPH, the licensee, can  establish a viable consulting business\n\nin Europe through the use of the Cognetics name and software.\n\n          Section  2(b),  in turn,  grants  PH  the right  to\n\n\"sublicense\" its  rights under the Agreement  to wholly owned\n\nthird  parties.    Sublicensing  under  2(b)  is  similar  to\n\nlicensing under 2(a).  It consists of:  (1) an agreement; (2)\n\nwhereby  PH  grants  a  third  party  permission  to  use the\n\nCognetics name in tandem with the Cognetics software; (3) for\n\nongoing commercial purposes.  \n\n                    \n\n11.  Section 2(a) provides:\n\n     Software and Name License.  Cognetics hereby grants\n                              \n     to Licensee the  exclusive, non-transferable  right\n     and license without right  of sublicense, except as\n     specifically  provided  in  subsection (b)  hereof,\n     (the \"License\"), to (i) use the Object Code version\n     of  the   [Cognetics]  Software  and   any  Related\n     Software,   including  but   not  limited   to  any\n     Improvements, and all Software  Documentation, (ii)\n     use and  to commercialize the  Name, including  but\n     not limited  to  as part  of the  Name under  which\n     Licensee  does business  in  the  European  Market,\n     provided, however,  that use  of the Name  shall be\n     solely in respect of [Cognetics] Products and (iii)\n     use,  market, sell  and otherwise  to commercialize\n     the  Products,  provided   however,  that  all  the\n     foregoing  is granted throughout  but solely within\n     the European Market. \n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\n          In  order  to  prove  a  breach  of  section  2(b),\n\nCognetics  would first have  to establish the  existence of a\n\nsublicensing agreement between PH and Maven.  Cognetics would\n\nthen have to  show that the  sublicensing was improper  under\n\nsection  2(b)  or  some  other provision  of  the  Agreement.\n\nCognetics  has failed to allege or  demonstrate that any such\n\nsublicensing occurred.\n\n          Both  at trial  and on  appeal, Cognetics  seems to\n\nrely  on  the  mistaken assumption  that  any  misuse  of the\n\nCognetics  name  by  Maven  or  PH,  whether  intentional  or\n\ninadvertent, conclusively  demonstrates improper sublicensing\n\nin breach  of section 2(b) on  the part of PH.   However, not\n\nall misuses  of the  Cognetics name by  non-sublicensed third\n\nparties amount to breaches of  section 2(b).  General misuses\n\nof  the Cognetics name may be actionable under several of the\n\nAgreement's  provisions.12   However, in  order to  give rise\n\nto a claim under section 2(b), the  misuse must take place in\n\nthe context of an improper sublicensing agreement. \n\n          At  trial, PH's  principals testified  that Maven's\n\nmisuse  was  essentially  inadvertent.    For  example,  Rolf\n\n                    \n\n12.  For  example, section  6(c) states  that PH  acquires no\nproprietary interest in the Cognetics name; section 11 states\nthat both  parties agree  to preserve the  confidentiality of\nproprietary material;  section 14 states that  PH will notify\nCognetics  of any  infringements  of the  Agreement by  third\nparties; and section  16 states  that PH may  not assign  its\nrights or  obligations under the  contract without Cognetics'\nconsent.   \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nHickmann, a principal  of both PH  and Maven, testified  that\n\nthe use of  the Cognetics name in Maven's  slide presentation\n\nwas \"careless,\" and  that, between them, PH  and Maven \"could\n\nonly  afford  one  set  of stationery  for  slide  material.\"\n\nCognetics  offered no  contrary  evidence  showing  that  the\n\nmisuses of the Cognetics name were in fact due to an improper\n\nsublicensing agreement.\n\n          At best, Cognetics has demonstrated  that PH and/or\n\nMaven misused  the Cognetics name on two occasions.  Standing\n\nalone,  this evidence  of misuse  does not  conclusively show\n\nthat PH improperly  sublicensed its rights to Maven,  or that\n\nPH breached section 2(b) of the Agreement.  Thus, contrary to\n\nCognetics' claim in its  post-trial motion, the evidence does\n\nnot  lead inexorably  to  the conclusion  that PH  improperly\n\nsublicensed  its rights to Maven in breach of section 2(b) of\n\nthe  Agreement.  A reasonable  jury could have concluded that\n\nMaven's  misuse of the  Cognetics name  was inadvertent.   In\n\nfact, we find  no evidence in the record  which would allow a\n\njury to conclude otherwise.   Accordingly, the district court\n\nproperly denied Cognetics' motion for judgment n.o.v.  \n\n          By  the  same token,  the  verdict  is not  clearly\n\nagainst the  weight of the evidence and  presents no manifest\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nmiscarriage of  justice.  Thus, the  district court committed\n\nno error in denying Cognetics' motion for new trial.13\n\n          For  the foregoing  reasons,  the judgment  of  the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n                          \n\n                    \n\n13.  Cognetics   also   challenges   the   district   court's\ninstructions to the jury on section 2(b).  The district court\ninstructed the jury that  only \"material\" breaches of section\n2(b)  give  rise  to  a right  to  terminate  the  Agreement.\nCognetics  argues  that  under  the  Agreement,  non-material\nbreaches  of  section  2(b) also  give  rise  to  a right  to\nterminate,  and  that  the  district court's  failure  to  so\ninstruct entitles it to judgment n.o.v. or a new trial.\n     We assume without deciding that non-material breaches of\nsection 2(b) give rise to a right to terminate.  Nonetheless,\nas we  have  noted  above,  Cognetics  failed  to  allege  or\ndemonstrate a breach of  section 2(b), material or otherwise.\nThus,  even if  the district  court's instruction  on section\n2(b) was incorrect, the evidence does not necessarily lead to\nthe conclusion  that a non-material breach  of 2(b) occurred.\nNor can we say  that the verdict was  so clearly against  the\nweight of the evidence as to amount to a manifest miscarriage\nof justice.  Accordingly, Cognetics' argument  regarding jury\ninstructions  does  not  alter  our  determination  that  the\ndistrict court properly denied Cognetics' motion for judgment\nn.o.v. or new trial.\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n</pre>",
