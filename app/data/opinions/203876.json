Luis Caldero-Guzman (\"Caldero\"),\n\na national of El Salvador, petitions for judicial review of the\n\nBoard   of   Immigration   Appeals'    (\"BIA\")   decision   affirming   an\n\nImmigration Judge's (\"IJ\") denial of his motion to reopen his\n\ndeportation proceedings after an in absentia deportation order was\n\nentered against him in 1989.          Caldero had hoped to reopen the\n\nproceedings so as to adjudicate his application for cancellation of\n\nremoval under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief\n\nAct (\"NACARA\"), Pub. L. No. 105-100, § 203, 111 Stat. 2160, 2196\n\n(1997), set forth at 8 U.S.C. § 1101 note.         Lacking jurisdiction\n\nover one of Caldero's claims, and finding no error of law or abuse\n\nof discretion in the BIA's disposition of this matter, we dismiss\n\nthe petition in part, and deny it as to the rest.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n             In 1988, Caldero entered the United States, was detained\n\nby the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\"), and\n\nwas placed into deportation proceedings for having entered the\n\nUnited States without inspection.        In April 1989, proceeding pro\n\nse, Caldero attended an Immigration Court hearing and was granted\n\na continuance, his second, to allow him additional time to obtain\n\ncounsel; his hearing was reset for July, 1989, and the record\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\freflects   that   he    was   advised      of   the   new       date.1     Before   the\n\ncontinuance   was      granted,    Caldero      signed      a    written    statement\n\nattesting, \"If a continuance is granted, I will follow the order of\n\nthe Court and appear on the appointed date, just as I have appeared\n\ntoday for this hearing.\"          On the appointed date in July, however,\n\nCaldero did not appear, and after finding that the INS had proved\n\nhis deportability (now called removability) by \"clear, convincing,\n\nand   unequivocal\"     evidence,     the    Immigration          Judge   ordered    him\n\ndeported in absentia.         The record reflects that the deportation\n\norder was served on Caldero by mail at his last known address,\n\nwhich Caldero himself had supplied at a prior hearing.2\n\n           In 2003, Caldero filed for relief under NACARA.3                         In\n\n2004, during an interview with the Department of Homeland Security\n\n(\"DHS\"), Caldero was advised that because he had an outstanding\n\ndeportation order against him and had missed NACARA's September 11,\n\n1998 deadline for untimely motions to reopen for purposes of\n\n\n\n      1\n      This hearing was not transcribed, but the in absentia\ndeportation order notes that \"[t]he respondent was duly notified of\nthe time and place of the hearing,\" and Caldero has not challenged\nthe fact that he was advised of the new hearing date.\n      2\n      The record evidence contains neither affirmative proof that\nCaldero received the mailing nor an indication that the mail was\nreturned to the sender. We note, however, that there is no genuine\ndispute as to whether a copy of the deportation order was mailed to\nCaldero at his last known address; Caldero's contention, discussed\nbelow, is simply that he was unaware of the outstanding order.\n      3\n      We assume arguendo for purposes of this review that Caldero\nis eligible for the relief he seeks under NACARA.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fobtaining a cancellation of removal, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.43(e)(1),\n\nhe could not apply for NACARA relief.\n\n           In 2006, Caldero filed the instant motion to reopen the\n\ndeportation proceedings against him, arguing that he was never\n\nprovided notice of the in absentia deportation order, and therefore\n\nhe could not have known that the 1998 deadline applied to him.        The\n\nmotion further argued that his \"serious physical and mental health\n\nissues,\" namely, the debilitating effects of the AIDS and Kaposi's\n\nSarcoma diseases with which he has been afflicted since 1995,\n\n\"require   his   presence   in   the    United   States   for   continued\n\ntreatment,\" and that his health will deteriorate due to lack of\n\nappropriate medical care if he is returned to El Salvador.            The\n\nmotion, however, omitted any explanation for his failure to attend\n\nthe July 1989 deportation hearing.\n\n           The IJ denied Caldero's motion in a written decision.\n\nThe IJ first found that the outstanding deportation order was\n\nvalid, noting that Caldero had \"received adequate notice of his\n\ndeportation hearing and nonetheless failed to appear,\" and that\n\nCaldero had provided no adequate excuse for the failure.          The IJ\n\nemphasized that Caldero's health problems, which began in 1995, and\n\nhis concerns about the difficulties he will encounter if deported\n\nwere both irrelevant to the legitimacy of the deportation order\n\nentered against him or to whether he had adequate notice of it.\n\nThe IJ then found that Caldero \"cannot claim that ignorance of his\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fdeportation order excuses a delay of over seventeen years,\" since\n\nCaldero was put on notice by the 1988 Order to Show Cause that\n\n\"[f]ailure    to   attend   the     hearing    .    .   .   may   result   in   a\n\ndetermination being made by the Immigration Judge in your absence,\"\n\nwas advised of the date and time for his July 1989 hearing, and was\n\ninformed of the deportation order against him by mail.                 Finally,\n\nthe   IJ   found   that   Caldero   could     not   reopen    his   deportation\n\nproceedings    pursuant     to    NACARA.          Characterizing     Caldero's\n\napplication under NACARA as seeking cancellation of removal, not\n\nthe adjudication of an asylum claim, the IJ found that Caldero had\n\nfailed to comply with the September 11, 1998 deadline to file a\n\nmotion to reopen for adjudication of a cancellation of removal\n\nclaim.     And to the extent that Caldero sought to reopen his\n\ndeportation order for the consideration of an asylum claim, the IJ\n\nnoted that Caldero had failed to show the requisite change in\n\ncountry conditions.\n\n            The BIA dismissed Caldero's appeal in a separate written\n\ndecision. As to the validity of the in absentia deportation order,\n\nthe BIA acknowledged that \"lack of notice may constitute reasonable\n\ncause for missing a hearing,\" but found that because Caldero knew\n\nof the July 1989 hearing, signed the written statement agreeing to\n\nappear, and failed to allege that he lacked notice of the hearing,\n\nhe had not shown lack of notice nor any other reasonable cause for\n\nfailing to appear at his hearing.             In a footnote, the BIA noted\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthat any application made for cancellation of removal pursuant to\n\nNACARA was untimely because the motion to reopen was made after\n\nNACARA's September 11, 1998 deadline.   Finally, the BIA rejected\n\nCaldero's request to reopen his deportation order on its own\n\nmotion, stating, \"[W]e do not find that the circumstances of this\n\ncase warrant the exercise of our limited discretion to reopen sua\n\nsponte.\"\n\nII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n           Because the BIA independently evaluated the record and\n\nreached its own legal conclusions, we focus our review on the\n\ndecision of the BIA as opposed to that of the IJ.        Pulisir v.\n\nMukasey, 524 F.3d 302, 307-08 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           \"We review the BIA's denial of the motion to reopen for\n\nabuse of discretion, setting aside a decision only where it rests\n\non an error of law or reflects arbitrary or capricious decision-\n\nmaking.\"   Oliveira v. Holder, ___ F.3d ___, No.08-2494, 2009 WL\n\n1547742, *1 (1st Cir. June 4, 2009) (citing Arias-Valencia v.\n\nMukasey, 529 F.3d 428, 430 (1st Cir. 2008); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a))\n\n(footnote omitted); see also Guerrero-Santana v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d\n\n90, 92 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"Motions to reopen removal proceedings are\n\ndisfavored as contrary to 'the compelling public interests in\n\nfinality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.'\" (quoting\n\nRaza v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (1st Cir. 2007))).\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fIII.    DISCUSSION\n\n               Caldero mounts three challenges to the BIA's decision,\n\nnone of them persuasive.          First, he argues that the BIA erred in\n\nfailing to reopen his case sua sponte, both because the IJ failed\n\nto    analyze    Caldero's     allegedly      exceptional       circumstances,      and\n\nbecause those circumstances warrant reopening.                    We disagree with\n\nCaldero's premise that the IJ failed to consider the circumstances\n\nhe adverts to, namely, his health problems, his alleged lack of\n\nnotice    of     the   deportation        order,   and    the     difficulties       he\n\nanticipates were he deported to El Salvador; these issues were\n\nexplicitly addressed in the IJ's order.                     But whether the IJ\n\naddressed Caldero's circumstances is beside the point, for our\n\ncircuit precedent makes clear that we lack jurisdiction to review\n\nthe    BIA's    refusal   to   reopen     a   deportation       order   sua   sponte.\n\nPeralta v. Holder, ___ F.3d ___, No. 08-2073, 2009 WL 1475557, at\n\n*3 (1st Cir. May 28, 2009); Luis, 196 F.3d at 40.\n\n               Caldero's second argument, no more successful, is that\n\nthe BIA abused its discretion by failing to make a finding of fact\n\nas to whether Caldero had actual notice of the requirement to file\n\nhis motion to reopen by NACARA's September 11, 1998 deadline, or\n\nwhether    Caldero's      failure    to    file    by    that    date   was   due    to\n\ncircumstances beyond his control.               No such findings of fact were\n\nnecessary.       There is no dispute that Caldero knew, from the 1988\n\nOrder to Show Cause, that his failure to attend a deportation\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fhearing could result in an in absentia deportation order.         Nor is\n\nit disputed that Caldero was notified of, and agreed to attend, his\n\nJuly 1989 hearing. Thus, the threshold question before the BIA was\n\nwhether Caldero had shown an adequate excuse for his failure to\n\nattend his July 1989 hearing, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) (1988);4 his\n\nfailure to make any argument on this score at all to the BIA sealed\n\nthe fate of his appeal, as Caldero provided the BIA with no reason\n\nto reopen the deportation order at all and thus no reason to\n\ninquire into the reasons Caldero missed NACARA's filing deadline.\n\n          The   government   notes   that   Caldero's   brief   may also\n\nsuggest an equitable tolling claim.         Caldero's alleged lack of\n\nactual notice of the deportation order and of the NACARA deadline\n\nfor motions to reopen of September 11, 1998 conceivably could be\n\nrelevant to an equitable tolling argument, but Caldero has offered\n\nno authority suggesting that equitable tolling principles may be\n\n\n\n     4\n      The parties appear to disagree about the relevant standard to\nbe applied in assessing an excuse for Caldero's failure to appear\nfor his July 1989 hearing.        Caldero's arguments discussing\n\"exceptional circumstances\" appear to draw upon the standard\narticulated in 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3) (1994), later recodified at\n8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5) (Supp. II 1997), which requires an alien\nseeking to reopen an in absentia removal order to show either that\nhe did not receive notice of the removal hearing, or that his\nfailure to appear was a result of \"exceptional circumstances.\" In\ncontrast, the government argues in its brief that the \"reasonable\ncause\" standard of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) (1988) applies; that was the\nstatute and standard used by the BIA. Which of these standards\napplies and what the difference is between the two, however, are\nnot material questions for this case, as Caldero has not made any\nargument at all as to why he did not attend his July 1989 hearing,\nand he thus fails to satisfy either test.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fapplied to the NACARA motions deadline, nor has he developed any\n\nlegal argument in support of that conclusion. The argument is thus\n\nwaived.   United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by\n\nsome effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").5\n\n            Additionally, even assuming the doubtful premise that\n\nCaldero would be able to show the due diligence required for\n\nequitable tolling, see, e.g., Ouk v. Mukasey, 551 F.3d 82, 83 (1st\n\nCir. 2008), we note that he did not proffer an explanation to the\n\nBIA for his delay in filing his motion to reopen -- filed in 2006,\n\nroughly eight years after the NACARA deadline expired and two years\n\nafter the DHS interview.         This alone would seem enough to defeat an\n\nargument for equitable tolling.           Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75,\n\n80 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"[T]heories not advanced before the BIA may not\n\nbe surfaced for the first time in a petition for judicial review of\n\nthe BIA's final order.\").\n\n            Caldero's final argument is that we \"should require the\n\n[BIA] to state its reasons and show proper consideration to all\n\nfactors when weighing equities and denying relief,\" by which he\n\nappears   to    mean      that   the   reasoning   in    the   BIA's   order   was\n\ninsufficient.       We disagree.       The BIA offered a specific and cogent\n\nstatement      of   the    relevant     facts   and     correctly   applied    the\n\n\n     5\n      We reserve judgment on both the availability of such tolling\nin future cases and on our ability to review the BIA's decisions as\nto this issue.\n\n                                         -9-\n\fapplicable law. The rationale for the decision is clear -- Caldero\n\nhad notice of the July 1989 hearing, failed to attend, and did not\n\nshow reasonable cause for that failure -- and there is no sign that\n\nit   failed    to    consider   relevant    evidence   or   law,    or   that   it\n\notherwise abused its discretion.\n\n              The three Ninth Circuit cases Caldero cites in support of\n\nthis argument are neither binding upon us nor contrary to our\n\nconclusions.        In Tukhowinich v. INS, 64 F.3d 460 (9th Cir. 1995),\n\nthe BIA wrongly stated that the IJ had considered certain evidence\n\nrelevant to the petitioner's appeal.             Id. at 463.     In Georgia v.\n\nINS, 90 F.3d 374 (9th Cir. 1996), the BIA \"failed to adhere to the\n\nrequirement that it weigh both favorable and unfavorable factors\n\nand did not properly explain the basis for its decision.\"                 Id. at\n\n376.    In Arrozal v. INS, 159 F.3d 429 (9th Cir. 1998), the BIA\n\nerred \"by failing to consider all [of the petitioner's] favorable\n\nfactors and by not weighing those favorable factors against the\n\nnegative factors that [it] thoroughly discussed.\"              Id. at 435.      We\n\nfind nothing in the record to indicate that the BIA made any of\n\nthese errors here.\n\n              This is not to say that Caldero's petition is wholly\n\nunsympathetic; we are cognizant of his health difficulties and of\n\nthe treatment regimen his doctor advocates. But judicial review of\n\nthe BIA's decisions is circumscribed by statute, and within the\n\nscope   of    that    review,   we   have   no   justification     for   granting\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fCaldero's petition.   The petition is therefore DISMISSED in part,\n\nand otherwise DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

Caldero had hoped to reopen the proceedings so as to adjudicate his application for cancellation of removal under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (\"NACARA\"), Pub.L. No. 105-100, § 203, 111 Stat. 2160, 2196 (1997), set forth at 8 U.S.C. § 1101 note. Lacking jurisdiction over one of Caldero's claims, and finding no error of law or abuse of discretion in the BIA's disposition of this matter, we dismiss the petition in part, and deny it as to the rest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In 1988, Caldero entered the United States, was detained by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\"), and was placed into deportation proceedings for having entered the United States without inspection. In April 1989, proceeding <i>pro se,</i> Caldero attended an Immigration Court hearing and was granted a continuance, his second, to allow him additional time to obtain counsel; his hearing was reset for July, 1989, and the record reflects that he was advised of the new date.<sup>[1]</sup> Before the continuance was granted, Caldero signed a written statement attesting, \"If a continuance is granted, I will follow the order of the Court and appear on the appointed date, just as I have appeared today for this hearing.\" On the appointed date in July, however, Caldero did not appear, and after finding that the INS had proved his deportability (now called removability) by \"clear, convincing, and unequivocal\" evidence, the Immigration Judge ordered him deported <i>in absentia.</i> The record reflects that the deportation order was served on Caldero by mail at his last known address, which Caldero himself had supplied at a prior hearing.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In 2003, Caldero filed for relief under NACARA.<sup>[3]</sup> In 2004, during an interview <span class=\"star-pagination\">*347</span> with the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), Caldero was advised that because he had an outstanding deportation order against him and had missed NACARA's September 11, 1998 deadline for untimely motions to reopen for purposes of obtaining a cancellation of removal, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1003.43(e)(1), he could not apply for NACARA relief.</p>\n<p>In 2006, Caldero filed the instant motion to reopen the deportation proceedings against him, arguing that he was never provided notice of the <i>in absentia</i> deportation order, and therefore he could not have known that the 1998 deadline applied to him. The motion further argued that his \"serious physical and mental health issues,\" namely, the debilitating effects of the AIDS and Kaposi's Sarcoma diseases with which he has been afflicted since 1995, \"require his presence in the United States for continued treatment,\" and that his health will deteriorate due to lack of appropriate medical care if he is returned to El Salvador. The motion, however, omitted any explanation for his failure to attend the July 1989 deportation hearing.</p>\n<p>The IJ denied Caldero's motion in a written decision. The IJ first found that the outstanding deportation order was valid, noting that Caldero had \"received adequate notice of his deportation hearing and nonetheless failed to appear,\" and that Caldero had provided no adequate excuse for the failure. The IJ emphasized that Caldero's health problems, which began in 1995, and his concerns about the difficulties he will encounter if deported were both irrelevant to the legitimacy of the deportation order entered against him or to whether he had adequate notice of it. The IJ then found that Caldero \"cannot claim that ignorance of his deportation order excuses a delay of over seventeen years,\" since Caldero was put on notice by the 1988 Order to Show Cause that \"[f]ailure to attend the hearing ... may result in a determination being made by the Immigration Judge in your absence,\" was advised of the date and time for his July 1989 hearing, and was informed of the deportation order against him by mail. Finally, the IJ found that Caldero could not reopen his deportation proceedings pursuant to NACARA.

In a footnote, the BIA noted that any application made for cancellation of removal pursuant to NACARA was untimely because the motion to reopen was made after NACARA's September 11, 1998 deadline.

Gonzales,</i> 484 F.3d 125, 127 (1st Cir.2007))).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Caldero mounts three challenges to the BIA's decision, none of them persuasive. First, he argues that the BIA erred in failing to reopen his case <i>sua sponte,</i> both because the IJ failed to analyze Caldero's allegedly exceptional circumstances, and because those circumstances warrant reopening. We disagree with Caldero's premise that the IJ failed to consider the circumstances he adverts to, namely, his health problems, his alleged lack of notice of the deportation order, and the difficulties he anticipates were he deported to El Salvador; these issues were explicitly addressed in the IJ's order. But whether the IJ addressed Caldero's circumstances is beside the point, for our circuit precedent makes clear that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA's refusal to reopen a deportation order <i>sua sponte. </i><i>Peralta v. Holder,</i> 567 F.3d 31, 34-35 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Luis,</i> 196 F.3d at 40.</p>\n<p>Caldero's second argument, no more successful, is that the BIA abused its discretion by failing to make a finding of fact as to whether Caldero had actual notice of the requirement to file his motion to reopen by NACARA's September 11, 1998 deadline, or whether Caldero's failure to file by that date was due to circumstances beyond his control. No such findings of fact were necessary. There is no dispute that Caldero knew, from the 1988 Order to Show Cause, that his failure to attend a deportation hearing could result in an <i>in absentia</i> deportation order. Nor is it disputed that Caldero was notified of, and agreed to attend, his July 1989 hearing. Thus, the threshold question before the BIA was whether Caldero had shown an adequate excuse for his failure to attend his July 1989 hearing, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) (1988);<sup>[4]</sup> his failure to make any argument on this score at all to the BIA sealed the fate of his appeal, as Caldero provided the BIA with no reason to reopen the deportation order at all and thus no reason to inquire into the reasons Caldero missed NACARA's filing deadline.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*349</span> The government notes that Caldero's brief may also suggest an equitable tolling claim. Caldero's alleged lack of actual notice of the deportation order and of the NACARA deadline for motions to reopen of September 11, 1998 conceivably could be relevant to an equitable tolling argument, but Caldero has offered no authority suggesting that equitable tolling principles may be applied to the NACARA motions deadline, nor has he developed any legal argument in support of that conclusion. The argument is thus waived. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Additionally, even assuming the doubtful premise that Caldero would be able to show the due diligence required for equitable tolling, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Ouk v. Mukasey,</i> 551 F.3d 82, 83 (1st Cir.2008), we note that he did not proffer an explanation to the BIA for his delay in filing his motion to reopenfiled in 2006, roughly eight years after the NACARA deadline expired and two years after the DHS interview. This alone would seem enough to defeat an argument for equitable tolling. <i>Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> 387 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir.2004) (\"[T]heories not advanced before the BIA may not be surfaced for the first time in a petition for judicial review of the BIA's final order.\").</p>\n<p>Caldero's final argument is that we \"should require the [BIA] to state its reasons and show proper consideration to all factors when weighing equities and denying relief,\" by which he appears to mean that the reasoning in the BIA's order was insufficient. We disagree. The BIA offered a specific and cogent statement of the relevant facts and correctly applied the applicable law. The rationale for the decision is clearCaldero had notice of the July 1989 hearing, failed to attend, and did not show reasonable cause for that failureand there is no sign that it failed to consider relevant evidence or law, or that it otherwise abused its discretion.</p>\n<p>The three Ninth Circuit cases Caldero cites in support of this argument are neither binding upon us nor contrary to our conclusions. In <i>Tukhowinich v. INS,</i> 64 F.3d 460 (9th Cir.1995), the BIA wrongly stated that the IJ had considered certain evidence relevant to the petitioner's appeal. <i>Id.</i> at 463. In <i>Georgiu v. INS,</i> 90 F.3d 374 (9th Cir.1996), the BIA \"failed to adhere to the requirement that it weigh both favorable and unfavorable factors and did not properly explain the basis for its decision.\" <i>Id.</i> at 376. In <i>Arrozal v. INS,</i> 159 F.3d 429 (9th Cir.1998), the BIA erred \"by failing to consider all [of the petitioner's] favorable factors and by not weighing those favorable factors against the negative factors that [it] thoroughly discussed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 435. We find nothing in the record to indicate that the BIA made any of these errors here.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that Caldero's petition is wholly unsympathetic; we are cognizant of his health difficulties and of the treatment regimen his doctor advocates. But judicial review of the BIA's decisions is circumscribed by statute, and within the scope of that review, we have no justification for granting Caldero's petition. The petition is therefore <i>DISMISSED</i> in part, and otherwise <i>DENIED.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  This hearing was not transcribed, but the <i>in absentia</i> deportation order notes that \"[t]he respondent was duly notified of the time and place of the hearing,\" and Caldero has not challenged the fact that he was advised of the new hearing date.</p>\n<p>[2]  The record evidence contains neither affirmative proof that Caldero received the mailing nor an indication that the mail was returned to the sender. We note, however, that there is no genuine dispute as to whether a copy of the deportation order was mailed to Caldero at his last known address; Caldero's contention, discussed below, is simply that he was unaware of the outstanding order.</p>\n<p>[3]  We assume <i>arguendo</i> for purposes of this review that Caldero is eligible for the relief he seeks under NACARA.</p>\n<p>[4]  The parties appear to disagree about the relevant standard to be applied in assessing an excuse for Caldero's failure to appear for his July 1989 hearing. Caldero's arguments discussing \"exceptional circumstances\" appear to draw upon the standard articulated in 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3) (1994), later recodified at 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5) (Supp. II 1997), which requires an alien seeking to reopen an <i>in absentia</i> removal order to show either that he did not receive notice of the removal hearing, or that his failure to appear was a result of \"exceptional circumstances.\" In contrast, the government argues in its brief that the \"reasonable cause\" standard of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) (1988) applies; that was the statute and standard used by the BIA. Which of these standards applies and what the difference is between the two, however, are not material questions for this case, as Caldero has not made any argument at all as to why he did not attend his July 1989 hearing, and he thus fails to satisfy either test.</p>\n<p>[5]  We reserve judgment on both the availability of such tolling in future cases and on our ability to review the BIA's decisions as to this issue.</p>\n\n</div>",

Caldero had hoped to reopen the proceedings so as to adjudicate his application for cancellation of removal under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (\"NACARA\"), Pub.L. No. 105-100, § 203, 111 Stat. 2160, 2196 (1997), set forth at 8 U.S.C. § 1101 note. Lacking jurisdiction over one of Caldero's claims, and finding no error of law or abuse of discretion in the BIA's disposition of this matter, we dismiss the petition in part, and deny it as to the rest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In 1988, Caldero entered the United States, was detained by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\"), and was placed into deportation proceedings for having entered the United States without inspection. In April 1989, proceeding <i>pro se,</i> Caldero attended an Immigration Court hearing and was granted a continuance, his second, to allow him additional time to obtain counsel; his hearing was reset for July, 1989, and the record reflects that he was advised of the new date.<sup>[1]</sup> Before the continuance was granted, Caldero signed a written statement attesting, \"If a continuance is granted, I will follow the order of the Court and appear on the appointed date, just as I have appeared today for this hearing.\" On the appointed date in July, however, Caldero did not appear, and after finding that the INS had proved his deportability (now called removability) by \"clear, convincing, and unequivocal\" evidence, the Immigration Judge ordered him deported <i>in absentia.</i> The record reflects that the deportation order was served on Caldero by mail at his last known address, which Caldero himself had supplied at a prior hearing.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In 2003, Caldero filed for relief under NACARA.<sup>[3]</sup> In 2004, during an interview <span class=\"star-pagination\">*347</span> with the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), Caldero was advised that because he had an outstanding deportation order against him and had missed NACARA's September 11, 1998 deadline for untimely motions to reopen for purposes of obtaining a cancellation of removal, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1003.43(e)(1), he could not apply for NACARA relief.</p>\n<p>In 2006, Caldero filed the instant motion to reopen the deportation proceedings against him, arguing that he was never provided notice of the <i>in absentia</i> deportation order, and therefore he could not have known that the 1998 deadline applied to him. The motion further argued that his \"serious physical and mental health issues,\" namely, the debilitating effects of the AIDS and Kaposi's Sarcoma diseases with which he has been afflicted since 1995, \"require his presence in the United States for continued treatment,\" and that his health will deteriorate due to lack of appropriate medical care if he is returned to El Salvador. The motion, however, omitted any explanation for his failure to attend the July 1989 deportation hearing.</p>\n<p>The IJ denied Caldero's motion in a written decision. The IJ first found that the outstanding deportation order was valid, noting that Caldero had \"received adequate notice of his deportation hearing and nonetheless failed to appear,\" and that Caldero had provided no adequate excuse for the failure. The IJ emphasized that Caldero's health problems, which began in 1995, and his concerns about the difficulties he will encounter if deported were both irrelevant to the legitimacy of the deportation order entered against him or to whether he had adequate notice of it. The IJ then found that Caldero \"cannot claim that ignorance of his deportation order excuses a delay of over seventeen years,\" since Caldero was put on notice by the 1988 Order to Show Cause that \"[f]ailure to attend the hearing ... may result in a determination being made by the Immigration Judge in your absence,\" was advised of the date and time for his July 1989 hearing, and was informed of the deportation order against him by mail. Finally, the IJ found that Caldero could not reopen his deportation proceedings pursuant to NACARA. Characterizing Caldero's application under NACARA as seeking cancellation of removal, not the adjudication of an asylum claim, the IJ found that Caldero had failed to comply with the September 11, 1998 deadline to file a motion to reopen for adjudication of a cancellation of removal claim. And to the extent that Caldero sought to reopen his deportation order for the consideration of an asylum claim, the IJ noted that Caldero had failed to show the requisite change in country conditions.</p>\n<p>The BIA dismissed Caldero's appeal in a separate written decision. As to the validity of the <i>in absentia</i> deportation order, the BIA acknowledged that \"lack of notice may constitute reasonable cause for missing a hearing,\" but found that because Caldero knew of the July 1989 hearing, signed the written statement agreeing to appear, and failed to allege that he lacked notice of the hearing, he had not shown lack of notice nor any other reasonable cause for failing to appear at his hearing. In a footnote, the BIA noted that any application made for cancellation of removal pursuant to NACARA was untimely because the motion to reopen was made after NACARA's September 11, 1998 deadline. Finally, the BIA rejected Caldero's request to reopen his deportation order on its own motion, stating, \"[W]e do not find that the circumstances of this case warrant the exercise of our limited discretion to reopen <i>sua sponte.</i>\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.
