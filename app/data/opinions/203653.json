Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Boudin, Stahl and Lipez,\n\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     John J. Davis with whom Pierce, Davis & Perritano, LLP was on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Michael J. Sheehan for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        February 2, 2009\n\f             BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.       Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure provides for cost shifting where a defendant offers\n\nto settle, the offer is rejected and the plaintiff thereafter\n\nprevails but recovers less than the offer.           The difficult question\n\nin this case is how the rule should be read and applied in cases\n\nwhere multiple defendants make a joint offer to settle the whole\n\ncase--a situation that the rule's drafters may not have thought\n\nthrough and certainly did not explicitly resolve.\n\n             In the underlying case, Antonio King sued seven New\n\nHampshire corrections officers and employees in federal district\n\ncourt in New Hampshire, alleging constitutional violations while\n\nKing   was    a    pretrial    detainee   in   the   Hillsborough   House    of\n\nCorrections.       The gist of the claims was that he had been falsely\n\naccused of threatening a guard and was thereafter mistreated during\n\nhis confinement.       The five-count complaint charged procedural due\n\nprocess      and   eighth     amendment   violations,    varying    with    the\n\ndefendant.\n\n             According to King's later testimony, on July 14, 2002,\n\nwhile the inmates were out of their cells for recreation, Cesar\n\nRivas, an on-duty corrections officer in a medium security wing of\n\nthe jail (Unit 2D), radioed for assistance, falsely reporting that\n\nhe was in jeopardy of being taken hostage.           Rivas identified King,\n\nalong with eight other inmates, as having threatened him.                  Three\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fother corrections officers then took King to the jail's segregation\n\nunit (Unit 2B), known as \"the hole\".\n\n          Soon after he was taken to the hole, a disciplinary\n\nofficer charged King with disciplinary violations based on Rivas'\n\nreport.   After a hearing, which took place on July 19, King was\n\nsentenced to thirty days in segregation beginning August 9.    After\n\nKing's thirty day sentence was complete, a classification officer\n\nplaced him in administrative segregation, which resulted in his\n\nspending his remaining time at Hillsborough in the hole.      He was\n\nreleased on December 23, 2002.\n\n          While in the hole, King was allowed only a mattress,\n\nsheet, pillow, and prison uniform; everything else was forbidden\n\n(including personal hygiene products and toilet paper).    King had\n\nto ask guards to turn on the water to flush the toilet, drink, or\n\nwash his hands--requests not always satisfied promptly.       He was\n\nallowed out of his cell only once every three days, shackled, in\n\norder to shower and was subject to frequent strip searches.    These\n\nconditions remained throughout his time in segregation.\n\n          This description does not fully capture the grim and\n\nunsanitary circumstances of the confinement.      A more complete\n\ndescription is provided in decisions stemming from the litigation\n\nthat followed.   See, e.g., Surprenant v. Rivas, 424 F.3d 5, 10-11\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).    Although not involving direct brutality, the\n\nconditions were of a kind that might--or might not--lead a jury to\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\ftake a harsh view of the defendants, particularly Rivas if the jury\n\nconcluded that he had falsely reported the events.\n\n          After King filed his law suit, the defendants, jointly\n\nrepresented, invoked Rule 68 and made an offer on January 24, 2005,\n\nto settle with King for a single payment of $10,000, together with\n\nattorney's fees and costs as determined by the court.          The rule, in\n\npertinent part, provides:\n\n          At any time more than 10 days before trial\n          begins, a party defending a claim may serve\n          upon the adverse party an offer to allow\n          judgment to be taken against him for the money\n          or property or to the effect specified in the\n          offer, with costs then accrued . . . . If the\n          judgment finally obtained by the offeree is\n          not more favorable than the offer, the offeree\n          must pay the costs incurred after the making\n          of the offer.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 68.1\n\n          By its terms, the defendants' offer was one to settle the\n\nentire law suit for a fixed sum and did not apportion the sum among\n\nthe seven defendants.     The offer expired under the rule when King\n\ndid not respond within ten days.          On January 6, 2006, King\n\nvoluntarily   dismissed   his   claims   against   four   of    the   seven\n\ndefendants.   After a five day trial involving the remaining three,\n\na jury found only Rivas liable and awarded King $1 in nominal\n\ndamages and $500 in punitive damages.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      This was the text of the rule at the time of the offer.\nMinor stylistic changes took effect on December 1, 2007.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f           On King's motion, the trial judge ordered a new trial on\n\ncompensatory damages; the judge agreed that because the jury had\n\nnecessarily found that Rivas had falsely accused King and led to\n\nhis wrongful punishment, the $1 nominal damage award was contrary\n\nto the substantial weight of the evidence.          In the new trial on\n\ndamages,   the   newly     selected    jury   awarded     King   $5,000   in\n\ncompensatory damages, giving him a total award of $5,500.\n\n           Other inmates have brought their own law suits based on\n\nthe same incident.    In Surprenant v. Rivas, No. 02-391JD, 2004 WL\n\n1858316 (D.N.H. Aug. 17, 2004), aff'd, 424 F.3d 5, decided prior to\n\nKing's trial, a jury found that Rivas and two other defendants also\n\nnamed by King had violated Jason Suprenant's constitutional rights,\n\nawarding nominal and punitive damages against both Rivas and\n\nanother defendant, but only nominal damages against a third,\n\ntotaling   $20,503;      Surprenant    also   recovered     $29,754.50    in\n\nattorney's fees and $3,897.72 in costs.        Id. at *5.\n\n           In Paladin v. Rivas, No. 05-cv-079-SM, 2007 WL 2907263\n\n(D.N.H. Sept. 28, 2007), which followed King's trial, a jury found\n\nthat two other defendants--but not Rivas--had violated inmates\n\nPaladin and West's constitutional rights.          The jury awarded the\n\nplaintiffs nominal damages against both liable defendants and\n\n$50,000 each in punitive damages against one of the defendants; it\n\nalso awarded Paladin alone $50,000 in compensatory damages against\n\nthe other defendant. Id. at *1. Plaintiffs received $33,952.50 in\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fattorney's fees and $1,247.32 in costs.          Id. at *13.      In other\n\ncases, the inmate-plaintiffs settled before trial.\n\n              After King's second trial on compensatory damages, he\n\nmoved as the prevailing party for attorney's fees and costs under\n\n42   U.S.C.    §   1988   (2006).   Rivas   objected,   arguing   that   the\n\nplaintiff's $5,500 judgment was less than the $10,000 offer, and\n\nthat Rule 68 therefore shifted costs to King; accordingly, Rivas\n\nsought to recover his attorney's fees and costs.             The district\n\ncourt held that Rule 68 did not apply because the $10,000 offer had\n\nnot been apportioned among the defendants, and it awarded King\n\nattorney's fees and costs for his claims against Rivas under\n\nsection 1988.      King v. Rivas, No. 04-cv-356-SM, 2008 WL 822236, at\n\n*3-9 (D.N.H. Mar. 26, 2008).\n\n              Rivas has now appealed, arguing that the district court\n\nmisconstrued Rule 68, and our review of such a question is de novo.\n\nSee NEPSK, Inc. v. Houlton, 283 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2002).          Rivas'\n\nposition is straightforward: the defendants' $10,000 offer to King\n\nfor a joint settlement is deemed to have been rejected; King's\n\nultimate recovery from all the defendants named in his suit was\n\nonly $5,500; thus, costs shift to King.\n\n              King responds that the offer was not apportioned and\n\ntherefore did not allow him to determine how much Rivas was\n\noffering to settle the claims against Rivas alone, so the rule is\n\nnot triggered.       But the offer was hardly \"ambiguous\": by its terms\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fit was an offer to settle the whole case, and only the whole case,\n\nfor $10,000--plus costs and attorney's fees to date.              So King is\n\nsaying either that a package offer alone does not trigger the rule\n\nor, in the alternative, must be accompanied by nominal allocations.\n\n           Rule    68   was   written   in     the    singular--referring   to\n\n\"liability of one party to another\"--and nowhere explains how a\n\njoint offer by several defendants should be treated.              But federal\n\nlaw provides, in line with common sense, that \"unless the context\n\nindicates otherwise--words importing the singular include and apply\n\nto several persons, parties or things.\"              1 U.S.C. § 1 (2006); see\n\nJohnston v. Penrod Drilling Co., 803 F.2d 867, 869-70 (5th Cir.\n\n1986).   Compare Duke v. Conchise County, 938 P.2d 84, 90 (Ariz. Ct.\n\nApp. 1997) (finding use of singular \"unambiguous\" in cost rule,\n\nrendering it inapplicable to joint offer).\n\n           In     addition,    Rule     68's     purpose     of   encouraging\n\nsettlements2 strongly supports its adaptation to multi-defendant\n\ncases, and courts have so assumed.          Marek v. Chesny, 473 U.S. 1, 3-\n\n4 (1985) (joint offer by three co-defendants); Delta Air Lines,\n\nInc. v. August, 450 U.S. 346, 350 n.5 (1981) (assuming rule's\n\napplicability to multi-defendant litigation). But how to apply the\n\n\n     2\n      Possibly this attributed purpose is over-emphasized, ignoring\nRule 68's roots in common law practice relating to the right of\ntender. R. Bone, \"To Encourage Settlement\": Rule 68, Offers of\nJudgment, and the History of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\n102 Nw. U.L. Rev. 1561 (2008). But the emphasis on settlement has\nbeen absorbed in later Advisory Committee Notes and by Supreme\nCourt decisions, and so constrains us as well.\n\n                                      -7-\n\frule to joint offers is not addressed by the rule and is ultimately\n\na matter of judicial adaptation of the rule in light of policy.\n\n            Of    course,    tactically     a   plaintiff   would   prefer    an\n\napportioned set of offers that would allow him to pick and choose;\n\nindeed, an offer judged ample as to one defendant could provide\n\nresources    to    continue    the   litigation     against   others.        And\n\nplaintiffs will often gain valuable bargaining information by\n\nlearning which defendants are most eager to settle.\n\n            But in multi-defendant cases where a single employer is\n\nlikely to pay the bill (such as one against a company and several\n\nof its officers), a full settlement will often be the only one that\n\nmakes sense for the company--the likely payor--and the only one\n\nthat will be forthcoming.         As the Supreme Court noted in Marek,\n\n\"[i]f defendants are not allowed to make lump-sum offers that\n\nwould, if accepted, represent their total liability, they would\n\nunderstandably be reluctant to make settlement offers.\"              473 U.S.\n\nat 6-7.\n\n            Often, where there is one harm or a related set of harms,\n\na plaintiff too will be primarily concerned with what the case as\n\na whole \"is worth.\"         In any event, each defendant is entitled to\n\nsay that he will not settle unless the plaintiff settles with all.\n\nAnd how the individual defendants contribute to the settlement fund\n\n(in practice, the institution may well pay for everyone directly or\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fby indemnification) ought ordinarily not be plaintiff's concern in\n\ndeciding whether or not to settle.\n\n           The circuit courts have been divided about variations on\n\nthe central problem.      The Seventh Circuit has insisted that to\n\ntrigger Rule 68 in multi-defendant cases an offer must contain\n\namounts allocated to each defendant, Harbor Motor Co., Inc. v.\n\nArnell Chevrolet-Geo, Inc., 265 F.3d 638, 648-49 (7th Cir. 2001);\n\nbut it did so citing a prior case, Gavoni v. Dobbs House, Inc., 164\n\nF.3d 1071 (7th Cir. 1999), involving joint plaintiffs, who present\n\nquite different problems;3 and the result in Harbor Motor was more\n\nthan justified on a different ground, namely, that the verdict in\n\nfavor of the co-defendant was being reversed, Harbor Motor, 265\n\nF.3d at 644-45, so the plaintiff's total package could in the end\n\nwell exceed the package offer.\n\n           Similarly, the Fifth Circuit also said the failure to\n\nallocate was fatal; but it did so on facts where it was otherwise\n\nplainly right to refuse to shift costs because the judgment against\n\nthe defendant exceeded the offer--when combined with a settlement\n\nreceived   from   the   other.   Johnston,   803   F.2d   at   870.   The\n\n\n     3\n      Package offers to multiple plaintiffs are not by a group (who\nfirst must agree to make the offer and how to fund it) but to a\ngroup--a group in which division of the package among them is an\nissue that they may not be able to resolve and where, in addition,\none plaintiff might be willing to accept the offer but another not.\nThe case law on these issues is inconclusive.         See Amati v.\nWoodstock, 176 F.3d 952, 957-59 (7th Cir.) (Posner, J.), cert.\ndenied, 528 U.S. 985 (1999); Lang v. Gates, 36 F.3d 73, 75 (9th\nCir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1017 (1994).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fapportionment notion was invoked to reach a correct result but one\n\nproperly reached by saying that the joint offer was less than the\n\ntotal amount actually recovered by the plaintiff.\n\n           The Third Circuit, by contrast, approved use of Rule 68\n\ncost shifting where an unapportioned offer had been made that\n\nexceeded the amount recovered; it said that the suit against\n\nmultiple defendants involved joint liability and an indemnification\n\ncontract, although it is not clear how much this mattered to the\n\ncourt nor why it should matter.     Le v. Univ. of Pa., 321 F.3d 403,\n\n408 (3d Cir. 2003).       And district courts have employed Rule 68\n\nwithout difficulty in multiple defendant cases where the offer was\n\nnot   apportioned   and   the   total    recovery   was   less   than   the\n\nunapportioned offer.4\n\n           Assuming that defendants are entitled to trigger Rule 68\n\nby a package offer, an allocation requirement makes no sense.           Any\n\nsuch allocation is nominal since it does not represent an actual\n\noffer by an individual defendant that can be accepted by the\n\nplaintiff independently of the package. Still less is there reason\n\nto believe that, if the package offer is accepted, individual\n\ndefendants will bear their apportioned shares, all of which may\n\nwell be paid by the employer or otherwise divided.\n\n\n      4\n      Jolly v. Coughlin, No. 92 CIV. 9026 (JGK), 1999 WL 20895, at\n*5-6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 19, 1999); Stewart v. Sonoma County, 634 F.\nSupp. 773, 775-76 (N.D. Cal. 1986). But see Doe v. Keala, 361 F.\nSupp. 2d 1171, 1178-80 (D. Haw. 2005); Jones v. Fleetwood Motor\nHomes, 127 F. Supp. 2d 958, 970-71 (N.D. Ill. 2000).\n\n                                  -10-\n\f           Nor is such a nominal allocation necessary to a package\n\noffer.    If a trial results in a judgment encompassing all of the\n\ndefendants, apportionment is beside the point: it is easy to see\n\nwhether the total recovery exceeded the package offer.            And, where\n\nsome defendants settle or are dropped, as in this case, it is still\n\neasy enough to ask whether plaintiff's total recovery exceeded the\n\ntotal offer, treating a settlement as a recovery and a dismissed or\n\nprevailing defendant as a zero recovery.5\n\n              Requiring a nominal allocation in what is solely a\n\npackage offer confuses form with substance: separate offers require\n\nallocation because they can be separately accepted; but with a\n\npackage offer there is no allocation because there are no separate\n\noffers.      By its language Rule 68 does not suggest a nominal\n\nallocation requirement, and it is almost impossible to see how such\n\nan allocation would be made where, as here and in many cases,\n\npotential liabilities of claims and defendants have some overlap.\n\n           Nor is it clear that such a nominal allocation would\n\nserve plaintiffs' interests.      Imagine a case where the package of\n\nrecoveries    exceeds   the   package   offer   but   some   of   the   awards\n\n\n\n     5\n      In some situations there will be no way to determine\ncomparability--for example, if a claim against one defendant has\nyet to be tried. Cf. Harbor Motor, 265 F.3d at 644-45. But see\nStewart, 634 F. Supp. at 775-76. But in those cases defendants\nsimply will not recover costs, as it is the defendant's burden to\nestablish comparability.    See, e.g., Reiter v. MTA N.Y. City\nTransit Auth., 457 F.3d 224, 231 (2d Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 549\nU.S. 1211 (2007).\n\n                                   -11-\n\fexceeded the nominal allocation (assuming one had been required)\n\nand some were below.   In that case, the plaintiff might well prefer\n\ncomparison of the total amount of the joint offer to the aggregate\n\nrecovery, as opposed to comparing the nominal allocations to\n\nseparate recoveries and shifting costs as to some, but not all, of\n\nthe defendants.\n\n          So we agree with the outcomes in the Seventh and Fifth\n\nCircuit decisions (Harbor Motor and Johnston) because comparability\n\nwas impossible in the first case and favored the plaintiff in the\n\nsecond, but not the putative rationales adopted by those courts,\n\nand we align ourselves with the Third Circuit, save that we do not\n\nsee why it matters whether liability was joint or several or how\n\nthe defendants were related: a package offer is simply to be taken\n\non its own terms and compared with the total recovery package.\n\n          At least two district courts have followed this approach,\n\nseemingly without difficulty.    See note 4, above.    And, perhaps\n\nmore important, many states have counterparts to Rule 68 and,\n\nalthough there is some variance in wording of their rules, most\n\ntreat apportionment as unnecessary to package offers by multiple\n\ndefendants to a single plaintiff.      Kidwell, Application of State\n\nOffer of Judgment Rule--Apportionment Issues in Multiple Party\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fSetting, 125 A.L.R. 5th 193, 246-56 (2005) (collecting cases from\n\ntwenty-seven states).6\n\n            Although     this   reading      of     Rule   68     seems   to     us\n\nstraightforward,   the     outcome   in     this    particular     case   is   not\n\nentirely welcome. Unlike many state counterparts, Rule 68 operates\n\nonly in favor of defendants; courts ordinarily award costs to the\n\nprevailing party, 28 U.S.C. § 1920 (2006); Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d),\n\nbut Rule 68 makes them mandatory in favor of defendants where the\n\nrecovery failed to exceed the offer.             But traditional costs under\n\nsection    1920--e.g.,    transcript      fees     and   the    like--have     been\n\nrelatively modest, which explains why Rule 68 was for some time\n\nalmost ignored.\n\n            However, the Rule 68 stakes were raised when in Marek, a\n\nsharply divided Supreme Court held--seemingly at odds with common\n\nlaw practice--that \"costs\" under Rule 68 included attorney's fees,\n\nwhere (as here under section 1988) the underlying statute permits\n\nthem as part of costs allowed to a prevailing party.                473 U.S. at\n\n7-11.     Further, where attorney's fees are allowed, the statutes\n\nsometimes include attorney's fees \"as costs\" and other times allow\n\ncosts \"and\" attorney's fees, avoiding Marek; but Marek is the law\n\nand we are bound by it.\n\n\n     6\n      It appears that only two states have gone the other way, id.\nat 256-60, and in one instance where a court held otherwise the\nsubstantive rule was simply revised to make apportionment\nunnecessary. Id. at 257-58; Chavez v. Sievers, 43 P.3d 1022, 1027-\n28 (Nev. 2002).\n\n                                     -13-\n\f            In this circuit, Marek's consequences have been limited\n\nbecause this court, like several other circuits, holds that it does\n\nnot permit an award of attorney's fees to a defendant under Rule\n\n68;7 but Marek can (and in this case, does) cut off post-offer\n\nattorneys fees for the plaintiff where recovery does not exceed the\n\noffer.     Such fees are likely to greatly dwarf what are normally\n\ncalled costs and, of course, their denial affects the incentives to\n\nbring suits on behalf of indigent plaintiffs.\n\n            Denial of post-offer attorney's fees under Marek seems\n\nfair enough where the plaintiff was unreasonable in rejecting an\n\nadequate    defense   offer--whether    proffered    by   an   individual\n\ndefendant or in package form from several.          But an offer may be\n\nreasonably rejected and then the jury prove much stingier than\n\nmight be expected; that was perhaps the case here and, if so, the\n\noutcome may seem unfair.    Compare Surprenant, 2004 WL 1858316, at\n\n*5; Paladin, 2007 WL 2907263, at *1, 13.\n\n            Such outcomes could be avoided if courts could read into\n\nRule 68 a discretionary power of the judge not to allow costs where\n\nthe result would be unfair.      But Rule 68 uses the term \"must,\"\n\n\n     7\n      Crossman v. Marcoccio, 806 F.2d 329, 334 (1st Cir. 1986),\ncert. denied, 481 U.S. 1029 (1987). Other circuits--including the\nThird, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth--have also limited fee\nshifting in this fashion. See, e.g., Harbor Motor, 265 F.3d at\n646-47. But see Jordan v. Time, Inc., 111 F.3d 102, 105 (11th Cir.\n1997). Rivas has not seriously argued to us that he is entitled to\npost-offer attorney's fees, and Crossman clearly states that \"Rule\n68 can never require prevailing civil rights plaintiffs to pay\ndefendants' post-offer attorney's fees.\" 806 F.2d at 334.\n\n                                 -14-\n\fDelta emphasized the rule's language, 450 U.S. at 351-52, and\n\nefforts to modify Rule 68 in various ways have given rise to bitter\n\ncontroversy.    Nor has plaintiff suggested that the district court\n\nhad any such discretion.\n\n            But the problem results from the interaction of Rule 68's\n\nseemingly mandatory phrasing and the Marek decision, and it is\n\nwholly   independent of whether package offers require allocation.\n\nCircumstances shape rules; but in the end the rules must be sound,\n\nand there is no reason to think that package offers are any more\n\nlikely to produce doubtful outcomes than do ordinary single-\n\ndefendant   offers.       Reform    of   Rule   68   itself   is   beyond   our\n\ncompetence.\n\n            The order denying relief under Rule 68 is vacated and the\n\nmatter   remanded   for   further    proceedings     consistent     with    this\n\ndecision.     On remand, Rivas is entitled under Rule 68 to costs\n\nincurred after the Rule 68 offer but no attorney's fees.             King, as\n\nthe prevailing plaintiff, is presumptively entitled to attorney's\n\nfees and costs accrued prior to the Rule 68 offer.                 Each party\n\nshall bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f",

Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Boudin, Stahl and Lipez,\n\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     John J.

Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure provides for cost shifting where a defendant offers\n\nto settle, the offer is rejected and the plaintiff thereafter\n\nprevails but recovers less than the offer.           The difficult question\n\nin this case is how the rule should be read and applied in cases\n\nwhere multiple defendants make a joint offer to settle the whole\n\ncase--a situation that the rule's drafters may not have thought\n\nthrough and certainly did not explicitly resolve.\n\n             In the underlying case, Antonio King sued seven New\n\nHampshire corrections officers and employees in federal district\n\ncourt in New Hampshire, alleging constitutional violations while\n\nKing   was    a    pretrial    detainee   in   the   Hillsborough   House    of\n\nCorrections.       The gist of the claims was that he had been falsely\n\naccused of threatening a guard and was thereafter mistreated during\n\nhis confinement.       The five-count complaint charged procedural due\n\nprocess      and   eighth     amendment   violations,    varying    with    the\n\ndefendant.\n\n             According to King's later testimony, on July 14, 2002,\n\nwhile the inmates were out of their cells for recreation, Cesar\n\nRivas, an on-duty corrections officer in a medium security wing of\n\nthe jail (Unit 2D), radioed for assistance, falsely reporting that\n\nhe was in jeopardy of being taken hostage.           Rivas identified King,\n\nalong with eight other inmates, as having threatened him.                  Three\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fother corrections officers then took King to the jail's segregation\n\nunit (Unit 2B), known as \"the hole\".\n\n          Soon after he was taken to the hole, a disciplinary\n\nofficer charged King with disciplinary violations based on Rivas'\n\nreport.   After a hearing, which took place on July 19, King was\n\nsentenced to thirty days in segregation beginning August 9.    After\n\nKing's thirty day sentence was complete, a classification officer\n\nplaced him in administrative segregation, which resulted in his\n\nspending his remaining time at Hillsborough in the hole.      He was\n\nreleased on December 23, 2002.\n\n          While in the hole, King was allowed only a mattress,\n\nsheet, pillow, and prison uniform; everything else was forbidden\n\n(including personal hygiene products and toilet paper).    King had\n\nto ask guards to turn on the water to flush the toilet, drink, or\n\nwash his hands--requests not always satisfied promptly.       He was\n\nallowed out of his cell only once every three days, shackled, in\n\norder to shower and was subject to frequent strip searches.    These\n\nconditions remained throughout his time in segregation.\n\n          This description does not fully capture the grim and\n\nunsanitary circumstances of the confinement.      A more complete\n\ndescription is provided in decisions stemming from the litigation\n\nthat followed.   See, e.g., Surprenant v. Rivas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201815\"><a href=\"/opinion/201815/surprenant-v-rivas/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10-11\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).    Although not involving direct brutality, the\n\nconditions were of a kind that might--or might not--lead a jury to\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\ftake a harsh view of the defendants, particularly Rivas if the jury\n\nconcluded that he had falsely reported the events.\n\n          After King filed his law suit, the defendants, jointly\n\nrepresented, invoked Rule 68 and made an offer on January 24, 2005,\n\nto settle with King for a single payment of $10,000, together with\n\nattorney's fees and costs as determined by the court.          The rule, in\n\npertinent part, provides:\n\n          At any time more than 10 days before trial\n          begins, a party defending a claim may serve\n          upon the adverse party an offer to allow\n          judgment to be taken against him for the money\n          or property or to the effect specified in the\n          offer, with costs then accrued . . . . If the\n          judgment finally obtained by the offeree is\n          not more favorable than the offer, the offeree\n          must pay the costs incurred after the making\n          of the offer.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 68.1\n\n          By its terms, the defendants' offer was one to settle the\n\nentire law suit for a fixed sum and did not apportion the sum among\n\nthe seven defendants.     The offer expired under the rule when King\n\ndid not respond within ten days.          On January 6, 2006, King\n\nvoluntarily   dismissed   his   claims   against   four   of    the   seven\n\ndefendants.   After a five day trial involving the remaining three,\n\na jury found only Rivas liable and awarded King $1 in nominal\n\ndamages and $500 in punitive damages.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      This was the text of the rule at the time of the offer.\nMinor stylistic changes took effect on December 1, 2007.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f           On King's motion, the trial judge ordered a new trial on\n\ncompensatory damages; the judge agreed that because the jury had\n\nnecessarily found that Rivas had falsely accused King and led to\n\nhis wrongful punishment, the $1 nominal damage award was contrary\n\nto the substantial weight of the evidence.          In the new trial on\n\ndamages,   the   newly     selected    jury   awarded     King   $5,000   in\n\ncompensatory damages, giving him a total award of $5,500.\n\n           Other inmates have brought their own law suits based on\n\nthe same incident.

Sept. 28, 2007), which followed King's trial, a jury found\n\nthat two other defendants--but not Rivas--had violated inmates\n\nPaladin and West's constitutional rights.          The jury awarded the\n\nplaintiffs nominal damages against both liable defendants and\n\n$50,000 each in punitive damages against one of the defendants; it\n\nalso awarded Paladin alone $50,000 in compensatory damages against\n\nthe other defendant. Id. at *1. Plaintiffs received $33,952.50 in\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fattorney's fees and $1,247.32 in costs.          Id. at *13.      In other\n\ncases, the inmate-plaintiffs settled before trial.\n\n              After King's second trial on compensatory damages, he\n\nmoved as the prevailing party for attorney's fees and costs under\n\n42   U.S.C.    §   1988   (2006).   Rivas   objected,   arguing   that   the\n\nplaintiff's $5,500 judgment was less than the $10,000 offer, and\n\nthat Rule 68 therefore shifted costs to King; accordingly, Rivas\n\nsought to recover his attorney's fees and costs.             The district\n\ncourt held that Rule 68 did not apply because the $10,000 offer had\n\nnot been apportioned among the defendants, and it awarded King\n\nattorney's fees and costs for his claims against Rivas under\n\nsection 1988.

Mar. 26, 2008).\n\n              Rivas has now appealed, arguing that the district court\n\nmisconstrued Rule 68, and our review of such a question is de novo.\n\nSee NEPSK, Inc. v. Houlton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199866\"><a href=\"/opinion/199866/nepsk-inc-v-town-of-houlton/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5 (1st Cir. 2002).          Rivas'\n\nposition is straightforward: the defendants' $10,000 offer to King\n\nfor a joint settlement is deemed to have been rejected; King's\n\nultimate recovery from all the defendants named in his suit was\n\nonly $5,500; thus, costs shift to King.\n\n              King responds that the offer was not apportioned and\n\ntherefore did not allow him to determine how much Rivas was\n\noffering to settle the claims against Rivas alone, so the rule is\n\nnot triggered.       But the offer was hardly \"ambiguous\": by its terms\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fit was an offer to settle the whole case, and only the whole case,\n\nfor $10,000--plus costs and attorney's fees to date.              So King is\n\nsaying either that a package offer alone does not trigger the rule\n\nor, in the alternative, must be accompanied by nominal allocations.\n\n           Rule    68   was   written   in     the    singular--referring   to\n\n\"liability of one party to another\"--and nowhere explains how a\n\njoint offer by several defendants should be treated.              But federal\n\nlaw provides, in line with common sense, that \"unless the context\n\nindicates otherwise--words importing the singular include and apply\n\nto several persons, parties or things.\"              1 U.S.C. § 1 (2006); see\n\nJohnston v.

But how to apply the\n\n\n     2\n      Possibly this attributed purpose is over-emphasized, ignoring\nRule 68's roots in common law practice relating to the right of\ntender. R. Bone, \"To Encourage Settlement\": Rule 68, Offers of\nJudgment, and the History of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\n102 Nw. U.L. Rev. 1561 (2008). But the emphasis on settlement has\nbeen absorbed in later Advisory Committee Notes and by Supreme\nCourt decisions, and so constrains us as well.\n\n                                      -7-\n\frule to joint offers is not addressed by the rule and is ultimately\n\na matter of judicial adaptation of the rule in light of policy.\n\n            Of    course,    tactically     a   plaintiff   would   prefer    an\n\napportioned set of offers that would allow him to pick and choose;\n\nindeed, an offer judged ample as to one defendant could provide\n\nresources    to    continue    the   litigation     against   others.        And\n\nplaintiffs will often gain valuable bargaining information by\n\nlearning which defendants are most eager to settle.\n\n            But in multi-defendant cases where a single employer is\n\nlikely to pay the bill (such as one against a company and several\n\nof its officers), a full settlement will often be the only one that\n\nmakes sense for the company--the likely payor--and the only one\n\nthat will be forthcoming.         As the Supreme Court noted in Marek,\n\n\"[i]f defendants are not allowed to make lump-sum offers that\n\nwould, if accepted, represent their total liability, they would\n\nunderstandably be reluctant to make settlement offers.\"              473 U.S.\n\nat 6-7.\n\n            Often, where there is one harm or a related set of harms,\n\na plaintiff too will be primarily concerned with what the case as\n\na whole \"is worth.\"         In any event, each defendant is entitled to\n\nsay that he will not settle unless the plaintiff settles with all.\n\nAnd how the individual defendants contribute to the settlement fund\n\n(in practice, the institution may well pay for everyone directly or\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fby indemnification) ought ordinarily not be plaintiff's concern in\n\ndeciding whether or not to settle.\n\n           The circuit courts have been divided about variations on\n\nthe central problem.      The Seventh Circuit has insisted that to\n\ntrigger Rule 68 in multi-defendant cases an offer must contain\n\namounts allocated to each defendant, Harbor Motor Co., Inc. v.\n\nArnell Chevrolet-Geo, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774922\"><a href=\"/opinion/774922/harbor-motor-company-incorporated-dba-harbor-oldsmobile-gmc-truck-an/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 648-49 (7th Cir. 2001);\n\nbut it did so citing a prior case, Gavoni v.

The\n\n\n     3\n      Package offers to multiple plaintiffs are not by a group (who\nfirst must agree to make the offer and how to fund it) but to a\ngroup--a group in which division of the package among them is an\nissue that they may not be able to resolve and where, in addition,\none plaintiff might be willing to accept the offer but another not.\nThe case law on these issues is inconclusive.

And district courts have employed Rule 68\n\nwithout difficulty in multiple defendant cases where the offer was\n\nnot   apportioned   and   the   total    recovery   was   less   than   the\n\nunapportioned offer.4\n\n           Assuming that defendants are entitled to trigger Rule 68\n\nby a package offer, an allocation requirement makes no sense.           Any\n\nsuch allocation is nominal since it does not represent an actual\n\noffer by an individual defendant that can be accepted by the\n\nplaintiff independently of the package. Still less is there reason\n\nto believe that, if the package offer is accepted, individual\n\ndefendants will bear their apportioned shares, all of which may\n\nwell be paid by the employer or otherwise divided.\n\n\n      4\n      Jolly v.

If a trial results in a judgment encompassing all of the\n\ndefendants, apportionment is beside the point: it is easy to see\n\nwhether the total recovery exceeded the package offer.            And, where\n\nsome defendants settle or are dropped, as in this case, it is still\n\neasy enough to ask whether plaintiff's total recovery exceeded the\n\ntotal offer, treating a settlement as a recovery and a dismissed or\n\nprevailing defendant as a zero recovery.5\n\n              Requiring a nominal allocation in what is solely a\n\npackage offer confuses form with substance: separate offers require\n\nallocation because they can be separately accepted; but with a\n\npackage offer there is no allocation because there are no separate\n\noffers.      By its language Rule 68 does not suggest a nominal\n\nallocation requirement, and it is almost impossible to see how such\n\nan allocation would be made where, as here and in many cases,\n\npotential liabilities of claims and defendants have some overlap.\n\n           Nor is it clear that such a nominal allocation would\n\nserve plaintiffs' interests.      Imagine a case where the package of\n\nrecoveries    exceeds   the   package   offer   but   some   of   the   awards\n\n\n\n     5\n      In some situations there will be no way to determine\ncomparability--for example, if a claim against one defendant has\nyet to be tried. Cf. Harbor Motor, 265 F.3d at 644-45. But see\nStewart, 634 F. Supp. at 775-76. But in those cases defendants\nsimply will not recover costs, as it is the defendant's burden to\nestablish comparability.    See, e.g., Reiter v. MTA N.Y. City\nTransit Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 231 (2d Cir. 2006), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1211</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007).\n\n                                   -11-\n\fexceeded the nominal allocation (assuming one had been required)\n\nand some were below.   In that case, the plaintiff might well prefer\n\ncomparison of the total amount of the joint offer to the aggregate\n\nrecovery, as opposed to comparing the nominal allocations to\n\nseparate recoveries and shifting costs as to some, but not all, of\n\nthe defendants.\n\n          So we agree with the outcomes in the Seventh and Fifth\n\nCircuit decisions (Harbor Motor and Johnston) because comparability\n\nwas impossible in the first case and favored the plaintiff in the\n\nsecond, but not the putative rationales adopted by those courts,\n\nand we align ourselves with the Third Circuit, save that we do not\n\nsee why it matters whether liability was joint or several or how\n\nthe defendants were related: a package offer is simply to be taken\n\non its own terms and compared with the total recovery package.\n\n          At least two district courts have followed this approach,\n\nseemingly without difficulty.    See note 4, above.    And, perhaps\n\nmore important, many states have counterparts to Rule 68 and,\n\nalthough there is some variance in wording of their rules, most\n\ntreat apportionment as unnecessary to package offers by multiple\n\ndefendants to a single plaintiff.      Kidwell, Application of State\n\nOffer of Judgment Rule--Apportionment Issues in Multiple Party\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fSetting, 125 A.L.R. 5th 193, 246-56 (2005) (collecting cases from\n\ntwenty-seven states).6\n\n            Although     this   reading      of     Rule   68     seems   to     us\n\nstraightforward,   the     outcome   in     this    particular     case   is   not\n\nentirely welcome. Unlike many state counterparts, Rule 68 operates\n\nonly in favor of defendants; courts ordinarily award costs to the\n\nprevailing party, 28 U.S.C. § 1920 (2006); Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d),\n\nbut Rule 68 makes them mandatory in favor of defendants where the\n\nrecovery failed to exceed the offer.             But traditional costs under\n\nsection    1920--e.g.,    transcript      fees     and   the    like--have     been\n\nrelatively modest, which explains why Rule 68 was for some time\n\nalmost ignored.\n\n            However, the Rule 68 stakes were raised when in Marek, a\n\nsharply divided Supreme Court held--seemingly at odds with common\n\nlaw practice--that \"costs\" under Rule 68 included attorney's fees,\n\nwhere (as here under section 1988) the underlying statute permits\n\nthem as part of costs allowed to a prevailing party.                473 U.S. at\n\n7-11.     Further, where attorney's fees are allowed, the statutes\n\nsometimes include attorney's fees \"as costs\" and other times allow\n\ncosts \"and\" attorney's fees, avoiding Marek; but Marek is the law\n\nand we are bound by it.\n\n\n     6\n      It appears that only two states have gone the other way, id.\nat 256-60, and in one instance where a court held otherwise the\nsubstantive rule was simply revised to make apportionment\nunnecessary.

Such fees are likely to greatly dwarf what are normally\n\ncalled costs and, of course, their denial affects the incentives to\n\nbring suits on behalf of indigent plaintiffs.\n\n            Denial of post-offer attorney's fees under Marek seems\n\nfair enough where the plaintiff was unreasonable in rejecting an\n\nadequate    defense   offer--whether    proffered    by   an   individual\n\ndefendant or in package form from several.          But an offer may be\n\nreasonably rejected and then the jury prove much stingier than\n\nmight be expected; that was perhaps the case here and, if so, the\n\noutcome may seem unfair.

Other circuits--including the\nThird, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth--have also limited fee\nshifting in this fashion. See, e.g., Harbor Motor, 265 F.3d at\n646-47. But see Jordan v.

Rivas has not seriously argued to us that he is entitled to\npost-offer attorney's fees, and Crossman clearly states that \"Rule\n68 can never require prevailing civil rights plaintiffs to pay\ndefendants' post-offer attorney's fees.\" 806 F.2d at 334.\n\n                                 -14-\n\fDelta emphasized the rule's language, 450 U.S. at 351-52, and\n\nefforts to modify Rule 68 in various ways have given rise to bitter\n\ncontroversy.    Nor has plaintiff suggested that the district court\n\nhad any such discretion.\n\n            But the problem results from the interaction of Rule 68's\n\nseemingly mandatory phrasing and the Marek decision, and it is\n\nwholly   independent of whether package offers require allocation.\n\nCircumstances shape rules; but in the end the rules must be sound,\n\nand there is no reason to think that package offers are any more\n\nlikely to produce doubtful outcomes than do ordinary single-\n\ndefendant   offers.       Reform    of   Rule   68   itself   is   beyond   our\n\ncompetence.\n\n            The order denying relief under Rule 68 is vacated and the\n\nmatter   remanded   for   further    proceedings     consistent     with    this\n\ndecision.     On remand, Rivas is entitled under Rule 68 to costs\n\nincurred after the Rule 68 offer but no attorney's fees.             King, as\n\nthe prevailing plaintiff, is presumptively entitled to attorney's\n\nfees and costs accrued prior to the Rule 68 offer.
