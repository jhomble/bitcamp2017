Harnischfeger  moved for  summary  judgment,\n\nclaiming the  Massachusetts  real estate  statute of  repose\n\nbarred the  action.  The  district court agreed  and granted\n\nsummary judgment.  We affirm.\n\n                             I\n                              \n\n                         BACKGROUND\n                                   \n\n          In March 1973,  Rust Engineering Company (\"Rust\"),\n\nan engineering  and construction  firm acting  as agent  for\n\nRefuse   Energy    Systems   Company    (\"RESCO\"),   engaged\n\nHarnischfeger to assist in the design and manufacture of two\n\nthirteen-ton  overhead  cranes  for use  at  RESCO's Saugus,\n\nMassachusetts trash-to-energy  plant.1  The cranes  are used\n\n                    \n\n1Harnischfeger has designed and manufactured overhead cranes\nsince 1906 and has built  more than 24,000 overhead  trolley\ncranes.    Harnischfeger  customizes  each overhead  trolley\ncrane it  manufactures.  Overhead cranes such as those built\nby   Harnischfeger  are   generally  considered   heavy-duty\nmachinery  for specific production purposes and used by many\nindustries to lift and move heavy objects.  \n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nto move  trash into  trash feed hoppers  where the  trash is\n\nburned   and   steam  is   generated   and  converted   into\n\nelectricity.   Rust incorporated the cranes into the plant's\n\nbuildings   as   part    of   the   original   construction.\n\nHarnischfeger was not involved in the design or construction\n\nof the  RESCO facility,  nor did  Harnischfeger install  the\n\ncranes.     \n\n          On December  29, 1987, the trolley wheel of one of\n\nthe overhead cranes  severed David Snow's third,  fourth and\n\nfifth finger and a portion of his right hand.  At  the time,\n\nSnow was  working at the  Saugus facility.  The  Snow family\n\nbrought an action  in Essex Superior Court,  Commonwealth of\n\nMassachusetts,  alleging  the   crane  was  unsafe  due   to\n\nHarnischfeger's failure  to  equip the  trolley  with  wheel\n\nguards and rail  sweeps, automatic audio or  visual movement\n\nalarms,  a  proper  lock-out  system  or  kill  switch,  and\n\nHarnischfeger's  failure   to  warn   of  inherent   risks.2\n\nHarnischfeger  removed  the  action to  the  district  court\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1446, and moved for summary judgment\n\n                    \n\n2In their amended complaint, the Snows charge  Harnischfeger\nwith  defective  design,   negligence,  breach  of   express\nwarranty   and   breach   of   the   implied   warranty   of\nmerchantability.  \n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nunder  the  Massachusetts  real  estate  statute  of  repose\n\n(\"statute\").  \n\n          The statute, Mass.  Gen. Laws Ann.  ch. 260,    2B\n\n(West 1992) (\"M.G.L. c. 260,   2B\"), provides:\n\n          Action [sic] of tort for damages arising\n          out  of any deficiency or neglect in the\n          design,   planning,   construction    or\n          general administration of an improvement\n          to   real  property  .   .  .  shall  be\n          commenced only  within three  years next\n          after  the  cause   of  action  accrues;\n          provided,  however,  that  in  no  event\n          shall  such  actions be  commenced  more\n          than six years after the  earlier of the\n          dates  of:    (1)  the  opening  of  the\n          improvement to  use; or  (2) substantial\n          completion  of the  improvement and  the\n          taking  of possession  for occupancy  by\n          the owner.3 \n\nId.4   The district  court found Harnischfeger  was included\n   \n\nin  the class  of  actors protected  under  the statute  and\n\ngranted the summary judgment motion.5\n\n                    \n\n3Massachusetts courts have construed the statute to apply to\nimplied breach of warranty claims where the underlying cause\nof action is the same as the tort claim.

In  1986, Harnischfeger\ndesigned two replacement trolleys.   The Snows do  not argue\nthat  we should measure the application  of the statute from\nthe date Harnischfeger designed the replacement trolleys.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n          On appeal the  Snows argue (1) the  district court\n\nimproperly  granted summary judgment where genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact remained; (2) the district court impermissibly\n\nextended repose  to the  manufacturer of  a machine  thereby\n\nchanging  Massachusetts'  product  liability  law;  (3)  the\n\ndistrict  court   improperly  found   Harnischfeger  was   a\n\nprotected actor within  the meaning of M.G.L. c.  260,   2B;\n\nand  (4)  questions  of   local  law  are  central  to   the\n\ndisposition of the  appeal and  should be  certified to  the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\").\n\n                             II\n                               \n\n                         DISCUSSION\n                                   \n\nStandard of Review\n                  \n\n          \"We  review a grant  of summary judgment  de novo,\n                                                           \n\nusing  the same criteria incumbent upon the district court.\"\n\nGaskell v.

P. 56(e)).            \n\nIssues of Fact\n              \n\n          According  to the  Snows, four  genuine issues  of\n\nmaterial  fact  remain in  dispute, making  summary judgment\n\ninappropriate.   We have reviewed their contentions and find\n\nthem to be without merit.\n\n          The Snows first argue there is  a genuine issue of\n\nfact  as to  whether Harnischfeger  is  in the  construction\n\nbusiness.6   The Snows do not dispute Harnischfeger designed\n\nand manufactured the crane.  Instead, the Snows assert  that\n\nthese activities are not sufficient for a court to find that\n\nHarnischfeger  is involved in  the construction industry and\n\n                    \n\n6The Snows assert:\n\n          [t]he defendant claimed  that because it\n          manufactured  an  overhead   crane  that\n          became affixed to real  property, it was\n          involved in  the construction  business.\n          The   plaintiffs   contend    that   the\n          defendant's design and manufacture of an\n          overhead crane  which  is  housed  in  a\n          structure  on  real property,  does  not\n          mean the defendant  was involved in  the\n          type  of  construction  contemplated  by\n          M.G.L. c. 260   2B. \n\nBrief of the Plaintiffs-Appellants at 5-6.\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nthat such  involvement is necessary  to bring  Harnischfeger\n\nwithin M.G.L. c.  260,   2B.   Harnischfeger contends M.G.L.\n\nc. 260,   2B provides protection \"`to architects, engineers,\n                                                           \n\ncontractors  and others  involved in  the design,  planning,\n                                                           \n\nconstruction or  general administration  of improvements  to\n\nreal  property'\" and  suggests  it  deserves  repose  as  an\n\n\"`engineer' or `other' involved in the  `design,' `planning'\n\nand  `construction'  of  the  overhead  crane.\"    Brief  of\n\nDefendant-Appellee   at  10-11   (alteration  in   original)\n\n(quoting Klein, 437 N.E.2d at 523).\n              \n\n          Whether a  defendant's activities fall  within the\n\nstatute is a question of law.  See,  e.g., McDonough v. Marr\n                                                            \n\nScaffolding Co., 591  N.E.2d 1079, 1081 (Mass.  1992) (court\n               \n\nappropriately  granted  summary  judgment  after  concluding\n\ndefendant's actions were  construction activity contemplated\n\nby M.G.L. c. 260,    2B).  Moreover, as Harnischfeger notes,\n\nthe statute  does not limit  its protection solely  to those\n\ninvolved  in the actual construction of improvements to real\n\nproperty.    Harnischfeger  may be  a  protected  actor even\n\nwithout being involved in the construction business.  As the\n\ndistrict  court  aptly  stated,  the  Snows'  contention  is\n\n\"merely  [an  argument]  about  how  to  apply  law  to  the\n\nestablished facts.\"  Snow v. Harnischfeger, 823 F. Supp. 22,\n                                          \n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\n24 (D. Mass. 1993).  To the extent there is a dispute, it is\n\nimmaterial to the disposition of the action. \n\n          The Snows  next argue there is a  genuine issue of\n\nfact as to  whether the overhead crane is  a unique product.\n\nThey argue the crane, like many standard cranes,  was merely\n\ncustomized  to fit  inside a  building,  shed or  structure.\n\nHarnischfeger  maintains  that  the  product  is unique  and\n\ncustom  designed for RESCO.  In support Harnischfeger offers\n\naffidavits showing the  following:  Harnischfeger  designed,\n\nmanufactured and constructed the cranes' lifting capacity as\n\nwell as the dimensions of  the major components for specific\n\nplant and  job functions; Rust supplied  specifications that\n\nwere the basis  of the designs including  specified overhead\n\nand  wall  clearances;  and  Harnischfeger  custom  designed\n\nsixteen  component  parts  and  manufactured  and  assembled\n\nvirtually all the components.   The Snows counter that  they\n\nhave  presented evidence  showing the  crane  is a  standard\n\ndesign and the trolley  was previously designed for  sale in\n\nFlorida.  \n\n          The   Snows'    evidence,   which    consists   of\n\nHarnischfeger's brochures and  literature along with  expert\n\naffidavits  and deposition  testimony,  does not  create any\n\ngenuine issue  of fact for  trial.  The  brochures emphasize\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nthat  customers should  avoid  \"standard\" cranes  and should\n\nhave  Harnischfeger's  experts  design  a  crane  that  will\n\nsatisfy their  particular needs.   At  best, the  literature\n\nsuggests Harnischfeger  has standardized the  materials used\n\nto create the  crane and standardized certain  components to\n\nbe mixed and matched into a final product.  In addition, the\n\nopinions  of  Snows'  experts  that the  crane,  as  a final\n\nproduct, is a  basic design similar to cranes  used in other\n\nindustries  do not  contradict Harnischfeger's evidence.   A\n\ncrane   can  be  designed  for  a  particular  location  and\n\nspecialized  function   and  still   retain  the   essential\n\ncharacteristics common to industrial  cranes.  Moreover, the\n\nability  of the  crane  to  be adopted  for  use by  another\n\nindustry  is  immaterial  to  Harnischfeger's  status  as  a\n\nprotected actor  because the relevant  inquiry involves  the\n\nmotivation behind and the activity of producing the product,\n\nnot the product  itself.  See Dighton v.  Federal Pac. Elec.\n                                                            \n\nCo., 506 N.E.2d  509, 516  (Mass. 1987).   Furthermore,  the\n   \n\ndeposition  testimony  of  James  Fravert,  a  Harnischfeger\n\nemployee, does  not establish that  the design of  the RESCO\n\ntrolley was the same as one previously used by Harnischfeger\n\nfor  sale to  Brevard  County, Florida.    Fravert does  not\n\ntestify  that the design was duplicated,  only that a design\n                        \n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\ndrawing  was  duplicated  and  the  duplicated  drawing  was\n       \n\nmodified to create the drawing for the RESCO crane.  \n\n          Lastly, the Snows raise the issue of the status of\n\nthe crane,  arguing first that  there is a genuine  issue of\n\nfact  as to  whether the  crane  is an  improvement to  real\n\nproperty.  Once again, however, the Snows do not dispute any\n\nrelevant  facts but rather  the application of  law to these\n\nfacts.     The   parties   agree   as   to   the   essential\n\ncharacteristics of the crane.  There is an established legal\n\nstandard  defining improvements  for purposes  of  M.G.L. c.\n\n260,     2B  as  well  as case  law  establishing  when  the\n\ndefinition  should be  applied.   See  Milligan v.  Tibbetts\n                                                            \n\nEng'g  Corp., 461  N.E.2d 808,  811  (Mass. 1984)  (adopting\n            \n\ndefinition   found   in    Webster's   Third   International\n\nDictionary);   see  also     Dighton,  506  N.E.2d   at  516\n                                    \n\n(explaining when definition  is useful).  The  Snows suggest\n\nno disputed  facts that  would in any  way preclude  us from\n\napplying the legal standard.\n\n          The Snows also  argue there is a genuine  issue of\n\nfact as to  whether the crane is  a permanent fixture.   The\n\nSJC has rejected adoption of a fixture analysis to determine\n\napplicability of the  statute of repose, noting  the statute\n\n\"makes  no reference to `fixtures,' nor  does it appear that\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nthe Legislature intended,  by its choice of the  common term\n\n`improvement,'  to subsume  that tangle of  highly technical\n\nmeanings, often distinct in diverse legal contexts, which is\n\nthe law  of fixtures.\"  Dighton, 506 F.2d  at 515.  The fact\n                               \n\nthat a product is affixed, permanently or otherwise, neither\n\nmakes the product an improvement nor turns the producer into\n\na protected  actor.   Id.   Thus,  the crane's  status as  a\n                         \n\npermanent fixture is immaterial to our inquiry.  \n\nHarnischfeger as a Protected Actor\n                                  \n\n          The Snows  further challenge the  summary judgment\n\norder by maintaining the  district court acted impermissibly\n\nand   without   precedent  in   applying   the   statute  to\n\nHarnischfeger,  who  they  define  as  \"manufacturers  of  a\n\nmachine.\"  The Snows argue Harnischfeger, as a manufacturer,\n\nis outside  the class  of  actors M.G.L.  c.  260,    2B  is\n\ndesigned  to   protect.    Harnischfeger  admits  to  having\n\nmanufactured the crane but argues a manufacturer who engages\n\nin protected activities is entitled to repose.\n\n          The  purpose  of   the  statute  is  \"to   protect\n\nproviders   of    `individual   expertise'\"    who   \"render\n\nparticularized services  for the design  and construction of\n\nparticular  improvements   to  particular  pieces   of  real\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nproperty.\"   Id.   The  statute  does not  name a  class  of\n                \n\nprotected actors, but  instead extends protection  to \"those\n\nwho  commit  `any  deficiency  or  neglect  in  the  design,\n\nplanning,  construction,  or  general administration  of  an\n\nimprovement to real property.'\"  Id. at 514.  Certain actors\n                                    \n\nobviously fall within  the statute.  See id. at  516.  These\n                                            \n\nactors  include   architects,  engineers   and  contractors.\n\nKlein, 437 N.E.2d at 523.   The statute shields these actors\n     \n\nfrom  any liability  after six  years as  long as  they were\n\ninvolved  in an  enumerated  activity  with  respect  to  an\n\nimprovement  to  real  property.    Other  actors,  such  as\n\nmaterialmen and \"mere\"  suppliers, are outside the  scope of\n\nthe statute  and not entitled  to its protection.   Dighton,\n                                                           \n\n506 N.E.2d at 514 n.10; McDonough, 591 N.E.2d at 1082.\n                                 \n\n          Ambiguity in the  application of M.G.L. c.  260,  \n\n2B arises  when it  is unclear  whether a party  acted as  a\n\nmaterialman or  supplier rather than an architect, engineer,\n\ncontractor, surveyor  or some  other protected  actor.   See\n                                                            \n\nDighton,  506 N.E.2d  at 514.   A  party is not  a protected\n       \n\nactor when the  party does not perform protected  acts.  See\n                                                            \n\nid. at 515.   Conversely, an actor such as a manufacturer or\n   \n\nsupplier may be protected if  that actor becomes more than a\n\n\"mere\"  supplier   by  engaging  in   protected  activities.\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\nMcDonough,  591 N.E.2d  at  1082 (manufacturer  who designed\n         \n\nbleacher units specifically for the  rink in which they were\n\ninstalled by another is more than mere supplier and entitled\n\nto benefit of statute).  Thus, application of the statute is\n\nnecessarily  dependent   on  the   nature  of   the  party's\n\nactivities.7  See Dighton, 506 N.E.2d at 516.  \n                         \n\n          In  Dighton, the defendant  did not claim  to have\n                     \n\nprovided  particularized   services  with  respect   to  the\n\nimprovement  -- the  building  --  but  rather  claimed  the\n\n                    \n\n7The Snows argue that Dighton imposes a requirement upon the\n                             \ncourt to engage in a  two-step analysis to determine whether\nHarnischfeger  is protected  under  M.G.L.  c.  260,     2B.\nAccording  to the  Snows,  Dighton  requires  the  court  to\n                                  \nconsider whether  the statute names the party as a protected\nactor, i.e.,  an architect  or engineer.   If the  answer is\nyes, the court  may determine whether the  defendant engaged\nin protected acts.  \n          Dighton imposes no  such test.  The  Dighton court\n                                                      \nmerely noted  that the  trial judge  framed the question  in\nthis bipartite form.  506 N.E.2d at 514.  The court rejected\nthe bipartite formulation:\n\n          On its  face,   2B defines the protected\n          actor largely by  reference to protected\n          acts.  The body  of   2B names  no class\n          of protected actors.  Rather, its  terms\n          extend protection  to persons  allegedly\n          responsible  for acts,  i.e., those  who\n          commit \"any deficiency or neglect in the\n          design,   planning,   construction,   or\n          general administration of an improvement\n          to real property.\"\n\nId.   Thus, the court can  and must engage in  an activities\n   \nanalysis when the defendant's status as a protected actor is\nunclear.  See id.\n                 \n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nbenefit  of  the  statute as  a  designer,  manufacturer and\n\nsupplier   of  a   component  that  fell   within  Webster's\n\ndefinition of improvement.8   Id. at 515, 516.   The SJC did\n                                 \n\nnot reject the contention that a producer of a component may\n\nbe  entitled  to protection.    See  id.  at 516;  see  also\n                                                            \n\nMcDonough, 591 N.E.2d at 1084.   Instead, the SJC rejected a\n         \n\nformalistic   inquiry   and   established   the   producer's\n\nmotivations and activities as the relevant focus of inquiry,\n\nnot the nature of  the product or the ability to  define the\n\nproduct as an improvement or a fixture.  Dighton, 506 N.E.2d\n                                                \n\nat 516.\n\n          In considering whether an actor not clearly within\n\nthe statute  is entitled to  repose, the court engages  in a\n\nfact-based activities  analysis.

RESCO intended the cranes to be\n\na permanent and integral  part of the overall  plant, making\n\nthe property  useful.   Harnischfeger was  not motivated  to\n\ncreate a fungible crane available to a variety of buyers and\n\nappropriate for  incorporation into a number  of facilities.\n\nHarnischfeger's  actions  conform to  those outlined  by the\n\nDighton Court and are protected activities.10  \n       \n\n          As  the plaintiffs  note,  \"[w]hen faced  with the\n\nquestion of  whether  or not  the defendant  is entitled  to\n\nrepose under  M.G.L. c. 260    2B, the first question  to be\n\nanswered is `Is the defendant a protected actor under M.G.L.\n\nc. 260    2B?'\"   Brief of the Plaintiffs-Appellants  at 11.\n\n                    \n\n10As the Snows'  experts note, a subsequent  purchaser could\nremove  and modify  the  RESCO  cranes  for use  in  another\nindustry, although  this contingency was neither  Rust's nor\nHarnischfeger's intention.

We affirm.\n\n                             I\n                              \n\n                         BACKGROUND\n                                   \n\n          In March 1973,  Rust Engineering Company (\"Rust\"),\n\nan engineering  and construction  firm acting  as agent  for\n\nRefuse   Energy    Systems   Company    (\"RESCO\"),   engaged\n\nHarnischfeger to assist in the design and manufacture of two\n\nthirteen-ton  overhead  cranes  for use  at  RESCO's Saugus,\n\nMassachusetts trash-to-energy  plant.1  The cranes  are used\n\n                    \n\n1Harnischfeger has designed and manufactured overhead cranes\nsince 1906 and has built  more than 24,000 overhead  trolley\ncranes.    Harnischfeger  customizes  each overhead  trolley\ncrane it  manufactures.  Overhead cranes such as those built\nby   Harnischfeger  are   generally  considered   heavy-duty\nmachinery  for specific production purposes and used by many\nindustries to lift and move heavy objects.  \n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nto move  trash into  trash feed hoppers  where the  trash is\n\nburned   and   steam  is   generated   and  converted   into\n\nelectricity.   Rust incorporated the cranes into the plant's\n\nbuildings   as   part    of   the   original   construction.\n\nHarnischfeger was not involved in the design or construction\n\nof the  RESCO facility,  nor did  Harnischfeger install  the\n\ncranes.     \n\n          On December  29, 1987, the trolley wheel of one of\n\nthe overhead cranes  severed David Snow's third,  fourth and\n\nfifth finger and a portion of his right hand.  At  the time,\n\nSnow was  working at the  Saugus facility.  The  Snow family\n\nbrought an action  in Essex Superior Court,  Commonwealth of\n\nMassachusetts,  alleging  the   crane  was  unsafe  due   to\n\nHarnischfeger's failure  to  equip the  trolley  with  wheel\n\nguards and rail  sweeps, automatic audio or  visual movement\n\nalarms,  a  proper  lock-out  system  or  kill  switch,  and\n\nHarnischfeger's  failure   to  warn   of  inherent   risks.2\n\nHarnischfeger  removed  the  action to  the  district  court\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1446, and moved for summary judgment\n\n                    \n\n2In their amended complaint, the Snows charge  Harnischfeger\nwith  defective  design,   negligence,  breach  of   express\nwarranty   and   breach   of   the   implied   warranty   of\nmerchantability.  \n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nunder  the  Massachusetts  real  estate  statute  of  repose\n\n(\"statute\").  \n\n          The statute, Mass.  Gen. Laws Ann.  ch. 260,    2B\n\n(West 1992) (\"M.G.L. c. 260,   2B\"), provides:\n\n          Action [sic] of tort for damages arising\n          out  of any deficiency or neglect in the\n          design,   planning,   construction    or\n          general administration of an improvement\n          to   real  property  .   .  .  shall  be\n          commenced only  within three  years next\n          after  the  cause   of  action  accrues;\n          provided,  however,  that  in  no  event\n          shall  such  actions be  commenced  more\n          than six years after the  earlier of the\n          dates  of:    (1)  the  opening  of  the\n          improvement to  use; or  (2) substantial\n          completion  of the  improvement and  the\n          taking  of possession  for occupancy  by\n          the owner.3 \n\nId.4   The district  court found Harnischfeger  was included\n   \n\nin  the class  of  actors protected  under  the statute  and\n\ngranted the summary judgment motion.5\n\n                    \n\n3Massachusetts courts have construed the statute to apply to\nimplied breach of warranty claims where the underlying cause\nof action is the same as the tort claim.

We have reviewed their contentions and find\n\nthem to be without merit.\n\n          The Snows first argue there is  a genuine issue of\n\nfact  as to  whether Harnischfeger  is  in the  construction\n\nbusiness.6   The Snows do not dispute Harnischfeger designed\n\nand manufactured the crane.  Instead, the Snows assert  that\n\nthese activities are not sufficient for a court to find that\n\nHarnischfeger  is involved in  the construction industry and\n\n                    \n\n6The Snows assert:\n\n          [t]he defendant claimed  that because it\n          manufactured  an  overhead   crane  that\n          became affixed to real  property, it was\n          involved in  the construction  business.\n          The   plaintiffs   contend    that   the\n          defendant's design and manufacture of an\n          overhead crane  which  is  housed  in  a\n          structure  on  real property,  does  not\n          mean the defendant  was involved in  the\n          type  of  construction  contemplated  by\n          M.G.L. c. 260   2B. \n\nBrief of the Plaintiffs-Appellants at 5-6.\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nthat such  involvement is necessary  to bring  Harnischfeger\n\nwithin M.G.L. c.  260,   2B.

Moreover, as Harnischfeger notes,\n\nthe statute  does not limit  its protection solely  to those\n\ninvolved  in the actual construction of improvements to real\n\nproperty.    Harnischfeger  may be  a  protected  actor even\n\nwithout being involved in the construction business.  As the\n\ndistrict  court  aptly  stated,  the  Snows'  contention  is\n\n\"merely  [an  argument]  about  how  to  apply  law  to  the\n\nestablished facts.\"  Snow v. Harnischfeger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248372\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248372/snow-v-harnischfeger-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Mass. 1993).  To the extent there is a dispute, it is\n\nimmaterial to the disposition of the action. \n\n          The Snows  next argue there is a  genuine issue of\n\nfact as to  whether the overhead crane is  a unique product.\n\nThey argue the crane, like many standard cranes,  was merely\n\ncustomized  to fit  inside a  building,  shed or  structure.\n\nHarnischfeger  maintains  that  the  product  is unique  and\n\ncustom  designed for RESCO.  In support Harnischfeger offers\n\naffidavits showing the  following:  Harnischfeger  designed,\n\nmanufactured and constructed the cranes' lifting capacity as\n\nwell as the dimensions of  the major components for specific\n\nplant and  job functions; Rust supplied  specifications that\n\nwere the basis  of the designs including  specified overhead\n\nand  wall  clearances;  and  Harnischfeger  custom  designed\n\nsixteen  component  parts  and  manufactured  and  assembled\n\nvirtually all the components.   The Snows counter that  they\n\nhave  presented evidence  showing the  crane  is a  standard\n\ndesign and the trolley  was previously designed for  sale in\n\nFlorida.  \n\n          The   Snows'    evidence,   which    consists   of\n\nHarnischfeger's brochures and  literature along with  expert\n\naffidavits  and deposition  testimony,  does not  create any\n\ngenuine issue  of fact for  trial.  The  brochures emphasize\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nthat  customers should  avoid  \"standard\" cranes  and should\n\nhave  Harnischfeger's  experts  design  a  crane  that  will\n\nsatisfy their  particular needs.   At  best, the  literature\n\nsuggests Harnischfeger  has standardized the  materials used\n\nto create the  crane and standardized certain  components to\n\nbe mixed and matched into a final product.  In addition, the\n\nopinions  of  Snows'  experts  that the  crane,  as  a final\n\nproduct, is a  basic design similar to cranes  used in other\n\nindustries  do not  contradict Harnischfeger's evidence.   A\n\ncrane   can  be  designed  for  a  particular  location  and\n\nspecialized  function   and  still   retain  the   essential\n\ncharacteristics common to industrial  cranes.  Moreover, the\n\nability  of the  crane  to  be adopted  for  use by  another\n\nindustry  is  immaterial  to  Harnischfeger's  status  as  a\n\nprotected actor  because the relevant  inquiry involves  the\n\nmotivation behind and the activity of producing the product,\n\nnot the product  itself.  See Dighton v.  Federal Pac. Elec.\n                                                            \n\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">509</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 516  (Mass. 1987).   Furthermore,  the\n   \n\ndeposition  testimony  of  James  Fravert,  a  Harnischfeger\n\nemployee, does  not establish that  the design of  the RESCO\n\ntrolley was the same as one previously used by Harnischfeger\n\nfor  sale to  Brevard  County, Florida.    Fravert does  not\n\ntestify  that the design was duplicated,  only that a design\n                        \n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\ndrawing  was  duplicated  and  the  duplicated  drawing  was\n       \n\nmodified to create the drawing for the RESCO crane.  \n\n          Lastly, the Snows raise the issue of the status of\n\nthe crane,  arguing first that  there is a genuine  issue of\n\nfact  as to  whether the  crane  is an  improvement to  real\n\nproperty.  Once again, however, the Snows do not dispute any\n\nrelevant  facts but rather  the application of  law to these\n\nfacts.     The   parties   agree   as   to   the   essential\n\ncharacteristics of the crane.  There is an established legal\n\nstandard  defining improvements  for purposes  of  M.G.L. c.\n\n260,     2B  as  well  as case  law  establishing  when  the\n\ndefinition  should be  applied.   See  Milligan v.  Tibbetts\n                                                            \n\nEng'g  Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  811  (Mass. 1984)  (adopting\n            \n\ndefinition   found   in    Webster's   Third   International\n\nDictionary);   see  also     Dighton,  506  N.E.2d   at  516\n                                    \n\n(explaining when definition  is useful).  The  Snows suggest\n\nno disputed  facts that  would in any  way preclude  us from\n\napplying the legal standard.\n\n          The Snows also  argue there is a genuine  issue of\n\nfact as to  whether the crane is  a permanent fixture.   The\n\nSJC has rejected adoption of a fixture analysis to determine\n\napplicability of the  statute of repose, noting  the statute\n\n\"makes  no reference to `fixtures,' nor  does it appear that\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nthe Legislature intended,  by its choice of the  common term\n\n`improvement,'  to subsume  that tangle of  highly technical\n\nmeanings, often distinct in diverse legal contexts, which is\n\nthe law  of fixtures.\"  Dighton, 506 F.2d  at 515.  The fact\n                               \n\nthat a product is affixed, permanently or otherwise, neither\n\nmakes the product an improvement nor turns the producer into\n\na protected  actor.   Id.   Thus,  the crane's  status as  a\n                         \n\npermanent fixture is immaterial to our inquiry.  \n\nHarnischfeger as a Protected Actor\n                                  \n\n          The Snows  further challenge the  summary judgment\n\norder by maintaining the  district court acted impermissibly\n\nand   without   precedent  in   applying   the   statute  to\n\nHarnischfeger,  who  they  define  as  \"manufacturers  of  a\n\nmachine.\"  The Snows argue Harnischfeger, as a manufacturer,\n\nis outside  the class  of  actors M.G.L.  c.  260,    2B  is\n\ndesigned  to   protect.    Harnischfeger  admits  to  having\n\nmanufactured the crane but argues a manufacturer who engages\n\nin protected activities is entitled to repose.\n\n          The  purpose  of   the  statute  is  \"to   protect\n\nproviders   of    `individual   expertise'\"    who   \"render\n\nparticularized services  for the design  and construction of\n\nparticular  improvements   to  particular  pieces   of  real\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nproperty.\"   Id.   The  statute  does not  name a  class  of\n                \n\nprotected actors, but  instead extends protection  to \"those\n\nwho  commit  `any  deficiency  or  neglect  in  the  design,\n\nplanning,  construction,  or  general administration  of  an\n\nimprovement to real property.'\"  Id. at 514.  Certain actors\n                                    \n\nobviously fall within  the statute.  See id. at  516.  These\n                                            \n\nactors  include   architects,  engineers   and  contractors.\n\nKlein, 437 N.E.2d at 523.   The statute shields these actors\n     \n\nfrom  any liability  after six  years as  long as  they were\n\ninvolved  in an  enumerated  activity  with  respect  to  an\n\nimprovement  to  real  property.    Other  actors,  such  as\n\nmaterialmen and \"mere\"  suppliers, are outside the  scope of\n\nthe statute  and not entitled  to its protection.

See\n                                                            \n\nDighton,  506 N.E.2d  at 514.   A  party is not  a protected\n       \n\nactor when the  party does not perform protected  acts.  See\n                                                            \n\nid. at 515.   Conversely, an actor such as a manufacturer or\n   \n\nsupplier may be protected if  that actor becomes more than a\n\n\"mere\"  supplier   by  engaging  in   protected  activities.\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\nMcDonough,  591 N.E.2d  at  1082 (manufacturer  who designed\n         \n\nbleacher units specifically for the  rink in which they were\n\ninstalled by another is more than mere supplier and entitled\n\nto benefit of statute).  Thus, application of the statute is\n\nnecessarily  dependent   on  the   nature  of   the  party's\n\nactivities.7  See Dighton, 506 N.E.2d at 516.  \n                         \n\n          In  Dighton, the defendant  did not claim  to have\n                     \n\nprovided  particularized   services  with  respect   to  the\n\nimprovement  -- the  building  --  but  rather  claimed  the\n\n                    \n\n7The Snows argue that Dighton imposes a requirement upon the\n                             \ncourt to engage in a  two-step analysis to determine whether\nHarnischfeger  is protected  under  M.G.L.  c.  260,     2B.\nAccording  to the  Snows,  Dighton  requires  the  court  to\n                                  \nconsider whether  the statute names the party as a protected\nactor, i.e.,  an architect  or engineer.   If the  answer is\nyes, the court  may determine whether the  defendant engaged\nin protected acts.  \n          Dighton imposes no  such test.  The  Dighton court\n                                                      \nmerely noted  that the  trial judge  framed the question  in\nthis bipartite form.  506 N.E.2d at 514.  The court rejected\nthe bipartite formulation:\n\n          On its  face,   2B defines the protected\n          actor largely by  reference to protected\n          acts.  The body  of   2B names  no class\n          of protected actors.  Rather, its  terms\n          extend protection  to persons  allegedly\n          responsible  for acts,  i.e., those  who\n          commit \"any deficiency or neglect in the\n          design,   planning,   construction,   or\n          general administration of an improvement\n          to real property.\"\n\nId.   Thus, the court can  and must engage in  an activities\n   \nanalysis when the defendant's status as a protected actor is\nunclear.  See id.\n                 \n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nbenefit  of  the  statute as  a  designer,  manufacturer and\n\nsupplier   of  a   component  that  fell   within  Webster's\n\ndefinition of improvement.8   Id. at 515, 516.   The SJC did\n                                 \n\nnot reject the contention that a producer of a component may\n\nbe  entitled  to protection.    See  id.  at 516;  see  also\n                                                            \n\nMcDonough, 591 N.E.2d at 1084.   Instead, the SJC rejected a\n         \n\nformalistic   inquiry   and   established   the   producer's\n\nmotivations and activities as the relevant focus of inquiry,\n\nnot the nature of  the product or the ability to  define the\n\nproduct as an improvement or a fixture.  Dighton, 506 N.E.2d\n                                                \n\nat 516.\n\n          In considering whether an actor not clearly within\n\nthe statute  is entitled to  repose, the court engages  in a\n\nfact-based activities  analysis.  See  id.   The court  must\n                                          \n\nconsider  the motivation  of  the  actor  in  producing  the\n\nimprovement.9   Id.   If the actor  designed the improvement\n                   \n\n                    \n\n8This  definition has  been  adopted by  the  SJC where  the\ndefendant's status as  a protected  actor is  not in  doubt.\nId. at 516.\n   \n\n9The SJC provides the following illustration:\n\n               [I]f  a  piece of  metal  sculpture\n          were  welded to an  exposed girder  in a\n          building,   it   certainly    could   be\n          characterized as  a \"permanent  addition\n          to or betterment  of\" the property,  one\n          \"enhanc[ing]  it  capital   value,\"  one\n          \"involv[ing] the expenditure of labor or\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nfor  public sale or  for general use, then  the actor is not\n\nprotected because  the actor is  engaged in the  activity of\n\ncreating  a  fungible product.    See id.  If,  however, the\n                                         \n\nimprovement is produced for a  particular project and to the\n\nspecifications of  an architect  or an  engineer, M.G.L.  c.\n\n260,    2B may protect the  actor as someone engaged  in the\n\nactivity of designing a particularized improvement.

RESCO intended the cranes to be\n\na permanent and integral  part of the overall  plant, making\n\nthe property  useful.   Harnischfeger was  not motivated  to\n\ncreate a fungible crane available to a variety of buyers and\n\nappropriate for  incorporation into a number  of facilities.\n\nHarnischfeger's  actions  conform to  those outlined  by the\n\nDighton Court and are protected activities.10  \n       \n\n          As  the plaintiffs  note,  \"[w]hen faced  with the\n\nquestion of  whether  or not  the defendant  is entitled  to\n\nrepose under  M.G.L. c. 260    2B, the first question  to be\n\nanswered is `Is the defendant a protected actor under M.G.L.\n\nc. 260    2B?'\"   Brief of the Plaintiffs-Appellants  at 11.\n\n                    \n\n10As the Snows'  experts note, a subsequent  purchaser could\nremove  and modify  the  RESCO  cranes  for use  in  another\nindustry, although  this contingency was neither  Rust's nor\nHarnischfeger's intention.

[T]he local law on  this\n\nquestion has  not been  clearly determined.\"11   Plaintiffs-\n\nAppellants' Memorandum in Support of their Motion to Certify\n\nQuestions of  Local Law  to  the Supreme  Judicial Court  of\n\nMassachusetts at 2.\n\n          Certification   of    determinative   issues    is\n\nappropriate  where \"it appears to the certifying court there\n\nis no controlling precedent in the decisions  of the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court.\"   Supreme  Judicial Court  Rule  1:03,    1\n\n(1986).  The SJC construed the scope  of M.G.L. c. 260,   2B\n\nin a number of cases.   See, e.g., McDonough, 591 N.E.2d  at\n                                            \n\n1084  (repose  extends   to  designer   of  bleacher   units\n\nspecifically  designed for rink); Parent v.

The Snows themselves  list in their motion\n\nfor certification no less than ten cases where Massachusetts\n\ncourts  have determined whether  a defendant is  a protected\n\nactor under M.G.L. c. 260,    2B.  Massachusetts courts have\n\nalso  extensively  addressed  when  Webster's definition  of\n\nimprovement is to  be utilized.  See Dighton,  506 N.E.2d at\n                                            \n\n516;   Milligan, 461  N.E.2d at 811;  Raffel, 437  N.E.2d at\n                                            \n\n1085.
