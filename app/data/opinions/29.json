Rule 10b-5(b), promulgated by the\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the aegis of section\n\n10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act),\n\nrenders it unlawful \"[t]o make any untrue statement of a material\n\nfact   .   .    .   in   connection   with    the   purchase   or   sale   of   any\n\nsecurity.\"       17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b).          The issue before us is one\n\nof first impression.         It turns on the meaning of the word \"make\" as\n\nused in Rule 10b-5(b).         The SEC advocates an expansive definition,\n\ncontending that one may \"make\" a statement within the purview of\n\nthe rule by merely using or disseminating a statement without\n\nregard to the authorship of that statement or, in the alternative,\n\nthat securities professionals who direct the offering and sale of\n\nshares on behalf of an underwriter impliedly \"make\" a statement,\n\ncovered by the rule, to the effect that the disclosures in a\n\nprospectus are truthful and complete.\n\n               We reject the SEC's expansive interpretation.                It is\n\ninconsistent with the text of the rule and with the ordinary\n\nmeanings of the phrase \"to make a statement,\" inconsistent with the\n\nstructure of the rule and relevant statutes, and in considerable\n\ntension with Supreme Court precedent.               Consequently, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of the SEC's Rule 10b-5(b) claim.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n               Because this appeal follows the district court's granting\n\nof a motion to dismiss, we rehearse the facts as well-pleaded in\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthe SEC's complaint.          See Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v.\n\nFeliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             At all times material hereto (roughly, 1998-2003), the\n\ndefendants, James Tambone and Robert Hussey, were senior executives\n\nof a registered broker-dealer, Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc.\n\n(Columbia Distributor), or its predecessor in interest.          Columbia\n\nDistributor underwrites and markets mutual funds.       The SEC alleges\n\nthat   the   defendants   violated    sundry   provisions   of   both   the\n\nSecurities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Exchange Act.            Its\n\ncomplaint depicts a tangled web of interlocking entities.                 We\n\nbriefly trace the fibers within that web.\n\n             During the relevant period, Columbia Distributor was a\n\nwholly-owned     subsidiary    of   Columbia   Management   Group,      Inc.\n\n(Columbia Management) and an indirect subsidiary of FleetBoston\n\nFinancial Corporation (Fleet).       Columbia Distributor was known as\n\nLiberty Funds Distributor, Inc. (Liberty Distributor) until 2001,\n\nwhen Fleet purchased its parent corporation, Liberty Financial\n\nGroup (Liberty).\n\n             Columbia Distributor acted as the principal underwriter\n\nand distributor of over 140 mutual funds in the Columbia mutual\n\nfund complex (the Columbia Funds).         The Columbia Funds included\n\nseveral funds that had been owned by Liberty prior to the take-over\n\nby Fleet.    In its wonted role, Columbia Distributor sold shares in\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthe   Columbia    Funds   and     disseminated       their   prospectuses      to\n\ninvestors.\n\n           Direct responsibility for the representations contained\n\nin the prospectuses rested with the funds' sponsor, Columbia\n\nManagement    Advisors,      Inc.,   and    its    predecessors    in    interest\n\n(collectively, Columbia Advisors).                Like Columbia Distributor,\n\nColumbia   Advisors    was    a   wholly-owned       subsidiary    of    Columbia\n\nManagement and, thus, an indirect subsidiary of Fleet for much of\n\nthe relevant period.\n\n           The defendants held positions of trust and responsibility\n\nin this corporate pyramid.           Tambone served as co-president of\n\nColumbia Distributor from 2001 to 2004. Prior thereto, he held the\n\nsame post with Liberty Distributor.               Hussey served as managing\n\ndirector (national accounts) of Columbia Distributor from 2002\n\nuntil 2004.      Before that, he occupied a comparable position with\n\nLiberty Distributor. The SEC does not allege that either defendant\n\nworked for the Columbia Funds' sponsor, Columbia Advisors, during\n\nthe relevant time frame.\n\n           The    short-term      trading    practice    that     lies   at   the\n\nepicenter of this case is known in the trade as \"market timing.\"\n\nMarket timing is the practice of frequent buying and selling of\n\nshares of a single mutual fund in order to exploit inefficiencies\n\nin mutual fund pricing.           According to the SEC, market timing,\n\nthough not illegal per se, can harm other fund investors and,\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\ftherefore, is commonly barred (or at least restricted) by those in\n\ncharge of mutual funds.\n\n          The     Columbia     Funds'         prospectuses      contained\n\nrepresentations   touching   upon    the    subject   of   market   timing.\n\nStarting at least as early as 1998, language was inserted into many\n\nColumbia Funds' prospectuses restricting the number and frequency\n\nof round-trips (i.e., exchanges from one fund to another and back\n\nagain) in which an investor could indulge.            Emblematic of this\n\nprophylaxis was language, first appearing in May of 1999, inserted\n\nin prospectuses for funds belonging to the Acorn Fund Group, a\n\nconstituent of the Columbia Funds.         That language stated that the\n\nfunds within the group \"do not permit market-timing and have\n\nadopted policies to discourage this practice.\"\n\n          This effort to curb market timing escalated over time.\n\nIn 2000, Hussey co-chaired an internet working group formed to\n\ncreate procedures designed to detect and deter market timing in the\n\nColumbia Funds. The working group ultimately recommended that each\n\nof the member funds take a consistent position against market\n\ntiming in future prospectuses.        As a result, a number of funds\n\nbegan to include a \"strict prohibition\" in every prospectus,\n\nexpressly barring short-term or excessive trading.           By 2003, the\n\nstrict prohibition language, or a variant of it, appeared in all\n\nthe Columbia Funds' prospectuses.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f             The    SEC   alleges   that,     despite     the   language    in   the\n\nprospectuses       expressing     hostility    toward     market   timing    —   the\n\nexistence of which Tambone and Hussey allegedly either knew or\n\nrecklessly ignored — the defendants jointly and severally entered\n\ninto, approved, and/or knowingly permitted arrangements allowing\n\ncertain preferred customers to engage in market timing forays in at\n\nleast sixteen different Columbia Funds during the relevant period.\n\nThe SEC also alleges that the defendants used the prospectuses in\n\ntheir     sales    efforts   by   allowing    them   to   be    disseminated     and\n\nreferring potential clients to them.\n\nII.   TRAVEL OF THE CASE\n\n             On May 19, 2006, the SEC filed a civil complaint in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.1\n\nIn its complaint, the SEC alleged that Tambone and Hussey had\n\nviolated section 17(a) of the Securities Act, section 10(b) of the\n\nExchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.                  In addition, the SEC\n\nalleged     that    the   defendants    had    aided      and   abetted     primary\n\nviolations of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by Columbia Advisors and\n\nColumbia Distributor, primary violations of section 15(c) of the\n\nExchange Act by Columbia Distributor, and primary violations of\n\nsection 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 80b-6, by Columbia Advisors.\n\n\n      1\n       An earlier action, filed in February of 2005, was dismissed\nwithout prejudice for failure to plead fraud with particularity.\nThat action is of no moment here.\n\n                                       -7-\n\f                 In due season, each defendant moved to dismiss.                   The SEC\n\nopposed the motions.             As the parties' arguments with respect to\n\nliability under Rule 10b-5(b) are central to this appeal, we\n\nsummarize them succinctly.\n\n                 The defendants premised their challenge on the thesis\n\nthat       the    SEC    had    failed       properly   to    plead      any   actionable\n\nmisstatements on their part. In opposition, the SEC countered that\n\nthe complaint sufficiently alleged that the defendants had made\n\nmaterial misrepresentations regarding market timing in the Columbia\n\nFunds'      prospectuses.             Specifically,     the   SEC     argued    that   the\n\ndefendants \"made\" false statements of material facts within the\n\nmeaning of Rule 10b-5(b) by (i) participating in the drafting\n\nprocess      that       went   into    the    development     of   the    market   timing\n\nlanguage,2 and (ii) using the prospectuses in their sales efforts,\n\nallowing the prospectuses to be disseminated and referring clients\n\nto them          for information.3           Finally, the SEC argued that the\n\ndefendants were liable for a material omission under Rule 10b-5(b).\n\n\n\n       2\n       This contention was based on the SEC's allegations that the\ndefendants reviewed and commented on the market timing statements\nbefore those statements were included in the prospectuses. We do\nnot quote these allegations at length, as the SEC has not pursued\nthis line of argument on appeal.\n       3\n       In addition, the SEC argued that Tambone had made material\nmisrepresentations by signing selling agreements in which he\nvouched for the accuracy of the statements in the prospectuses.\nBecause the SEC has not pursued this argument on appeal, we\ndisregard it. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\nCir. 1990).\n\n                                               -8-\n\f            The district court granted the motions to dismiss.                    SEC\n\nv. Tambone (Tambone I), 473 F. Supp. 2d 162, 168 (D. Mass. 2006).\n\nWith respect to the Rule 10b-5(b) claim premised on the defendants'\n\nmaking of false statements, the court applied the bright-line test\n\narticulated in Wright v. Ernst & Young LLP, 152 F.3d 169, 175 (2d\n\nCir.    1998),     and    held   that    the    SEC's   allegations       about   the\n\ndefendants'      participation      in    the    drafting     process     and   their\n\nsubsequent    use    of    the   prospectuses        were    too     conclusory   and\n\nattenuated to satisfy the particularity requirement of Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 9(b).          Tambone I, 473 F. Supp. 2d at 166.              The\n\ncourt found unconvincing the SEC's other arguments for liability\n\nunder Rule 10b-5.         Id. at 167.       The court likewise rejected the\n\nSEC's section 17(a) and aiding and abetting claims. Id. at 167-68.\n\n            The SEC appealed from the granting of the motions to\n\ndismiss with respect to its section 17(a)(2), Rule 10b-5(b), and\n\naiding and abetting claims.\n\n            With respect to Rule 10b-5(b), the SEC briefed two\n\narguments     as     to    how    the     defendants        \"made\"     the    alleged\n\nmisrepresentations.          First, the SEC argued that the defendants\n\n\"made\" the misrepresentations by using the prospectuses to sell the\n\nmutual funds. Second, the SEC argued that the defendants impliedly\n\nmade false representations to investors to the effect that they had\n\na reasonable basis for believing that the key representations in\n\nthe    prospectuses       were   truthful      and   complete.         This   implied\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fstatement    theory   rested   on   the    premise   that   a   securities\n\nprofessional engaged in the offering of securities has a \"special\n\nduty\" to undertake an investigation that would provide him with a\n\nreasonable basis for believing that the representations in the\n\nprospectus are truthful and complete.       Therefore, the theory goes,\n\na securities professional \"makes\" an implied representation to\n\ninvestors that the prospectus is truthful and complete when he\n\nengages in an offering.\n\n            What the SEC chose not to argue is also noteworthy.        The\n\nSEC did not allude to its argument, which at one point had been\n\nraised below, that the defendants made the alleged misstatements\n\nthrough their involvement with the preparation of the prospectuses.\n\nSimilarly, although the SEC had pleaded violations of subparagraphs\n\n(a) and (c) of Rule 10b-5, it did not pursue those claims on\n\nappeal. In accordance with our usual praxis, we deem abandoned all\n\narguments that have not been briefed and developed on appeal.          See\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            A divided panel of this court reversed the dismissal of\n\nthe SEC's section 17(a)(2), Rule 10b-5(b), and aiding and abetting\n\nclaims.   SEC v. Tambone (Tambone II), 550 F.3d 106, 149 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (withdrawn).4     With respect to Rule 10b-5(b), the panel\n\nmajority adopted the SEC's implied representation theory and held\n\n\n     4\n      The panel parted ways only with respect to the Rule 10b-5(b)\nclaims. See Tambone II, 550 F.3d at 149 (Selya, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part).\n\n                                    -10-\n\fthat the SEC had thereby alleged that the defendants had made false\n\nstatements.     Id. at 135.\n\n           The defendants filed petitions for en banc review, Fed.\n\nR. App. P. 35, challenging all of the panel's holdings.             The full\n\ncourt withdrew the panel opinion but ordered rehearing en banc only\n\non the Rule 10b-5(b) issues.     SEC v. Tambone, 573 F.3d 54, 55 (1st\n\nCir. 2009) (order granting rehearing en banc).          The court declined\n\nto rehear the parties' arguments concerning either the section\n\n17(a)(2) or the aiding and abetting rulings.           Id.   Following a new\n\nround of briefing (including helpful submissions by an array of\n\namici) and reargument, we took the matter under advisement.\n\nIII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n           We review de novo a district court's disposition of a\n\nmotion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\nCentro Medico del Turabo, 406 F.3d at 5.       In the process, we accept\n\nas true all well-pleaded facts set out in the complaint and indulge\n\nall reasonable inferences in favor of the pleader.            In re Colonial\n\nMortg. Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           As a general proposition, a complaint must contain no\n\nmore than \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that\n\nthe pleader is entitled to relief.\"       Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).       But\n\neven   though    a   complaint   need    not   plead    \"detailed    factual\n\nallegations,\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007),\n\nit must nonetheless \"contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\ftrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\"\n\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (internal quotation\n\nmarks    omitted).       In   other   words,      the   complaint    must     include\n\n\"factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable\n\ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"\n\nId.     If the factual allegations in the complaint are too meager,\n\nvague, or conclusory to remove the possibility of relief from the\n\nrealm of mere conjecture, the complaint is open to dismissal.\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555.\n\n            Because the complaint in this case contains allegations\n\nof fraud, an additional hurdle must be surmounted: the pleader\n\n(here, the SEC) must \"state with particularity the circumstances\n\nconstituting [the] fraud.\"         Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).          To satisfy this\n\nparticularity requirement, the pleader must set out the \"time,\n\nplace,     and    content     of   the    alleged       misrepresentation        with\n\nspecificity.\"         Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 193\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\nIV.   ANALYSIS\n\n            This case presents the two-part question of whether a\n\nsecurities professional can be said to \"make\" a statement, such\n\nthat liability under Rule 10b-5(b) may attach, either by (i) using\n\nstatements       to   sell    securities,       regardless   of     whether    those\n\nstatements were crafted entirely by others, or (ii) directing the\n\noffering and sale of securities on behalf of an underwriter, thus\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fmaking an implied statement that he has a reasonable basis to\n\nbelieve that the key representations in the relevant prospectus are\n\ntruthful and complete.   The answer to each part of this two-part\n\nquestion is \"no.\"\n\n          We think it appropriate to commence our analysis with the\n\ntext of the relevant statute and rule.    See Cent. Bank of Denver v.\n\nFirst Interstate Bank of Denver, 511 U.S. 164, 173 (1994). Section\n\n10(b) of the Exchange Act renders it unlawful for a person \"[t]o\n\nuse or employ . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or\n\ncontrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the\n\n[SEC] may prescribe.\"     15 U.S.C. § 78j(b).       Pursuant to its\n\nrulemaking authority under section 10(b), the SEC adopted Rule 10b-\n\n5(b), which provides, in pertinent part, that \"[i]t shall be\n\nunlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, . . . [t]o make\n\nany untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a\n\nmaterial fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in\n\nthe light of the circumstances under which they were made, not\n\nmisleading.\"   17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b).    The inquiry here centers\n\non whether the defendants made untrue statements of material fact\n\nwithin the meaning of this rule.\n\n          In conducting this inquiry, the pivotal word in the\n\nrule's text is \"make,\" as in \"to make a statement.\"         The rule\n\nitself does not define that word, nor does it suggest that the word\n\nis imbued with any exotic meaning.       In the absence of either a\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fbuilt-in definition or some reliable indicium that the drafters\n\nintended a special nuance, accepted canons of construction teach\n\nthat the word should be given its ordinary meaning.                   See Smith v.\n\nUnited States, 508 U.S. 223, 228 (1993) (\"When a word is not\n\ndefined by statute, we normally construe it in accord with its\n\nordinary or natural meaning.\"); Santa Fe Indus., Inc. v. Green, 430\n\nU.S. 462, 472 (1977) (interpreting Rule 10b-5 according to the\n\n\"commonly accepted meaning\" of its words); In re Hill, 562 F.3d 29,\n\n32 (1st Cir. 2009) (noting that, in general, words in a statute\n\ncarry their ordinary meanings if not specially defined).\n\n           One reference point for determining the ordinary meaning\n\nof a word is its accepted dictionary definition. See, e.g., Smith,\n\n508 U.S. at 228-29 (consulting various dictionaries to discern the\n\nplain meaning of the word \"use\" in the relevant statute).                           For\n\npurposes   of   this   analysis,       we    refer    to    several    common       and\n\nrepresentative dictionary definitions of \"make,\" which include\n\n\"create [or] cause,\" Webster's Third New Int'l Dict. 1363 (2002);\n\n\"compose,\" id.; and \"cause (something) to exist,\" Black's Law Dict.\n\n1041 (9th ed. 2009).\n\n           This   case       does    not    require    us     to    set     forth    a\n\ncomprehensive test for determining when a speaker may be said to\n\nhave made a statement.              It is enough to say that the SEC's\n\npurported reading of the word is inconsistent with each of these\n\ndefinitions.      In   any    event,       the   question    does     not   turn    on\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fdictionary meanings alone.         We also look to the structure of\n\nsection 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, as well as other, related provisions,\n\nto interpret the term at issue.            Chief among these structural\n\nconsiderations is the relationship between section 10(b) and Rule\n\n10b-5(b).     Section    10(b)   grants    the   SEC   broad   authority   to\n\nproscribe conduct that \"use[s] or employ[s]\" any \"manipulative or\n\ndeceptive device or contrivance,\" in connection with the purchase\n\nor sale of any security.       15 U.S.C. § 78j(b).\n\n            In Rule 10b-5(b), the SEC prohibited a specific subset of\n\nall   \"manipulative     or   deceptive    device[s]    or   contrivance[s],\"\n\nnamely, untrue or misleading statements of material fact.                  It\n\nlikewise prohibited a specific subset of all conduct that might be\n\nsaid to \"use or employ\" such a manipulative device or contrivance:\n\nthe making of untrue or misleading statements of material fact.\n\n            In light of this deliberate word choice (\"make\"), the\n\nSEC's asseveration that one can \"make\" a statement when he merely\n\nuses a statement created entirely by others cannot follow.              That\n\nasseveration ignores the obvious distinction between the verbs\n\ncontained in the statute (\"use,\" \"employ\") and the significantly\n\ndifferent (and narrower) verb contained in Rule 10b-5(b) (\"make\").\n\nWord choices have consequences, and this word choice virtually\n\nleaps off the page.      There is no principled way that we can treat\n\nit as meaningless.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f            Section 10(b) is helpful to our analysis in another way\n\nas well.      That provision conferred upon the SEC authority to\n\nprohibit the \"use or employ[ment]\" of any manipulative device or\n\ncontrivance       in   connection   with   the   purchase    or   sale   of   any\n\nsecurity.    The SEC knew how to wield this authority and proscribe\n\n\"use or employ[ment]\" of a manipulative device or contrivance: in\n\nRule 10b-5(a), it did just that, rendering it unlawful \"to employ\"\n\na device, scheme, or artifice to defraud.           See 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-\n\n5(a).      That    the    SEC   wrote   this   prohibition   in   a   different\n\nsubparagraph of the rule and selected a more inclusive verb is a\n\ntelling combination. The Supreme Court remarked on this phenomenon\n\nin Affiliated Ute v. United States, 406 U.S. 128 (1972), observing\n\nthat:\n\n            [T]he   second   subparagraph   of  the   rule\n            specifies the making of an untrue statement of\n            a material fact and the omission to state a\n            material   fact.      The  first   and   third\n            subparagraphs are not so restricted.\n\nId. at 152-53.           It is not the judiciary's proper province to\n\nrewrite an administrative rule to sweep more broadly than its\n\nlanguage permits.         Thus, we must honor the limitation that the\n\ndrafters deliberately built into Rule 10b-5(b).\n\n            In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\nSEC suggests that the broad language of the statute (\"use or\n\nemploy\") requires an equally broad construction of the wording\n\ncontained in Rule 10b-5(b).         To support this suggestion, it touts\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fthe Supreme Court's statement that \"[t]he scope of Rule 10b-5 is\n\ncoextensive with the coverage of § 10(b).\"           SEC v. Zandford, 535\n\nU.S. 813, 816 n.1 (2002).          On that basis, the SEC posits that\n\n\"make\" must include \"use\" because the statute prohibits \"use\" and\n\nthe rule perforce must prohibit all that the statute prohibits.\n\n              This   argument   comprises   more   cry   than   wool.      Most\n\nnotably, it fails to account for an abecedarian point: even if Rule\n\n10b-5 is coextensive with the coverage of section 10(b), that\n\nsupposed verity does not mean that each of the subparagraphs of\n\nRule 10b-5, taken singly, is itself coextensive with the coverage\n\nof section 10(b).         That cannot be so.        If it was, then each\n\nsubparagraph would proscribe exactly the same conduct.                  They do\n\nnot.       See, e.g., Finkel v. Docutel/Olivetti Corp., 817 F.2d 356,\n\n359-60 (5th Cir. 1987).\n\n              Our view of the meaning of Rule 10b-5(b) is reinforced\n\nwhen we contrast the language of the rule with that of section\n\n17(a) of the Securities Act.       By way of background, the phrasing of\n\nRule 10b-5 largely mirrors the language of section 17(a) of the\n\nSecurities Act.5       That is not happenstance; the drafters of Rule\n\n\n       5\n           That section provides in pertinent part:\n\n       It shall be unlawful for any person . . ., directly or\n       indirectly\n\n       (1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,\n       or\n\n       (2) to obtain money or property by means of any untrue\n\n                                     -17-\n\f10b-5 modeled the rule on section 17(a).              See United States v.\n\nPersky, 520 F.2d 283, 287 (2d Cir. 1975).           But there is a salient\n\ndifference between the language of the rule and the language of\n\nsection 17(a) with respect to the types of conduct that may render\n\na person liable for a false statement.            Section 17(a)(2) makes it\n\nunlawful \"to obtain money or property by means of any untrue\n\nstatement of a material fact,\" 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2), whereas Rule\n\n10b-5(b) makes it unlawful \"to make any untrue statement of a\n\nmaterial fact,\" 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b).\n\n           In short, the drafters of Rule 10b-5 had before them\n\nlanguage that would have covered the \"use\" of an untrue statement\n\nof   material   fact   (regardless    of    who   created   or   composed   the\n\nstatement).     The drafters easily could have copied that language.\n\nThey declined to do so.       Instead, the drafters — who faithfully\n\ntracked section 17(a) in other respects — deliberately eschewed the\n\nexpansive language of section 17(a)(2).\n\n           The import of this eschewal is clear: although section\n\n17(a)(2) may fairly be read to cover the \"use\" of an untrue\n\n\n\n      statement of a material fact or any omission to state a\n      material fact necessary in order to make the statements\n      made, in light of the circumstances under which they were\n      made, not misleading; or\n\n      (3) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of\n      business which operates or would operate as a fraud or\n      deceit upon the purchaser.\n\n15 U.S.C. §     77q(a).\n\n                                     -18-\n\fstatement to obtain money or property, see, e.g., Edward J. Mawod\n\n& Co. v. SEC, 591 F.2d 588, 596 (10th Cir. 1979), Rule 10b-5(b) is\n\nmore narrowly crafted and its reach does not extend that far.6                           We\n\nmust honor the drafters' deliberate decision to insert the word\n\n\"make\" in Rule 10b-5(b) in lieu of the more expansive phrase \"by\n\nmeans of.\"          See United States v. Ahlers, 305 F.3d 54, 59-60 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (discussing court's obligation to \"presume that . . .\n\ndifferential draftsmanship was deliberate\").\n\n              The     SEC's         other     arguments      for   defining    \"make\"   to\n\nencompass      \"use\"       with      respect     to   Rule    10b-5(b)   liability      are\n\nunavailing.          One of the SEC's main arguments appears to be that\n\n\"[i]t seems self-evident that any statute or rule that prohibits\n\nmaking a false statement in connection with the sale of property\n\nwould       cover    a     seller      who     knowingly      uses    misleading    sales\n\nmaterials.\"         This type of abstract, decontextualized approach to\n\nthe interpretation of a statute or regulation is ill-suited to the\n\nconstruction          of      a     rule    laden     with     over   sixty    years     of\n\ninterpretation           in       literally    hundreds      of    opinions.     This    is\n\nespecially so because the rule in question is an integral part of\n\nan extensive regulatory framework forged by Congress, the SEC, and\n\nthe federal courts.\n\n\n\n\n        6\n       The SEC has in fact brought a separate section 17(a)(2)\nclaim against the defendants in this case.   That claim is not\nbefore the en banc court.\n\n                                               -19-\n\f           At any rate, what the SEC now calls \"self-evident\" is not\n\nself-evident at all.      What does seem self-evident is that if the\n\nSEC intended to prohibit more than just the actual making of a\n\nfalse statement in Rule 10b-5(b), then it would not have employed\n\nthe solitary verb \"make\" in the text of the rule.7\n\n           There    is    another    reason        to   reject    the   SEC's\n\ninterpretation; it is in tension with Supreme Court precedent.\n\nUnder modern Supreme Court precedent dealing with Rule 10b-5, much\n\nturns on the distinction between primary and secondary violators.\n\nSee Cent. Bank, 511 U.S. at 191.           Although Central Bank did not\n\naddress   the   precise   issue   with     which   we   are   concerned,   the\n\ndefinition of \"make\" that we propose is compatible with Central\n\nBank as it holds the line between primary and secondary liability\n\nin a manner faithful to Central Bank.          We explain briefly.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       The SEC also endeavors to prop up its \"use\" theory of Rule\n10b-5(b) liability by referring to a venerable Fourth Circuit case\ndeciding, for venue purposes, whether a defendant violated a\nfederal mortgage fraud statute in West Virginia or in Pennsylvania.\nSee Reass v. United States, 99 F.2d 752, 755 (4th Cir. 1938).\n     The only reason the opinion has even an epsilon's worth of\nrelevance to the issue at hand is that the challenged statute\nrendered it unlawful to \"make[] any statement, knowing it to be\nfalse, for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of a\nFederal Home Loan Bank upon any application for loan.\" Id. at 752.\nBut the Reass court did not presume to act as a legal\nlexicographer, chiseling in stone a definition of \"make\" for all\ntime and for every purpose. The result in Reass proceeds from the\nsimple proposition that the statute could not be violated until the\ndefendant presented the misstatements to the bank \"upon . . .\napplication for a loan.\" Id. at 755.\n\n                                    -20-\n\f            The Exchange Act does not explicitly confer a private\n\nright of action for section 10(b) violations.              The Supreme Court\n\nnevertheless has found a private right of action to be implicit in\n\nthe statute and the implementing rule (Rule 10b-5).             Sup't of Ins.\n\nof N.Y. v. Bankers Life & Cas. Co., 404 U.S. 6, 13 n.9 (1971).\n\nThis right of action is not unbridled: private plaintiffs are\n\npermitted to bring suit under Rule 10b-5 against only \"primary\"\n\nviolators.     See Cent. Bank, 511 U.S. at 177-78.\n\n            In the wake of Central Bank, Congress amended section 20\n\nof the Exchange Act to clarify that the SEC may bring suit against\n\naiders   and   abetters,    that    is,   persons    who   knowingly   provide\n\nsubstantial assistance to primary violators of the securities laws.\n\nPub. L. 104-67, § 104, 109 Stat. 737, 757 (1995) (codified at 15\n\nU.S.C. § 78t(e)). Although the SEC has exhorted Congress to extend\n\nthe same right to private parties, see 4 Thomas Lee Hazen, The Law\n\nof Securities Regulation 506 n.31 (6th ed. 2009), Congress has not\n\ndone so.    Thus, Rule 10b-5's private right of action extends only\n\nto primary violations, not to secondary violations.               If Central\n\nBank's carefully drawn circumscription of the private right of\n\naction is not to be hollowed — and we do not think that it should\n\nbe — courts must be vigilant to ensure that secondary violations\n\nare   not   shoehorned     into    the    category   reserved   for    primary\n\nviolations.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f           The SEC's position poses a threat to the integrity of\n\nthis dichotomy.    Refined to bare essence, the SEC, through the\n\ninstrumentality of Rule 10b-5(b), seeks to impose primary liability\n\non the defendants for conduct that constitutes, at most, aiding and\n\nabetting (a secondary violation).         Allowing the SEC to blur the\n\nline between primary and secondary violations in this manner would\n\nbe unfaithful to the taxonomy of Central Bank.\n\n           Of course, the Central Bank Court did not purpose to\n\ndecide   the   precise   issue   before   us.    Withal,   the   Court's\n\nmethodology for determining the scope of the private right of\n\naction (and, thus, the scope of primary liability) is a beacon by\n\nwhich we must steer.     That methodology emphasizes fidelity to the\n\ntext of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.       See Cent. Bank, 511 U.S. at\n\n173 (explaining that a \"private plaintiff may not bring a 10b-5\n\nsuit against a defendant for acts not prohibited by the text of\n\n§ 10(b)\"); see also id. (\"We have refused to allow 10b-5 challenges\n\nto conduct not prohibited by the text of the statute.\").8             An\n\nexpansive reading of the rule, unmoored from its text and based on\n\njudicially manufactured policy rationales, is plainly antithetic to\n\n\n\n     8\n       Although the Central Bank Court focused its inquiry on\nsection 10(b), its methodology is equally applicable to Rule 10b-5.\nThe rule is incorporated into the statutory framework and, thus,\nits scope \"is coextensive with the coverage of § 10(b).\" Zandford,\n535 U.S. at 816 n.1.      Fidelity to the text of section 10(b)\nrequires fidelity to the text of Rule 10b-5 and, therefore,\nfidelity to the text of each of the subsections that comprise the\nrule.\n\n                                  -22-\n\fthis restrained methodology.    See id. at 188 (warning that, absent\n\nthe prospect of a bizarre result, policy considerations cannot\n\noverride the text and structure of the statute).\n\n          There is more.     Reading \"make\" to include the use of a\n\nfalse statement by one other than the maker would extend primary\n\nliability beyond the scope of conduct prohibited by the text of\n\nRule 10b-5(b).    See id.   Furthermore, doing so would \"add a gloss\n\nto the operative language of the [rule] quite different from its\n\ncommonly accepted meaning.\"    Id. at 174 (quoting Ernst & Ernst v.\n\nHochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 199 (1976)).     Allowing courts to imply\n\nthat \"X\" has made a false statement with only a factual allegation\n\nthat he passed along what someone else wrote would flout a core\n\nprinciple that underpins the Central Bank decision. We decline the\n\nSEC's invitation to go down that road.\n\n          As an aside, blurring the line between primary and\n\nsecondary violations also would create unacceptable tension with\n\nthe substantial body of case law that has evolved post-Central Bank\n\n— case law that maps the outer boundaries of primary liability\n\nunder Rule 10b-5.    This case law, though not directly on point,\n\ndoes not fit comfortably with the view that the SEC espouses here.\n\nLet us explain.\n\n          In the aftermath of Central Bank, several courts of\n\nappeals have had to plot the line between primary violations and\n\nmere aiding and abetting in Rule 10b-5 actions brought by private\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fplaintiffs.   Two divergent strains of authority have evolved.    We\n\nhave not yet chosen between these divergent strains and we have no\n\nneed to do so today.   It suffices to say that the line of authority\n\nmost hospitable to the establishment of primary violations of Rule\n\n10b-5 embraces the \"substantial participation\" test, under which a\n\nperson's \"substantial participation or intricate involvement in the\n\npreparation of fraudulent statements\" is enough to establish a\n\nprimary violation.     Howard v. Everex Sys., Inc., 228 F.3d 1057,\n\n1061 n.5 (9th Cir. 2000).      The other line of authority, less\n\nhospitable to plaintiffs, adheres to the \"bright-line\" test, under\n\nwhich a primary violation requires proof both that the defendant\n\nactually made a false or misleading statement and that it was\n\nattributable to him at the time of public dissemination.         See\n\nWright, 152 F.3d at 175; see also Ziemba v. Cascade Int'l, Inc.,\n\n256 F.3d 1194, 1205 (11th Cir. 2001); Anixter v. Home-Stake Prod.\n\nCo., 77 F.3d 1215, 1226 (10th Cir. 1996); In re Kendall Sq.\n\nResearch Corp. Sec. Litig., 868 F. Supp. 26, 28 n.2 (D. Mass.\n\n1994).\n\n          While these tests are designed for private litigation,\n\nand, thus, are poorly suited to public enforcement actions,9 one\n\n\n     9\n        For example, the bright-line test cannot be imported\nwholesale into the public enforcement context because its\nattribution prong reflects the need to prove reliance, see Wright,\n152 F.3d at 175 — an element that the SEC need not establish in a\nRule 10b-5 case. See Schellenbach v. SEC, 989 F.2d 907, 913 (7th\nCir. 1993); see also SEC v. Wolfson, 539 F.3d 1249, 1260 (10th Cir.\n2008) (declining to impose the attribution requirement in an SEC\n\n                                -24-\n\fthing is crystal clear.          The conduct for which the SEC strives to\n\nhold        the    defendants   as   primary   violators   —   the   use   and\n\ndissemination of prospectuses created by others — does not satisfy\n\neither test. Both tests focus, albeit to different degrees, on the\n\nactual role that a defendant played in creating, composing, or\n\ncausing the existence of an untrue statement of material fact. The\n\nSEC's attempt to impute statements to persons who may not have had\n\nany role in their creation, composition, or preparation falls well\n\nshort.10      As the Second Circuit put it: \"If Central Bank is to have\n\nany real meaning, a defendant must actually make a false or\n\nmisleading statement in order to be held liable [as a primary\n\nviolator] under section 10(b).           Anything short of such conduct is\n\nmerely aiding and abetting.\"          Shapiro v. Cantor, 123 F.3d 717, 720\n\n(2d Cir. 1997).\n\n                  There is yet another problem with the SEC's implied\n\nstatement theory: that theory effectively imposes upon securities\n\nprofessionals who work for underwriters an unprecedented duty.             We\n\nelaborate on this mischief below.\n\n                  The SEC notes, correctly, that securities professionals\n\nworking for underwriters have a duty to investigate the nature and\n\n\n\nenforcement action).\n       10\n       Although the SEC at one time argued that the defendants\n\"made\" untrue statements of material fact through some vaguely\ndescribed involvement in drafting the prospectuses, it has not\npursued that argument on appeal.\n\n                                       -25-\n\fcircumstances of an offering.           See, e.g., SEC v. Dain Rauscher,\n\nInc., 254 F.3d 852, 857 (D.C. Cir. 2001).                   Building on this\n\nfoundation, the SEC theorizes that such securities professionals\n\nimpliedly \"make\" a representation to investors that the statements\n\nin a prospectus are truthful and complete.              If we were to give\n\ncredence to this theory, the upshot would be to impose primary\n\nliability under Rule 10b-5(b) on these securities professionals\n\nwhenever they fail to disclose material information not included in\n\na prospectus, regardless of who prepared the prospectus.                   That\n\nwould be tantamount to imposing a free-standing and unconditional\n\nduty to disclose.      The imposition of such a duty flies in the teeth\n\nof Supreme Court precedent.\n\n             The key precedent is Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S.\n\n222    (1980).    It     instructs     that   a   party's   nondisclosure    of\n\ninformation to another is actionable under Rule 10b-5 only when\n\nthere is an independent duty to disclose the information arising\n\nfrom    \"a   fiduciary    or   other    similar    relation   of   trust    and\n\nconfidence\" between the parties.              Id. at 228.     As the Fourth\n\nCircuit explained, \"the duty to disclose material facts arises only\n\nwhen there is some basis outside the securities laws, such as state\n\nlaw, for finding a fiduciary or other confidential relationship.\"\n\nFortson v. Winstead, McGuire, Sechrest & Minick, 961 F.2d 469, 472\n\n(4th Cir. 1992); accord SEC v. Cochran, 214 F.3d 1261, 1264 (10th\n\nCir. 2000). Adopting the SEC's implied statement theory would pave\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fthe     way     for     suits   against     securities      professionals        for\n\nnondisclosure of material information without the required showing\n\nof a fiduciary relationship.          Fidelity to that requirement demands\n\nthat we reject the SEC's notion that a breach of a duty to\n\ninvestigate, without more, is a breach of a duty to disclose (and,\n\nthus, should be treated as a primary violation under Rule 10b-\n\n5(b)).\n\n              The SEC labors to depict its implied statement theory as\n\nfirmly rooted in both case law and longstanding administrative\n\ninterpretation.         This depiction is inaccurate.\n\n              As to case law, the SEC relies principally on three\n\ndecisions.      See Dolphin & Bradbury, Inc. v. SEC, 512 F.3d 634, 641\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2008); Sanders v. John Nuveen & Co., 524 F.2d 1064, 1070\n\n(7th Cir. 1975); Chris-Craft Indus., Inc. v. Piper Aircraft Corp.,\n\n480 F.2d 341, 370 (2d Cir. 1973).                 These decisions, it asserts,\n\nstand     for     the      linchpin   proposition       that   an     underwriter\n\nparticipating         in   an   offering     makes    an    implied   statement,\n\npotentially      actionable      under     Rule    10b-5(b),   that   he   has    a\n\nreasonable basis for believing that the prospectus is truthful and\n\ncomplete.\n\n              That assertion is incorrect.           To begin, neither Dolphin\n\nnor Sanders holds that an underwriter may be found liable as a\n\nprimary violator under Rule 10b-5(b) for \"making\" an implied\n\nrepresentation that proves to be false.                    Those cases did not\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\fpresent any issue as to whether the underwriter had \"made\" a\n\nstatement.    In fact, in both cases the underwriter personally made\n\nthe   misrepresentations.       See    Dolphin,    512    F.3d    at    638,   640;\n\nSanders, 524 F.2d at 1067; see also Sanders v. John Nuveen & Co.,\n\n619 F.2d 1222, 1234 (7th Cir. 1980).         Both decisions were directed\n\ntoward a wholly distinct issue: whether the defendant acted with\n\nthe required state of mind in making the statements.                  See Dolphin,\n\n512   F.3d   at   639;   Sanders,   524   F.2d    at   1066.      Any    language\n\nsuggesting     that   various   representations        might     be    imputed   to\n\nunderwriters must be viewed in this (very different) context.\n\n             Chris-Craft also fails to breathe life into the SEC's\n\nargument.      The case holds that an underwriter's constructive\n\nrepresentation that the statements made in registration materials\n\nare truthful and complete constitutes the making of a statement\n\nunder section 14(e) of the Exchange Act.11               See Chris-Craft, 480\n\nF.2d at 370.      But Chris-Craft preceded Central Bank by over twenty\n\nyears, and its continued vitality with respect to this section\n\n14(e) holding is doubtful.\n\n             In all events, nothing turned on the distinction between\n\nprimary and secondary violations at that time, so the Chris-Craft\n\n\n\n      11\n       That section provides in pertinent part that: \"[i]t shall\nbe unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a\nmaterial fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order\nto make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances\nunder which they are made, not misleading, . . . in connection with\nany tender offer.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78n(e).\n\n                                      -28-\n\fpanel had no reason to distinguish between them. In retrospect, it\n\nis reasonable to read Chris-Craft as holding that the underwriters\n\nwere liable only as secondary violators.                    See In re MTC Elec.\n\nTechs. S'holder Litig., 993 F. Supp. 160, 162 (E.D.N.Y. 1997)\n\n(concluding    that     \"the     holding       of   Chris-Craft   was   that   an\n\nunderwriter was liable as an aider and abettor\").\n\n          We     turn     next     to      the      array    of   administrative\n\npronouncements.    We freely accept the principle that the existence\n\nof a longstanding pattern of administrative interpretation might\n\nwell call for Chevron deference.                 See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.\n\nNatural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984).\n\nHere, however, the SEC's claim of a \"longstanding administrative\n\ninterpretation\" is wildly exaggerated.\n\n              The SEC has cobbled together a bricolage of agency\n\ndecisions and statements all of which antedate Central Bank.\n\nWithout exception, nothing in this carefully culled collection says\n\nthat an implied representation of an underwriter can constitute a\n\nbasis for primary liability under Rule 10b-5(b). The fact that the\n\nSEC has never before articulated the implied statement theory as a\n\nbasis for Rule 10b-5(b) liability dooms its quest for Chevron\n\ndeference.    After all, there is no occasion for Chevron deference\n\nwhen there is nothing to which a court may defer.\n\n          Before leaving this topic, we wish to comment briefly on\n\nthe dissent's metronomic reliance on the special role and duties of\n\n\n                                        -29-\n\funderwriters.     We agree that underwriters have a special niche in\n\nthe marketing of securities and, thus, have a special set of\n\nresponsibilities. But the duty that the dissent seeks to impose is\n\nunprecedented — and far exceeds the scope of Rule 10b-5(b).     While\n\nthat rule could have been drafted to cut a wider swath, it was not.\n\nThe SEC has other, more appropriate tools that it may use to police\n\nthe parade of horribilis that the dissent envisions, and it is\n\nneither necessary nor wise to attempt to expand the rule by\n\njudicial fiat.     Most importantly, doing so would, as a matter of\n\nlaw, be wrong.\n\n          There is one loose end, which relates to waiver. The SEC\n\nargues to the en banc court that the defendants can be held\n\nprimarily liable for violating Rule 10b-5(b) under an entanglement\n\ntest.   See, e.g., In re Cabletron Sys., Inc., 311 F.3d 11, 37-38\n\n(1st Cir. 2002); Elkind v. Liggett & Myers, Inc., 635 F.2d 156, 163\n\n(2d Cir. 1980).    Under this test, a defendant may be held primarily\n\nliable for misstatements appearing in reports authored by outside\n\nanalysts when those misrepresentations are based on information\n\nprovided by the defendant.     See Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 38.   Such\n\nliability inheres when \"defendants have expressly or impliedly\n\nadopted the statements, placed their imprimatur on the statements,\n\nor have otherwise entangled themselves with the analysts to a\n\nsignificant degree.\"    Id. at 37-38.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\f          This argument has not been preserved and, thus, need not\n\nconcern us.   The SEC did not advance it before the district court\n\nin connection with the dispositive motions to dismiss.   To make a\n\nbad situation worse, the SEC did not coherently present this\n\nargument before the panel during the first stage of this appeal.\n\nTo the contrary, the SEC's panel briefs were devoid not only of any\n\ndeveloped argumentation to the effect that the defendants entangled\n\nthemselves with the statements in the prospectuses but also of\n\ncitations to Cabletron, Elkind, or any comparable precedent.    In\n\nthis instance, silence speak volumes.\n\n          A party cannot switch horses mid-stream, changing its\n\ntheory of liability at a later stage of the litigation in hopes of\n\nsecuring a swifter steed.   So it is here: because the SEC unfurled\n\nits \"entanglement\" argument for the first time in the en banc\n\nproceedings, we have no occasion to address that argument.     See\n\nUnited States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"It is a\n\nbedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the\n\ndistrict court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\");\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d at 17 (explaining that \"issues adverted to in a\n\nperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed waived\").\n\n          This is not the only waiver that has transpired. The SEC\n\nunveiled for the first time in its reply brief regarding rehearing\n\nen banc a contention that its implied statement theory of Rule 10b-\n\n\n                               -31-\n\f5(b) liability could be upheld under the so-called shingle theory.\n\nSee, e.g., Duker & Duker, 6 S.E.C. 386, 388-89 (1939).12      This\n\nbelated contention is likewise waived.\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further.     This is one of those happy\n\noccasions when the language and structure of a rule, the statutory\n\nframework that it implements, and the teachings of the Supreme\n\nCourt coalesce to provide a well-lit decisional path.    Following\n\nthat path, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the SEC's\n\nRule 10b-5(b) claim.   Because en banc review is limited to this\n\nclaim, we reinstate those portions of the vacated panel judgment\n\nthat reversed the dismissal of the SEC's section 17(a)(2) and\n\naiding and abetting claims.   To that end, we also reinstate those\n\nportions of the withdrawn panel opinion, and concurrence thereto,\n\naddressing those claims (which, when reinstated, will have the\n\nforce ordinarily associated with panel opinions).    We remand the\n\ncase to the district court for further proceedings on the SEC's\n\nsection 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting claims consistent, of\n\ncourse, with this en banc opinion.\n\n\n     12\n       Under the shingle theory, a broker-dealer may be held liable\nunder section 17(a) of the Securities Act or section 10(b) of the\nExchange Act if he sells a security to a customer for a price\nunreasonably in excess of the current market price without\ndisclosing the fact of the markup. See Grandon v. Merrill Lynch &\nCo., 147 F.3d 184, 192-93 (2d Cir. 1998); Duker & Duker, 6 S.E.C.\nat 388-89. We have not been able to find any case in which the\nshingle theory has successfully been applied, under Rule 10b-5(b),\nto facts similar to the facts at hand.\n\n                               -32-\n\fSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n      — Concurring Opinion and Dissenting Opinion follow —\n\n\n\n\n                              -33-\n\f           BOUDIN, Circuit Judge, with whom LYNCH, Chief Judge,\n\njoins, concurring.        A \"plain language\" approach to statutory\n\nconstruction has well-known adherents, and--in construing the SEC's\n\nrule at issue (\"make any untrue statement of a material fact\")--\n\nbare   wording   forcefully   supports     Judge     Selya's   thorough   and\n\npersuasive    decision.     Yet   even    a   more   elastic   \"all   things\n\nconsidered\" reading of the rule's language would not justify the\n\nalarmingly ambitious use of it that the agency seeks to deploy in\n\nthis case.\n\n           The word \"make,\" in reference to a statement, ordinarily\n\nrefers to one authoring the statement or repeating it as his own;\n\none who lends to a friend a book is not normally deemed to \"make\"\n\nthe statements in the book.       See Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v.\n\nCredit Suisse First Boston (USA), Inc., 482 F.3d 372, 384 n.20 (5th\n\nCir. 2007).   There is some breathing room: for example, imagine an\n\nunderwriter orally or in writing specifically affirming to an\n\ninvestor the truth of specific statements in a prospectus that he\n\nknew to be false.\n\n           Here, the SEC propounds a far more expansive view: it\n\nasks the courts to treat securities professionals as a matter of\n\ncourse   as   impliedly     representing      the    entire    contents   of\n\nprospectuses whenever they sell securities or assist those who do.\n\nThe argument against so sweeping a position begins with language,\n\nbut it does not end there: congressional policy, Supreme Court\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\fprecedent, practical consequences and the nearly uniform view of\n\ncircuit    courts    that       have   spoken    all   argue   against    the    SEC's\n\nproposed interpretation. It helps focus the issue, and underscores\n\nthe reach of the SEC's position, to recite briefly the SEC's\n\nallegations--both those rejected and not appealed, and those on\n\nappeal--as to Tambone and Hussey's relationship to and use of the\n\nColumbia Funds prospectuses.\n\n            Tambone       and    Hussey   were    officers     of    Columbia    Funds\n\nDistributor,       Inc.    (\"Columbia      Distributor\"),        which   served    as\n\nprincipal underwriter for Columbia mutual funds.                    As underwriters,\n\nthey were required by law to furnish prospectuses to broker-dealers\n\nselling Columbia funds and to investors to whom they sold directly.\n\nSee 15 U.S.C. § 77e(b) (2006); 17 C.F.R. § 240.15c2-8(b) (2009).\n\nThe prospectuses, however, were drafted by a separate entity,\n\nColumbia Management Advisors, Inc. (\"Columbia Advisors\"), and the\n\nSEC admits in its complaint that Columbia Advisors rather than\n\nColumbia Distributor (and hence the defendants) \"remained primarily\n\nresponsible for all representations made in the prospectuses for\n\nthose funds.\"\n\n            The SEC's more specific allegations concern the creation\n\nof the prospectuses and, separately, their use.                  The SEC complaint\n\ncharged that the defendants were \"involved in the process of\n\nrevising     the     prospectuses,\"         \"reviewed      the       market     timing\n\nrepresentations before they were included in the prospectuses\" and\n\n\n                                          -35-\n\f\"comment[ed] on these representations to in-house counsel for\n\nColumbia     Advisors.\"        The     district    court   found      that   these\n\nallegations failed to plead fraud with requisite particularity, SEC\n\nv. Tambone, 473 F. Supp. 2d 162, 165-66 (D. Mass. 2006); the SEC\n\ndoes not now challenge this determination.\n\n            As to the use of the prospectuses, the SEC initially\n\nargued that Tambone and Columbia Distributor \"signed hundreds of\n\n[selling]     agreements\"       with     broker-dealers        that     expressly\n\nrepresented and warranted that \"each Prospectus and all sales\n\nliterature    .   .    .   [would]     not   by   statement    or   omission   be\n\nmisleading.\" The district court again found that these allegations\n\n\"flatly fail[ed]\" to meet the particularity requirements. Tambone,\n\n473 F. Supp. at 167.        The SEC does not argue otherwise, nor does it\n\npoint to any other specific oral or written statements made by the\n\ntwo defendants.13\n\n            The SEC's remaining allegations regarding the defendants'\n\nuse of the prospectuses, which are before us, are simply that the\n\ndefendants,       as       required,     disseminated         prospectuses     to\n\nbroker-dealers and investors in their capacity as underwriters.\n\nThe SEC does not say that the defendants explicitly represented as\n\n\n\n     13\n      Oral or written statements made by underwriters while placing\nsecurities can be predicates for securities violations. See, e.g.,\nDolphin & Bradbury, Inc. v. SEC, 512 F.3d 634, 638-40 (D.C. Cir.\n2008); Sanders v. John Nuveen & Co., 554 F.2d 790 (7th Cir. 1977);\nPicard Chem. Inc. Profit Sharing Plan v. Perrigo Co., 940 F. Supp.\n1101, 1120-21 (W.D. Mich. 1996).\n\n                                        -36-\n\ftrue to investors the prospectuses' market timing provisions or\n\nthat they even discussed the prospectuses with investors.               The SEC\n\ninstead claims that in selling securities, a defendant who neither\n\npersonally    authorized   nor    repeated     an    inaccurate    statement\n\nnevertheless \"make[s]\" an implied statement or representation under\n\nRule 10b-5(b) that the prospectuses prepared by the issuer are in\n\nall respects accurate and not materially misleading.\n\n            Following   Central    Bank   of      Denver,   N.A.   v.     First\n\nInterstate Bank of Denver, N.A., 511 U.S. 164 (1994), Congress gave\n\nthe   SEC   alone   statutory    authority   to     bring   actions     against\n\nindividuals who aided and abetted a section 10(b) violation, 15\n\nU.S.C. § 78t(e); and this authority might be used to charge one who\n\ndistributed a false prospectus knowing that it contained false\n\nstatements.     The SEC's position in this case would undo this\n\ndeliberate legislative compromise, see S. Rep. No. 104-98, at 19\n\n(1995), and it would conflict with practically all of the pertinent\n\ncircuit cases.14\n\n\n\n\n      14\n      Post Central Bank, this implied representation theory has\nbeen regularly rejected by the circuits, see Lattanzio v. Deloitte\n& Touche LLP, 476 F.3d 147, 155 (2d Cir. 2007) (rejecting an\n\"implied assertion\" theory because \"[p]ublic understanding that an\naccountant is at work . . . does not create an exception to the\nrequirement that an actionable misstatement be made by the\naccountant\"); Fidel v. Farley, 392 F.3d 220, 235 (6th Cir. 2004);\nZiemba v. Cascade Int'l, Inc., 256 F.3d 1194, 1205-06 (11th Cir.\n2001); Anixter v. Home-Stake Prod.

The SEC may select its defendants sensibly;\n\nbut private litigants have their own incentives, and the SEC\n\nconcedes that its definition of \"make,\" if adopted, would apply to\n\nprivate party actions as well.       The Supreme Court has repeatedly\n\nacknowledged the unique risk of \"vexatious\" securities litigation,15\n\nand it has likewise cautioned against extending further the court-\n\ncreated private remedy under section 10(b).         See Stoneridge Inv.\n\nPartners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U.S. 148, 165\n\n(2008); accord Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 199-201\n\n(1976).\n\n          Nothing justifies the adventure proposed by the agency.\n\nThe conduct charged is already covered by an aiding and abetting\n\nremedy available to the SEC itself.       15 U.S.C. § 78t(e).    Sections\n\n11 and 12 of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77k, 77l, allow private\n\nsuits--but with important limitations--against underwriters who\n\nfail to make reasonable investigations into the prospectuses they\n\ndistribute.

The majority acknowledges that the\n\nSupreme Court in Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate\n\nBank of Denver, N.A., 511 U.S. 164 (1994), \"did not purpose to\n\ndecide the precise issue before us\" – what it means to \"make\" a\n\nstatement – but asserts that a construction of \"make\" that embraces\n\nthe conduct alleged in this case would be at odds with Central\n\nBank's careful distinction between primary and secondary liability.\n\nThere     is    no    such     conflict.          My   colleagues    overstate   the\n\nsignificance of Central Bank for the interpretive issue before us,\n\nfail to account for the underwriter's unique statutory duty to\n\nprovide investors with accurate information, and misguidedly allow\n\nconcerns about excessive private litigation to influence their\n\njudgment on the scope of public enforcement by the Securities and\n\nExchange Commission. In my view, the language of section 10(b) and\n\nRule 10b-5(b), the underwriter's role and duties in the securities\n\nmarket,    and       decades   of   case   law     –   including    Central   Bank   –\n\ninescapably permit the SEC to proceed against Tambone and Hussey\n\nfor making false statements within the purview of Rule 10b-5(b).\n\nI therefore respectfully dissent.16\n\n\n\n\n     16\n       I join the majority's decision to reinstate the portions of\nthe panel opinion addressing the SEC's section 17(a)(2) and aiding\nand abetting claims and the portions of the panel judgment\nreversing those claims.\n\n                                           -40-\n\f                                     I.\n\n           The important issue before the en banc court is whether\n\nthe defendants' use of false and misleading prospectus statements\n\ncan constitute the making of statements that render the defendants\n\nprimarily liable under Rule 10b-5(b). The Commission asserts that,\n\nas senior executives of the primary underwriter for the Columbia\n\nFunds, Tambone and Hussey had a duty to confirm the accuracy and\n\ncompleteness     of   the   prospectuses   they   were   responsible   for\n\ndistributing to broker-dealers and potential investors. It further\n\ncontends that, by using the prospectuses as required to perform\n\ntheir   duties   to   potential   investors,   defendants   made   implied\n\nstatements asserting that they had a reasonable basis to believe\n\nthat the key statements in the prospectuses regarding market timing\n\nwere accurate and complete.       Because the defendants allegedly knew\n\nthat those statements were false, or were reckless in not knowing,\n\ntheir implied statements were also false.           The SEC argues that\n\nthese direct representations of Tambone and Hussey, albeit implied,\n\nsubject the defendants to primary liability under section 10(b) and\n\nRule 10b-5(b).\n\n           The majority dismisses the SEC's position as untenable on\n\nthe basis of \"the language and structure of [the] rule, the\n\nstatutory framework that it implements, and the teachings of the\n\nSupreme Court.\"       It is the majority's view that is untenable. It\n\nconstrues the Rule to exclude the long accepted understanding that\n\n\n                                    -41-\n\funderwriters \"make\" implied statements to investors about the\n\naccuracy and completeness of prospectuses they are using to induce\n\ninvestments.    It rejects primary liability for fraudulent conduct\n\nat the heart of Rule 10b-5's prohibitions by stretching Central\n\nBank beyond both its text and context and using that unjustified\n\nexpansion to justify its contraction of the Rule's scope.\n\n            As I shall explain, the language of the statute and the\n\nRule, viewed in the context of the unique role of underwriters in\n\nselling   securities,   supports    the   Commission's     allegation   that\n\nTambone and Hussey made implied statements to investors that are\n\nactionable as primary violations of Rule 10b-5(b).                  I begin,\n\nhowever, by addressing the premise at the heart of the majority's\n\nposition – its unfounded assumption that Central Bank's \"carefully\n\ndrawn circumscription of the private right of action\" substantially\n\nchanged the landscape for securities claims under Rule 10b-5 in the\n\nvery   different   context   of   an   SEC   enforcement   action    against\n\nunderwriters.\n\nA. Central Bank and Rule 10b-5\n\n            The majority argues that reading Rule 10b-5(b) to reach\n\nthe making of implied statements would be to disregard the Supreme\n\nCourt's holding in Central Bank and to effectively eliminate the\n\nboundaries between primary and secondary liability required by that\n\ndecision.    This contention overstates the substance of the case\n\nand, consequently, its reach.\n\n\n                                   -42-\n\f           1.    What the Court Decided\n\n           The issue in Central Bank was whether the bank, the\n\nindenture trustee for bonds issued by the public Building Authority\n\nto finance improvements at a planned development in Colorado\n\nSprings, could be held liable in a private cause of action under\n\nRule 10b-5 for aiding and abetting a primary violation of the law.\n\nAlthough Central Bank had become aware that the collateral for the\n\nbonds had likely become insufficient to support them, it delayed\n\nundertaking     an   independent   review   of   the   original   appraisal.\n\nBefore an independent review could be done, the Building Authority\n\ndefaulted on a portion of the bonds.\n\n           The plaintiff raised claims of primary liability against\n\nfour violators: the Building Authority, which issued the defaulted\n\nbonds in question, two underwriters for the bonds, and a director\n\nof the development company in charge of providing an appraisal of\n\nthe   bonds.      The   Building   Authority     defaulted   early   in   the\n\nlitigation and the claims against the underwriters were settled.\n\nSee First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A. v. Pring, 969 F.2d 891,\n\n893 n.1 (10th Cir. 1992).\n\n           The Supreme Court, relying on the text of section 10(b)\n\nand Rule 10b-5, concluded that the aiding and abetting claims\n\nagainst Central Bank had to be dismissed because private plaintiffs\n\nmay only bring claims of primary liability, not aiding and abetting\n\nliability.      Nevertheless, the Court noted that \"[i]n any complex\n\n\n                                    -43-\n\fsecurities fraud . . . there are likely to be multiple violators;\n\nin this case, for example, respondents named four defendants as\n\nprimary   violators.\"17    511   U.S. at   191.   Finally,     the   Court\n\nconcluded that it is not the identity of a securities actor but his\n\nconduct that determines whether he may be liable as a primary\n\nviolator:\n\n            The absence of § 10(b) aiding and abetting\n            liability does not mean that secondary actors\n            in the securities markets are always free from\n            liability under the securities Acts.         Any\n            person   or  entity,    including    a   lawyer,\n            accountant,   or    bank,    who    employs    a\n            manipulative device or makes a material\n            misstatement   (or   omission)   on    which   a\n            purchaser or seller of securities relies may\n\n\n     17\n       Tambone and Hussey argue, inter alia, that the Commission's\nclaims of primary liability should be rejected because of the SEC's\nown admission that Columbia Advisors, not defendants, \"remained\nprimarily responsible for all representations made\" in the fund\nprospectuses.     However, this quotation from Central Bank\nillustrates the Supreme Court's recognition that a securities fraud\nwill likely involve multiple violators, thereby suggesting that\nindividuals with different responsibilities could be primarily\nliable for the same misstatement. See 511 U.S. at 191. Therefore,\nthe primary liability of Columbia Advisors does not preclude the\nprimary liability of Tambone and Hussey for their own use of the\nfalse and misleading statements contained in those prospectuses.\nThe Supreme Court recently confirmed this principle in a private\nlawsuit by indicating that defendants Charter Communications,\nScientific-Atlanta, Inc., and Motorola, Inc., had all engaged in\nthe fraudulent conduct at issue. See Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC\nv. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U.S. 148, 158-61 (2008). Although\nthe Court's statement in Central Bank referred to Rule 10b-5(b),\naddressing material statements and omissions, and its comment in\nStoneridge applied to 10b-5(a) or (c), addressing other types of\ndeceptive conduct, the scope of primary liability in each\nsubsection is governed by the language of section 10(b) of the\nExchange Act. Therefore, the Supreme Court's recent confirmation\nthat multiple individuals may be primarily liable under Rule 10b-\n5(a) or (c) is applicable to its interpretation of Rule 10b-5(b).\n\n                                  -44-\n\f          be liable as a primary violator under 10b-5,\n          assuming all of the requirements for primary\n          liability under Rule 10b-5 are met.\n\nId. (emphasis omitted).\n\n          2.   What the Court Did Not Decide\n\n          The Court in Central Bank addressed only the question of\n\n\"whether private civil liability under § 10(b) extends as well to\n\nthose who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptive practice,\n\nbut who aid and abet the violation.\" 511 U.S. at 167; see also id.\n\nat 176 (\"The problem, of course, is that aiding and abetting\n\nliability extends beyond persons who engage, even indirectly, in a\n\nproscribed activity; aiding and abetting liability reaches persons\n\nwho do not engage in the proscribed activities at all, but who give\n\na degree of aid to those who do.\").   The issue here is whether the\n\ndefendants themselves \"engage[d] in the manipulative or deceptive\n\npractice,\" i.e., whether the defendants' acts are \"sufficient to\n\nshow that they 'made' the [alleged] material misstatements and\n\nomissions . . . such that they can be held primarily liable.\"   SEC\n\nv. Wolfson, 539 F.3d 1249, 1258 (10th Cir. 2008).   Holding Tambone\n\nand Hussey responsible for their own false implied statements does\n\nnot threaten the primary/secondary dichotomy.\n\n          Moreover, it is critical to recognize that Central Bank\n\nanalyzes the scope of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 in a suit\n\nbrought by a private plaintiff.   Although the Court focused on the\n\ntext of the provisions, it also emphasized the element of reliance\n\n\n                               -45-\n\f(which was not satisfied in that case), as well as a set of policy\n\nconsiderations that arise exclusively in the context of private\n\nsecurities litigation.      See 511 U.S. at 173-178, 180, 188-89.        In\n\nthis respect, Central Bank reflected the Court's desire to limit\n\nthe scope of the judicially implied private cause of action under\n\nRule 10b-5.18      Indeed, the Court has consistently distinguished\n\nbetween   the   broad    contours    of   the   SEC's   \"express   statutory\n\nauthority to enforce [Rule 10b-5],\" Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner\n\n& Smith v. Dabit, 547 U.S. 71, 79-81 (2006), and the \"narrow\n\ndimensions\" of the implied private right of action, Stoneridge, 552\n\nU.S. at 167; see also SEC v. Zandford, 535 U.S. 813, 819 (2002)\n\n(noting, in a Commission action, that the Securities Exchange Act,\n\nincluding § 10(b), \"should be 'construed \"not technically and\n\nrestrictively, but flexibly to effectuate its remedial purposes\"'\")\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n           Thus,    as   the   SEC   argues,    \"[p]olicy   considerations\n\nconcerning private litigation can have no relevance in defining the\n\nscope of primary liability under Section 10(b) in a Commission\n\nenforcement action.\" The Court's restrictive application of Rule\n\n10b-5 in Central Bank – a case brought by a private plaintiff –\n\n\n\n     18\n        Cf. United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 664 (1997)\n(noting that Central Bank \"concerned only private civil litigation\nunder § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, not criminal liability[,]\" and\ntherefore that its \"reference to purchasers or sellers of\nsecurities must be read in light of a longstanding limitation on\nprivate § 10(b) suits\").\n\n                                     -46-\n\fcannot sensibly be stretched beyond its logic to invalidate, in an\n\nSEC enforcement action, an interpretation of an element of Rule\n\n10b-5(b) on which the Supreme Court was silent.\n\n            3.     Distinguishing     between      Primary     and     Secondary\nViolations\n\n            Although the private action context limits Central Bank's\n\nsignificance for the SEC enforcement action at issue here, the\n\nCourt did effect an important change in securities law by holding\n\nthat aiding and abetting claims were no longer available in private\n\nactions.     In its aftermath, lower courts sought to delineate the\n\nouter boundaries of primary liability, an issue the Supreme Court\n\nhad not addressed. As the majority notes, our sister circuits have\n\ncrafted two divergent standards to analyze the question: the\n\n\"bright-line\"      test,    associated     most   closely    with    the   Second\n\nCircuit,     and   the     broader   \"substantial     participation\"        test,\n\narticulated by the Ninth Circuit. The majority observes that it is\n\nunnecessary to choose one of these paths in this case because the\n\nconduct at issue – \"the use and dissemination of prospectuses\n\ncreated by others\" – does not satisfy either test.                  I agree that\n\nthere is no need to choose between these standards, but for a\n\ndifferent     reason:      neither   the    bright-line      nor     substantial\n\nparticipation test is relevant here.\n\n            The substantial participation test evaluates whether one\n\nactor can be deemed to have made a statement made or created by\n\nanother because of the actor's \"substantial participation\" in the\n\n                                     -47-\n\fmaking or creation of that statement.               In this case, the SEC\n\nalleges that Tambone and Hussey are accountable for their own\n\nimplied statements, making the \"substantial participation\" inquiry\n\nunnecessary.    See In re LDK Solar Sec. Litig., No. C07-05182WHA,\n\n2008 WL 4369987, at *8 n.9 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 24, 2008) (declining to\n\naddress   defendants'    claim      that    they   had   not   \"substantially\n\nparticipated\" in making the fraudulent statements at issue because\n\nthe court had already determined that they should be \"deemed\n\nactually to have made those statements\").            Similarly, the bright\n\nline test does not address what it means to \"make\" a statement.            It\n\nsimply requires that the defendant \"actually make\" the statement at\n\nissue, Wright v. Ernst & Young LLP, 152 F.3d 169, 175 (2d Cir.\n\n1998),    and   it   imposes   an    attribution     requirement    that   is\n\ninapplicable to SEC enforcement actions because it relates to the\n\nelement of reliance that is required only in a private Rule 10b-5\n\naction.    See Wolfson, 539 F.3d at 1259-60 (observing that the\n\nattribution requirement \"stems directly from the need for private\n\nlitigants to prove reliance on alleged fraud to succeed on a\n\nprivate cause of action\").\n\n           Whether or not these tests are useful in distinguishing\n\nprimary from secondary conduct, they shed no light on the issue\n\nthat is before us: determining whether the defendants have \"made\"\n\na statement, which unquestionably would subject them to primary\n\nliability.\n\n\n\n                                     -48-\n\f            4.    The Limited Relevance of Central Bank\n\n            The Supreme Court in Central Bank focused on the crucial\n\ndichotomy   between      those   who,    regardless     of   their   role    in   a\n\nsecurities transaction, make misleading representations themselves,\n\nand those who assist the culpable actor without personally using or\n\nemploying any \"manipulative or deceptive device\" as prohibited by\n\nsection 10(b).      In this SEC enforcement action, primary liability\n\nis premised on the defendants' having themselves impliedly stated\n\nthat they had a reasonable basis to believe that the market timing\n\ndisclosures in the prospectuses were truthful and complete.\n\n            Central Bank does not address the important issue in this\n\ncase – whether the defendants \"made\" statements within the meaning\n\nof Rule 10b-5(b) – and we must look elsewhere for guidance.                  As I\n\ndescribe below, both the language of the Rule and substantial\n\nprecedent    on    the   role    and     status   of    underwriters    in    the\n\ndistribution      of   securities      support    the   SEC's   argument     that\n\nTambone's and Hussey's alleged actions fall within the purview of\n\nthe \"make a statement\" requirement of Rule 10b-5(b).\n\nB. The Scope of Liability under Rule 10b-5(b): Making a Statement\n\n            1. Text of Section 10(b)\n\n            Although Rule 10b-5 itself offers little guidance on how\n\nto define \"make,\" the text of section 10(b), its authorizing\n\nstatute, also must be examined.           Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425\n\nU.S. 185, 197 (1976) (\"In addressing [the question of the proper\n\n\n                                        -49-\n\fscienter requirement under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5], we turn\n\nfirst to the language of s 10(b), for '(t)he starting point in\n\nevery case involving construction of a statute is the language\n\nitself.'\" (quoting Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S.\n\n723, 756 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring))); Pinter v. Dahl, 486\n\nU.S. 622, 653 (1988) (\"The ascertainment of congressional intent\n\nwith respect to the scope of liability created by a particular\n\nsection of the Securities Act must rest primarily on the language\n\nof   that    section.\").      The   statutory   language   is   particularly\n\nrelevant in this case because \"[t]he scope of Rule 10b-5 is\n\ncoextensive with the coverage of § 10(b),\" a view that has led the\n\nSupreme Court to \"use § 10(b) to refer to both the statutory\n\nprovision and the Rule.\"       Zandford, 535 U.S. at 816 n.1; see also\n\nStoneridge, 552 U.S. at 157 (\"Rule 10b-5 encompasses only conduct\n\nalready prohibited by § 10(b).\").\n\n             In other words, the term \"make a statement\" in Rule 10b-\n\n519 must be read in conjunction with the text of section 10(b),\n\n      19\n           The Rule states:\n\n      It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or\n      indirectly . . .\n      (a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to\n      defraud,\n      (b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or\n      to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to\n      make the statements made, in the light of the\n      circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,\n      or\n      (c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of\n      business which operates or would operate as a fraud or\n      deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase\n\n                                     -50-\n\fwhich deems it \"unlawful for any person . . . [t]o use or employ,\n\nin connection with the purchase or sale of any security . . . , any\n\nmanipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of\n\nsuch rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe.\"              15\n\nU.S.C. § 78j(b) (emphasis added).          The SEC's allegations against\n\nappellants are stated in precisely those statutory terms.          The SEC\n\navers that defendants used and employed prospectuses containing\n\nstatements prohibiting market timing practices – statements that\n\nthey knew or were reckless in not knowing were false – and in so\n\ndoing impliedly stated that they had a reasonable basis to believe\n\nthat   the   market   timing    disclosures   in   the   prospectuses   were\n\ntruthful and complete.\n\n             The majority counters that one cannot \"'make' a statement\n\nwhen he merely uses a statement created entirely by others.\"              It\n\nasserts that subsection (b) of Rule 10b-5 applies to only a subset\n\nof the conduct that falls within the statute's proscription – i.e.,\n\nonly the literal \"making\" of statements and not all \"uses\" of them.\n\nId.    The majority reinforces this pronouncement by pointing out\n\nthat another section of the Rule, 10b-5(a), does prohibit the\n\n\"employ[ment]\" of any \"device, scheme or artifice to defraud,\" and\n\nit    concludes   that   this    difference   in   language   proves    that\n\n\n\n\n       or sale of any security.\n\n17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.\n\n                                    -51-\n\fsubsection (b) of the Rule was deliberately framed as a narrower\n\nprohibition against \"making,\" but not \"using,\" statements.\n\n               The question before us is not whether the words \"use\" and\n\n\"make\" are interchangeable, however – I agree they are not – but\n\nwhether the conduct that occurred here could constitute \"making\" a\n\nstatement within the meaning of Rule 10b-5(b).                       The majority's\n\nposition is that one cannot make a statement without explicitly\n\nspeaking or writing the words at issue.                The statutory language,\n\nhowever    –    prohibiting        the   \"use,\"    inter   alia,     of   \"deceptive\n\ndevice[s]\" – is broad enough to encompass less literal forms of\n\n\"making\" a statement. Indeed, it defies ordinary experience to say\n\nthat a statement can only be \"made\" by \"the physical or manual act\n\nof writing or transcribing [a] report\" or speaking words.

It   is   a    commonplace\n\nobservation that someone has \"made a statement\" through his or her\n\nconduct.\n\n               Unsurprisingly, a broader reading of \"make\" also is\n\nconsistent       with   the   dictionary         definitions,    which      are   more\n\ninclusive than the majority acknowledges and include \"deliver,\n\nutter, or put forth.\"              See The Random House Dictionary of the\n\nEnglish Language 1161 (2d ed. 1987).                Those meanings embrace the\n\nSEC's argument that, by using the prospectuses as they did, the\n\ndefendants \"deliver[ed]\" or \"put forth\" implied statements of their\n\nown attesting to the accuracy and completeness of the prospectuses.\n\n\n\n                                          -52-\n\fIn    case    law,    as    well    as     common     parlance,    this     is   not     an\n\nunprecedented interpretation of the word \"make.\"                          In Reass v.\n\nUnited States, 99 F.2d 752 (4th Cir. 1938), for example, the court\n\nheld that \"making\" a false statement for purposes of a federal\n\nmortgage fraud statute meant communicating it and not merely\n\ncomposing it.        Id. at 755.         Although the majority correctly points\n\nout the very different context in Reass, the fact remains that the\n\ncourt did not confine \"making a statement\" to the literal meaning\n\non which the majority insists.                 See also, e.g., O'Neil, 135 P. at\n\n63.\n\n              To be sure, Rule 10b-5(b) contemplates some range of\n\nconduct      narrower      than    the    statute's     all-encompassing         \"use   or\n\nemploy.\"      But that fact does not mean that particular uses of\n\nstatements by particular players in the sale of securities cannot\n\nconstitute the \"making\" of implied statements.                    The Rule thus does\n\nnot require Tambone and Hussey to have explicitly spoken or written\n\nthe false statement at issue here, i.e., that \"I have a reasonable\n\nbasis for believing that the market timing disclosures in the\n\nprospectuses       are     truthful      and    complete.\"        Rather,    given      the\n\nstatutory duties imposed upon them as underwriters, see infra, that\n\nrepresentation was implicit in the defendants' conduct in using the\n\nprospectuses to induce individuals to invest in Columbia Funds.\n\n              As     the   SEC     explains      in   its   en    banc    brief,     this\n\nunderstanding of what it means to \"make\" a statement is necessary\n\n\n\n                                            -53-\n\fto fulfill the objective of Congress and the Commission to punish\n\n\"any untrue statement of a material fact\" made with knowledge or\n\nreckless   disregard    for   its   truth.      See   Rule   10b-5(b).   An\n\nunderwriter could well know that representations in a prospectus\n\nare false even when the individual who actually wrote the words was\n\nunaware    of   the   inaccuracies.        In   those   circumstances,   an\n\nunderwriter who knowingly gives investors a prospectus containing\n\nfalsehoods could not be held liable in an SEC enforcement action\n\nfor aiding and abetting the unwitting drafter, who did not himself\n\ncommit fraud. If such an underwriter could not be held responsible\n\nas a primary offender, the underwriter would, in the SEC's words,\n\n\"be free from any liability under Section 10(b) whatsoever.\"20           It\n\ntakes no stretch of the language of Rule 10b-5(b) to view such an\n\nunderwriter as having attested to the accuracy of the prospectus\n\ncontents, i.e., to have knowingly \"made\" an implied – false –\n\nstatement to investors that the prospectus accurately describes the\n\nfund's risks.    See Hanly v. SEC, 415 F.2d 589, 597 (2d Cir. 1969)\n\n(\"By [an underwriter's] recommendation he implies that a reasonable\n\ninvestigation has been made and that his recommendation rests on\n\nthe conclusions based on such investigation.\").\n\n\n\n\n     20\n       Although deceptive conduct in the sale of securities could\ntrigger liability under section 17(a), that provision does not\ncover purchases and therefore would not always offer an alternative\nvehicle for SEC enforcement.\n\n                                    -54-\n\f            2. The Duties of an Underwriter\n\n            In assessing whether a defendant has committed a primary\n\nviolation    of    the    securities     laws,    courts     have    examined    the\n\ndefendant's role in the securities market in addition to the\n\nspecific    conduct      alleged    in   the    complaint.      These    decisions\n\nindicate that a defendant's general responsibilities and statutory\n\nduties with respect to the sale and distribution of securities\n\ninform the legal significance of specific conduct under Rule\n\n10b-5(b).    See, e.g., In re Scholastic Corp. Sec. Litig., 252 F.3d\n\n63, 77 (2d Cir. 2001) (analyzing a corporate executive's liability\n\nfor \"making\" misleading statements in light of his duties and\n\nresponsibilities); SEC v. KPMG LLP, 412 F. Supp. 2d 349, 376-77\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 2006) (holding that three engagement partners of an\n\nauditing firm who possessed the \"ultimate authority to determine\n\nwhether an audit opinion should be issued\" could be primarily\n\nliable under the securities laws for misstatements contained in the\n\naudit opinion letters, although a fourth defendant, who only acted\n\nas a concurring review partner, could not be held primarily liable,\n\nas his responsibilities were \"not the equivalent of the audit\n\nengagement    partner's         responsibilities\").        Indeed,     the   Second\n\nCircuit    has    made    the    particularly     relevant    observation       that\n\n\"[s]ilence where there is a duty to disclose can constitute a false\n\nor misleading statement within the meaning of § 10(b) and Rule\n\n10b-5.\" Wright, 152 F.3d at 177 (emphasis added).                   Thus, by virtue\n\n\n\n                                         -55-\n\fof his role in the securities market and his statutory duties, a\n\ndefendant may make an implied statement without actually uttering\n\nthe words in question.\n\n            Underwriters play an essential role in the sale and\n\ndistribution of mutual funds to the investing public, which occurs\n\neither directly or through other broker-dealers.             The text and\n\nstatutory history of the Securities Act of 1933, and specifically\n\nthe statute's treatment of underwriters in sections 1121 and 12,22\n\nhighlight   the   unique   position   they   occupy   in   the   securities\n\nindustry.   As the Southern District of New York has observed in the\n\ncontext of evaluating several securities claims:\n\n     [I]n enacting Section 11, \"Congress recognized that\n     underwriters occupied a unique position that enabled them\n     to discover and compel disclosure of essential facts\n     about the offering. Congress believed that subjecting\n     underwriters to the liability provisions would provide\n     the necessary incentive to ensure their careful\n     investigation of the offering.\"\n\nIn re Worldcom, Inc.

Thus, contrary to the majority's\n\nassertion, this is not a situation in which the liability alleged\n\nis based \"merely\" on the use of \"a statement created entirely by\n\nothers.\" In this limited context, where the duties of underwriters\n\nto potential investors are prescribed by statute, the knowing or\n\nreckless use of a prospectus containing false statements involves\n\nthe underwriter's own implied statement falsely affirming the\n\naccuracy of the prospectus content.\n\n          The   majority   attempts    to   discredit   some   of   this\n\ninconvenient precedent because it pre-dates Central Bank.           The\n\nmajority's treatment of Chris-Craft, which strongly supports the\n\nSEC's position, is illustrative.      The Second Circuit held that an\n\nunderwriter \"makes\" a statement under section 14(e) of the Exchange\n\nAct when constructively representing that registration materials\n\n\n\n\n     24\n       The judgment in Sanders was vacated and remanded for further\nconsideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Ernst &\nErnst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185 (1976), which held that scienter\nis an element of a private cause of action under section 10(b) and\nRule 10b-5. See John Nuveen & Co. v. Sanders, 425 U.S. 929 (1976);\nHochfelder, 425 U.S. at 193. The Seventh Circuit on remand held\nthat liability could no longer rest on Rule 10b-5 because the\ndefendant's conduct had been \"mistaken but honest in belief.\" 554\nF.2d at 792. As the majority points out, when the Seventh Circuit\nsubsequently re-heard the case, it referred to explicit statements\nmade by the defendant underwriter. See 619 F.2d 1222, 1234 (7th\nCir. 1980). In its earlier ruling, however, the court had noted\nthat \"the evidence does not indicate that all members of the class\nrelied on express recommendations,\" 524 F.2d at 1069, and it\ntherefore based liability on the underwriter's implied statements.\n\n                                -61-\n\fare accurate and complete.25 480 F.2d at 370 (noting that, although\n\nan underwriter does not \"in a literal sense\" make statements to\n\npotential investors, we do not read § 14(e) so narrowly\").                 The\n\nmajority disregards Chris-Craft because it preceded Central Bank by\n\nmore than twenty years, observing that the Second Circuit had no\n\nreason to distinguish between primary and secondary liability at\n\nthat time.    As the SEC points out, however, and our discussion\n\nabove confirms, Central Bank did not diminish the statutory duties\n\nof underwriters or otherwise affect the courts' identification of\n\nthe duties owed by underwriters to the investing public.\n\n           Hence, Chris-Craft and similar cases may not be cast\n\naside as no longer relevant.       The majority errs in its dismissal of\n\nprecedent, fully consistent with Central Bank, indicating that\n\nimplied   statements   made   by   underwriters   –   a   unique   class    of\n\nsecurities professionals – may fall within the scope of Rule 10b-5.\n\n                                     II.\n\n           My colleagues fear that including implied statements\n\nwithin the purview of Rule 10b-5(b) would trigger a flood of\n\nvexatious private lawsuits against a wide spectrum of participants\n\n\n\n     25\n        Section 14(e) provides, in relevant part: \"It shall be\nunlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a material\nfact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make\nthe statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they\nare made, not misleading, . . . in connection with any tender\noffer.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78n(e). That language is in pertinent respects\nidentical to the language in Rule 10b-5(b) that is at issue here.\n\n\n                                    -62-\n\fin the securities industry.             I cannot deny that private plaintiffs\n\nwould try to push the SEC's implied statement position beyond its\n\ncontext     in   this    case.         That    is    a   predictable        and      familiar\n\nphenomenon in our legal system. It then becomes the responsibility\n\nof courts to determine which attempts to expand the law are\n\nmeritorious      and    which    are    not.         Inescapably,        this     method     of\n\ndeveloping the law imposes costs on defendants who ultimately\n\nprevail. These inevitable costs should not deter us, however, from\n\nreaching the result required by the applicable law in the case\n\nbefore     us.     Specifically,         they       should     not   lead       us   here    to\n\ncircumscribe the authority of the SEC to meet its responsibility to\n\nthe public to prevent fraud in the securities industry.\n\n             In addition, the majority's fears discount too readily\n\nthe   particular       context    of    this    case.          As    I   have    described,\n\nunderwriters play a unique role in the securities industry, and\n\nthey have responsibilities and a statutory duty not shared by every\n\nsecurities       professional.           Indeed,         the   cases      cited      in     the\n\nconcurrence for the proposition that the implied representation\n\ntheory \"has been regularly rejected by the circuits\" all involve\n\nsecondary players, such as accountants, auditors and lawyers, who\n\ntypically lack the \"trail guide\" relationship with the investing\n\npublic that is the hallmark of the underwriter's role.26\n\n\n      26\n        See Lattanzio v. Deloitte & Touche LLP, 476 F.3d 147, 155\n(2d Cir. 2007) (accountant); Fidel v.

The majority, quoting Chiarella v. United\n\nStates, 445 U.S. 222, 228 (1980), acknowledges that a duty to\n\ndisclose information in the securities setting may arise from \"'a\n\nfiduciary or other similar relation of trust and confidence'\n\nbetween the parties\" that exists outside the obligations imposed by\n\nRule 10b-5.      See SEC v.

Co.,\n77 F.3d 1215, 1226-27 (10th Cir. 1996) (accountant).\n     27\n       The majority quotes Fortson v. Winstead, McGuire, Sechrest\n& Minick, 961 F.2d 469 (4th Cir. 1992), for the proposition that\n\"'the duty to disclose material facts arises only when there is\nsome basis outside the securities laws, such as state law, for\nfinding a fiduciary or other confidential relationship.'\" Id. at\n472.   Several circuits have adopted the proposition that federal\nsecurities law cannot establish the requisite duty.     Id.   That\nexclusion would be inappropriate for underwriters, whose unique\nduty to investors is deeply embedded in federal law independent of\nsection 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. See supra Section B.2.\n\n                                    -64-\n\fto sell securities. Plaintiffs seeking to expand the SEC's implied\n\nstatement approach beyond underwriters will face the challenge of\n\nidentifying an equivalent duty on the part of other actors in the\n\nsecurities industry.\n\n           Moreover, private litigants face multiple burdens in\n\npleading securities claims.        Not only must they meet the standard\n\nrequirement   that     allegations      of   fraud     be     pleaded    with\n\nparticularity, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), but – unlike the SEC –\n\nthey also must prove reliance on the alleged misrepresentations,\n\neconomic loss, and loss causation, see, e.g., Stoneridge, 552 U.S.\n\nat 157.    The reliance requirement, in particular, weakens my\n\ncolleagues' concern that private litigants will be able to bring\n\nimpermissible aiding and abetting claims in the guise of primary\n\nclaims.   With significant barriers already in place to protect\n\nagainst excessive securities litigation by private plaintiffs, the\n\nway to protect against overreaching by private plaintiffs is to\n\nstrictly enforce those requirements – not to deny the SEC the full\n\nscope of its enforcement authority.\n\n                                     III.\n\n           The underwriter's special duty to investors is anchored\n\nin statutes and administrative guidance and confirmed by case law\n\nwhose   relevant   wisdom   was    unaffected   by   the    Supreme   Court's\n\ndecision in Central Bank.         In light of that duty, an underwriter\n\nwho uses a prospectus in a securities transaction in the manner\n\n\n                                     -65-\n\falleged here impliedly states that he has reason to believe the\n\ncontents of the prospectus are accurate. If the underwriter knows,\n\nor is reckless in not knowing, that the statements contained within\n\nthe    prospectus   are    in   fact   false,   the   underwriter's     implied\n\nstatement is likewise false.            An underwriter who makes such a\n\nstatement has violated Rule 10b-5(b).\n\n             The SEC in this case alleges that Tambone and Hussey made\n\nsuch statements to investors when they used the prospectuses\n\ncontaining false statements about timing practices to sell the\n\nColumbia Funds.          They allegedly knew, or were reckless in not\n\nknowing, that those statements were false.            These allegations were\n\nstated with sufficient particularity to meet the requirements of\n\nFed.    R.   Civ.   P.   12(b)(6),     in   conjunction   with   Rule   9(b).28\n\nDefendants' motions to dismiss the primary liability claims under\n\nsection 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) should therefore have been denied.\n\n             Hence, I would reverse the dismissal of the SEC's claims\n\nunder section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) and remand to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings on those claims, as well as on the\n\nsection 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting claims.\n\n\n       28\n        The allegations in the SEC's complaint are described in\ndetail in the panel decision, SEC v. Tambone, 550 F.3d 106, 141-143\n(1st Cir. 2008), and need not be repeated here. It suffices to say\nthat    the    SEC    meticulously     identified    the    alleged\nmisrepresentations, the defendants' roles in overseeing the\ndistribution of fund prospectuses in connection with the sale of\nColumbia Funds, and the basis for their knowledge or recklessness\nin not knowing that prohibited market timing arrangements existed\n(rendering the prospectus statements false).\n\n                                       -66-\n\f",

The issue before us is one of first impression. It turns on the meaning of the word \"make\" as used in Rule 10b-5(b). The SEC advocates an expansive definition, contending that one may \"make\" a statement within the purview of the rule by merely using or disseminating a statement without regard to the authorship of that statement or, in the alternative, that securities professionals who direct the offering and sale of shares on behalf of an underwriter impliedly \"make\" a statement, covered by the rule, to the effect that the disclosures in a prospectus are truthful and complete.</p>\n<p>We reject the SEC's expansive interpretation. It is inconsistent with the text of the rule and with the ordinary meanings of the phrase \"to make a statement,\" inconsistent with the structure of the rule and relevant statutes, and in considerable tension with Supreme Court precedent. Consequently, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the SEC's Rule 10b-5(b) claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Because this appeal follows the district court's granting of a motion to dismiss, we rehearse the facts as well-pleaded in the SEC's complaint. <i>See </i><i>Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> 406 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>At all times material hereto (roughly, 1998-2003), the defendants, James Tambone and Robert Hussey, were senior executives of a registered broker-dealer, Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc. (Columbia Distributor), or its predecessor in interest. Columbia Distributor underwrites and markets mutual funds. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated sundry provisions of both the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Exchange Act. Its complaint depicts a tangled web of interlocking entities. We briefly trace the fibers within that web.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*439</span> During the relevant period, Columbia Distributor was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbia Management Group, Inc. (Columbia Management) and an indirect subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corporation (Fleet). Columbia Distributor was known as Liberty Funds Distributor, Inc. (Liberty Distributor) until 2001, when Fleet purchased its parent corporation, Liberty Financial Group (Liberty).</p>\n<p>Columbia Distributor acted as the principal underwriter and distributor of over 140 mutual funds in the Columbia mutual fund complex (the Columbia Funds). The Columbia Funds included several funds that had been owned by Liberty prior to the take-over by Fleet. In its wonted role, Columbia Distributor sold shares in the Columbia Funds and disseminated their prospectuses to investors.</p>\n<p>Direct responsibility for the representations contained in the prospectuses rested with the funds' sponsor, Columbia Management Advisors, Inc., and its predecessors in interest (collectively, Columbia Advisors). Like Columbia Distributor, Columbia Advisors was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbia Management and, thus, an indirect subsidiary of Fleet for much of the relevant period.</p>\n<p>The defendants held positions of trust and responsibility in this corporate pyramid. Tambone served as co-president of Columbia Distributor from 2001 to 2004. Prior thereto, he held the same post with Liberty Distributor. Hussey served as managing director (national accounts) of Columbia Distributor from 2002 until 2004. Before that, he occupied a comparable position with Liberty Distributor. The SEC does not allege that either defendant worked for the Columbia Funds' sponsor, Columbia Advisors, during the relevant time frame.</p>\n<p>The short-term trading practice that lies at the epicenter of this case is known in the trade as \"market timing.\" Market timing is the practice of frequent buying and selling of shares of a single mutual fund in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing. According to the SEC, market timing, though not illegal per se, can harm other fund investors and, therefore, is commonly barred (or at least restricted) by those in charge of mutual funds.</p>\n<p>The Columbia Funds' prospectuses contained representations touching upon the subject of market timing. Starting at least as early as 1998, language was inserted into many Columbia Funds' prospectuses restricting the number and frequency of round-trips (<i>i.e.,</i> exchanges from one fund to another and back again) in which an investor could indulge. Emblematic of this prophylaxis was language, first appearing in May of 1999, inserted in prospectuses for funds belonging to the Acorn Fund Group, a constituent of the Columbia Funds. That language stated that the funds within the group \"do not permit market-timing and have adopted policies to discourage this practice.\"</p>\n<p>This effort to curb market timing escalated over time. In 2000, Hussey co-chaired an internet working group formed to create procedures designed to detect and deter market timing in the Columbia Funds. The working group ultimately recommended that each of the member funds take a consistent position against market timing in future prospectuses. As a result, a number of funds began to include a \"strict prohibition\" in every prospectus, expressly barring short-term or excessive trading. By 2003, the strict prohibition language, or a variant of it, appeared in all the Columbia Funds' prospectuses.</p>\n<p>The SEC alleges that, despite the language in the prospectuses expressing hostility toward market timingthe existence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*440</span> of which Tambone and Hussey allegedly either knew or recklessly ignoredthe defendants jointly and severally entered into, approved, and/or knowingly permitted arrangements allowing certain preferred customers to engage in market timing forays in at least sixteen different Columbia Funds during the relevant period. The SEC also alleges that the defendants used the prospectuses in their sales efforts by allowing them to be disseminated and referring potential clients to them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</h2>\n<p>On May 19, 2006, the SEC filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.<sup>[1]</sup> In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Tambone and Hussey had violated section 17(a) of the Securities Act, section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the SEC alleged that the defendants had aided and abetted primary violations of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by Columbia Advisors and Columbia Distributor, primary violations of section 15(c) of the Exchange Act by Columbia Distributor, and primary violations of section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. § 80b-6, by Columbia Advisors.</p>\n<p>In due season, each defendant moved to dismiss. The SEC opposed the motions. As the parties' arguments with respect to liability under Rule 10b-5(b) are central to this appeal, we summarize them succinctly.</p>\n<p>The defendants premised their challenge on the thesis that the SEC had failed properly to plead any actionable misstatements on their part. In opposition, the SEC countered that the complaint sufficiently alleged that the defendants had made material misrepresentations regarding market timing in the Columbia Funds' prospectuses. Specifically, the SEC argued that the defendants \"made\" false statements of material facts within the meaning of Rule 10b-5(b) by (i) participating in the drafting process that went into the development of the market timing language,<sup>[2]</sup> and (ii) using the prospectuses in their sales efforts, allowing the prospectuses to be disseminated and referring clients to them for information.<sup>[3]</sup> Finally, the SEC argued that the defendants were liable for a material omission under Rule 10b-5(b).</p>\n<p>The district court granted the motions to dismiss. <i>SEC v. Tambone</i> (<i>Tambone I</i>), 473 F.Supp.2d 162, 168 (D.Mass.2006). With respect to the Rule 10b-5(b) claim premised on the defendants' making of false statements, the court applied the bright-line test articulated in <i>Wright v. Ernst &amp; Young LLP,</i> 152 F.3d 169, 175 (2d Cir.1998), and held that the SEC's allegations about the defendants' participation in the drafting process and their subsequent use of the prospectuses were too conclusory and attenuated to satisfy the particularity requirement of Federal Rule of Civil <span class=\"star-pagination\">*441</span> Procedure 9(b). <i>Tambone I,</i> 473 F.Supp.2d at 166. The court found unconvincing the SEC's other arguments for liability under Rule 10b-5. <i>Id.</i> at 167. The court likewise rejected the SEC's section 17(a) and aiding and abetting claims. <i>Id.</i> at 167-68.</p>\n<p>The SEC appealed from the granting of the motions to dismiss with respect to its section 17(a)(2), Rule 10b-5(b), and aiding and abetting claims.</p>\n<p>With respect to Rule 10b-5(b), the SEC briefed two arguments as to how the defendants \"made\" the alleged misrepresentations. First, the SEC argued that the defendants \"made\" the misrepresentations by using the prospectuses to sell the mutual funds. Second, the SEC argued that the defendants impliedly made false representations to investors to the effect that they had a reasonable basis for believing that the key representations in the prospectuses were truthful and complete. This implied statement theory rested on the premise that a securities professional engaged in the offering of securities has a \"special duty\" to undertake an investigation that would provide him with a reasonable basis for believing that the representations in the prospectus are truthful and complete. Therefore, the theory goes, a securities professional \"makes\" an implied representation to investors that the prospectus is truthful and complete when he engages in an offering.</p>\n<p>What the SEC chose not to argue is also noteworthy. The SEC did not allude to its argument, which at one point had been raised below, that the defendants made the alleged misstatements through their involvement with the preparation of the prospectuses. Similarly, although the SEC had pleaded violations of subparagraphs (a) and (c) of Rule 10b-5, it did not pursue those claims on appeal. In accordance with our usual praxis, we deem abandoned all arguments that have not been briefed and developed on appeal. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>A divided panel of this court reversed the dismissal of the SEC's section 17(a)(2), Rule 10b-5(b), and aiding and abetting claims. <i>SEC v. Tambone</i> (<i>Tambone II</i>), 550 F.3d 106, 149 (1st Cir.2008) (withdrawn).<sup>[4]</sup> With respect to Rule 10b-5(b), the panel majority adopted the SEC's implied representation theory and held that the SEC had thereby alleged that the defendants had made false statements. <i>Id.</i> at 135.</p>\n<p>The defendants filed petitions for en banc review, Fed. R.App. P. 35, challenging all of the panel's holdings. The full court withdrew the panel opinion but ordered rehearing en banc only on the Rule 10b-5(b) issues. <i>SEC v. Tambone,</i> 573 F.3d 54, 55 (1st Cir.2009) (order granting rehearing en banc). The court declined to rehear the parties' arguments concerning either the section 17(a)(2) or the aiding and abetting rulings. <i>Id.</i> Following a new round of briefing (including helpful submissions by an array of amici) and reargument, we took the matter under advisement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's disposition of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <i>Centro Medico del Turabo,</i> 406 F.3d at 5. In the process, we accept as true all well-pleaded facts set out in the complaint and indulge all reasonable inferences in favor of the pleader. <i>In re Colonial</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*442</span> <i>Mortg. Bankers Corp.,</i> 324 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>As a general proposition, a complaint must contain no more than \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). But even though a complaint need not plead \"detailed factual allegations,\" <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), it must nonetheless \"contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\" <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, the complaint must include \"factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" <i>Id.</i> If the factual allegations in the complaint are too meager, vague, or conclusory to remove the possibility of relief from the realm of mere conjecture, the complaint is open to dismissal. <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p>Because the complaint in this case contains allegations of fraud, an additional hurdle must be surmounted: the pleader (here, the SEC) must \"state with particularity the circumstances constituting [the] fraud.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). To satisfy this particularity requirement, the pleader must set out the \"time, place, and content of the alleged misrepresentation with specificity.\" <i>Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 185, 193 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>This case presents the two-part question of whether a securities professional can be said to \"make\" a statement, such that liability under Rule 10b-5(b) may attach, either by (i) using statements to sell securities, regardless of whether those statements were crafted entirely by others, or (ii) directing the offering and sale of securities on behalf of an underwriter, thus making an implied statement that he has a reasonable basis to believe that the key representations in the relevant prospectus are truthful and complete. The answer to each part of this two-part question is \"no.\"</p>\n<p>We think it appropriate to commence our analysis with the text of the relevant statute and rule. <i>See </i><i>Cent. Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver,</i> 511 U.S. 164, 173, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994). Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act renders it unlawful for a person \"[t]o use or employ . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b). Pursuant to its rulemaking authority under section 10(b), the SEC adopted Rule 10b-5(b), which provides, in pertinent part, that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, . . . [t]o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.\" 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b). The inquiry here centers on whether the defendants made untrue statements of material fact within the meaning of this rule.</p>\n<p>In conducting this inquiry, the pivotal word in the rule's text is \"make,\" as in \"to make a statement.\" The rule itself does not define that word, nor does it suggest that the word is imbued with any exotic meaning. In the absence of either a built-in definition or some reliable indicium that the drafters intended a special nuance, accepted canons of construction teach that the word should be given its ordinary meaning. <i>See </i><i>Smith v. United States,</i> 508 U.S. 223, 228, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*443</span> 138 (1993) (\"When a word is not defined by statute, we normally construe it in accord with its ordinary or natural meaning.\"); <i>Santa Fe Indus., Inc. v. Green,</i> 430 U.S. 462, 472, 97 S.Ct. 1292, 51 L.Ed.2d 480 (1977) (interpreting Rule 10b-5 according to the \"commonly accepted meaning\" of its words); <i>In re Hill,</i> 562 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir.2009) (noting that, in general, words in a statute carry their ordinary meanings if not specially defined).</p>\n<p>One reference point for determining the ordinary meaning of a word is its accepted dictionary definition. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Smith,</i> 508 U.S. at 228-29, 113 S.Ct. 2050 (consulting various dictionaries to discern the plain meaning of the word \"use\" in the relevant statute). For purposes of this analysis, we refer to several common and representative dictionary definitions of \"make,\" which include \"create [or] cause,\" Webster's Third New Int'l Dict. 1363 (2002); \"compose,\" <i>id.;</i> and \"cause (something) to exist,\" Black's Law Dict. 1041 (9th ed.2009).</p>\n<p>This case does not require us to set forth a comprehensive test for determining when a speaker may be said to have made a statement. It is enough to say that the SEC's purported reading of the word is inconsistent with each of these definitions. In any event, the question does not turn on dictionary meanings alone. We also look to the structure of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, as well as other, related provisions, to interpret the term at issue. Chief among these structural considerations is the relationship between section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b). Section 10(b) grants the SEC broad authority to proscribe conduct that \"use[s] or employ[s]\" any \"manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance,\" in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b).</p>\n<p>In Rule 10b-5(b), the SEC prohibited a specific subset of all \"manipulative or deceptive device[s] or contrivance[s],\" namely, untrue or misleading statements of material fact. It likewise prohibited a specific subset of all conduct that might be said to \"use or employ\" such a manipulative device or contrivance: the making of untrue or misleading statements of material fact.</p>\n<p>In light of this deliberate word choice (\"make\"), the SEC's asseveration that one can \"make\" a statement when he merely uses a statement created entirely by others cannot follow. That asseveration ignores the obvious distinction between the verbs contained in the statute (\"use,\" \"employ\") and the significantly different (and narrower) verb contained in Rule 10b-5(b) (\"make\"). Word choices have consequences, and this word choice virtually leaps off the page. There is no principled way that we can treat it as meaningless.</p>\n<p>Section 10(b) is helpful to our analysis in another way as well. That provision conferred upon the SEC authority to prohibit the \"use or employ[ment]\" of any manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. The SEC knew how to wield this authority and proscribe \"use or employ[ment]\" of a manipulative device or contrivance: in Rule 10b-5(a), it did just that, rendering it unlawful \"to employ\" a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud. <i>See</i> 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(a). That the SEC wrote this prohibition in a <i>different</i> subparagraph of the rule and selected a more inclusive verb is a telling combination. The Supreme Court remarked on this phenomenon in <i>Affiliated Ute v. United States,</i> 406 U.S. 128, 92 S.Ct. 1456, 31 L.Ed.2d 741 (1972), observing that:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he second subparagraph of the rule specifies the making of an untrue statement of a material fact and the omission to state a material fact. The first and third subparagraphs are not so restricted.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*444</span> <i>Id.</i> at 152-53, 92 S.Ct. 1456. It is not the judiciary's proper province to rewrite an administrative rule to sweep more broadly than its language permits. Thus, we must honor the limitation that the drafters deliberately built into Rule 10b-5(b).</p>\n<p>In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the SEC suggests that the broad language of the statute (\"use or employ\") requires an equally broad construction of the wording contained in Rule 10b-5(b). To support this suggestion, it touts the Supreme Court's statement that \"[t]he scope of Rule 10b-5 is coextensive with the coverage of § 10(b).\" <i>SEC v. Zandford,</i> 535 U.S. 813, 816 n. 1, 122 S.Ct. 1899, 153 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002). On that basis, the SEC posits that \"make\" must include \"use\" because the statute prohibits \"use\" and the rule perforce must prohibit all that the statute prohibits.</p>\n<p>This argument comprises more cry than wool. Most notably, it fails to account for an abecedarian point: even if Rule 10b-5 is coextensive with the coverage of section 10(b), that supposed verity does not mean that each of the subparagraphs of Rule 10b-5, taken singly, is itself coextensive with the coverage of section 10(b). That cannot be so. If it was, then each subparagraph would proscribe exactly the same conduct. They do not. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Finkel v. Docutel/Olivetti Corp.,</i> 817 F.2d 356, 359-60 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>Our view of the meaning of Rule 10b-5(b) is reinforced when we contrast the language of the rule with that of section 17(a) of the Securities Act. By way of background, the phrasing of Rule 10b-5 largely mirrors the language of section 17(a) of the Securities Act.<sup>[5]</sup> That is not happenstance; the drafters of Rule 10b-5 modeled the rule on section 17(a). <i>See </i><i>United States v. Persky,</i> 520 F.2d 283, 287 (2d Cir.1975). But there is a salient difference between the language of the rule and the language of section 17(a) with respect to the types of conduct that may render a person liable for a false statement. Section 17(a)(2) makes it unlawful \"to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact,\" 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2), whereas Rule 10b-5(b) makes it unlawful \"to make any untrue statement of a material fact,\" 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b).</p>\n<p>In short, the drafters of Rule 10b-5 had before them language that would have covered the \"use\" of an untrue statement of material fact (regardless of who created or composed the statement). The drafters easily could have copied that language. They declined to do so. Instead, the drafters who faithfully tracked section 17(a) in other respectsdeliberately eschewed the expansive language of section 17(a)(2).</p>\n<p>The import of this eschewal is clear: although section 17(a)(2) may fairly be read to cover the \"use\" of an untrue statement to obtain money or property, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Edward J. Mawod &amp; Co. v. SEC,</i> 591 F.2d 588, 596 (10th Cir.1979), Rule 10b-5(b) is more narrowly crafted and its reach does not extend that far.<sup>[6]</sup> We must honor <span class=\"star-pagination\">*445</span> the drafters' deliberate decision to insert the word \"make\" in Rule 10b-5(b) in lieu of the more expansive phrase \"by means of.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ahlers,</i> 305 F.3d 54, 59-60 (1st Cir.2002) (discussing court's obligation to \"presume that . . . differential draftsmanship was deliberate\").</p>\n<p>The SEC's other arguments for defining \"make\" to encompass \"use\" with respect to Rule 10b-5(b) liability are unavailing. One of the SEC's main arguments appears to be that \"[i]t seems self-evident that any statute or rule that prohibits making a false statement in connection with the sale of property would cover a seller who knowingly uses misleading sales materials.\" This type of abstract, decontextualized approach to the interpretation of a statute or regulation is ill-suited to the construction of a rule laden with over sixty years of interpretation in literally hundreds of opinions. This is especially so because the rule in question is an integral part of an extensive regulatory framework forged by Congress, the SEC, and the federal courts.</p>\n<p>At any rate, what the SEC now calls \"self-evident\" is not self-evident at all. What does seem self-evident is that if the SEC intended to prohibit more than just the actual making of a false statement in Rule 10b-5(b), then it would not have employed the solitary verb \"make\" in the text of the rule.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>There is another reason to reject the SEC's interpretation; it is in tension with Supreme Court precedent. Under modern Supreme Court precedent dealing with Rule 10b-5, much turns on the distinction between primary and secondary violators. <i>See </i><i>Cent. Bank,</i> 511 U.S. at 191, 114 S.Ct. 1439. Although <i>Central Bank</i> did not address the precise issue with which we are concerned, the definition of \"make\" that we propose is compatible with <i>Central Bank</i> as it holds the line between primary and secondary liability in a manner faithful to <i>Central Bank.</i> We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>The Exchange Act does not explicitly confer a private right of action for section 10(b) violations. The Supreme Court nevertheless has found a private right of action to be implicit in the statute and the implementing rule (Rule 10b-5). <i>Sup't of Ins. of N.Y. v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co.,</i> 404 U.S. 6, 13 n. 9, 92 S.Ct. 165, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971). This right of action is not unbridled: private plaintiffs are permitted to bring suit under Rule 10b-5 against only \"primary\" violators. <i>See </i><i>Cent. Bank,</i> 511 U.S. at 177-78, 114 S.Ct. 1439.</p>\n<p>In the wake of <i>Central Bank,</i> Congress amended section 20 of the Exchange Act to clarify that the SEC may bring suit against aiders and abetters, that is, persons who knowingly provide substantial assistance to primary violators of the securities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*446</span> laws. Pub.L. 104-67, § 104, 109 Stat. 737, 757 (1995) (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78t(e)). Although the SEC has exhorted Congress to extend the same right to private parties, <i>see</i> 4 Thomas Lee Hazen, The Law of Securities Regulation 506 n. 31 (6th ed.2009), Congress has not done so. Thus, Rule 10b-5's private right of action extends only to primary violations, not to secondary violations. If <i>Central Bank's</i> carefully drawn circumscription of the private right of action is not to be hollowed and we do not think that it should be courts must be vigilant to ensure that secondary violations are not shoehorned into the category reserved for primary violations.</p>\n<p>The SEC's position poses a threat to the integrity of this dichotomy. Refined to bare essence, the SEC, through the instrumentality of Rule 10b-5(b), seeks to impose primary liability on the defendants for conduct that constitutes, at most, aiding and abetting (a secondary violation). Allowing the SEC to blur the line between primary and secondary violations in this manner would be unfaithful to the taxonomy of <i>Central Bank.</i></p>\n<p>Of course, the <i>Central Bank</i> Court did not purpose to decide the precise issue before us. Withal, the Court's methodology for determining the scope of the private right of action (and, thus, the scope of primary liability) is a beacon by which we must steer. That methodology emphasizes fidelity to the text of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <i>See </i><i>Cent. Bank,</i> 511 U.S. at 173, 114 S.Ct. 1439 (explaining that a \"private plaintiff may not bring a 10b-5 suit against a defendant for acts not prohibited by the text of § 10(b)\"); <i>see also id.</i> (\"We have refused to allow 10b-5 challenges to conduct not prohibited by the text of the statute.\").<sup>[8]</sup> An expansive reading of the rule, unmoored from its text and based on judicially manufactured policy rationales, is plainly antithetic to this restrained methodology. <i>See id.</i> at 188, 114 S.Ct. 1439 (warning that, absent the prospect of a bizarre result, policy considerations cannot override the text and structure of the statute).</p>\n<p>There is more. Reading \"make\" to include the use of a false statement by one other than the maker would extend primary liability beyond the scope of conduct prohibited by the text of Rule 10b-5(b). <i>See id.</i> Furthermore, doing so would \"add a gloss to the operative language of the [rule] quite different from its commonly accepted meaning.\" <i>Id.</i> at 174, 114 S.Ct. 1439 (quoting <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</i> 425 U.S. 185, 199, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976)). Allowing courts to imply that \"X\" has made a false statement with only a factual allegation that he passed along what someone else wrote would flout a core principle that underpins the <i>Central Bank</i> decision. We decline the SEC's invitation to go down that road.</p>\n<p>As an aside, blurring the line between primary and secondary violations also would create unacceptable tension with the substantial body of case law that has evolved post-<i>Central Bank</i>case law that maps the outer boundaries of primary liability under Rule 10b-5. This case law, though not directly on point, does not fit comfortably with the view that the SEC espouses here. Let us explain.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*447</span> In the aftermath of <i>Central Bank,</i> several courts of appeals have had to plot the line between primary violations and mere aiding and abetting in Rule 10b-5 actions brought by private plaintiffs. Two divergent strains of authority have evolved. We have not yet chosen between these divergent strains and we have no need to do so today. It suffices to say that the line of authority most hospitable to the establishment of primary violations of Rule 10b-5 embraces the \"substantial participation\" test, under which a person's \"substantial participation or intricate involvement in the preparation of fraudulent statements\" is enough to establish a primary violation. <i>Howard v. Everex Sys., Inc.,</i> 228 F.3d 1057, 1061 n. 5 (9th Cir.2000). The other line of authority, less hospitable to plaintiffs, adheres to the \"bright-line\" test, under which a primary violation requires proof both that the defendant actually made a false or misleading statement and that it was attributable to him at the time of public dissemination. <i>See </i><i>Wright,</i> 152 F.3d at 175; <i>see also </i><i>Ziemba v. Cascade Int'l, Inc.,</i> 256 F.3d 1194, 1205 (11th Cir. 2001); <i>Anixter v. Home-Stake Prod. Co.,</i> 77 F.3d 1215, 1226 (10th Cir.1996); <i>In re Kendall Sq. Research Corp. Sec. Litig.,</i> 868 F.Supp. 26, 28 n. 2 (D.Mass.1994).</p>\n<p>While these tests are designed for private litigation, and, thus, are poorly suited to public enforcement actions,<sup>[9]</sup> one thing is crystal clear. The conduct for which the SEC strives to hold the defendants as primary violatorsthe use and dissemination of prospectuses created by others does not satisfy either test. Both tests focus, albeit to different degrees, on the actual role that a defendant played in creating, composing, or causing the existence of an untrue statement of material fact. The SEC's attempt to impute statements to persons who may not have had any role in their creation, composition, or preparation falls well short.<sup>[10]</sup> As the Second Circuit put it: \"If <i>Central Bank</i> is to have any real meaning, a defendant must actually make a false or misleading statement in order to be held liable [as a primary violator] under section 10(b). Anything short of such conduct is merely aiding and abetting.\" <i>Shapiro v. Cantor,</i> 123 F.3d 717, 720 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>There is yet another problem with the SEC's implied statement theory: that theory effectively imposes upon securities professionals who work for underwriters an unprecedented duty. We elaborate on this mischief below.</p>\n<p>The SEC notes, correctly, that securities professionals working for underwriters have a duty to investigate the nature and circumstances of an offering. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>SEC v. Dain Rauscher, Inc.,</i> 254 F.3d 852, 857 (9th Cir.2001). Building on this foundation, the SEC theorizes that such securities professionals impliedly \"make\" a representation to investors that the statements in a prospectus are truthful and complete. If we were to give credence to this theory, the upshot would be to impose primary liability under Rule 10b-5(b) on these securities professionals whenever they fail to disclose material information <span class=\"star-pagination\">*448</span> not included in a prospectus, regardless of who prepared the prospectus. That would be tantamount to imposing a free-standing and unconditional duty to disclose. The imposition of such a duty flies in the teeth of Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p>The key precedent is <i>Chiarella v. United States,</i> 445 U.S. 222, 100 S.Ct. 1108, 63 L.Ed.2d 348 (1980). It instructs that a party's nondisclosure of information to another is actionable under Rule 10b-5 only when there is an <i>independent</i> duty to disclose the information arising from \"a fiduciary or other similar relation of trust and confidence\" between the parties. <i>Id.</i> at 228, 100 S.Ct. 1108. As the Fourth Circuit explained, \"the duty to disclose material facts arises only when there is some basis outside the securities laws, such as state law, for finding a fiduciary or other confidential relationship.\" <i>Fortson v. Winstead, McGuire, Sechrest &amp; Minick,</i> 961 F.2d 469, 472 (4th Cir.1992); <i>accord </i><i>SEC v. Cochran,</i> 214 F.3d 1261, 1264 (10th Cir.2000). Adopting the SEC's implied statement theory would pave the way for suits against securities professionals for nondisclosure of material information without the required showing of a fiduciary relationship. Fidelity to that requirement demands that we reject the SEC's notion that a breach of a duty to investigate, without more, is a breach of a duty to disclose (and, thus, should be treated as a primary violation under Rule 10b-5(b)).</p>\n<p>The SEC labors to depict its implied statement theory as firmly rooted in both case law and longstanding administrative interpretation. This depiction is inaccurate.</p>\n<p>As to case law, the SEC relies principally on three decisions. <i>See </i><i>Dolphin &amp; Bradbury, Inc. v. SEC,</i> 512 F.3d 634, 641 (D.C.Cir.2008); <i>Sanders v. John Nuveen &amp; Co.,</i> 524 F.2d 1064, 1070 (7th Cir.1975); <i>Chris-Craft Indus., Inc. v. Piper Aircraft Corp.,</i> 480 F.2d 341, 370 (2d Cir.1973). These decisions, it asserts, stand for the linchpin proposition that an underwriter participating in an offering makes an implied statement, potentially actionable under Rule 10b-5(b), that he has a reasonable basis for believing that the prospectus is truthful and complete.</p>\n<p>That assertion is incorrect. To begin, neither <i>Dolphin</i> nor <i>Sanders</i> holds that an underwriter may be found liable as a primary violator under Rule 10b-5(b) for \"making\" an implied representation that proves to be false. Those cases did not present any issue as to whether the underwriter had \"made\" a statement. In fact, in both cases the underwriter personally made the misrepresentations. <i>See </i><i>Dolphin,</i> 512 F.3d at 638, 640; <i>Sanders,</i> 524 F.2d at 1067; <i>see also </i><i>Sanders v. John Nuveen &amp; Co.,</i> 619 F.2d 1222, 1224 (7th Cir.1980). Both decisions were directed toward a wholly distinct issue: whether the defendant acted with the required state of mind in making the statements. <i>See </i><i>Dolphin,</i> 512 F.3d at 639; <i>Sanders,</i> 524 F.2d at 1066. Any language suggesting that various representations might be imputed to underwriters must be viewed in this (very different) context.</p>\n<p><i>Chris-Craft</i> also fails to breathe life into the SEC's argument. The case holds that an underwriter's constructive representation that the statements made in registration materials are truthful and complete constitutes the making of a statement under section 14(e) of the Exchange Act.<sup>[11]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*449</span> <i>See </i><i>Chris-Craft,</i> 480 F.2d at 370. But <i>Chris-Craft</i> preceded <i>Central Bank</i> by over twenty years, and its continued vitality with respect to this section 14(e) holding is doubtful.</p>\n<p>In all events, nothing turned on the distinction between primary and secondary violations at that time, so the <i>Chris-Craft</i> panel had no reason to distinguish between them. In retrospect, it is reasonable to read <i>Chris-Craft</i> as holding that the underwriters were liable only as secondary violators. <i>See </i><i>In re MTC Elec. Techs. S'holder Litig.,</i> 993 F.Supp. 160, 162 (E.D.N.Y.1997) (concluding that \"the holding of <i>Chris-Craft</i> was that an underwriter was liable as an aider and abettor\").</p>\n<p>We turn next to the array of administrative pronouncements. We freely accept the principle that the existence of a longstanding pattern of administrative interpretation might well call for <i>Chevron</i> deference. <i>See </i><i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Here, however, the SEC's claim of a \"longstanding administrative interpretation\" is wildly exaggerated.</p>\n<p>The SEC has cobbled together a bricolage of agency decisions and statements all of which antedate <i>Central Bank.</i> Without exception, nothing in this carefully culled collection says that an implied representation of an underwriter can constitute a basis for primary liability under Rule 10b-5(b). The fact that the SEC has never before articulated the implied statement theory as a basis for Rule 10b-5(b) liability dooms its quest for <i>Chevron</i> deference. After all, there is no occasion for <i>Chevron</i> deference when there is nothing to which a court may defer.</p>\n<p>Before leaving this topic, we wish to comment briefly on the dissent's metronomic reliance on the special role and duties of underwriters. We agree that underwriters have a special niche in the marketing of securities and, thus, have a special set of responsibilities. But the duty that the dissent seeks to impose is unprecedentedand far exceeds the scope of Rule 10b-5(b). While that rule could have been drafted to cut a wider swath, it was not. The SEC has other, more appropriate tools that it may use to police the parade of horribilis that the dissent envisions, and it is neither necessary nor wise to attempt to expand the rule by judicial fiat. Most importantly, doing so would, as a matter of law, be wrong.</p>\n<p>There is one loose end, which relates to waiver. The SEC argues to the en banc court that the defendants can be held primarily liable for violating Rule 10b-5(b) under an entanglement test. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Cabletron Sys., Inc.,</i> 311 F.3d 11, 37-38 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Elkind v. Liggett &amp; Myers, Inc.,</i> 635 F.2d 156, 163 (2d Cir.1980). Under this test, a defendant may be held primarily liable for misstatements appearing in reports authored by outside analysts when those misrepresentations are based on information provided by the defendant. <i>See </i><i>Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 38. Such liability inheres when \"defendants have expressly or impliedly adopted the statements, placed their imprimatur on the statements, or have otherwise entangled themselves with the analysts to a significant degree.\" <i>Id.</i> at 37-38.</p>\n<p>This argument has not been preserved and, thus, need not concern us. The SEC did not advance it before the district court in connection with the dispositive motions to dismiss. To make a bad situation worse, the SEC did not coherently present this argument before the panel during the first stage of this appeal. To the contrary, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*450</span> the SEC's panel briefs were devoid not only of any developed argumentation to the effect that the defendants entangled themselves with the statements in the prospectuses but also of citations to <i>Cabletron, Elkind,</i> or any comparable precedent. In this instance, silence speak volumes.</p>\n<p>A party cannot switch horses mid-stream, changing its theory of liability at a later stage of the litigation in hopes of securing a swifter steed. So it is here: because the SEC unfurled its \"entanglement\" argument for the first time in the en banc proceedings, we have no occasion to address that argument. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Slade,</i> 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\"); <i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17 (explaining that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\").</p>\n<p>This is not the only waiver that has transpired. The SEC unveiled for the first time in its reply brief regarding rehearing en banc a contention that its implied statement theory of Rule 10b-5(b) liability could be upheld under the so-called shingle theory. <i>See, e.g., Duker &amp; Duker,</i> 6 S.E.C. 386, 388-89, 1939 WL 36426 (1939).<sup>[12]</sup> This belated contention is likewise waived.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. This is one of those happy occasions when the language and structure of a rule, the statutory framework that it implements, and the teachings of the Supreme Court coalesce to provide a well-lit decisional path. Following that path, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the SEC's Rule 10b-5(b) claim. Because en banc review is limited to this claim, we reinstate those portions of the vacated panel judgment that reversed the dismissal of the SEC's section 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting claims. To that end, we also reinstate those portions of the withdrawn panel opinion, and concurrence thereto, addressing those claims (which, when reinstated, will have the force ordinarily associated with panel opinions). We remand the case to the district court for further proceedings on the SEC's section 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting claims consistent, of course, with this en banc opinion.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge, with whom LYNCH, Chief Judge, joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>A \"plain language\" approach to statutory construction has well-known adherents, andin construing the SEC's rule at issue (\"make any untrue statement of a material fact\")bare wording forcefully supports Judge Selya's thorough and persuasive decision. Yet even a more elastic \"all things considered\" reading of the rule's language would not justify the alarmingly ambitious use of it that the agency seeks to deploy in this case.</p>\n<p>The word \"make,\" in reference to a statement, ordinarily refers to one authoring the statement or repeating it as his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*451</span> own; one who lends to a friend a book is not normally deemed to \"make\" the statements in the book. <i>See </i><i>Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Credit Suisse First Boston (USA), Inc.,</i> 482 F.3d 372, 384 n. 20 (5th Cir.2007). There is some breathing room: for example, imagine an underwriter orally or in writing specifically affirming to an investor the truth of specific statements in a prospectus that he knew to be false.</p>\n<p>Here, the SEC propounds a far more expansive view: it asks the courts to treat securities professionals as a matter of course as impliedly representing the entire contents of prospectuses whenever they sell securities or assist those who do. The argument against so sweeping a position begins with language, but it does not end there: congressional policy, Supreme Court precedent, practical consequences and the nearly uniform view of circuit courts that have spoken all argue against the SEC's proposed interpretation. It helps focus the issue, and underscores the reach of the SEC's position, to recite briefly the SEC's allegationsboth those rejected and not appealed, and those on appealas to Tambone and Hussey's relationship to and use of the Columbia Funds prospectuses.</p>\n<p>Tambone and Hussey were officers of Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc. (\"Columbia Distributor\"), which served as principal underwriter for Columbia mutual funds. As underwriters, they were required by law to furnish prospectuses to broker-dealers selling Columbia funds and to investors to whom they sold directly. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. § 77e(b) (2006); 17 C.F.R. § 240.15c2-8(b) (2009). The prospectuses, however, were drafted by a separate entity, Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. (\"Columbia Advisors\"), and the SEC admits in its complaint that Columbia Advisors rather than Columbia Distributor (and hence the defendants) \"remained primarily responsible for all representations made in the prospectuses for those funds.\"</p>\n<p>The SEC's more specific allegations concern the creation of the prospectuses and, separately, their use. The SEC complaint charged that the defendants were \"involved in the process of revising the prospectuses,\" \"reviewed the market timing representations before they were included in the prospectuses\" and \"comment[ed] on these representations to in-house counsel for Columbia Advisors.\" The district court found that these allegations failed to plead fraud with requisite particularity, <i>SEC v. Tambone,</i> 473 F.Supp.2d 162, 165-66 (D.Mass.2006); the SEC does not now challenge this determination.</p>\n<p>As to the use of the prospectuses, the SEC initially argued that Tambone and Columbia Distributor \"signed hundreds of [selling] agreements\" with broker-dealers that expressly represented and warranted that \"each Prospectus and all sales literature. . . [would] not by statement or omission be misleading.\" The district court again found that these allegations \"flatly fail[ed]\" to meet the particularity requirements. <i>Tambone,</i> 473 F.Supp.2d at 167. The SEC does not argue otherwise, nor does it point to any other specific oral or written statements made by the two defendants.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>The SEC's remaining allegations regarding the defendants' use of the prospectuses, which are before us, are simply that the defendants, as required, disseminated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*452</span> prospectuses to broker-dealers and investors in their capacity as underwriters. The SEC does not say that the defendants explicitly represented as true to investors the prospectuses' market timing provisions or that they even discussed the prospectuses with investors. The SEC instead claims that in selling securities, a defendant who neither personally authorized nor repeated an inaccurate statement nevertheless \"make[s]\" an implied statement or representation under Rule 10b-5(b) that the prospectuses prepared by the issuer are in all respects accurate and not materially misleading.</p>\n<p>Following <i>Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A.,</i> 511 U.S. 164, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994), Congress gave the SEC alone statutory authority to bring actions against individuals who aided and abetted a section 10(b) violation, 15 U.S.C. § 78t(e); and this authority might be used to charge one who distributed a false prospectus knowing that it contained false statements. The SEC's position in this case would undo this deliberate legislative compromise, <i>see</i> S.Rep. No. 104-98, at 19 (1995), and it would conflict with practically all of the pertinent circuit cases.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>While the defendants in this case held significant positions, there is no obvious stopping point: virtually anyone involved in the underwriting process might under the SEC's \"making a statement\" theory be charged and subject to liability in a suit under section 10(b). The SEC may select its defendants sensibly; but private litigants have their own incentives, and the SEC concedes that its definition of \"make,\" if adopted, would apply to private party actions as well. The Supreme Court has repeatedly acknowledged the unique risk of \"vexatious\" securities litigation,<sup>[15]</sup> and it has likewise cautioned against extending further the court-created private remedy under section 10(b). <i>See </i><i>Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,</i> 552 U.S. 148, 165, 128 S.Ct. 761, 169 L.Ed.2d 627 (2008); <i>accord </i><i>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</i> 425 U.S. 185, 199-201, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976).</p>\n<p>Nothing justifies the adventure proposed by the agency. The conduct charged is already covered by an aiding and abetting remedy available to the SEC itself. 15 U.S.C. § 78t(e). Sections 11 and 12 of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77k, 77l, allow private suitsbut with important limitationsagainst underwriters who fail to make reasonable investigations into the prospectuses they distribute. And private litigants are free to sue the actual authors of misstatements in the prospectus under section 10(b) itself. <i>See</i> note 1, above.</p>\n<p>More than enough is too much. No one sophisticated about markets believes that multiplying liability is free of cost. And <span class=\"star-pagination\">*453</span> the cost, initially borne by those who raise capital or provide audit or other services to companies, gets passed along to the public. <i>Cent. Bank,</i> 511 U.S. at 189, 114 S.Ct. 1439; Winter, <i>Paying Lawyers, Empowering Prosecutors, and Protecting Managers: Raising the Cost of Capital in America,</i> 42 Duke L.J. 945, 962 (1993). Congress and the Supreme Court have struck a balance; the SEC is obliged to respect it.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, with whom TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, joins, dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>The majority acknowledges that the Supreme Court in <i>Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A.,</i> 511 U.S. 164, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994), \"did not purpose to decide the precise issue before us\"what it means to \"make\" a statementbut asserts that a construction of \"make\" that embraces the conduct alleged in this case would be at odds with <i>Central Bank's</i> careful distinction between primary and secondary liability. There is no such conflict. My colleagues overstate the significance of <i>Central Bank</i> for the interpretive issue before us, fail to account for the underwriter's unique statutory duty to provide investors with accurate information, and misguidedly allow concerns about excessive private litigation to influence their judgment on the scope of public enforcement by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In my view, the language of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b), the underwriter's role and duties in the securities market, and decades of case lawincluding <i>Central Bank</i>inescapably permit the SEC to proceed against Tambone and Hussey for making false statements within the purview of Rule 10b-5(b). I therefore respectfully dissent.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The important issue before the en banc court is whether the defendants' <i>use</i> of false and misleading prospectus statements can constitute the <i>making</i> of statements that render the defendants primarily liable under Rule 10b-5(b). The Commission asserts that, as senior executives of the primary underwriter for the Columbia Funds, Tambone and Hussey had a duty to confirm the accuracy and completeness of the prospectuses they were responsible for distributing to broker-dealers and potential investors. It further contends that, by using the prospectuses as required to perform their duties to potential investors, defendants made implied statements asserting that they had a reasonable basis to believe that the key statements in the prospectuses regarding market timing were accurate and complete. Because the defendants allegedly knew that those statements were false, or were reckless in not knowing, their implied statements were also false. The SEC argues that these direct representations of Tambone and Hussey, albeit implied, subject the defendants to primary liability under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b).</p>\n<p>The majority dismisses the SEC's position as untenable on the basis of \"the language and structure of [the] rule, the statutory framework that it implements, and the teachings of the Supreme Court.\" It is the majority's view that is untenable. It construes the Rule to exclude the long accepted understanding that underwriters \"make\" implied statements to investors about the accuracy and completeness of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*454</span> prospectuses they are using to induce investments. It rejects primary liability for fraudulent conduct at the heart of Rule 10b-5's prohibitions by stretching <i>Central Bank</i> beyond both its text and context and using that unjustified expansion to justify its contraction of the Rule's scope.</p>\n<p>As I shall explain, the language of the statute and the Rule, viewed in the context of the unique role of underwriters in selling securities, supports the Commission's allegation that Tambone and Hussey made implied statements to investors that are actionable as primary violations of Rule 10b-5(b). I begin, however, by addressing the premise at the heart of the majority's positionits unfounded assumption that <i>Central Bank's</i> \"carefully drawn circumscription of the private right of action\" substantially changed the landscape for securities claims under Rule 10b-5 in the very different context of an SEC enforcement action against underwriters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Central Bank</i> and Rule 10b-5</h2>\n<p>The majority argues that reading Rule 10b-5(b) to reach the making of implied statements would be to disregard the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Central Bank</i> and to effectively eliminate the boundaries between primary and secondary liability required by that decision. This contention overstates the substance of the case and, consequently, its reach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. What the Court Decided</h2>\n<p>The issue in <i>Central Bank</i> was whether the bank, the indenture trustee for bonds issued by the public Building Authority to finance improvements at a planned development in Colorado Springs, could be held liable in a private cause of action under Rule 10b-5 for aiding and abetting a primary violation of the law. Although Central Bank had become aware that the collateral for the bonds had likely become insufficient to support them, it delayed undertaking an independent review of the original appraisal. Before an independent review could be done, the Building Authority defaulted on a portion of the bonds.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff raised claims of primary liability against four violators: the Building Authority, which issued the defaulted bonds in question, two underwriters for the bonds, and a director of the development company in charge of providing an appraisal of the bonds. The Building Authority defaulted early in the litigation and the claims against the underwriters were settled. <i>See </i><i>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A. v. Pring,</i> 969 F.2d 891, 893 n. 1 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court, relying on the text of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, concluded that the aiding and abetting claims against Central Bank had to be dismissed because <i>private</i> plaintiffs may only bring claims of primary liability, not aiding and abetting liability. Nevertheless, the Court noted that \"[i]n any complex securities fraud . . . there are likely to be multiple violators; in this case, for example, respondents named four defendants as primary violators.\"<sup>[17]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*455</span> 511 U.S. at 191, 114 S.Ct. 1439. Finally, the Court concluded that it is not the identity of a securities actor but his conduct that determines whether he may be liable as a primary violator:</p>\n<blockquote>The absence of § 10(b) aiding and abetting liability does not mean that secondary actors in the securities markets are always free from liability under the securities Acts. Any person or entity, including a lawyer, accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator under 10b-5, assuming all of the requirements for primary liability under Rule 10b-5 are met.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. What the Court Did Not Decide</h2>\n<p>The Court in <i>Central Bank</i> addressed only the question of \"whether private civil liability under § 10(b) extends as well to those who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptive practice, but who aid and abet the violation.\" 511 U.S. at 167, 114 S.Ct. 1439; <i>see also id.</i> at 176, 114 S.Ct. 1439 (\"The problem, of course, is that aiding and abetting liability extends beyond persons who engage, even indirectly, in a proscribed activity; aiding and abetting liability reaches persons who do not engage in the proscribed activities at all, but who give a degree of aid to those who do.\"). The issue here is whether the defendants <i>themselves</i> \"engage[d] in the manipulative or deceptive practice,\" i.e., whether the defendants' acts are \"sufficient to show that they `made' the [alleged] material misstatements and omissions . . . such that they can be held primarily liable.\" <i>SEC v. Wolfson,</i> 539 F.3d 1249, 1258 (10th Cir.2008). Holding Tambone and Hussey responsible for their own false implied statements does not threaten the primary/secondary dichotomy.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is critical to recognize that <i>Central Bank</i> analyzes the scope of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 in a suit brought by a private plaintiff. Although the Court focused on the text of the provisions, it also emphasized the element of reliance (which was not satisfied in that case), as well as a set of policy considerations that arise exclusively in the context of private securities litigation. <i>See</i> 511 U.S. at 173-178, 180, 188-89, 114 S.Ct. 1439. In this respect, <i>Central Bank</i> reflected the Court's desire to limit the scope of the judicially implied private cause of action under Rule 10b-5.<sup>[18]</sup> Indeed, the Court has consistently distinguished between the broad contours of the SEC's \"express statutory authority to enforce [Rule 10b-5],\" <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith v. Dabit,</i> 547 U.S. 71, 79-81, 126 S.Ct. 1503, 164 L.Ed.2d 179 (2006), and the \"narrow dimensions\" of the implied private right of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*456</span> action, <i>Stoneridge,</i> 552 U.S. at 167, 128 S.Ct. 761; <i>see also </i><i>SEC v. Zandford,</i> 535 U.S. 813, 819, 122 S.Ct. 1899, 153 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002) (noting, in a Commission action, that the Securities Exchange Act, including § 10(b), \"should be `construed \"not technically and restrictively, but flexibly to effectuate its remedial purposes\"'\") (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Thus, as the SEC argues, \"[p]olicy considerations concerning private litigation can have no relevance in defining the scope of primary liability under Section 10(b) in a Commission enforcement action.\" The Court's restrictive application of Rule 10b-5 in <i>Central Bank</i>a case brought by a private plaintiffcannot sensibly be stretched beyond its logic to invalidate, in an SEC enforcement action, an interpretation of an element of Rule 10b-5(b) on which the Supreme Court was silent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Distinguishing between Primary and Secondary Violations</h2>\n<p>Although the private action context limits <i>Central Bank's</i> significance for the SEC enforcement action at issue here, the Court did effect an important change in securities law by holding that aiding and abetting claims were no longer available in private actions. In its aftermath, lower courts sought to delineate the outer boundaries of primary liability, an issue the Supreme Court had not addressed. As the majority notes, our sister circuits have crafted two divergent standards to analyze the question: the \"bright-line\" test, associated most closely with the Second Circuit, and the broader \"substantial participation\" test, articulated by the Ninth Circuit. The majority observes that it is unnecessary to choose one of these paths in this case because the conduct at issue\"the use and dissemination of prospectuses created by others\"does not satisfy either test. I agree that there is no need to choose between these standards, but for a different reason: neither the bright-line nor substantial participation test is relevant here.</p>\n<p>The substantial participation test evaluates whether one actor can be deemed to have made a statement made or created by another because of the actor's \"substantial participation\" in the making or creation of that statement. In this case, the SEC alleges that Tambone and Hussey are accountable for their own implied statements, making the \"substantial participation\" inquiry unnecessary. <i>See In re LDK Solar Sec. Litig.,</i> No. C07-05182WHA, 2008 WL 4369987, at *8 n. 9 (N.D.Cal. Sept.24, 2008) (declining to address defendants' claim that they had not \"substantially participated\" in making the fraudulent statements at issue because the court had already determined that they should be \"deemed actually to have made those statements\"). Similarly, the bright line test does not address what it means to \"make\" a statement. It simply requires that the defendant \"actually make\" the statement at issue, <i>Wright v. Ernst &amp; Young LLP,</i> 152 F.3d 169, 175 (2d Cir. 1998), and it imposes an attribution requirement that is inapplicable to SEC enforcement actions because it relates to the element of reliance that is required only in a private Rule 10b-5 action. <i>See </i><i>Wolfson,</i> 539 F.3d at 1259-60 (observing that the attribution requirement \"stems directly from the need for <i>private</i> litigants to prove reliance on alleged fraud to succeed on a <i>private</i> cause of action\").</p>\n<p>Whether or not these tests are useful in distinguishing primary from secondary conduct, they shed no light on the issue that is before us: determining whether the defendants have \"made\" a statement, which unquestionably would subject them to primary liability.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*457</span> 4. The Limited Relevance of <i>Central Bank</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court in <i>Central Bank</i> focused on the crucial dichotomy between those who, regardless of their role in a securities transaction, make misleading representations themselves, and those who assist the culpable actor without personally using or employing any \"manipulative or deceptive device\" as prohibited by section 10(b). In this SEC enforcement action, primary liability is premised on the defendants' having themselves impliedly stated that they had a reasonable basis to believe that the market timing disclosures in the prospectuses were truthful and complete.</p>\n<p><i>Central Bank</i> does not address the important issue in this casewhether the defendants \"made\" statements within the meaning of Rule 10b-5(b)and we must look elsewhere for guidance. As I describe below, both the language of the Rule and substantial precedent on the role and status of underwriters in the distribution of securities support the SEC's argument that Tambone's and Hussey's alleged actions fall within the purview of the \"make a statement\" requirement of Rule 10b-5(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Scope of Liability under Rule 10b-5(b): Making a Statement</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Text of Section 10(b)</h2>\n<p>Although Rule 10b-5 itself offers little guidance on how to define \"make,\" the text of section 10(b), its authorizing statute, also must be examined. <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</i> 425 U.S. 185, 197, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976) (\"In addressing [the question of the proper scienter requirement under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5], we turn first to the language of s 10(b), for `(t)he starting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.'\" (quoting <i>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores,</i> 421 U.S. 723, 756, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring))); <i>Pinter v. Dahl,</i> 486 U.S. 622, 653, 108 S.Ct. 2063, 100 L.Ed.2d 658 (1988) (\"The ascertainment of congressional intent with respect to the scope of liability created by a particular section of the Securities Act must rest primarily on the language of that section.\"). The statutory language is particularly relevant in this case because \"[t]he scope of Rule 10b-5 is coextensive with the coverage of § 10(b),\" a view that has led the Supreme Court to \"use § 10(b) to refer to both the statutory provision and the Rule.\" <i>Zandford,</i> 535 U.S. at 816 n. 1, 122 S.Ct. 1899; <i>see also </i><i>Stoneridge,</i> 552 U.S. at 157, 128 S.Ct. 761 (\"Rule 10b-5 encompasses only conduct already prohibited by § 10(b).\").</p>\n<p>In other words, the term \"<i>make</i> a statement\" in Rule 10b-5<sup>[19]</sup> must be read in conjunction with the text of section 10(b), which deems it \"unlawful for any person. . . [t]o <i>use or employ,</i> in connection with the purchase or sale of any security . . ., any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) (emphasis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*458</span> added). The SEC's allegations against appellants are stated in precisely those statutory terms. The SEC avers that defendants <i>used</i> and <i>employed</i> prospectuses containing statements prohibiting market timing practicesstatements that they knew or were reckless in not knowing were falseand in so doing impliedly stated that they had a reasonable basis to believe that the market timing disclosures in the prospectuses were truthful and complete.</p>\n<p>The majority counters that one cannot \"`make' a statement when he merely uses a statement created entirely by others.\" It asserts that subsection (b) of Rule 10b-5 applies to only a subset of the conduct that falls within the statute's proscriptioni.e., only the literal \"making\" of statements and not all \"uses\" of them. <i>Id.</i> The majority reinforces this pronouncement by pointing out that another section of the Rule, 10b-5(a), <i>does</i> prohibit the \"employ[ment]\" of any \"device, scheme or artifice to defraud,\" and it concludes that this difference in language proves that subsection (b) of the Rule was deliberately framed as a narrower prohibition against \"making,\" but not \"using,\" statements.</p>\n<p>The question before us is not whether the words \"use\" and \"make\" are interchangeable, howeverI agree they are notbut whether the conduct that occurred here could constitute \"making\" a statement within the meaning of Rule 10b-5(b). The majority's position is that one cannot make a statement without explicitly speaking or writing the words at issue. The statutory language, howeverprohibiting the \"use,\" inter alia, of \"deceptive device[s]\"is broad enough to encompass less literal forms of \"making\" a statement. Indeed, it defies ordinary experience to say that a statement can only be \"made\" by \"the physical or manual act of writing or transcribing [a] report\" or speaking words. <i>State v. O'Neil,</i> 24 Idaho 582, 135 P. 60, 63 (1913). It is a commonplace observation that someone has \"made a statement\" through his or her conduct.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, a broader reading of \"make\" also is consistent with the dictionary definitions, which are more inclusive than the majority acknowledges and include \"deliver, utter, or put forth.\" <i>See The Random House Dictionary of the English Language</i> 1161 (2d ed.1987). Those meanings embrace the SEC's argument that, by using the prospectuses as they did, the defendants \"deliver[ed]\" or \"put forth\" implied statements of their own attesting to the accuracy and completeness of the prospectuses. In case law, as well as common parlance, this is not an unprecedented interpretation of the word \"make.\" In <i>Reass v. United States,</i> 99 F.2d 752 (4th Cir.1938), for example, the court held that \"making\" a false statement for purposes of a federal mortgage fraud statute meant communicating it and not merely composing it. <i>Id.</i> at 755. Although the majority correctly points out the very different context in <i>Reass,</i> the fact remains that the court did not confine \"making a statement\" to the literal meaning on which the majority insists. <i>See also, e.g., </i><i>O'Neil,</i> 135 P. at 63.</p>\n<p>To be sure, Rule 10b-5(b) contemplates some range of conduct narrower than the statute's all-encompassing \"use or employ.\" But that fact does not mean that particular uses of statements by particular players in the sale of securities cannot constitute the \"making\" of implied statements. The Rule thus does not require Tambone and Hussey to have explicitly spoken or written the false statement at issue here, i.e., that \"I have a reasonable basis for believing that the market timing disclosures in the prospectuses are truthful and complete.\" Rather, given the statutory duties imposed upon them as underwriters, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> <i>see infra,</i> that representation was implicit in the defendants' conduct in using the prospectuses to induce individuals to invest in Columbia Funds.</p>\n<p>As the SEC explains in its en banc brief, this understanding of what it means to \"make\" a statement is necessary to fulfill the objective of Congress and the Commission to punish \"any untrue statement of a material fact\" made with knowledge or reckless disregard for its truth. <i>See</i> Rule 10b-5(b). An underwriter could well know that representations in a prospectus are false even when the individual who actually wrote the words was unaware of the inaccuracies. In those circumstances, an underwriter who knowingly gives investors a prospectus containing falsehoods could not be held liable in an SEC enforcement action for aiding and abetting the unwitting drafter, who did not himself commit fraud. If such an underwriter could not be held responsible as a primary offender, the underwriter would, in the SEC's words, \"be free from any liability under Section 10(b) whatsoever.\"<sup>[20]</sup> It takes no stretch of the language of Rule 10b-5(b) to view such an underwriter as having attested to the accuracy of the prospectus contents, i.e., to have knowingly \"made\" an implied falsestatement to investors that the prospectus accurately describes the fund's risks. <i>See </i><i>Hanly v. SEC,</i> 415 F.2d 589, 597 (2d Cir.1969) (\"By [an underwriter's] recommendation he implies that a reasonable investigation has been made and that his recommendation rests on the conclusions based on such investigation.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Duties of an Underwriter</h2>\n<p>In assessing whether a defendant has committed a primary violation of the securities laws, courts have examined the defendant's role in the securities market in addition to the specific conduct alleged in the complaint. These decisions indicate that a defendant's general responsibilities and statutory duties with respect to the sale and distribution of securities inform the legal significance of specific conduct under Rule 10b-5(b). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Scholastic Corp. Sec. Litig.,</i> 252 F.3d 63, 77 (2d Cir.2001) (analyzing a corporate executive's liability for \"making\" misleading statements in light of his duties and responsibilities); <i>SEC v. KPMG LLP,</i> 412 F.Supp.2d 349, 376-77 (S.D.N.Y.2006) (holding that three engagement partners of an auditing firm who possessed the \"ultimate authority to determine whether an audit opinion should be issued\" could be primarily liable under the securities laws for misstatements contained in the audit opinion letters, although a fourth defendant, who only acted as a concurring review partner, could not be held primarily liable, as his responsibilities were \"not the equivalent of the audit engagement partner's responsibilities\"). Indeed, the Second Circuit has made the particularly relevant observation that \"[s]ilence <i>where there is a duty to disclose</i> can constitute a false or misleading statement within the meaning of § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.\" <i>Wright,</i> 152 F.3d at 177 (emphasis added). Thus, by virtue of his role in the securities market and his statutory duties, a defendant may make an implied statement without actually uttering the words in question.</p>\n<p>Underwriters play an essential role in the sale and distribution of mutual funds to the investing public, which occurs either directly or through other broker-dealers. The text and statutory history of the Securities Act of 1933, and specifically the statute's treatment of underwriters in sections <span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> 11<sup>[21]</sup> and 12,<sup>[22]</sup> highlight the unique position they occupy in the securities industry. As the Southern District of New York has observed in the context of evaluating several securities claims:</p>\n<blockquote>[I]n enacting Section 11, \"Congress recognized that underwriters occupied a unique position that enabled them to discover and compel disclosure of essential facts about the offering. Congress believed that subjecting underwriters to the liability provisions would provide the necessary incentive to ensure their careful investigation of the offering.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>In re WorldCom, Inc.

Although underwriters are not insurers for offerings, <i>id.,</i> Congress has mandated that they \"exercise diligence of a type commensurate with the confidence, both as to integrity and competence, that is placed in [them].\" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 73-152, 1933 WL 984, at *26 (1933). The duty of an underwriter to conduct a reasonable investigation was explained by the SEC more than forty years ago as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"By associating himself with a proposed offering [an underwriter] impliedly represents that he has made such an investigation in accordance with professional standards.

Thus, contrary to the majority's assertion, this is not a situation in which the liability alleged is based \"merely\" on the use of \"a statement created entirely by others.\" In this limited context, where the duties of underwriters to potential investors are prescribed by statute, the knowing or reckless use of a prospectus containing false statements involves the underwriter's own implied statement falsely affirming the accuracy of the prospectus content.</p>\n<p>The majority attempts to discredit some of this inconvenient precedent because it pre-dates <i>Central Bank.</i> The majority's treatment of <i>Chris-Craft,</i> which strongly supports the SEC's position, is illustrative. The Second Circuit held that an underwriter \"makes\" a statement under section 14(e) of the Exchange Act when constructively representing that registration materials are accurate and complete.<sup>[25]</sup> 480 F.2d at 370 (noting that, although an underwriter does not \"in a literal sense\" make statements to potential investors, we do not read § 14(e) so \"narrowly\"). The majority disregards <i>Chris-Craft</i> because it preceded <i>Central Bank</i> by more than twenty years, observing that the Second Circuit had no reason to distinguish between primary and secondary liability at that time. As the SEC points out, however, and our discussion above confirms, <i>Central Bank</i> did not diminish the statutory duties of underwriters or otherwise affect the courts' identification of the duties owed by underwriters to the investing public.</p>\n<p>Hence, <i>Chris-Craft</i> and similar cases may not be cast aside as no longer relevant. The majority errs in its dismissal of precedent, fully consistent with <i>Central Bank,</i> indicating that implied statements made by underwritersa unique class of securities professionalsmay fall within the scope of Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>My colleagues fear that including implied statements within the purview of Rule 10b-5(b) would trigger a flood of vexatious private lawsuits against a wide spectrum of participants in the securities industry. I cannot deny that private plaintiffs would try to push the SEC's implied statement position beyond its context in this case. That is a predictable and familiar phenomenon in our legal system. It then becomes the responsibility of courts to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*463</span> which attempts to expand the law are meritorious and which are not. Inescapably, this method of developing the law imposes costs on defendants who ultimately prevail. These inevitable costs should not deter us, however, from reaching the result required by the applicable law in the case before us. Specifically, they should not lead us here to circumscribe the authority of the SEC to meet its responsibility to the public to prevent fraud in the securities industry.</p>\n<p>In addition, the majority's fears discount too readily the particular context of this case. As I have described, underwriters play a unique role in the securities industry, and they have responsibilities and a statutory duty not shared by every securities professional. Indeed, the cases cited in the concurrence for the proposition that the implied representation theory \"has been regularly rejected by the circuits\" all involve secondary players, such as accountants, auditors and lawyers, who typically lack the \"trail guide\" relationship with the investing public that is the hallmark of the underwriter's role.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p>Tambone's and Hussey's implied statements about their belief in the accuracy of the prospectuses arise from their special status, enforced by statute, which is both widely acknowledged and of long duration. The majority, quoting <i>Chiarella v. United States,</i> 445 U.S. 222, 228, 100 S.Ct. 1108, 63 L.Ed.2d 348 (1980), acknowledges that a duty to disclose information in the securities setting may arise from \"`a fiduciary or other similar relation of trust and confidence' between the parties\" that exists outside the obligations imposed by Rule 10b-5. <i>See </i><i>SEC v. Cochran,</i> 214 F.3d 1261, 1265 (10th Cir.2000) (noting that \"a duty to disclose under § 10(b) may be present if either a federal statute (other than § 10(b) itself) or a state statutory or common law recognizes a fiduciary or similar relationship of trust and confidence\"). Federal law imposes such a duty on underwriters,<sup>[27]</sup> and that duty provides the context in which an underwriter's conduct may generate an implied statement attesting to the accuracy of a prospectus the underwriter is using to sell securities. Plaintiffs seeking to expand the SEC's implied statement approach beyond underwriters will face the challenge of identifying an equivalent duty on the part of other actors in the securities industry.</p>\n<p>Moreover, private litigants face multiple burdens in pleading securities claims. Not only must they meet the standard requirement that allegations of fraud be pleaded with particularity, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), butunlike the SECthey also must prove reliance on the alleged misrepresentations, economic loss, and loss causation, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Stoneridge,</i> 552 U.S. at 157, 128 S.Ct. 761. The reliance requirement, in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*464</span> particular, weakens my colleagues' concern that private litigants will be able to bring impermissible aiding and abetting claims in the guise of primary claims. With significant barriers already in place to protect against excessive securities litigation by private plaintiffs, the way to protect against overreaching by private plaintiffs is to strictly enforce those requirements not to deny the SEC the full scope of its enforcement authority.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The underwriter's special duty to investors is anchored in statutes and administrative guidance and confirmed by case law whose relevant wisdom was unaffected by the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Central Bank.</i> In light of that duty, an underwriter who uses a prospectus in a securities transaction in the manner alleged here impliedly states that he has reason to believe the contents of the prospectus are accurate. If the underwriter knows, or is reckless in not knowing, that the statements contained within the prospectus are in fact false, the underwriter's implied statement is likewise false. An underwriter who makes such a statement has violated Rule 10b-5(b).</p>\n<p>The SEC in this case alleges that Tambone and Hussey made such statements to investors when they used the prospectuses containing false statements about timing practices to sell the Columbia Funds. They allegedly knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that those statements were false. These allegations were stated with sufficient particularity to meet the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), in conjunction with Rule 9(b).<sup>[28]</sup> Defendants' motions to dismiss the primary liability claims under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) should therefore have been denied.</p>\n<p>Hence, I would reverse the dismissal of the SEC's claims under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) and remand to the district court for further proceedings on those claims, as well as on the section 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting claims.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  An earlier action, filed in February of 2005, was dismissed without prejudice for failure to plead fraud with particularity. That action is of no moment here.</p>\n<p>[2]  This contention was based on the SEC's allegations that the defendants reviewed and commented on the market timing statements before those statements were included in the prospectuses. We do not quote these allegations at length, as the SEC has not pursued this line of argument on appeal.</p>\n<p>[3]  In addition, the SEC argued that Tambone had made material misrepresentations by signing selling agreements in which he vouched for the accuracy of the statements in the prospectuses. Because the SEC has not pursued this argument on appeal, we disregard it. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p>[4]  The panel parted ways only with respect to the Rule 10b-5(b) claims. <i>See </i><i>Tambone II,</i> 550 F.3d at 149 (Selya, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>[5]  That section provides in pertinent part:\n</p>\n<p>It shall be unlawful for any person . . ., directly or indirectly</p>\n<p>(1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, or</p>\n<p>(2) to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or</p>\n<p>(3) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.</p>\n<p>15 U.S.C. § 77q(a).</p>\n<p>[6]  The SEC has in fact brought a separate section 17(a)(2) claim against the defendants in this case. That claim is not before the en banc court.</p>\n<p>[7]  The SEC also endeavors to prop up its \"use\" theory of Rule 10b-5(b) liability by referring to a venerable Fourth Circuit case deciding, for venue purposes, whether a defendant violated a federal mortgage fraud statute in West Virginia or in Pennsylvania. <i>See </i><i>Reass v. United States,</i> 99 F.2d 752, 755 (4th Cir.1938).\n</p>\n<p>The only reason the opinion has even an epsilon's worth of relevance to the issue at hand is that the challenged statute rendered it unlawful to \"make[] any statement, knowing it to be false, for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of a Federal Home Loan Bank upon any application for loan.\" <i>Id.</i> at 752. But the <i>Reass</i> court did not presume to act as a legal lexicographer, chiseling in stone a definition of \"make\" for all time and for every purpose. The result in <i>Reass</i> proceeds from the simple proposition that the statute could not be violated until the defendant presented the misstatements to the bank \"upon. . . application for a loan.\" <i>Id.</i> at 755.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although the <i>Central Bank</i> Court focused its inquiry on section 10(b), its methodology is equally applicable to Rule 10b-5. The rule is incorporated into the statutory framework and, thus, its scope \"is coextensive with the coverage of § 10(b).\" <i>Zandford,</i> 535 U.S. at 816 n. 1, 122 S.Ct. 1899. Fidelity to the text of section 10(b) requires fidelity to the text of Rule 10b-5 and, therefore, fidelity to the text of each of the subsections that comprise the rule.</p>\n<p>[9]  For example, the bright-line test cannot be imported wholesale into the public enforcement context because its attribution prong reflects the need to prove reliance, <i>see </i><i>Wright,</i> 152 F.3d at 175an element that the SEC need not establish in a Rule 10b-5 case. <i>See </i><i>Schellenbach v. SEC,</i> 989 F.2d 907, 913 (7th Cir.1993); <i>see also </i><i>SEC v. Wolfson,</i> 539 F.3d 1249, 1260 (10th Cir.2008) (declining to impose the attribution requirement in an SEC enforcement action).</p>\n<p>[10]  Although the SEC at one time argued that the defendants \"made\" untrue statements of material fact through some vaguely described involvement in drafting the prospectuses, it has not pursued that argument on appeal.</p>\n<p>[11]  That section provides in pertinent part that: \"[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, . . . in connection with any tender offer.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78n(e).</p>\n<p>[12]  Under the shingle theory, a broker-dealer may be held liable under section 17(a) of the Securities Act or section 10(b) of the Exchange Act if he sells a security to a customer for a price unreasonably in excess of the current market price without disclosing the fact of the markup. <i>See </i><i>Grandon v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,</i> 147 F.3d 184, 192-93 (2d Cir. 1998); <i>Duker &amp; Duker,</i> 6 S.E.C. at 388-89. We have not been able to find any case in which the shingle theory has successfully been applied, under Rule 10b-5(b), to facts similar to the facts at hand.</p>\n<p>[13]  Oral or written statements made by underwriters while placing securities can be predicates for securities violations. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Dolphin &amp; Bradbury, Inc. v. SEC,</i> 512 F.3d 634, 638-40 (D.C.Cir.2008); <i>Sanders v. John Nuveen &amp; Co.,</i> 554 F.2d 790 (7th Cir.1977); <i>Picard Chem. Inc. Profit Sharing Plan v. Perrigo Co.,</i> 940 F.Supp. 1101, 1120-21 (W.D.Mich. 1996).</p>\n<p>[14]  Post <i>Central Bank,</i> this implied representation theory has been regularly rejected by the circuits, <i>see </i><i>Lattanzio v. Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP,</i> 476 F.3d 147, 155 (2d Cir.2007) (rejecting an \"implied assertion\" theory because \"[p]ublic understanding that an accountant is at work . . . does not create an exception to the requirement that an actionable misstatement be made by the accountant\"); <i>Fidel v. Farley,</i> 392 F.3d 220, 235 (6th Cir.2004); <i>Ziemba v. Cascade Int'l, Inc.,</i> 256 F.3d 1194, 1205-06 (11th Cir.2001); <i>Anixter v. Home-Stake Prod. Co.,</i> 77 F.3d 1215, 1226-27 (10th Cir. 1996), with the exception of the Ninth Circuit, <i>see </i><i>Howard v. Everex Sys., Inc.,</i> 228 F.3d 1057, 1061 n. 5 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>[15]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Dabit,</i> 547 U.S. 71, 86, 126 S.Ct. 1503, 164 L.Ed.2d 179 (2006); <i>Cent. Bank,</i> 511 U.S. at 189, 114 S.Ct. 1439; <i>Va. Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg,</i> 501 U.S. 1083, 1105, 111 S.Ct. 2749, 115 L.Ed.2d 929 (1991); <i>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores,</i> 421 U.S. 723, 739, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975).</p>\n<p>[16]  I join the majority's decision to reinstate the portions of the panel opinion addressing the SEC's section 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting claims and the portions of the panel judgment reversing those claims.</p>\n<p>[17]  Tambone and Hussey argue, inter alia, that the Commission's claims of primary liability should be rejected because of the SEC's own admission that Columbia Advisors, not defendants, \"remained primarily responsible for all representations made\" in the fund prospectuses. However, this quotation from <i>Central Bank</i> illustrates the Supreme Court's recognition that a securities fraud will likely involve multiple violators, thereby suggesting that individuals with different responsibilities could be primarily liable for the same misstatement. <i>See</i> 511 U.S. at 191, 114 S.Ct. 1439. Therefore, the primary liability of Columbia Advisors does not preclude the primary liability of Tambone and Hussey for their own use of the false and misleading statements contained in those prospectuses. The Supreme Court recently confirmed this principle in a private lawsuit by indicating that defendants Charter Communications, Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., and Motorola, Inc., had all engaged in the fraudulent conduct at issue. <i>See </i><i>Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,</i> 552 U.S. 148, 158-61, 128 S.Ct. 761, 169 L.Ed.2d 627 (2008). Although the Court's statement in <i>Central Bank</i> referred to Rule 10b-5(b), addressing material statements and omissions, and its comment in <i>Stoneridge</i> applied to 10b-5(a) or (c), addressing other types of deceptive conduct, the scope of primary liability in each subsection is governed by the language of section 10(b) of the Exchange Act. Therefore, the Supreme Court's recent confirmation that multiple individuals may be primarily liable under Rule 10b-5(a) or (c) is applicable to its interpretation of Rule 10b-5(b).</p>\n<p>[18]  <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. O'Hagan,</i> 521 U.S. 642, 664, 117 S.Ct. 2199, 138 L.Ed.2d 724 (1997) (noting that <i>Central Bank</i> \"concerned only private civil litigation under § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, not criminal liability[,]\" and therefore that its \"reference to purchasers or sellers of securities must be read in light of a longstanding limitation on private § 10(b) suits\").</p>\n<p>[19]  The Rule states:\n</p>\n<p>It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly . . .</p>\n<p>(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,</p>\n<p>(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or</p>\n<p>(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.</p>\n<p>17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.</p>\n<p>[20]  Although deceptive conduct in the sale of securities could trigger liability under section 17(a), that provision does not cover purchases and therefore would not always offer an alternative vehicle for SEC enforcement.</p>\n<p>[21]  Section 11 of the Securities Act \"prohibits false statements or omissions of material fact in registration statements\" and \"identifies the various categories of defendants subject to liability for a violation,\" including underwriters. <i>Central Bank,</i> 511 U.S. at 179, 114 S.Ct. 1439; <i>see also</i> 15 U.S.C. § 77k(a)(5).</p>\n<p>[22]  Section 12 \"prohibits the sale of unregistered, nonexempt securities as well as the sale of securities by means of a material misstatement or omission; and it limits liability to those who offer or sell the security.\" <i>Central Bank,</i> 511 U.S. at 179, 114 S.Ct. 1439; <i>see also</i> 15 U.S.C. § 77l(a).</p>\n<p>[23]  The SEC specifically observes in this Release that the underwriters' \"obligation to have a reasonable basis for belief in the accuracy of statements directly made concerning the offering is underscored when a broker-dealer underwrites securities.\" <i>Id.</i> at *21.</p>\n<p>[24]  The judgment in <i>Sanders</i> was vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</i> 425 U.S. 185, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976), which held that scienter is an element of a private cause of action under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <i>See </i><i>John Nuveen &amp; Co. v. Sanders,</i> 425 U.S. 929, 96 S.Ct. 1659, 48 L.Ed.2d 172 (1976); <i>Hochfelder,</i> 425 U.S. at 193, 96 S.Ct. 1375. The Seventh Circuit on remand held that liability could no longer rest on Rule 10b-5 because the defendant's conduct had been \"mistaken but honest in belief.\" 554 F.2d at 792. As the majority points out, when the Seventh Circuit subsequently re-heard the case, it referred to explicit statements made by the defendant underwriter. <i>See</i> 619 F.2d 1222, 1224 (7th Cir. 1980). In its earlier ruling, however, the court had noted that \"the evidence does not indicate that all members of the class relied on express recommendations,\" 524 F.2d at 1069, and it therefore based liability on the underwriter's implied statements.</p>\n<p>[25]  Section 14(e) provides, in relevant part: \"It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, . . . in connection with any tender offer.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78n(e). That language is in pertinent respects identical to the language in Rule 10b-5(b) that is at issue here.</p>\n<p>[26]  <i>See </i><i>Lattanzio v. Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP,</i> 476 F.3d 147, 155 (2d Cir.2007) (accountant); <i>Fidel v. Farley,</i> 392 F.3d 220, 235 (6th Cir.2004) (auditor), <i>overruled on other grounds by </i><i>Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd.,</i> 551 U.S. 308, 324, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 168 L.Ed.2d 179 (2007); <i>Ziemba v.

Co.,</i> 77 F.3d 1215, 1226-27 (10th Cir. 1996) (accountant).</p>\n<p>[27]  The majority quotes <i>Fortson v. Winstead, McGuire, Sechrest &amp; Minick,</i> 961 F.2d 469 (4th Cir. 1992), for the proposition that \"`the duty to disclose material facts arises only when there is some basis outside the securities laws, such as state law, for finding a fiduciary or other confidential relationship.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 472. Several circuits have adopted the proposition that federal securities law cannot establish the requisite duty. <i>Id.</i> That exclusion would be inappropriate for underwriters, whose unique duty to investors is deeply embedded in federal law independent of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <i>See supra</i> Section B.2.</p>\n<p>[28]  The allegations in the SEC's complaint are described in detail in the panel decision, <i>SEC v. Tambone,</i> 550 F.3d 106, 141-143 (1st Cir. 2008), and need not be repeated here. It suffices to say that the SEC meticulously identified the alleged misrepresentations, the defendants' roles in overseeing the distribution of fund prospectuses in connection with the sale of Columbia Funds, and the basis for their knowledge or recklessness in not knowing that prohibited market timing arrangements existed (rendering the prospectus statements false).</p>\n\n</div>",

The issue before us is one of first impression. It turns on the meaning of the word \"make\" as used in Rule 10b-5(b). The SEC advocates an expansive definition, contending that one may \"make\" a statement within the purview of the rule by merely using or disseminating a statement without regard to the authorship of that statement or, in the alternative, that securities professionals who direct the offering and sale of shares on behalf of an underwriter impliedly \"make\" a statement, covered by the rule, to the effect that the disclosures in a prospectus are truthful and complete.</p>\n<p>We reject the SEC's expansive interpretation. It is inconsistent with the text of the rule and with the ordinary meanings of the phrase \"to make a statement,\" inconsistent with the structure of the rule and relevant statutes, and in considerable tension with Supreme Court precedent. Consequently, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the SEC's Rule 10b-5(b) claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Because this appeal follows the district court's granting of a motion to dismiss, we rehearse the facts as well-pleaded in the SEC's complaint. <i>See </i><i>Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201545\"><a href=\"/opinion/201545/centro-medico-del-v-feliciano-de-melecio/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>At all times material hereto (roughly, 1998-2003), the defendants, James Tambone and Robert Hussey, were senior executives of a registered broker-dealer, Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc. (Columbia Distributor), or its predecessor in interest. Columbia Distributor underwrites and markets mutual funds. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated sundry provisions of both the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Exchange Act. Its complaint depicts a tangled web of interlocking entities. We briefly trace the fibers within that web.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*439</span> During the relevant period, Columbia Distributor was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbia Management Group, Inc. (Columbia Management) and an indirect subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corporation (Fleet). Columbia Distributor was known as Liberty Funds Distributor, Inc. (Liberty Distributor) until 2001, when Fleet purchased its parent corporation, Liberty Financial Group (Liberty).</p>\n<p>Columbia Distributor acted as the principal underwriter and distributor of over 140 mutual funds in the Columbia mutual fund complex (the Columbia Funds). The Columbia Funds included several funds that had been owned by Liberty prior to the take-over by Fleet. In its wonted role, Columbia Distributor sold shares in the Columbia Funds and disseminated their prospectuses to investors.</p>\n<p>Direct responsibility for the representations contained in the prospectuses rested with the funds' sponsor, Columbia Management Advisors, Inc., and its predecessors in interest (collectively, Columbia Advisors). Like Columbia Distributor, Columbia Advisors was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbia Management and, thus, an indirect subsidiary of Fleet for much of the relevant period.</p>\n<p>The defendants held positions of trust and responsibility in this corporate pyramid. Tambone served as co-president of Columbia Distributor from 2001 to 2004. Prior thereto, he held the same post with Liberty Distributor. Hussey served as managing director (national accounts) of Columbia Distributor from 2002 until 2004. Before that, he occupied a comparable position with Liberty Distributor. The SEC does not allege that either defendant worked for the Columbia Funds' sponsor, Columbia Advisors, during the relevant time frame.</p>\n<p>The short-term trading practice that lies at the epicenter of this case is known in the trade as \"market timing.\" Market timing is the practice of frequent buying and selling of shares of a single mutual fund in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing. According to the SEC, market timing, though not illegal per se, can harm other fund investors and, therefore, is commonly barred (or at least restricted) by those in charge of mutual funds.</p>\n<p>The Columbia Funds' prospectuses contained representations touching upon the subject of market timing. Starting at least as early as 1998, language was inserted into many Columbia Funds' prospectuses restricting the number and frequency of round-trips (<i>i.e.,</i> exchanges from one fund to another and back again) in which an investor could indulge. Emblematic of this prophylaxis was language, first appearing in May of 1999, inserted in prospectuses for funds belonging to the Acorn Fund Group, a constituent of the Columbia Funds. That language stated that the funds within the group \"do not permit market-timing and have adopted policies to discourage this practice.\"</p>\n<p>This effort to curb market timing escalated over time. In 2000, Hussey co-chaired an internet working group formed to create procedures designed to detect and deter market timing in the Columbia Funds. The working group ultimately recommended that each of the member funds take a consistent position against market timing in future prospectuses. As a result, a number of funds began to include a \"strict prohibition\" in every prospectus, expressly barring short-term or excessive trading. By 2003, the strict prohibition language, or a variant of it, appeared in all the Columbia Funds' prospectuses.</p>\n<p>The SEC alleges that, despite the language in the prospectuses expressing hostility toward market timingthe existence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*440</span> of which Tambone and Hussey allegedly either knew or recklessly ignoredthe defendants jointly and severally entered into, approved, and/or knowingly permitted arrangements allowing certain preferred customers to engage in market timing forays in at least sixteen different Columbia Funds during the relevant period. The SEC also alleges that the defendants used the prospectuses in their sales efforts by allowing them to be disseminated and referring potential clients to them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</h2>\n<p>On May 19, 2006, the SEC filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.<sup>[1]</sup> In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Tambone and Hussey had violated section 17(a) of the Securities Act, section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the SEC alleged that the defendants had aided and abetted primary violations of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by Columbia Advisors and Columbia Distributor, primary violations of section 15(c) of the Exchange Act by Columbia Distributor, and primary violations of section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. § 80b-6, by Columbia Advisors.</p>\n<p>In due season, each defendant moved to dismiss. The SEC opposed the motions. As the parties' arguments with respect to liability under Rule 10b-5(b) are central to this appeal, we summarize them succinctly.</p>\n<p>The defendants premised their challenge on the thesis that the SEC had failed properly to plead any actionable misstatements on their part. In opposition, the SEC countered that the complaint sufficiently alleged that the defendants had made material misrepresentations regarding market timing in the Columbia Funds' prospectuses. Specifically, the SEC argued that the defendants \"made\" false statements of material facts within the meaning of Rule 10b-5(b) by (i) participating in the drafting process that went into the development of the market timing language,<sup>[2]</sup> and (ii) using the prospectuses in their sales efforts, allowing the prospectuses to be disseminated and referring clients to them for information.<sup>[3]</sup> Finally, the SEC argued that the defendants were liable for a material omission under Rule 10b-5(b).</p>\n<p>The district court granted the motions to dismiss. <i>SEC v. Tambone</i> (<i>Tambone I</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2327963\"><a href=\"/opinion/2327963/sec-v-tambone/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 168 (D.Mass.2006). With respect to the Rule 10b-5(b) claim premised on the defendants' making of false statements, the court applied the bright-line test articulated in <i>Wright v. Ernst &amp; Young LLP,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757027\"><a href=\"/opinion/757027/fed-sec-l-rep-p-90266-irene-l-wright-on-behalf-of-herself-and-all/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span>, 175 (2d Cir.1998), and held that the SEC's allegations about the defendants' participation in the drafting process and their subsequent use of the prospectuses were too conclusory and attenuated to satisfy the particularity requirement of Federal Rule of Civil <span class=\"star-pagination\">*441</span> Procedure 9(b). <i>Tambone I,</i> 473 F.Supp.2d at 166. The court found unconvincing the SEC's other arguments for liability under Rule 10b-5. <i>Id.</i> at 167. The court likewise rejected the SEC's section 17(a) and aiding and abetting claims. <i>Id.</i> at 167-68.</p>\n<p>The SEC appealed from the granting of the motions to dismiss with respect to its section 17(a)(2), Rule 10b-5(b), and aiding and abetting claims.</p>\n<p>With respect to Rule 10b-5(b), the SEC briefed two arguments as to how the defendants \"made\" the alleged misrepresentations. First, the SEC argued that the defendants \"made\" the misrepresentations by using the prospectuses to sell the mutual funds. Second, the SEC argued that the defendants impliedly made false representations to investors to the effect that they had a reasonable basis for believing that the key representations in the prospectuses were truthful and complete. This implied statement theory rested on the premise that a securities professional engaged in the offering of securities has a \"special duty\" to undertake an investigation that would provide him with a reasonable basis for believing that the representations in the prospectus are truthful and complete. Therefore, the theory goes, a securities professional \"makes\" an implied representation to investors that the prospectus is truthful and complete when he engages in an offering.</p>\n<p>What the SEC chose not to argue is also noteworthy. The SEC did not allude to its argument, which at one point had been raised below, that the defendants made the alleged misstatements through their involvement with the preparation of the prospectuses. Similarly, although the SEC had pleaded violations of subparagraphs (a) and (c) of Rule 10b-5, it did not pursue those claims on appeal. In accordance with our usual praxis, we deem abandoned all arguments that have not been briefed and developed on appeal. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Tambone</i> (<i>Tambone II</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203578\"><a href=\"/opinion/203578/sec-v-tambone/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 149 (1st Cir.2008) (withdrawn).<sup>[4]</sup> With respect to Rule 10b-5(b), the panel majority adopted the SEC's implied representation theory and held that the SEC had thereby alleged that the defendants had made false statements. <i>Id.</i> at 135.</p>\n<p>The defendants filed petitions for en banc review, Fed. R.App. P. 35, challenging all of the panel's holdings. The full court withdrew the panel opinion but ordered rehearing en banc only on the Rule 10b-5(b) issues. <i>SEC v. Tambone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203921\"><a href=\"/opinion/203921/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-tambone/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.2009) (order granting rehearing en banc). The court declined to rehear the parties' arguments concerning either the section 17(a)(2) or the aiding and abetting rulings. <i>Id.</i> Following a new round of briefing (including helpful submissions by an array of amici) and reargument, we took the matter under advisement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's disposition of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <i>Centro Medico del Turabo,</i> 406 F.3d at 5.

In other words, the complaint must include \"factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" <i>Id.</i> If the factual allegations in the complaint are too meager, vague, or conclusory to remove the possibility of relief from the realm of mere conjecture, the complaint is open to dismissal. <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 555, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>This case presents the two-part question of whether a securities professional can be said to \"make\" a statement, such that liability under Rule 10b-5(b) may attach, either by (i) using statements to sell securities, regardless of whether those statements were crafted entirely by others, or (ii) directing the offering and sale of securities on behalf of an underwriter, thus making an implied statement that he has a reasonable basis to believe that the key representations in the relevant prospectus are truthful and complete. The answer to each part of this two-part question is \"no.\"</p>\n<p>We think it appropriate to commence our analysis with the text of the relevant statute and rule. <i>See </i><i>Cent. Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117837\"><a href=\"/opinion/117837/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-of-denver-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 173, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117837\"><a href=\"/opinion/117837/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-of-denver-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span> (1994). Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act renders it unlawful for a person \"[t]o use or employ . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b). Pursuant to its rulemaking authority under section 10(b), the SEC adopted Rule 10b-5(b), which provides, in pertinent part, that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, . . . [t]o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.\" 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b). The inquiry here centers on whether the defendants made untrue statements of material fact within the meaning of this rule.</p>\n<p>In conducting this inquiry, the pivotal word in the rule's text is \"make,\" as in \"to make a statement.\" The rule itself does not define that word, nor does it suggest that the word is imbued with any exotic meaning. In the absence of either a built-in definition or some reliable indicium that the drafters intended a special nuance, accepted canons of construction teach that the word should be given its ordinary meaning. <i>See </i><i>Smith v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112866\"><a href=\"/opinion/112866/smith-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 228, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112866\"><a href=\"/opinion/112866/smith-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span> (1977) (interpreting Rule 10b-5 according to the \"commonly accepted meaning\" of its words); <i>In re Hill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203756\"><a href=\"/opinion/203756/in-re-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2009) (noting that, in general, words in a statute carry their ordinary meanings if not specially defined).</p>\n<p>One reference point for determining the ordinary meaning of a word is its accepted dictionary definition. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Smith,</i> 508 U.S. at 228-29, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112866\"><a href=\"/opinion/112866/smith-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2050</span></a></span> (consulting various dictionaries to discern the plain meaning of the word \"use\" in the relevant statute). For purposes of this analysis, we refer to several common and representative dictionary definitions of \"make,\" which include \"create [or] cause,\" Webster's Third New Int'l Dict. 1363 (2002); \"compose,\" <i>id.;</i> and \"cause (something) to exist,\" Black's Law Dict. 1041 (9th ed.2009).</p>\n<p>This case does not require us to set forth a comprehensive test for determining when a speaker may be said to have made a statement. It is enough to say that the SEC's purported reading of the word is inconsistent with each of these definitions. In any event, the question does not turn on dictionary meanings alone. We also look to the structure of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, as well as other, related provisions, to interpret the term at issue. Chief among these structural considerations is the relationship between section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b). Section 10(b) grants the SEC broad authority to proscribe conduct that \"use[s] or employ[s]\" any \"manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance,\" in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b).</p>\n<p>In Rule 10b-5(b), the SEC prohibited a specific subset of all \"manipulative or deceptive device[s] or contrivance[s],\" namely, untrue or misleading statements of material fact. It likewise prohibited a specific subset of all conduct that might be said to \"use or employ\" such a manipulative device or contrivance: the making of untrue or misleading statements of material fact.</p>\n<p>In light of this deliberate word choice (\"make\"), the SEC's asseveration that one can \"make\" a statement when he merely uses a statement created entirely by others cannot follow. That asseveration ignores the obvious distinction between the verbs contained in the statute (\"use,\" \"employ\") and the significantly different (and narrower) verb contained in Rule 10b-5(b) (\"make\"). Word choices have consequences, and this word choice virtually leaps off the page. There is no principled way that we can treat it as meaningless.</p>\n<p>Section 10(b) is helpful to our analysis in another way as well. That provision conferred upon the SEC authority to prohibit the \"use or employ[ment]\" of any manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. The SEC knew how to wield this authority and proscribe \"use or employ[ment]\" of a manipulative device or contrivance: in Rule 10b-5(a), it did just that, rendering it unlawful \"to employ\" a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud. <i>See</i> 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(a). That the SEC wrote this prohibition in a <i>different</i> subparagraph of the rule and selected a more inclusive verb is a telling combination. The Supreme Court remarked on this phenomenon in <i>Affiliated Ute v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108526\"><a href=\"/opinion/108526/affiliated-ute-citizens-of-utah-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108526\"><a href=\"/opinion/108526/affiliated-ute-citizens-of-utah-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span> (1972), observing that:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he second subparagraph of the rule specifies the making of an untrue statement of a material fact and the omission to state a material fact. The first and third subparagraphs are not so restricted.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*444</span> <i>Id.</i> at 152-53, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108526\"><a href=\"/opinion/108526/affiliated-ute-citizens-of-utah-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1456</span></a></span>. It is not the judiciary's proper province to rewrite an administrative rule to sweep more broadly than its language permits. Thus, we must honor the limitation that the drafters deliberately built into Rule 10b-5(b).</p>\n<p>In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the SEC suggests that the broad language of the statute (\"use or employ\") requires an equally broad construction of the wording contained in Rule 10b-5(b). To support this suggestion, it touts the Supreme Court's statement that \"[t]he scope of Rule 10b-5 is coextensive with the coverage of § 10(b).\" <i>SEC v. Zandford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118513\"><a href=\"/opinion/118513/sec-v-zandford/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span>, 816 n. 1, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118513\"><a href=\"/opinion/118513/sec-v-zandford/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (2002). On that basis, the SEC posits that \"make\" must include \"use\" because the statute prohibits \"use\" and the rule perforce must prohibit all that the statute prohibits.</p>\n<p>This argument comprises more cry than wool. Most notably, it fails to account for an abecedarian point: even if Rule 10b-5 is coextensive with the coverage of section 10(b), that supposed verity does not mean that each of the subparagraphs of Rule 10b-5, taken singly, is itself coextensive with the coverage of section 10(b). That cannot be so. If it was, then each subparagraph would proscribe exactly the same conduct. They do not. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Finkel v. Docutel/Olivetti Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487439\"><a href=\"/opinion/487439/hannah-finkel-v-docutelolivetti-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">817</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, 359-60 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>Our view of the meaning of Rule 10b-5(b) is reinforced when we contrast the language of the rule with that of section 17(a) of the Securities Act. By way of background, the phrasing of Rule 10b-5 largely mirrors the language of section 17(a) of the Securities Act.<sup>[5]</sup> That is not happenstance; the drafters of Rule 10b-5 modeled the rule on section 17(a). <i>See </i><i>United States v. Persky,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"329232\"><a href=\"/opinion/329232/fed-sec-l-rep-p-95209-united-states-of-america-v-robert-s-persky/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></a></span>, 287 (2d Cir.1975). But there is a salient difference between the language of the rule and the language of section 17(a) with respect to the types of conduct that may render a person liable for a false statement. Section 17(a)(2) makes it unlawful \"to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact,\" 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2), whereas Rule 10b-5(b) makes it unlawful \"to make any untrue statement of a material fact,\" 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b).</p>\n<p>In short, the drafters of Rule 10b-5 had before them language that would have covered the \"use\" of an untrue statement of material fact (regardless of who created or composed the statement). The drafters easily could have copied that language. They declined to do so. Instead, the drafters who faithfully tracked section 17(a) in other respectsdeliberately eschewed the expansive language of section 17(a)(2).</p>\n<p>The import of this eschewal is clear: although section 17(a)(2) may fairly be read to cover the \"use\" of an untrue statement to obtain money or property, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Edward J.

One of the SEC's main arguments appears to be that \"[i]t seems self-evident that any statute or rule that prohibits making a false statement in connection with the sale of property would cover a seller who knowingly uses misleading sales materials.\" This type of abstract, decontextualized approach to the interpretation of a statute or regulation is ill-suited to the construction of a rule laden with over sixty years of interpretation in literally hundreds of opinions. This is especially so because the rule in question is an integral part of an extensive regulatory framework forged by Congress, the SEC, and the federal courts.</p>\n<p>At any rate, what the SEC now calls \"self-evident\" is not self-evident at all. What does seem self-evident is that if the SEC intended to prohibit more than just the actual making of a false statement in Rule 10b-5(b), then it would not have employed the solitary verb \"make\" in the text of the rule.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>There is another reason to reject the SEC's interpretation; it is in tension with Supreme Court precedent. Under modern Supreme Court precedent dealing with Rule 10b-5, much turns on the distinction between primary and secondary violators. <i>See </i><i>Cent. Bank,</i> 511 U.S. at 191, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117837\"><a href=\"/opinion/117837/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-of-denver-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although <i>Central Bank</i> did not address the precise issue with which we are concerned, the definition of \"make\" that we propose is compatible with <i>Central Bank</i> as it holds the line between primary and secondary liability in a manner faithful to <i>Central Bank.</i> We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>The Exchange Act does not explicitly confer a private right of action for section 10(b) violations. The Supreme Court nevertheless has found a private right of action to be implicit in the statute and the implementing rule (Rule 10b-5). <i>Sup't of Ins. of N.Y. v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108391\"><a href=\"/opinion/108391/supt-of-insurance-v-bankers-life-cas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 13 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108391\"><a href=\"/opinion/108391/supt-of-insurance-v-bankers-life-cas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span> (1971). This right of action is not unbridled: private plaintiffs are permitted to bring suit under Rule 10b-5 against only \"primary\" violators. <i>See </i><i>Cent. Bank,</i> 511 U.S. at 177-78, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117837\"><a href=\"/opinion/117837/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-of-denver-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1439</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>In the wake of <i>Central Bank,</i> Congress amended section 20 of the Exchange Act to clarify that the SEC may bring suit against aiders and abetters, that is, persons who knowingly provide substantial assistance to primary violators of the securities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*446</span> laws. Pub.L. 104-67, § 104, 109 Stat. 737, 757 (1995) (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78t(e)). Although the SEC has exhorted Congress to extend the same right to private parties, <i>see</i> 4 Thomas Lee Hazen, The Law of Securities Regulation 506 n. 31 (6th ed.2009), Congress has not done so. Thus, Rule 10b-5's private right of action extends only to primary violations, not to secondary violations. If <i>Central Bank's</i> carefully drawn circumscription of the private right of action is not to be hollowed and we do not think that it should be courts must be vigilant to ensure that secondary violations are not shoehorned into the category reserved for primary violations.</p>\n<p>The SEC's position poses a threat to the integrity of this dichotomy. Refined to bare essence, the SEC, through the instrumentality of Rule 10b-5(b), seeks to impose primary liability on the defendants for conduct that constitutes, at most, aiding and abetting (a secondary violation). Allowing the SEC to blur the line between primary and secondary violations in this manner would be unfaithful to the taxonomy of <i>Central Bank.</i></p>\n<p>Of course, the <i>Central Bank</i> Court did not purpose to decide the precise issue before us. Withal, the Court's methodology for determining the scope of the private right of action (and, thus, the scope of primary liability) is a beacon by which we must steer. That methodology emphasizes fidelity to the text of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <i>See </i><i>Cent. Bank,</i> 511 U.S. at 173, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117837\"><a href=\"/opinion/117837/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-of-denver-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Allowing courts to imply that \"X\" has made a false statement with only a factual allegation that he passed along what someone else wrote would flout a core principle that underpins the <i>Central Bank</i> decision. We decline the SEC's invitation to go down that road.</p>\n<p>As an aside, blurring the line between primary and secondary violations also would create unacceptable tension with the substantial body of case law that has evolved post-<i>Central Bank</i>case law that maps the outer boundaries of primary liability under Rule 10b-5. This case law, though not directly on point, does not fit comfortably with the view that the SEC espouses here. Let us explain.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*447</span> In the aftermath of <i>Central Bank,</i> several courts of appeals have had to plot the line between primary violations and mere aiding and abetting in Rule 10b-5 actions brought by private plaintiffs. Two divergent strains of authority have evolved. We have not yet chosen between these divergent strains and we have no need to do so today. It suffices to say that the line of authority most hospitable to the establishment of primary violations of Rule 10b-5 embraces the \"substantial participation\" test, under which a person's \"substantial participation or intricate involvement in the preparation of fraudulent statements\" is enough to establish a primary violation. <i>Howard v. Everex Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770687\"><a href=\"/opinion/770687/joan-c-howard-v-everex-systems-inc-steven-lw-hui-michael-cy-wong/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1057</span></a></span>, 1061 n. 5 (9th Cir.2000). The other line of authority, less hospitable to plaintiffs, adheres to the \"bright-line\" test, under which a primary violation requires proof both that the defendant actually made a false or misleading statement and that it was attributable to him at the time of public dissemination. <i>See </i><i>Wright,</i> 152 F.3d at 175; <i>see also </i><i>Ziemba v. Cascade Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></span>, 1205 (11th Cir. 2001); <i>Anixter v. Home-Stake Prod. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714096\"><a href=\"/opinion/714096/ivan-a-anixter-blanche-dickenson-dolly-k-yoshida-on-behalf-of-themselves/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span>, 1226 (10th Cir.1996); <i>In re Kendall Sq.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 28 n. 2 (D.Mass.1994).</p>\n<p>While these tests are designed for private litigation, and, thus, are poorly suited to public enforcement actions,<sup>[9]</sup> one thing is crystal clear. The conduct for which the SEC strives to hold the defendants as primary violatorsthe use and dissemination of prospectuses created by others does not satisfy either test. Both tests focus, albeit to different degrees, on the actual role that a defendant played in creating, composing, or causing the existence of an untrue statement of material fact. The SEC's attempt to impute statements to persons who may not have had any role in their creation, composition, or preparation falls well short.<sup>[10]</sup> As the Second Circuit put it: \"If <i>Central Bank</i> is to have any real meaning, a defendant must actually make a false or misleading statement in order to be held liable [as a primary violator] under section 10(b). Anything short of such conduct is merely aiding and abetting.\" <i>Shapiro v. Cantor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745384\"><a href=\"/opinion/745384/fed-sec-l-rep-p-99522-sidney-shapiro-carol-e-acker-robert-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span>, 720 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>There is yet another problem with the SEC's implied statement theory: that theory effectively imposes upon securities professionals who work for underwriters an unprecedented duty. We elaborate on this mischief below.</p>\n<p>The SEC notes, correctly, that securities professionals working for underwriters have a duty to investigate the nature and circumstances of an offering. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>SEC v. Dain Rauscher, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773768\"><a href=\"/opinion/773768/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-dain-rauscher-inc-kenneth-d-ough/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span>, 857 (9th Cir.2001). Building on this foundation, the SEC theorizes that such securities professionals impliedly \"make\" a representation to investors that the statements in a prospectus are truthful and complete. If we were to give credence to this theory, the upshot would be to impose primary liability under Rule 10b-5(b) on these securities professionals whenever they fail to disclose material information <span class=\"star-pagination\">*448</span> not included in a prospectus, regardless of who prepared the prospectus. That would be tantamount to imposing a free-standing and unconditional duty to disclose. The imposition of such a duty flies in the teeth of Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p>The key precedent is <i>Chiarella v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110221\"><a href=\"/opinion/110221/chiarella-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110221\"><a href=\"/opinion/110221/chiarella-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span> (1980). It instructs that a party's nondisclosure of information to another is actionable under Rule 10b-5 only when there is an <i>independent</i> duty to disclose the information arising from \"a fiduciary or other similar relation of trust and confidence\" between the parties. <i>Id.</i> at 228, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110221\"><a href=\"/opinion/110221/chiarella-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></a></span>. As the Fourth Circuit explained, \"the duty to disclose material facts arises only when there is some basis outside the securities laws, such as state law, for finding a fiduciary or other confidential relationship.\" <i>Fortson v. Winstead, McGuire, Sechrest &amp; Minick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581386\"><a href=\"/opinion/581386/kent-d-fortson-kermit-r-ary-jr-donald-g-bell-jr-eugene-h-boyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, 472 (4th Cir.1992); <i>accord </i><i>SEC v.

Adopting the SEC's implied statement theory would pave the way for suits against securities professionals for nondisclosure of material information without the required showing of a fiduciary relationship. Fidelity to that requirement demands that we reject the SEC's notion that a breach of a duty to investigate, without more, is a breach of a duty to disclose (and, thus, should be treated as a primary violation under Rule 10b-5(b)).</p>\n<p>The SEC labors to depict its implied statement theory as firmly rooted in both case law and longstanding administrative interpretation. This depiction is inaccurate.</p>\n<p>As to case law, the SEC relies principally on three decisions. <i>See </i><i>Dolphin &amp; Bradbury, Inc. v. SEC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187071\"><a href=\"/opinion/187071/bradbury-v-sec/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">634</span></a></span>, 641 (D.C.Cir.2008); <i>Sanders v. John Nuveen &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"330781\"><a href=\"/opinion/330781/fed-sec-l-rep-p-95347-henry-t-sanders-v-john-nuveen-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1064</span></a></span>, 1070 (7th Cir.1975); <i>Chris-Craft Indus., Inc. v.

These decisions, it asserts, stand for the linchpin proposition that an underwriter participating in an offering makes an implied statement, potentially actionable under Rule 10b-5(b), that he has a reasonable basis for believing that the prospectus is truthful and complete.</p>\n<p>That assertion is incorrect. To begin, neither <i>Dolphin</i> nor <i>Sanders</i> holds that an underwriter may be found liable as a primary violator under Rule 10b-5(b) for \"making\" an implied representation that proves to be false. Those cases did not present any issue as to whether the underwriter had \"made\" a statement. In fact, in both cases the underwriter personally made the misrepresentations. <i>See </i><i>Dolphin,</i> 512 F.3d at 638, 640; <i>Sanders,</i> 524 F.2d at 1067; <i>see also </i><i>Sanders v. John Nuveen &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377141\"><a href=\"/opinion/377141/fed-sec-l-rep-p-97372-henry-t-sanders-v-john-nuveen-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">619</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1222</span></a></span>, 1224 (7th Cir.1980). Both decisions were directed toward a wholly distinct issue: whether the defendant acted with the required state of mind in making the statements. <i>See </i><i>Dolphin,</i> 512 F.3d at 639; <i>Sanders,</i> 524 F.2d at 1066. Any language suggesting that various representations might be imputed to underwriters must be viewed in this (very different) context.</p>\n<p><i>Chris-Craft</i> also fails to breathe life into the SEC's argument. The case holds that an underwriter's constructive representation that the statements made in registration materials are truthful and complete constitutes the making of a statement under section 14(e) of the Exchange Act.<sup>[11]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*449</span> <i>See </i><i>Chris-Craft,</i> 480 F.2d at 370. But <i>Chris-Craft</i> preceded <i>Central Bank</i> by over twenty years, and its continued vitality with respect to this section 14(e) holding is doubtful.</p>\n<p>In all events, nothing turned on the distinction between primary and secondary violations at that time, so the <i>Chris-Craft</i> panel had no reason to distinguish between them. In retrospect, it is reasonable to read <i>Chris-Craft</i> as holding that the underwriters were liable only as secondary violators. <i>See </i><i>In re MTC Elec. Techs. S'holder Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2285905\"><a href=\"/opinion/2285905/in-re-mtc-electronic-technologies-shareholder-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We freely accept the principle that the existence of a longstanding pattern of administrative interpretation might well call for <i>Chevron</i> deference. <i>See </i><i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 843-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1984). Here, however, the SEC's claim of a \"longstanding administrative interpretation\" is wildly exaggerated.</p>\n<p>The SEC has cobbled together a bricolage of agency decisions and statements all of which antedate <i>Central Bank.</i> Without exception, nothing in this carefully culled collection says that an implied representation of an underwriter can constitute a basis for primary liability under Rule 10b-5(b). The fact that the SEC has never before articulated the implied statement theory as a basis for Rule 10b-5(b) liability dooms its quest for <i>Chevron</i> deference. After all, there is no occasion for <i>Chevron</i> deference when there is nothing to which a court may defer.</p>\n<p>Before leaving this topic, we wish to comment briefly on the dissent's metronomic reliance on the special role and duties of underwriters. We agree that underwriters have a special niche in the marketing of securities and, thus, have a special set of responsibilities. But the duty that the dissent seeks to impose is unprecedentedand far exceeds the scope of Rule 10b-5(b). While that rule could have been drafted to cut a wider swath, it was not. The SEC has other, more appropriate tools that it may use to police the parade of horribilis that the dissent envisions, and it is neither necessary nor wise to attempt to expand the rule by judicial fiat. Most importantly, doing so would, as a matter of law, be wrong.</p>\n<p>There is one loose end, which relates to waiver. The SEC argues to the en banc court that the defendants can be held primarily liable for violating Rule 10b-5(b) under an entanglement test. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Cabletron Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></span>, 37-38 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Elkind v. Liggett &amp; Myers, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384555\"><a href=\"/opinion/384555/fed-sec-l-rep-p-97716-arnold-b-elkind/\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>, 163 (2d Cir.1980). Under this test, a defendant may be held primarily liable for misstatements appearing in reports authored by outside analysts when those misrepresentations are based on information provided by the defendant. <i>See </i><i>Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 38. Such liability inheres when \"defendants have expressly or impliedly adopted the statements, placed their imprimatur on the statements, or have otherwise entangled themselves with the analysts to a significant degree.\" <i>Id.</i> at 37-38.</p>\n<p>This argument has not been preserved and, thus, need not concern us. The SEC did not advance it before the district court in connection with the dispositive motions to dismiss. To make a bad situation worse, the SEC did not coherently present this argument before the panel during the first stage of this appeal. To the contrary, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*450</span> the SEC's panel briefs were devoid not only of any developed argumentation to the effect that the defendants entangled themselves with the statements in the prospectuses but also of citations to <i>Cabletron, Elkind,</i> or any comparable precedent. In this instance, silence speak volumes.</p>\n<p>A party cannot switch horses mid-stream, changing its theory of liability at a later stage of the litigation in hopes of securing a swifter steed. So it is here: because the SEC unfurled its \"entanglement\" argument for the first time in the en banc proceedings, we have no occasion to address that argument. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Slade,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595481\"><a href=\"/opinion/595481/united-states-v-frances-slade/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\"); <i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17 (explaining that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\").</p>\n<p>This is not the only waiver that has transpired. The SEC unveiled for the first time in its reply brief regarding rehearing en banc a contention that its implied statement theory of Rule 10b-5(b) liability could be upheld under the so-called shingle theory. <i>See, e.g., Duker &amp; Duker,</i> 6 S.E.C. 386, 388-89, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">36426</span></span> (1939).<sup>[12]</sup> This belated contention is likewise waived.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. This is one of those happy occasions when the language and structure of a rule, the statutory framework that it implements, and the teachings of the Supreme Court coalesce to provide a well-lit decisional path. Following that path, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the SEC's Rule 10b-5(b) claim. Because en banc review is limited to this claim, we reinstate those portions of the vacated panel judgment that reversed the dismissal of the SEC's section 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting claims. To that end, we also reinstate those portions of the withdrawn panel opinion, and concurrence thereto, addressing those claims (which, when reinstated, will have the force ordinarily associated with panel opinions). We remand the case to the district court for further proceedings on the SEC's section 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting claims consistent, of course, with this en banc opinion.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge, with whom LYNCH, Chief Judge, joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>A \"plain language\" approach to statutory construction has well-known adherents, andin construing the SEC's rule at issue (\"make any untrue statement of a material fact\")bare wording forcefully supports Judge Selya's thorough and persuasive decision. Yet even a more elastic \"all things considered\" reading of the rule's language would not justify the alarmingly ambitious use of it that the agency seeks to deploy in this case.</p>\n<p>The word \"make,\" in reference to a statement, ordinarily refers to one authoring the statement or repeating it as his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*451</span> own; one who lends to a friend a book is not normally deemed to \"make\" the statements in the book. <i>See </i><i>Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v.

There is some breathing room: for example, imagine an underwriter orally or in writing specifically affirming to an investor the truth of specific statements in a prospectus that he knew to be false.</p>\n<p>Here, the SEC propounds a far more expansive view: it asks the courts to treat securities professionals as a matter of course as impliedly representing the entire contents of prospectuses whenever they sell securities or assist those who do. The argument against so sweeping a position begins with language, but it does not end there: congressional policy, Supreme Court precedent, practical consequences and the nearly uniform view of circuit courts that have spoken all argue against the SEC's proposed interpretation. It helps focus the issue, and underscores the reach of the SEC's position, to recite briefly the SEC's allegationsboth those rejected and not appealed, and those on appealas to Tambone and Hussey's relationship to and use of the Columbia Funds prospectuses.</p>\n<p>Tambone and Hussey were officers of Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc. (\"Columbia Distributor\"), which served as principal underwriter for Columbia mutual funds. As underwriters, they were required by law to furnish prospectuses to broker-dealers selling Columbia funds and to investors to whom they sold directly. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. § 77e(b) (2006); 17 C.F.R. § 240.15c2-8(b) (2009). The prospectuses, however, were drafted by a separate entity, Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. (\"Columbia Advisors\"), and the SEC admits in its complaint that Columbia Advisors rather than Columbia Distributor (and hence the defendants) \"remained primarily responsible for all representations made in the prospectuses for those funds.\"</p>\n<p>The SEC's more specific allegations concern the creation of the prospectuses and, separately, their use. The SEC complaint charged that the defendants were \"involved in the process of revising the prospectuses,\" \"reviewed the market timing representations before they were included in the prospectuses\" and \"comment[ed] on these representations to in-house counsel for Columbia Advisors.\" The district court found that these allegations failed to plead fraud with requisite particularity, <i>SEC v. Tambone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2327963\"><a href=\"/opinion/2327963/sec-v-tambone/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

[would] not by statement or omission be misleading.\" The district court again found that these allegations \"flatly fail[ed]\" to meet the particularity requirements. <i>Tambone,</i> 473 F.Supp.2d at 167. The SEC does not argue otherwise, nor does it point to any other specific oral or written statements made by the two defendants.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>The SEC's remaining allegations regarding the defendants' use of the prospectuses, which are before us, are simply that the defendants, as required, disseminated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*452</span> prospectuses to broker-dealers and investors in their capacity as underwriters. The SEC does not say that the defendants explicitly represented as true to investors the prospectuses' market timing provisions or that they even discussed the prospectuses with investors. The SEC instead claims that in selling securities, a defendant who neither personally authorized nor repeated an inaccurate statement nevertheless \"make[s]\" an implied statement or representation under Rule 10b-5(b) that the prospectuses prepared by the issuer are in all respects accurate and not materially misleading.</p>\n<p>Following <i>Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v.

There is no such conflict. My colleagues overstate the significance of <i>Central Bank</i> for the interpretive issue before us, fail to account for the underwriter's unique statutory duty to provide investors with accurate information, and misguidedly allow concerns about excessive private litigation to influence their judgment on the scope of public enforcement by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In my view, the language of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b), the underwriter's role and duties in the securities market, and decades of case lawincluding <i>Central Bank</i>inescapably permit the SEC to proceed against Tambone and Hussey for making false statements within the purview of Rule 10b-5(b). I therefore respectfully dissent.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The important issue before the en banc court is whether the defendants' <i>use</i> of false and misleading prospectus statements can constitute the <i>making</i> of statements that render the defendants primarily liable under Rule 10b-5(b). The Commission asserts that, as senior executives of the primary underwriter for the Columbia Funds, Tambone and Hussey had a duty to confirm the accuracy and completeness of the prospectuses they were responsible for distributing to broker-dealers and potential investors. It further contends that, by using the prospectuses as required to perform their duties to potential investors, defendants made implied statements asserting that they had a reasonable basis to believe that the key statements in the prospectuses regarding market timing were accurate and complete. Because the defendants allegedly knew that those statements were false, or were reckless in not knowing, their implied statements were also false. The SEC argues that these direct representations of Tambone and Hussey, albeit implied, subject the defendants to primary liability under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b).</p>\n<p>The majority dismisses the SEC's position as untenable on the basis of \"the language and structure of [the] rule, the statutory framework that it implements, and the teachings of the Supreme Court.\" It is the majority's view that is untenable. It construes the Rule to exclude the long accepted understanding that underwriters \"make\" implied statements to investors about the accuracy and completeness of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*454</span> prospectuses they are using to induce investments. It rejects primary liability for fraudulent conduct at the heart of Rule 10b-5's prohibitions by stretching <i>Central Bank</i> beyond both its text and context and using that unjustified expansion to justify its contraction of the Rule's scope.</p>\n<p>As I shall explain, the language of the statute and the Rule, viewed in the context of the unique role of underwriters in selling securities, supports the Commission's allegation that Tambone and Hussey made implied statements to investors that are actionable as primary violations of Rule 10b-5(b). I begin, however, by addressing the premise at the heart of the majority's positionits unfounded assumption that <i>Central Bank's</i> \"carefully drawn circumscription of the private right of action\" substantially changed the landscape for securities claims under Rule 10b-5 in the very different context of an SEC enforcement action against underwriters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Central Bank</i> and Rule 10b-5</h2>\n<p>The majority argues that reading Rule 10b-5(b) to reach the making of implied statements would be to disregard the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Central Bank</i> and to effectively eliminate the boundaries between primary and secondary liability required by that decision. This contention overstates the substance of the case and, consequently, its reach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. What the Court Decided</h2>\n<p>The issue in <i>Central Bank</i> was whether the bank, the indenture trustee for bonds issued by the public Building Authority to finance improvements at a planned development in Colorado Springs, could be held liable in a private cause of action under Rule 10b-5 for aiding and abetting a primary violation of the law. Although Central Bank had become aware that the collateral for the bonds had likely become insufficient to support them, it delayed undertaking an independent review of the original appraisal. Before an independent review could be done, the Building Authority defaulted on a portion of the bonds.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff raised claims of primary liability against four violators: the Building Authority, which issued the defaulted bonds in question, two underwriters for the bonds, and a director of the development company in charge of providing an appraisal of the bonds. The Building Authority defaulted early in the litigation and the claims against the underwriters were settled. <i>See </i><i>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A. v. Pring,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586995\"><a href=\"/opinion/586995/fed-sec-l-rep-p-96874-first-interstate-bank-of-denver-na-and-jack/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></a></span>, 893 n. 1 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court, relying on the text of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, concluded that the aiding and abetting claims against Central Bank had to be dismissed because <i>private</i> plaintiffs may only bring claims of primary liability, not aiding and abetting liability. Nevertheless, the Court noted that \"[i]n any complex securities fraud . . . there are likely to be multiple violators; in this case, for example, respondents named four defendants as primary violators.\"<sup>[17]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*455</span> 511 U.S. at 191, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117837\"><a href=\"/opinion/117837/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-of-denver-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1439</span></a></span>. Finally, the Court concluded that it is not the identity of a securities actor but his conduct that determines whether he may be liable as a primary violator:</p>\n<blockquote>The absence of § 10(b) aiding and abetting liability does not mean that secondary actors in the securities markets are always free from liability under the securities Acts. Any person or entity, including a lawyer, accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator under 10b-5, assuming all of the requirements for primary liability under Rule 10b-5 are met.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. What the Court Did Not Decide</h2>\n<p>The Court in <i>Central Bank</i> addressed only the question of \"whether private civil liability under § 10(b) extends as well to those who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptive practice, but who aid and abet the violation.\" 511 U.S. at 167, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117837\"><a href=\"/opinion/117837/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-of-denver-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1439</span></a></span> (\"The problem, of course, is that aiding and abetting liability extends beyond persons who engage, even indirectly, in a proscribed activity; aiding and abetting liability reaches persons who do not engage in the proscribed activities at all, but who give a degree of aid to those who do.\"). The issue here is whether the defendants <i>themselves</i> \"engage[d] in the manipulative or deceptive practice,\" i.e., whether the defendants' acts are \"sufficient to show that they `made' the [alleged] material misstatements and omissions . . . such that they can be held primarily liable.\" <i>SEC v. Wolfson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"171183\"><a href=\"/opinion/171183/sec-v-wolfson/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1249</span></a></span>, 1258 (10th Cir.2008). Holding Tambone and Hussey responsible for their own false implied statements does not threaten the primary/secondary dichotomy.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is critical to recognize that <i>Central Bank</i> analyzes the scope of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 in a suit brought by a private plaintiff. Although the Court focused on the text of the provisions, it also emphasized the element of reliance (which was not satisfied in that case), as well as a set of policy considerations that arise exclusively in the context of private securities litigation. <i>See</i> 511 U.S. at 173-178, 180, 188-89, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117837\"><a href=\"/opinion/117837/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-of-denver-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In this respect, <i>Central Bank</i> reflected the Court's desire to limit the scope of the judicially implied private cause of action under Rule 10b-5.<sup>[18]</sup> Indeed, the Court has consistently distinguished between the broad contours of the SEC's \"express statutory authority to enforce [Rule 10b-5],\" <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith v.

Distinguishing between Primary and Secondary Violations</h2>\n<p>Although the private action context limits <i>Central Bank's</i> significance for the SEC enforcement action at issue here, the Court did effect an important change in securities law by holding that aiding and abetting claims were no longer available in private actions. In its aftermath, lower courts sought to delineate the outer boundaries of primary liability, an issue the Supreme Court had not addressed. As the majority notes, our sister circuits have crafted two divergent standards to analyze the question: the \"bright-line\" test, associated most closely with the Second Circuit, and the broader \"substantial participation\" test, articulated by the Ninth Circuit. The majority observes that it is unnecessary to choose one of these paths in this case because the conduct at issue\"the use and dissemination of prospectuses created by others\"does not satisfy either test. I agree that there is no need to choose between these standards, but for a different reason: neither the bright-line nor substantial participation test is relevant here.</p>\n<p>The substantial participation test evaluates whether one actor can be deemed to have made a statement made or created by another because of the actor's \"substantial participation\" in the making or creation of that statement. In this case, the SEC alleges that Tambone and Hussey are accountable for their own implied statements, making the \"substantial participation\" inquiry unnecessary. <i>See In re LDK Solar Sec. Litig.,</i> No. C07-05182WHA, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4369987</span></span>, at *8 n. 9 (N.D.Cal. Sept.24, 2008) (declining to address defendants' claim that they had not \"substantially participated\" in making the fraudulent statements at issue because the court had already determined that they should be \"deemed actually to have made those statements\"). Similarly, the bright line test does not address what it means to \"make\" a statement. It simply requires that the defendant \"actually make\" the statement at issue, <i>Wright v. Ernst &amp; Young LLP,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757027\"><a href=\"/opinion/757027/fed-sec-l-rep-p-90266-irene-l-wright-on-behalf-of-herself-and-all/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span>, 175 (2d Cir. 1998), and it imposes an attribution requirement that is inapplicable to SEC enforcement actions because it relates to the element of reliance that is required only in a private Rule 10b-5 action. <i>See </i><i>Wolfson,</i> 539 F.3d at 1259-60 (observing that the attribution requirement \"stems directly from the need for <i>private</i> litigants to prove reliance on alleged fraud to succeed on a <i>private</i> cause of action\").</p>\n<p>Whether or not these tests are useful in distinguishing primary from secondary conduct, they shed no light on the issue that is before us: determining whether the defendants have \"made\" a statement, which unquestionably would subject them to primary liability.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*457</span> 4. The Limited Relevance of <i>Central Bank</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court in <i>Central Bank</i> focused on the crucial dichotomy between those who, regardless of their role in a securities transaction, make misleading representations themselves, and those who assist the culpable actor without personally using or employing any \"manipulative or deceptive device\" as prohibited by section 10(b). In this SEC enforcement action, primary liability is premised on the defendants' having themselves impliedly stated that they had a reasonable basis to believe that the market timing disclosures in the prospectuses were truthful and complete.</p>\n<p><i>Central Bank</i> does not address the important issue in this casewhether the defendants \"made\" statements within the meaning of Rule 10b-5(b)and we must look elsewhere for guidance. As I describe below, both the language of the Rule and substantial precedent on the role and status of underwriters in the distribution of securities support the SEC's argument that Tambone's and Hussey's alleged actions fall within the purview of the \"make a statement\" requirement of Rule 10b-5(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Scope of Liability under Rule 10b-5(b): Making a Statement</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1.

[t]o <i>use or employ,</i> in connection with the purchase or sale of any security . . ., any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) (emphasis <span class=\"star-pagination\">*458</span> added). The SEC's allegations against appellants are stated in precisely those statutory terms. The SEC avers that defendants <i>used</i> and <i>employed</i> prospectuses containing statements prohibiting market timing practicesstatements that they knew or were reckless in not knowing were falseand in so doing impliedly stated that they had a reasonable basis to believe that the market timing disclosures in the prospectuses were truthful and complete.</p>\n<p>The majority counters that one cannot \"`make' a statement when he merely uses a statement created entirely by others.\" It asserts that subsection (b) of Rule 10b-5 applies to only a subset of the conduct that falls within the statute's proscriptioni.e., only the literal \"making\" of statements and not all \"uses\" of them. <i>Id.</i> The majority reinforces this pronouncement by pointing out that another section of the Rule, 10b-5(a), <i>does</i> prohibit the \"employ[ment]\" of any \"device, scheme or artifice to defraud,\" and it concludes that this difference in language proves that subsection (b) of the Rule was deliberately framed as a narrower prohibition against \"making,\" but not \"using,\" statements.</p>\n<p>The question before us is not whether the words \"use\" and \"make\" are interchangeable, howeverI agree they are notbut whether the conduct that occurred here could constitute \"making\" a statement within the meaning of Rule 10b-5(b). The majority's position is that one cannot make a statement without explicitly speaking or writing the words at issue. The statutory language, howeverprohibiting the \"use,\" inter alia, of \"deceptive device[s]\"is broad enough to encompass less literal forms of \"making\" a statement. Indeed, it defies ordinary experience to say that a statement can only be \"made\" by \"the physical or manual act of writing or transcribing [a] report\" or speaking words. <i>State v. O'Neil,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></span>, 63 (1913). It is a commonplace observation that someone has \"made a statement\" through his or her conduct.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, a broader reading of \"make\" also is consistent with the dictionary definitions, which are more inclusive than the majority acknowledges and include \"deliver, utter, or put forth.\" <i>See The Random House Dictionary of the English Language</i> 1161 (2d ed.1987). Those meanings embrace the SEC's argument that, by using the prospectuses as they did, the defendants \"deliver[ed]\" or \"put forth\" implied statements of their own attesting to the accuracy and completeness of the prospectuses. In case law, as well as common parlance, this is not an unprecedented interpretation of the word \"make.\" In <i>Reass v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1544304\"><a href=\"/opinion/1544304/reass-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span> (4th Cir.1938), for example, the court held that \"making\" a false statement for purposes of a federal mortgage fraud statute meant communicating it and not merely composing it. <i>Id.</i> at 755. Although the majority correctly points out the very different context in <i>Reass,</i> the fact remains that the court did not confine \"making a statement\" to the literal meaning on which the majority insists. <i>See also, e.g., </i><i>O'Neil,</i> 135 P. at 63.</p>\n<p>To be sure, Rule 10b-5(b) contemplates some range of conduct narrower than the statute's all-encompassing \"use or employ.\" But that fact does not mean that particular uses of statements by particular players in the sale of securities cannot constitute the \"making\" of implied statements. The Rule thus does not require Tambone and Hussey to have explicitly spoken or written the false statement at issue here, i.e., that \"I have a reasonable basis for believing that the market timing disclosures in the prospectuses are truthful and complete.\" Rather, given the statutory duties imposed upon them as underwriters, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> <i>see infra,</i> that representation was implicit in the defendants' conduct in using the prospectuses to induce individuals to invest in Columbia Funds.</p>\n<p>As the SEC explains in its en banc brief, this understanding of what it means to \"make\" a statement is necessary to fulfill the objective of Congress and the Commission to punish \"any untrue statement of a material fact\" made with knowledge or reckless disregard for its truth. <i>See</i> Rule 10b-5(b). An underwriter could well know that representations in a prospectus are false even when the individual who actually wrote the words was unaware of the inaccuracies. In those circumstances, an underwriter who knowingly gives investors a prospectus containing falsehoods could not be held liable in an SEC enforcement action for aiding and abetting the unwitting drafter, who did not himself commit fraud. If such an underwriter could not be held responsible as a primary offender, the underwriter would, in the SEC's words, \"be free from any liability under Section 10(b) whatsoever.\"<sup>[20]</sup> It takes no stretch of the language of Rule 10b-5(b) to view such an underwriter as having attested to the accuracy of the prospectus contents, i.e., to have knowingly \"made\" an implied falsestatement to investors that the prospectus accurately describes the fund's risks. <i>See </i><i>Hanly v. SEC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"286339\"><a href=\"/opinion/286339/mortimer-w-hanly-arthur-gladstone-frederick-c-stutzmann-jr-steven/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span>, 597 (2d Cir.1969) (\"By [an underwriter's] recommendation he implies that a reasonable investigation has been made and that his recommendation rests on the conclusions based on such investigation.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Duties of an Underwriter</h2>\n<p>In assessing whether a defendant has committed a primary violation of the securities laws, courts have examined the defendant's role in the securities market in addition to the specific conduct alleged in the complaint. These decisions indicate that a defendant's general responsibilities and statutory duties with respect to the sale and distribution of securities inform the legal significance of specific conduct under Rule 10b-5(b). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Scholastic Corp.

Indeed, the Second Circuit has made the particularly relevant observation that \"[s]ilence <i>where there is a duty to disclose</i> can constitute a false or misleading statement within the meaning of § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.\" <i>Wright,</i> 152 F.3d at 177 (emphasis added). Thus, by virtue of his role in the securities market and his statutory duties, a defendant may make an implied statement without actually uttering the words in question.</p>\n<p>Underwriters play an essential role in the sale and distribution of mutual funds to the investing public, which occurs either directly or through other broker-dealers. The text and statutory history of the Securities Act of 1933, and specifically the statute's treatment of underwriters in sections <span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> 11<sup>[21]</sup> and 12,<sup>[22]</sup> highlight the unique position they occupy in the securities industry. As the Southern District of New York has observed in the context of evaluating several securities claims:</p>\n<blockquote>[I]n enacting Section 11, \"Congress recognized that underwriters occupied a unique position that enabled them to discover and compel disclosure of essential facts about the offering.

Thus, contrary to the majority's assertion, this is not a situation in which the liability alleged is based \"merely\" on the use of \"a statement created entirely by others.\" In this limited context, where the duties of underwriters to potential investors are prescribed by statute, the knowing or reckless use of a prospectus containing false statements involves the underwriter's own implied statement falsely affirming the accuracy of the prospectus content.</p>\n<p>The majority attempts to discredit some of this inconvenient precedent because it pre-dates <i>Central Bank.</i> The majority's treatment of <i>Chris-Craft,</i> which strongly supports the SEC's position, is illustrative. The Second Circuit held that an underwriter \"makes\" a statement under section 14(e) of the Exchange Act when constructively representing that registration materials are accurate and complete.<sup>[25]</sup> 480 F.2d at 370 (noting that, although an underwriter does not \"in a literal sense\" make statements to potential investors, we do not read § 14(e) so \"narrowly\"). The majority disregards <i>Chris-Craft</i> because it preceded <i>Central Bank</i> by more than twenty years, observing that the Second Circuit had no reason to distinguish between primary and secondary liability at that time. As the SEC points out, however, and our discussion above confirms, <i>Central Bank</i> did not diminish the statutory duties of underwriters or otherwise affect the courts' identification of the duties owed by underwriters to the investing public.</p>\n<p>Hence, <i>Chris-Craft</i> and similar cases may not be cast aside as no longer relevant. The majority errs in its dismissal of precedent, fully consistent with <i>Central Bank,</i> indicating that implied statements made by underwritersa unique class of securities professionalsmay fall within the scope of Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>My colleagues fear that including implied statements within the purview of Rule 10b-5(b) would trigger a flood of vexatious private lawsuits against a wide spectrum of participants in the securities industry. I cannot deny that private plaintiffs would try to push the SEC's implied statement position beyond its context in this case. That is a predictable and familiar phenomenon in our legal system. It then becomes the responsibility of courts to determine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*463</span> which attempts to expand the law are meritorious and which are not. Inescapably, this method of developing the law imposes costs on defendants who ultimately prevail. These inevitable costs should not deter us, however, from reaching the result required by the applicable law in the case before us. Specifically, they should not lead us here to circumscribe the authority of the SEC to meet its responsibility to the public to prevent fraud in the securities industry.</p>\n<p>In addition, the majority's fears discount too readily the particular context of this case. As I have described, underwriters play a unique role in the securities industry, and they have responsibilities and a statutory duty not shared by every securities professional. Indeed, the cases cited in the concurrence for the proposition that the implied representation theory \"has been regularly rejected by the circuits\" all involve secondary players, such as accountants, auditors and lawyers, who typically lack the \"trail guide\" relationship with the investing public that is the hallmark of the underwriter's role.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p>Tambone's and Hussey's implied statements about their belief in the accuracy of the prospectuses arise from their special status, enforced by statute, which is both widely acknowledged and of long duration.

Federal law imposes such a duty on underwriters,<sup>[27]</sup> and that duty provides the context in which an underwriter's conduct may generate an implied statement attesting to the accuracy of a prospectus the underwriter is using to sell securities. Plaintiffs seeking to expand the SEC's implied statement approach beyond underwriters will face the challenge of identifying an equivalent duty on the part of other actors in the securities industry.</p>\n<p>Moreover, private litigants face multiple burdens in pleading securities claims. Not only must they meet the standard requirement that allegations of fraud be pleaded with particularity, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), butunlike the SECthey also must prove reliance on the alleged misrepresentations, economic loss, and loss causation, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Stoneridge,</i> 552 U.S. at 157, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145837\"><a href=\"/opinion/145837/stoneridge-inv-partners-v-scientific-atl/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span>. The reliance requirement, in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*464</span> particular, weakens my colleagues' concern that private litigants will be able to bring impermissible aiding and abetting claims in the guise of primary claims. With significant barriers already in place to protect against excessive securities litigation by private plaintiffs, the way to protect against overreaching by private plaintiffs is to strictly enforce those requirements not to deny the SEC the full scope of its enforcement authority.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The underwriter's special duty to investors is anchored in statutes and administrative guidance and confirmed by case law whose relevant wisdom was unaffected by the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Central Bank.</i> In light of that duty, an underwriter who uses a prospectus in a securities transaction in the manner alleged here impliedly states that he has reason to believe the contents of the prospectus are accurate. If the underwriter knows, or is reckless in not knowing, that the statements contained within the prospectus are in fact false, the underwriter's implied statement is likewise false. An underwriter who makes such a statement has violated Rule 10b-5(b).</p>\n<p>The SEC in this case alleges that Tambone and Hussey made such statements to investors when they used the prospectuses containing false statements about timing practices to sell the Columbia Funds. They allegedly knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that those statements were false. These allegations were stated with sufficient particularity to meet the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), in conjunction with Rule 9(b).<sup>[28]</sup> Defendants' motions to dismiss the primary liability claims under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) should therefore have been denied.</p>\n<p>Hence, I would reverse the dismissal of the SEC's claims under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) and remand to the district court for further proceedings on those claims, as well as on the section 17(a)(2) and aiding and abetting claims.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  An earlier action, filed in February of 2005, was dismissed without prejudice for failure to plead fraud with particularity. That action is of no moment here.</p>\n<p>[2]  This contention was based on the SEC's allegations that the defendants reviewed and commented on the market timing statements before those statements were included in the prospectuses. We do not quote these allegations at length, as the SEC has not pursued this line of argument on appeal.</p>\n<p>[3]  In addition, the SEC argued that Tambone had made material misrepresentations by signing selling agreements in which he vouched for the accuracy of the statements in the prospectuses. Because the SEC has not pursued this argument on appeal, we disregard it. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p>[4]  The panel parted ways only with respect to the Rule 10b-5(b) claims. <i>See </i><i>Tambone II,</i> 550 F.3d at 149 (Selya, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>[5]  That section provides in pertinent part:\n</p>\n<p>It shall be unlawful for any person . . ., directly or indirectly</p>\n<p>(1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, or</p>\n<p>(2) to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or</p>\n<p>(3) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.</p>\n<p>15 U.S.C. § 77q(a).</p>\n<p>[6]  The SEC has in fact brought a separate section 17(a)(2) claim against the defendants in this case. That claim is not before the en banc court.</p>\n<p>[7]  The SEC also endeavors to prop up its \"use\" theory of Rule 10b-5(b) liability by referring to a venerable Fourth Circuit case deciding, for venue purposes, whether a defendant violated a federal mortgage fraud statute in West Virginia or in Pennsylvania. <i>See </i><i>Reass v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1544304\"><a href=\"/opinion/1544304/reass-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span>, 755 (4th Cir.1938).\n</p>\n<p>The only reason the opinion has even an epsilon's worth of relevance to the issue at hand is that the challenged statute rendered it unlawful to \"make[] any statement, knowing it to be false, for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of a Federal Home Loan Bank upon any application for loan.\" <i>Id.</i> at 752. But the <i>Reass</i> court did not presume to act as a legal lexicographer, chiseling in stone a definition of \"make\" for all time and for every purpose. The result in <i>Reass</i> proceeds from the simple proposition that the statute could not be violated until the defendant presented the misstatements to the bank \"upon. . . application for a loan.\" <i>Id.</i> at 755.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although the <i>Central Bank</i> Court focused its inquiry on section 10(b), its methodology is equally applicable to Rule 10b-5. The rule is incorporated into the statutory framework and, thus, its scope \"is coextensive with the coverage of § 10(b).\" <i>Zandford,</i> 535 U.S. at 816 n. 1, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118513\"><a href=\"/opinion/118513/sec-v-zandford/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Fidelity to the text of section 10(b) requires fidelity to the text of Rule 10b-5 and, therefore, fidelity to the text of each of the subsections that comprise the rule.</p>\n<p>[9]  For example, the bright-line test cannot be imported wholesale into the public enforcement context because its attribution prong reflects the need to prove reliance, <i>see </i><i>Wright,</i> 152 F.3d at 175an element that the SEC need not establish in a Rule 10b-5 case. <i>See </i><i>Schellenbach v.

However, this quotation from <i>Central Bank</i> illustrates the Supreme Court's recognition that a securities fraud will likely involve multiple violators, thereby suggesting that individuals with different responsibilities could be primarily liable for the same misstatement. <i>See</i> 511 U.S. at 191, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117837\"><a href=\"/opinion/117837/central-bank-of-denver-na-v-first-interstate-bank-of-denver-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1439</span></a></span>. Therefore, the primary liability of Columbia Advisors does not preclude the primary liability of Tambone and Hussey for their own use of the false and misleading statements contained in those prospectuses. The Supreme Court recently confirmed this principle in a private lawsuit by indicating that defendants Charter Communications, Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., and Motorola, Inc., had all engaged in the fraudulent conduct at issue. <i>See </i><i>Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145837\"><a href=\"/opinion/145837/stoneridge-inv-partners-v-scientific-atl/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 158-61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145837\"><a href=\"/opinion/145837/stoneridge-inv-partners-v-scientific-atl/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although the Court's statement in <i>Central Bank</i> referred to Rule 10b-5(b), addressing material statements and omissions, and its comment in <i>Stoneridge</i> applied to 10b-5(a) or (c), addressing other types of deceptive conduct, the scope of primary liability in each subsection is governed by the language of section 10(b) of the Exchange Act. Therefore, the Supreme Court's recent confirmation that multiple individuals may be primarily liable under Rule 10b-5(a) or (c) is applicable to its interpretation of Rule 10b-5(b).</p>\n<p>[18]  <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v.

Several circuits have adopted the proposition that federal securities law cannot establish the requisite duty. <i>Id.</i> That exclusion would be inappropriate for underwriters, whose unique duty to investors is deeply embedded in federal law independent of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <i>See supra</i> Section B.2.</p>\n<p>[28]  The allegations in the SEC's complaint are described in detail in the panel decision, <i>SEC v.

It suffices to say that the SEC meticulously identified the alleged misrepresentations, the defendants' roles in overseeing the distribution of fund prospectuses in connection with the sale of Columbia Funds, and the basis for their knowledge or recklessness in not knowing that prohibited market timing arrangements existed (rendering the prospectus statements false).</p>\n\n</div>",
