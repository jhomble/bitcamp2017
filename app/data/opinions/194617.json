Because\n\nenforcing  the  lease  despite   the  termination-upon-insolvency\n\nclause comports with the provisions of the Financial Institutions\n\nReform, Recovery, and Enforcement  Act of 1989 (FIRREA),  Pub. L.\n\nNo. 101-73,  103  Stat. 183  (codified  as amended  in  scattered\n\nsections of 12 U.S.C.),  and because such enforcement constitutes\n\nneither a  retroactive application  of the newly  enacted statute\n\nnor an unconstitutional taking of appellant's property, we affirm\n\nthe judgment below.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          In  1986, plaintiff-appellant Edward  McAndrews, in his\n\ncapacity as  trustee of the Iyanough Realty Trust, purchased real\n\nestate situated at 375 Iyanough Road, Hyannis, Massachusetts (the\n\nHyannis property).  At the time, the premises were under lease to\n\nMerchants Bank  &amp; Trust Company of Cape Cod.  The lease, executed\n\nin  1969,  provided for  a 20-year  term  with a  20-year renewal\n\noption.  After appellant acquired  the Hyannis property, the Bank\n\nof New  England (BNE) merged  with Merchants Bank  and seasonably\n\nexercised the option.\n\n          Subsequently, Congress enacted FIRREA, thus providing a\n\nmechanism to deal with  financially distressed banks in a  manner\n\nthat  preserves  their  going  concern  value  and  enhances  the\n\nprospects  of  orderly  administration  during   troubled  times.\n\n                                2\n\nFIRREA includes\n\na provision  allowing the  Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation\n\n(FDIC), as receiver, to enforce contracts previously entered into\n\nby failed banks  notwithstanding contractual provisions  designed\n\nto  guard  against exactly  that eventuality.    See 12  U.S.C.  \n                                                    \n\n1821(e)(12)(A) (Supp.  III 1991).1   This section  has particular\n\npertinence  in  the present  situation  since  the Hyannis  lease\n\ncontains a  termination-upon-insolvency  clause (which  we  shall\n\ncall  an ipso facto clause) permitting the lessor to abrogate the\n                   \n\nlease if any regulatory  authority, such as the FDIC,  takes over\n\nthe tenant bank.2\n\n          FIRREA  was effective  on  the date  of its  enactment,\n\nviz.,  August 9, 1989.  See Demars  v. First Serv. Bank for Sav.,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n     1The statute provides  in relevant part  that the FDIC,  qua\n                                                                 \nreceiver,\n\n          may enforce  any contract . .  . entered into\n          by the depository institution notwithstanding\n          any  provision of the  contract providing for\n          termination,   default,   acceleration,    or\n          exercise of rights upon, or solely  by reason\n          of,  insolvency  or  the  appointment   of  a\n          conservator or receiver.\n\n12 U.S.C.   1821(e)(12)(A).\n\n     2The ipso facto  clause is  embodied in section  6.1 of  the\n                    \nlease.  It states:\n\n          If . . .  the Lessee is closed or  taken over\n          by the banking authority of  the Commonwealth\n          of  Massachusetts  or other  bank supervisory\n          authority,  .  . .  the  Lessor  lawfully may\n          immediately or  at  any time  thereafter  and\n          without  demand or  notice,  enter  upon  the\n          premises or  any part thereof in  the name of\n          the whole, and  repossess the same . .  . and\n          expel the Lessee . . . .\n\n                                3\n\n907  F.2d  1237,  1238-39  (1st  Cir.  1990).    Seventeen months\n\nthereafter,  BNE failed.  The  FDIC was appointed  as receiver on\n\nJanuary  6, 1991.   It organized a so-called  bridge bank, see 12\n                                                              \n\nU.S.C.   1821(n)(1)(A) (Supp. III 1991), named it New Bank of New\n\nEngland  (NBNE),  and  assigned  the leasehold  interest  in  the\n\nHyannis property to it.  See 12 U.S.C.   1821(n)(3)(A) (Supp. III\n                            \n\n1991).  When appellant, relying on the lease's terms, served NBNE\n\nwith a notice to quit, the bank stood fast, asserting that FIRREA\n\nrendered the ipso facto clause unenforceable.\n                       \n\n          Appellant  then  sought  a  declaration  of  rights  in\n\nfederal  district court, naming NBNE and FDIC as defendants.3  He\n\nargued  that section  1821(e)(12)(A)  should only  be applied  to\n\nleases executed  after FIRREA's  effective date.   In appellant's\n\nview, applying the statute to  a preexisting lease containing  an\n\nipso  facto clause  effectively nullifies  the clause,  therefore\n           \n\nconstituting an improper retroactive  application of the statute;\n\nand, moreover, effects a taking without compensation in violation\n\nof the Fifth Amendment.\n\n          The  district court  rejected these  twin asseverations\n\nand granted summary judgment in defendants' favor.  See McAndrews\n                                                                 \n\nv.  New Bank  of New  England, 796  F. Supp.  613, 616  (D. Mass.\n                             \n\n1992).  McAndrews appeals.\n\nII.  RETROACTIVE APPLICATION\n\n          It  is a  settled  rule that  courts  should not  apply\n\n                    \n\n     3In July 1991, Fleet  Bank of Massachusetts purchased NBNE's\nleasehold interest in  the Hyannis property.  Fleet  has replaced\nNBNE as a defendant and appellee.\n\n                                4\n\nstatutes retroactively  when doing so would  significantly impair\n\nexisting  substantive  rights  and,  thus,  disappoint legitimate\n\nexpectations.   See, e.g., Bradley v. Richmond Sch. Bd., 416 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n696,  711 (1974); FDIC v.  Longley I Realty  Trust,     F.2d    ,\n                                                  \n\n    (1st Cir.  1993) [No. 92-1770, slip op. at  5]; C.E.K. Indus.\n                                                                 \n\nMechanical  Contractors, Inc. v. NLRB, 921 F.2d 350, 358 n.7 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1990); cf.  American Trucking  Ass'ns v. Smith,  110 S.  Ct.\n                                                   \n\n2323, 2338 (1990) (explaining retroactivity principles in respect\n\nto judge-made law).   In the instant case, appellant  posits that\n\napplying  section  1821(e)(12)(A) to  trump a  preexisting escape\n\nclause  must be  considered a  retroactive application  of FIRREA\n\nand, as such, improper.  We do not agree.\n\n          The determination of whether a statute's application in\n\na particular situation is prospective or retroactive depends upon\n\nwhether  the  conduct  that   allegedly  triggers  the  statute's\n\napplication  occurs before  or  after the  law's effective  date.\n\nHence, a statute's application is usually deemed prospective when\n\nit implicates conduct  occurring on or after  the effective date.\n\nSee Cox v. Hart, 260 U.S. 427, 434-35 (1922); EPA  v. New Orleans\n                                                                 \n\nPub. Serv., Inc.,  826 F.2d 361,  365 (5th Cir.  1987); see  also\n                                                                 \n\nAllied  Corp. v.  Acme  Solvents Reclaiming,  Inc., 691  F. Supp.\n                                                  \n\n1100, 1110 (N.D. Ill.  1988); King v. Mordowanec, 46  F.R.D. 474,\n                                                \n\n482 (D.R.I.  1969).   Even when the  later-occurring circumstance\n\ndepends upon the existence of a prior fact, that interdependence,\n\nwithout  more,  will  not  transform  an   otherwise  prospective\n\napplication  into a retroactive one.  See New York Cent. &amp; Hudson\n                                                                 \n\n                                5\n\nRiver  R.R. Co. v.  United States (No.  2), 212 U.S.  500, 505-06\n                                          \n\n(1909) (holding that a  statute prohibiting rebates could validly\n\nbe applied to a rebate  paid after the act's effective date  with\n\nrespect to property transported before the act's effective date);\n\nGonsalves v. Flynn, 981  F.2d 45, 48-49 (1st Cir.  1992) (holding\n                  \n\nthat an  amendment to a tolling  provision operates prospectively\n\nwhen it bars a suit filed after its enactment, even  if the claim\n\naccrued  before the law changed).  Phrased another way, a statute\n\ndoes  not operate  retroactively simply  because its  application\n\nrequires some reference to  antecedent facts.  See Cox,  260 U.S.\n                                                      \n\nat 435; see also New Orleans Pub. Serv., 826 F.2d at 365 (\"A  law\n                                       \n\nis  not   made  retroactive   because  it  alters   the  existing\n\nclassification of a thing.\").\n\n          This  means, of course,  that a statute  may modify the\n\nlegal  effect   of  a  present  status  or  alter  a  preexisting\n\nrelationship without running up against the retroactivity hurdle.\n\nThe key lies in how the law interacts with the facts.  So long as\n\na neoteric law determines status solely for the purpose of future\n\nmatters, its application is deemed prospective.  See New  Orleans\n                                                                 \n\nPub. Serv., 826 F.2d at 365.\n          \n\n          Employing  these first  principles,  FIRREA's reach  in\n\nthis  case  cannot  be  deemed  retroactive.    Signing  a  lease\n\ncontaining  an  ipso  facto  clause does  not  in  itself unleash\n                           \n\nsection  1821(e)(12)(A).   Only  subsequent events  can pull  the\n\ntrigger.  Here, for example, FIRREA was brought into play through\n\na  collocation of  circumstances,  all occurring  well after  the\n\n                                6\n\nlaw's  effective  date:    the tenant's  insolvency,  the  FDIC's\n\nappointment as  receiver, and  the landlord's attempt  to utilize\n\nthe lease's escape hatch.   It follows that, because  the conduct\n\ntriggering the statute's application occurred long after FIRREA's\n\nenactment, using section 1821(e) to  trump the ipso facto  clause\n                                                         \n\nconstitutes a prospective use  of the statute regardless of  when\n\nthe lease was executed.4   Any other result would  twist FIRREA's\n\nstructure,  do violence  to  its clear  language, and  needlessly\n\nfrustrate Congress's  intent to  \"deal expeditiously  with failed\n\nfinancial  institutions.\"   H.R.  Conf. Rep.  No. 101-222,  101st\n\nCong.,  1st Sess.  (1989),  reprinted in  1989 U.S.C.C.A.N.  432.\n                                        \n\nAfter all, if courts were to construe FIRREA so as to shield from\n\nits  grasp  all  claims  arising  from  contracts  formed  before\n\nFIRREA's enactment, Congress's efforts to protect the public from\n\nexisting and anticipated bank failures would be hamstrung.\n\n                    \n\n     4In  attempting  to  buttress  its claim  of  retroactivity,\nappellant relies on  United States v.  Security Indus. Bank,  459\n                                                           \nU.S. 70 (1982),  and Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S.  704 (1987).  Both\n                                    \ncases  are  inapposite.  Security Bank stands for the proposition\n                                      \nthat  an  attempted  invalidation  of liens  perfected  prior  to\npassage of  the Bankruptcy  Reform Act constituted  a retroactive\napplication of the Act.  459 U.S. at 78-79.  That situation would\nbe analogous to, say,  an FDIC attempt to undo  a landlord's pre-\nFIRREA eviction  of an  insolvent bank tenant.   That is  not the\ncase at bar.\n          Hodel   involved   a    statute   forbidding    certain\n               \ntestamentary  transfers.   As  applied, the  statute operated  to\nextinguish devises  originating with  individuals who  died after\nthe act's effective date.   See 481 U.S. at 709.   Significantly,\n                               \nthe question of whether,  as a matter of statutory  construction,\nthe  act  must  be  deemed   to  operate  retroactively  when  it\nimplicates wills drawn before the effective date was a non-issue.\nRather,  the court  examined whether  the property  regulation as\napplied constituted  an unconstitutional taking  under the  Fifth\nAmendment.  See id. at 713-18.\n                   \n\n                                7\n\n          Our conclusion that the district court's use of section\n\n1821(e) did not constitute a retroactive application is fortified\n\nby three  other  pieces of  supporting data.   The  first is  the\n\nopinion in Hawke Assocs. v. City Fed. Sav. Bank, 787 F. Supp. 423\n                                               \n\n(D.N.J. 1991).  To all intents and purposes, Hawke is squarely on\n                                                  \n\npoint.  There, the court applied section 1821(e)(12)(A) to render\n\nunenforceable a lease  termination clause similar  to the one  at\n\nissue  here.   See id.  at 426-27.   While  the parties  in Hawke\n                                                                 \n\nsigned the lease nearly two  years before FIRREA's enactment, the\n\ntenant  entered  receivership  four  months after  the  statute's\n\neffective date.5  See id. at 424.\n                         \n\n          Second,  we  find  instructive the  caselaw  construing\n\nsection  365(e)(1) of the Bankruptcy  Code, 11 U.S.C.   365(e)(1)\n\n(1988).   Courts  have consistently  held  that section  365,  an\n\nenactment   which  renders   termination-upon-insolvency  clauses\n\nunenforceable  in bankruptcy,  applies  to  leases predating  the\n\nCode.   See, e.g., Matter  of Triangle Lab., Inc.,  663 F.2d 463,\n                                                 \n\n467 (3d Cir. 1981) (observing that   365(e)(1) controls \"leases .\n\n.  . executed prior to the effective  date of the Code\" when \"the\n                   \n\nevent which trigger[s] the bankruptcy termination clause occur[s]\n\nafter the effective  date of  the Code\"); In  Re Sapolin  Paints,\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     5There are other  decisions to  like effect.   In Longley  I\n                                                                 \nRealty Trust,     F.2d at     [slip op. at 8], this court applied\n            \na FIRREA provision codified  at 12 U.S.C.   1823(e) to nullify an\nalleged  oral agreement  originating before  the  Act's effective\ndate. In RTC v.  Southern Union Co., No. MO-91-CA-120  (W.D. Tex.\n                                   \nJuly  7, 1992),  the  Resolution  Trust Corporation  successfully\ninvoked,  inter   alia,  section  1821(e)(12)(A)   to  enforce  a\n                      \nrepurchase agreement that predated FIRREA.\n\n                                8\n\nInc.,  5 B.R.  412, 414-17 (Bankr.  E.D.N.Y. 1980)  (nullifying a\n    \n\ntermination-upon-bankruptcy clause  in a lease that  predated the\n\nCode  where the  lessee's  insolvency occurred  after the  Code's\n\neffective date).  We think the analogy between the concinnous use\n\nof Code section 365(e)(1) and  FIRREA section 1821(e)(1)(A) is  a\n\npowerful one.\n\n          Third,  we take  some modest  comfort in  the awareness\n\nthat  a variety  of FIRREA  provisions,  albeit provisions  of an\n\nessentially procedural  nature, have  been held to  affect claims\n\narising  out   of  contracts  entered  into   prior  to  FIRREA's\n\nenactment.    See,  e.g.,  Demars, 907  F.2d  at  1239  (applying\n                                 \n\nFIRREA's grant  of federal jurisdiction  to cases pending  at the\n\ntime of enactment); In Re Resolution Trust Corp., 888 F.2d 57, 58\n                                                \n\n(8th Cir. 1989) (same);  Triland Holdings &amp; Co. v.  Sunbelt Serv.\n                                                                 \n\nCorp.,  884 F.2d 205, 207 (5th Cir. 1989) (same); see also United\n                                                                 \n\nBank v. First  Republic Bank Waco, 758 F. Supp.  1166, 1168 (W.D.\n                                 \n\nTex. 1991) (applying  FIRREA's administrative  claims process  to\n\ncases pending on FIRREA's effective date).\n\n          For  these reasons,  we  reject  appellant's  principal\n\nassignment of error, concluding  that, by construing section 1821\n\nto trump the lease's preexisting ipso facto clause,  the district\n                                           \n\ncourt  carried  out  a  proper  prospective  application  of  the\n\nstatute.\n\nIII.  THE TAKINGS CLAUSE\n\n          We  move  now to  appellant's  fallback  position.   He\n\nasserts that applying FIRREA to thwart a preexisting termination-\n\n                                9\n\nupon-insolvency clause  violates the  Fifth Amendment.6   On this\n\npoint, appellant argues that his inability to abort the lease and\n\nrepossess the property notwithstanding the  tenant bank's failure\n\ndestroys  his  right  to the  use  and  enjoyment  of the  leased\n\npremises,  thereby effecting  an unconstitutional  taking without\n\ncompensation analogous to  those arising from  various proscribed\n\nphysical invasions.  See,  e.g., Lucas v. South  Carolina Coastal\n                                                                 \n\nCouncil,  112 S. Ct.  2886, 2893 (1992);  Loretto v. Teleprompter\n                                                                 \n\nManhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 435-38 (1982).  We  test this\n                    \n\nproposition.\n\n          The concept  of a  \"taking\" within  the meaning  of the\n\nFifth Amendment defies precise  definition.7  Indeed, the Supreme\n\nCourt  has  \"eschewed the  development  of any  set  formula\" for\n\ndetermining   which   property-right   infringements   constitute\n\ncompensable  takings,   relying  \"instead  on  ad   hoc,  factual\n\ninquiries  into  the  circumstances  of  each  particular  case.\"\n\n                    \n\n     6The Fifth Amendment states in part that:\n\n               No  person shall  . .  . be  deprived of\n          life,  liberty,  or  property,   without  due\n          process of law; nor shall private property be\n          taken   for   public   use,    without   just\n          compensation.\n\nU.S. Const. amend. V.\n\n     7Withal, the court has identified two discrete categories of\nregulatory   takings  that,  if  left  uncompensated,  constitute\nunconstitutional takings per se.  These categories, which need no\n                               \n\"case-specific  inquiry into  the  public  interest  advanced  in\nsupport of  the restraint,\" are (1)  permanent physical invasions\nand (2) regulations which  \"den[y] all economically beneficial or\nproductive use  of  land.\"   Lucas,  112 S.  Ct.  at 2893.    The\n                                  \nrestriction at issue in this case falls into neither category.\n\n                                10\n\nConnolly  v. Pension  Benefit  Guar.  Corp.,  475 U.S.  211,  224\n                                           \n\n(1986).   Three factors that  rank paramount in  this inquiry are\n\n(1) the regulation's \"economic impact\" on the property owner, (2)\n\nthe  extent to  which  the regulation  interferes with  \"distinct\n\ninvestment-backed expectations,\"  and (3) the  \"character\" of the\n\ninterference, that  is, whether  the governmental action  is more\n\nakin to a  physical invasion  or to a  necessary readjustment  of\n\neconomic benefits and  burdens.   Penn Cent. Transp.  Co. v.  New\n                                                                 \n\nYork City, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978); accord Connolly, 475 U.S. at\n                                                    \n\n225; Ruckelshaus  v. Monsanto  Co.,  467 U.S.  986, 1005  (1984).\n                                  \n\nThis trichotomous  test compels  the conclusion that  the alleged\n\ninfringement here in no way constitutes a compensable taking.\n\n          We first  assess the  severity of the  economic impact.\n\nThe  hallmark of an  unconstitutional taking  is, of  course, the\n\ndenial  of the  \"economically viable  use of [an  owner's] land.\"\n\nAgins v. City  of Tiburon, 447  U.S. 255, 260  (1980).  Thus,  an\n                         \n\ninfringement  that  leaves virtually  the  whole  of the  owner's\n\npossessory  rights intact  does not  constitute a  taking.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  Penn Cent.,  438  U.S.  at  130-31;  Gilbert  v.  City  of\n                                                                 \n\nCambridge, 932 F.2d 51, 56 (1st Cir.) (rejecting takings argument\n         \n\nwhere  the regulation  in question  \"preserve[d]  an economically\n\nviable  property use to landlords\"), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 192\n                                                 \n\n(1991).   Put  another  way, \"where  an  owner possesses  a  full\n\n`bundle' of property rights,  the destruction of one `strand'  of\n\nthe bundle is not a taking, because the  aggregate must be viewed\n\nin its entirety.\"  Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 65-66 (1979).\n                                   \n\n                                11\n\n          The   economic   regulation   involved  here   deprives\n\nappellant  only  of his  right to  terminate  the lease  upon the\n\nFDIC's appointment  as  receiver.    He still  enjoys  all  other\n\ncommon-law rights particular to  lessors; all other provisions in\n\nthe lease, including those that allow appellant  to terminate the\n\nlease for, say,  breach of the agreement to pay  rent in a timely\n\nfashion or breach  of the  covenant to maintain  the premises  in\n\ngood  order, remain in  full force.   FIRREA's application, then,\n\ncan  hardly be  said to  deprive appellant  of anything  remotely\n\nresembling his entire bundle of rights.\n\n          What is  more, the present tenant,  as FDIC's assignee,\n\nis not  a free rider.   It  must use  the premises  only for  the\n\npurposes permitted in  the lease, abide by the lease's covenants,\n\nand  pay the rent and  other emoluments stipulated  in the lease.\n\nThus,  the  only  economic harm  that  befalls  appellant  from a\n\nfrustration  of the  ipso facto  clause is  whatever anticipatory\n                               \n\nharm  may stem from his  lost opportunity to  re-rent the Hyannis\n\nproperty at a  potentially more  lucrative rate.   Such a  \"loss\"\n\ndoes not weigh heavily in the constitutional balance.  See id. at\n                                                              \n\n66  (observing  that  \"the  interest  in  anticipated  gains  has\n\ntraditionally been viewed as less compelling than other property-\n\nrelated  interests\").    In   the  circumstances  of  this  case,\n\nextinguishing  appellant's  preexisting  right  to  terminate the\n\nlease  upon the  bank  tenant's failure  creates  only a  minimal\n\nimpairment of appellant's overall rights in the Hyannis property.\n\n          The second significant factor in determining whether  a\n\n                                12\n\nregulation constitutes  a Fifth  Amendment taking  implicates the\n\nextent  of the interference  with investment-backed expectations.\n\nThe  inquiry  into  this  factor further  undermines  appellant's\n\nposition.\n\n          Although  prudent landlords pepper leases with a myriad\n\nof provisions designed to guard against worst-case contingencies,\n\nlandlords  nevertheless lease  property in  the expectation  that\n\nthey  will receive  the agreed-upon  rent, not  in the  hope that\n\nadverse  contingencies will  materialize  and  bring  contractual\n\nsafeguards  into  play.    Moreover,  considering  the  pervasive\n\nregulation that has long characterized the banking industry, see,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  Fahey v. Mallonee, 332  U.S. 245, 250  (1947) (\"Banking is\n                        \n\none of  the  longest regulated  and  most closely  supervised  of\n\npublic callings.\"), no reasonable  landlord would anticipate that\n\nevery provision in a long-term bank  lease will remain unaffected\n\nby subsequent changes in federal law.  Those who  deal with firms\n\nin regulated industries must expect that their dealings will from\n\ntime  to time  be affected by  statutory and  regulatory changes.\n\nSee Connolly, 475 U.S. at 227.\n            \n\n          Given  that  the  reasonable  expectation  to  which  a\n\nlandlord  is entitled is an  uninterrupted stream of  rent at the\n\ncontract  rate, not  the future  exercise of  a termination-upon-\n\ninsolvency clause,  FIRREA cannot be viewed as interfering with a\n\nvested property  interest, the usurpation of  which would require\n\ncompensation.  See Penn Cent., 438 U.S. at 124-25 (observing that\n                             \n\n                                13\n\ngovernment  actions, even  those which  \"cause[] economic  harm,\"\n\ncannot be  considered takings  when they  do not  \"interfere with\n\ninterests that  [are] sufficiently  bound up with  the reasonable\n\nexpectations of  the claimant to constitute  `property' for Fifth\n\nAmendment  purposes\").    In  the last  analysis,  FIRREA  leaves\n\nappellant firmly in possession  of the essence of that  for which\n\nhe bargained:  a fixed rent for a fixed period.\n\n          Turning to the third  factor, we do not think  that the\n\ngovernmental action here at  issue resembles a physical invasion.\n\nThe government, through FIRREA, is  not appropriating appellant's\n\nproperty for its  own use.   Rather,  it is  altering the  future\n\noperation  of  landlords'  and tenants'  preexisting  contractual\n\nrights in order to stem the disruption of banking services within\n\ncommunities, lessen  the costs  of bank liquidation,  and restore\n\npublic confidence  in the  nation's banking  system.   In  short,\n\nFIRREA's role here is  to reallocate economic pluses  and minuses\n\nin what  we find to be  an apt illustration of  the aphorism that\n\n\"Congress  routinely  creates  burdens  for  some  that  directly\n\nbenefit others.\"   Connolly, 475 U.S.  at 223.  There  is nothing\n                           \n\nwrong  per se with such  expressions of legislative  will or with\n             \n\nthe readjustments that they produce.\n\n          In a nutshell, the character of the governmental action\n\nstrongly favors  the  appellees' position.   The  mere fact  that\n\nfuture  obeisance to the newly enacted law might cause a property\n\nowner, as  in this case, to  forgo an opportunity for  gain is no\n\nmore than a necessary  consequence of FIRREA's regulatory regime.\n\n                                14\n\nHence, if there is  an invasion of a property right at all, it is\n\na  tiny invasion  of  a lambent  right,  arising \"from  a  public\n\nprogram that adjusts the benefits and burdens of economic life to\n\npromote  the common  good,\" id.  at 225, and,  as such,  does not\n                               \n\nconstitute a  taking.  See  id.; accord  Andrus, 444 U.S.  at 65;\n                                               \n\nPenn Cent., 438 U.S. at 124; Usery v. Turner  Elkhorn Mining Co.,\n                                                                \n\n428 U.S. 1,  15-16 (1976);  Pennsylvania Coal Co.  v. Mahon,  260\n                                                           \n\nU.S. 393, 413 (1922).\n\n          We  need  go no  further.    Here, the  three  integers\n\ncomposing the applicable  equation unanimously suggest  rejection\n\nof appellant's Takings Clause argument.  We heed that counsel.\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          To  recapitulate,  applying  section 1821(e)(12)(A)  to\n\ntrump the ipso facto clause in the Hyannis lease is a prospective\n                    \n\napplication  of  FIRREA  and,  thus, lawful.    Furthermore,  the\n\nresulting  impairment of  the landlord's  right to  terminate the\n\nlease upon the tenant bank's failure does not infract the Takings\n\nClause.  The judgment of the district court must, therefore, be\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                15\n",

BACKGROUND\n\n          In  1986, plaintiff-appellant Edward  McAndrews, in his\n\ncapacity as  trustee of the Iyanough Realty Trust, purchased real\n\nestate situated at 375 Iyanough Road, Hyannis, Massachusetts (the\n\nHyannis property).  At the time, the premises were under lease to\n\nMerchants Bank  &amp; Trust Company of Cape Cod.  The lease, executed\n\nin  1969,  provided for  a 20-year  term  with a  20-year renewal\n\noption.  After appellant acquired  the Hyannis property, the Bank\n\nof New  England (BNE) merged  with Merchants Bank  and seasonably\n\nexercised the option.\n\n          Subsequently, Congress enacted FIRREA, thus providing a\n\nmechanism to deal with  financially distressed banks in a  manner\n\nthat  preserves  their  going  concern  value  and  enhances  the\n\nprospects  of  orderly  administration  during   troubled  times.\n\n                                2\n\nFIRREA includes\n\na provision  allowing the  Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation\n\n(FDIC), as receiver, to enforce contracts previously entered into\n\nby failed banks  notwithstanding contractual provisions  designed\n\nto  guard  against exactly  that eventuality.    See 12  U.S.C.  \n                                                    \n\n1821(e)(12)(A) (Supp.  III 1991).1   This section  has particular\n\npertinence  in  the present  situation  since  the Hyannis  lease\n\ncontains a  termination-upon-insolvency  clause (which  we  shall\n\ncall  an ipso facto clause) permitting the lessor to abrogate the\n                   \n\nlease if any regulatory  authority, such as the FDIC,  takes over\n\nthe tenant bank.2\n\n          FIRREA  was effective  on  the date  of its  enactment,\n\nviz.,  August 9, 1989.  See Demars  v. First Serv. Bank for Sav.,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n     1The statute provides  in relevant part  that the FDIC,  qua\n                                                                 \nreceiver,\n\n          may enforce  any contract . .  . entered into\n          by the depository institution notwithstanding\n          any  provision of the  contract providing for\n          termination,   default,   acceleration,    or\n          exercise of rights upon, or solely  by reason\n          of,  insolvency  or  the  appointment   of  a\n          conservator or receiver.\n\n12 U.S.C.   1821(e)(12)(A).\n\n     2The ipso facto  clause is  embodied in section  6.1 of  the\n                    \nlease.  It states:\n\n          If . . .  the Lessee is closed or  taken over\n          by the banking authority of  the Commonwealth\n          of  Massachusetts  or other  bank supervisory\n          authority,  .  . .  the  Lessor  lawfully may\n          immediately or  at  any time  thereafter  and\n          without  demand or  notice,  enter  upon  the\n          premises or  any part thereof in  the name of\n          the whole, and  repossess the same . .  . and\n          expel the Lessee . . . .\n\n                                3\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544602\"><a href=\"/opinion/544602/j-paul-demars-dba-j-paul-demars-construction-v-first-service-bank-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1238-39  (1st  Cir.  1990).    Seventeen months\n\nthereafter,  BNE failed.  The  FDIC was appointed  as receiver on\n\nJanuary  6, 1991.   It organized a so-called  bridge bank, see 12\n                                                              \n\nU.S.C.   1821(n)(1)(A) (Supp. III 1991), named it New Bank of New\n\nEngland  (NBNE),  and  assigned  the leasehold  interest  in  the\n\nHyannis property to it.  See 12 U.S.C.   1821(n)(3)(A) (Supp. III\n                            \n\n1991).  When appellant, relying on the lease's terms, served NBNE\n\nwith a notice to quit, the bank stood fast, asserting that FIRREA\n\nrendered the ipso facto clause unenforceable.\n                       \n\n          Appellant  then  sought  a  declaration  of  rights  in\n\nfederal  district court, naming NBNE and FDIC as defendants.3  He\n\nargued  that section  1821(e)(12)(A)  should only  be applied  to\n\nleases executed  after FIRREA's  effective date.   In appellant's\n\nview, applying the statute to  a preexisting lease containing  an\n\nipso  facto clause  effectively nullifies  the clause,  therefore\n           \n\nconstituting an improper retroactive  application of the statute;\n\nand, moreover, effects a taking without compensation in violation\n\nof the Fifth Amendment.\n\n          The  district court  rejected these  twin asseverations\n\nand granted summary judgment in defendants' favor.

We do not agree.\n\n          The determination of whether a statute's application in\n\na particular situation is prospective or retroactive depends upon\n\nwhether  the  conduct  that   allegedly  triggers  the  statute's\n\napplication  occurs before  or  after the  law's effective  date.\n\nHence, a statute's application is usually deemed prospective when\n\nit implicates conduct  occurring on or after  the effective date.\n\nSee Cox v.

Phrased another way, a statute\n\ndoes  not operate  retroactively simply  because its  application\n\nrequires some reference to  antecedent facts.  See Cox,  260 U.S.\n                                                      \n\nat 435; see also New Orleans Pub.

So long as\n\na neoteric law determines status solely for the purpose of future\n\nmatters, its application is deemed prospective.  See New  Orleans\n                                                                 \n\nPub. Serv., 826 F.2d at 365.\n          \n\n          Employing  these first  principles,  FIRREA's reach  in\n\nthis  case  cannot  be  deemed  retroactive.    Signing  a  lease\n\ncontaining  an  ipso  facto  clause does  not  in  itself unleash\n                           \n\nsection  1821(e)(12)(A).   Only  subsequent events  can pull  the\n\ntrigger.  Here, for example, FIRREA was brought into play through\n\na  collocation of  circumstances,  all occurring  well after  the\n\n                                6\n\nlaw's  effective  date:    the tenant's  insolvency,  the  FDIC's\n\nappointment as  receiver, and  the landlord's attempt  to utilize\n\nthe lease's escape hatch.   It follows that, because  the conduct\n\ntriggering the statute's application occurred long after FIRREA's\n\nenactment, using section 1821(e) to  trump the ipso facto  clause\n                                                         \n\nconstitutes a prospective use  of the statute regardless of  when\n\nthe lease was executed.4   Any other result would  twist FIRREA's\n\nstructure,  do violence  to  its clear  language, and  needlessly\n\nfrustrate Congress's  intent to  \"deal expeditiously  with failed\n\nfinancial  institutions.\"   H.R.

There, the court applied section 1821(e)(12)(A) to render\n\nunenforceable a lease  termination clause similar  to the one  at\n\nissue  here.   See id.  at 426-27.

He still  enjoys  all  other\n\ncommon-law rights particular to  lessors; all other provisions in\n\nthe lease, including those that allow appellant  to terminate the\n\nlease for, say,  breach of the agreement to pay  rent in a timely\n\nfashion or breach  of the  covenant to maintain  the premises  in\n\ngood  order, remain in  full force.   FIRREA's application, then,\n\ncan  hardly be  said to  deprive appellant  of anything  remotely\n\nresembling his entire bundle of rights.\n\n          What is  more, the present tenant,  as FDIC's assignee,\n\nis not  a free rider.   It  must use  the premises  only for  the\n\npurposes permitted in  the lease, abide by the lease's covenants,\n\nand  pay the rent and  other emoluments stipulated  in the lease.\n\nThus,  the  only  economic harm  that  befalls  appellant  from a\n\nfrustration  of the  ipso facto  clause is  whatever anticipatory\n                               \n\nharm  may stem from his  lost opportunity to  re-rent the Hyannis\n\nproperty at a  potentially more  lucrative rate.   Such a  \"loss\"\n\ndoes not weigh heavily in the constitutional balance.

In   the  circumstances  of  this  case,\n\nextinguishing  appellant's  preexisting  right  to  terminate the\n\nlease  upon the  bank  tenant's failure  creates  only a  minimal\n\nimpairment of appellant's overall rights in the Hyannis property.\n\n          The second significant factor in determining whether  a\n\n                                12\n\nregulation constitutes  a Fifth  Amendment taking  implicates the\n\nextent  of the interference  with investment-backed expectations.\n\nThe  inquiry  into  this  factor further  undermines  appellant's\n\nposition.\n\n          Although  prudent landlords pepper leases with a myriad\n\nof provisions designed to guard against worst-case contingencies,\n\nlandlords  nevertheless lease  property in  the expectation  that\n\nthey  will receive  the agreed-upon  rent, not  in the  hope that\n\nadverse  contingencies will  materialize  and  bring  contractual\n\nsafeguards  into  play.    Moreover,  considering  the  pervasive\n\nregulation that has long characterized the banking industry, see,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  Fahey v.

Those who  deal with firms\n\nin regulated industries must expect that their dealings will from\n\ntime  to time  be affected by  statutory and  regulatory changes.\n\nSee Connolly, 475 U.S. at 227.\n            \n\n          Given  that  the  reasonable  expectation  to  which  a\n\nlandlord  is entitled is an  uninterrupted stream of  rent at the\n\ncontract  rate, not  the future  exercise of  a termination-upon-\n\ninsolvency clause,  FIRREA cannot be viewed as interfering with a\n\nvested property  interest, the usurpation of  which would require\n\ncompensation.  See Penn Cent., 438 U.S. at 124-25 (observing that\n                             \n\n                                13\n\ngovernment  actions, even  those which  \"cause[] economic  harm,\"\n\ncannot be  considered takings  when they  do not  \"interfere with\n\ninterests that  [are] sufficiently  bound up with  the reasonable\n\nexpectations of  the claimant to constitute  `property' for Fifth\n\nAmendment  purposes\").    In  the last  analysis,  FIRREA  leaves\n\nappellant firmly in possession  of the essence of that  for which\n\nhe bargained:  a fixed rent for a fixed period.\n\n          Turning to the third  factor, we do not think  that the\n\ngovernmental action here at  issue resembles a physical invasion.\n\nThe government, through FIRREA, is  not appropriating appellant's\n\nproperty for its  own use.   Rather,  it is  altering the  future\n\noperation  of  landlords'  and tenants'  preexisting  contractual\n\nrights in order to stem the disruption of banking services within\n\ncommunities, lessen  the costs  of bank liquidation,  and restore\n\npublic confidence  in the  nation's banking  system.   In  short,\n\nFIRREA's role here is  to reallocate economic pluses  and minuses\n\nin what  we find to be  an apt illustration of  the aphorism that\n\n\"Congress  routinely  creates  burdens  for  some  that  directly\n\nbenefit others.\"   Connolly, 475 U.S.  at 223.  There  is nothing\n                           \n\nwrong  per se with such  expressions of legislative  will or with\n             \n\nthe readjustments that they produce.\n\n          In a nutshell, the character of the governmental action\n\nstrongly favors  the  appellees' position.   The  mere fact  that\n\nfuture  obeisance to the newly enacted law might cause a property\n\nowner, as  in this case, to  forgo an opportunity for  gain is no\n\nmore than a necessary  consequence of FIRREA's regulatory regime.\n\n                                14\n\nHence, if there is  an invasion of a property right at all, it is\n\na  tiny invasion  of  a lambent  right,  arising \"from  a  public\n\nprogram that adjusts the benefits and burdens of economic life to\n\npromote  the common  good,\" id.  at 225, and,  as such,  does not\n                               \n\nconstitute a  taking.
