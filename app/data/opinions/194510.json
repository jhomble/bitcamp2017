Defendant-appellant Alexander\n                            \n\nC. Nazzaro challenges his  conviction for violating 18 U.S.C.\n\n   922(g)(1), which makes it unlawful for any person \"who has\n\nbeen  convicted  in  any  court  of  a  crime  punishable  by\n\nimprisonment for a  term exceeding one  year . .  . to . .  .\n\npossess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition .\n\n. .  \"   Although  we affirm  the conviction,  we  do so  for\n\nreasons different from those asserted by the district court.\n\n                              I.\n\n                      Prior Proceedings\n                                       \n\n        The relevant facts  of this case are undisputed.   On\n\nMarch 12,  1990, agents from  the Federal Bureau  of Alcohol,\n\nTobacco and  Firearms (BATF), Massachusetts State  Police and\n\nBarnstable  (Mass.)  Police  Department  executed  a  federal\n\nsearch  warrant at  the Hyannis  home of  defendant's mother,\n\nwhere defendant resided. The search yielded five firearms.1\n\n        Nazzaro's subsequent indictment was predicated on the\n\nfollowing Massachusetts state court convictions, all of which\n\nwere punishable by imprisonment for more than one year:\n\n        1.   Assault  and  battery;  Chelsea District  Court;\n        February 1977;\n\n        2.   Rape  and assault  and battery with  a dangerous\n        weapon; Suffolk Superior Court; December 1977;\n\n                    \n\n1.  The firearms at  issue were two shotguns, two  rifles and\none pistol.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n        3.   Assault  and  battery;  Essex   Superior  Court;\nOctober      1978.2\n\n          The  case was submitted to  a bench trial, prior to\n\nwhich both sides stipulated  to defendant's possession of the\n\nfive  firearms listed  in  the indictment  and  to his  prior\n\nconvictions.    In  addition,  the  parties  stipulated  that\n\nNazzaro, at  the  time  of  his  arrest,  possessed  a  valid\n\nMassachusetts  Firearms Identification  Card (FID),  by which\n\nthe Commonwealth authorized  him to possess  in his home  the\n\nfirearms at issue.  See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 140,   129B.3\n                       \n\n        Thus,  the sole issue before the  trial judge was the\n\nefficacy  of Nazzaro's  defense,  in which  he sought  refuge\n\n                    \n\n2.  Under Massachusetts law, only the December 1977, rape and\nassault  and battery  with a  dangerous weapon  convictions--\nnumber two,  above--are considered felonies.   See Mass. Gen.\n                                                  \nL. ch.  265,   13A; Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  274,   1.   While the\nother convictions  are misdemeanors under  Massachusetts law,\n18 U.S.C.    921(a)(20)(B) provides that  a state misdemeanor\nis considered a  \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term\nexceeding  one year\"  if it  is punishable  by more  than two\nyears  imprisonment.   Under Massachusetts  law, assault  and\nbattery is punishable  by a maximum term of two  and one half\nyears, thus  bringing the  two state misdemeanors  within the\npurview of section 922(g)(1).\n\n3.  Nazzaro received his FID in October 1977, after his first\nmisdemeanor conviction, but prior to his  felony convictions.\nUnder  Mass.  Gen.  L.  ch.  140,     129B,  the  misdemeanor\nconviction had no legal  effect on his ability to  obtain the\nFID, but it could have been revoked by the issuing authority-\n-the   Barnstable   Police   Department--after   the   felony\nconvictions. For  reasons unknown, however,  revocation never\noccurred.   In addition, the  same statute prohibits  a felon\nfrom  obtaining  a FID  within  five years  of  conviction or\nrelease  from jail.  There  is no dispute  that the five-year\nfirearm  proscription had  expired by  the time  of Nazzaro's\nfederal arrest and prosecution.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nunder the portion  of 18 U.S.C.    921(a)(20) which  provides\n\nthat:\n\n             Any   conviction  which   has  been\n             expunged, or set aside or for which\n             a person has  been pardoned or  has\n             had civil rights restored shall not\n             be  considered   a  conviction  for\n             purposes  of  this chapter,  unless\n             such   pardon,    expungement,   or\n             restoration    of   civil    rights\n             expressly provides  that the person\n             may  not ship,  transport, possess,\n             or receive firearms.\n\nNazzaro argued that the provisions of Mass Gen. L. ch. 140,  \n\n129B which allow a convicted felon to obtain a FID five years\n\nafter  conviction or release from jail, and thereby possess a\n\nfirearm  at   home,  when  taken  in   conjunction  with  his\n\npossession of a valid  FID and the failure of  authorities to\n\nrevoke  same, constituted  a  \"restoration  of civil  rights\"\n\nwithin the meaning of 18 U.S.C.   921(a)(20), thus taking his\n\nconvictions for rape and assault and battery with a dangerous\n\nweapons--the  Massachusetts felonies--  outside the  reach of\n\nfederal firearms law.  The trial court disagreed, ruling that\n\nbecause possession of  a firearm  is not a  \"civil right\"  in\n\nMassachusetts, defendant's possession of the FID and right to\n\npossess   the  firearms   at   issue   cannot  constitute   a\n\n\"restoration of civil rights.\"  United States v. Nazzaro, 778\n                                                        \n\nF. Supp. 1, 2 (D. Mass. 1991).\n\n                             II.\n\n                          Discussion\n                                    \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n        We  review de  novo  the district  court's ruling  on\n                           \n\nNazzaro's status.   United States v. Chambers, 964  F.2d 1250\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir. 1992); See United States v. Haynes, 961 F.2d 50, 51\n                                            \n\n(4th Cir.  1992) (issue of whether defendant  was a convicted\n\nfelon  within the  meaning  of 18  U.S.C.     921(a)(20)  and\n\n922(g)(1) involves  a purely legal determination).   As noted\n\nabove, we  affirm Nazzaro's conviction.   A brief explanation\n\nof our reasoning follows.\n\n        As appellant's  counsel essentially conceded  at oral\n\nargument, a  panel of this  court recently--and  explicitly--\n\nblocked the way  to Nazzaro's putative safe haven.  In United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. Ramos, 961 F.2d 1003 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 113\n                                                        \n\nS. Ct. 364 (1992), we were presented with, as we  are here, a\n\nfederal \"felon-in-possession\" defendant among whose predicate\n\ncrimes   were  those   categorized   as  misdemeanors   under\n\nMassachusetts law.  We concluded that\n\n             an individual convicted of  a crime\n             categorized as  a misdemeanor under\n             Massachusetts law,  . . .  does not\n             by  law  forfeit any  civil rights.\n             Hence, the proper  inquiry here  is\n             whether an individual residing in a\n             jurisdiction  which does  not strip\n             him or her of any civil rights as a\n             collateral      consequence      of\n             conviction  should  be  deemed,  as\n             appellant  urges,  to have  had his\n             civil    rights   \"restored\"    for\n             purposes  of      922(a)(1),  after\n             having  served  his/her   sentence.\n             Like the district court, we believe\n             the answer is no.\n\nId. at 1008.\n   \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n        As appellant's counsel  recognized, this  case is  on\n\nall  fours  with  Ramos  vis-a-vis  appellant's Massachusetts\n                       \n\nmisdemeanor convictions.4  Nazzaro, like Ramos, was  stripped\n\nof  no  civil   rights  as  a   result  of  his   misdemeanor\n\nconvictions. Thus, according to Ramos, Nazzaro could not have\n                                     \n\nhad  any such  rights  \"restored\" within  the  meaning of  18\n\nU.S.C.    921(a)(20).    Bound  as  we  are  by  prior  panel\n\ndecisions  so  closely on  point,  Fournier  v. Best  Western\n                                                             \n\nTreasure Island Resort, 962  F.2d 126, 127 (1st. Cir.  1992),\n                      \n\nwe find, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.    922(g)(1), that appellant's\n\nprior misdemeanors are \"crimes punishable by imprisonment for\n\naterm exceedingoneyear.\"Accordingly,hisconvictionisaffirmed.5\n                                                   affirmed\n\n                    \n\n4.  We  note that  the  potential legal  effect of  Nazzaro's\nMassachusetts  misdemeanor  convictions  was not  extensively\nargued before, nor relied on by, the trial court, and that we\nrendered   our  decision   in  Ramos   subsequent  to   those\n                                    \nproceedings.    However,   the  parties  stipulated   to  the\nexistence of those  convictions, and where the key  facts are\nundisputed,  we may  affirm  the district  court by  grouping\nthose facts  \"`along the [proper] matrix.'\"  Unites States v.\n                                                          \nNivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1127  (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting  United\n                                                             \nStates v. Mora,  821 F.2d  860, 869 (1st  Cir. 1987)),  cert.\n                                                             \ndenied,  110 S. Ct.  1300 (1990). Thus, we  rely on Ramos, as\n                                                         \nexplained more fully, infra, n. 5.\n                           \n\n5.  We  choose here to rely on Ramos rather than the district\n                                    \ncourt's \"civil rights\"  analysis for two reasons.   First, as\nillustrated above,  Ramos is indistinguishable from  the case\n                         \nat bar, and thus  provides the most direct resolution  to the\nissue  on appeal.   Second, we  are not  entirely comfortable\nwith the  district court's analysis of  the interplay between\n18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1) and 18 U.S.C.   921(a)(20). \n        Our concern stems  from the fact that  no other court\nthat  has  examined this  oft-contested  issue  has used  the\ncriterion of whether the state considers firearm ownership to\nbe  a civil right as a ratio decidendi.  Instead, many courts\n                                      \nhave used  a dual inquiry, initially  determining whether the\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n                    \n\nfelon's \"political\" civil rights--to  vote, hold office,  sit\non  a  jury, etc.--have  been  restored,  and then  examining\nwhether  and to  what  extent such  restoration curtails  his\nfirearm  privileges as  a  result of  his felon  status. See,\n                                                            \ne.g.,  United States  v. Driscoll,  970  F.2d 1472  (6th Cir.\n                                 \n1992), cert. denied,  61 U.S.L.W. 3498  (U.S. Jan. 13,  1993)\n                   \n(No. 92-6132); United States v.  Cardwell, 967 F.2d 1349 (9th\n                                         \nCir.  1992); United States v.  Dahms, 938 F.2d  131 (9th Cir.\n                                    \n1991); United States v. Traxel, 914 F.2d 119 (8th Cir. 1990);\n                              \nUnited  States v. Gomez, 911 F.2d 219 (9th Cir. 1990); United\n                                                             \nStates  v. Cassidy,  899  F.2d 543  (6th  Cir. 1990);  United\n                                                             \nStates v. Coffman,  761 F.  Supp. 1493 (D.  Kan. 1991).  This\n                 \nmethod of analysis seems most consistent with the language of\nsection 921(a)(20) wherein the civil  rights restoration does\nnot save a defendant  if such restoration \"expressly provides\nthat the person may not  ship, transport, possess, or receive\nfirearms.\"\n        The district court relied  on United States v. Erwin,\n                                                            \n723 F. Supp. 1285 (C.D. Ill. 1989), aff'd,  902 F.2d 510 (7th\n                                         \nCir.),  cert.  denied, 111  S.  Ct.  161 (1991),  which  does\n                     \nquestion whether  firearm ownership itself is  a civil right.\nHowever,  that  court's  affirmative   answer  was  not   the\ndeterminative factor in its final decision.\n        Finally,  we note  that  while Ramos  held that  some\n                                            \naffirmative state  action is required to  \"restore\" a felon's\ncivil   rights,  that   case  dealt   with  a   Massachusetts\nmisdemeanant  who  never had  any  rights taken  away.   This\ncircuit  has yet  to decide  what constitutes  an affirmative\nrestoration, or  what quantum of  rights need be  restored to\nsatisfy 18 U.S.C.   921(a)(20). Because  we base our decision\ntoday on Nazzaro's prior  Massachusetts misdemeanors, we need\nnot  address  the  impact  of  Nazzaro's  prior Massachusetts\nfelonies. \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n",

Defendant-appellant Alexander\n                            \n\nC. Nazzaro challenges his  conviction for violating 18 U.S.C.\n\n   922(g)(1), which makes it unlawful for any person \"who has\n\nbeen  convicted  in  any  court  of  a  crime  punishable  by\n\nimprisonment for a  term exceeding one  year . .  . to . .  .\n\npossess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition .\n\n. .  \"   Although  we affirm  the conviction,  we  do so  for\n\nreasons different from those asserted by the district court.\n\n                              I.\n\n                      Prior Proceedings\n                                       \n\n        The relevant facts  of this case are undisputed.   On\n\nMarch 12,  1990, agents from  the Federal Bureau  of Alcohol,\n\nTobacco and  Firearms (BATF), Massachusetts State  Police and\n\nBarnstable  (Mass.)  Police  Department  executed  a  federal\n\nsearch  warrant at  the Hyannis  home of  defendant's mother,\n\nwhere defendant resided. The search yielded five firearms.1\n\n        Nazzaro's subsequent indictment was predicated on the\n\nfollowing Massachusetts state court convictions, all of which\n\nwere punishable by imprisonment for more than one year:\n\n        1.   Assault  and  battery;  Chelsea District  Court;\n        February 1977;\n\n        2.   Rape  and assault  and battery with  a dangerous\n        weapon; Suffolk Superior Court; December 1977;\n\n                    \n\n1.  The firearms at  issue were two shotguns, two  rifles and\none pistol.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n        3.   Assault  and  battery;  Essex   Superior  Court;\nOctober      1978.2\n\n          The  case was submitted to  a bench trial, prior to\n\nwhich both sides stipulated  to defendant's possession of the\n\nfive  firearms listed  in  the indictment  and  to his  prior\n\nconvictions.    In  addition,  the  parties  stipulated  that\n\nNazzaro, at  the  time  of  his  arrest,  possessed  a  valid\n\nMassachusetts  Firearms Identification  Card (FID),  by which\n\nthe Commonwealth authorized  him to possess  in his home  the\n\nfirearms at issue.  See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 140,   129B.3\n                       \n\n        Thus,  the sole issue before the  trial judge was the\n\nefficacy  of Nazzaro's  defense,  in which  he sought  refuge\n\n                    \n\n2.  Under Massachusetts law, only the December 1977, rape and\nassault  and battery  with a  dangerous weapon  convictions--\nnumber two,  above--are considered felonies.   See Mass. Gen.\n                                                  \nL. ch.  265,   13A; Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  274,   1.   While the\nother convictions  are misdemeanors under  Massachusetts law,\n18 U.S.C.    921(a)(20)(B) provides that  a state misdemeanor\nis considered a  \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term\nexceeding  one year\"  if it  is punishable  by more  than two\nyears  imprisonment.   Under Massachusetts  law, assault  and\nbattery is punishable  by a maximum term of two  and one half\nyears, thus  bringing the  two state misdemeanors  within the\npurview of section 922(g)(1).\n\n3.  Nazzaro received his FID in October 1977, after his first\nmisdemeanor conviction, but prior to his  felony convictions.\nUnder  Mass.  Gen.  L.  ch.  140,     129B,  the  misdemeanor\nconviction had no legal  effect on his ability to  obtain the\nFID, but it could have been revoked by the issuing authority-\n-the   Barnstable   Police   Department--after   the   felony\nconvictions. For  reasons unknown, however,  revocation never\noccurred.   In addition, the  same statute prohibits  a felon\nfrom  obtaining  a FID  within  five years  of  conviction or\nrelease  from jail.  There  is no dispute  that the five-year\nfirearm  proscription had  expired by  the time  of Nazzaro's\nfederal arrest and prosecution.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nunder the portion  of 18 U.S.C.    921(a)(20) which  provides\n\nthat:\n\n             Any   conviction  which   has  been\n             expunged, or set aside or for which\n             a person has  been pardoned or  has\n             had civil rights restored shall not\n             be  considered   a  conviction  for\n             purposes  of  this chapter,  unless\n             such   pardon,    expungement,   or\n             restoration    of   civil    rights\n             expressly provides  that the person\n             may  not ship,  transport, possess,\n             or receive firearms.\n\nNazzaro argued that the provisions of Mass Gen. L. ch. 140,  \n\n129B which allow a convicted felon to obtain a FID five years\n\nafter  conviction or release from jail, and thereby possess a\n\nfirearm  at   home,  when  taken  in   conjunction  with  his\n\npossession of a valid  FID and the failure of  authorities to\n\nrevoke  same, constituted  a  \"restoration  of civil  rights\"\n\nwithin the meaning of 18 U.S.C.   921(a)(20), thus taking his\n\nconvictions for rape and assault and battery with a dangerous\n\nweapons--the  Massachusetts felonies--  outside the  reach of\n\nfederal firearms law.  The trial court disagreed, ruling that\n\nbecause possession of  a firearm  is not a  \"civil right\"  in\n\nMassachusetts, defendant's possession of the FID and right to\n\npossess   the  firearms   at   issue   cannot  constitute   a\n\n\"restoration of civil rights.\"  United States v.

We concluded that\n\n             an individual convicted of  a crime\n             categorized as  a misdemeanor under\n             Massachusetts law,  . . .  does not\n             by  law  forfeit any  civil rights.\n             Hence, the proper  inquiry here  is\n             whether an individual residing in a\n             jurisdiction  which does  not strip\n             him or her of any civil rights as a\n             collateral      consequence      of\n             conviction  should  be  deemed,  as\n             appellant  urges,  to have  had his\n             civil    rights   \"restored\"    for\n             purposes  of      922(a)(1),  after\n             having  served  his/her   sentence.\n             Like the district court, we believe\n             the answer is no.\n\nId. at 1008.\n   \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n        As appellant's counsel  recognized, this  case is  on\n\nall  fours  with  Ramos  vis-a-vis  appellant's Massachusetts\n                       \n\nmisdemeanor convictions.4  Nazzaro, like Ramos, was  stripped\n\nof  no  civil   rights  as  a   result  of  his   misdemeanor\n\nconvictions. Thus, according to Ramos, Nazzaro could not have\n                                     \n\nhad  any such  rights  \"restored\" within  the  meaning of  18\n\nU.S.C.    921(a)(20).

We  choose here to rely on Ramos rather than the district\n                                    \ncourt's \"civil rights\"  analysis for two reasons.   First, as\nillustrated above,  Ramos is indistinguishable from  the case\n                         \nat bar, and thus  provides the most direct resolution  to the\nissue  on appeal.   Second, we  are not  entirely comfortable\nwith the  district court's analysis of  the interplay between\n18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1) and 18 U.S.C.   921(a)(20). \n        Our concern stems  from the fact that  no other court\nthat  has  examined this  oft-contested  issue  has used  the\ncriterion of whether the state considers firearm ownership to\nbe  a civil right as a ratio decidendi.  Instead, many courts\n                                      \nhave used  a dual inquiry, initially  determining whether the\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n                    \n\nfelon's \"political\" civil rights--to  vote, hold office,  sit\non  a  jury, etc.--have  been  restored,  and then  examining\nwhether  and to  what  extent such  restoration curtails  his\nfirearm  privileges as  a  result of  his felon  status.

Coffman,  761 F.  Supp. 1493 (D.  Kan. 1991).  This\n                 \nmethod of analysis seems most consistent with the language of\nsection 921(a)(20) wherein the civil  rights restoration does\nnot save a defendant  if such restoration \"expressly provides\nthat the person may not  ship, transport, possess, or receive\nfirearms.\"\n        The district court relied  on United States v.

Ct.  161 (1991),  which  does\n                     \nquestion whether  firearm ownership itself is  a civil right.\nHowever,  that  court's  affirmative   answer  was  not   the\ndeterminative factor in its final decision.\n        Finally,  we note  that  while Ramos  held that  some\n                                            \naffirmative state  action is required to  \"restore\" a felon's\ncivil   rights,  that   case  dealt   with  a   Massachusetts\nmisdemeanant  who  never had  any  rights taken  away.   This\ncircuit  has yet  to decide  what constitutes  an affirmative\nrestoration, or  what quantum of  rights need be  restored to\nsatisfy 18 U.S.C.   921(a)(20).
