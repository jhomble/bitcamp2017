Because\n\npetitioners   cannot   satisfy  the   strict   prerequisites  for\n\nextraordinary relief by way of mandamus, we dismiss the petition.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          The United  States District  Court for the  District of\n\nMassachusetts  has been  involved with  the Treatment  Center for\n\nmore  than two decades.   In 1974,  the district court  entered a\n\nconsent decree  and supplemental  consent decree  in the case  of\n\nKing  v. Greenblatt.1   The decrees  placed the  Treatment Center\n                   \n\nunder the  primary authority  of the Massachusetts  Department of\n\nMental  Health  and  obligated  the  department  to  operate  the\n\nfacility  in accordance  with  certain standards.   The  district\n\ncourt specifically retained  the right to amend  the King decrees\n                                                         \n\nin the future.\n\n          Although  the original  plaintiff, King, soon  left the\n\nTreatment  Center, other  residents  took up  the cudgels.   Over\n\ntime,  inmates brought a variety of suits to enforce the decrees.\n\n                    \n\n     1King, an  individual  confined  at  the  Treatment  Center,\nbrought  suit,  inter  alia,  to   reform  certain  institutional\n                           \npolicies and  practices.  Relevant  portions of the  original and\nsupplemental consent decrees are  set forth as appendices  in two\nearlier decisions  of this court.  See  Pearson v. Fair, 935 F.2d\n                                                       \n401,  416-19 (1st Cir. 1991); Langton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d 1206,\n                                                 \n1227-28 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                                2\n\nThe  stream of  litigation occasionally  overflowed the  district\n\ncourt.   See, e.g., Pearson v. Fair, 935 F.2d 401 (1st Cir. 1991)\n                                   \n\n(Pearson II); Langton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d 1206 (1st Cir. 1991);\n                                 \n\nPearson  v. Fair,  808  F.2d 163  (1st  Cir. 1986)  (per  curiam)\n                \n\n(Pearson  I).    The  petitioners, all  of  whom  were originally\n           \n\ninmates of  the Treatment Center  and at least one  of whom still\n\nresides there,  have been at the eye of the  storm.  In the early\n\n1980s,  they brought an action  to enforce the  King decrees, see\n                                                                 \n\nPearson  I,  808  F.2d  at 165,  and  subsequently  survived  the\n          \n\nCommonwealth's challenge to their alleged lack of standing.   See\n                                                                 \n\nPearson  II,  935  F.2d at  404  n.4.    Moreover,  in 1988,  the\n           \n\npetitioners intervened  in  the  King  case and  fended  off  the\n                                     \n\nCommonwealth's motion to vacate the judgment therein.\n\n          The continuing  saga of the federal courts' involvement\n\nwith  the Treatment  Center  took a  new  turn in  1992  when the\n\ndistrict  court,  acting  on   its  own  initiative  and  without\n\nproviding advance  notice, appointed a special  master to analyze\n\n\"the impact  of existing and  pending legislation on  the consent\n\ndecrees\" and on \"the operation of the Treatment Center\"; to study\n\nall unresolved claims alleging violations of the consent decrees;\n\nand  to  advise  the  court  concerning  the  Treatment  Center's\n\noperation and the continued viability of the King decrees.2\n                                                 \n\n          The petitioners  learned of  this initiative  after the\n\nfact.  They  did not take kindly to it.   When the district court\n\n                    \n\n     2The district  court's order is reproduced  in the appendix.\nWe omit therefrom the master's curriculum vitae.\n\n                                3\n\nrefused to alter its stance, the petitioners headed for the court\n\nof appeals.  In this forum, they ask for mandamus, asserting that\n\nthe  lower court lacked jurisdiction to  appoint a master because\n\nKing was dead,  juridically if not literally, and because neither\n    \n\nside was currently seeking,  or had recently sought, modification\n\nof the  King decrees.   Petitioners also assert  a host  of other\n            \n\nchallenges to the entry of the order and to its scope.\n\nII.  THE USES OF MANDAMUS\n\n          Congress  has authorized  the federal  courts to  issue\n\nprerogative writs  which are \"necessary or appropriate  in aid of\n\ntheir respective jurisdictions.\"  28 U.S.C.   1651(a) (1988).  As\n\nthe Court recently reminded us, a traditional use  of prerogative\n\nwrits  has been to confine inferior courts to the lawful exercise\n\nof their prescribed jurisdiction or compel them to exercise their\n\nauthority  when duty demands.  See Mallard v. United States Dist.\n                                                                 \n\nCourt, 490 U.S. 296, 308 (1989) (quoting Roche v. Evaporated Milk\n                                                                 \n\nAss'n,  319 U.S.  21,  26  (1943)).    This  use  is  customarily\n     \n\naccomplished by means of mandamus  or prohibition (terms which we\n\nemploy  interchangeably in  this opinion).   Such writs  afford a\n\nmechanism for immediate correction of acts or omissions amounting\n\nto an \"usurpation of power.\"   De Beers Consolid. Mines, Ltd.  v.\n                                                             \n\nUnited States, 325 U.S. 212, 217 (1945).\n             \n\n          Prerogative writs  are drastic remedies which  have the\n\npotential, if overexercised,  \"to spawn piecemeal litigation  and\n\ndisrupt  the orderly  processes of  the justice  system.\"   In re\n                                                                 \n\nRecticel  Foam Corp., 859 F.2d 1000, 1005 (1st Cir. 1988).  Thus,\n                    \n\n                                4\n\nmandamus  must  be  used  sparingly  and  only  in  extraordinary\n\nsituations.   See Allied Chem.  Corp. v. Daiflon,  Inc., 449 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n33, 34 (1980) (per curiam);  Will v. United States, 389 U.S.  90,\n                                                  \n\n107 (1967); In re Insurers Syndicate, 864 F.2d 208, 211 (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1988); see  also Boreri v. Fiat S.p.A., 763 F.2d 17, 26 (1st Cir.\n                                      \n\n1985) (warning that the  writ's \"currency is not profligately  to\n\nbe spent\").\n\n          To  ensure   that  the  writ's  use   is  appropriately\n\nrationed,  we have,  for the  most part,3  insisted that  a writ-\n\nseeker  limn \"some  special risk  of irreparable  harm,\" together\n\nwith \"clear entitlement to the  relief requested.\"  Recticel, 859\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 1005;  accord In re Bushkin Assocs.,  Inc., 864 F.2d 241,\n                                                  \n\n243  (1st Cir.  1989); In  re Justices  of the  Supreme  Court of\n                                                                 \n\nPuerto  Rico, 695 F.2d  17, 20 (1st  Cir. 1982).4   On the former\n            \n\nprong, the petitioner \"must ordinarily demonstrate that something\n\n                    \n\n     3We qualify our statement because there are infrequent cases\nin which the usual requirements may be relaxed.  See, e.g., In re\n                                                                 \nJustices  of the  Supreme Court of  Puerto Rico, 695  F.2d 17, 25\n                                               \n(1st Cir. 1982); see  also In re Ellsberg,  446 F.2d 954,  956-57\n                                         \n(1st Cir. 1971).   Such cases invariably involve issues  of great\npublic  import,  justifying resort  to  advisory  mandamus.   See\n                                                                 \ngenerally Recticel,  859 F.2d  at 1005  n.4 (describing  types of\n                  \ncases  in  which  advisory  mandamus  may   be  suitable).    The\npetitioners  do not  suggest,  and we  cannot conclude,  that the\nmatters implicated here fall into that category.\n\n     4In  one  sense,  the  \"clear  entitlement\"  language  is  a\nmisnomer.   It  seems more  accurate to  say that  a petitioner's\nentitlement  to the writ depends on a two-tiered showing that the\ndistrict court's order (a) presents a special risk of significant\nirreparable harm  and (b) is palpably  erroneous.  See La  Buy v.\n                                                              \nHowes  Leather Co., 352 U.S. 249, 256  (1957).  We use the phrase\n                  \n\"palpably erroneous\" to signify a situation in which  the claimed\nvice  is plain  as  a matter  of  law and  is  also substantially\nprejudicial as a matter of fact.\n\n                                5\n\nabout the order, or its circumstances, would make an  end-of-case\n\nappeal ineffectual or leave legitimate interests unduly at risk.\"\n\nRecticel, 859  F.2d at 1005-06;  accord United States  v. Sorren,\n                                                                \n\n605 F.2d  1211, 1215 (1st Cir.  1979).  On the  latter prong, the\n\npetitioner  must usually  establish  a \"clear  and  indisputable\"\n\nright  to  the  requested relief,  Bankers  Life  &amp;  Cas.

See supra note 4.   This\n                                                  \n\ndichotomous    standard    is    sufficiently   stringent    that\n\n\"[i]nterlocutory  procedural orders  .  . .  rarely will  satisfy\n\nth[e]  precondition for mandamus relief.\"   Recticel, 859 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n1006.  Nonetheless,  a district court's  appointment of a  master\n\nmay be  so far afield, and the potential for mischief so great in\n\na particular  situation, that immediate relief by way of mandamus\n\nis  warranted.  See, e.g., La Buy  v. Howes Leather Co., 352 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n249, 256 (1957); National  Org. for the Reform of  Marijuana Laws\n                                                                 \n\n(NORML) v. Mullen, 828 F.2d 536, 541-42 (9th Cir. 1987).\n                 \n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\n          Because  petitioners'   variegated  challenges  reflect\n\nneither a  special risk of  significant harm  nor palpable  error\n\nattributable to the judge's  interlocutory order, mandamus is not\n\njustified.   For ease in presentation, we discuss these points in\n\nreverse order.\n\n                 A.  Presence of Palpable Error.\n                                               \n\n          The  petitioners have  failed  to demonstrate  that the\n\n                                6\n\ndistrict court lapsed into palpable error or, stated another way,\n\nthat  they  are clearly  entitled to  the  relief requested.   To\n\nexplain why  this is so,  we deal  extensively with  petitioners'\n\nmain \"case or controversy\" approach and then consider their other\n\nasseverations in a group.\n\n          1.  The Case  or Controversy Requirement.   Petitioners\n          1.  The Case  or Controversy Requirement.\n                                                  \n\nstrive  to convince  us  that, at  the  time the  district  court\n\nappointed the master, no justiciable case or controversy existed;\n\nand that,  therefore, the  court's order plainly  outstripped its\n\njurisdiction.  Petitioners' exhortation has two strands.  We find\n\nneither strand persuasive.\n\n                               a. \n                               a.\n                                 \n\n          The  first strand might be subtitled:  \"On the Death of\n\nKing.\"  Petitioners suggest that King was a \"dead case\" which the\n                                     \n\ndistrict  court improperly  resurrected.    Whatever this  morbid\n\nmetaphor may  mean, it misses the  mark.  The entry  of a consent\n\ndecree does not  \"kill\" a  case or terminate  a district  court's\n\njurisdiction.    Rather,  when,  as now,  an  injunction  entered\n\npursuant  to a  consent decree has  ongoing effects,  the issuing\n\ncourt retains authority to  enforce it.  See, e.g.,  System Fed'n\n                                                                 \n\nNo. 91, Etc. v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 647 (1961) (explaining that\n                      \n\nstructural injunctions \"often require[] continuing supervision by\n\nthe  issuing court and  always a continuing  willingness to apply\n\nits  powers and  processes on  behalf of  the party  who obtained\n\nth[e] equitable relief\").   By  the same token,  a court  retains\n\nauthority to modify or interpret such decrees in light of changed\n\n                                7\n\ncircumstances.   See, e.g., id. at 646-47; United States v. Swift\n                                                                 \n\n&amp;  Co., 286 U.S. 106, 114-15 (1932).  This authority is part of a\n      \n\ncourt's  inherent  powers  and  exists regardless  of  whether  a\n\nparticular  consent decree  expressly so  provides.5   See Swift,\n                                                                \n\n286 U.S. at 114; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5)-(6).\n                         \n\n          Since a  district court has  power to modify  a consent\n\ndecree, it  is impossible to say  that the court  below acted \"in\n\nclear excess\"  of its power, In  re Justices, 695 F.2d  at 21, in\n                                            \n\ntaking the much  more tentative  step of appointing  a master  to\n\ninvestigate the possibility of modifying the decree.  See Chicago\n                                                                 \n\nHousing Auth. v. Austin, 511 F.2d 82, 83 (7th Cir. 1975) (raising\n                       \n\nno question  as to  jurisdiction in such  a context).   In  other\n\nwords, nothing  about the  lower court's  raising of a  moistened\n\nfinger to test the winds implicated jurisdictional concerns.\n\n          To  be sure,  petitioners place  great emphasis  on the\n\nfact that the original plaintiff, King himself, no longer resides\n\nat  the Treatment Center.  Because  of this fact, and because the\n\nKing  case was  never certified  as a  class action,  petitioners\n    \n\ncategorize the case as defunct.   We believe this taxonomy is too\n\nsimplistic.   In the first place,  the King case is  not dead; it\n                                           \n\nis,  at worst,  moribund.   Even that  description may  be overly\n\npessimistic; petitioners  themselves became parties in  King five\n                                                            \n\nyears  ago  (when  the  district court  granted  their  motion to\n\nintervene), and their status  as parties has not been  altered by\n\n                    \n\n     5Here, of course, the district judge explicitly reserved the\npower to amend.  See Pearson I, 808 F.2d at 165.\n                              \n\n                                8\n\nany subsequent order.  In the second place, the King decrees have\n                                                    \n\nongoing  effects  and other  inmates  continue  to bring  actions\n\nseeking  their enforcement.   The  district court  obviously gave\n\nweight  to this reality, noting the \"many cases filed by patients\n\nat  the  Treatment Center.\"   Moreover,  in  opting to  appoint a\n\nmaster,  the  court made  specific  reference to  contemporaneous\n\nallegations  about institutional failings gathered by forty-eight\n\nTreatment  Center residents  desirous  of  improving their  lot.6\n\nAll things  considered, we find the tales  of King's demise to be\n                                                  \n\ngreatly exaggerated.\n\n                                b.\n                                  \n\n          The  second, more  substantial,  salvo of  petitioners'\n\njurisdictional  assault bombards the spontaneous character of the\n\ndistrict  court's action.   This  fusillade also  goes awry.   We\n\nbelieve that  a district court's jurisdiction to modify a consent\n\ndecree necessarily implies that  the court does not act  in clear\n\nexcess of its authority when it appoints a master, sua sponte, to\n                                                             \n\nlook into possible decree-modifying changes.  We explain briefly.\n\n          A consent decree is not simply a contract entered  into\n\nbetween private parties seeking to effectuate parochial concerns.\n\nSee  Firefighters v. Cleveland, 478 U.S.  501, 519 (1986); United\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     6Although these grievances were contained in a letter to the\njudge, rather  than in a lawsuit,  petitioners apparently concede\nthat  the district  court possessed the  authority to  docket the\nletter as a  pro se complaint.  We agree.   See Haines v. Kerner,\n                                                                \n404  U.S. 519,  520 (1972)  (per curiam);  Soto v.

The court  stands behind the decree, ready  to interpret\n\nand   enforce   its  provisions.      This   ongoing  supervisory\n\nresponsibility carries with it a certain  correlative discretion.\n\nSee  Wright, 364  U.S. at  648.   Unlike petitioners,  we do  not\n           \n\nenvision a  vast jurisdictional limbo  in which courts  forced to\n\nexercise their equity powers remain powerless to question whether\n\nwhat they  have  been doing  \"has  been turned  through  changing\n\ncircumstances into an instrument  of wrong.\"  Swift, 286  U.S. at\n                                                   \n\n115.

This must  mean that,  notwithstanding the\n\nparties'  silence or inertia, the district court is not doomed to\n\nsome Sisyphean  fate, bound  forever to  enforce and  interpret a\n\npreexisting  decree  without  occasionally  pausing  to  question\n\nwhether  changing   circumstances   have  rendered   the   decree\n\nunnecessary, outmoded, or even harmful to the public interest.\n\n          Against this  backdrop, the  fact that the  court acted\n\nsua sponte is not  fatal.  After all,  Fed. R. Civ. P. 53,  which\n          \n\ngoverns the appointment of masters, does not necessitate a motion\n\nas a condition  precedent to  judicial action.   Taking our  lead\n\nfrom  the rule  itself,  we hold  that  a district  court is  not\n\njurisdictionally disabled  from acting  on its own  initiative in\n\nappointing a master to  ascertain the need for alteration  of its\n\nongoing  activities under a consent  decree.7  Cf.,  e.g., INS v.\n                                                              \n\n                    \n\n     7In  its present posture, this case does not require that we\ndecide whether, or when,  a district court may actually  modify a\nconsent  decree sua  sponte.    See  Hook  v.

Here,\n\nhowever, unlike in La Buy or in Stauble v.

Hence, we cannot say, on the record\nas  it currently  stands,  that the  district  court's action  is\ntantamount to  a gratuitous modification of  the consent decrees.\nCf.  Thompson v.  Enomoto, 815  F.2d 1323,  1327 (9th  Cir. 1987)\n                         \n(ruling  that the  appointment  of a  special  master is  not  an\nimmediately appealable modification of a decree).\n\n                                12\n\nextends  beyond permissible bounds.  All that can be gleaned from\n\nthe record before us is that the district court seeks information\n\nabout the efficacy of an  ongoing injunction.  On its face,  this\n\nseems a concinnous use of a master.  See Stauble, 977 F.2d at 695\n                                                \n\n(discussing  use of  masters  in connection  with \"remedy-related\n\nissues\"); Chicago Housing Auth.,  811 F.2d at 83-84 (refusing  to\n                               \n\nannul  appointment  of  master in  analogous  circumstances); see\n                                                                 \n\ngenerally  Vincent Nathan,  The Use  of Masters  in Institutional\n                                                                 \n\nReform Litigation, 10  U.

The\n                 \n\norder's scope, as the judge has delineated it, seems more akin to\n\nrendering  \"mere assistance\" to the court, a permissible use of a\n\nmaster in many sets  of circumstances, Stauble, 977 F.2d  at 695,\n                                              \n\nthan  to abdicating adjudication of \"fundamental question[s],\" an\n\nimpermissible use  under any non-consensual set of circumstances.\n\nId.\n   \n\n                                b.\n                                  \n\n          It is  also argued  that the court's  designation of  a\n\nmaster should be obliterated because Rule 53's core requirement  \n\nthe  bedrock concept  that references are  reserved for  the rare\n\ncases which present \"some exceptional condition,\" Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n53(b)   is completely unfulfilled.  We disagree.\n\n          The  case at hand is  intricate.  Its circumstances are\n\nhighly ramified.  \"Change\" has been the  watchword virtually ever\n\nsince  the consent decrees were entered.  See, e.g., Langton, 928\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at  1209-10  &amp;  nn.  2-4  (describing  certain  changes  in\n\npertinent  legislation over  time);  id. at  1212-13  (describing\n                                        \n\n                                13\n\nsubstantial changes in facilities and conditions of confinement);\n\nid.  at   1213-16  (describing  sweeping  changes   in  treatment\n   \n\nmodalities, programs,  and  the  like).   After  two  decades  of\n\nintimate   involvement  with   an   especially   complex   public\n\ninstitution  immersed in  a state  of continuing  transition, the\n\ndistrict court is still mired in litigation.  We  think that this\n\nscenario  at least  arguably reflects  an  exceptional condition.\n\nHence, appointing  a master to survey  the legislative landscape,\n\ninvestigate the  incidence and  impact of  changed circumstances,\n\nassess  the  current relevance  of  the decrees,  and  report the\n\nresults  to  the court  did not  constitute  palpable error  as a\n\nmatter of law.  See, e.g., Chicago Housing Auth., 511 F.2d at 83-\n                                                \n\n84  (refusing to annul district  court's appointment of master in\n\nanalogous  circumstances); see  also  NORML, 828  F.2d at  543-45\n                                           \n\n(explaining  that   complexity  of  litigation  and   of  decree-\n\ncompliance can  justify appointment of a  master in institutional\n\nreform litigation); Carey, 706 F.2d at 962-63 (similar).\n                         \n\n                                c.\n                                  \n\n          Petitioners  next complain  that  some of  the  matters\n\nreferred to the master outstrip the four corners of the pleadings\n\nin King.   The short  answer to this  plaint is that  the order's\n       \n\ntext does not  bear it  out.   The slightly  longer (but  equally\n\navailing) answer  is that the litigation's  procedural posture is\n\nstill  fluid.   The  district court  has  before it  a  number of\n\ncomplaints dealing with various aspects of  life at the Treatment\n\nCenter.  The order  plainly indicates that the court  proposes to\n\n                                14\n\ntreat  these  cases  as  a  group,  at  least  for  some  (as yet\n\nundefined)  purposes.   Class certification  remains a  seemingly\n\nviable option.  To the extent  (if at all) that the court intends\n\nthe order  of reference  to extend beyond  the sequestration-type\n\nissues  originally involved in  King, we  presume that  the court\n                                    \n\nwill travel an appropriate  procedural path.  See, e.g.,  Fed. R.\n                                                       \n\nCiv.  P. 42(a)  (discussing  requirements  for  consolidation  of\n\nactions); Fed. R.  Civ.

We  see no  reason, therefore,\n\ngiven the confined office of a petition for mandamus, to stop the\n\ncourt in its tracks.\n\n                                d.\n                                  \n\n          Finally,  petitioners  claim  that  the  district court\n\nfailed to  provide them with notice before appointing the master.\n\nThey say, moreover, that  this omission was exacerbated by  an ex\n                                                                 \n\nparte  contact with respondents'  counsel (a contact  which, as a\n     \n\nbyproduct,  gave  respondents  advance  warning  of  the  judge's\n\nmindset).   We do  not believe  that, under  the totality  of the\n\ncircumstances, these facts warrant  the issuance of a prerogative\n\nwrit.\n\n          While it  seems logical  for a  trial court to  consult\n\nwith  affected parties  when contemplating  the appointment  of a\n\nmaster, the relevant procedural  rule does not explicitly require\n\nprior notice,  see Fed. R. Civ.  P. 53, and we  are unprepared to\n                  \n\nstate that advance consultation  is absolutely essential in every\n\n                                15\n\ninstance.8   Cf. Gary  W. v. Louisiana,  601 F.2d  240, 244  (5th\n                                      \n\nCir.  1979)  (holding that  a district  court  is not  obliged to\n\nconvene  an  evidentiary  hearing  anent  whether  to  appoint  a\n\nmaster).   In this context, the purpose served by prior notice is\n\nthreefold:   it permits parties to  (1) argue for or  against the\n\nvery  idea of appointing a master,  see, e.g., id. at 244-45, (2)\n                                                  \n\noffer  their  views on  the scope  of  any reference,  see, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nStauble, 977  F.2d at  694-96 (discussing  scope considerations),\n       \n\nand  (3) voice  their preferences  as to  the master's  identity.\n\nSee, e.g., Morgan v.  Kerrigan, 530 F.2d 401, 426-27  (1st Cir.),\n                              \n\ncert. denied, 426 U.S. 935 (1976).  As we have already indicated,\n            \n\nthe reasons for appointing  a master here are sensible  and self-\n\nevident; the scope of the reference is unremarkable; and, lastly,\n\nthe petitioners have neither  expressed dissatisfaction with  the\n\nindividual selected as the  master nor proffered any person  whom\n\nthey  deem a more auspicious  choice.  In  this unique situation,\n\nthe incidence of any error is problematic; and, at  any rate, the\n\nfailure to provide notice seems benign.\n\n          The  ex parte  contact  does not  stem  the tide.    It\n                       \n\nappears that the judge,  seeking to secure a commitment  from the\n\nCommonwealth to  absorb the master's  costs, directed a  clerk to\n\n                    \n\n     8Nonetheless, we  agree with the Ninth Circuit that, when an\norder  of reference is entered  sua sponte and  without notice, a\n                                          \nparty  who  considers himself  aggrieved  thereby  will be  given\nconsiderable latitude as to the form and timeliness of an ensuing\nobjection.   See Burlington N. R.R. Co. v. Department of Revenue,\n                                                                \n934 F.2d 1064, 1070-71 (9th Cir. 1991).\n\n                                16\n\ncall  the  attorney general's  department.9   We  agree  with the\n\npetitioners that even this indirect  inquiry should not have been\n\nconducted   ex  parte.    In  our   adversary  system,  both  the\n                     \n\nadministration of  justice and  the appearance of  justice demand\n\nthat  courts refrain, by  and large, from  communicating with one\n\nparty  to the  exclusion of  the other(s).   See,  e.g., Meridian\n                                                                 \n\nInt'l  Logistics, Inc. v. United  States, 939 F.2d  740, 745 (9th\n                                        \n\nCir. 1991) (stating the  familiar rule that ex parte  contacts by\n                                                    \n\nthe  judge are  not the norm);  see also  Model Code  of Judicial\n                                        \n\nConduct,  Canon  3B(7)  (1990).    Yet  in  this  instance,   the\n\ncommunication was  wholly  innocuous and  petitioners  have  been\n\nunable to suggest how the judge's lapse was harmful.  Because the\n\ncourt's  impetuosity was  in no  way prejudicial,  issuance  of a\n\nprerogative writ would be tantamount to using a bazooka to slay a\n\ngnat.   We decline  to engage  in  such judicial  overkill.   See\n                                                                 \n\nGrieco  v.  Meachum,  533  F.2d  713, 719  (1st  Cir.)

We\nconfine our  evaluation, therefore, to the  demonstrable facts of\nrecord.\n\n                                17\n\n          Although  it   may  be  unnecessary  to   do  so  given\n\npetitioners'  failure  to  show  palpable  error,  we  take  this\n\noccasion to remark that petitioners likewise flunk the first part\n\nof the conventional  mandamus test:   they offer no  satisfactory\n\nreason  to believe that they will suffer irremediable harm if the\n\nwrit does not  issue.   The order that  petitioners challenge  is\n\nmerely preliminary.  The  only thing that it accomplishes  is the\n\nappointment of a master to conduct certain studies, analyses, and\n\ninvestigations,   compile   a   report,   and   thereafter   make\n\nrecommendations to  the district judge.   We decline petitioners'\n\ninvitation to  speculate, at  this early  date, about  the purely\n\nhypothetical consequences  that may or  may not  flow from  these\n\noperose labors.10  Accord  Chicago Housing Auth., 511 F.2d  at 83\n                                                \n\n(rejecting similar challenge to similar order of reference).\n\n          Leaving rank speculation aside,  we can detect no other\n\nharm  of a kind sufficient to ground mandamus relief.  Certainly,\n\nany  increased  workload  that   may  result  from  the  master's\n\ninvolvement cannot turn the trick.  We have consistently rejected\n\nthe  general burdensomeness  of  litigation, standing  alone,  as\n\ncomprising a showing of  harm sufficient to animate the  power of\n\n                    \n\n     10Petitioners' argument  on this point is  built entirely on\nthe  fragile foundation  of conjecture  and surmise.   By  way of\nillustration, they  ruminate that,  if the master  makes findings\nconcerning,  say, the  ability of  Treatment Center  personnel to\nfunction under the King decrees, the district court may give such\n                       \nfindings  overly great  deference.   We prefer, however,  to deal\nwith  the  actuality of  a  developed  situation rather  than  to\nanticipate that a federal district court will lapse into manifest\nerror.   Cf. W. Shakespeare, Macbeth, act  I, sc. iii, ll. 133-34\n                                    \n(1605) (suggesting that, frequently, \"present fears are less than\nhorrible imaginings\").\n\n                                18\n\nmandamus.11   See, e.g.,  Recticel, 859 F.2d  at 1006 n.5;  In re\n                                                                 \n\nJustices, 695 F.2d at 20.\n        \n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go  no further.   Mandamus is an  extraordinary\n\nremedy which \"should be dispensed sparingly and only in pursuance\n\nof the  most carefully  written prescription, not  made available\n\nover  the counter, on casual demand.   It is not a substitute for\n\ninterlocutory  appeal.\"   Recticel,  859 F.2d  at  1005.   In its\n                                  \n\npresent posture, this case does not warrant a dose of such strong\n\nmedicine.   The record here  is, for the  most part, malady-free;\n\nand  any symptoms  of  arguable error,  if  later shown  to  have\n\nblossomed into full blown diseases, are amenable to a traditional\n\ncure on direct appeal.\n\n          The  petition for  mandamus  is  denied and  dismissed.\n                                                                \n\nCosts to respondents.\n                    \n\n                    \n\n     11Petitioners  argue  that the  Court's  opinion  in Mallard\n                                                                 \nmarked the dawning  of a  new era, calling  our prior  precedents\ninto serious question.

BACKGROUND\n\n          The United  States District  Court for the  District of\n\nMassachusetts  has been  involved with  the Treatment  Center for\n\nmore  than two decades.   In 1974,  the district court  entered a\n\nconsent decree  and supplemental  consent decree  in the case  of\n\nKing  v. Greenblatt.1   The decrees  placed the  Treatment Center\n                   \n\nunder the  primary authority  of the Massachusetts  Department of\n\nMental  Health  and  obligated  the  department  to  operate  the\n\nfacility  in accordance  with  certain standards.   The  district\n\ncourt specifically retained  the right to amend  the King decrees\n                                                         \n\nin the future.\n\n          Although  the original  plaintiff, King, soon  left the\n\nTreatment  Center, other  residents  took up  the cudgels.   Over\n\ntime,  inmates brought a variety of suits to enforce the decrees.\n\n                    \n\n     1King, an  individual  confined  at  the  Treatment  Center,\nbrought  suit,  inter  alia,  to   reform  certain  institutional\n                           \npolicies and  practices.  Relevant  portions of the  original and\nsupplemental consent decrees are  set forth as appendices  in two\nearlier decisions  of this court.  See  Pearson v.

Moreover,  in 1988,  the\n           \n\npetitioners intervened  in  the  King  case and  fended  off  the\n                                     \n\nCommonwealth's motion to vacate the judgment therein.\n\n          The continuing  saga of the federal courts' involvement\n\nwith  the Treatment  Center  took a  new  turn in  1992  when the\n\ndistrict  court,  acting  on   its  own  initiative  and  without\n\nproviding advance  notice, appointed a special  master to analyze\n\n\"the impact  of existing and  pending legislation on  the consent\n\ndecrees\" and on \"the operation of the Treatment Center\"; to study\n\nall unresolved claims alleging violations of the consent decrees;\n\nand  to  advise  the  court  concerning  the  Treatment  Center's\n\noperation and the continued viability of the King decrees.2\n                                                 \n\n          The petitioners  learned of  this initiative  after the\n\nfact.  They  did not take kindly to it.   When the district court\n\n                    \n\n     2The district  court's order is reproduced  in the appendix.\nWe omit therefrom the master's curriculum vitae.\n\n                                3\n\nrefused to alter its stance, the petitioners headed for the court\n\nof appeals.  In this forum, they ask for mandamus, asserting that\n\nthe  lower court lacked jurisdiction to  appoint a master because\n\nKing was dead,  juridically if not literally, and because neither\n    \n\nside was currently seeking,  or had recently sought, modification\n\nof the  King decrees.   Petitioners also assert  a host  of other\n            \n\nchallenges to the entry of the order and to its scope.\n\nII.  THE USES OF MANDAMUS\n\n          Congress  has authorized  the federal  courts to  issue\n\nprerogative writs  which are \"necessary or appropriate  in aid of\n\ntheir respective jurisdictions.\"  28 U.S.C.   1651(a) (1988).  As\n\nthe Court recently reminded us, a traditional use  of prerogative\n\nwrits  has been to confine inferior courts to the lawful exercise\n\nof their prescribed jurisdiction or compel them to exercise their\n\nauthority  when duty demands.

DISCUSSION\n\n          Because  petitioners'   variegated  challenges  reflect\n\nneither a  special risk of  significant harm  nor palpable  error\n\nattributable to the judge's  interlocutory order, mandamus is not\n\njustified.   For ease in presentation, we discuss these points in\n\nreverse order.\n\n                 A.  Presence of Palpable Error.\n                                               \n\n          The  petitioners have  failed  to demonstrate  that the\n\n                                6\n\ndistrict court lapsed into palpable error or, stated another way,\n\nthat  they  are clearly  entitled to  the  relief requested.   To\n\nexplain why  this is so,  we deal  extensively with  petitioners'\n\nmain \"case or controversy\" approach and then consider their other\n\nasseverations in a group.\n\n          1.  The Case  or Controversy Requirement.   Petitioners\n          1.  The Case  or Controversy Requirement.\n                                                  \n\nstrive  to convince  us  that, at  the  time the  district  court\n\nappointed the master, no justiciable case or controversy existed;\n\nand that,  therefore, the  court's order plainly  outstripped its\n\njurisdiction.  Petitioners' exhortation has two strands.  We find\n\nneither strand persuasive.\n\n                               a. \n                               a.\n                                 \n\n          The  first strand might be subtitled:  \"On the Death of\n\nKing.\"  Petitioners suggest that King was a \"dead case\" which the\n                                     \n\ndistrict  court improperly  resurrected.    Whatever this  morbid\n\nmetaphor may  mean, it misses the  mark.  The entry  of a consent\n\ndecree does not  \"kill\" a  case or terminate  a district  court's\n\njurisdiction.    Rather,  when,  as now,  an  injunction  entered\n\npursuant  to a  consent decree has  ongoing effects,  the issuing\n\ncourt retains authority to  enforce it.  See, e.g.,  System Fed'n\n                                                                 \n\nNo. 91, Etc. v.

By  the same token,  a court  retains\n\nauthority to modify or interpret such decrees in light of changed\n\n                                7\n\ncircumstances.

Even that  description may  be overly\n\npessimistic; petitioners  themselves became parties in  King five\n                                                            \n\nyears  ago  (when  the  district court  granted  their  motion to\n\nintervene), and their status  as parties has not been  altered by\n\n                    \n\n     5Here, of course, the district judge explicitly reserved the\npower to amend.  See Pearson I, 808 F.2d at 165.\n                              \n\n                                8\n\nany subsequent order.  In the second place, the King decrees have\n                                                    \n\nongoing  effects  and other  inmates  continue  to bring  actions\n\nseeking  their enforcement.   The  district court  obviously gave\n\nweight  to this reality, noting the \"many cases filed by patients\n\nat  the  Treatment Center.\"   Moreover,  in  opting to  appoint a\n\nmaster,  the  court made  specific  reference to  contemporaneous\n\nallegations  about institutional failings gathered by forty-eight\n\nTreatment  Center residents  desirous  of  improving their  lot.6\n\nAll things  considered, we find the tales  of King's demise to be\n                                                  \n\ngreatly exaggerated.\n\n                                b.\n                                  \n\n          The  second, more  substantial,  salvo of  petitioners'\n\njurisdictional  assault bombards the spontaneous character of the\n\ndistrict  court's action.   This  fusillade also  goes awry.   We\n\nbelieve that  a district court's jurisdiction to modify a consent\n\ndecree necessarily implies that  the court does not act  in clear\n\nexcess of its authority when it appoints a master, sua sponte, to\n                                                             \n\nlook into possible decree-modifying changes.  We explain briefly.\n\n          A consent decree is not simply a contract entered  into\n\nbetween private parties seeking to effectuate parochial concerns.\n\nSee  Firefighters v.

This must  mean that,  notwithstanding the\n\nparties'  silence or inertia, the district court is not doomed to\n\nsome Sisyphean  fate, bound  forever to  enforce and  interpret a\n\npreexisting  decree  without  occasionally  pausing  to  question\n\nwhether  changing   circumstances   have  rendered   the   decree\n\nunnecessary, outmoded, or even harmful to the public interest.\n\n          Against this  backdrop, the  fact that the  court acted\n\nsua sponte is not  fatal.

R. Civ. P.\n\n53(b)   is completely unfulfilled.  We disagree.\n\n          The  case at hand is  intricate.  Its circumstances are\n\nhighly ramified.  \"Change\" has been the  watchword virtually ever\n\nsince  the consent decrees were entered.  See, e.g., Langton, 928\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  at  1209-10  &amp;  nn.  2-4  (describing  certain  changes  in\n\npertinent  legislation over  time);  id. at  1212-13  (describing\n                                        \n\n                                13\n\nsubstantial changes in facilities and conditions of confinement);\n\nid.  at   1213-16  (describing  sweeping  changes   in  treatment\n   \n\nmodalities, programs,  and  the  like).   After  two  decades  of\n\nintimate   involvement  with   an   especially   complex   public\n\ninstitution  immersed in  a state  of continuing  transition, the\n\ndistrict court is still mired in litigation.  We  think that this\n\nscenario  at least  arguably reflects  an  exceptional condition.\n\nHence, appointing  a master to survey  the legislative landscape,\n\ninvestigate the  incidence and  impact of  changed circumstances,\n\nassess  the  current relevance  of  the decrees,  and  report the\n\nresults  to  the court  did not  constitute  palpable error  as a\n\nmatter of law.  See, e.g., Chicago Housing Auth., 511 F.2d at 83-\n                                                \n\n84  (refusing to annul district  court's appointment of master in\n\nanalogous  circumstances); see  also  NORML, 828  F.2d at  543-45\n                                           \n\n(explaining  that   complexity  of  litigation  and   of  decree-\n\ncompliance can  justify appointment of a  master in institutional\n\nreform litigation); Carey, 706 F.2d at 962-63 (similar).\n                         \n\n                                c.\n                                  \n\n          Petitioners  next complain  that  some of  the  matters\n\nreferred to the master outstrip the four corners of the pleadings\n\nin King.   The short  answer to this  plaint is that  the order's\n       \n\ntext does not  bear it  out.   The slightly  longer (but  equally\n\navailing) answer  is that the litigation's  procedural posture is\n\nstill  fluid.   The  district court  has  before it  a  number of\n\ncomplaints dealing with various aspects of  life at the Treatment\n\nCenter.  The order  plainly indicates that the court  proposes to\n\n                                14\n\ntreat  these  cases  as  a  group,  at  least  for  some  (as yet\n\nundefined)  purposes.   Class certification  remains a  seemingly\n\nviable option.  To the extent  (if at all) that the court intends\n\nthe order  of reference  to extend beyond  the sequestration-type\n\nissues  originally involved in  King, we  presume that  the court\n                                    \n\nwill travel an appropriate  procedural path.  See, e.g.,  Fed. R.\n                                                       \n\nCiv.  P. 42(a)  (discussing  requirements  for  consolidation  of\n\nactions); Fed. R.  Civ. P. 23 (discussing prerequisites  to class\n\naction  and related  matters);  Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 24  (discussing\n\nrequirements  for intervention).   We  see no  reason, therefore,\n\ngiven the confined office of a petition for mandamus, to stop the\n\ncourt in its tracks.\n\n                                d.\n                                  \n\n          Finally,  petitioners  claim  that  the  district court\n\nfailed to  provide them with notice before appointing the master.\n\nThey say, moreover, that  this omission was exacerbated by  an ex\n                                                                 \n\nparte  contact with respondents'  counsel (a contact  which, as a\n     \n\nbyproduct,  gave  respondents  advance  warning  of  the  judge's\n\nmindset).   We do  not believe  that, under  the totality  of the\n\ncircumstances, these facts warrant  the issuance of a prerogative\n\nwrit.\n\n          While it  seems logical  for a  trial court to  consult\n\nwith  affected parties  when contemplating  the appointment  of a\n\nmaster, the relevant procedural  rule does not explicitly require\n\nprior notice,  see Fed. R. Civ.  P. 53, and we  are unprepared to\n                  \n\nstate that advance consultation  is absolutely essential in every\n\n                                15\n\ninstance.8   Cf.

In  this unique situation,\n\nthe incidence of any error is problematic; and, at  any rate, the\n\nfailure to provide notice seems benign.\n\n          The  ex parte  contact  does not  stem  the tide.    It\n                       \n\nappears that the judge,  seeking to secure a commitment  from the\n\nCommonwealth to  absorb the master's  costs, directed a  clerk to\n\n                    \n\n     8Nonetheless, we  agree with the Ninth Circuit that, when an\norder  of reference is entered  sua sponte and  without notice, a\n                                          \nparty  who  considers himself  aggrieved  thereby  will be  given\nconsiderable latitude as to the form and timeliness of an ensuing\nobjection.

The order that  petitioners challenge  is\n\nmerely preliminary.  The  only thing that it accomplishes  is the\n\nappointment of a master to conduct certain studies, analyses, and\n\ninvestigations,   compile   a   report,   and   thereafter   make\n\nrecommendations to  the district judge.   We decline petitioners'\n\ninvitation to  speculate, at  this early  date, about  the purely\n\nhypothetical consequences  that may or  may not  flow from  these\n\noperose labors.10  Accord  Chicago Housing Auth., 511 F.2d  at 83\n                                                \n\n(rejecting similar challenge to similar order of reference).\n\n          Leaving rank speculation aside,  we can detect no other\n\nharm  of a kind sufficient to ground mandamus relief.  Certainly,\n\nany  increased  workload  that   may  result  from  the  master's\n\ninvolvement cannot turn the trick.  We have consistently rejected\n\nthe  general burdensomeness  of  litigation, standing  alone,  as\n\ncomprising a showing of  harm sufficient to animate the  power of\n\n                    \n\n     10Petitioners' argument  on this point is  built entirely on\nthe  fragile foundation  of conjecture  and surmise.   By  way of\nillustration, they  ruminate that,  if the master  makes findings\nconcerning,  say, the  ability of  Treatment Center  personnel to\nfunction under the King decrees, the district court may give such\n                       \nfindings  overly great  deference.   We prefer, however,  to deal\nwith  the  actuality of  a  developed  situation rather  than  to\nanticipate that a federal district court will lapse into manifest\nerror.   Cf. W. Shakespeare, Macbeth, act  I, sc. iii, ll. 133-34\n                                    \n(1605) (suggesting that, frequently, \"present fears are less than\nhorrible imaginings\").\n\n                                18\n\nmandamus.11   See, e.g.,  Recticel, 859 F.2d  at 1006 n.5;  In re\n                                                                 \n\nJustices, 695 F.2d at 20.\n        \n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go  no further.   Mandamus is an  extraordinary\n\nremedy which \"should be dispensed sparingly and only in pursuance\n\nof the  most carefully  written prescription, not  made available\n\nover  the counter, on casual demand.   It is not a substitute for\n\ninterlocutory  appeal.\"   Recticel,  859 F.2d  at  1005.   In its\n                                  \n\npresent posture, this case does not warrant a dose of such strong\n\nmedicine.   The record here  is, for the  most part, malady-free;\n\nand  any symptoms  of  arguable error,  if  later shown  to  have\n\nblossomed into full blown diseases, are amenable to a traditional\n\ncure on direct appeal.\n\n          The  petition for  mandamus  is  denied and  dismissed.\n                                                                \n\nCosts to respondents.\n                    \n\n                    \n\n     11Petitioners  argue  that the  Court's  opinion  in Mallard\n                                                                 \nmarked the dawning  of a  new era, calling  our prior  precedents\ninto serious question.  We  disagree.  Mallard did not deal  with\n                                              \nthe general burdensomeness of litigation at all; rather, the case\ninvolved an attorney compelled by a court to provide professional\nservices against his will.
