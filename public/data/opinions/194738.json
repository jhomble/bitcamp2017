Blakeney, Jr. for appellant.\n                       \nWilliam F.  Sinnott, Assistant United  States Attorney, with  whom\n                   \nA.  John  Pappalardo,  United  States  Attorney,  was  on  brief,  for\n                \nappellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                         May 24, 1993\n                                         \n\n          BOWNES, Senior  Circuit  Judge.   In  this  appeal,\n          BOWNES, Senior  Circuit  Judge.\n                                        \n\ndefendant-appellant, Frank Japa, seeks  to vacate his plea of\n\nguilty because  of alleged errors made by  the district court\n\nduring the change of plea hearing.  Japa also claims that the\n\ndistrict court erred during the sentencing hearing.\n\n          After an  undercover operation,  Japa and  one Jos \n\nPuello  were  arrested for  drug  trafficking.   A  two-count\n\nindictment was returned against them.  Count One charged both\n\nwith conspiring to possess  cocaine with intent to distribute\n\nin violation  of 21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1) and 846.   Count Two\n\ncharged them  with possessing  500 grams  or more  of cocaine\n\nwith  intent to distribute within  1,000 feet of  a public or\n\nprivate  school in violation of  21 U.S.C.     841 (a)(1) and\n\n845(a) (now   860) and 18 U.S.C.   2.  Puello is not involved\n\nin this appeal.\n\n          After  initially  pleading  not  guilty,  defendant\n\nchanged  his  plea to  guilty.   There  was no  plea bargain.\n\nBecause  defendant was  Spanish-speaking, an  interpreter was\n\nused  during both the change of plea and sentencing hearings.\n\nDefendant was  sentenced to seventy months'  incarceration to\n\nbe  followed  by  a  supervised release  term  of  ninety-six\n\nmonths.    Because defendant  was  impecunious,  no fine  was\n\nimposed; he was ordered to pay a special assessment of $100.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n                The Change of Plea Proceedings\n                                              \n\n          Defendant attacks  the  plea proceedings  on  three\n\ngrounds:  (1) he  was not adequately informed of  the maximum\n\npossible sentence; (2) his plea was not voluntary because  he\n\ndid not understand the charges against him; and (3) there was\n\nnot an adequate record  of a factual basis for  accepting his\n\nplea.  We discuss these claims seriatim.\n\n       Informing Defendant of Maximum Possible Sentence\n                                                       \n\n          Although there may have  been some confusion at the\n\noutset of  the maximum-penalty discussion,  the transcript of\n\nthe  change   of  plea  hearing  shows   that  defendant  was\n\nadequately informed of and  understood the maximum penalty he\n\nfaced.  A resum  of the plea hearing follows.\n\n          Defendant was  asked by the court  what the maximum\n\nsentence on Count  One was.  He replied, \"I  think it is five\n\nyears.\"    The  court  said,  \"I thought  it  was  15.\"   The\n\nAssistant United States Attorney then stated:\n\n             MR.  O'CONNOR:   Your  Honor, it's  20\n          years.   But I would also  note that it's\n          going to be a  sentencing issue, but  the\n          quantity of cocaine that is relevant with\n          respect  to both  Counts  1 and  2 is  at\n          least 500 grams, so  at a minimum he will\n          be in a range under the minimum mandatory\n          provision of  five to 40 years.   This is\n          statutory,  two million-dollar  fine, $50\n          on each  count, and  a four-year term  of\n          supervised  release,  at  least, on  each\n          count.\n\nDefendant was  then asked  by the court,  \"Do you  understand\n\nthat?\"   He replied,  \"Yes, sir.\"   He was  then asked  if he\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nunderstood that \"all of that can be added up,  the two counts\n\nadded together.\"  He  replied, \"Yes.\"  It was  then explained\n\nto  defendant that  the five-year  statutory minimum  was the\n\n\"floor.\"  The Assistant United States Attorney then described\n\nthe guideline range:\n\n             The  guideline  range  is  63  to  78.\n          However, I would note that in Count 2 the\n          Court  will notice  he  is  charged  with\n          distribution within a  thousand feet of a\n          school  yard, which  allows the  Court to\n          punish up to two  times.  The  guidelines\n          say  it would be  a two  level adjustment\n          upwards  if  the  government   proves  at\n          sentencing  that it was within a thousand\n          feet of  a school  yard, which  would put\n          him within a  range of 78 to 97  but then\n          he may get  acceptance of  responsibility\n          which would put him back to 63 to 78.  So\n          really  what  we're   talking  about   is\n          somewhere  in the neighborhood of five to\n          six years, five to six and a half years.\n\nAfter the  explanation of the guideline  range was completed,\n\nthe  court asked defendant  if he understood  what the United\n\nStates Attorney  had been talking about.   Defendant replied,\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"  The following colloquy then took place:\n\n             THE COURT:  Do you understand that I'm\n          obliged to sentence within the guidelines\n          unless    there     is    some    special\n          circumstance?   And if  there are special\n          circumstances,   I   can  go   above  the\n          guidelines  or below,  I can  depart from\n          the guidelines, up to the  maximum, which\n          I think  is 40 years on each  count for a\n          possible  80  years.    In  general,  the\n          sentence will be within the guidelines as\n          more  or  less  described by  the  U.  S.\n          Attorney.\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  Yes.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          Following this, the court asked defendant if anyone\n\nhad  told him \"what sentence the Court would, in fact, impose\n\nin the  event of a  plea of  guilty?\"  The  defendant replied\n\nthat his attorney had told him he would serve \"about one year\n\nand a half  or something like that.\"   The court  pointed out\n\nthat it had just been explained to defendant that the minimum\n\nsentence was five  years.  The  court then asked  defendant's\n\nattorney if  he  had an  explanation for  what defendant  had\n\nstated.   Defendant's  attorney  stated:   \"I  don't have  an\n\nexplanation because it didn't  occur.\"  The attorney  said he\n\ndiscussed the guidelines  with defendant without  the benefit\n\nof  an interpreter.   The  attorney then  suggested that  the\n\ncourt  ask  defendant  \"if he  understands  .  .  . that  the\n\nguidelines  go anywhere  from four  to six  years generally.\"\n\nThe court then stated to defendant:\n\n             Mr. Japa, there is no way that anybody\n          could have told you what I am going to do\n          because I  don't know what  I'm going  to\n          do, and  I will  come up with  a sentence\n          somewhere  within  the  ranges,   in  all\n          likelihood,  that  we  have been  talking\n          about, that is five  to six and  possibly\n          seven years.  Do you understand that?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.\n\n          Defendant was then asked if he wanted to change his\n\nplea.    After  a  discussion  with  his  attorney,  with  an\n\ninterpreter present,  defendant stated  that he wished  to go\n\nforward with  a plea  of guilty.   In  answer to the  court's\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nquestion,  \"Is   your  plea  of  guilty   entirely  free  and\n\nvoluntary?\", the defendant answered, \"Yes.\"\n\n          Based on the record of  the change of plea hearing,\n\nwe find  that defendant was properly informed  of the maximum\n\npenalty  provided   by  law   and  that  he   understood  the\n\nconsequences of pleading guilty.\n\n          Defendant  also  alleges that  he  was inadequately\n\ninformed  of  the  term  of supervised  release  he  could be\n\nrequired  to serve.  Defendant was, in fact, sentenced to the\n\nprecise  term  of supervised  release  of which  he  had been\n\ninformed at the hearing.\n\n                    Voluntariness of Plea\n                                         \n\n          The standard for setting aside a plea that has been\n\nentered and sentence imposed is  narrow.  Defendant must show\n\na  fundamental defect or a  miscarriage of justice.   Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P.   32(d) provides:\n\n             (d) Plea Withdrawal.  If a motion  for\n             (d) Plea Withdrawal.\n          withdrawal of  a plea  of guilty  or nolo\n          contendere  is  made  before sentence  is\n          imposed, the court may  permit withdrawal\n          of  the   plea  upon  a  showing  by  the\n          defendant  of any  fair and  just reason.\n          At  any later  time,  a plea  may be  set\n                                                   \n          aside only on direct appeal or by  motion\n                                                   \n          under  28  U.S.C.      2255.    (Emphasis\n                                      \n          added.)\n\nIt is the last sentence that is implicated here.  The Note of\n\nthe  Advisory  Committee on  the  Federal  Rules of  Criminal\n\nProcedure discussing the 1983  amendment to Rule 32(d) states\n\nin pertinent part:\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          Under  the  amendment,  a  defendant  who\n          proceeds too  late to come under the more\n          generous \"fair and just  reason\" standard\n          must seek  relief  under    2255, meaning\n          the applicable standard is that stated in\n          Hill  v.  United  States,  368  U.S.  424\n                                  \n          (1962):    \"a  fundamental  defect  which\n          inherently   results    in   a   complete\n          miscarriage of justice\"  or \"an  omission\n          inconsistent with the rudimentary demands\n          of fair procedure.\"\n\n          Moreover, Rule 11,  which governs plea  procedures,\n\nexpressly provides  in  part (h):    \"Any variance  from  the\n\nprocedures  required  by  this  rule which  does  not  affect\n\nsubstantial rights shall be disregarded.\"\n\n          With this standard of  review in place, we consider\n\ndefendant's arguments.   Defendant  contends that his  guilty\n\nplea  was  not  voluntary  because  the  record  of  the plea\n\ncolloquy does not show that he understood the charges against\n\nhim.   Specifically, defendant  asserts that the  record does\n\nnot establish that he understood the quantity of drugs he was\n\ncharged with  possessing, the  charge of conspiracy,  and the\n\nelement of intent.\n\n          We start  our analysis  with the transcript  of the\n\nchange of plea proceedings:\n\n             THE COURT:   This indictment  suggests\n          that  you  ---  it  doesn't  suggest,  it\n          charges  you with  combining, conspiring,\n          confederating  and   agreeing  with  Jose\n          Puello   and   with   other  persons   to\n          knowingly  and  intentionally  possess  a\n          mixture containing cocaine with an intent\n          to distribute it on or about August 29th,\n          1990.   Now, did  you agree to  possess a\n          mixture containing cocaine on that day?\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:   Yes, sir.\n\n             THE COURT:  With Mr. Puelloand others?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.\n\n             THE COURT:   All  right.  And  did you\n          intend to distribute the cocaine?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.\n\n             THE  COURT:    And  on  September 3rd,\n          1990, did you and Mr. Puello, possess 500\n          grams  or more  of  a mixture  containing\n          cocaine  within  a  thousand  feet  of  a\n          public school in the City of Lynn?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.\n\nAfter the prosecutor had summarized the government's evidence\n\nthe following colloquy took place:\n\n             THE   COURT:      Is    that   summary\n          essentially true, Mr. Japa?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  Basically.\n\n             THE COURT:  In what respect is it not?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  About the whole amount\n          of the cocaine.\n\n             THE COURT:  What does he say?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  I  was saying it was a\n          kilo and I sold more, that sort of thing.\n          I didn't say any of that.\n\n             THE COURT:  You did try to sell them a\n          pound or a half kilo?\n\n             THE  DEFENDANT:   That was  the truth,\n          but no more than that.\n\n             THE COURT:  All right.  Do you know of\n          any  reason  why  the  Court  should  not\n          accept your plea of guilty?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  No.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n          During the prosecutor's summary of  the evidence it\n\nwas made clear that, although originally defendant had agreed\n\nto provide one  kilo of cocaine to  the government informant,\n\nthe amount  provided was one-half of  a kilo.  A  gram is one\n\nthousandth of  a kilogram;  500 grams,  which was  the amount\n\ndefendant  was  charged with  possessing,  is  one-half of  a\n\nkilogram, or slightly more than one pound.  We hold that  the\n\nrecord establishes that  defendant understood  the amount  of\n\ndrugs he was charged with possessing.\n\n          We also  find, based on the  record, that defendant\n\nunderstood  he was  charged  with conspiring  with others  to\n\npossess and  distribute 500 grams  of cocaine.   The district\n\ncourt told  defendant he was charged in  the indictment \"with\n\ncombining, conspiring, confederating, and agreeing  with Jose\n\nPuello  and  with  other   persons,\"  etc.    Defendant  gave\n\naffirmative  answers (\"Yes,  Sir\")  to two  questions by  the\n\ncourt asking  whether  he agreed  with Puello  and others  to\n\npossess cocaine on August 29th.  Defendant did not advise the\n\ncourt  either  himself or  through  counsel that  he  did not\n\nunderstand  the conspiracy  charge.   We  do not  think that,\n\nwhere  a  defendant  is   represented  by  counsel,1  and  no\n\nspecific claim is made that the defendant does not understand\n\n                    \n\n1.     Defendant has  indicated that there may  be a claim of\nincompetency of counsel waiting  in the wings.  Such  a claim\nis  not an issue  in this case  and except for  noting it, we\nmake no comment.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\na question or explanation by the court as to  what is charged\n\nin  an  indictment, the  court is  required  to do  more than\n\nexplain the  charges in  plain understandable language.   The\n\nconspiracy  charge met  this test.   We  add that  a detailed\n\nexplanation  of \"conspiracy\"  with  its  many  nuances  would\n\nprobably result in confusion and bewilderment of a defendant.\n\n       Understanding of Intent   Factual Basis for Plea\n                                                       \n\n          Defendant's claim that the record  is inadequate to\n\nestablish that he understood the intent element of the crimes\n\ncharged necessarily includes his contention that there was an\n\ninadequate factual basis  for accepting a plea of  guilty, as\n\nwe explain below.\n\n          We start  our analysis with the  indictment.  Count\n\nOne charges  as follows.  \"From  on or about August  29, 1990\n\nand continuing to  on or  about September 3,  1990\" in  Lynn,\n\nMassachusetts, the defendants Frank  Japa and Jos  Puello did\n\nconspire \"knowingly and intentionally to possess with  intent\n                                                             \n\nto  distribute\" 500  grams  of  cocaine.    The  court  asked\n              \n\ndefendant two separate questions:  did he possess the cocaine\n\nand did he intend to distribute it.  Defendant answered \"yes\"\n\nto both  questions.   This was  sufficient to  establish that\n\ndefendant understood the element of intent as to Count One.\n\n          A problem  arises, however,  as to the  adequacy of\n\nthe  court's question covering Count Two.   Count Two charges\n\nthat \"On or about September 3, 1990\" the defendants, Japa and\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nPuello, \"did knowingly and intentionally  possess with intent\n\nto  distribute 500 grams\" [a mixture containing cocaine]. . .\n\n\"and  did  so  within 1000  feet\"  [of  a  public or  private\n\nschool].  The  court's question of  defendant on this  count,\n\nhowever, omitted any inquiry as to intent.  Defendant was not\n\nasked  whether  he intended  to  possess  and distribute  the\n                                                        \n\ncocaine within 1,000 feet of a school.  The court asked  only\n\nwhether  defendant and Puello  \"did possess  500 grams\"  of a\n\nmixture  containing cocaine  within  1,000 feet  of a  public\n\nschool.  This omission  was compounded by the failure  of the\n\ngovernment  to  say anything  about a  school  at all  in its\n\nstatement of proof.\n\n          At the outset of our discussion we frame the  issue\n\nbefore us:   Was  the omission  of an  intent inquiry  by the\n\ndistrict court,  combined with the failure  of the prosecutor\n\nto  include in his proof statement any reference to a school,\n\n\"a  fundamental   defect  [in  the   plea  proceeding]  which\n\ninherently results  in a complete miscarriage  of justice\" or\n\n\"an  omission inconsistent  with the  rudimentary  demands of\n\nfair  procedure?\"  Hill v.  United States, 368  U.S. 424, 428\n                                         \n\n(1962).   Or  to put  a  different cast  on it,  did the  two\n\nomissions affect  substantial rights  of defendant?   Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(h).  We think not, for the reasons that follow. \n\n          The presentence  report, in the  section on offense\n\nconduct,  contains  this statement:    \"Japa's apartment  was\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nwithin 1000  feet of a  schoolyard in Lynn.\"2   There  was no\n\nobjection  to this  or any other  statement in the  PSI.3  We\n\nheld  in United States v.  Zorrilla, 982 F.2d  28, 30-31 (1st\n                                   \n\nCir. 1992), that information in the presentence report and/or\n\nadduced  at  the probable  cause  hearing  was sufficient  to\n\nsatisfy the  elements of the  crime charged  even though  the\n\ndistrict court judge  failed to establish a factual basis for\n\nthe  plea at  the hearing.   The  defendant here  admitted to\n\npossessing  cocaine within 1,000 feet of a public school.  He\n\nalso admitted in  answer to questions  by the court  covering\n\nCount  One  that he  and  Puello  possessed  and intended  to\n\ndistribute 500 grams of  cocaine.  It is obvious  that Counts\n\nOne and  Two referred to the  same cocaine    a one-half kilo\n\nblock.    Our  focus  is  on  whether  defendant's  plea  was\n\nvoluntary,  not  whether  the  government proved  him  guilty\n\nbeyond  a  reasonable doubt.   We  said  in United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nAllard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1244 (1st Cir. 1991):\n      \n\n             The effect of a failure to comply with\n          the requirements of Rule 11  depends upon\n          the   nature  of   the  failure.     Mere\n          technical  violations  of its  procedural\n          requirements do not warrant setting aside\n          a plea.   That is especially  true if the\n          defendant was not  misled or the omission\n          did not affect his decision.\n\n                    \n\n2.    The  cocaine had been taken  from defendant's apartment\nand placed in a car where it was seized. \n\n3.     We discuss defendant's contentions relative to the PSI\ninfra.\n     \n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n          We have read the  transcript of the change  of plea\n\nhearing carefully,  bearing in mind that  defendant needed an\n\ninterpreter  to translate  from English  to Spanish  and vice\n\nversa.  Defendant never suggested that he did not  understand\n\nany  part of what was being said to  him or about him.  There\n\nwas no complaint about the competency of the interpreter.  We\n\nconclude that defendant's plea was knowing and voluntary.4\n\n                          Sentencing\n                                    \n\n          Defendant  claims that the  district court erred by\n\nfailing either  to inquire  directly of defendant  whether he\n\nhad  an opportunity  to  review and  discuss the  presentence\n\nreport,  or to  have the  record reflect  that defendant  and\n\ncounsel had an adequate opportunity for such review.  Neither\n\nclaim is supported by the record.\n\n                    \n\n4.    Because  of the context of this case, we see no need to\ndecide  whether the schoolyard  statute, 21 U.S.C.    860, is\nambiguous  and   whether  intent  to  distribute  within  the\nschoolyard  zone  has to  be  proven  by the  government,  or\nwhether it is irrelevant  or can be imputed to  the defendant\nso  long as he possesses an amount of illegal substances from\nwhich intent  to distribute may  reasonably be inferred.   To\ndate, Courts of Appeal in the District of Columbia, Third and\nFifth Circuits have held that the  government is not required\nto prove intent to distribute within the protected zone.  See\n                                                             \nUnited  States v. McDonald, No. 92-3047, slip. op. at 5 (D.C.\n                          \nCir. April 30,  1993); United States  v.

Then followed  a rather\n\nlengthy argument by  defendant's attorney that defendant  was\n\nentitled  to a  minor-role  point deduction.   The  Assistant\n\nUnited States Attorney  pointed out that  the issue was  moot\n\nbecause  under  the statute  the  minimum  sentence was  five\n\nyears.  The court correctly  held that \"the minimum mandatory\n\ntrumps  the guidelines.\"    After further  discussion by  the\n\nAssistant United  States Attorney  and defense counsel  as to\n\ndefendant's  role  in   the  offense,  the  court   sentenced\n\ndefendant   to  imprisonment  \"for   70  months,   96  months\n\nsupervised release,  no fine,  no restitution, and  a hundred\n\ndollars  special assessment.\"   The  sentence was  within the\n\nguideline range of 63 to 78.\n\n          The  statements of  defense counsel  show that  the\n\ndistrict court  did inquire as  to whether defendant  and his\n\ncounsel had an adequate opportunity to review the presentence\n\nreport.  Defense counsel's answer  to the court's question on\n\nthis  score  and his  argument on  his  client's role  in the\n\noffense  showed that  defendant's attorney was  familiar with\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nthe presentence report and  the factual and legal conclusions\n\ncontained therein.   Moreover, defendant has  not pointed out\n\nto us any inaccuracies in the presentence report.  This means\n\nthat  even if  there were an  error in  the manner  the court\n\nconducted the disposition hearing, and we have found none, it\n\nwould be harmless.\n\n     Affirmed.   \n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n",

John  Pappalardo,  United  States  Attorney,  was  on  brief,  for\n                \nappellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                         May 24, 1993\n                                         \n\n          BOWNES, Senior  Circuit  Judge.   In  this  appeal,\n          BOWNES, Senior  Circuit  Judge.\n                                        \n\ndefendant-appellant, Frank Japa, seeks  to vacate his plea of\n\nguilty because  of alleged errors made by  the district court\n\nduring the change of plea hearing.  Japa also claims that the\n\ndistrict court erred during the sentencing hearing.\n\n          After an  undercover operation,  Japa and  one Jos \n\nPuello  were  arrested for  drug  trafficking.   A  two-count\n\nindictment was returned against them.  Count One charged both\n\nwith conspiring to possess  cocaine with intent to distribute\n\nin violation  of 21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1) and 846.   Count Two\n\ncharged them  with possessing  500 grams  or more  of cocaine\n\nwith  intent to distribute within  1,000 feet of  a public or\n\nprivate  school in violation of  21 U.S.C.     841 (a)(1) and\n\n845(a) (now   860) and 18 U.S.C.   2.  Puello is not involved\n\nin this appeal.\n\n          After  initially  pleading  not  guilty,  defendant\n\nchanged  his  plea to  guilty.   There  was no  plea bargain.\n\nBecause  defendant was  Spanish-speaking, an  interpreter was\n\nused  during both the change of plea and sentencing hearings.\n\nDefendant was  sentenced to seventy months'  incarceration to\n\nbe  followed  by  a  supervised release  term  of  ninety-six\n\nmonths.    Because defendant  was  impecunious,  no fine  was\n\nimposed; he was ordered to pay a special assessment of $100.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n                The Change of Plea Proceedings\n                                              \n\n          Defendant attacks  the  plea proceedings  on  three\n\ngrounds:  (1) he  was not adequately informed of  the maximum\n\npossible sentence; (2) his plea was not voluntary because  he\n\ndid not understand the charges against him; and (3) there was\n\nnot an adequate record  of a factual basis for  accepting his\n\nplea.  We discuss these claims seriatim.\n\n       Informing Defendant of Maximum Possible Sentence\n                                                       \n\n          Although there may have  been some confusion at the\n\noutset of  the maximum-penalty discussion,  the transcript of\n\nthe  change   of  plea  hearing  shows   that  defendant  was\n\nadequately informed of and  understood the maximum penalty he\n\nfaced.  A resum  of the plea hearing follows.\n\n          Defendant was  asked by the court  what the maximum\n\nsentence on Count  One was.  He replied, \"I  think it is five\n\nyears.\"    The  court  said,  \"I thought  it  was  15.\"   The\n\nAssistant United States Attorney then stated:\n\n             MR.  O'CONNOR:   Your  Honor, it's  20\n          years.   But I would also  note that it's\n          going to be a  sentencing issue, but  the\n          quantity of cocaine that is relevant with\n          respect  to both  Counts  1 and  2 is  at\n          least 500 grams, so  at a minimum he will\n          be in a range under the minimum mandatory\n          provision of  five to 40 years.   This is\n          statutory,  two million-dollar  fine, $50\n          on each  count, and  a four-year term  of\n          supervised  release,  at  least, on  each\n          count.\n\nDefendant was  then asked  by the court,  \"Do you  understand\n\nthat?\"   He replied,  \"Yes, sir.\"   He was  then asked  if he\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nunderstood that \"all of that can be added up,  the two counts\n\nadded together.\"  He  replied, \"Yes.\"  It was  then explained\n\nto  defendant that  the five-year  statutory minimum  was the\n\n\"floor.\"  The Assistant United States Attorney then described\n\nthe guideline range:\n\n             The  guideline  range  is  63  to  78.\n          However, I would note that in Count 2 the\n          Court  will notice  he  is  charged  with\n          distribution within a  thousand feet of a\n          school  yard, which  allows the  Court to\n          punish up to two  times.  The  guidelines\n          say  it would be  a two  level adjustment\n          upwards  if  the  government   proves  at\n          sentencing  that it was within a thousand\n          feet of  a school  yard, which  would put\n          him within a  range of 78 to 97  but then\n          he may get  acceptance of  responsibility\n          which would put him back to 63 to 78.  So\n          really  what  we're   talking  about   is\n          somewhere  in the neighborhood of five to\n          six years, five to six and a half years.\n\nAfter the  explanation of the guideline  range was completed,\n\nthe  court asked defendant  if he understood  what the United\n\nStates Attorney  had been talking about.   Defendant replied,\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"  The following colloquy then took place:\n\n             THE COURT:  Do you understand that I'm\n          obliged to sentence within the guidelines\n          unless    there     is    some    special\n          circumstance?   And if  there are special\n          circumstances,   I   can  go   above  the\n          guidelines  or below,  I can  depart from\n          the guidelines, up to the  maximum, which\n          I think  is 40 years on each  count for a\n          possible  80  years.    In  general,  the\n          sentence will be within the guidelines as\n          more  or  less  described by  the  U.  S.\n          Attorney.\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  Yes.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          Following this, the court asked defendant if anyone\n\nhad  told him \"what sentence the Court would, in fact, impose\n\nin the  event of a  plea of  guilty?\"  The  defendant replied\n\nthat his attorney had told him he would serve \"about one year\n\nand a half  or something like that.\"   The court  pointed out\n\nthat it had just been explained to defendant that the minimum\n\nsentence was five  years.  The  court then asked  defendant's\n\nattorney if  he  had an  explanation for  what defendant  had\n\nstated.   Defendant's  attorney  stated:   \"I  don't have  an\n\nexplanation because it didn't  occur.\"  The attorney  said he\n\ndiscussed the guidelines  with defendant without  the benefit\n\nof  an interpreter.   The  attorney then  suggested that  the\n\ncourt  ask  defendant  \"if he  understands  .  .  . that  the\n\nguidelines  go anywhere  from four  to six  years generally.\"\n\nThe court then stated to defendant:\n\n             Mr. Japa, there is no way that anybody\n          could have told you what I am going to do\n          because I  don't know what  I'm going  to\n          do, and  I will  come up with  a sentence\n          somewhere  within  the  ranges,   in  all\n          likelihood,  that  we  have been  talking\n          about, that is five  to six and  possibly\n          seven years.  Do you understand that?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.\n\n          Defendant was then asked if he wanted to change his\n\nplea.    After  a  discussion  with  his  attorney,  with  an\n\ninterpreter present,  defendant stated  that he wished  to go\n\nforward with  a plea  of guilty.   In  answer to the  court's\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nquestion,  \"Is   your  plea  of  guilty   entirely  free  and\n\nvoluntary?\", the defendant answered, \"Yes.\"\n\n          Based on the record of  the change of plea hearing,\n\nwe find  that defendant was properly informed  of the maximum\n\npenalty  provided   by  law   and  that  he   understood  the\n\nconsequences of pleading guilty.\n\n          Defendant  also  alleges that  he  was inadequately\n\ninformed  of  the  term  of supervised  release  he  could be\n\nrequired  to serve.  Defendant was, in fact, sentenced to the\n\nprecise  term  of supervised  release  of which  he  had been\n\ninformed at the hearing.\n\n                    Voluntariness of Plea\n                                         \n\n          The standard for setting aside a plea that has been\n\nentered and sentence imposed is  narrow.

Defendant  contends that his  guilty\n\nplea  was  not  voluntary  because  the  record  of  the plea\n\ncolloquy does not show that he understood the charges against\n\nhim.   Specifically, defendant  asserts that the  record does\n\nnot establish that he understood the quantity of drugs he was\n\ncharged with  possessing, the  charge of conspiracy,  and the\n\nelement of intent.\n\n          We start  our analysis  with the transcript  of the\n\nchange of plea proceedings:\n\n             THE COURT:   This indictment  suggests\n          that  you  ---  it  doesn't  suggest,  it\n          charges  you with  combining, conspiring,\n          confederating  and   agreeing  with  Jose\n          Puello   and   with   other  persons   to\n          knowingly  and  intentionally  possess  a\n          mixture containing cocaine with an intent\n          to distribute it on or about August 29th,\n          1990.   Now, did  you agree to  possess a\n          mixture containing cocaine on that day?\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:   Yes, sir.\n\n             THE COURT:  With Mr. Puelloand others?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.\n\n             THE COURT:   All  right.  And  did you\n          intend to distribute the cocaine?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.\n\n             THE  COURT:    And  on  September 3rd,\n          1990, did you and Mr. Puello, possess 500\n          grams  or more  of  a mixture  containing\n          cocaine  within  a  thousand  feet  of  a\n          public school in the City of Lynn?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  Yes, sir.\n\nAfter the prosecutor had summarized the government's evidence\n\nthe following colloquy took place:\n\n             THE   COURT:      Is    that   summary\n          essentially true, Mr. Japa?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  Basically.\n\n             THE COURT:  In what respect is it not?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  About the whole amount\n          of the cocaine.\n\n             THE COURT:  What does he say?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  I  was saying it was a\n          kilo and I sold more, that sort of thing.\n          I didn't say any of that.\n\n             THE COURT:  You did try to sell them a\n          pound or a half kilo?\n\n             THE  DEFENDANT:   That was  the truth,\n          but no more than that.\n\n             THE COURT:  All right.  Do you know of\n          any  reason  why  the  Court  should  not\n          accept your plea of guilty?\n\n             THE DEFENDANT:  No.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n          During the prosecutor's summary of  the evidence it\n\nwas made clear that, although originally defendant had agreed\n\nto provide one  kilo of cocaine to  the government informant,\n\nthe amount  provided was one-half of  a kilo.  A  gram is one\n\nthousandth of  a kilogram;  500 grams,  which was  the amount\n\ndefendant  was  charged with  possessing,  is  one-half of  a\n\nkilogram, or slightly more than one pound.  We hold that  the\n\nrecord establishes that  defendant understood  the amount  of\n\ndrugs he was charged with possessing.\n\n          We also  find, based on the  record, that defendant\n\nunderstood  he was  charged  with conspiring  with others  to\n\npossess and  distribute 500 grams  of cocaine.   The district\n\ncourt told  defendant he was charged in  the indictment \"with\n\ncombining, conspiring, confederating, and agreeing  with Jose\n\nPuello  and  with  other   persons,\"  etc.    Defendant  gave\n\naffirmative  answers (\"Yes,  Sir\")  to two  questions by  the\n\ncourt asking  whether  he agreed  with Puello  and others  to\n\npossess cocaine on August 29th.  Defendant did not advise the\n\ncourt  either  himself or  through  counsel that  he  did not\n\nunderstand  the conspiracy  charge.   We  do not  think that,\n\nwhere  a  defendant  is   represented  by  counsel,1  and  no\n\nspecific claim is made that the defendant does not understand\n\n                    \n\n1.     Defendant has  indicated that there may  be a claim of\nincompetency of counsel waiting  in the wings.  Such  a claim\nis  not an issue  in this case  and except for  noting it, we\nmake no comment.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\na question or explanation by the court as to  what is charged\n\nin  an  indictment, the  court is  required  to do  more than\n\nexplain the  charges in  plain understandable language.   The\n\nconspiracy  charge met  this test.   We  add that  a detailed\n\nexplanation  of \"conspiracy\"  with  its  many  nuances  would\n\nprobably result in confusion and bewilderment of a defendant.\n\n       Understanding of Intent   Factual Basis for Plea\n                                                       \n\n          Defendant's claim that the record  is inadequate to\n\nestablish that he understood the intent element of the crimes\n\ncharged necessarily includes his contention that there was an\n\ninadequate factual basis  for accepting a plea of  guilty, as\n\nwe explain below.\n\n          We start  our analysis with the  indictment.  Count\n\nOne charges  as follows.  \"From  on or about August  29, 1990\n\nand continuing to  on or  about September 3,  1990\" in  Lynn,\n\nMassachusetts, the defendants Frank  Japa and Jos  Puello did\n\nconspire \"knowingly and intentionally to possess with  intent\n                                                             \n\nto  distribute\" 500  grams  of  cocaine.    The  court  asked\n              \n\ndefendant two separate questions:  did he possess the cocaine\n\nand did he intend to distribute it.  Defendant answered \"yes\"\n\nto both  questions.   This was  sufficient to  establish that\n\ndefendant understood the element of intent as to Count One.\n\n          A problem  arises, however,  as to the  adequacy of\n\nthe  court's question covering Count Two.   Count Two charges\n\nthat \"On or about September 3, 1990\" the defendants, Japa and\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nPuello, \"did knowingly and intentionally  possess with intent\n\nto  distribute 500 grams\" [a mixture containing cocaine]. . .\n\n\"and  did  so  within 1000  feet\"  [of  a  public or  private\n\nschool].  The  court's question of  defendant on this  count,\n\nhowever, omitted any inquiry as to intent.  Defendant was not\n\nasked  whether  he intended  to  possess  and distribute  the\n                                                        \n\ncocaine within 1,000 feet of a school.  The court asked  only\n\nwhether  defendant and Puello  \"did possess  500 grams\"  of a\n\nmixture  containing cocaine  within  1,000 feet  of a  public\n\nschool.  This omission  was compounded by the failure  of the\n\ngovernment  to  say anything  about a  school  at all  in its\n\nstatement of proof.\n\n          At the outset of our discussion we frame the  issue\n\nbefore us:   Was  the omission  of an  intent inquiry  by the\n\ndistrict court,  combined with the failure  of the prosecutor\n\nto  include in his proof statement any reference to a school,\n\n\"a  fundamental   defect  [in  the   plea  proceeding]  which\n\ninherently results  in a complete miscarriage  of justice\" or\n\n\"an  omission inconsistent  with the  rudimentary  demands of\n\nfair  procedure?\"  Hill v.

The  defendant here  admitted to\n\npossessing  cocaine within 1,000 feet of a public school.  He\n\nalso admitted in  answer to questions  by the court  covering\n\nCount  One  that he  and  Puello  possessed  and intended  to\n\ndistribute 500 grams of  cocaine.  It is obvious  that Counts\n\nOne and  Two referred to the  same cocaine    a one-half kilo\n\nblock.    Our  focus  is  on  whether  defendant's  plea  was\n\nvoluntary,  not  whether  the  government proved  him  guilty\n\nbeyond  a  reasonable doubt.   We  said  in United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nAllard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556604\"><a href=\"/opinion/556604/united-states-v-raymond-p-allard/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1244 (1st Cir. 1991):\n      \n\n             The effect of a failure to comply with\n          the requirements of Rule 11  depends upon\n          the   nature  of   the  failure.     Mere\n          technical  violations  of its  procedural\n          requirements do not warrant setting aside\n          a plea.   That is especially  true if the\n          defendant was not  misled or the omission\n          did not affect his decision.\n\n                    \n\n2.    The  cocaine had been taken  from defendant's apartment\nand placed in a car where it was seized. \n\n3.

Defendant never suggested that he did not  understand\n\nany  part of what was being said to  him or about him.  There\n\nwas no complaint about the competency of the interpreter.  We\n\nconclude that defendant's plea was knowing and voluntary.4\n\n                          Sentencing\n                                    \n\n          Defendant  claims that the  district court erred by\n\nfailing either  to inquire  directly of defendant  whether he\n\nhad  an opportunity  to  review and  discuss the  presentence\n\nreport,  or to  have the  record reflect  that defendant  and\n\ncounsel had an adequate opportunity for such review.  Neither\n\nclaim is supported by the record.\n\n                    \n\n4.    Because  of the context of this case, we see no need to\ndecide  whether the schoolyard  statute, 21 U.S.C.    860, is\nambiguous  and   whether  intent  to  distribute  within  the\nschoolyard  zone  has to  be  proven  by the  government,  or\nwhether it is irrelevant  or can be imputed to  the defendant\nso  long as he possesses an amount of illegal substances from\nwhich intent  to distribute may  reasonably be inferred.

Moreover, defendant has  not pointed out\n\nto us any inaccuracies in the presentence report.  This means\n\nthat  even if  there were an  error in  the manner  the court\n\nconducted the disposition hearing, and we have found none, it\n\nwould be harmless.\n\n     Affirmed.   \n     Affirmed.\n              \n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n</pre>",
