Miles,  Inc., invented  and\n                              \n\npatented a  pain-killing drug  called Xorphanol.   In  1984,\n\nMiles gave Pars Pharmaceutical Co. the \n\n          exclusive right throughout  the world to\n          make, have made, use and sell\n\nXorphanol,  in  return for  which  Pars  promised  to pay  a\n\nroyalty and\n\n          to  use reasonable  efforts directly  or\n          through  its  subcontractors  to develop\n          one or more compounds . . . to the point\n          of  [obtaining] . .  . government .  . .\n          approval   for  .   .  .   [Xorphanol's]\n          therapeutic use . . . .\n\nIn 1988,  Pars sublicensed  the plaintiff  in this  lawsuit,\n\nMaruho, Inc., to  develop Xorphanol \"compounds\" and  to sell\n\nthem in Japan.\n\n          According to  Maruho,  Pars misled  it during  the\n\nsublicense  negotiations.   Although  Maruho asked  Pars  to\n\nproduce all relevant studies, Pars  did not tell it about 1)\n\nan important  negative study  conducted by the  Charterhouse\n\nResearch Unit  of a well-known British  pharmaceutical firm,\n\nGlaxo,   Inc.,  and  2)  a  less  important  negative  study\n\nconducted by the Director of the Stanford Pain Clinic.  Both\n\nof these studies indicated that Xorphanol, while effectively\n\nreducing pain,  also caused  adverse side  effects, such  as\n\nheadaches, drowsiness, dizziness, and euphoria.  Maruho says\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nthat, had  it seen these  studies, it would not  have bought\n\nthe sublicense.  In its view, Pars is guilty of fraud.\n\n          Maruho, however, seems unlikely  to get its  money\n\nback  from Pars,  for Pars  is  in the  midst of  bankruptcy\n\nproceedings.   Maruho  instead  seeks  recovery from  Miles,\n\nXorphanol's  original  licensor;  and,  in this  (diversity-\n\nbased)  lawsuit against Miles, it pleads various theories of\n\nstate law.  The district court, after examining the evidence\n\nproffered by  the  parties,  granted  summary  judgment  for\n\nMiles.   Maruho  appeals.   We  affirm the  district court's\n\njudgment.\n\n                             I\n\n                Maruho's Procedural Argument\n                                            \n\n          At  the outset, Maruho  raises a procedural point.\n\nIt  says  that  the district  court  improperly  converted a\n\nmotion by Miles for judgment  on the pleadings, Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.  12(b)(6), into  a motion  for summary judgment,  Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56, without giving Maruho a \"reasonable opportunity\"\n\nto present \"pertinent  material.\" See Fed. R. Civ.  P. 12(b)\n                                     \n\n(court shall  treat motion  for judgment  on pleadings  as a\n\nmotion  for  summary  judgment  where  \"matters outside  the\n\npleading\" are  presented to  and accepted  by the  court and\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n\"reasonable opportunity\" to  present \"pertinent material\" is\n\n\"given\"). \n\n          The  record,  however, does  not  support Maruho's\n\nclaim.   Miles' motion  gave Maruho  adequate notice  of the\n\nrisk  of summary judgment, for Miles  entitled it \"Motion to\n\nDismiss  or,  in  the  Alternative,  for  Summary  Judgment\"\n                                                           \n\n(emphasis added).   We concede that Maruho  immediately told\n\nthe  court that it  thought Miles' motion  requested summary\n\njudgment on only one count.  But Maruho also told the court,\n                    \n\nin writing at the same time, that it would assume \"that  all\n                                                            \n\nof Miles' contentions  are asserted under both  Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.  12  and   [summary  judgment  rule]  56\"   (emphasis  in\n\noriginal).  Maruho then presented to the court three volumes\n\nof  documents, which it  titled \"Plaintiff  Summary Judgment\n\nRecord.\"  In  response to questioning by this  court at oral\n\nargument,  Maruho could not  identify any piece  of evidence\n\nthat it had  lacked the opportunity to submit.   Given these\n\ncircumstances, Maruho converted Miles'  motion into a motion\n                     \n\nfor summary judgment  on all counts by  presenting pertinent\n\nmaterial outside the pleadings; and Maruho not only had, but\n\nalso  took  advantage  of,  a  \"reasonable  opportunity\"  to\n\npresent all \"pertinent\"  material.  See In re  G.&amp; A. Books,\n                                                            \n\nInc., 770 F.2d 288, 294-95 (2d Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475\n                                                       \n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nU.S.  1015 (1986).  The district court was therefore legally\n\nentitled to treat Miles' motion  as one for summary judgment\n\non all counts.  \n\n                             II\n\n             Miles' Participation in the Fraud\n                                              \n\n          Maruho  argues that Miles  is liable as  an actual\n\nparticipant  in Pars' fraud, either by \"aiding and abetting\"\n\nPars'  fraud, by  acting  \"in  concert\"  with  Pars,  or  by\n\nengaging in an  \"unfair or deceptive act or  practice.\"  See\n                                                            \n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 95,   11; Kyte v. Philip Morris, Inc., 556\n                                                       \n\nN.E.2d  1025 (Mass. 1990);  Restatement (Second) of  Torts  \n                                                          \n\n876(a),  (b) (1979)  [hereinafter \"Restatement  (2d)\"].   It\n                                                    \n\nsays that, in the circumstances, a showing that Miles either\n\n1) actually  knew about the  fraud, or 2) should  have known\n                                                            \n\nabout the fraud,  is sufficient to trigger  Miles' liability\n\nas an actual participant.   We shall consider, in turn, each\n\nof the two branches of Maruho's argument.\n\n          1.   Actual  knowledge.    We  shall  assume,  for\n                                 \n\nargument's sake,  that a  finding that  Miles actually  knew\n\nabout  Pars'   fraud   would   trigger   Miles'   liability.\n\nNonetheless, like the district court, we do not believe  the\n\nrecord would permit a reasonable  juror to make that factual\n\nfinding.  \n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n          Maruho says that a juror might find Miles' \"actual\n\nknowledge\" by inferring, from Miles' conceded knowledge that\n\nMaruho  was willing  to pay $3  million for  the sublicense,\n\nthat  Miles  must have  known  that  Pars hid  the  negative\n\nXorphanol  studies from Maruho.  Otherwise, why would Maruho\n\npay so much for so little?   To make the inference, however,\n\nrequires  some kind  of  propositional  link,  such  as,  \"a\n\nknowledgeable firm would likely not have paid $3 million had\n\nit known about the studies.\"  The problem for Maruho is that\n\nthis link is missing.\n\n          We agree with Maruho that a reasonable juror could\n\nbelieve that Miles knew the following:\n\n          a.   After  obtaining its  license  in 1984,  Pars\n               sublicensed Glaxo,  Inc., a  highly reputable\n               British  firm,   to  prepare   Xorphanol  for\n               marketing.  In 1986, Glaxo, after paying Pars\n               more than  $1.5 million  for the  sublicense,\n               terminated the agreement.\n\n          b.   Glaxo  cancelled  the  sublicensing agreement\n               after its  Charterhouse Research  Unit tested\n               Xorphanol  by  giving ten  volunteers  single\n               doses (each in an amount growing from 0.25 mg\n               to 4.0 mg  over the course of  several days).\n               The  Charterhouse study  showed that  many of\n               these  volunteers  suffered  some significant\n               adverse side  effect not  suffered when  they\n               took a placebo.\n\n          c.   Earlier, in  1985, the  Director of  Stanford\n               Pain Clinic  had conducted a  multidose study\n               of Xorphanol, giving volunteers several doses\n               of 2 mg and 4 mg over several  days.  More of\n               these  volunteers  suffered  some significant\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\n               adverse side  effect than those  who received\n               comparable doses of codeine,  a commonly used\n               pain killer.\n\n          d.   After  Glaxo's 1986  termination, Maruho,  in\n               mid-1987,  agreed to pay  Pars $3 million for\n               Japanese sublicensing rights.\n\n          The record,  however,  also  shows  the  following\n\nfacts, which are not significantly disputed:\n\n          a.   Xorphanol  was  potentially a  very  valuable\n               product.  The market for pain killers amounts\n               to   several   billion    dollars   annually.\n               Xorphanol  seemed to  have  the pain  killing\n               properties of  a narcotic,  such as  codeine,\n               without  any  addictive quality.    Financial\n               newspapers   spoke   initially   of  expected\n               \"annual  worldwide\"  Xorphanol \"sales  of  at\n               least $50-100 million.\"  \n\n          b.   Miles,   after    receiving   \"updated    IND\n               information on Xorphanol,\" (which Maruho says\n               included  the   Stanford,  as  well   as  the\n               Charterhouse, studies),  wrote Pars  a letter\n               in which it basically accepted the  fact that\n               the  Charterhouse  study  was  negative,  but\n               nonetheless  pointed   to  other,   positive,\n               studies;  urged   Pars  to   perform  further\n               studies; noted the large sales of combination\n               and  other  pain killers;  and  concluded, in\n               reference to Xorphanol, that \"there is  still\n               a place  for  a moderate  to  strong,  orally\n               active,   non-dependence   producing\"    pain\n               killer.\n\n          c.   Other studies in the record show Xorphanol as\n               having highly desirable pain-killing effects,\n               with the frequency  of side effects depending\n               upon the study and the dose.  The studies all\n               make  clear  that  codeine  and  other   pain\n               killers  also have  side  effects, and  that,\n               since   many   of   the   side  effects   are\n               subjective, placebos have them as well.\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n          d.   The experts  differed about  the significance\n                                    \n               of the Charterhouse study,  with at least one\n               prominent expert  finding  that  it  was  not\n               critically  important  and  did  not  warrant\n               abandoning the Xorphanol project.   Dr. Louis\n               Lasagna, the Dean of Tufts University  School\n               of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, examined the\n               Charterhouse study and concluded that:\n\n               1)   \"[T]here  is  nothing  in  the\n                    Charterhouse   data   that  is\n                    disturbing about the  0.25 and\n                    0.5 mg doses,  and even at the\n                    1.0 and 2.0 mg doses, there is\n                    no   reason    for   excessive\n                    anxiety about adverse effects,\n                    if one compares the results on\n                    active drug  with the  results\n                    with placebo.\"\n\n               2)   \"There  is  nothing   in  this\n                    report,  in  my  opinion, that\n                    would  call  for   a  halt  to\n                    clinical testing  of Xorphanol\n                    at doses up to (and including)\n                    2 mg.\"\n\n               3)   \"In my view it is premature to\n                    make  a  judgment  as  to  the\n                    clinical utility and safety of\n                    this  drug in  the absence  of\n                    more clinical trial data.\"\n\n          The upshot is  a record that, even  when viewed in\n\nMaruho's  favor, shows  (1) a  product  potentially worth  a\n\ngreat deal of  money; (2) Miles'  belief, after learning  of\n\nthe negative studies, that Xorphanol was still valuable; (3)\n\nexperts (at  Glaxo) who thought that Xorphanol was not worth\n\ndeveloping;  but (4)  a respected  expert  who thought  that\n\nXorphanol  was still worth developing.  Had Maruho presented\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nfavorable  expert  testimony  on  the  relevant  question --\n\nwhether the hidden studies were conclusive to the point that\n\na  reasonable  pharmaceutical executive  would  have thought\n\nXorphanol had little or no value --- the jury might have had\n\na basis for reaching a favorable conclusion about what Miles\n\nknew.  But Maruho presented  no such expert testimony.  And,\n\nour  lay reading  of  the  record,  including  the  relevant\n\nstudies,  leads inexorably  to  the conclusion  that experts\n\ndiffered  in their views about Xorphanol's value, with Miles\n\nindisputedly arguing for further development.  That fact, in\n\nturn, means that Miles need  not have concluded, from the $3\n\nmillion payment,  that Pars  must have  hidden the  studies.\n\nAnd, a reasonable jury could not conclude that Miles in fact\n                                                            \n\nknew about Pars' misconduct.\n\n          2.  \"Should have known.\"  Maruho argues that Miles\n                                \n\nis  liable as  long as  it \"should  have known\"  about Pars'\n\nfraud.  The record, however, even when interpreted favorably\n\nto Maruho, supports  the factual part of this  claim only to\n\nthe point  where a  reasonable juror might  find that  Miles\n\nshould have  been suspicious --  and no further.   And, that\n\nfactual  finding does  not provide  sufficient  basis for  a\n\nlegal finding that Miles is  liable as an actual participant\n\nin the fraud. \n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\n          First,  insofar as  Maruho's \"actual  participant\"\n\ntheories  rest  upon a  tortfeasor's  intentional action,  a\n                                                 \n\nfinding about what Miles \"should have known\" is insufficient\n\nfor  a finding  of an  actual unlawful  intent, whether  one\n\ndefines  that \"intent\"  in  terms of  a  \"purpose\" or,  more\n\nbroadly,   as   a  \"belie[f]   that  the   consequences  are\n\nsubstantially   certain   to   result   from   [the   act].\"\n\nRestatement (2d)   8A (1965).  The Massachusetts courts have\n                \n\nmade clear that  a defendant \"aids  and abets\" a  tortfeasor\n\nonly  if, at the  least, the defendant  actually knows about\n                                                      \n\n\"its   substantial,   supporting   role   in   an   unlawful\n\nenterprise.\"   Kyte, 556  N.E.2d  at 1028.   Similarly,  the\n                   \n\nMassachusetts courts  have held  that a  defendant acts  \"in\n\nconcert\" with a tortfeasor only if the defendant \"agrees\" to\n\nwork toward the unlawful result.  See, e.g., id. at 1027-28;\n                                               \n\nGurney v. Tenney, 84 N.E.  428 (Mass. 1908).  Without actual\n                \n\nknowledge that  Pars was  hiding negative  tests, Miles  can\n\nneither  have  known  of Pars  unlawful  (i.e.,  fraudulent)\n\nobjective nor have agreed to help achieve it.\n\n          Second,  insofar  as  Maruho  tries  to  predicate\n\nliability upon Miles' negligence, a jury could find, at  the\n\nvery worst,  nothing more  than a  negligent failure  to act\n                                                    \n\nupon a suspicion, that is,  an omission on Miles' part.   To\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\npredicate tort liability upon a negligent omission, one must\n\nfind   a  special   relationship,   between  defendant   and\n\nplaintiff, that imposes  a duty upon  the defendant to  take\n\npositive  steps to protect  the plaintiff.   See Restatement\n                                                            \n\n(2nd)    291  comment f (negligent \"nonfeasance\"  requires a\n     \n\nspecial relationship), 314  &amp; comments a, c  (1965) (stating\n\nthe general rule that liability  for failure to take  action\n\nfor  the   aid  or  protection  of  another  is  limited  to\n\nsituations in which  there exists some  special relationship\n\nbetween the  parties).   We are not  aware of  any authority\n\nsuggesting      that      the       simple      relationship\n\n\"licensor/sublicensee\"  automatically,  by  itself,  creates\n             \n\nsuch a duty.  The  exceptional situations in which authority\n\nsupports the existence of such  a duty are not present here.\n\nSee id.    314A-324A (listing exceptions to the general rule\n      \n\nof  non-liability, none  of which encompasses  the licensor-\n\nsublicensee relationship).  Finally,  Maruho has not  argued\n\nany other ground  that might  support the  existence of  the\n\nnecessary  duty.  We therefore agree with the district court\n\nthat no such duty existed.\n\n          3.   Maruho argues that Miles has violated chapter\n\n93A  of the  Massachusetts General  Laws by  engaging in  an\n\n\"unfair or  deceptive act or  practice.\"  Mass. Gen.  L. ch.\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\n95,    11.   But,  to prove  a violation,  Maruho must  show\n\nconduct that involves  some kind of \"rascality.\"   Tagliente\n                                                            \n\nv. Himmer, 949 F.2d 1, 7 (1st  Cir. 1991).  Maruho has cited\n         \n\nno  authority that  would  justify such  a  finding where  a\n\nlicensor  has only  suspicion, not  actual  knowledge, of  a\n\nlicensee's improper conduct,  and where the licensor  has no\n\nduty  to  act  to  protect   the  potential  victim.     The\n\ncircumstances simply do not indicate \"rascal-like\"  behavior\n\non  Miles'  part.     We  therefore   do  not  believe   the\n\nMassachusetts courts would find a violation of the chapter.\n\n                            III\n\n                    Vicarious Liability\n                                       \n\n          Maruho  says that, even if Miles is without fault,\n\nit is  nonetheless \"vicariously\"  liable for  the harm  Pars\n\ncaused, either  because Pars  was Miles'  agent, or  because\n\nMiles and Pars were engaged  in a \"joint venture\" (or \"joint\n\nenterprise\").    The  theories of  vicarious  liability that\n\nMaruho  argues, however,  all require  Maruho  to show  that\n\nMiles  had  the  legal right  to  control  Pars' negotiating\n\nactivity.  See, e.g.,  Lyon v. The Ranger III, 858  F.2d 22,\n                                             \n\n27  (1st   Cir.   1988)  (joint   enterprise  exists   where\n\nparticipants \"'ha[ve] an  equal right to direct  and control\n\nthe conduct  of the  other[s] concerning  acts or  omissions\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nwhich  cause, or contribute  to the causation  of, injury.'\"\n\n(quoting Adams  v.

Yet Maruho can make  no\n                    \n\nsuch showing here.\n\n          The licensing agreement between Miles and Pars did\n\nnot give  Miles any right  to participate in or  control the\n\nnegotiation and  granting of  sublicenses.   And the  record\n\nprovides  no evidence of any  statement, or action, by Miles\n\nthat   suggests  any  right  to  control  Pars'  negotiating\n\nactivity.   We concede  that, sometimes,  a  jury might  use\n\nevidence  of  actual control  as a  basis for  inferring the\n\nexistence of a  corresponding legal right.  But  here, there\n\nwas no actual  control.  Miles did  not even know that  Pars\n\nand   Maruho  were  negotiating   a  sublicense   until  the\n\nnegotiations were already  roughly seven months old;  and it\n\nfirst learned the terms of  the proposed contract -- such as\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\nthe fee  Maruho was to pay for the  sublicense -- only a few\n\nweeks before the contract was scheduled to take effect.  \n\n          Maruho  nevertheless  argues   that  Miles'  legal\n\nability to  grant, or deny,  Pars a needed extension  of the\n\nbasic license permitted Miles to influence the terms  of, or\n\nto benefit from, the sublicense.   But, we have no reason to\n\nbelieve that  the  simple, unexercised,  practical power  to\n\ninfluence  a negotiation could, by itself, create an agency,\n\nor joint  venture  (or  enterprise),  for  otherwise,  every\n\nnegotiator  would discover himself the agent of, or venturer\n\nwith,  any  of the  many  persons  who might  influence  the\n\nnegotiations.   We are not  surprised that we could  find no\n\nlegal authority supporting such a  proposition.  We add that\n\nthe simple  fact that Miles  might have benefitted  from the\n\nsublicense  (through  the royalty-sharing  provision  in the\n\nMiles/Pars   license   agreement)   does  not   make   Miles\n\nvicariously  liable for Pars'  conduct.  See,  e.g., Payton,\n                                                           \n\n512 F.

The controversial part\n\nof this argument,  however, lies in its premise.   Did Miles\n\never receive a portion of the $3 million?\n\n          The  relevant facts are not in dispute.  Miles and\n\nPars disagreed about  whether Miles was entitled  to some of\n\nMaruho's $3  million sublicense fee.  Miles  argued that the\n\nfee was a \"royalty,\"  in which case it was  entitled to one-\n\nhalf.  Pars argued that  the entire sum represented a return\n\nof Xorphanol development  expenses, in which case  Miles was\n\nentitled to nothing.   Miles and Pars then  agreed that Pars\n\nwould deposit $1,350,000 of  the fee into an escrow  account\n\nand retain  the remainder.   The  escrow agreement  provided\n\nthat the money \"shall remain in escrow\" until  \n\n          a.  The Parties  . .  .  either reach  a\n          satisfactory  agreement  as  to  .  .  .\n          distribution; or\n\n          b.  A  final   decision  is  reached  by\n          arbitration . . .; or, \n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\n          c. In the event the Parties cannot agree\n          to arbitration, a final  decision on the\n          distribution .  . .  is  rendered by  an\n          appropriate court . . . .\n\nEventually,  Miles decided not  to bring a  legal proceeding\n\nand permitted Pars to take the money from escrow.     \n\n          For  Maruho to obtain \"restitution\" from Miles, it\n\nmust show,  at a minimum,  that Miles had \"possession  of or\n\nsome   other  interest  in\"  this  money.    Restatement  of\n                                                            \n\nRestitution    1  comment  b.   But  Miles  never  did  have\n           \n\npossession  of the money.  The  interest that it had (in the\n\nabsence  of an  agreement  from  Pars  as  to  distribution)\n\nconsisted of little more than a  right to bring a lawsuit to\n\nobtain money to which its legal right (the record indicates)\n\nwas highly uncertain.  And,  since Pars would not agree, the\n\nescrow served  only to  isolate and protect  the money  from\n\nother potential Pars creditors while  Miles made up its mind\n\nwhether or not to bring suit.\n\n          This kind of  interest -- at best  analogous to an\n\nattachment -- seems to us too slight to count as the kind of\n\nbenefit that  might support  a suit  for restitution.   This\n\nundefined interest is not analogous to that of a joint owner\n\nin a  joint bank account.  We can find no convincing analogy\n\nto any other kind of joint ownership.   Nor does the record,\n\nread favorably to  Miles, show anything of value  that Miles\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nreceived for releasing  the escrow.  (It shows  no \"promise\"\n\nby  Pars to  engage in  development work  that it  would not\n\notherwise  have undertaken.)   The  record  shows only  that\n\nMiles, for  a time, thought it had a  right to the money and\n\nconvinced Pars (in part through  its power to extend, or not\n\nto extend, the  basic license) to place the  money in escrow\n\nwhile Miles decided  whether or not  to sue.  (If  there was\n\nsome more  tangible interest here,  Maruho at least  had the\n\nburden of showing just what  it consisted of, but Maruho did\n\nnot even try to do  so.)  We are not surprised that we could\n\nfind  no authority supporting  the proposition that  such an\n\n\"interest\"  falls  within  the scope  of  the  Restatement's\n\ndescription  of   \"enrichment,\"  while  we   found  contrary\n\nauthority directly on point.

Both of these studies indicated that Xorphanol, while effectively reducing pain, also caused adverse side effects, such as headaches, drowsiness, dizziness, and euphoria.

It says that the district court improperly converted a motion by Miles for judgment on the pleadings, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), into a motion for summary judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, without giving Maruho a \"reasonable opportunity\" to present \"pertinent material.\"   See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (court shall treat motion for judgment on pleadings as a motion for summary judgment where \"matters outside the pleading\" are presented to and accepted by the court and \"reasonable opportunity\" to present \"pertinent material\" is \"given\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record, however, does not support Maruho's claim.  Miles' motion gave Maruho adequate notice of the risk of summary judgment, for Miles entitled it \"Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment \" (emphasis added).  We concede that Maruho immediately told the court that it thought Miles' motion requested summary judgment on only one count.  But Maruho also told the court, in writing at the same time, that it would assume \"that all of Miles' contentions are asserted under both Fed.R.Civ.P. 12 and [summary judgment rule] 56\" (emphasis in original).  Maruho then presented to the court three volumes of documents, which it titled \"Plaintiff Summary Judgment Record.\"   In response to questioning by this court at oral argument, Maruho could not identify any piece of evidence that it had lacked the opportunity to submit.  Given these circumstances, Maruho converted Miles' motion into a motion for summary judgment on all counts by presenting pertinent material outside the pleadings;  and Maruho not only had, but also took advantage of, a \"reasonable opportunity\" to present all \"pertinent\" material.

The district court was therefore legally entitled to treat Miles' motion as one for summary judgment on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Miles' Participation in the Fraud</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maruho argues that Miles is liable as an actual participant in Pars' fraud, either by \"aiding and abetting\" Pars' fraud, by acting \"in concert\" with Pars, or by engaging in an \"unfair or deceptive act or practice.\"   See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A, Sec. 11;  Kyte v. Philip Morris, Inc., 408 Mass. 162, 556 N.E.2d 1025 (1990);  Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 876(a), (b) (1979) [hereinafter \"Restatement (2d) \"].  It says that, in the circumstances, a showing that Miles either 1) actually knew about the fraud, or 2) should have known about the fraud, is sufficient to trigger Miles' liability as an actual participant.  We shall consider, in turn, each of the two branches of Maruho's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Actual knowledge.   We shall assume, for argument's sake, that a finding that Miles actually knew about Pars' fraud would trigger Miles' liability.  Nonetheless, like the district court, we do not believe the record would permit a reasonable juror to make that factual finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maruho says that a juror might find Miles' \"actual knowledge\" by inferring, from Miles' conceded knowledge that Maruho was willing to pay $3 million for the sublicense, that Miles must have known that Pars hid the negative Xorphanol studies from Maruho.  Otherwise, why would Maruho pay so much for so little?   To make the inference, however, requires some kind of propositional link, such as, \"a knowledgeable firm would likely not have paid $3 million had it known about the studies.\"   The problem for Maruho is that this link is missing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Maruho that a reasonable juror could believe that Miles knew the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.  After obtaining its license in 1984, Pars sublicensed Glaxo, Inc., a highly reputable British firm, to prepare Xorphanol for marketing.  In 1986, Glaxo, after paying Pars more than $1.5 million for the sublicense, terminated the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Glaxo cancelled the sublicensing agreement after its Charterhouse Research Unit tested Xorphanol by giving ten volunteers single doses (each in an amount growing from 0.25 mg to 4.0 mg over the course of several days).  The Charterhouse study showed that many of these volunteers suffered some significant adverse side effect not suffered when they took a placebo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Earlier, in 1985, the Director of Stanford Pain Clinic had conducted a multidose study of Xorphanol, giving volunteers several doses of 2 mg and 4 mg over several days.  More of these volunteers suffered some significant adverse side effect than those who received comparable doses of codeine, a commonly used pain killer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. After Glaxo's 1986 termination, Maruho, in mid-1987, agreed to pay Pars $3 million for Japanese sublicensing rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record, however, also shows the following facts, which are not significantly disputed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.  Xorphanol was potentially a very valuable product.  The market for pain killers amounts to several billion dollars annually.  Xorphanol seemed to have the pain killing properties of a narcotic, such as codeine, without any addictive quality.  Financial newspapers spoke initially of expected \"annual worldwide\" Xorphanol \"sales of at least $50-100 million.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Miles, after receiving \"updated IND information on Xorphanol,\" (which Maruho says included the Stanford, as well as the Charterhouse, studies), wrote Pars a letter in which it basically accepted the fact that the Charterhouse study was negative, but nonetheless pointed to other, positive, studies;  urged Pars to perform further studies;  noted the large sales of combination and other pain killers;  and concluded, in reference to Xorphanol, that \"there is still a place for a moderate to strong, orally active, non-dependence producing\" pain killer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Other studies in the record show Xorphanol as having highly desirable pain-killing effects, with the frequency of side effects depending upon the study and the dose.  The studies all make clear that codeine and other pain killers also have side effects, and that, since many of the side effects are subjective, placebos have them as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. The experts differed about the significance of the Charterhouse study, with at least one prominent expert finding that it was not critically important and did not warrant abandoning the Xorphanol project.  Dr. Louis Lasagna, the Dean of Tufts University School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, examined the Charterhouse study and concluded that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>1) \"[T]here is nothing in the Charterhouse data that is disturbing about the 0.25 and 0.5 mg doses, and even at the 1.0 and 2.0 mg doses, there is no reason for excessive anxiety about adverse effects, if one compares the results on active drug with the results with placebo.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>2) \"There is nothing in this report, in my opinion, that would call for a halt to clinical testing of Xorphanol at doses up to (and including) 2 mg.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>3) \"In my view it is premature to make a judgment as to the clinical utility and safety of this drug in the absence of more clinical trial data.\"The upshot is a record that, even when viewed in Maruho's favor, shows (1) a product potentially worth a great deal of money;  (2) Miles' belief, after learning of the negative studies, that Xorphanol was still valuable;  (3) experts (at Glaxo) who thought that Xorphanol was not worth developing;  but (4) a respected expert who thought that Xorphanol was still worth developing.  Had Maruho presented favorable expert testimony on the relevant question--whether the hidden studies were conclusive to the point that a reasonable pharmaceutical executive would have thought Xorphanol had little or no value--the jury might have had a basis for reaching a favorable conclusion about what Miles knew.  But Maruho presented no such expert testimony.  And, our lay reading of the record, including the relevant studies, leads inexorably to the conclusion that experts differed in their views about Xorphanol's value, with Miles indisputedly arguing for further development.  That fact, in turn, means that Miles need not have concluded, from the $3 million payment, that Pars must have hidden the studies.  And, a reasonable jury could not conclude that Miles in fact knew about Pars' misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  \"Should have known.\"   Maruho argues that Miles is liable as long as it \"should have known\" about Pars' fraud.  The record, however, even when interpreted favorably to Maruho, supports the factual part of this claim only to the point where a reasonable juror might find that Miles should have been suspicious--and no further.  And, that factual finding does not provide sufficient basis for a legal finding that Miles is liable as an actual participant in the fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, insofar as Maruho's \"actual participant\" theories rest upon a tortfeasor's intentional action, a finding about what Miles \"should have known\" is insufficient for a finding of an actual unlawful intent, whether one defines that \"intent\" in terms of a \"purpose\" or, more broadly, as a \"belie[f] that the consequences are substantially certain to result from [the act].\"  Restatement (2d) Sec. 8A (1965).  The Massachusetts courts have made clear that a defendant \"aids and abets\" a tortfeasor only if, at the least, the defendant actually knows about \"its substantial, supporting role in an unlawful enterprise.\"  Kyte, 556 N.E.2d at 1028.   Similarly, the Massachusetts courts have held that a defendant acts \"in concert\" with a tortfeasor only if the defendant \"agrees\" to work toward the unlawful result.  See, e.g., id. at 1027-28;  Gurney v. Tenney, 197 Mass. 457, 84 N.E. 428 (1908).  Without actual knowledge that Pars was hiding negative tests, Miles can neither have known of Pars unlawful (i.e., fraudulent) objective nor have agreed to help achieve it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, insofar as Maruho tries to predicate liability upon Miles' negligence, a jury could find, at the very worst, nothing more than a negligent failure to act upon a suspicion, that is, an omission on Miles' part.  To predicate tort liability upon a negligent omission, one must find a special relationship, between defendant and plaintiff, that imposes a duty upon the defendant to take positive steps to protect the plaintiff.  See Restatement (2nd) Secs. 291 comment f (negligent \"nonfeasance\" requires a special relationship), 314 &amp; comments a, c (1965) (stating the general rule that liability for failure to take action for the aid or protection of another is limited to situations in which there exists some special relationship between the parties).  We are not aware of any authority suggesting that the simple relationship \"licensor/sub licensee\" automatically, by itself, creates such a duty.  The exceptional situations in which authority supports the existence of such a duty are not present here.  See id. Secs. 314A-324A (listing exceptions to the general rule of non-liability, none of which encompasses the licensor-sublicensee relationship).  Finally, Maruho has not argued any other ground that might support the existence of the necessary duty.  We therefore agree with the district court that no such duty existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  Maruho argues that Miles has violated chapter 93A of the Massachusetts General Laws by engaging in an \"unfair or deceptive act or practice.\"   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A, Sec. 11.  But, to prove a violation, Maruho must show conduct that involves some kind of \"rascality.\"  Tagliente v. Himmer, 949 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1991).  Maruho has cited no authority that would justify such a finding where a licensor has only suspicion, not actual knowledge, of a licensee's improper conduct, and where the licensor has no duty to act to protect the potential victim.  The circumstances simply do not indicate \"rascal-like\" behavior on Miles' part.  We therefore do not believe the Massachusetts courts would find a violation of the chapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Vicarious Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maruho says that, even if Miles is without fault, it is nonetheless \"vicariously\" liable for the harm Pars caused, either because Pars was Miles' agent, or because Miles and Pars were engaged in a \"joint venture\" (or \"joint enterprise\").  The theories of vicarious liability that Maruho argues, however, all require Maruho to show that Miles had the legal right to control Pars' negotiating activity.  See, e.g., Lyon v. The Ranger III, 858 F.2d 22, 27 (1st Cir.1988) (joint enterprise exists where participants \" 'ha[ve] an equal right to direct and control the conduct of the other[s] concerning acts or omissions which cause, or contribute to the causation of, injury.' \"  (quoting Adams v. Dunton, 284 Mass. 63, 187 N.E. 90, 92 (1933));  Payton v. Abbott Labs, 512 F.Supp. 1031, 1036 (D.Mass.1981) (joint venture requires \"joint [but not necessarily equal] control of the objectives of the undertaking and of the means of achieving those objectives\");  Restatement (Second) of Agency Sec. 1 comments a, b (1958);  W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts Sec. 72, at 519-20 (5th ed. 1984) (joint enterprise requires something that shows a mutual right of control).  Yet Maruho can make no such showing here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The licensing agreement between Miles and Pars did not give Miles any right to participate in or control the negotiation and granting of sublicenses.  And the record provides no evidence of any statement, or action, by Miles that suggests any right to control Pars' negotiating activity.  We concede that, sometimes, a jury might use evidence of actual control as a basis for inferring the existence of a corresponding legal right.  But here, there was no actual control.  Miles did not even know that Pars and Maruho were negotiating a sublicense until the negotiations were already roughly seven months old;  and it first learned the terms of the proposed contract--such as the fee Maruho was to pay for the sublicense--only a few weeks before the contract was scheduled to take effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maruho nevertheless argues that Miles' legal ability to grant, or deny, Pars a needed extension of the basic license permitted Miles to influence the terms of, or to benefit from, the sublicense.  But, we have no reason to believe that the simple, unexercised, practical power to influence a negotiation could, by itself, create an agency, or joint venture (or enterprise), or otherwise, every negotiator would discover himself the agent of, or venturer with, any of the many persons who might influence the negotiations.  We are not surprised that we could find no legal authority supporting such a proposition.  We add that the simple fact that Miles might have benefitted from the sublicense (through the royalty-sharing provision in the Miles/Pars license agreement) does not make Miles vicariously liable for Pars' conduct.  See, e.g., Payton, 512 F.Supp. at 1036 (recognizing that profit sharing and joint control are central to a joint venture);  Stock v. Fife, 13 Mass.App.Ct. 75, 430 N.E.2d 845, 847-48 (1982) (absent joint control, a common (pecuniary) interest is not enough to establish a joint enterprise).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <p>Unjust Enrichment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maruho argues that Miles was \"unjustly enriched\" by having received a share of the $3 million sublicense fee, and that it must therefore \"return\" the share to Maruho.  See Restatement of Restitution Sec. 1 (1937) (\"A person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution to the other.\").  The controversial part of this argument, however, lies in its premise.  Did Miles ever receive a portion of the $3 million?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts are not in dispute.  Miles and Pars disagreed about whether Miles was entitled to some of Maruho's $3 million sublicense fee.  Miles argued that the fee was a \"royalty,\" in which case it was entitled to one-half.  Pars argued that the entire sum represented a return of Xorphanol development expenses, in which case Miles was entitled to nothing.  Miles and Pars then agreed that Pars would deposit $1,350,000 of the fee into an escrow account and retain the remainder.  The escrow agreement provided that the money \"shall remain in escrow\" until</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>a.  The Parties ... either reach a satisfactory agreement as to ... distribution;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>b. A final decision is reached by arbitration ...;  or,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>c. In the event the Parties cannot agree to arbitration, a final decision on the distribution ... is rendered by an appropriate court....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Miles decided not to bring a legal proceeding and permitted Pars to take the money from escrow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For Maruho to obtain \"restitution\" from Miles, it must show, at a minimum, that Miles had \"possession of or some other interest in\" this money.  Restatement of Restitution Sec. 1 comment b.  But Miles never did have possession of the money.  The interest that it had (in the absence of an agreement from Pars as to distribution) consisted of little more than a right to bring a lawsuit to obtain money to which its legal right (the record indicates) was highly uncertain.  And, since Pars would not agree, the escrow served only to isolate and protect the money from other potential Pars creditors while Miles made up its mind whether or not to bring suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This kind of interest--at best analogous to an attachment--seems to us too slight to count as the kind of benefit that might support a suit for restitution.  This undefined interest is not analogous to that of a joint owner in a joint bank account.  We can find no convincing analogy to any other kind of joint ownership.  Nor does the record, read favorably to Miles, show anything of value that Miles received for releasing the escrow.  (It shows no \"promise\" by Pars to engage in development work that it would not otherwise have undertaken.)   The record shows only that Miles, for a time, thought it had a right to the money and convinced Pars (in part through its power to extend, or not to extend, the basic license) to place the money in escrow while Miles decided whether or not to sue.  (If there was some more tangible interest here, Maruho at least had the burden of showing just what it consisted of, but Maruho did not even try to do so.)   We are not surprised that we could find no authority supporting the proposition that such an \"interest\" falls within the scope of the Restatement's description of \"enrichment,\" while we found contrary authority directly on point.  Gilpin v. AFSCME, AFL-CIO, 875 F.2d 1310, 1314-15 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 917, 110 S.Ct. 278, 107 L.Ed.2d 258 (1989).  The authority that Maruho cites, Gill Equipment Co. v. Freedman, 339 Mass. 303, 158 N.E.2d 863 (1959), says that a person may be \"unjustly enriched\" by money that he does \"possess\" under a constructive trust created by his promise to assume \"personal responsibility, \" which trust he violates by later giving the money to another.  That case is not on point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons the judgment of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Although Maruho asked Pars to produce all relevant studies, Pars did not tell it about 1) an important negative study conducted by the Charterhouse Research Unit of a well-known British pharmaceutical firm, Glaxo, Inc., and 2) a less important negative study conducted by the Director of the Stanford Pain Clinic.  Both of these studies indicated that Xorphanol, while effectively reducing pain, also caused adverse side effects, such as headaches, drowsiness, dizziness, and euphoria.  Maruho says that, had it seen these studies, it would not have bought the sublicense.  In its view, Pars is guilty of fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maruho, however, seems unlikely to get its money back from Pars, for Pars is in the midst of bankruptcy proceedings.  Maruho instead seeks recovery from Miles, Xorphanol's original licensor;  and, in this (diversity-based) lawsuit against Miles, it pleads various theories of state law.  The district court, after examining the evidence proffered by the parties, granted summary judgment for Miles.  Maruho appeals.  We affirm the district court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>* Maruho's Procedural Argument</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, Maruho raises a procedural point.  It says that the district court improperly converted a motion by Miles for judgment on the pleadings, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), into a motion for summary judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, without giving Maruho a \"reasonable opportunity\" to present \"pertinent material.\"   See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (court shall treat motion for judgment on pleadings as a motion for summary judgment where \"matters outside the pleading\" are presented to and accepted by the court and \"reasonable opportunity\" to present \"pertinent material\" is \"given\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record, however, does not support Maruho's claim.  Miles' motion gave Maruho adequate notice of the risk of summary judgment, for Miles entitled it \"Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment \" (emphasis added).  We concede that Maruho immediately told the court that it thought Miles' motion requested summary judgment on only one count.  But Maruho also told the court, in writing at the same time, that it would assume \"that all of Miles' contentions are asserted under both Fed.R.Civ.P. 12 and [summary judgment rule] 56\" (emphasis in original).  Maruho then presented to the court three volumes of documents, which it titled \"Plaintiff Summary Judgment Record.\"   In response to questioning by this court at oral argument, Maruho could not identify any piece of evidence that it had lacked the opportunity to submit.  Given these circumstances, Maruho converted Miles' motion into a motion for summary judgment on all counts by presenting pertinent material outside the pleadings;  and Maruho not only had, but also took advantage of, a \"reasonable opportunity\" to present all \"pertinent\" material.

Philip Morris, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2098846\"><a href=\"/opinion/2098846/kyte-v-philip-morris-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2098846\"><a href=\"/opinion/2098846/kyte-v-philip-morris-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1025</span></a></span> (1990);  Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 876(a), (b) (1979) [hereinafter \"Restatement (2d) \"].  It says that, in the circumstances, a showing that Miles either 1) actually knew about the fraud, or 2) should have known about the fraud, is sufficient to trigger Miles' liability as an actual participant.  We shall consider, in turn, each of the two branches of Maruho's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Actual knowledge.   We shall assume, for argument's sake, that a finding that Miles actually knew about Pars' fraud would trigger Miles' liability.  Nonetheless, like the district court, we do not believe the record would permit a reasonable juror to make that factual finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maruho says that a juror might find Miles' \"actual knowledge\" by inferring, from Miles' conceded knowledge that Maruho was willing to pay $3 million for the sublicense, that Miles must have known that Pars hid the negative Xorphanol studies from Maruho.  Otherwise, why would Maruho pay so much for so little?   To make the inference, however, requires some kind of propositional link, such as, \"a knowledgeable firm would likely not have paid $3 million had it known about the studies.\"   The problem for Maruho is that this link is missing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Maruho that a reasonable juror could believe that Miles knew the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.  After obtaining its license in 1984, Pars sublicensed Glaxo, Inc., a highly reputable British firm, to prepare Xorphanol for marketing.  In 1986, Glaxo, after paying Pars more than $1.5 million for the sublicense, terminated the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Glaxo cancelled the sublicensing agreement after its Charterhouse Research Unit tested Xorphanol by giving ten volunteers single doses (each in an amount growing from 0.25 mg to 4.0 mg over the course of several days).  The Charterhouse study showed that many of these volunteers suffered some significant adverse side effect not suffered when they took a placebo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Earlier, in 1985, the Director of Stanford Pain Clinic had conducted a multidose study of Xorphanol, giving volunteers several doses of 2 mg and 4 mg over several days.  More of these volunteers suffered some significant adverse side effect than those who received comparable doses of codeine, a commonly used pain killer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. After Glaxo's 1986 termination, Maruho, in mid-1987, agreed to pay Pars $3 million for Japanese sublicensing rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record, however, also shows the following facts, which are not significantly disputed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.  Xorphanol was potentially a very valuable product.  The market for pain killers amounts to several billion dollars annually.  Xorphanol seemed to have the pain killing properties of a narcotic, such as codeine, without any addictive quality.  Financial newspapers spoke initially of expected \"annual worldwide\" Xorphanol \"sales of at least $50-100 million.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Miles, after receiving \"updated IND information on Xorphanol,\" (which Maruho says included the Stanford, as well as the Charterhouse, studies), wrote Pars a letter in which it basically accepted the fact that the Charterhouse study was negative, but nonetheless pointed to other, positive, studies;  urged Pars to perform further studies;  noted the large sales of combination and other pain killers;  and concluded, in reference to Xorphanol, that \"there is still a place for a moderate to strong, orally active, non-dependence producing\" pain killer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Other studies in the record show Xorphanol as having highly desirable pain-killing effects, with the frequency of side effects depending upon the study and the dose.  The studies all make clear that codeine and other pain killers also have side effects, and that, since many of the side effects are subjective, placebos have them as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. The experts differed about the significance of the Charterhouse study, with at least one prominent expert finding that it was not critically important and did not warrant abandoning the Xorphanol project.  Dr. Louis Lasagna, the Dean of Tufts University School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, examined the Charterhouse study and concluded that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>1) \"[T]here is nothing in the Charterhouse data that is disturbing about the 0.25 and 0.5 mg doses, and even at the 1.0 and 2.0 mg doses, there is no reason for excessive anxiety about adverse effects, if one compares the results on active drug with the results with placebo.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>2) \"There is nothing in this report, in my opinion, that would call for a halt to clinical testing of Xorphanol at doses up to (and including) 2 mg.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>3) \"In my view it is premature to make a judgment as to the clinical utility and safety of this drug in the absence of more clinical trial data.\"The upshot is a record that, even when viewed in Maruho's favor, shows (1) a product potentially worth a great deal of money;  (2) Miles' belief, after learning of the negative studies, that Xorphanol was still valuable;  (3) experts (at Glaxo) who thought that Xorphanol was not worth developing;  but (4) a respected expert who thought that Xorphanol was still worth developing.  Had Maruho presented favorable expert testimony on the relevant question--whether the hidden studies were conclusive to the point that a reasonable pharmaceutical executive would have thought Xorphanol had little or no value--the jury might have had a basis for reaching a favorable conclusion about what Miles knew.  But Maruho presented no such expert testimony.  And, our lay reading of the record, including the relevant studies, leads inexorably to the conclusion that experts differed in their views about Xorphanol's value, with Miles indisputedly arguing for further development.  That fact, in turn, means that Miles need not have concluded, from the $3 million payment, that Pars must have hidden the studies.  And, a reasonable jury could not conclude that Miles in fact knew about Pars' misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  \"Should have known.\"   Maruho argues that Miles is liable as long as it \"should have known\" about Pars' fraud.  The record, however, even when interpreted favorably to Maruho, supports the factual part of this claim only to the point where a reasonable juror might find that Miles should have been suspicious--and no further.  And, that factual finding does not provide sufficient basis for a legal finding that Miles is liable as an actual participant in the fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, insofar as Maruho's \"actual participant\" theories rest upon a tortfeasor's intentional action, a finding about what Miles \"should have known\" is insufficient for a finding of an actual unlawful intent, whether one defines that \"intent\" in terms of a \"purpose\" or, more broadly, as a \"belie[f] that the consequences are substantially certain to result from [the act].\"  Restatement (2d) Sec. 8A (1965).  The Massachusetts courts have made clear that a defendant \"aids and abets\" a tortfeasor only if, at the least, the defendant actually knows about \"its substantial, supporting role in an unlawful enterprise.\"  Kyte, 556 N.E.2d at 1028.   Similarly, the Massachusetts courts have held that a defendant acts \"in concert\" with a tortfeasor only if the defendant \"agrees\" to work toward the unlawful result.  See, e.g., id. at 1027-28;  Gurney v. Tenney, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></span> (1908).  Without actual knowledge that Pars was hiding negative tests, Miles can neither have known of Pars unlawful (i.e., fraudulent) objective nor have agreed to help achieve it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, insofar as Maruho tries to predicate liability upon Miles' negligence, a jury could find, at the very worst, nothing more than a negligent failure to act upon a suspicion, that is, an omission on Miles' part.  To predicate tort liability upon a negligent omission, one must find a special relationship, between defendant and plaintiff, that imposes a duty upon the defendant to take positive steps to protect the plaintiff.  See Restatement (2nd) Secs. 291 comment f (negligent \"nonfeasance\" requires a special relationship), 314 &amp; comments a, c (1965) (stating the general rule that liability for failure to take action for the aid or protection of another is limited to situations in which there exists some special relationship between the parties).  We are not aware of any authority suggesting that the simple relationship \"licensor/sub licensee\" automatically, by itself, creates such a duty.  The exceptional situations in which authority supports the existence of such a duty are not present here.  See id. Secs. 314A-324A (listing exceptions to the general rule of non-liability, none of which encompasses the licensor-sublicensee relationship).  Finally, Maruho has not argued any other ground that might support the existence of the necessary duty.  We therefore agree with the district court that no such duty existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  Maruho argues that Miles has violated chapter 93A of the Massachusetts General Laws by engaging in an \"unfair or deceptive act or practice.\"   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93A, Sec. 11.  But, to prove a violation, Maruho must show conduct that involves some kind of \"rascality.\"  Tagliente v. Himmer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572162\"><a href=\"/opinion/572162/teresa-tagliente-trustee-of-the-tagliente-family-trust-v-david-c-himmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1991).  Maruho has cited no authority that would justify such a finding where a licensor has only suspicion, not actual knowledge, of a licensee's improper conduct, and where the licensor has no duty to act to protect the potential victim.  The circumstances simply do not indicate \"rascal-like\" behavior on Miles' part.  We therefore do not believe the Massachusetts courts would find a violation of the chapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Vicarious Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maruho says that, even if Miles is without fault, it is nonetheless \"vicariously\" liable for the harm Pars caused, either because Pars was Miles' agent, or because Miles and Pars were engaged in a \"joint venture\" (or \"joint enterprise\").  The theories of vicarious liability that Maruho argues, however, all require Maruho to show that Miles had the legal right to control Pars' negotiating activity.  See, e.g., Lyon v. The Ranger III, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512375\"><a href=\"/opinion/512375/helen-grenier-lyon-etc-v-the-ranger-iii-and-gerald-j-costa-helen/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.1988) (joint enterprise exists where participants \" 'ha[ve] an equal right to direct and control the conduct of the other[s] concerning acts or omissions which cause, or contribute to the causation of, injury.' \"  (quoting Adams v. Dunton, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></span>, 92 (1933));  Payton v. Abbott Labs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2300202\"><a href=\"/opinion/2300202/payton-v-abbott-labs/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1031</span></a></span>, 1036 (D.Mass.1981) (joint venture requires \"joint [but not necessarily equal] control of the objectives of the undertaking and of the means of achieving those objectives\");  Restatement (Second) of Agency Sec. 1 comments a, b (1958);  W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts Sec. 72, at 519-20 (5th ed. 1984) (joint enterprise requires something that shows a mutual right of control).  Yet Maruho can make no such showing here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The licensing agreement between Miles and Pars did not give Miles any right to participate in or control the negotiation and granting of sublicenses.  And the record provides no evidence of any statement, or action, by Miles that suggests any right to control Pars' negotiating activity.  We concede that, sometimes, a jury might use evidence of actual control as a basis for inferring the existence of a corresponding legal right.  But here, there was no actual control.  Miles did not even know that Pars and Maruho were negotiating a sublicense until the negotiations were already roughly seven months old;  and it first learned the terms of the proposed contract--such as the fee Maruho was to pay for the sublicense--only a few weeks before the contract was scheduled to take effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maruho nevertheless argues that Miles' legal ability to grant, or deny, Pars a needed extension of the basic license permitted Miles to influence the terms of, or to benefit from, the sublicense.  But, we have no reason to believe that the simple, unexercised, practical power to influence a negotiation could, by itself, create an agency, or joint venture (or enterprise), or otherwise, every negotiator would discover himself the agent of, or venturer with, any of the many persons who might influence the negotiations.  We are not surprised that we could find no legal authority supporting such a proposition.  We add that the simple fact that Miles might have benefitted from the sublicense (through the royalty-sharing provision in the Miles/Pars license agreement) does not make Miles vicariously liable for Pars' conduct.  See, e.g., Payton, 512 F.Supp. at 1036 (recognizing that profit sharing and joint control are central to a joint venture);  Stock v. Fife, 13 Mass.App.Ct. 75, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2024930\"><a href=\"/opinion/2024930/stock-v-fife/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">845</span></a></span>, 847-48 (1982) (absent joint control, a common (pecuniary) interest is not enough to establish a joint enterprise).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <p>Unjust Enrichment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maruho argues that Miles was \"unjustly enriched\" by having received a share of the $3 million sublicense fee, and that it must therefore \"return\" the share to Maruho.  See Restatement of Restitution Sec. 1 (1937) (\"A person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution to the other.\").  The controversial part of this argument, however, lies in its premise.  Did Miles ever receive a portion of the $3 million?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts are not in dispute.  Miles and Pars disagreed about whether Miles was entitled to some of Maruho's $3 million sublicense fee.  Miles argued that the fee was a \"royalty,\" in which case it was entitled to one-half.  Pars argued that the entire sum represented a return of Xorphanol development expenses, in which case Miles was entitled to nothing.  Miles and Pars then agreed that Pars would deposit $1,350,000 of the fee into an escrow account and retain the remainder.  The escrow agreement provided that the money \"shall remain in escrow\" until</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>a.  The Parties ... either reach a satisfactory agreement as to ... distribution;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>b. A final decision is reached by arbitration ...;  or,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>c. In the event the Parties cannot agree to arbitration, a final decision on the distribution ... is rendered by an appropriate court....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Miles decided not to bring a legal proceeding and permitted Pars to take the money from escrow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For Maruho to obtain \"restitution\" from Miles, it must show, at a minimum, that Miles had \"possession of or some other interest in\" this money.  Restatement of Restitution Sec. 1 comment b.  But Miles never did have possession of the money.  The interest that it had (in the absence of an agreement from Pars as to distribution) consisted of little more than a right to bring a lawsuit to obtain money to which its legal right (the record indicates) was highly uncertain.  And, since Pars would not agree, the escrow served only to isolate and protect the money from other potential Pars creditors while Miles made up its mind whether or not to bring suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This kind of interest--at best analogous to an attachment--seems to us too slight to count as the kind of benefit that might support a suit for restitution.  This undefined interest is not analogous to that of a joint owner in a joint bank account.  We can find no convincing analogy to any other kind of joint ownership.  Nor does the record, read favorably to Miles, show anything of value that Miles received for releasing the escrow.  (It shows no \"promise\" by Pars to engage in development work that it would not otherwise have undertaken.)   The record shows only that Miles, for a time, thought it had a right to the money and convinced Pars (in part through its power to extend, or not to extend, the basic license) to place the money in escrow while Miles decided whether or not to sue.  (If there was some more tangible interest here, Maruho at least had the burden of showing just what it consisted of, but Maruho did not even try to do so.)   We are not surprised that we could find no authority supporting the proposition that such an \"interest\" falls within the scope of the Restatement's description of \"enrichment,\" while we found contrary authority directly on point.
