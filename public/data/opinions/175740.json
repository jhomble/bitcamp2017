Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                       Boudin, Selya and Gajarsa,*\n\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Kevin J. Fitzgerald, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for\nappellant.\n     Milind M. Shah, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nPeter F. Neronha, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          September 22, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f             SELYA, Circuit Judge.       The Sex Offender Registration and\n\nNotification Act (SORNA), Pub. L. No. 109-248, tit. I, §§ 101-155,\n\n120 Stat. 587, 590-611 (2006), fashioned a national scheme for the\n\nregistration of sex offenders.          This appeal requires us to decide\n\na question about that scheme that has divided the courts of\n\nappeals:     When    did    SORNA's    registration            requirements      become\n\noperative with respect to a previously convicted sex offender who\n\ntraveled     interstate     and     failed    to    register       between      SORNA's\n\neffective date and the promulgation of an interim rule clarifying\n\nSORNA's     reach?         After    determining          that    the   registration\n\nrequirements became generally operative at the time when SORNA was\n\nsigned into law and rejecting a series of constitutional challenges\n\nto the registration scheme, we affirm the defendant's conviction\n\nfor failure to register.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n             Because this appeal follows a conviction predicated on a\n\nguilty plea, we draw the facts from the change-of-plea colloquy,\n\nthe uncontested portions of the presentence investigation report,\n\nand   the   sentencing     transcript.        See,       e.g.,   United    States    v.\n\nCintrón-Echautegui, 604 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2010); United States v.\n\nDietz, 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n             Defendant-appellant Michael DiTomasso was convicted of\n\nsex offenses in Massachusetts in 1995.                    Upon his release from\n\nprison,     Massachusetts     law    required      him    to    register   as    a   sex\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\foffender, and he did so.      He was on notice that, if he moved out of\n\nstate, he would have to register as a sex offender in the new\n\nvenue.\n\n            The defendant kept his Massachusetts registration current\n\nthrough the fall of 2006.          In February of 2007, he moved to\n\nWoonsocket, Rhode Island,1 and took up residence there.              Despite\n\nthis change of domicile, he did not register as a sex offender in\n\nRhode Island.\n\n            On March 27, 2007, a local police officer informed the\n\ndefendant that Rhode Island law required him to register.                 The\n\nofficer told him that he should report to the police station for\n\nthat purpose within the week.       The defendant did not comply.\n\n            On April 4, 2007, the defendant was arrested for failing\n\nto register as a sex offender in Rhode Island.            Spurred by this\n\narrest, a federal grand jury handed up an indictment charging the\n\ndefendant with failing to register under SORNA.                See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2250; 42 U.S.C. § 16913.           The indictment alleged that the\n\ndefendant's culpable failure to register began in March 2007 and\n\ncontinued   through   April   4,   2007   (a   period   that   followed   his\n\ninterstate travel in February of 2007).\n\n            The defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing\n\nthat SORNA did not apply to him and that, in all events, the law's\n\n\n     1\n       The record does not indicate an exact date, but the\ngovernment, at least provisionally, acknowledges that the\ndefendant's interstate travel occurred before February 27, 2007.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fregistration requirements were invalid. The government opposed the\n\nmotion. The district court, in a thoughtful rescript, rejected the\n\ndefendant's challenge. United States v. DiTomasso, 552 F. Supp. 2d\n\n233, 248 (D.R.I. 2008).      The court ruled that SORNA applied to the\n\ndefendant from and after its effective date because the law imposed\n\na \"general obligation on sex offenders to register.\"               Id. at 241.\n\nThe court simultaneously rebuffed the defendant's other challenges.\n\nId. at 247-48.\n\n             The defendant elected to enter a conditional guilty plea,\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2), preserving his right to appeal the\n\ndenial of his motion to dismiss.        The district court sentenced him\n\nto serve thirty months in prison.           This timely appeal ensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n             We first consider the defendant's principal argument that\n\nSORNA did not apply to him when he committed the alleged offense.\n\nWe then address his other constitutional claims.\n\n        A.    Applicability of the Registration Requirements.\n\n             The defendant pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2250(a).       Among other things, this section imposes criminal\n\npenalties when a person required to register as a sex offender\n\nunder   SORNA    knowingly   fails    to    register    after     traveling   in\n\ninterstate commerce.      For SORNA purposes, a \"sex offender\" is \"an\n\nindividual    who   was   convicted   of    a   sex   offense.\"      42   U.S.C.\n\n§ 16911(1).      The defendant concedes that he falls within this\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\ftaxonomy.    To understand his argument that SORNA's registration\n\nrequirements, 42 U.S.C. § 16913(a), (c), nonetheless do not apply\n\nto him, we must understand the architecture of the statutory\n\nscheme.\n\n            The registration requirements are laid out in section\n\n16913, which provides:\n\n            (a) In general\n\n            A sex offender shall register, and keep the\n            registration current, in each jurisdiction\n            where the offender resides, where the offender\n            is an employee, and where the offender is a\n            student.   For initial registration purposes\n            only, a sex offender shall also register in\n            the jurisdiction in which convicted if such\n            jurisdiction    is    different    from    the\n            jurisdiction of residence.\n\n            (b) Initial registration\n\n            The sex offender shall initially register —\n\n            (1)   before   completing  a   sentence   of\n            imprisonment with respect to the offense\n            giving rise to the registration requirement;\n            or\n\n            (2) not later than 3 business days after being\n            sentenced for that offense, if the sex\n            offender is not sentenced to a term of\n            imprisonment.\n\n            (c) Keeping the registration current\n\n            A sex offender shall, not later than 3\n            business days after each change of name,\n            residence, employment, or student status,\n            appear in person in at least 1 jurisdiction\n            involved pursuant to subsection (a) and inform\n            that jurisdiction of all changes in the\n            information required for that offender in the\n            sex offender registry.      That jurisdiction\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          shall immediately provide that information to\n          all other jurisdictions in which the offender\n          is required to register.\n\n          (d) Initial registration of sex offenders\n          unable to comply with subsection (b)\n\n          The Attorney General shall have the authority\n          to   specify    the  applicability   of   the\n          requirements of this subchapter to sex\n          offenders convicted before the enactment of\n          this chapter or its implementation in a\n          particular jurisdiction, and to prescribe\n          rules for the registration of any such sex\n          offenders and for other categories of sex\n          offenders who are unable to comply with\n          subsection (b).\n\n42 U.S.C. § 16913.2\n\n          SORNA became law on July 27, 2006. On February 28, 2007,\n\nthe Attorney General, acting pursuant to the authority explicitly\n\ngranted to him in section 16913(d), promulgated an interim rule \"to\n\neliminate any possible uncertainty about the applicability of\n\n[SORNA's] requirements . . . to sex offenders whose predicate\n\nconvictions predate the enactment of SORNA.\"   Applicability of the\n\nSex Offender Registration and Notification Act, 72 Fed. Reg. 8894,\n\n8896 (Feb. 28, 2007). This rule declares that SORNA's requirements\n\n\"apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of\n\n\n     2\n       There is a discrepancy between the United States Code and\nthe United States Code Annotated with respect to the language of 42\nU.S.C. § 16913.    The version printed in the United States Code\nAnnotated contains the words \"of this section\" in subsections (c)\nand (d) when cross-referencing other subsections of the provision,\nbut the version printed in the United States Code does not. We\nquote here the version in the United States Code, as it is the\nofficial version of the statute. This difference, however, has\nabsolutely no bearing on the substance of our discussion.\n\n                               -6-\n\fthe   offense   for   which    registration   is     required   prior    to   the\n\nenactment of [SORNA].\"        28 C.F.R. § 72.3.\n\n           The courts of appeals have disagreed about the meaning\n\nand effect of this statutory/regulatory mosaic. See Carr v. United\n\nStates, 130 S. Ct. 2229, 2234 n.2 (2010) (noting circuit split).\n\nThe disagreement centers on subsection (d), which contains two\n\npertinent clauses.      The question boils down to whether the first\n\nclause,   stating     that    \"[t]he   Attorney    General    shall    have   the\n\nauthority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this\n\nsubchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this\n\nchapter or its implementation in a particular jurisdiction,\" gave\n\nthe Attorney General authority to determine the applicability of\n\nSORNA to all persons who stood convicted of sex offenses on SORNA's\n\neffective date or, alternatively, as indicated in the following\n\nclause of subsection (d) (\"to prescribe rules for the registration\n\nof any such sex offenders and for other categories of sex offenders\n\nwho are unable to comply with subsection (b)\"), to determine its\n\napplicability only as to specific subsets of those offenders.\n\n           Some     courts     have    determined,    often     over    emphatic\n\ndissents, that the statute unambiguously gave the Attorney General\n\nthe authority to determine SORNA's applicability to all persons\n\npreviously convicted of sex offenses.         See, e.g., United States v.\n\nCain, 583 F.3d 408, 414-15 (6th Cir. 2009); United States v.\n\nHatcher, 560 F.3d 222, 228 (4th Cir. 2009); United States v.\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fMadera, 528 F.3d 852, 858 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam).                 If this\n\nview is correct, SORNA did not apply to previously convicted sex\n\noffenders until the Attorney General promulgated the interim rule.\n\nSee Hatcher, 560 F.3d at 229.\n\n            Other      courts,    deeming    the   statute    ambiguous,       have\n\nconstrued    it   to    signify    that   the   Attorney     General    only    had\n\nauthority    to     determine     SORNA's    applicability      to     previously\n\nconvicted sex offenders who were unable initially to register under\n\nSORNA.3   See, e.g., United States v. Hinckley, 550 F.3d 926, 930,\n\n932-33, 935 (10th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 2383 (2009);\n\nUnited States v. May, 535 F.3d 912, 918-19 (8th Cir. 2008), cert.\n\ndenied, 129 S. Ct. 2431 (2009); see also Cain, 583 F.3d at 424\n\n(Griffin, J., dissenting); Hatcher, 560 F.3d at 229 (Shedd, J.,\n\ndissenting).      Under this view, registered sex offenders who had a\n\nstate-law duty to keep their registrations current on SORNA's\n\neffective date became subject to a new obligation to register for\n\nfederal purposes when, thereafter, they moved to a different state.\n\nSee May, 535 F.3d at 919.         If this view is correct, SORNA applied\n\nto previously convicted sex offenders as of the date of its\n\nenactment.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       An example would be an offender who had been convicted of a\nsex offense but was not required to register (or could not\nregister) under any state law prior to SORNA's enactment. See 72\nFed. Reg. at 8896.\n\n                                       -8-\n\f            The defendant urges us to follow the Fourth, Sixth, and\n\nEleventh Circuits and hold that SORNA's registration requirements\n\ndid not apply to him when he traveled interstate.            In his view, the\n\nplain language of subsection (d) delegates to the Attorney General\n\nsole authority to determine whether SORNA applies to any or all sex\n\noffenders   with     preexisting   convictions      and,   inasmuch   as   the\n\nAttorney General did not exercise this authority until February 28,\n\n2007   (when    he   promulgated   the    interim   rule),    convicted    sex\n\noffenders who traveled before that date and failed to register did\n\nnot violate SORNA's registration requirements.             Any other reading\n\nof the statute, he contends, would transgress the Ex Post Facto\n\nClause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 3, which prohibits \"punishment\n\nfor an act which was not punishable at the time it was committed.\"\n\nWeaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 28 (1981) (quoting Cummings v.\n\nMissouri, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277, 325-26 (1867)).                Because this\n\nclaim presents a question of statutory construction, we afford de\n\nnovo review.     United States v. Leahy, 473 F.3d 401, 405 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n            \"Statutory interpretation begins with the language of the\n\nstatute.\"      Ruiz v. Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp., 496 F.3d 1,\n\n8 (1st Cir. 2007).       Absent some indication that the words of a\n\nstatute have an \"exotic meaning,\" we normally assume that the\n\nlanguage employed carries its usual and ordinary meaning.             SEC v.\n\nTambone, 597 F.3d 436, 442 (1st Cir. 2010) (en banc).                 If the\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fmeaning of the text is plain, we generally need go no further.                   In\n\nre Hill, 562 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n          This general rule, like virtually every general rule,\n\nadmits of exceptions.       One such exception is pertinent here.                No\n\nless an authority than the Supreme Court has warned that \"the\n\nmeaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context.\"\n\nHolloway v. United States, 526 U.S. 1, 7 (1999) (quoting Brown v.\n\nGardner, 513 U.S. 115, 118 (1994)); see also Davis v. Mich. Dep't\n\nof Treas., 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989) (\"[W]ords of a statute must be\n\nread in their context and with a view to their place in the overall\n\nstatutory scheme.\").\n\n          The    language    at   issue      here   —    the    first   clause   of\n\nsubsection (d) — states that \"[t]he Attorney General shall have the\n\nauthority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this\n\nsubchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this\n\nchapter . . . .\"      42 U.S.C. § 16913(d).             Although this language\n\nmight appear straightforward if read in a vacuum, a mechanical\n\nreading of it as applying to all previously convicted sex offenders\n\nwould wrest it from its contextual moorings.               Taking into account\n\nthe context in which this provision operates, we do not believe\n\nthat such a mechanical construction is what Congress intended.\n\n          In    our   judgment,   a    different        canon   of   construction\n\ndominates the interpretive landscape in this instance.                       When\n\ncongressional intent is clear and a statute plausibly can be read\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fto effectuate that intent, that reading must prevail over a more\n\nsemantically correct reading of the statutory language. See, e.g.,\n\nIn re Hill, 562 F.3d at 32 (\"[P]lain meaning sometimes must yield\n\nif its application would bring about results that are either absurd\n\nor antithetical to Congress's discernible intent.\").               We explain\n\nbelow why we think that this is such a case.\n\n            In the absence of a clear congressional direction to the\n\ncontrary — and there is none here — \"a law takes effect on the date\n\nof its enactment.\"     Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395,\n\n404   (1991).    SORNA   was   signed     into   law   on   July   27,   2006.\n\nSubsection (a), which requires that sex offenders \"register, and\n\nkeep the registration current,\" 42 U.S.C. § 16913(a), unarguably\n\nbecame law at that time.    The same is true of subsection (b), which\n\ndescribes    SORNA's     initial   registration        requirements,       id.\n\n§ 16913(b), and of subsection (c), which demands the updating of\n\nregistration information within three business days of a change of\n\nname, residence, employment, or student status, id. § 16913(c).\n\nThus, but for subsection (d), any argument that the section cannot\n\noperate in advance of action by the Attorney General would be\n\nabsurd.\n\n            Based on this analysis, we disagree with the Sixth\n\nCircuit's reading of subsections (a)-(c).          See Cain, 583 F.3d at\n\n414-15 (\"Congress did not enact language providing a default\n\nposition . . . the statute does not read 'the Attorney General\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fshall   have   the   authority   to    waive   the   applicability       of   the\n\nrequirements of this subchapter.'\"). Subsections (a), (b), and (c)\n\ncontain clear and directory language, and when statutory language\n\nis written as a clear directive, the rule is that, in the absence\n\nof limiting language, the statute is effective as of the date of\n\nits enactment. See United States v. Shenandoah, 595 F.3d 151, 157-\n\n58 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3433 (2010).                There is no\n\nlimiting language here.\n\n            Subsection (d) is anything but a clear direction to the\n\ncontrary.    Courts holding otherwise have read the language of this\n\nsubsection as giving the Attorney General the exclusive authority\n\nto apply the registration requirements to any and all previously\n\nconvicted sex offenders.     See, e.g., Hatcher, 560 F.3d at 227.              To\n\narrive at this interpretation, those courts have surgically removed\n\nsubsection (d) from the rest of the section and have read its text\n\nin a vacuum.    See, e.g., Cain, 583 F.3d at 414.           We are unwilling\n\nto take so struthious an approach.           Cf. United States v. Heirs of\n\nBoisdore, 49 U.S. (8 How.) 113, 122 (1849) (explaining that \"[i]n\n\nexpounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or\n\nmember of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law,\n\nand to its object and policy\").         Context must be considered — and\n\ncontextual awareness is especially important when interpreting the\n\nprovisions of a comprehensive regulatory scheme. See, e.g., FDA v.\n\nBrown   &   Williamson   Tobacco   Corp.,      529   U.S.   120,   133   (2000)\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f(directing courts to interpret such a statute \"as a symmetrical and\n\ncoherent regulatory scheme\" (quoting Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513\n\nU.S. 561, 569 (1995))).              Congress intended SORNA to function as\n\nsuch a scheme.     See 42 U.S.C. § 16901 (stating that Congress sought\n\nto    \"establish[]    a        comprehensive         national     system        for    the\n\nregistration of [sex] offenders\"); see also May, 535 F.3d at 919-20\n\n(discussing Congressional intent to create regulatory scheme when\n\nenacting SORNA).\n\n           When viewed as a part of a seamless regulatory scheme,\n\nsubsection   (d)    has    a       distinct    office:    it    appears    to    reflect\n\nCongress's    recognition            that     specific     applications         of     the\n\nregistration requirements to previously convicted sex offenders may\n\nhave unintended consequences.               Thus, subsection (d) allows — but\n\ndoes not compel — the Attorney General to narrow SORNA's sweep if\n\nand to the extent that he concludes that specific situations invite\n\nsuch narrowing.      Several contextual considerations support this\n\nview.\n\n           First, it cannot be gainsaid that Congress enacted SORNA\n\nto    \"establish[]    a        comprehensive         national     system        for    the\n\nregistration of [sex] offenders.\"                   42 U.S.C. § 16901.           The Act\n\ndefines a \"sex offender\" as \"an individual who was convicted of a\n\nsex   offense.\"      Id.       §    16911(1)       (emphasis   supplied).         It   is\n\nsignificant that this past-tense definition makes no exceptions.\n\nSee Hatcher, 560 F.3d at 232 (Shedd, J., dissenting) (concluding\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\fthat   this    past-tense     usage    \"expressly     sweeps   persons    .    .   .\n\nconvicted of sex offenses prior to SORNA's enactment within the\n\nstatute's scope\"); see also Carr, 130 S. Ct. at 2236 (noting\n\nimportance of Congress's choice of verb tense in interpreting\n\nstatute's temporal reach).\n\n              Second, the structure of section 16913 strongly suggests\n\nthat this past-tense usage is not a scrivener's error.              The office\n\nof   subsection    (a)   is   to   ensure     the   registration   of    all   sex\n\noffenders.       Congress spoke with conspicuous clarity in making\n\nsubsection (a) all-encompassing: \"A sex offender shall register,\n\nand keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the\n\noffender resides . . . .\"             42 U.S.C. § 16913(a).        By the same\n\ntoken,   neither     subsection       (b),    which   elaborates   on    initial\n\nregistration requirements, nor subsection (c), which delineates\n\ncontinuing registration requirements, distinguishes between pre-\n\nSORNA and post-SORNA sex offense convictions.             See id. § 16913(b)-\n\n(c); see also Hinckley, 550 F.3d at 944 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).\n\n              Third, SORNA was tailored to fashion a comprehensive\n\nregulatory scheme.       42 U.S.C. § 16901.         Construing subsection (d)\n\nto exempt a broad swath of the convicted sex offender population —\n\nindeed, the entirely of it, until the Attorney General acts — would\n\nfit uncomfortably with the remainder of the Act.\n\n              Fourth, the title of subsection (d) specifies that the\n\nauthority it describes relates to the \"[i]nitial registration of\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fsex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b).\" This language\n\nclearly indicates that the scope of the authority conferred upon\n\nthe Attorney General by subsection (d) is limited to prescribing\n\nrules governing those offenders unable to comply with SORNA's\n\ninitial registration requirements under subsection (b) and not pre-\n\nSORNA sex offenders more generally. See Hinckley, 550 F.3d at 933.\n\n           Some   of    the    courts    that   have   endorsed   a   contrary\n\nconstruction of subsection (d) have disregarded the title of the\n\nsubsection based on the principle that courts only look to the\n\ntitle of a law in the event of ambiguity.              See, e.g., Cain, 583\n\nF.3d at 416; Hatcher, 560 F.3d at 226.          But that principle does not\n\npertain where, as here, an inquiring court's primary task is to\n\nplace a statute in context before attempting to construe it. Thus,\n\nwe do not use the title to \"undo or limit what the text makes\n\nplain.\"   Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v. Balt. & Ohio R.R. Co., 331 U.S.\n\n519, 529 (1947).\n\n           Fifth, the language of the second clause of subsection\n\n(d),   which   states   that    the     Attorney   General   shall    have   the\n\nauthority \"to prescribe rules . . . for other categories of sex\n\noffenders who are unable to comply with subsection (b),\" informs\n\nour understanding of the first clause of subsection (d).                     The\n\nsecond clause suggests that the authority conferred by the first\n\nclause of subsection (d) was intended to extend only to those\n\npreviously convicted offenders who were unable to comply with\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fsubsection (b), and not to previously convicted offenders more\n\ngenerally.     The use of the word \"other\" in the second clause is\n\nmost naturally read to indicate Congress's contemplation that the\n\n\"sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter\"\n\nreferenced in the first clause will form one subset of \"offenders\n\nunable to comply with subsection (b).\"           Cf. United States v. Ven-\n\nFuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"All words and\n\nprovisions of statutes are intended to have meaning and are to be\n\ngiven effect, and no construction should be adopted which would\n\nrender   statutory   words    or    phrases    meaningless,     redundant   or\n\nsuperfluous.\"). This interpretation of the interaction between the\n\ntwo clauses of subsection (d) leaves intact the registration\n\nrequirements    articulated    in    subsection     (a)   and    limits     the\n\napplicability of subsection (d) to those offenders unable to comply\n\nwith the requirements of subsection (b). See Hinckley, 550 F.3d at\n\n932.\n\n           Sixth, and finally, our view of the scope of subsection\n\n(d) is informed by the way in which Congress chose to delegate\n\nauthority to the Attorney General.            The subsection provides that\n\nthe Attorney General \"shall have the authority\" to determine the\n\napplicability of the requirements imposed by SORNA.                42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 16913(d).    It is thus apparent that the drafters eschewed the use\n\nof mandatory language (e.g., \"shall determine\") that would have\n\ncompelled the Attorney General to make an affirmative determination\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fbefore the statute could be applied to any previously convicted sex\n\noffender.      In its use of permissive language, subsection (d)\n\ndiffers from other SORNA provisions in which Congress mandated\n\naction   by    the   Attorney   General.      See,   e.g.,     id.   §   16917(b)\n\n(directing that \"the Attorney General shall prescribe rules for the\n\nnotification of sex offenders\"). Congress's decision to couch some\n\nprovisions of the statute in mandatory language but to couch\n\nsubsection (d) in discretionary language is a telltale sign.4                 See\n\nDuncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 172-74 (2001).           We think that this\n\nlanguage says what it means and means what is says: that the\n\nAttorney General does not have to act before SORNA's registration\n\nrequirements     become   effective    as    to   previously    convicted    sex\n\noffenders.     See Shenandoah, 595 F.3d at 157-58.\n\n              Congress obviously knew how to direct action by the\n\nAttorney General and how to give discretionary authority to him.\n\nIn drafting subsection (d), Congress chose the latter course.                 We\n\nregard this choice as deliberate and, thus, as favoring a reading\n\nof subsection (d) as a grant to the Attorney General of discretion\n\n\n     4\n       We note that the phrase \"shall have the authority\" is\ntypically used, elsewhere in the United States Code, to denote a\ngrant of authority to perform a discretionary act. See, e.g., 6\nU.S.C. § 112(b)(2) (stating that Secretary of Homeland Security\n\"shall have the authority to make contracts\"); 12 U.S.C.\n§ 3907(a)(2) (stating that federal banking regulators \"shall have\nthe authority\" to set minimum capital requirements); 16 U.S.C.\n§ 459j-2(d) (stating that Secretary of the Interior \"shall have the\nauthority\" to condemn property); see also Cain, 583 F.3d at 427-30\n(Griffin, J., dissenting) (cataloguing judicial interpretations of\nsimilar discretionary provisions).\n\n                                      -17-\n\fto provide limited relief from the broad requirements imposed by\n\nSORNA in order to account for problematic permutations that might\n\narise with respect to some previously convicted sex offenders.\n\n              These lampposts light the path that we must follow.         The\n\nlanguage, structure, and purpose of subsection (d) and the context\n\nin which it operates combine to show its unambiguous meaning.             We\n\nhold that, in framing subsection (d), Congress did not contemplate\n\na statutory scheme in which the application of the general rules\n\nlimned in subsections (a), (b), and (c) to previously convicted sex\n\noffenders would hinge on action by the Attorney General.5\n\n              For purposes of the case at hand, this holding gets the\n\ngrease from the goose. It teaches that the general rules requiring\n\nupdates to sex offender registration took effect when SORNA was\n\nsigned into law.      Those requirements were thus in full force when,\n\nin February of 2007, the defendant traveled to a new state.              When\n\nhe   failed    to   register   there,   he   violated   federal   law.    His\n\nprosecution for that offense poses no Ex Post Facto concerns.6\n\n\n      5\n       The interim rule promulgated by the Attorney General\nindicates that this interpretation is correct.  It states that\n\"[t]his rule forecloses\" claims that the Attorney General must\nfirst act before SORNA applies. 72 Fed. Reg. at 8896 (emphasis\nsupplied).\n      6\n       The defendant argues only that his prosecution under SORNA\nviolated the Ex Post Facto Clause because it penalized him for\nconduct (interstate travel) that occurred prior to the date that\nSORNA applied to him. He does not raise the related, but distinct,\nclaim that the overall applicability of SORNA presents an Ex Post\nFacto Clause problem because SORNA imposes punishment for a\npreexisting crime. We therefore do not address this second issue\n\n                                    -18-\n\f                                 B.   Other Claims.\n\n              The defendant advances two other arguments.             First, he\n\nmaintains that Congress lacked power under the Commerce Clause to\n\nenact       sex    offender     registration    requirements.       Second,   he\n\nasseverates that his conviction infringes his rights under the Due\n\nProcess Clause because it was impossible for him to comply with\n\nSORNA at the time of his interstate travel.7                We address these\n\narguments         separately,    mindful   of    our   obligation    to   review\n\nconstitutional challenges de novo.             United States v. Volungus, 595\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n              1.     Commerce Clause.      The Commerce Clause provides in\n\npertinent part that \"[t]he Congress shall have Power To . . .\n\nregulate Commerce . . . among the several States.\"                  U.S. Const.\n\nart. I, § 8.           The Supreme Court has described the extent of\n\nCongress's power to legislate under the Commerce Clause as follows:\n\n              [W]e have identified three broad categories of\n              activity that Congress may regulate under its\n              commerce power. First, Congress may regulate\n              the use of the channels of interstate\n              commerce.   Second, Congress is empowered to\n\n\nhere.\n        7\n       In supplemental briefing, the defendant tried to raise a\nfurther argument: that the Attorney General's promulgation of the\ninterim rule violated the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C.\n§ 553. This argument was available to the defendant when he filed\nhis opening brief (indeed, he made it below), so it falls within\nthe familiar rule that issues not advanced in an appellant's\nopening brief are deemed waived. See United States v. Vázquez-\nRivera, 407 F.3d 476, 487-88 (1st Cir. 2005); Sandstrom v. ChemLawn\nCorp., 904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                        -19-\n\f            regulate and protect the instrumentalities of\n            interstate commerce, or persons or things in\n            interstate commerce, even though the threat\n            may come only from intrastate activities.\n            Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes\n            the power to regulate those activities having\n            a substantial relation to interstate commerce,\n            i.e., those activities that substantially\n            affect interstate commerce.\n\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 558-59 (1995) (internal\n\ncitations omitted).\n\n            Keying to this test, the defendant launches an as-applied\n\nchallenge.   He argues that SORNA does not regulate the channels or\n\ninstrumentalities     of,    persons   in,   or   activities    having   a\n\nsubstantial effect on, interstate commerce.             See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 608-09, 613 (2000); Lopez, 514\n\nU.S. at 558-59.      This argument fails because SORNA, as applied\n\nhere, explicitly regulates the use of the channels of, and persons\n\nin, interstate commerce.          Interstate travel is, after all, an\n\nexpress element of the SORNA violation with which the defendant was\n\ncharged   and   of   which   he   stands   convicted.     See   18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 2250(a)(2)(B).     That is all that is needed to satisfy the Lopez\n\nstandard.    See United States v. Guzman, 591 F.3d 83, 89-91 (2d\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3487 (2010); Shenandoah, 595 F.3d\n\nat 160-61; United States v. Zuniga, 579 F.3d 845, 850 (8th Cir.\n\n2009) (per curiam), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3384 (2010).            Given\n\nthe presence of this element, the statute has a sufficient nexus to\n\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\finterstate commerce to survive the defendant's Commerce Clause\n\nchallenge.8\n\n            2.    Due Process.     The defendant's final argument is\n\nstate-specific.     He contends that because Rhode Island had not\n\n\"implemented\" SORNA at the time that he traveled interstate, he\n\ncould not have complied with the law's registration requirements.\n\nTherefore, his conviction trespasses upon his right to due process.\n\n            We   need   not   tarry.    Although   this   \"impossibility\"\n\nargument is new to us in this context, it has been uniformly\n\nrejected elsewhere.      See, e.g., United States v. Hester, 589 F.3d\n\n86, 92 (2d Cir. 2009) (per curiam), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 2137\n\n(2010); United States v. Griffey, 589 F.3d 1363, 1366 (11th Cir.\n\n2009) (per curiam), cert. denied. 130 S. Ct. 3290 (2010); United\n\nStates v. Gould, 568 F.3d 459, 463-65 (4th Cir. 2009), cert.\n\ndenied, 130 S. Ct. 1686 (2010).        We join that queue, pausing only\n\nto offer a decurtate statement of our reasoning.\n\n            SORNA contains commands aimed at two different audiences:\n\nconvicted sex offenders and states.       Convicted sex offenders must\n\nregister.     See 42 U.S.C. § 16913.    States must take various steps,\n\n\n     8\n       The defendant suggests that the registration requirement\ncontained in 42 U.S.C. § 16913 itself exceeds Congress's power\nunder the Commerce Clause.    This suggestion is incorrect.     The\nNecessary and Proper Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 18,\nprovides Congress with ample authority to regulate local activity\nas part of a general scheme regulating interstate commerce. See,\ne.g., Guzman, 591 F.3d at 91; United States v. Whaley, 577 F.3d\n254, 260-61 (5th Cir. 2009); United States v. Ambert, 561 F.3d\n1202, 1211-12 (11th Cir. 2009); see also Volungus, 595 F.3d at 5-6.\n\n                                   -21-\n\fsuch as maintaining a jurisdiction-wide sex offender registry,\n\nenacting criminal penalties for failures to register, and sharing\n\ninformation with other registries.              See, e.g., id. §§ 16912(a),\n\n16913(e), 16921(b). A state's failure to take these steps may lead\n\nto a loss of federal funds.           See id. § 16925(a); Gould, 568 F.3d at\n\n463   n.1.     Of   critical      importance,      however,    the   registration\n\nrequirements for sex offenders are neither conditioned on nor\n\nharnessed     to    state    implementation      of    SORNA's   state-directed\n\nmandates.\n\n             In any event, by the time that Congress enacted SORNA,\n\nevery state had a sex offender registration law in place.                    See\n\nSmith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 90 (2003).                    SORNA's registration\n\nrequirements do not contemplate a specific type of registration;\n\nthey merely require a sex offender to \"register . . . in each\n\njurisdiction where the offender resides.\"                42 U.S.C. § 16913(a).\n\nRegistration in accordance with a preexisting state sex offender\n\nregistration law satisfies SORNA.              See Griffey, 589 F.3d at 1366\n\n(collecting cases).\n\n             This construct makes good sense given SORNA's office as\n\na mechanism for identifying sex offenders who otherwise might slip\n\nthrough      the    cracks      and   elude    state-by-state        registration\n\nrequirements by moving across state lines.              See 42 U.S.C. § 16901;\n\nsee also National Guidelines for Sex Offender Registration and\n\nNotification,       73   Fed.    Reg.    38,030,      38,030   (July   2,   2008)\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\f(explaining that SORNA was enacted to \"eliminate potential gaps and\n\nloopholes under the pre-existing standards by means of which sex\n\noffenders could attempt to evade registration requirements\").   The\n\nresult is that, as long as a state maintains a registration\n\nmechanism for sex offenders, what the state does or does not do\n\nwith respect to implementing its state-specific obligations under\n\nSORNA is not relevant to a sex offender's obligation to register.\n\nSee Gould, 568 F.3d at 465.\n\n            This dichotomy creates no unfairness here.     Although\n\nRhode Island may not have fully complied with its responsibilities\n\nunder SORNA at the time of the defendant's federal crime, it did\n\nmaintain a sex offender registry. The defendant could — and should\n\n— have registered there, as local police directed him to do.     It\n\nfollows that there was no due process violation.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe uphold the district court's well-reasoned refusal to dismiss the\n\nindictment.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                    - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f           BOUDIN,     Circuit   Judge,    concurring.    Judge   Selya's\n\ndecision for the panel lays out lucidly the reasons why the\n\nstatutory language and canons of construction--always the first\n\nresort in interpretation--support applying the statute to the\n\ndefendant. It may be useful to underscore two further points: that\n\nthe statute's design leans against the narrow reading adopted by\n\nseveral other circuits and that Congress' purpose supports the\n\nbroader one that we adopt today.\n\n           National standards for sex offender registration have\n\nexisted since 1994, when the Congress provided federal funding to\n\nstates that enacted sex offender registration laws.        See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 14071.     By the time that the Sex Offender Registration and\n\nNotification Act (SORNA), Pub. L. No. 109-248, tit. I, 120 Stat.\n\n590 (42 U.S.C. § 16901 et seq.), was signed into law on July 27,\n\n2006, every state--including Massachusetts and Rhode Island--had\n\nenacted a sex offender registration law.        See National Guidelines\n\nfor Sex Offender Registration and Notification, 73 Fed. Reg.\n\n38,030, 38,030 (July 2, 2008); see also Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84,\n\n90 (2003).\n\n           But   the    pre-SORNA   state-by-state    schemes   contained\n\npotential gaps and loopholes through which sex offenders could\n\nattempt to evade registration requirements or the consequences of\n\nregistration violations.     See H.R. Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, at 23.\n\nSenator Cantwell explained: \"Child sex offenders have exploited\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fthis stunning lack of uniformity, and the consequences have been\n\ntragic.    Twenty percent of the Nation's 560,000 sex offenders are\n\n'lost' because State offender registry programs are not coordinated\n\nwell enough.\"          152 Cong. Rec. S8020 (daily ed. July 20, 2006).\n\nSORNA's aim, repeated throughout the debate in Congress, was to\n\nimpose    on    this    patchwork     a    uniform,     \"comprehensive\"           federal\n\nregistration statute.            See 42 U.S.C. § 16901; see also United\n\nStates v. Hinckley, 550 F.3d 926, 947 (10th Cir. 2008) (Gorsuch,\n\nJ., concurring).\n\n               SORNA pressed states--on pain of losing federal funding--\n\nto   adopt      new    federal     standards      in   their    own    sex      offender\n\nregistration programs.             42 U.S.C. § 16925.             In addition, it\n\ndirectly     imposed     new     federal    registration       obligations        on   sex\n\noffenders       and     provided     for     federal     enforcement         of    those\n\nobligations.         42 U.S.C. §§ 16913-16917.         What is important to the\n\ncase before us is that Congress intended the enforcement provisions\n\nto apply of their own force to those who had previously been\n\nconvicted and not just to newly convicted offenders.\n\n               The    House   Judiciary     Committee    report       on   an     earlier\n\nversion of SORNA explained that SORNA would address the \"strong\n\npublic interest in finding\" previously convicted offenders who were\n\nnot currently registered \"and having them register with current\n\ninformation to mitigate the risks of additional crimes against\n\nchildren.\"        H.R. Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, at 24.                       Similarly,\n\n\n                                           -25-\n\fSenator Kyl explained: \"There currently are over 100,000 sex\n\noffenders in this country who are required to register but are 'off\n\nthe system.'   They are not registered.   The penalties in this bill\n\nshould be adequate to ensure that these individuals register.\" 152\n\nCong. Rec. S8025 (daily ed. July 20, 2006) (emphasis added); accord\n\nid. at S8013 (Sen. Hatch).\n\n          Consonantly, the SORNA provision on registry requirements\n\nfor sex offenders has a single opening paragraph, titled \"In\n\ngeneral,\" that directs all \"sex offender[s]\" to register and to\n\nkeep their registration current, 42 U.S.C. § 16913(a), and SORNA\n\ndefines the term sex offender as \"an individual who was convicted\n\nof a sex offender,\" id. § 16911(1) (emphasis added).     Subsection\n\n(a), without exempting offenders with convictions before SORNA came\n\ninto force, provides in full:\n\n          A sex offender shall register, and keep the\n          registration current, in each jurisdiction\n          where the offender resides, where the offender\n          is an employee, and where the offender is a\n          student.   For initial registration purposes\n          only, a sex offender shall also register in\n          the jurisdiction in which convicted if such\n          jurisdiction    is    different    from    the\n          jurisdiction of residence.\n\nId. § 16913(a).\n\n          The provision, central to achieving SORNA's objectives,\n\nis manifestly remedial in purpose--not punitive. This is borne out\n\nby the evident reason for requiring registration in the first\n\nplace, which is to prevent further crimes, by the statements in\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fCongress   to   the    same     effect,    and     by   the   placement    of    the\n\nregistration provisions in 42 U.S.C. rather than the Criminal Code,\n\n18 U.S.C. There is no presumption against or prohibition on making\n\nremedial measures apply to preexisting circumstances.                 See Smith,\n\n538 U.S. 84.\n\n           SORNA also adopted criminal enforcement provisions, one\n\nof which punishes someone who after SORNA was enacted travels in\n\ninterstate commerce but fails to register in a new state of\n\nresidence within a fixed period.           18 U.S.C. § 2250(a); 42 U.S.C. §\n\n16913; see Carr v. United States, 130 S.Ct. 2229 (2010).                       Here,\n\nDiTomasso--previously         registered      in    Massachusetts     as   a     sex\n\noffender--traveled in interstate commerce after July 27, 2006, and\n\nthen failed to register in Rhode Island even though expressly\n\nadvised of his obligation to register.\n\n           At this point, one might wonder why there is any problem\n\nat all with DiTomasso's conviction.            The problem arises because in\n\nSORNA,   Congress     adopted    not   only      the    blanket   requirement     of\n\nsubsection (a), but also a more detailed provision dealing with\n\ninitial registration (subsection (b)); and a provision titled\n\n\"Initial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with\n\nsubsection (b)\" (subsection (d)). The latter, drafted in language\n\nsomewhat opaque at first, reads:\n\n           (d) Initial registration of sex offenders\n           unable to comply with subsection (b)\n\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\f          The Attorney General shall have the authority\n          to   specify   the    applicability   of   the\n          requirements of this subchapter to sex\n          offenders convicted before July 27, 2006 or\n          its    implementation    in    a    particular\n          jurisdiction, and to prescribe rules for the\n          registration of any such sex offenders and for\n          other categories of sex offenders who are\n          unable to comply with subsection (b).\n\n42 U.S.C. § 16913(d).\n\n          Since both the heading and the main internal cross\n\nreference in the text--\"offenders who are unable to comply with\n\nsubsection   (b)\"--relate   to   subsection   (b),   one   could   read\n\nsubsection (d) as confined to certain problems, mainly dealing with\n\ntiming, that Congress foresaw as to initial registration.9          But\n\nthere is also some evidence that might support subsection (d) as\n\nallowing the Attorney General to qualify the blanket applicability\n\nof subsection (a) itself if special problems arose in applying the\n\nstatute to pre-SORNA convicts.\n\n          Yet if subsection (d) were read to apply to matters other\n\nthan initial registration, it still does not say that SORNA exempts\n\nthose convicted before SORNA unless and until the Attorney General\n\nso determines.   It is perfectly fair to read subsections (a) and\n\n(d) together so that--absent contrary action by the Attorney\n\n\n     9\n      Importantly, state initial registration requirements, varying\nfrom one state to another, could in various circumstances have made\nit infeasible for those convicted prior to SORNA to have registered\nin the manner and within the time limits now prescribed by SORNA's\nsubsection (b) requirements. See Interim Rule on the Applicability\nof SORNA, 72 Fed. Reg. 8894, 8896 (Feb. 28, 2007) (codified at 28\nC.F.R. § 72.3).\n\n                                 -28-\n\fGeneral--SORNA applies to one convicted before SORNA but who\n\n\"travels\" afterwards and refuses to register.    That is the way the\n\nAttorney General himself reads the statute.10   See Applicability of\n\nSORNA, 72 Fed. Reg. 8894 (Feb. 28, 2007) (codified at 28 C.F.R. §\n\n72.3).\n\n            A contrary reading would suppose that Congress left those\n\nwith pre-SORNA convictions free from registration requirements\n\nunless and until the Attorney General got around to regulating; in\n\nprinciple, such a reading would allow him not to regulate them at\n\nall.    This is hardly consistent with Congress' emphatic purpose to\n\nadvance the \"strong public interest in finding\" and imposing\n\nregistration requirements on those already convicted before SORNA\n\nitself.\n\n            Some very capable judges appear initially to have viewed\n\nthe matter differently, but, with respect, there is nothing in text\n\nor history that forbids reading subsection (a) as fully applicable\n\nunless and until the Attorney General limits or qualifies it so far\n\n\n\n       10\n      In certain circumstances, the reading of an official charged\nwith administering an ambiguous statute is entitled to substantial\ndeference so long as it is linguistically permissible, see Chevron\nU.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-45\n(1984); in other circumstances, it has persuasive force, see\nSkidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 US. 134, 140 (1944). In Carr, the\nSupreme Court rejected the Attorney General's reading of a separate\nSORNA provision, but there, the statutory term in issue--\"travels\"-\n-did arguably directly conflict with the Attorney General's\nreading. Here, \"authority to specify\" says nothing express about\nwhether the subsection (a) operates with full force if the Attorney\nGeneral declines to exercise his authority.\n\n                                 -29-\n\fas subsection (d) might permit; and, even if the language could\n\nread either way, this is the reading most consistent with Congress'\n\ncentral purpose.\n\n\n\n\n                               -30-\n\f",

Fitzgerald, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Milind M. Shah, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Peter F. Neronha, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, SELYA and GAJARSA,<sup>[*]</sup> Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), Pub.L. No. 109-248, tit. I, §§ 101-155, 120 Stat. 587, 590-611 (2006), fashioned a national scheme for the registration of sex offenders. This appeal requires us to decide a question about that scheme that has divided the courts of appeals: When did SORNA's registration requirements become operative with respect to a previously convicted sex offender who traveled interstate and failed to register between SORNA's effective date and the promulgation of an interim <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> rule clarifying SORNA's reach? After determining that the registration requirements became generally operative at the time when SORNA was signed into law and rejecting a series of constitutional challenges to the registration scheme, we affirm the defendant's conviction for failure to register.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Because this appeal follows a conviction predicated on a guilty plea, we draw the facts from the change-of-plea colloquy, the uncontested portions of the presentence investigation report, and the sentencing transcript. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Cintrón-Echautegui,</i> 604 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2010); <i>United States v. Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n<p>Defendant-appellant Michael DiTomasso was convicted of sex offenses in Massachusetts in 1995. Upon his release from prison, Massachusetts law required him to register as a sex offender, and he did so. He was on notice that, if he moved out of state, he would have to register as a sex offender in the new venue.</p>\n<p>The defendant kept his Massachusetts registration current through the fall of 2006. In February of 2007, he moved to Woonsocket, Rhode Island,<sup>[1]</sup> and took up residence there. Despite this change of domicile, he did not register as a sex offender in Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>On March 27, 2007, a local police officer informed the defendant that Rhode Island law required him to register. The officer told him that he should report to the police station for that purpose within the week. The defendant did not comply.</p>\n<p>On April 4, 2007, the defendant was arrested for failing to register as a sex offender in Rhode Island. Spurred by this arrest, a federal grand jury handed up an indictment charging the defendant with failing to register under SORNA. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 2250; 42 U.S.C. § 16913. The indictment alleged that the defendant's culpable failure to register began in March 2007 and continued through April 4, 2007 (a period that followed his interstate travel in February of 2007).</p>\n<p>The defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that SORNA did not apply to him and that, in all events, the law's registration requirements were invalid. The government opposed the motion. The district court, in a thoughtful rescript, rejected the defendant's challenge. <i>United States v. DiTomasso,</i> 552 F.Supp.2d 233, 248 (D.R.I.2008). The court ruled that SORNA applied to the defendant from and after its effective date because the law imposed a \"general obligation on sex offenders to register.\" <i>Id.</i> at 241. The court simultaneously rebuffed the defendant's other challenges. <i>Id.</i> at 247-48.</p>\n<p>The defendant elected to enter a conditional guilty plea, Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), preserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss. The district court sentenced him to serve thirty months in prison. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We first consider the defendant's principal argument that SORNA did not apply to him when he committed the alleged offense. We then address his other constitutional claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Applicability of the Registration Requirements.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The defendant pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a). Among other things, this section imposes criminal penalties <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> when a person required to register as a sex offender under SORNA knowingly fails to register after traveling in interstate commerce. For SORNA purposes, a \"sex offender\" is \"an individual who was convicted of a sex offense.\" 42 U.S.C. § 16911(1). The defendant concedes that he falls within this taxonomy. To understand his argument that SORNA's registration requirements, 42 U.S.C. § 16913(a), (c), nonetheless do not apply to him, we must understand the architecture of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p>The registration requirements are laid out in section 16913, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender is a student. For initial registration purposes only, a sex offender shall also register in the jurisdiction in which convicted if such jurisdiction is different from the jurisdiction of residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) Initial registration</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The sex offender shall initially register </blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) not later than 3 business days after being sentenced for that offense, if the sex offender is not sentenced to a term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(c) Keeping the registration current</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A sex offender shall, not later than 3 business days after each change of name, residence, employment, or student status, appear in person in at least 1 jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a) and inform that jurisdiction of all changes in the information required for that offender in the sex offender registry. That jurisdiction shall immediately provide that information to all other jurisdictions in which the offender is required to register.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(d) Initial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b) The Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter or its implementation in a particular jurisdiction, and to prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offenders and for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with subsection (b).</blockquote>\n<p>42 U.S.C. § 16913.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>SORNA became law on July 27, 2006. On February 28, 2007, the Attorney General, acting pursuant to the authority explicitly granted to him in section 16913(d), promulgated an interim rule \"to eliminate any possible uncertainty about the applicability of [SORNA's] requirements . . . to sex offenders whose predicate convictions predate the enactment of SORNA.\" Applicability of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, 72 Fed.Reg. 8894, 8896 (Feb. 28, 2007). This rule declares that SORNA's requirements \"apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> is required prior to the enactment of [SORNA].\" 28 C.F.R. § 72.3.</p>\n<p>The courts of appeals have disagreed about the meaning and effect of this statutory/regulatory mosaic. <i>See </i><i>Carr v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2229, 2234 n. 2, 176 L.Ed.2d 1152 (2010) (noting circuit split). The disagreement centers on subsection (d), which contains two pertinent clauses. The question boils down to whether the first clause, stating that \"[t]he Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter or its implementation in a particular jurisdiction,\" gave the Attorney General authority to determine the applicability of SORNA to all persons who stood convicted of sex offenses on SORNA's effective date or, alternatively, as indicated in the following clause of subsection (d) (\"to prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offenders and for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with subsection (b)\"), to determine its applicability only as to specific subsets of those offenders.</p>\n<p>Some courts have determined, often over emphatic dissents, that the statute unambiguously gave the Attorney General the authority to determine SORNA's applicability to all persons previously convicted of sex offenses. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Cain,</i> 583 F.3d 408, 414-15 (6th Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Hatcher,</i> 560 F.3d 222, 228 (4th Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Madera,</i> 528 F.3d 852, 858 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). If this view is correct, SORNA did not apply to previously convicted sex offenders until the Attorney General promulgated the interim rule. <i>See </i><i>Hatcher,</i> 560 F.3d at 229.</p>\n<p>Other courts, deeming the statute ambiguous, have construed it to signify that the Attorney General only had authority to determine SORNA's applicability to previously convicted sex offenders who were unable initially to register under SORNA.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Hinckley,</i> 550 F.3d 926, 930, 932-33, 935 (10th Cir.2008), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2383, 173 L.Ed.2d 1301 (2009); <i>United States v. May,</i> 535 F.3d 912, 918-19 (8th Cir.2008), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2431, 174 L.Ed.2d 229 (2009); <i>see also </i><i>Cain,</i> 583 F.3d at 424 (Griffin, J., dissenting); <i>Hatcher,</i> 560 F.3d at 229 (Shedd, J., dissenting). Under this view, registered sex offenders who had a state-law duty to keep their registrations current on SORNA's effective date became subject to a new obligation to register for federal purposes when, thereafter, they moved to a different state. <i>See </i><i>May,</i> 535 F.3d at 919. If this view is correct, SORNA applied to previously convicted sex offenders as of the date of its enactment.</p>\n<p>The defendant urges us to follow the Fourth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits and hold that SORNA's registration requirements did not apply to him when he traveled interstate. In his view, the plain language of subsection (d) delegates to the Attorney General sole authority to determine whether SORNA applies to any or all sex offenders with preexisting convictions and, inasmuch as the Attorney General did not exercise this authority until February 28, 2007 (when he promulgated the interim rule), convicted sex offenders who traveled before that date and failed to register did not violate SORNA's registration requirements. Any other reading of the statute, he contends, would transgress the Ex Post <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 3, which prohibits \"punishment for an act which was not punishable at the time it was committed.\" <i>Weaver v. Graham,</i> 450 U.S. 24, 28, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981) (quoting <i>Cummings v. Missouri,</i> 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277, 325-26, 18 L.Ed. 356 (1867)). Because this claim presents a question of statutory construction, we afford de novo review. <i>United States v. Leahy,</i> 473 F.3d 401, 405 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>\"Statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute.\" <i>Ruiz v. Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp.,</i> 496 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2007). Absent some indication that the words of a statute have an \"exotic meaning,\" we normally assume that the language employed carries its usual and ordinary meaning. <i>SEC v. Tambone,</i> 597 F.3d 436, 442 (1st Cir.2010) (en banc). If the meaning of the text is plain, we generally need go no further. <i>In re Hill,</i> 562 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>This general rule, like virtually every general rule, admits of exceptions. One such exception is pertinent here. No less an authority than the Supreme Court has warned that \"the meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context.\" <i>Holloway v. United States,</i> 526 U.S. 1, 7, 119 S.Ct. 966, 143 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999) (quoting <i>Brown v. Gardner,</i> 513 U.S. 115, 118, 115 S.Ct. 552, 130 L.Ed.2d 462 (1994)); <i>see also </i><i>Davis v. Mich. Dep't of Treas.,</i> 489 U.S. 803, 809, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989) (\"[W]ords of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\").</p>\n<p>The language at issue here  the first clause of subsection (d)  states that \"[t]he Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter. . . .\" 42 U.S.C. § 16913(d). Although this language might appear straightforward if read in a vacuum, a mechanical reading of it as applying to all previously convicted sex offenders would wrest it from its contextual moorings. Taking into account the context in which this provision operates, we do not believe that such a mechanical construction is what Congress intended.</p>\n<p>In our judgment, a different canon of construction dominates the interpretive landscape in this instance. When congressional intent is clear and a statute plausibly can be read to effectuate that intent, that reading must prevail over a more semantically correct reading of the statutory language. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Hill,</i> 562 F.3d at 32 (\"[P]lain meaning sometimes must yield if its application would bring about results that are either absurd or antithetical to Congress's discernible intent.\"). We explain below why we think that this is such a case.</p>\n<p>In the absence of a clear congressional direction to the contrary  and there is none here  \"a law takes effect on the date of its enactment.\" <i>Gozlon-Peretz v. United States,</i> 498 U.S. 395, 404, 111 S.Ct. 840, 112 L.Ed.2d 919 (1991). SORNA was signed into law on July 27, 2006. Subsection (a), which requires that sex offenders \"register, and keep the registration current,\" 42 U.S.C. § 16913(a), unarguably became law at that time. The same is true of subsection (b), which describes SORNA's initial registration requirements, <i>id.</i> § 16913(b), and of subsection (c), which demands the updating of registration information within three business days of a change of name, residence, employment, or student status, <i>id.</i> § 16913(c). Thus, but for subsection (d), any argument that the section cannot operate in advance of action by the Attorney General would be absurd.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> Based on this analysis, we disagree with the Sixth Circuit's reading of subsections (a)-(c). <i>See </i><i>Cain,</i> 583 F.3d at 414-15 (\"Congress did not enact language providing a default position . . . the statute does not read `the Attorney General shall have the authority to waive the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter.'\"). Subsections (a), (b), and (c) contain clear and directory language, and when statutory language is written as a clear directive, the rule is that, in the absence of limiting language, the statute is effective as of the date of its enactment. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Shenandoah,</i> 595 F.3d 151, 157-58 (3d Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 3433, 177 L.Ed.2d 341 (2010). There is no limiting language here.</p>\n<p>Subsection (d) is anything but a clear direction to the contrary. Courts holding otherwise have read the language of this subsection as giving the Attorney General the exclusive authority to apply the registration requirements to any and <i>all</i> previously convicted sex offenders. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Hatcher,</i> 560 F.3d at 227. To arrive at this interpretation, those courts have surgically removed subsection (d) from the rest of the section and have read its text in a vacuum. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cain,</i> 583 F.3d at 414. We are unwilling to take so struthious an approach. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Heirs of Boisdore,</i> 49 U.S. (8 How.) 113, 122, 12 L.Ed. 1009 (1849) (explaining that \"[i]n expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy\"). Context must be considered  and contextual awareness is especially important when interpreting the provisions of a comprehensive regulatory scheme. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> 529 U.S. 120, 133, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000) (directing courts to interpret such a statute \"as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme\" (quoting <i>Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,</i> 513 U.S. 561, 569, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1 (1995))). Congress intended SORNA to function as such a scheme. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 16901 (stating that Congress sought to \"establish[] a comprehensive national system for the registration of [sex] offenders\"); <i>see also </i><i>May,</i> 535 F.3d at 919-20 (discussing Congressional intent to create regulatory scheme when enacting SORNA).</p>\n<p>When viewed as a part of a seamless regulatory scheme, subsection (d) has a distinct office: it appears to reflect Congress's recognition that specific applications of the registration requirements to previously convicted sex offenders may have unintended consequences. Thus, subsection (d) allows  but does not compel  the Attorney General to narrow SORNA's sweep if and to the extent that he concludes that specific situations invite such narrowing. Several contextual considerations support this view.</p>\n<p>First, it cannot be gainsaid that Congress enacted SORNA to \"establish[] a comprehensive national system for the registration of [sex] offenders.\" 42 U.S.C. § 16901. The Act defines a \"sex offender\" as \"an individual who <i>was</i> convicted of a sex offense.\" <i>Id.</i> § 16911(1) (emphasis supplied). It is significant that this past-tense definition makes no exceptions. <i>See </i><i>Hatcher,</i> 560 F.3d at 232 (Shedd, J., dissenting) (concluding that this past-tense usage \"expressly sweeps persons . . . convicted of sex offenses prior to SORNA's enactment within the statute's scope\"); <i>see also </i><i>Carr,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2236 (noting importance of Congress's choice of verb tense in interpreting statute's temporal reach).</p>\n<p>Second, the structure of section 16913 strongly suggests that this past-tense usage is not a scrivener's error. The office of subsection (a) is to ensure the registration of <i>all</i> sex offenders. Congress spoke <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> with conspicuous clarity in making subsection (a) all-encompassing: \"A sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides. . . .\" 42 U.S.C. § 16913(a). By the same token, neither subsection (b), which elaborates on initial registration requirements, nor subsection (c), which delineates continuing registration requirements, distinguishes between pre-SORNA and post-SORNA sex offense convictions. <i>See id.</i> § 16913(b)-(c); <i>see also </i><i>Hinckley,</i> 550 F.3d at 944 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Third, SORNA was tailored to fashion a comprehensive regulatory scheme. 42 U.S.C. § 16901. Construing subsection (d) to exempt a broad swath of the convicted sex offender population  indeed, the entirety of it, until the Attorney General acts  would fit uncomfortably with the remainder of the Act.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the title of subsection (d) specifies that the authority it describes relates to the \"[i]nitial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b).\" This language clearly indicates that the scope of the authority conferred upon the Attorney General by subsection (d) is limited to prescribing rules governing those offenders unable to comply with SORNA's initial registration requirements under subsection (b) and not pre-SORNA sex offenders more generally. <i>See </i><i>Hinckley,</i> 550 F.3d at 933.</p>\n<p>Some of the courts that have endorsed a contrary construction of subsection (d) have disregarded the title of the subsection based on the principle that courts only look to the title of a law in the event of ambiguity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cain,</i> 583 F.3d at 416; <i>Hatcher,</i> 560 F.3d at 226. But that principle does not pertain where, as here, an inquiring court's primary task is to place a statute in context before attempting to construe it. Thus, we do not use the title to \"undo or limit what the text makes plain.\" <i>Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v. Balt. &amp; Ohio R.R. Co.,</i> 331 U.S. 519, 529, 67 S.Ct. 1387, 91 L.Ed. 1646 (1947).</p>\n<p>Fifth, the language of the second clause of subsection (d), which states that the Attorney General shall have the authority \"to prescribe rules . . . for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with subsection (b),\" informs our understanding of the first clause of subsection (d). The second clause suggests that the authority conferred by the first clause of subsection (d) was intended to extend only to those previously convicted offenders who were unable to comply with subsection (b), and not to previously convicted offenders more generally. The use of the word \"other\" in the second clause is most naturally read to indicate Congress's contemplation that the \"sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter\" referenced in the first clause will form one subset of \"offenders unable to comply with subsection (b).\" <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc.,</i> 758 F.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"All words and provisions of statutes are intended to have meaning and are to be given effect, and no construction should be adopted which would render statutory words or phrases meaningless, redundant or superfluous.\"). This interpretation of the interaction between the two clauses of subsection (d) leaves intact the registration requirements articulated in subsection (a) and limits the applicability of subsection (d) to those offenders unable to comply with the requirements of subsection (b). <i>See </i><i>Hinckley,</i> 550 F.3d at 932.</p>\n<p>Sixth, and finally, our view of the scope of subsection (d) is informed by the way in which Congress chose to delegate authority to the Attorney General. The subsection provides that the Attorney General \"shall have the authority\" to determine the applicability of the requirements imposed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> by SORNA. 42 U.S.C. § 16913(d). It is thus apparent that the drafters eschewed the use of mandatory language (e.g., \"shall determine\") that would have compelled the Attorney General to make an affirmative determination before the statute could be applied to any previously convicted sex offender. In its use of permissive language, subsection (d) differs from other SORNA provisions in which Congress mandated action by the Attorney General. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> § 16917(b) (directing that \"the Attorney General <i>shall</i> prescribe rules for the notification of sex offenders\"). Congress's decision to couch some provisions of the statute in mandatory language but to couch subsection (d) in discretionary language is a telltale sign.<sup>[4]</sup><i>See </i><i>Duncan v. Walker,</i> 533 U.S. 167, 172-74, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001). We think that this language says what it means and means what is says: that the Attorney General does not have to act before SORNA's registration requirements become effective as to previously convicted sex offenders. <i>See </i><i>Shenandoah,</i> 595 F.3d at 157-58.</p>\n<p>Congress obviously knew how to direct action by the Attorney General and how to give discretionary authority to him. In drafting subsection (d), Congress chose the latter course. We regard this choice as deliberate and, thus, as favoring a reading of subsection (d) as a grant to the Attorney General of discretion to provide limited relief from the broad requirements imposed by SORNA in order to account for problematic permutations that might arise with respect to some previously convicted sex offenders.</p>\n<p>These lampposts light the path that we must follow. The language, structure, and purpose of subsection (d) and the context in which it operates combine to show its unambiguous meaning. We hold that, in framing subsection (d), Congress did not contemplate a statutory scheme in which the application of the general rules limned in subsections (a), (b), and (c) to previously convicted sex offenders would hinge on action by the Attorney General.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>For purposes of the case at hand, this holding gets the grease from the goose. It teaches that the general rules requiring updates to sex offender registration took effect when SORNA was signed into law. Those requirements were thus in full force when, in February of 2007, the defendant traveled to a new state. When he failed to register there, he violated federal law. His prosecution for that offense poses no Ex Post Facto concerns.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> B. <i>Other Claims.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The defendant advances two other arguments. First, he maintains that Congress lacked power under the Commerce Clause to enact sex offender registration requirements. Second, he asseverates that his conviction infringes his rights under the Due Process Clause because it was impossible for him to comply with SORNA at the time of his interstate travel.<sup>[7]</sup> We address these arguments separately, mindful of our obligation to review constitutional challenges de novo. <i>United States v. Volungus,</i> 595 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>1. <i>Commerce Clause.</i> The Commerce Clause provides in pertinent part that \"[t]he Congress shall have Power To . . . regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8. The Supreme Court has described the extent of Congress's power to legislate under the Commerce Clause as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[W]e have identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power. First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 558-59, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Keying to this test, the defendant launches an as-applied challenge. He argues that SORNA does not regulate the channels or instrumentalities of, persons in, or activities having a substantial effect on, interstate commerce. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 608-09, 613, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000); <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 558-59, 115 S.Ct. 1624. This argument fails because SORNA, as applied here, explicitly regulates the use of the channels of, and persons in, interstate commerce. Interstate travel is, after all, an express element of the SORNA violation with which the defendant was charged and of which he stands convicted. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a)(2)(B). That is all that is needed to satisfy the <i>Lopez</i> standard. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Guzman,</i> 591 F.3d 83, 89-91 (2d Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 3487, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010); <i>Shenandoah,</i> 595 F.3d at 160-61; <i>United States v. Zuniga,</i> 579 F.3d 845, 850 (8th Cir.2009) (per curiam), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 3384, 177 L.Ed.2d 305 (2010). Given the presence of this element, the statute has a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce to survive the defendant's Commerce Clause challenge.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> 2. <i>Due Process.</i> The defendant's final argument is state-specific. He contends that because Rhode Island had not \"implemented\" SORNA at the time that he traveled interstate, he could not have complied with the law's registration requirements. Therefore, his conviction trespasses upon his right to due process.</p>\n<p>We need not tarry. Although this \"impossibility\" argument is new to us in this context, it has been uniformly rejected elsewhere. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Hester,</i> 589 F.3d 86, 92 (2d Cir.2009) (per curiam), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2137, 176 L.Ed.2d 757 (2010); <i>United States v. Griffey,</i> 589 F.3d 1363, 1366 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam), <i>cert. denied.</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 3290, 176 L.Ed.2d 1196 (2010); <i>United States v. Gould,</i> 568 F.3d 459, 463-65 (4th Cir.2009), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1686, 176 L.Ed.2d 186 (2010). We join that queue, pausing only to offer a decurtate statement of our reasoning.</p>\n<p>SORNA contains commands aimed at two different audiences: convicted sex offenders and states. Convicted sex offenders must register. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 16913. States must take various steps, such as maintaining a jurisdiction-wide sex offender registry, enacting criminal penalties for failures to register, and sharing information with other registries. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> §§ 16912(a), 16913(e), 16921(b). A state's failure to take these steps may lead to a loss of federal funds. <i>See id.</i> § 16925(a); <i>Gould,</i> 568 F.3d at 463 n. 1. Of critical importance, however, the registration requirements for sex offenders are neither conditioned on nor harnessed to state implementation of SORNA's state-directed mandates.</p>\n<p>In any event, by the time that Congress enacted SORNA, every state had a sex offender registration law in place. <i>See </i><i>Smith v. Doe,</i> 538 U.S. 84, 90, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003). SORNA's registration requirements do not contemplate a specific type of registration; they merely require a sex offender to \"register. . . in each jurisdiction where the offender resides.\" 42 U.S.C. § 16913(a). Registration in accordance with a preexisting state sex offender registration law satisfies SORNA. <i>See </i><i>Griffey,</i> 589 F.3d at 1366 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p>This construct makes good sense given SORNA's office as a mechanism for identifying sex offenders who otherwise might slip through the cracks and elude state-by-state registration requirements by moving across state lines. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 16901; <i>see also</i> National Guidelines for Sex Offender Registration and Notification, 73 Fed.Reg. 38,030, 38,030 (July 2, 2008) (explaining that SORNA was enacted to \"eliminate potential gaps and loopholes under the pre-existing standards by means of which sex offenders could attempt to evade registration requirements\"). The result is that, as long as a state maintains a registration mechanism for sex offenders, what the state does or does not do with respect to implementing its state-specific obligations under SORNA is not relevant to a sex offender's obligation to register. <i>See </i><i>Gould,</i> 568 F.3d at 465.</p>\n<p>This dichotomy creates no unfairness here. Although Rhode Island may not have fully complied with its responsibilities under SORNA at the time of the defendant's federal crime, it did maintain a sex offender registry. The defendant could  and should  have registered there, as local <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> police directed him to do. It follows that there was no due process violation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we uphold the district court's well-reasoned refusal to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>Judge Selya's decision for the panel lays out lucidly the reasons why the statutory language and canons of constructionalways the first resort in interpretation support applying the statute to the defendant. It may be useful to underscore two further points: that the statute's design leans against the narrow reading adopted by several other circuits and that Congress' purpose supports the broader one that we adopt today.</p>\n<p>National standards for sex offender registration have existed since 1994, when the Congress provided federal funding to states that enacted sex offender registration laws. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 14071. By the time that the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), Pub.L. No. 109-248, tit. I, 120 Stat. 590 (42 U.S.C. § 16901 <i>et seq.</i>), was signed into law on July 27, 2006, every stateincluding Massachusetts and Rhode Islandhad enacted a sex offender registration law. <i>See</i> National Guidelines for Sex Offender Registration and Notification, 73 Fed.Reg. 38,030, 38,030 (July 2, 2008); <i>see also </i><i>Smith v. Doe,</i> 538 U.S. 84, 90, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003).</p>\n<p>But the pre-SORNA state-by-state schemes contained potential gaps and loopholes through which sex offenders could attempt to evade registration requirements or the consequences of registration violations. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, at 23. Senator Cantwell explained: \"Child sex offenders have exploited this stunning lack of uniformity, and the consequences have been tragic. Twenty percent of the Nation's 560,000 sex offenders are `lost' because State offender registry programs are not coordinated well enough.\" 152 Cong. Rec. S8020 (daily ed. July 20, 2006). SORNA's aim, repeated throughout the debate in Congress, was to impose on this patchwork a uniform, \"comprehensive\" federal registration statute. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 16901; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Hinckley,</i> 550 F.3d 926, 947 (10th Cir.2008) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>SORNA pressed stateson pain of losing federal fundingto adopt new federal standards in their own sex offender registration programs. 42 U.S.C. § 16925. In addition, it directly imposed new federal registration obligations on sex offenders and provided for federal enforcement of those obligations. 42 U.S.C. §§ 16913-16917. What is important to the case before us is that Congress intended the enforcement provisions to apply of their own force to those who had previously been convicted and not just to newly convicted offenders.</p>\n<p>The House Judiciary Committee report on an earlier version of SORNA explained that SORNA would address the \"strong public interest in finding\" previously convicted offenders who were not currently registered \"and having them register with current information to mitigate the risks of additional crimes against children.\" H.R.Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, at 24. Similarly, Senator Kyl explained: \"There currently are over 100,000 sex offenders in this country who are required to register but are `off the system.' They are not registered. The penalties in this bill should be adequate to ensure that <i>these individuals</i> register.\" 152 Cong. Rec. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> S8025 (daily ed. July 20, 2006) (emphasis added); <i>accord id.</i> at S8013 (Sen. Hatch).</p>\n<p>Consonantly, the SORNA provision on registry requirements for sex offenders has a single opening paragraph, titled \"In general,\" that directs all \"sex offender[s]\" to register and to keep their registration current, 42 U.S.C. § 16913(a), and SORNA defines the term sex offender as \"an individual who <i>was</i> convicted of a sex offense,\" <i>id.</i> § 16911(1) (emphasis added). Subsection (a), without exempting offenders with convictions before SORNA came into force, provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote>A sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender is a student. For initial registration purposes only, a sex offender shall also register in the jurisdiction in which convicted if such jurisdiction is different from the jurisdiction of residence.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 16913(a).</p>\n<p>The provision, central to achieving SORNA's objectives, is manifestly remedial in purposenot punitive. This is borne out by the evident reason for requiring registration in the first place, which is to prevent further crimes, by the statements in Congress to the same effect, and by the placement of the registration provisions in 42 U.S.C. rather than the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. There is no presumption against or prohibition on making remedial measures apply to preexisting circumstances. <i>See </i><i>Smith,</i> 538 U.S. 84, 123 S.Ct. 1140.</p>\n<p>SORNA also adopted criminal enforcement provisions, one of which punishes someone who after SORNA was enacted travels in interstate commerce but fails to register in a new state of residence within a fixed period. 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a); 42 U.S.C. § 16913; <i>see </i><i>Carr v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2229, 176 L.Ed.2d 1152 (2010). Here, DiTomassopreviously registered in Massachusetts as a sex offendertraveled in interstate commerce after July 27, 2006, and then failed to register in Rhode Island even though expressly advised of his obligation to register.</p>\n<p>At this point, one might wonder why there is any problem at all with DiTomasso's conviction. The problem arises because in SORNA, Congress adopted not only the blanket requirement of subsection (a), but also a more detailed provision dealing with initial registration (subsection (b)); and a provision titled \"Initial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b)\" (subsection (d)). The latter, drafted in language somewhat opaque at first, reads:</p>\n<blockquote>(d) Initial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b) The Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before July 27, 2006 or its implementation in a particular jurisdiction, and to prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offenders and for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with subsection (b).</blockquote>\n<p>42 U.S.C. § 16913(d).</p>\n<p>Since both the heading and the main internal cross reference in the text\"offenders who are unable to comply with subsection (b)\"relate to subsection (b), one could read subsection (d) as confined to certain problems, mainly dealing with timing, that Congress foresaw as to initial registration.<sup>[9]</sup> But there is also some evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> that might support subsection (d) as allowing the Attorney General to qualify the blanket applicability of subsection (a) itself if special problems arose in applying the statute to pre-SORNA convicts.</p>\n<p>Yet if subsection (d) were read to apply to matters other than initial registration, it still does <i>not</i> say that SORNA exempts those convicted before SORNA unless and until the Attorney General so determines. It is perfectly fair to read subsections (a) and (d) together so thatabsent contrary action by the Attorney GeneralSORNA applies to one convicted before SORNA but who \"travels\" afterwards and refuses to register. That is the way the Attorney General himself reads the statute.<sup>[10]</sup><i>See</i> Applicability of SORNA, 72 Fed.Reg. 8894 (Feb. 28, 2007) (codified at 28 C.F.R. § 72.3).</p>\n<p>A contrary reading would suppose that Congress left those with pre-SORNA convictions free from registration requirements unless and until the Attorney General got around to regulating; in principle, such a reading would allow him not to regulate them at all. This is hardly consistent with Congress' emphatic purpose to advance the \"strong public interest in finding\" and imposing registration requirements on those already convicted before SORNA itself.</p>\n<p>Some very capable judges appear initially to have viewed the matter differently, but, with respect, there is nothing in text or history that forbids reading subsection (a) as fully applicable unless and until the Attorney General limits or qualifies it so far as subsection (d) might permit; and, even if the language could read either way, this is the reading most consistent with Congress' central purpose.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The record does not indicate an exact date, but the government, at least provisionally, acknowledges that the defendant's interstate travel occurred before February 27, 2007.</p>\n<p>[2]  There is a discrepancy between the United States Code and the United States Code Annotated with respect to the language of 42 U.S.C. § 16913. The version printed in the United States Code Annotated contains the words \"of this section\" in subsections (c) and (d) when cross-referencing other subsections of the provision, but the version printed in the United States Code does not. We quote here the version in the United States Code, as it is the official version of the statute. This difference, however, has absolutely no bearing on the substance of our discussion.</p>\n<p>[3]  An example would be an offender who had been convicted of a sex offense but was not required to register (or could not register) under any state law prior to SORNA's enactment. <i>See</i> 72 Fed.Reg. at 8896.</p>\n<p>[4]  We note that the phrase \"shall have the authority\" is typically used, elsewhere in the United States Code, to denote a grant of authority to perform a discretionary act. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 6 U.S.C. § 112(b)(2) (stating that Secretary of Homeland Security \"shall have the authority to make contracts\"); 12 U.S.C. § 3907(a)(2) (stating that federal banking regulators \"shall have the authority\" to set minimum capital requirements); 16 U.S.C. § 459j-2(d) (stating that Secretary of the Interior \"shall have the authority\" to condemn property); <i>see also </i><i>Cain,</i> 583 F.3d at 427-30 (Griffin, J., dissenting) (cataloguing judicial interpretations of similar discretionary provisions).</p>\n<p>[5]  The interim rule promulgated by the Attorney General indicates that this interpretation is correct. It states that \"[t]his rule <i>forecloses</i>\" claims that the Attorney General must first act before SORNA applies. 72 Fed.Reg. at 8896 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>[6]  The defendant argues only that his prosecution under SORNA violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because it penalized him for conduct (interstate travel) that occurred prior to the date that SORNA applied to him. He does not raise the related, but distinct, claim that the overall applicability of SORNA presents an Ex Post Facto Clause problem because SORNA imposes punishment for a preexisting crime. We therefore do not address this second issue here.</p>\n<p>[7]  In supplemental briefing, the defendant tried to raise a further argument: that the Attorney General's promulgation of the interim rule violated the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553. This argument was available to the defendant when he filed his opening brief (indeed, he made it below), so it falls within the familiar rule that issues not advanced in an appellant's opening brief are deemed waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vázquez-Rivera,</i> 407 F.3d 476, 487-88 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,</i> 904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>[8]  The defendant suggests that the registration requirement contained in 42 U.S.C. § 16913 itself exceeds Congress's power under the Commerce Clause. This suggestion is incorrect. The Necessary and Proper Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 18, provides Congress with ample authority to regulate local activity as part of a general scheme regulating interstate commerce. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Guzman,</i> 591 F.3d at 91; <i>United States v. Whaley,</i> 577 F.3d 254, 260-61 (5th Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Ambert,</i> 561 F.3d 1202, 1211-12 (11th Cir.2009); <i>see also </i><i>Volungus,</i> 595 F.3d at 5-6.</p>\n<p>[9]  Importantly, state initial registration requirements, varying from one state to another, could in various circumstances have made it infeasible for those convicted prior to SORNA to have registered in the manner and within the time limits now prescribed by SORNA's subsection (b) requirements. <i>See</i> Interim Rule on the Applicability of SORNA, 72 Fed.Reg. 8894, 8896 (Feb. 28, 2007) (codified at 28 C.F.R. § 72.3).</p>\n<p>[10]  In certain circumstances, the reading of an official charged with administering an ambiguous statute is entitled to substantial deference so long as it is linguistically permissible, <i>see </i><i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 842-45, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); in other circumstances, it has persuasive force, <i>see </i><i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). In <i>Carr,</i> the Supreme Court rejected the Attorney General's reading of a separate SORNA provision, but there, the statutory term in issue\"travels\"did arguably directly conflict with the Attorney General's reading. Here, \"authority to specify\" says nothing express about whether the subsection (a) operates with full force if the Attorney General declines to exercise his authority.</p>\n\n</div>",

No. 109-248, tit. I, §§ 101-155, 120 Stat. 587, 590-611 (2006), fashioned a national scheme for the registration of sex offenders. This appeal requires us to decide a question about that scheme that has divided the courts of appeals: When did SORNA's registration requirements become operative with respect to a previously convicted sex offender who traveled interstate and failed to register between SORNA's effective date and the promulgation of an interim <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> rule clarifying SORNA's reach? After determining that the registration requirements became generally operative at the time when SORNA was signed into law and rejecting a series of constitutional challenges to the registration scheme, we affirm the defendant's conviction for failure to register.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Because this appeal follows a conviction predicated on a guilty plea, we draw the facts from the change-of-plea colloquy, the uncontested portions of the presentence investigation report, and the sentencing transcript. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Cintrón-Echautegui,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1675\"><a href=\"/opinion/1675/united-states-v-cintron-echautegui/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir. 2010); <i>United States v. Dietz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n<p>Defendant-appellant Michael DiTomasso was convicted of sex offenses in Massachusetts in 1995. Upon his release from prison, Massachusetts law required him to register as a sex offender, and he did so. He was on notice that, if he moved out of state, he would have to register as a sex offender in the new venue.</p>\n<p>The defendant kept his Massachusetts registration current through the fall of 2006. In February of 2007, he moved to Woonsocket, Rhode Island,<sup>[1]</sup> and took up residence there. Despite this change of domicile, he did not register as a sex offender in Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>On March 27, 2007, a local police officer informed the defendant that Rhode Island law required him to register. The officer told him that he should report to the police station for that purpose within the week. The defendant did not comply.</p>\n<p>On April 4, 2007, the defendant was arrested for failing to register as a sex offender in Rhode Island. Spurred by this arrest, a federal grand jury handed up an indictment charging the defendant with failing to register under SORNA. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 2250; 42 U.S.C. § 16913. The indictment alleged that the defendant's culpable failure to register began in March 2007 and continued through April 4, 2007 (a period that followed his interstate travel in February of 2007).</p>\n<p>The defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that SORNA did not apply to him and that, in all events, the law's registration requirements were invalid. The government opposed the motion. The district court, in a thoughtful rescript, rejected the defendant's challenge. <i>United States v. DiTomasso,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525934\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525934/united-states-v-ditomasso/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span>, 248 (D.R.I.2008). The court ruled that SORNA applied to the defendant from and after its effective date because the law imposed a \"general obligation on sex offenders to register.\" <i>Id.</i> at 241. The court simultaneously rebuffed the defendant's other challenges. <i>Id.</i> at 247-48.</p>\n<p>The defendant elected to enter a conditional guilty plea, Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), preserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss. The district court sentenced him to serve thirty months in prison. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We first consider the defendant's principal argument that SORNA did not apply to him when he committed the alleged offense. We then address his other constitutional claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Applicability of the Registration Requirements.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The defendant pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a). Among other things, this section imposes criminal penalties <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> when a person required to register as a sex offender under SORNA knowingly fails to register after traveling in interstate commerce. For SORNA purposes, a \"sex offender\" is \"an individual who was convicted of a sex offense.\" 42 U.S.C. § 16911(1). The defendant concedes that he falls within this taxonomy. To understand his argument that SORNA's registration requirements, 42 U.S.C. § 16913(a), (c), nonetheless do not apply to him, we must understand the architecture of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p>The registration requirements are laid out in section 16913, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender is a student. For initial registration purposes only, a sex offender shall also register in the jurisdiction in which convicted if such jurisdiction is different from the jurisdiction of residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) Initial registration</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The sex offender shall initially register </blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) not later than 3 business days after being sentenced for that offense, if the sex offender is not sentenced to a term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(c) Keeping the registration current</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A sex offender shall, not later than 3 business days after each change of name, residence, employment, or student status, appear in person in at least 1 jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a) and inform that jurisdiction of all changes in the information required for that offender in the sex offender registry. That jurisdiction shall immediately provide that information to all other jurisdictions in which the offender is required to register.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(d) Initial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b) The Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter or its implementation in a particular jurisdiction, and to prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offenders and for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with subsection (b).</blockquote>\n<p>42 U.S.C. § 16913.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>SORNA became law on July 27, 2006. On February 28, 2007, the Attorney General, acting pursuant to the authority explicitly granted to him in section 16913(d), promulgated an interim rule \"to eliminate any possible uncertainty about the applicability of [SORNA's] requirements . . . to sex offenders whose predicate convictions predate the enactment of SORNA.\" Applicability of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, 72 Fed.Reg. 8894, 8896 (Feb. 28, 2007). This rule declares that SORNA's requirements \"apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> is required prior to the enactment of [SORNA].\" 28 C.F.R. § 72.3.</p>\n<p>The courts of appeals have disagreed about the meaning and effect of this statutory/regulatory mosaic. <i>See </i><i>Carr v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"147527\"><a href=\"/opinion/147527/carr-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1152</span></a></span> (2010) (noting circuit split). The disagreement centers on subsection (d), which contains two pertinent clauses. The question boils down to whether the first clause, stating that \"[t]he Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter or its implementation in a particular jurisdiction,\" gave the Attorney General authority to determine the applicability of SORNA to all persons who stood convicted of sex offenses on SORNA's effective date or, alternatively, as indicated in the following clause of subsection (d) (\"to prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offenders and for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with subsection (b)\"), to determine its applicability only as to specific subsets of those offenders.</p>\n<p>Some courts have determined, often over emphatic dissents, that the statute unambiguously gave the Attorney General the authority to determine SORNA's applicability to all persons previously convicted of sex offenses. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Cain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1267312\"><a href=\"/opinion/1267312/united-states-v-cain/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span>, 414-15 (6th Cir.2009); <i>United States v.

If this view is correct, SORNA did not apply to previously convicted sex offenders until the Attorney General promulgated the interim rule. <i>See </i><i>Hatcher,</i> 560 F.3d at 229.</p>\n<p>Other courts, deeming the statute ambiguous, have construed it to signify that the Attorney General only had authority to determine SORNA's applicability to previously convicted sex offenders who were unable initially to register under SORNA.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v.

Under this view, registered sex offenders who had a state-law duty to keep their registrations current on SORNA's effective date became subject to a new obligation to register for federal purposes when, thereafter, they moved to a different state. <i>See </i><i>May,</i> 535 F.3d at 919. If this view is correct, SORNA applied to previously convicted sex offenders as of the date of its enactment.</p>\n<p>The defendant urges us to follow the Fourth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits and hold that SORNA's registration requirements did not apply to him when he traveled interstate. In his view, the plain language of subsection (d) delegates to the Attorney General sole authority to determine whether SORNA applies to any or all sex offenders with preexisting convictions and, inasmuch as the Attorney General did not exercise this authority until February 28, 2007 (when he promulgated the interim rule), convicted sex offenders who traveled before that date and failed to register did not violate SORNA's registration requirements. Any other reading of the statute, he contends, would transgress the Ex Post <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art.

Although this language might appear straightforward if read in a vacuum, a mechanical reading of it as applying to all previously convicted sex offenders would wrest it from its contextual moorings. Taking into account the context in which this provision operates, we do not believe that such a mechanical construction is what Congress intended.</p>\n<p>In our judgment, a different canon of construction dominates the interpretive landscape in this instance. When congressional intent is clear and a statute plausibly can be read to effectuate that intent, that reading must prevail over a more semantically correct reading of the statutory language. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Hill,</i> 562 F.3d at 32 (\"[P]lain meaning sometimes must yield if its application would bring about results that are either absurd or antithetical to Congress's discernible intent.\").

Subsection (a), which requires that sex offenders \"register, and keep the registration current,\" 42 U.S.C. § 16913(a), unarguably became law at that time. The same is true of subsection (b), which describes SORNA's initial registration requirements, <i>id.</i> § 16913(b), and of subsection (c), which demands the updating of registration information within three business days of a change of name, residence, employment, or student status, <i>id.</i> § 16913(c). Thus, but for subsection (d), any argument that the section cannot operate in advance of action by the Attorney General would be absurd.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> Based on this analysis, we disagree with the Sixth Circuit's reading of subsections (a)-(c). <i>See </i><i>Cain,</i> 583 F.3d at 414-15 (\"Congress did not enact language providing a default position . . . the statute does not read `the Attorney General shall have the authority to waive the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter.'\"). Subsections (a), (b), and (c) contain clear and directory language, and when statutory language is written as a clear directive, the rule is that, in the absence of limiting language, the statute is effective as of the date of its enactment. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Shenandoah,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></span>, 157-58 (3d Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Courts holding otherwise have read the language of this subsection as giving the Attorney General the exclusive authority to apply the registration requirements to any and <i>all</i> previously convicted sex offenders. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Hatcher,</i> 560 F.3d at 227. To arrive at this interpretation, those courts have surgically removed subsection (d) from the rest of the section and have read its text in a vacuum. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cain,</i> 583 F.3d at 414. We are unwilling to take so struthious an approach. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v.

Context must be considered  and contextual awareness is especially important when interpreting the provisions of a comprehensive regulatory scheme. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>FDA v.

Congress intended SORNA to function as such a scheme. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 16901 (stating that Congress sought to \"establish[] a comprehensive national system for the registration of [sex] offenders\"); <i>see also </i><i>May,</i> 535 F.3d at 919-20 (discussing Congressional intent to create regulatory scheme when enacting SORNA).</p>\n<p>When viewed as a part of a seamless regulatory scheme, subsection (d) has a distinct office: it appears to reflect Congress's recognition that specific applications of the registration requirements to previously convicted sex offenders may have unintended consequences. Thus, subsection (d) allows  but does not compel  the Attorney General to narrow SORNA's sweep if and to the extent that he concludes that specific situations invite such narrowing. Several contextual considerations support this view.</p>\n<p>First, it cannot be gainsaid that Congress enacted SORNA to \"establish[] a comprehensive national system for the registration of [sex] offenders.\" 42 U.S.C. § 16901. The Act defines a \"sex offender\" as \"an individual who <i>was</i> convicted of a sex offense.\" <i>Id.</i> § 16911(1) (emphasis supplied). It is significant that this past-tense definition makes no exceptions. <i>See </i><i>Hatcher,</i> 560 F.3d at 232 (Shedd, J., dissenting) (concluding that this past-tense usage \"expressly sweeps persons . . . convicted of sex offenses prior to SORNA's enactment within the statute's scope\"); <i>see also </i><i>Carr,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2236 (noting importance of Congress's choice of verb tense in interpreting statute's temporal reach).</p>\n<p>Second, the structure of section 16913 strongly suggests that this past-tense usage is not a scrivener's error. The office of subsection (a) is to ensure the registration of <i>all</i> sex offenders. Congress spoke <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> with conspicuous clarity in making subsection (a) all-encompassing: \"A sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides. . . .\" 42 U.S.C. § 16913(a). By the same token, neither subsection (b), which elaborates on initial registration requirements, nor subsection (c), which delineates continuing registration requirements, distinguishes between pre-SORNA and post-SORNA sex offense convictions. <i>See id.</i> § 16913(b)-(c); <i>see also </i><i>Hinckley,</i> 550 F.3d at 944 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Third, SORNA was tailored to fashion a comprehensive regulatory scheme. 42 U.S.C. § 16901. Construing subsection (d) to exempt a broad swath of the convicted sex offender population  indeed, the entirety of it, until the Attorney General acts  would fit uncomfortably with the remainder of the Act.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the title of subsection (d) specifies that the authority it describes relates to the \"[i]nitial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b).\" This language clearly indicates that the scope of the authority conferred upon the Attorney General by subsection (d) is limited to prescribing rules governing those offenders unable to comply with SORNA's initial registration requirements under subsection (b) and not pre-SORNA sex offenders more generally. <i>See </i><i>Hinckley,</i> 550 F.3d at 933.</p>\n<p>Some of the courts that have endorsed a contrary construction of subsection (d) have disregarded the title of the subsection based on the principle that courts only look to the title of a law in the event of ambiguity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cain,</i> 583 F.3d at 416; <i>Hatcher,</i> 560 F.3d at 226. But that principle does not pertain where, as here, an inquiring court's primary task is to place a statute in context before attempting to construe it. Thus, we do not use the title to \"undo or limit what the text makes plain.\" <i>Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v. Balt. &amp; Ohio R.R. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104439\"><a href=\"/opinion/104439/railroad-trainmen-v-b-or-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span>, 529, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104439\"><a href=\"/opinion/104439/railroad-trainmen-v-b-or-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1646</span></a></span> (1947).</p>\n<p>Fifth, the language of the second clause of subsection (d), which states that the Attorney General shall have the authority \"to prescribe rules . . . for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with subsection (b),\" informs our understanding of the first clause of subsection (d). The second clause suggests that the authority conferred by the first clause of subsection (d) was intended to extend only to those previously convicted offenders who were unable to comply with subsection (b), and not to previously convicted offenders more generally. The use of the word \"other\" in the second clause is most naturally read to indicate Congress's contemplation that the \"sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter\" referenced in the first clause will form one subset of \"offenders unable to comply with subsection (b).\" <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450368\"><a href=\"/opinion/450368/united-states-v-ven-fuel-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span>, 751-52 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"All words and provisions of statutes are intended to have meaning and are to be given effect, and no construction should be adopted which would render statutory words or phrases meaningless, redundant or superfluous.\"). This interpretation of the interaction between the two clauses of subsection (d) leaves intact the registration requirements articulated in subsection (a) and limits the applicability of subsection (d) to those offenders unable to comply with the requirements of subsection (b). <i>See </i><i>Hinckley,</i> 550 F.3d at 932.</p>\n<p>Sixth, and finally, our view of the scope of subsection (d) is informed by the way in which Congress chose to delegate authority to the Attorney General. The subsection provides that the Attorney General \"shall have the authority\" to determine the applicability of the requirements imposed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> by SORNA. 42 U.S.C. § 16913(d). It is thus apparent that the drafters eschewed the use of mandatory language (e.g., \"shall determine\") that would have compelled the Attorney General to make an affirmative determination before the statute could be applied to any previously convicted sex offender. In its use of permissive language, subsection (d) differs from other SORNA provisions in which Congress mandated action by the Attorney General. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> § 16917(b) (directing that \"the Attorney General <i>shall</i> prescribe rules for the notification of sex offenders\"). Congress's decision to couch some provisions of the statute in mandatory language but to couch subsection (d) in discretionary language is a telltale sign.<sup>[4]</sup><i>See </i><i>Duncan v. Walker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118447\"><a href=\"/opinion/118447/duncan-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 172-74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118447\"><a href=\"/opinion/118447/duncan-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2120</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118447\"><a href=\"/opinion/118447/duncan-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span> (2001). We think that this language says what it means and means what is says: that the Attorney General does not have to act before SORNA's registration requirements become effective as to previously convicted sex offenders. <i>See </i><i>Shenandoah,</i> 595 F.3d at 157-58.</p>\n<p>Congress obviously knew how to direct action by the Attorney General and how to give discretionary authority to him. In drafting subsection (d), Congress chose the latter course. We regard this choice as deliberate and, thus, as favoring a reading of subsection (d) as a grant to the Attorney General of discretion to provide limited relief from the broad requirements imposed by SORNA in order to account for problematic permutations that might arise with respect to some previously convicted sex offenders.</p>\n<p>These lampposts light the path that we must follow. The language, structure, and purpose of subsection (d) and the context in which it operates combine to show its unambiguous meaning. We hold that, in framing subsection (d), Congress did not contemplate a statutory scheme in which the application of the general rules limned in subsections (a), (b), and (c) to previously convicted sex offenders would hinge on action by the Attorney General.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>For purposes of the case at hand, this holding gets the grease from the goose. It teaches that the general rules requiring updates to sex offender registration took effect when SORNA was signed into law. Those requirements were thus in full force when, in February of 2007, the defendant traveled to a new state. When he failed to register there, he violated federal law. His prosecution for that offense poses no Ex Post Facto concerns.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> B. <i>Other Claims.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The defendant advances two other arguments. First, he maintains that Congress lacked power under the Commerce Clause to enact sex offender registration requirements. Second, he asseverates that his conviction infringes his rights under the Due Process Clause because it was impossible for him to comply with SORNA at the time of his interstate travel.<sup>[7]</sup> We address these arguments separately, mindful of our obligation to review constitutional challenges de novo. <i>United States v. Volungus,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>1. <i>Commerce Clause.</i> The Commerce Clause provides in pertinent part that \"[t]he Congress shall have Power To . . . regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8. The Supreme Court has described the extent of Congress's power to legislate under the Commerce Clause as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[W]e have identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power. First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, 558-59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span> (1995) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Keying to this test, the defendant launches an as-applied challenge. He argues that SORNA does not regulate the channels or instrumentalities of, persons in, or activities having a substantial effect on, interstate commerce. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Morrison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, 608-09, 613, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1624</span></a></span>. This argument fails because SORNA, as applied here, explicitly regulates the use of the channels of, and persons in, interstate commerce. Interstate travel is, after all, an express element of the SORNA violation with which the defendant was charged and of which he stands convicted. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a)(2)(B). That is all that is needed to satisfy the <i>Lopez</i> standard. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Guzman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2436\"><a href=\"/opinion/2436/united-states-v-guzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">591</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 89-91 (2d Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Given the presence of this element, the statute has a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce to survive the defendant's Commerce Clause challenge.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> 2. <i>Due Process.</i> The defendant's final argument is state-specific. He contends that because Rhode Island had not \"implemented\" SORNA at the time that he traveled interstate, he could not have complied with the law's registration requirements. Therefore, his conviction trespasses upon his right to due process.</p>\n<p>We need not tarry.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></span> (2010). We join that queue, pausing only to offer a decurtate statement of our reasoning.</p>\n<p>SORNA contains commands aimed at two different audiences: convicted sex offenders and states. Convicted sex offenders must register. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 16913. States must take various steps, such as maintaining a jurisdiction-wide sex offender registry, enacting criminal penalties for failures to register, and sharing information with other registries. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> §§ 16912(a), 16913(e), 16921(b). A state's failure to take these steps may lead to a loss of federal funds. <i>See id.</i> § 16925(a); <i>Gould,</i> 568 F.3d at 463 n. 1. Of critical importance, however, the registration requirements for sex offenders are neither conditioned on nor harnessed to state implementation of SORNA's state-directed mandates.</p>\n<p>In any event, by the time that Congress enacted SORNA, every state had a sex offender registration law in place. <i>See </i><i>Smith v. Doe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span> (2003). SORNA's registration requirements do not contemplate a specific type of registration; they merely require a sex offender to \"register. . . in each jurisdiction where the offender resides.\" 42 U.S.C. § 16913(a). Registration in accordance with a preexisting state sex offender registration law satisfies SORNA. <i>See </i><i>Griffey,</i> 589 F.3d at 1366 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p>This construct makes good sense given SORNA's office as a mechanism for identifying sex offenders who otherwise might slip through the cracks and elude state-by-state registration requirements by moving across state lines. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 16901; <i>see also</i> National Guidelines for Sex Offender Registration and Notification, 73 Fed.Reg. 38,030, 38,030 (July 2, 2008) (explaining that SORNA was enacted to \"eliminate potential gaps and loopholes under the pre-existing standards by means of which sex offenders could attempt to evade registration requirements\"). The result is that, as long as a state maintains a registration mechanism for sex offenders, what the state does or does not do with respect to implementing its state-specific obligations under SORNA is not relevant to a sex offender's obligation to register. <i>See </i><i>Gould,</i> 568 F.3d at 465.</p>\n<p>This dichotomy creates no unfairness here. Although Rhode Island may not have fully complied with its responsibilities under SORNA at the time of the defendant's federal crime, it did maintain a sex offender registry. The defendant could  and should  have registered there, as local <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> police directed him to do. It follows that there was no due process violation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we uphold the district court's well-reasoned refusal to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>Judge Selya's decision for the panel lays out lucidly the reasons why the statutory language and canons of constructionalways the first resort in interpretation support applying the statute to the defendant. It may be useful to underscore two further points: that the statute's design leans against the narrow reading adopted by several other circuits and that Congress' purpose supports the broader one that we adopt today.</p>\n<p>National standards for sex offender registration have existed since 1994, when the Congress provided federal funding to states that enacted sex offender registration laws. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 14071. By the time that the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), Pub.L. No. 109-248, tit. I, 120 Stat. 590 (42 U.S.C. § 16901 <i>et seq.</i>), was signed into law on July 27, 2006, every stateincluding Massachusetts and Rhode Islandhad enacted a sex offender registration law. <i>See</i> National Guidelines for Sex Offender Registration and Notification, 73 Fed.Reg. 38,030, 38,030 (July 2, 2008); <i>see also </i><i>Smith v. Doe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

No. 109-218, pt. 1, at 23. Senator Cantwell explained: \"Child sex offenders have exploited this stunning lack of uniformity, and the consequences have been tragic. Twenty percent of the Nation's 560,000 sex offenders are `lost' because State offender registry programs are not coordinated well enough.\" 152 Cong. Rec. S8020 (daily ed. July 20, 2006). SORNA's aim, repeated throughout the debate in Congress, was to impose on this patchwork a uniform, \"comprehensive\" federal registration statute. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 16901; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Hinckley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"171479\"><a href=\"/opinion/171479/united-states-v-hinckley/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span>, 947 (10th Cir.2008) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>SORNA pressed stateson pain of losing federal fundingto adopt new federal standards in their own sex offender registration programs. 42 U.S.C. § 16925. In addition, it directly imposed new federal registration obligations on sex offenders and provided for federal enforcement of those obligations. 42 U.S.C. §§ 16913-16917. What is important to the case before us is that Congress intended the enforcement provisions to apply of their own force to those who had previously been convicted and not just to newly convicted offenders.</p>\n<p>The House Judiciary Committee report on an earlier version of SORNA explained that SORNA would address the \"strong public interest in finding\" previously convicted offenders who were not currently registered \"and having them register with current information to mitigate the risks of additional crimes against children.\" H.R.Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, at 24. Similarly, Senator Kyl explained: \"There currently are over 100,000 sex offenders in this country who are required to register but are `off the system.' They are not registered. The penalties in this bill should be adequate to ensure that <i>these individuals</i> register.\" 152 Cong. Rec. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> S8025 (daily ed. July 20, 2006) (emphasis added); <i>accord id.</i> at S8013 (Sen. Hatch).</p>\n<p>Consonantly, the SORNA provision on registry requirements for sex offenders has a single opening paragraph, titled \"In general,\" that directs all \"sex offender[s]\" to register and to keep their registration current, 42 U.S.C. § 16913(a), and SORNA defines the term sex offender as \"an individual who <i>was</i> convicted of a sex offense,\" <i>id.</i> § 16911(1) (emphasis added). Subsection (a), without exempting offenders with convictions before SORNA came into force, provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote>A sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender is a student. For initial registration purposes only, a sex offender shall also register in the jurisdiction in which convicted if such jurisdiction is different from the jurisdiction of residence.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 16913(a).</p>\n<p>The provision, central to achieving SORNA's objectives, is manifestly remedial in purposenot punitive. This is borne out by the evident reason for requiring registration in the first place, which is to prevent further crimes, by the statements in Congress to the same effect, and by the placement of the registration provisions in 42 U.S.C. rather than the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. There is no presumption against or prohibition on making remedial measures apply to preexisting circumstances. <i>See </i><i>Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>SORNA also adopted criminal enforcement provisions, one of which punishes someone who after SORNA was enacted travels in interstate commerce but fails to register in a new state of residence within a fixed period. 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a); 42 U.S.C. § 16913; <i>see </i><i>Carr v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"147527\"><a href=\"/opinion/147527/carr-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2229</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"147527\"><a href=\"/opinion/147527/carr-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1152</span></a></span> (2010). Here, DiTomassopreviously registered in Massachusetts as a sex offendertraveled in interstate commerce after July 27, 2006, and then failed to register in Rhode Island even though expressly advised of his obligation to register.</p>\n<p>At this point, one might wonder why there is any problem at all with DiTomasso's conviction. The problem arises because in SORNA, Congress adopted not only the blanket requirement of subsection (a), but also a more detailed provision dealing with initial registration (subsection (b)); and a provision titled \"Initial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b)\" (subsection (d)). The latter, drafted in language somewhat opaque at first, reads:</p>\n<blockquote>(d) Initial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b) The Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before July 27, 2006 or its implementation in a particular jurisdiction, and to prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offenders and for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with subsection (b).</blockquote>\n<p>42 U.S.C. § 16913(d).</p>\n<p>Since both the heading and the main internal cross reference in the text\"offenders who are unable to comply with subsection (b)\"relate to subsection (b), one could read subsection (d) as confined to certain problems, mainly dealing with timing, that Congress foresaw as to initial registration.<sup>[9]</sup> But there is also some evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> that might support subsection (d) as allowing the Attorney General to qualify the blanket applicability of subsection (a) itself if special problems arose in applying the statute to pre-SORNA convicts.</p>\n<p>Yet if subsection (d) were read to apply to matters other than initial registration, it still does <i>not</i> say that SORNA exempts those convicted before SORNA unless and until the Attorney General so determines. It is perfectly fair to read subsections (a) and (d) together so thatabsent contrary action by the Attorney GeneralSORNA applies to one convicted before SORNA but who \"travels\" afterwards and refuses to register. That is the way the Attorney General himself reads the statute.<sup>[10]</sup><i>See</i> Applicability of SORNA, 72 Fed.Reg. 8894 (Feb. 28, 2007) (codified at 28 C.F.R. § 72.3).</p>\n<p>A contrary reading would suppose that Congress left those with pre-SORNA convictions free from registration requirements unless and until the Attorney General got around to regulating; in principle, such a reading would allow him not to regulate them at all. This is hardly consistent with Congress' emphatic purpose to advance the \"strong public interest in finding\" and imposing registration requirements on those already convicted before SORNA itself.</p>\n<p>Some very capable judges appear initially to have viewed the matter differently, but, with respect, there is nothing in text or history that forbids reading subsection (a) as fully applicable unless and until the Attorney General limits or qualifies it so far as subsection (d) might permit; and, even if the language could read either way, this is the reading most consistent with Congress' central purpose.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The record does not indicate an exact date, but the government, at least provisionally, acknowledges that the defendant's interstate travel occurred before February 27, 2007.</p>\n<p>[2]  There is a discrepancy between the United States Code and the United States Code Annotated with respect to the language of 42 U.S.C. § 16913. The version printed in the United States Code Annotated contains the words \"of this section\" in subsections (c) and (d) when cross-referencing other subsections of the provision, but the version printed in the United States Code does not. We quote here the version in the United States Code, as it is the official version of the statute. This difference, however, has absolutely no bearing on the substance of our discussion.</p>\n<p>[3]  An example would be an offender who had been convicted of a sex offense but was not required to register (or could not register) under any state law prior to SORNA's enactment. <i>See</i> 72 Fed.Reg. at 8896.</p>\n<p>[4]  We note that the phrase \"shall have the authority\" is typically used, elsewhere in the United States Code, to denote a grant of authority to perform a discretionary act. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 6 U.S.C. § 112(b)(2) (stating that Secretary of Homeland Security \"shall have the authority to make contracts\"); 12 U.S.C. § 3907(a)(2) (stating that federal banking regulators \"shall have the authority\" to set minimum capital requirements); 16 U.S.C. § 459j-2(d) (stating that Secretary of the Interior \"shall have the authority\" to condemn property); <i>see also </i><i>Cain,</i> 583 F.3d at 427-30 (Griffin, J., dissenting) (cataloguing judicial interpretations of similar discretionary provisions).</p>\n<p>[5]  The interim rule promulgated by the Attorney General indicates that this interpretation is correct. It states that \"[t]his rule <i>forecloses</i>\" claims that the Attorney General must first act before SORNA applies. 72 Fed.Reg. at 8896 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>[6]  The defendant argues only that his prosecution under SORNA violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because it penalized him for conduct (interstate travel) that occurred prior to the date that SORNA applied to him. He does not raise the related, but distinct, claim that the overall applicability of SORNA presents an Ex Post Facto Clause problem because SORNA imposes punishment for a preexisting crime. We therefore do not address this second issue here.</p>\n<p>[7]  In supplemental briefing, the defendant tried to raise a further argument: that the Attorney General's promulgation of the interim rule violated the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553. This argument was available to the defendant when he filed his opening brief (indeed, he made it below), so it falls within the familiar rule that issues not advanced in an appellant's opening brief are deemed waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vázquez-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201585\"><a href=\"/opinion/201585/united-states-v-vazquez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 487-88 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542293\"><a href=\"/opinion/542293/richard-l-sandstrom-etc-v-chemlawn-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>[8]  The defendant suggests that the registration requirement contained in 42 U.S.C. § 16913 itself exceeds Congress's power under the Commerce Clause. This suggestion is incorrect. The Necessary and Proper Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 18, provides Congress with ample authority to regulate local activity as part of a general scheme regulating interstate commerce. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Guzman,</i> 591 F.3d at 91; <i>United States v. Whaley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"67078\"><a href=\"/opinion/67078/united-states-v-whaley/\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 260-61 (5th Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Ambert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78312\"><a href=\"/opinion/78312/united-states-v-ambert/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1202</span></a></span>, 1211-12 (11th Cir.2009); <i>see also </i><i>Volungus,</i> 595 F.3d at 5-6.</p>\n<p>[9]  Importantly, state initial registration requirements, varying from one state to another, could in various circumstances have made it infeasible for those convicted prior to SORNA to have registered in the manner and within the time limits now prescribed by SORNA's subsection (b) requirements. <i>See</i> Interim Rule on the Applicability of SORNA, 72 Fed.Reg. 8894, 8896 (Feb. 28, 2007) (codified at 28 C.F.R. § 72.3).</p>\n<p>[10]  In certain circumstances, the reading of an official charged with administering an ambiguous statute is entitled to substantial deference so long as it is linguistically permissible, <i>see </i><i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 842-45, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1984); in other circumstances, it has persuasive force, <i>see </i><i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104034\"><a href=\"/opinion/104034/skidmore-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 140, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></span> (1944). In <i>Carr,</i> the Supreme Court rejected the Attorney General's reading of a separate SORNA provision, but there, the statutory term in issue\"travels\"did arguably directly conflict with the Attorney General's reading. Here, \"authority to specify\" says nothing express about whether the subsection (a) operates with full force if the Attorney General declines to exercise his authority.</p>\n\n</div>",
