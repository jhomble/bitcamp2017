BABCOCK, IN HER CAPACITY AS EXECUTRIX\n    OF THE ESTATE OF PAUL A.

This appeal is taken by\n\ndefendant-appellant       General   Motors     Corporation   (\"GM\")   from   an\n\nadverse jury verdict in favor of plaintiff-appellee Frances A.\n\nBabcock as executrix of the estate of Paul A. Babcock, III, and\n\nindividually.         The case arose from an accident on February 21,\n\n1998, when a General Motors pickup truck driven by Paul A. Babcock,\n\nIII, went off the road and struck a tree.              The accident rendered\n\nBabcock a paraplegic.         On June 15, 1999, Babcock died as a result\n\nof complications from his injuries.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n               Plaintiff brought suit alleging negligence and strict\n\nliability against the defendant.              The jury returned a verdict\n\nfinding GM liable on the negligence count and not liable on the\n\nstrict liability count.         It is undisputed that when Babcock was\n\nfirst seen after the accident his seat belt was not fastened around\n\nhim.    The complaint alleged that Babcock was wearing his seat belt\n\nprior to the accident, but that the belt unbuckled as soon as\n\npressure was exerted on it and the buckle released due to a\n\ncondition known as \"false latching.\"            The main focus of the trial\n\nwas on this claim of false latching.\n\n               Three main issues are before us: (1) whether the verdict\n\nshould    be    set   aside   because   it    was   internally   inconsistent;\n\n(2) whether GM forfeited its objection to the alleged inconsistency\n\nbecause of its failure to follow the requirements of Rules 49(b)\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fand 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as applied by this\n\ncourt; and (3) whether the evidence was sufficient to support the\n\nverdict of liability based on negligence.      We affirm the judgment\n\nbelow.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n            A.   The Claim of Inconsistent Verdicts\n\n            GM advances a series of arguments to the effect that the\n\njury's verdict on the negligence count is invalid and cannot stand:\n\n(1) as a matter of law, in the absence of a defect in the product,\n\nGM could not be found liable for negligence; (2) thus, the verdicts\n\nwere inconsistent; (3) the inconsistency in the verdicts was caused\n\nby    the   district   court's   erroneous   jury   instructions;   and\n\n(4) plaintiff's failure to appeal the verdict in favor of GM on the\n\nstrict liability claim precludes entry of judgment for plaintiff on\n\nthe negligence claim and mandates entry of judgment for GM.\n\n            None of these arguments or variations thereof was made in\n\nthe trial court.       During the discussions on the proposed jury\n\ncharge, the trial judge discussed the Verdict Form with counsel on\n\ntwo separate occasions.     GM did not object to the form on either\n\noccasion.    The Verdict Form on liability submitted to the jury\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fstated:\n\n                       SPECIAL VERDICT FORM\n\n          1. Has plaintiff proved her negligence claim\n          by a preponderance of the evidence?\n\n                        X\n                       Yes               No\n\n          2. Has plaintiff proved her product liability\n          claim by a preponderance of the evidence?\n\n                                         X\n                       Yes               No\n\n          [Answer questions 3 and 4 only if you have\n          answered yes to question 1 and/or 2]\n\n          Although the Verdict Form is entitled \"Special Verdict\n\nForm,\" it seems clear that it was not a true \"special verdict,\" as\n\ndescribed in Rule 49(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nRule 49(a) states:   \"The court may require a jury to return only a\n\nspecial verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each\n\nissue of fact.\"   Here, for example, a special verdict form would\n\nhave included questions such as whether Babcock was wearing his\n\nseatbelt at the time of the accident.    When such a form is used,\n\nthe jury makes only findings of fact; it is up to the court to\n\napply the law.    See 9A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 2503, at 155-56 (2d ed. 1994).   It\n\nseems clear that this is not the type of verdict form used in this\n\ncase.\n\n          Rule 49(b), which addresses general verdicts, states:\n\n\"The court may submit to the jury, together with appropriate forms\n\n                                -4-\n\ffor a general verdict, written interrogatories upon one or more\n\nissues of fact the decision of which is necessary to a verdict.\"\n\nThis is the type of form used in this case:     the jury returned a\n\nverdict against GM, and also answered specific interrogatories\n\ndesigned to channel its deliberations, focusing its attention on\n\nthe crucial issues that it had to resolve in order to decide which\n\nparty should prevail.1   See Wright & Miller, supra, § 2511, at 217\n\n& n.1 (discussing the purpose of Rule 49(b)).   The last sentence of\n\nRule 49(b) specifically discusses inconsistent answers to questions\n\nsubmitted to the jury:    \"When the answers are inconsistent with\n\neach other and one or more is likewise inconsistent with the\n\ngeneral verdict, judgment shall not be entered, but the court shall\n\nreturn the jury for further consideration of its answers and\n\nverdict or shall order a new trial.\"\n\n          We have held that under Rule 49(b), objections to the\n\ninconsistency of verdicts must be made after the verdict is read\n\nand before the jury is discharged.     E.g., Merchant v. Ruhle, 740\n\nF.2d 86, 89 (1st Cir. 1984); Skillin v. Kimball, 643 F.2d 19, 19-20\n\n(1st Cir. 1981). Consistent with those precedents, we hold that GM\n\n\n\n     1\n       In the alternative, the jury's answers to the questions on\nthe verdict form could be described as two general verdicts. See\nMerchant v. Ruhle, 740 F.2d 86, 88-89 (1st Cir. 1984). We need not\ndetermine which label is correct because the result is the same\nregardless.    As we explain below, objections to allegedly\ninconsistent special interrogatories must be raised before the jury\nis discharged. The same is true for allegedly inconsistent general\nverdicts. See id. at 91-92.\n\n                                -5-\n\fforfeited its objection to the alleged inconsistency by failing to\n\nobject at the critical time.            See McIsaac v. Didriksen Fishing\n\nCorp., 809 F.2d 129, 134 (1st Cir. 1987).                   To decide otherwise\n\nwould countenance 'agreeable acquiescence to perceivable error as\n\na weapon of appellate advocacy.'\"             Id. (quoting Merchant, 740 F.2d\n\nat 92). Consequently, unless there is plain error, we cannot grant\n\nrelief   on    GM's   claim   that   the      jury's   inconsistent    liability\n\nfindings rendered invalid its finding that GM was negligent.                    We\n\naddress the issue of plain error below.\n\n              Our finding of forfeiture is reinforced by GM's failure\n\nto object properly to the jury instructions, which made clear that\n\nthe jury could return a verdict in Babcock's favor if it found\n\neither negligence or a design defect.                  Cf. Toucet v. Maritime\n\nOverseas   Corp.,     991   F.2d   5,   9     (1st   Cir.   1993)   (noting   that\n\ndefendant \"should have been alerted to the potential inconsistency\n\nby the jury instructions,\" which stated that the plaintiff could\n\nrecover if on \"one or both\" of her negligence and unseaworthiness\n\nclaims).      Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides\n\nin pertinent part:      \"no party may assign as error the giving or the\n\nfailure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto\n\nbefore the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly\n\nthe matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\"               We point\n\nout that during the pre-charge conference on the proposed jury\n\ninstructions, the district court alerted counsel that in order to\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fpreserve objections to the charge they had to object as required\n\nunder the rule.     Rule 51 has been stringently enforced to the\n\nextent that a district court judge cannot waive it even with the\n\nacquiescence of counsel.    Poulin v. Greer, 18 F.3d 979, 982 (1st\n\nCir. 1994); Smith v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., 877 F.2d 1106, 1109 (1st\n\nCir. 1989); McGrath v. Spirito, 733 F.2d 967, 969 (1st Cir. 1984)\n\n(\"[Rule 51] is binding on both the court and attorneys and neither\n\ncan   circumvent   it.\").   And,   of    critical   importance    to   GM's\n\nposition, a failure to object as required by Rule 51 deprives the\n\nnon-objecting party of review under Rule 61, either before the\n\ntrial court on a post-trial motion or on appeal.                 Scarfo v.\n\nCabletron Sys., Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 941 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           There is nothing in the record from which it can be found\n\neither directly or inferentially that GM objected to the submission\n\nto the jury of both the negligence and strict liability claims.          In\n\nfact, defense counsel treated the submission of both claims as\n\nroutine procedure. GM's only objection after argument and prior to\n\nthe jury's retiring for deliberations was as follows:\n\n           COUNSEL FOR GM: I just want to reiterate the\n           comments that we had before that the court\n           prepared the charge on the issue of defective\n           design versus testing.\n\n           THE COURT: All right. That your argument is\n           that this does not include a negligence\n           testing claim, and . . . you've adequately\n           preserved that argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           Evidently, the district court understood GM to be arguing\n\n(as it had during an earlier conference) that Babcock's claim of\n\nnegligent testing was not properly in the case because it was not\n\nincluded in the Amended Complaint.                Nothing in GM's post-charge\n\ncomments raised the claim of possible verdict inconsistency it\n\npresses on appeal.        We conclude that those brief comments did not\n\nsatisfy the requirements of Rule 51.\n\n           The only exception to nullification of appellate issues\n\nfor failure to follow Rule 51 is the plain error doctrine.                    Smith\n\nv. Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 28-29 (1st Cir. 1999).                   Reversal under\n\nthat doctrine requires that (1) there be error; (2) the error was\n\n\"plain\" (i.e. obvious and clear under current law); (3) the error\n\naffected   substantial         rights;    and    (4)   the    error    threatened   a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.          Danco, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 178\n\nF.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 1999).                We have applied the plain error\n\ndoctrine \"stringently\" in civil cases.                 Id.    Accordingly, we will\n\ngrant relief on an issue that has been forfeited on appeal only \"to\n\nprevent a clear miscarriage of justice . . . or where the error\n\nseriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"          Romano v. U-Haul Int'l, 233 F.3d 655, 664\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nWe might find plain error where \"'the failure to raise the claim\n\nbelow      deprived        the        reviewing          court        of    helpful\n\nfactfinding;   .      .    .    the      issue    is    one    of     constitutional\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fmagnitude;       .        .     .      the     omitted       argument    is     highly\n\npersuasive;      .        .     .     the     opponent      would   suffer     special\n\nprejudice; . . . and, perhaps most importantly, . . . the issue is\n\nof great importance to the public.'\"                  Id. (quoting Play Time, Inc.\n\nv. LDDS Metromedia Communications, Inc., 123 F.3d 23, 30 n.8 (1st\n\nCir. 1997) (alterations in original).                      None of these factors is\n\npresent in this case.\n\n             We examine New Hampshire law to determine whether there\n\nwas plain error below.               If New Hampshire law forbade combining a\n\ncount in negligence with a count in strict liability in a tort\n\ncase, the plain error doctrine might be applicable.                            But New\n\nHampshire law does not prohibit submitting both negligence and\n\nstrict liability claims to the jury.                   See, e.g., Cyr v. J.I. Case\n\nCo., 652 A.2d 685, 693 (N.H. 1995); Thibault v. Sears, Roebuck &\n\nCo., 395 A.2d 843, 849 (N.H. 1978); Greenland v. Ford Motor Co.,\n\nInc., 347 A.2d 159, 163 (N.H. 1975).                  The most that can be said is\n\nthat submission of both claims is frowned upon. Thibault, 395 A.2d\n\nat 849 (\"While . . . both counts are permitted, we do not recommend\n\nto plaintiffs that counts in both negligence and strict liability\n\nbe   submitted       to   the       jury    because   of   the   confusion    which   is\n\ncreated.\"); see also Greenland, 347 A.2d at 163.                        We will not\n\ncreate a general rule of prohibition in light of the New Hampshire\n\nSupreme Court's reluctance to do so.                  We rule that it was not plain\n\n\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\ferror to submit counts in both negligence and strict liability to\n\nthe jury.\n\n            The same is true for GM's claim that the verdict is\n\ninternally inconsistent and its related argument that the jury's\n\nfinding of negligence is invalid as a matter of law in light of its\n\ndetermination that there was no design defect.     Both claims are\n\nbased on the premise that a design defect is an essential element\n\nof negligence under New Hampshire law.      We need not determine\n\nwhether that proposition is correct -- it is enough to conclude, as\n\nwe do, that New Hampshire law is not so clear on the question that\n\nit was plain error for the district court to enter judgment on the\n\njury's verdict.    See Stancill v. McKenzie Tank Lines, Inc., 497\n\nF.2d 529, 535 (5th Cir. 1974) (\"Confronted with no objection to the\n\nverdict or answers, it was not plain error for the district court\n\nto enter judgment upon the verdict as it did.\").   In denying GM’s\n\nmotions for a new trial and judgment as a matter of law, the\n\ndistrict court clearly and thoughtfully explained:\n\n            I deny the motion and offer the following\n            comments in addition to the explanations I\n            gave when I made the rulings to which General\n            Motors objects: (1) General Motors was\n            represented by highly skilled counsel and it\n            was apparent to me that counsel understood at\n            the final pretrial conference and throughout\n            the trial that the plaintiff was asserting a\n            claim for negligent testing; (2) General\n            Motors has waived any claim that the special\n            verdict form was unacceptable by failing to\n            object at a time when I could have taken\n            corrective action; and (3) General Motors has\n            waived any claim that the verdicts are\n\n                                -10-\n\f           inconsistent because I gave it an opportunity\n           to assert such a claim before I discharged the\n           jury and it declined to make its argument at a\n           time when I could have taken corrective\n           action. I determine that oral argument on the\n           motion is unnecessary because the issues have\n           been well briefed. Motion denied.\n\nWe agree with the district court and affirm its denial of the\n\nmotions.\n\n           B.   The Evidence\n\n           GM argues that there was an absence of evidence that\n\nBabcock was wearing his seat belt at the time of the accident.   It\n\npoints out that no one saw a seat belt on him immediately after the\n\naccident. GM also argues that although Babcock himself was covered\n\nwith blood and blood was on the interior of the cab of the truck,\n\nno blood was on the seat belt straps.\n\n           Plaintiff did not challenge these facts, but claimed that\n\nshe would prove by habit or custom evidence that Babcock always\n\nwore a seat belt when he drove a motor vehicle.   The district court\n\nruled that such evidence would be allowed and that the question of\n\nwhether Babcock was wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident\n\nwas for the jury.   GM objected to this ruling.   At the time of the\n\ncourt's ruling, GM offered no case law to support its position and\n\nits brief cites no cases holding that habit or custom evidence\n\ncould not be used to prove seat belt use under the facts of this\n\ncase.   It is well-established that habit evidence may be used to\n\nprove a person’s conduct on a particular occasion:     \"Evidence of\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fthe habit of a person . . . whether corroborated or not and\n\nregardless of the presence of eyewitnesses, is relevant to prove\n\nthat the conduct of the person . . . on a particular occasion was\n\nin conformity with the habit . . . .\"      Fed. R. Evid. 406; see also\n\nUnited States v. Newman, 982 F.2d 665, 668 (1st Cir. 1992).2\n\n           We   recount   testimony   by   three   of   the   plaintiff’s\n\nwitnesses, all of whom described Babcock’s habitual seat belt use.\n\nErnest Babcock, brother of the decedent, testified that he drove\n\nwith his brother, Paul Babcock, at least ten to twenty times a year\n\nfrom 1972 to 1998.    George Clausen, Paul Babcock’s neighbor, had\n\nknown him for about a year and a half prior to the accident and had\n\nridden with him about a dozen times.         Judith Hobbs Jackson had\n\nknown Babcock since the two were children.     She had ridden with him\n\neight to twelve times over the last several years, most of these\n\ntimes with Babcock as the driver.       All three witnesses testified\n\nthat Babcock always wore his seat belt, regardless of whether he\n\nwas the driver or a passenger and regardless of the length of the\n\ntrip.    Jackson also testified that Babcock always put on his seat\n\nbelt before the vehicle in which he was riding started.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       In contrasting habit evidence with character evidence, the\nEditorial Explanatory Comment to Rule 406 provides an example of a\nperson’s habitual seat belt use as more probative evidence that the\nperson was wearing a seat belt on a particular occasion than\nevidence that the person is generally a safety-oriented person.\nFed. R. Evid. § 406.02, cmt.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f          We rule that the district court did not err in submitting\n\nto the jury the question of whether Babcock was wearing his seat\n\nbelt immediately prior to the impact of the truck with the tree.\n\nWe also note that GM did not object to the jury instructions on\n\nthis issue as required under Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.\n\n          GM also objects to the evidence with respect to the\n\ntestimony of plaintiff's expert, Dr. Malcolm Newman.              GM attacks\n\nthe testimony   on   the   ground   that   its    admission   violated   the\n\nprinciples established in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509\n\nU.S. 579 (D.C. Cir. 1993).\n\n          In Daubert the Court rejected the rule stated in Frye v.\n\nUnited States, 293 F. 1013, 1014 (1923), that \"expert opinion based\n\non a scientific technique is inadmissible unless the technique is\n\n'generally   accepted'     as   reliable   in    the   relevant   scientific\n\ncommunity.\" Daubert 509 U.S. at 584 (citation omitted). The Court\n\nput the responsibility for the admission or exclusion of scientific\n\nor expert evidence on the trial judge:\n\n              That the Frye test was displaced by the\n          Rules of Evidence does not mean, however, that\n          the Rules themselves place no limits on the\n          admissibility   of   purportedly    scientific\n          evidence.   Nor is the trial judge disabled\n          from screening such evidence.          To the\n          contrary, under the Rules the trial judge must\n          ensure that any and all scientific testimony\n          or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but\n          reliable.\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f               The primary locus of this obligation is\n           Rule 702, which clearly contemplates some\n           degree of regulation of the subjects and\n           theories about which an expert may testify.\n           \"If    scientific,   technical,    or    other\n           specialized knowledge will assist the trier of\n           fact to understand the evidence or to\n           determine a fact in issue\" an expert \"may\n           testify thereto.\"\n\nId. at 589 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).          The Court\n\nfurther stated:\n\n              Faced with a proffer of expert scientific\n           testimony,   then,   the   trial  judge   must\n           determine at the outset, pursuant to Rule\n           104(a), whether the expert is proposing to\n           testify to (1) scientific knowledge that\n           (2) will assist the trier of fact to\n           understand or determine a fact in issue. This\n           entails a preliminary assessment of whether\n           the reasoning or methodology underlying the\n           testimony is scientifically valid and of\n           whether that reasoning or methodology properly\n           can be applied to the facts in issue.\n\nId. at 592-93 (footnotes omitted).\n\n           The   penultimate   paragraph   summarizes   the   holding   of\n\nDaubert:\n\n              To summarize: \"General acceptance\" is not\n           a necessary precondition to the admissibility\n           of scientific evidence under the Federal Rules\n           of    Evidence,     but    the     Rules    of\n           Evidence–especially Rule 702–do assign to the\n           trial judge the task of ensuring that an\n           expert's testimony both rests on a reliable\n           foundation and is relevant to the task at\n           hand.       Pertinent   evidence    based   on\n           scientifically valid principles will satisfy\n           those demands.\n\nId. at 597.\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\f          It is apparent to us that the expert's testimony met the\n\nstandards set forth in Daubert.       The evidence admitted was both\n\nrelevant and reliable.     The district court followed Rule 104(a) of\n\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence and determined that the expert's\n\ntestimony would assist the trier of fact in understanding or\n\ndetermining the facts in issue.      Id. at 592.    And under Rule 702\n\nthe district court ensured that the expert's testimony rested on a\n\nreliable foundation and was relevant to the task at hand.\n\n          We   rehearse    the   testimony   of   Dr.   Malcolm   Newman,\n\nplaintiff's expert.       Dr. Newman specializes in structural and\n\nmechanical engineering and has a Ph.D. from New York University.\n\nHe provides consultation to clients mainly on matters involving\n\nlitigation.    From 1971 to 1975 he was a tenured full professor at\n\nTel Aviv University in Israel.     He is a certified diplomate of the\n\nAmerican Board of Forensic Examiners and has authored sixty-five\n\narticles in his field.        He has been greatly involved in the\n\nanalysis of restraint systems in automobiles.\n\n          Based on photos and other materials given to him, Dr.\n\nNewman formed an opinion as to how fast the Babcock vehicle was\n\ntraveling when it hit the tree.      He explained to the jury, using\n\nthe photos and other materials furnished to him, the analysis he\n\nfollowed to determine the speed at time of impact.           Dr. Newman\n\ntestified that the technology he used to determine the \"impact\n\nspeed\" is one accepted by all recognized accident reconstruction\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fspecialists and that the methodology he followed was accepted by\n\nthe   National   Highway    Traffic    Safety   Administration.   In   Dr.\n\nNewman's opinion, the \"impact\" speed was between twenty and twenty-\n\nfive miles per hour.       He also was of the opinion that the Babcock\n\ntruck was traveling at a speed of between thirty-five and forty\n\nmiles per hour when it left the highway.        Dr. Newman also explained\n\nto the jury how he arrived at this estimate.\n\n           In Dr. Newman’s opinion, at an impact speed of twenty-\n\nfive miles per hour, a properly belted occupant would be fully\n\nprotected by the seat belt.        Dr. Newman opined that Babcock was\n\neither not wearing a seat belt or the seat belt was defective.\n\nFrom examining the seat belt itself, Dr. Newman concluded that it\n\nhad been used just prior to impact.\n\n           Using the seat belt found in the cab of the truck, Dr.\n\nNewman explained to the jury his opinion as to how the seat belt\n\ndisengaged upon impact.       He eliminated a manufacturing defect and\n\n\"inertial release\"3 as causes for the unbuckling of the seat belt.\n\nHe testified that in his opinion, the seat belt unbuckled because\n\nof false latching, otherwise known as \"partial engagement.\"\n\n           With the aid of photos, the accident seat belt, and\n\nanother similar seat belt, Dr. Newman demonstrated how false\n\nlatching can occur. In false latching the occupant thinks that the\n\n\n      3\n        Inertial release is prompted by sudden changes in\nacceleration or deceleration and might cause a belt to unlatch in\nan accident.\n\n                                      -16-\n\fbelt is fully latched but in reality, it is not.                 Moreover,\n\naccording to Dr. Newman, both falsely latched and fully latched\n\nseat belts trigger the same signals in the vehicle as to whether\n\nthe seat belt is in use.\n\n          Dr. Newman characterized a false latch propensity as a\n\ndesign defect.    He used a schematic drawing to explain in detail\n\nall of the latch mechanisms in a safety belt buckle.            Dr. Newman\n\ntestified that because of the design of a GM belt buckle, continued\n\nuse of the buckle increases the danger of false latching.          Using a\n\nVolvo seat belt buckle, he demonstrated that its design eliminated\n\nthe risk that false latching would occur.      He noted that the buckle\n\non the GM truck was tested pursuant to section 209 of the Federal\n\nMotor Vehicle Safety Standards.\n\n          Dr.    Newman   testified   about   the   testing    safety   belt\n\nbuckles must undergo.       He concluded that the GM buckle could\n\ndevelop false latching due to normal wear and tear.           He was of the\n\nopinion that there was no testing for false latching.           Dr. Newman\n\nconcluded his direct testimony by opining that the probable cause\n\nof the lack of seat belt restraint on Babcock after the accident\n\nwas false latching.\n\n          Dr. Newman’s testimony could be found by the jury to be\n\nrelevant and reliable.    We hold that the trial court did not err by\n\nallowing the jury to hear it.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f          The other arguments made by appellant do not merit\n\ndiscussion.\n\n          The judgment below is affirmed.   Costs on appeal awarded\n\nto plaintiff.\n\n\n\n\n                              -18-\n\f",

Babcock as executrix of the estate of Paul A. Babcock, III, and individually. The case arose from an accident on February 21, 1998, when a General Motors pickup truck driven by Paul A. Babcock, III, went off the road and struck a tree. The accident rendered Babcock a paraplegic. On June 15, 1999, Babcock died as a result of complications from his injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff brought suit alleging negligence and strict liability against the defendant. The jury returned a verdict finding GM liable on the negligence count and not liable on the strict liability count. It is undisputed that when Babcock was first seen after the accident his seat belt was not fastened around him. The complaint alleged that Babcock was wearing his seat belt prior to the accident, but that the belt unbuckled as soon as pressure was exerted on it and the buckle released due to a condition known as \"false latching.\" The main focus of the trial was on this claim of false latching.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three main issues are before us: (1) whether the verdict should be set aside because it was internally inconsistent; (2) whether GM forfeited its objection to the alleged inconsistency because of its failure to follow the requirements of Rules 49(b) and 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as applied by this court; and (3) whether the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict of liability based on negligence. We affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. <i>DISCUSSION</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Claim of Inconsistent Verdicts</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GM advances a series of arguments to the effect that the jury's verdict on the negligence count is invalid and cannot stand: (1) as a matter of law, in the absence of a defect in the product, GM could not be found liable for negligence; (2) thus, the verdicts were inconsistent; (3) the inconsistency in the verdicts was caused by the district court's erroneous jury instructions; <i>and</i> (4) plaintiff's failure to appeal the verdict in favor of GM on the strict liability claim precludes entry of judgment for plaintiff on the negligence claim and mandates entry of judgment for GM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of these arguments or variations thereof was made in the trial court. During the discussions on the proposed jury charge, the trial judge discussed the Verdict Form with counsel on two separate occasions. GM did not object to the form on either occasion. The Verdict Form on liability submitted to the jury stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>SPECIAL VERDICT FORM</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Has plaintiff proved her negligence claim by a preponderance of the evidence?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <pre>          X\n        -----      -----\n         Yes         No</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Has plaintiff proved her product liability claim by a preponderance of the evidence?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <pre>                     X\n        -----      -----\n         Yes         No</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Answer questions 3 and 4 only if you have answered yes to question 1 and/or 2]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Verdict Form is entitled \"Special Verdict Form,\" it seems clear that it was not a true \"special verdict,\" as described in Rule 49(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 49(a) states: \"The court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue of fact.\" Here, for example, a special verdict form would have included questions such as whether Babcock was wearing his seat-belt at the time of the accident. When such a form is used, the jury makes only findings of fact; it is up to the court to apply the law. <i>See</i> 9A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 2503, at 155-56 (2d ed.1994). It seems clear that this is not the type of verdict form used in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 49(b), which addresses general verdicts, states: \"The court may submit to the jury, together with appropriate forms for a general verdict, written interrogatories upon one or more issues of fact the decision of which is necessary to a verdict.\" This is the type of form used in this case: the jury returned a verdict against GM, and also answered specific interrogatories designed to channel its deliberations, focusing its attention on the crucial issues that it had to resolve in order to decide which party should prevail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See</i> Wright &amp; Miller, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 2511, at 217 &amp; n.1 (discussing the purpose of Rule 49(b)). The last sentence of Rule 49(b) specifically discusses inconsistent answers to questions submitted to the jury: \"When the answers are inconsistent with each other and one or more is likewise inconsistent with the general verdict, judgment shall not be entered, but the court shall return the jury for further consideration of its answers and verdict or shall order a new trial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that under Rule 49(b), objections to the inconsistency of verdicts must be made after the verdict is read and before the jury is discharged. <i>E.g., Merchant v. Ruhle,</i> 740 F.2d 86, 89 (1st Cir.1984); <i>Skillin v. Kimball,</i> 643 F.2d 19, 19-20 (1st Cir.1981). Consistent with those precedents, we hold that GM forfeited its objection to the alleged inconsistency by failing to object at the critical time. <i>See McIsaac v. Didriksen Fishing Corp.,</i> 809 F.2d 129, 134 (1st Cir.1987). \"To decide otherwise would countenance `agreeable acquiescence to perceivable error as a weapon of appellate advocacy.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Merchant,</i> 740 F.2d at 92). Consequently, unless there is plain error, we cannot grant relief on GM's claim that the jury's inconsistent liability findings rendered invalid its finding that GM was negligent. We address the issue of plain error below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our finding of forfeiture is reinforced by GM's failure to object properly to the jury instructions, which made clear that the jury could return a verdict in Babcock's favor if it found either negligence or a design defect. <i>Cf. Toucet v. Maritime Overseas Corp.,</i> 991 F.2d 5, 9 (1st Cir.1993) (noting that defendant \"should have been alerted to the potential inconsistency by the jury instructions,\" which stated that the plaintiff could recover if on \"one or both\" of her negligence and unseaworthiness claims). Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in pertinent part: \"no party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\" We point out that during the pre-charge conference on the proposed jury instructions, the district court alerted counsel that in order to preserve objections to the charge they had to object as required under the rule. Rule 51 has been stringently enforced to the extent that a district court judge cannot waive it even with the acquiescence of counsel. <i>Poulin v. Greer,</i> 18 F.3d 979, 982 (1st Cir.1994); <i>Smith v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,</i> 877 F.2d 1106, 1109 (1st Cir.1989); <i>McGrath v. Spirito,</i> 733 F.2d 967, 969 (1st Cir.1984) (\"[Rule 51] is binding on both the court and attorneys and neither can circumvent it.\"). And, of critical importance to GM's position, a failure to object as required by Rule 51 deprives the non-objecting party of review under Rule 61, either before the trial court on a post-trial motion or on appeal. <i>Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc.,</i> 54 F.3d 931, 941 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing in the record from which it can be found either directly or inferentially that GM objected to the submission to the jury of both the negligence and strict liability claims. In fact, defense counsel treated the submission of both claims as routine procedure. GM's only objection after argument and prior to the jury's retiring for deliberations was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">COUNSEL FOR GM: I just want to reiterate the comments that we had before that the court prepared the charge on the issue of defective design versus testing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: All right. That your argument is that this does not include a negligence testing claim, and ... you've adequately preserved that argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidently, the district court understood GM to be arguing (as it had during an earlier conference) that Babcock's claim of negligent testing was not properly in the case because it was not included in the Amended Complaint. Nothing in GM's post-charge comments raised the claim of possible verdict inconsistency it presses on appeal. We conclude that those brief comments did not satisfy the requirements of Rule 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only exception to nullification of appellate issues for failure to follow Rule 51 is the plain error doctrine. <i>Smith v. Kmart Corp.,</i> 177 F.3d 19, 28-29 (1st Cir.1999). Reversal under that doctrine requires that (1) there be error; (2) the error was \"plain\" (i.e. obvious and clear under current law); (3) the error affected substantial rights; and (4) the error threatened a miscarriage of justice. <i>Danco, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> 178 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir.1999). We have applied the plain error doctrine \"stringently\" in civil cases. <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, we will grant relief on an issue that has been forfeited on appeal only \"to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice ... or where the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Romano v. U-Haul Int'l,</i> 233 F.3d 655, 664 (1st Cir.2000) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We might find plain error where \"`the failure to raise the claim below deprived the reviewing court of helpful factfinding; ... the issue is one of constitutional magnitude; ... the omitted argument is highly persuasive; ... the opponent would suffer special prejudice;... and, perhaps most importantly, ... the issue is of great importance to the public.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Play Time, Inc. v. LDDS Metromedia Communications, Inc.,</i> 123 F.3d 23, 30 n. 8 (1st Cir.1997) (alterations in original)). None of these factors is present in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We examine New Hampshire law to determine whether there was plain error below. If New Hampshire law forbade combining a count in negligence with a count in strict liability in a tort case, the plain error doctrine might be applicable. But New Hampshire law does not prohibit submitting both negligence and strict liability claims to the jury. <i>See, e.g., Cyr v. J.I. Case Co.,</i> 139 N.H. 193, 652 A.2d 685, 693 (N.H.1995); <i>Thibault v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> 118 N.H. 802, 395 A.2d 843, 849 (N.H.1978); <i>Greenland v. Ford Motor Co., Inc.,</i> 115 N.H. 564, 347 A.2d 159, 163 (N.H.1975). The most that can be said is that submission of both claims is frowned upon. <i>Thibault,</i> 395 A.2d at 849 (\"While... both counts are permitted, we do not recommend to plaintiffs that counts in both negligence and strict liability be submitted to the jury because of the confusion which is created.\"); <i>see also Greenland,</i> 347 A.2d at 163. We will not create a general rule of prohibition in light of the New Hampshire Supreme Court's reluctance to do so. We rule that it was not plain error to submit counts in both negligence and strict liability to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same is true for GM's claim that the verdict is internally inconsistent and its related argument that the jury's finding of negligence is invalid as a matter of law in light of its determination that there was no design defect. Both claims are based on the premise that a design defect is an essential element of negligence under New Hampshire law. We need not determine whether that proposition is correct &#8212; it is enough to conclude, as we do, that New Hampshire law is not so clear on the question that it was plain error for the district court to enter judgment on the jury's verdict. <i>See Stancill v. McKenzie Tank Lines, Inc.,</i> 497 F.2d 529, 535 (5th Cir.1974) (\"Confronted with no objection to the verdict or answers, it was not plain error for the district court to enter judgment upon the verdict as it did.\"). In denying GM's motions for a new trial and judgment as a matter of law, the district court clearly and thoughtfully explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I deny the motion and offer the following comments in addition to the explanations I gave when I made the rulings to which General Motors objects: (1) General Motors was represented by highly skilled counsel and it was apparent to me that counsel understood at the final pretrial conference and throughout the trial that the plaintiff was asserting a claim for negligent testing; (2) General Motors has waived any claim that the special verdict form was unacceptable by failing to object at a time when I could have taken corrective action; and (3) General Motors has waived any claim that the verdicts are inconsistent because I gave it an opportunity to assert such a claim before I discharged the jury and it declined to make its argument at a time when I could have taken corrective action. I determine that oral argument on the motion is unnecessary because the issues have been well briefed. Motion denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court and affirm its denial of the motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GM argues that there was an absence of evidence that Babcock was wearing his seat belt at the time of the accident. It points out that no one saw a seat belt on him immediately after the accident. GM also argues that although Babcock himself was covered with blood and blood was on the interior of the cab of the truck, no blood was on the seat belt straps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff did not challenge these facts, but claimed that she would prove by habit or custom evidence that Babcock always wore a seat belt when he drove a motor vehicle. The district court ruled that such evidence would be allowed and that the question of whether Babcock was wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident was for the jury. GM objected to this ruling. At the time of the court's ruling, GM offered no case law to support its position and its brief cites no cases holding that habit or custom evidence could not be used to prove seat belt use under the facts of this case. It is well-established that habit evidence may be used to prove a person's conduct on a particular occasion: \"Evidence of the habit of a person ... whether corroborated or not and regardless of the presence of eyewitnesses, is relevant to prove that the conduct of the person ... on a particular occasion was in conformity with the habit....\" Fed.R.Evid. 406; <i>see also United States v. Newman,</i> 982 F.2d 665, 668 (1st Cir.1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount testimony by three of the plaintiff's witnesses, all of whom described Babcock's habitual seat belt use. Ernest Babcock, brother of the decedent, testified that he drove with his brother, Paul Babcock, at least ten to twenty times a year from 1972 to 1998. George Clausen, Paul Babcock's neighbor, had known him for about a year and a half prior to the accident and had ridden with him about a dozen times. Judith Hobbs Jackson had known Babcock since the two were children. She had ridden with him eight to twelve times over the last several years, most of these times with Babcock as the driver. All three witnesses testified that Babcock always wore his seat belt, regardless of whether he was the driver or a passenger and regardless of the length of the trip. Jackson also testified that Babcock always put on his seat belt before the vehicle in which he was riding started.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rule that the district court did not err in submitting to the jury the question of whether Babcock was wearing his seat belt immediately prior to the impact of the truck with the tree. We also note that GM did not object to the jury instructions on this issue as required under Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GM also objects to the evidence with respect to the testimony of plaintiff's expert, Dr. Malcolm Newman. GM attacks the testimony on the ground that its admission violated the principles established in <i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc.,</i> 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (D.C.Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Daubert</i> the Court rejected the rule stated in <i>Frye v. United States,</i> 293 F. 1013, 1014 (1923), that \"expert opinion based on a scientific technique is inadmissible unless the technique is `generally accepted' as reliable in the relevant scientific community.\" <i>Daubert</i> 509 U.S. at 584, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (citation omitted). The Court put the responsibility for the admission or exclusion of scientific or expert evidence on the trial judge:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the <i>Frye</i> test was displaced by the Rules of Evidence does not mean, however, that the Rules themselves place no limits on the admissibility of purportedly scientific evidence. Nor is the trial judge disabled from screening such evidence. To the contrary, under the Rules the trial judge must ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary locus of this obligation is Rule 702, which clearly contemplates some degree of regulation of the subjects and theories about which an expert may testify. \"<i>If scientific,</i> technical, or other specialized <i>knowledge will assist the trier of fact</i> to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue\" an expert \"may testify <i>thereto.</i>\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).

This entails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The penultimate paragraph summarizes the holding of <i>Daubert:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize: \"General acceptance\" is not a necessary precondition to the admissibility of scientific evidence under the Federal Rules of Evidence, but the Rules of Evidence-especially Rule 702-do assign to the trial judge the task of ensuring that an expert's testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.

The district court followed Rule 104(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence and determined that the expert's testimony would assist the trier of fact in understanding or determining the facts in issue. <i>Id.</i> at 592, 113 S.Ct. 2786. And under Rule 702 the district court ensured that the expert's testimony rested on a reliable foundation and was relevant to the task at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rehearse the testimony of Dr. Malcolm Newman, plaintiff's expert. Dr. Newman specializes in structural and mechanical engineering and has a Ph.D. from New York University. He provides consultation to clients mainly on matters involving litigation. From 1971 to 1975 he was a tenured full professor at Tel Aviv University in Israel. He is a certified diplomate of the American Board of Forensic Examiners and has authored sixty-five articles in his field. He has been greatly involved in the analysis of restraint systems in automobiles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on photos and other materials given to him, Dr. Newman formed an opinion as to how fast the Babcock vehicle was traveling when it hit the tree. He explained to the jury, using the photos and other materials furnished to him, the analysis he followed to determine the speed at time of impact. Dr. Newman testified that the technology he used to determine the \"impact speed\" is one accepted by all recognized accident reconstruction specialists and that the methodology be followed was accepted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In Dr. Newman's opinion, the \"impact\" speed was between twenty and twenty-five miles per hour. He also was of the opinion that the Babcock truck was traveling at a speed of between thirty-five and forty miles per hour when it left the highway. Dr. Newman also explained to the jury how he arrived at this estimate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Dr. Newman's opinion, at an impact speed of twenty-five miles per hour, a properly belted occupant would be fully protected by the seat belt. Dr. Newman opined that Babcock was either not wearing a seat belt or the seat belt was defective. From examining the seat belt itself, Dr. Newman concluded that it had been used just prior to impact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using the seat belt found in the cab of the truck, Dr. Newman explained to the jury his opinion as to how the seat belt disengaged upon impact. He eliminated a manufacturing defect and \"inertial release\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> as causes for the unbuckling of the seat belt. He testified that in his opinion, the seat belt unbuckled because of false latching, otherwise known as \"partial engagement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the aid of photos, the accident seat belt, and another similar seat belt, Dr. Newman demonstrated how false latching can occur. In false latching the occupant thinks that the belt is fully latched but in reality, it is not. Moreover, according to Dr. Newman, both falsely latched and fully latched seat belts trigger the same signals in the vehicle as to whether the seat belt is in use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Newman characterized a false latch propensity as a design defect. He used a schematic drawing to explain in detail all of the latch mechanisms in a safety belt buckle. Dr. Newman testified that because of the design of a GM belt buckle, continued use of the buckle increases the danger of false latching. Using a Volvo seat belt buckle, he demonstrated that its design eliminated the risk that false latching would occur. He noted that the buckle on the GM truck was tested pursuant to section 209 of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Newman testified about the testing safety belt buckles must undergo. He concluded that the GM buckle could develop false latching due to normal wear and tear. He was of the opinion that there was no testing for false latching. Dr. Newman concluded his direct testimony by opining that the probable cause of the lack of seat belt restraint on Babcock after the accident was false latching.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Newman's testimony could be found by the jury to be relevant and reliable. We hold that the trial court did not err by allowing the jury to hear it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other arguments made by appellant do not merit discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The judgment below is affirmed.

Babcock as executrix of the estate of Paul A. Babcock, III, and individually. The case arose from an accident on February 21, 1998, when a General Motors pickup truck driven by Paul A. Babcock, III, went off the road and struck a tree. The accident rendered Babcock a paraplegic. On June 15, 1999, Babcock died as a result of complications from his injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff brought suit alleging negligence and strict liability against the defendant. The jury returned a verdict finding GM liable on the negligence count and not liable on the strict liability count. It is undisputed that when Babcock was first seen after the accident his seat belt was not fastened around him. The complaint alleged that Babcock was wearing his seat belt prior to the accident, but that the belt unbuckled as soon as pressure was exerted on it and the buckle released due to a condition known as \"false latching.\" The main focus of the trial was on this claim of false latching.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three main issues are before us: (1) whether the verdict should be set aside because it was internally inconsistent; (2) whether GM forfeited its objection to the alleged inconsistency because of its failure to follow the requirements of Rules 49(b) and 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as applied by this court; and (3) whether the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict of liability based on negligence. We affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. <i>DISCUSSION</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Claim of Inconsistent Verdicts</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GM advances a series of arguments to the effect that the jury's verdict on the negligence count is invalid and cannot stand: (1) as a matter of law, in the absence of a defect in the product, GM could not be found liable for negligence; (2) thus, the verdicts were inconsistent; (3) the inconsistency in the verdicts was caused by the district court's erroneous jury instructions; <i>and</i> (4) plaintiff's failure to appeal the verdict in favor of GM on the strict liability claim precludes entry of judgment for plaintiff on the negligence claim and mandates entry of judgment for GM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of these arguments or variations thereof was made in the trial court. During the discussions on the proposed jury charge, the trial judge discussed the Verdict Form with counsel on two separate occasions. GM did not object to the form on either occasion. The Verdict Form on liability submitted to the jury stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>SPECIAL VERDICT FORM</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Has plaintiff proved her product liability claim by a preponderance of the evidence?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <pre>                     X\n        -----      -----\n         Yes         No</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Answer questions 3 and 4 only if you have answered yes to question 1 and/or 2]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Verdict Form is entitled \"Special Verdict Form,\" it seems clear that it was not a true \"special verdict,\" as described in Rule 49(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 49(a) states: \"The court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue of fact.\" Here, for example, a special verdict form would have included questions such as whether Babcock was wearing his seat-belt at the time of the accident. When such a form is used, the jury makes only findings of fact; it is up to the court to apply the law. <i>See</i> 9A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 2503, at 155-56 (2d ed.1994). It seems clear that this is not the type of verdict form used in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 49(b), which addresses general verdicts, states: \"The court may submit to the jury, together with appropriate forms for a general verdict, written interrogatories upon one or more issues of fact the decision of which is necessary to a verdict.\" This is the type of form used in this case: the jury returned a verdict against GM, and also answered specific interrogatories designed to channel its deliberations, focusing its attention on the crucial issues that it had to resolve in order to decide which party should prevail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See</i> Wright &amp; Miller, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 2511, at 217 &amp; n.1 (discussing the purpose of Rule 49(b)). The last sentence of Rule 49(b) specifically discusses inconsistent answers to questions submitted to the jury: \"When the answers are inconsistent with each other and one or more is likewise inconsistent with the general verdict, judgment shall not be entered, but the court shall return the jury for further consideration of its answers and verdict or shall order a new trial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that under Rule 49(b), objections to the inconsistency of verdicts must be made after the verdict is read and before the jury is discharged. <i>E.g., Merchant v. Ruhle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439210\"><a href=\"/opinion/439210/james-p-merchant-v-philip-henry-ruhle/\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 89 (1st Cir.1984); <i>Skillin v.

Consistent with those precedents, we hold that GM forfeited its objection to the alleged inconsistency by failing to object at the critical time. <i>See McIsaac v. Didriksen Fishing Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481636\"><a href=\"/opinion/481636/james-r-mcisaac-v-didriksen-fishing-corp-appeal-of-the-wise-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 134 (1st Cir.1987). \"To decide otherwise would countenance `agreeable acquiescence to perceivable error as a weapon of appellate advocacy.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Merchant,</i> 740 F.2d at 92). Consequently, unless there is plain error, we cannot grant relief on GM's claim that the jury's inconsistent liability findings rendered invalid its finding that GM was negligent. We address the issue of plain error below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our finding of forfeiture is reinforced by GM's failure to object properly to the jury instructions, which made clear that the jury could return a verdict in Babcock's favor if it found either negligence or a design defect. <i>Cf. Toucet v. Maritime Overseas Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604816\"><a href=\"/opinion/604816/angel-toucet-v-maritime-overseas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1993) (noting that defendant \"should have been alerted to the potential inconsistency by the jury instructions,\" which stated that the plaintiff could recover if on \"one or both\" of her negligence and unseaworthiness claims). Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in pertinent part: \"no party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\" We point out that during the pre-charge conference on the proposed jury instructions, the district court alerted counsel that in order to preserve objections to the charge they had to object as required under the rule. Rule 51 has been stringently enforced to the extent that a district court judge cannot waive it even with the acquiescence of counsel. <i>Poulin v.

And, of critical importance to GM's position, a failure to object as required by Rule 51 deprives the non-objecting party of review under Rule 61, either before the trial court on a post-trial motion or on appeal. <i>Scarfo v.

In fact, defense counsel treated the submission of both claims as routine procedure. GM's only objection after argument and prior to the jury's retiring for deliberations was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">COUNSEL FOR GM: I just want to reiterate the comments that we had before that the court prepared the charge on the issue of defective design versus testing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: All right.

Nothing in GM's post-charge comments raised the claim of possible verdict inconsistency it presses on appeal. We conclude that those brief comments did not satisfy the requirements of Rule 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only exception to nullification of appellate issues for failure to follow Rule 51 is the plain error doctrine. <i>Smith v.

Reversal under that doctrine requires that (1) there be error; (2) the error was \"plain\" (i.e. obvious and clear under current law); (3) the error affected substantial rights; and (4) the error threatened a miscarriage of justice. <i>Danco, Inc. v.

We have applied the plain error doctrine \"stringently\" in civil cases. <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, we will grant relief on an issue that has been forfeited on appeal only \"to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice ... or where the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Romano v.

We might find plain error where \"`the failure to raise the claim below deprived the reviewing court of helpful factfinding; ... the issue is one of constitutional magnitude; ... the omitted argument is highly persuasive; ... the opponent would suffer special prejudice;... and, perhaps most importantly, ... the issue is of great importance to the public.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Play Time, Inc. v.

If New Hampshire law forbade combining a count in negligence with a count in strict liability in a tort case, the plain error doctrine might be applicable. But New Hampshire law does not prohibit submitting both negligence and strict liability claims to the jury. <i>See, e.g., Cyr v. J.I.

The most that can be said is that submission of both claims is frowned upon. <i>Thibault,</i> 395 A.2d at 849 (\"While... both counts are permitted, we do not recommend to plaintiffs that counts in both negligence and strict liability be submitted to the jury because of the confusion which is created.\"); <i>see also Greenland,</i> 347 A.2d at 163. We will not create a general rule of prohibition in light of the New Hampshire Supreme Court's reluctance to do so.

Both claims are based on the premise that a design defect is an essential element of negligence under New Hampshire law. We need not determine whether that proposition is correct &#8212; it is enough to conclude, as we do, that New Hampshire law is not so clear on the question that it was plain error for the district court to enter judgment on the jury's verdict. <i>See Stancill v.

It points out that no one saw a seat belt on him immediately after the accident. GM also argues that although Babcock himself was covered with blood and blood was on the interior of the cab of the truck, no blood was on the seat belt straps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff did not challenge these facts, but claimed that she would prove by habit or custom evidence that Babcock always wore a seat belt when he drove a motor vehicle. The district court ruled that such evidence would be allowed and that the question of whether Babcock was wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident was for the jury. GM objected to this ruling. At the time of the court's ruling, GM offered no case law to support its position and its brief cites no cases holding that habit or custom evidence could not be used to prove seat belt use under the facts of this case. It is well-established that habit evidence may be used to prove a person's conduct on a particular occasion: \"Evidence of the habit of a person ... whether corroborated or not and regardless of the presence of eyewitnesses, is relevant to prove that the conduct of the person ... on a particular occasion was in conformity with the habit....\" Fed.R.Evid. 406; <i>see also United States v.

Ernest Babcock, brother of the decedent, testified that he drove with his brother, Paul Babcock, at least ten to twenty times a year from 1972 to 1998. George Clausen, Paul Babcock's neighbor, had known him for about a year and a half prior to the accident and had ridden with him about a dozen times. Judith Hobbs Jackson had known Babcock since the two were children. She had ridden with him eight to twelve times over the last several years, most of these times with Babcock as the driver. All three witnesses testified that Babcock always wore his seat belt, regardless of whether he was the driver or a passenger and regardless of the length of the trip. Jackson also testified that Babcock always put on his seat belt before the vehicle in which he was riding started.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rule that the district court did not err in submitting to the jury the question of whether Babcock was wearing his seat belt immediately prior to the impact of the truck with the tree.

Dr. Newman specializes in structural and mechanical engineering and has a Ph.D. from New York University. He provides consultation to clients mainly on matters involving litigation. From 1971 to 1975 he was a tenured full professor at Tel Aviv University in Israel. He is a certified diplomate of the American Board of Forensic Examiners and has authored sixty-five articles in his field. He has been greatly involved in the analysis of restraint systems in automobiles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on photos and other materials given to him, Dr. Newman formed an opinion as to how fast the Babcock vehicle was traveling when it hit the tree. He explained to the jury, using the photos and other materials furnished to him, the analysis he followed to determine the speed at time of impact. Dr. Newman testified that the technology he used to determine the \"impact speed\" is one accepted by all recognized accident reconstruction specialists and that the methodology be followed was accepted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In Dr. Newman's opinion, the \"impact\" speed was between twenty and twenty-five miles per hour. He also was of the opinion that the Babcock truck was traveling at a speed of between thirty-five and forty miles per hour when it left the highway. Dr. Newman also explained to the jury how he arrived at this estimate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Dr. Newman's opinion, at an impact speed of twenty-five miles per hour, a properly belted occupant would be fully protected by the seat belt. Dr. Newman opined that Babcock was either not wearing a seat belt or the seat belt was defective. From examining the seat belt itself, Dr. Newman concluded that it had been used just prior to impact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using the seat belt found in the cab of the truck, Dr. Newman explained to the jury his opinion as to how the seat belt disengaged upon impact. He eliminated a manufacturing defect and \"inertial release\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> as causes for the unbuckling of the seat belt. He testified that in his opinion, the seat belt unbuckled because of false latching, otherwise known as \"partial engagement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the aid of photos, the accident seat belt, and another similar seat belt, Dr. Newman demonstrated how false latching can occur. In false latching the occupant thinks that the belt is fully latched but in reality, it is not. Moreover, according to Dr. Newman, both falsely latched and fully latched seat belts trigger the same signals in the vehicle as to whether the seat belt is in use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Newman characterized a false latch propensity as a design defect. He used a schematic drawing to explain in detail all of the latch mechanisms in a safety belt buckle. Dr. Newman testified that because of the design of a GM belt buckle, continued use of the buckle increases the danger of false latching. Using a Volvo seat belt buckle, he demonstrated that its design eliminated the risk that false latching would occur. He noted that the buckle on the GM truck was tested pursuant to section 209 of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Newman testified about the testing safety belt buckles must undergo. He concluded that the GM buckle could develop false latching due to normal wear and tear. He was of the opinion that there was no testing for false latching. Dr. Newman concluded his direct testimony by opining that the probable cause of the lack of seat belt restraint on Babcock after the accident was false latching.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Newman's testimony could be found by the jury to be relevant and reliable. We hold that the trial court did not err by allowing the jury to hear it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other arguments made by appellant do not merit discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The judgment below is affirmed.
