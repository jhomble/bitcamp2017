Counts III and\n\nIV's allegations  are themselves  extreme, and  are so  fully\n\nanswered by the magistrate judge as confirmed by the district\n\ncourt  and by what  we say, incidentally,  hereafter, that we\n\nwill give  them no  further specific  attention.   The  other\n\nclaims are more difficult, as are often questions of judgment\n\nwhen summary  disposition is  sought.  Cf.  Wallace v.  Shade\n                                                             \n\nTobacco Growers Agric. Ass'n., Inc.,  642 F.2d 17, 19-20 (1st\n                                   \n\nCir.  1981).   At the  same time,  although our review  is de\n                                                             \n\nnovo, Rivera-Marcano v.  Normeat Royal Dane Quality  A/S, 998\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  34, 37  (1st Cir. 1993),  we may  be slow to  reverse a\n\nmagistrate's careful conclusions, thoughtfully  reviewed.  In\n\n                             -2-\n\nthis case  we almost entirely  agree with what has  been said\n\nbelow and we affirm.\n\n          First, some  dates.   On November  11, 1988  Cesare\n\nForcucci,  son of plaintiffs Carmen and Theresa Forcucci, was\n\ninjured in  a single vehicle  accident, dying  the next  day.\n\nThere  was at  first  a  question whether  he,  or one  Darin\n\nGoodwin, was driving.  On April 26, 1989, plaintiffs' counsel\n\nnotified  defendant of the  accident, and requested  the full\n\nmedical  coverage of  $10,000,  due  regardless  of  who  was\n\ndriving.   Nothing  was said  about UIM.   On June  1 counsel\n\nwrote  with respect to  UIM that Goodwin's  $100,000 coverage\n\nwith Travelers was insufficient.  Defendant paid the medical.\n\nIn late September Travelers, evidently conceding that Goodwin\n\nhad  been the  driver,  offered the  full $100,000  under its\n\npolicy, and thereafter  paid it.   On November 9  plaintiffs'\n\ncounsel  wrote defendant that  Goodwin had been  convicted on\n\nOctober 5 of motor  vehicle homicide, thus resolving the  UIM\n\nissue,  and  repeated  his demand  for  defendant's  full UIM\n\n$100,000.  Included was a handwritten Victim Impact Statement\n\nthat Theresa  Forcucci had  submitted to  the criminal  court\n\nprior to  Goodwin's sentencing,  describing the  effects upon\n\nher of her son's loss.\n\n          On  November  28,  having  received  no   response,\n\nplaintiffs'  counsel, by fax, asked  defendant why it did not\n\nrespond.   On December  4, having received  no reply, counsel\n\n                             -3-\n\ntelephoned  defendant and  was  told  that  it  was  awaiting\n\ncompletion  of  its  investigation  into the  possibility  of\n\nplaintiffs  making a  claim against  the  nightclub that  had\n\nsupplied  Goodwin with alcoholic  beverages.  Asked  why this\n\nwas  relevant, defendant's claim representative could give no\n\nanswer.  On December 5  plaintiffs mailed a demand letter for\n\nunfair  settlement practices pursuant to G.L. c. 93A,   9(3).\n\nThis  extensive  letter  referred, inter  alia,  to  a recent\n                                              \n\nMassachusetts  case, Bertassi v. Allstate Ins. Co., 402 Mass.\n                                                  \n\n366, 522  N.E.2d  949 (1988),  that  held that  an  insurer's\n\ninvestigation of possible  dram shop liability was  no excuse\n\nfor delay.  The certified  receipt shows that this letter was\n\nreceived on December 11.  Defendant replied by fax on January\n\n11, 1990, offering $25,000 in full settlement.  On January 18\n\ncounsel  replied by certified  mail that $25,000  was grossly\n\ninadequate  and  stating  that  plaintiffs  were  instituting\n\narbitration proceedings  forthwith  pursuant  to  the  policy\n\nprovisions.\n\n          Plaintiffs' first  claim is that  defendant's offer\n\nwas  not  \"prompt,\"  one  of   the  four  objections  to  the\n\nmagistrate's  report, because  it was made  31 days  from the\n\ndate of its receipt of  plaintiffs' December 5 letter, rather\n\nthan within 30.   Thirty days is a  statutory period relating\n\nto a defendant's  opportunity to receive Ch.  93A protection,\n\nMass. G.L. c. 93A,   9(3),  not to the statutory  requirement\n\n                             -4-\n\nof a reasonably prompt response.  Mass. G.L. c. 176D,   3(9).\n\nEspecially with the holiday season interference we accept the\n\nmagistrate's conclusion that 31 days was reasonably prompt as\n\nmatter of law.1\n\n          The  more serious question is whether $25,000 was a\n\nreasonable offer.   The  magistrate found it  was on  the low\n\nside, but  reasonable as matter of law.  In agreeing with him\n\nwe stress two factors; one, perhaps more than he did, and one\n\nthat he  did not  stress at all.   Negotiating  a settlement,\n\nparticularly when  the damages  are unliquidated,  is, to  an\n\nextent,  a legitimate bargaining  process.  The  statute does\n\nnot call for defendant's final offer, but only one within the\n\nscope of reasonableness.  Experienced negotiators do not make\n\ntheir final offer  first off, and experienced  negotiators do\n\nnot expect it, or take seriously a representation that it is.\n\nIndeed, plaintiffs say as much  in now intimating that  their\n\nown $100,000  policy limits offer  was not final in  spite of\n\nthe fact that, in several talks, they refused to reduce it.\n\n          The  reasonableness of a defendant's response is to\n\nbe considered  in the light of the  situation as a whole, one\n\naspect  of  which   was  the  size  of   plaintiffs'  demand.\n\n                    \n\n1.  We   further  ask,   if  plaintiffs   consider   30  days\nappropriate, may not a fax on the 31st day be equivalent to a\nletter mailed on the 30th?\n\n                             -5-\n\nPlaintiffs'  demand was very  high.2  Ordinary  give and take\n\nwould suggest that both would and should move.  Defendant was\n\nnot ever given that opportunity, even when it traded  against\n\nitself,  as  shown  in  the   magistrate's  report.    As  to\n\ndefendant's alleged bad faith, this  is not a case like Whyte\n                                                             \n\nv. Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co.,  818 F.2d 1005 (1st Cir.\n                                   \n\n1987).  \n\n          We  have   only  one   problem,  the   last  minute\n\nexpression  of  defendant's  legal   department's  fear  that\n\n$100,000  would be  a likely  outcome.   How  over-large that\n\nopinion  might be is  indicated by the  arbitrator's finding.\n\nSee  n.2,  ante.    This  brings  us  to  Theresa  Forcucci's\n               \n\nextensive victim  impact statement,  submitted in support  of\n\nher claim herein.   With the greatest respect  for a bereaved\n\nmother who has suffered a great tragedy, a jury's response is\n\nnot necessarily predictable.   Defendant's legal department's\n\nbelief that a jury might give it great weight did not destroy\n\nthe  reasonableness of the claim department's opinion that it\n\nmight not.   Two  different views could  both be  reasonable.\n\nApprehensions  did  not  make the  lower  offer unreasonable,\n\nparticularly where, in dollars, that offer was the nearer  to\n\nthe arbitrator's finding.\n\n                    \n\n2.  In saying this we may look at the arbitrator's finding of\n$55,000.  Plaintiffs'  complaint of  the magistrate's  giving\nweight  hereto  overlooks that the statute  expressly permits\nit.  Mass.  G.L. c. 176D,   3(9)(8)G.   Their contention that\nhe accepted it out of hand is incorrect.\n\n                             -6-\n\n          We  accept   the  magistrate's   recommendation  in\n\nsubstance, and affirm the district court.\n\n                             -7-\n",

The certified  receipt shows that this letter was\n\nreceived on December 11.  Defendant replied by fax on January\n\n11, 1990, offering $25,000 in full settlement.  On January 18\n\ncounsel  replied by certified  mail that $25,000  was grossly\n\ninadequate  and  stating  that  plaintiffs  were  instituting\n\narbitration proceedings  forthwith  pursuant  to  the  policy\n\nprovisions.\n\n          Plaintiffs' first  claim is that  defendant's offer\n\nwas  not  \"prompt,\"  one  of   the  four  objections  to  the\n\nmagistrate's  report, because  it was made  31 days  from the\n\ndate of its receipt of  plaintiffs' December 5 letter, rather\n\nthan within 30.   Thirty days is a  statutory period relating\n\nto a defendant's  opportunity to receive Ch.  93A protection,\n\nMass. G.L. c. 93A,   9(3),  not to the statutory  requirement\n\n                             -4-\n\nof a reasonably prompt response.  Mass. G.L. c. 176D,   3(9).\n\nEspecially with the holiday season interference we accept the\n\nmagistrate's conclusion that 31 days was reasonably prompt as\n\nmatter of law.1\n\n          The  more serious question is whether $25,000 was a\n\nreasonable offer.   The  magistrate found it  was on  the low\n\nside, but  reasonable as matter of law.  In agreeing with him\n\nwe stress two factors; one, perhaps more than he did, and one\n\nthat he  did not  stress at all.   Negotiating  a settlement,\n\nparticularly when  the damages  are unliquidated,  is, to  an\n\nextent,  a legitimate bargaining  process.  The  statute does\n\nnot call for defendant's final offer, but only one within the\n\nscope of reasonableness.  Experienced negotiators do not make\n\ntheir final offer  first off, and experienced  negotiators do\n\nnot expect it, or take seriously a representation that it is.\n\nIndeed, plaintiffs say as much  in now intimating that  their\n\nown $100,000  policy limits offer  was not final in  spite of\n\nthe fact that, in several talks, they refused to reduce it.\n\n          The  reasonableness of a defendant's response is to\n\nbe considered  in the light of the  situation as a whole, one\n\naspect  of  which   was  the  size  of   plaintiffs'  demand.\n\n                    \n\n1.  We   further  ask,   if  plaintiffs   consider   30  days\nappropriate, may not a fax on the 31st day be equivalent to a\nletter mailed on the 30th?\n\n                             -5-\n\nPlaintiffs'  demand was very  high.2  Ordinary  give and take\n\nwould suggest that both would and should move.  Defendant was\n\nnot ever given that opportunity, even when it traded  against\n\nitself,  as  shown  in  the   magistrate's  report.    As  to\n\ndefendant's alleged bad faith, this  is not a case like Whyte\n                                                             \n\nv. Connecticut Mutual Life Ins.

How  over-large that\n\nopinion  might be is  indicated by the  arbitrator's finding.\n\nSee  n.2,  ante.    This  brings  us  to  Theresa  Forcucci's\n               \n\nextensive victim  impact statement,  submitted in support  of\n\nher claim herein.   With the greatest respect  for a bereaved\n\nmother who has suffered a great tragedy, a jury's response is\n\nnot necessarily predictable.   Defendant's legal department's\n\nbelief that a jury might give it great weight did not destroy\n\nthe  reasonableness of the claim department's opinion that it\n\nmight not.   Two  different views could  both be  reasonable.\n\nApprehensions  did  not  make the  lower  offer unreasonable,\n\nparticularly where, in dollars, that offer was the nearer  to\n\nthe arbitrator's finding.\n\n                    \n\n2.  In saying this we may look at the arbitrator's finding of\n$55,000.  Plaintiffs'  complaint of  the magistrate's  giving\nweight  hereto  overlooks that the statute  expressly permits\nit.  Mass.  G.L. c. 176D,   3(9)(8)G.   Their contention that\nhe accepted it out of hand is incorrect.\n\n                             -6-\n\n          We  accept   the  magistrate's   recommendation  in\n\nsubstance, and affirm the district court.\n\n                             -7-\n</pre>",
