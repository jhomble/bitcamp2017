O'NEIL,\n\n                       Plaintiffs, Appellants,\n\n                                     v.\n\n              ELECTROLUX HOME PRODUCTS, INC., ET AL.,\n\n                       Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n           Howard, Selya and Thompson, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n          Roy A. Bourgeois, with whom Bourgeois, Dresser, White &\nMcGourthy, LLP was on brief, for appellants.\n          James M. Brogan, with whom Peter M. Durney, Gregg P.\nBailey, Cornell & Gollub, Nancy Shane Rappaport, and DLA Piper US,\nLLP were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n                              June 15, 2011\n\f          Per Curiam.    This is a wrongful death action that arises\n\nout of the tragic death of a young boy in a power-mower accident.\n\nThe boy's parents sued those responsible for the manufacture,\n\ndesign, and marketing of the riding mower.\n\n          The parties tried the case to a jury, primarily on a\n\ndesign-defect theory. During its deliberations, the jury submitted\n\nserial questions to the district court. The court responded to the\n\nfirst question without incident. The dispute here involves the\n\nhandling of the second question.\n\n          After   the   court   consulted   with   counsel,   it   gave   a\n\nsupplemental instruction in reply to that question.           The jurors\n\nresumed deliberations briefly and then returned a take-nothing\n\nverdict in favor of the defendants.\n\n          The district court subsequently denied the plaintiffs'\n\nmotion for a new trial.     O'Neil v. Electrolux Home Prods., Inc.,\n\nNo. 1:06-cv-10433, 2010 WL 3504191 (D. Mass. Sept. 7, 2010).         This\n\ntimely appeal followed.\n\n          The lone issue on appeal concerns the propriety of the\n\ndistrict court's supplemental jury instruction. The district court\n\nrevisited this issue and confronted it head-on when denying the\n\nplaintiffs' motion for a new trial.\n\n          The applicable standard of appellate review is abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   See, e.g., Testa v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d\n\n173, 175-76 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Parent, 954 F.2d 23,\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f25 (1st Cir. 1992); see generally DeCaro v. Hasbro, Inc., 580 F.3d\n\n55, 61 (1st Cir. 2009).    In applying this standard, we are mindful\n\nthat a material error of law is a per se abuse of discretion.              See,\n\ne.g., R&G Mortg. Corp. v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., 584 F.3d 1,\n\n7 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n            The   supplemental   instruction      mirrored    the    district\n\ncourt's original instruction on the point (to which the plaintiffs\n\nhad   not   objected).    It   also    tracked   the   requests     to   charge\n\nsubmitted by the plaintiffs prior to trial.            The district court's\n\nrescript persuasively explains why, in the circumstances of this\n\ncase, this supplemental instruction was neither inappropriate nor\n\nprejudicial.      See O'Neil, 2010 WL 3504191, at *3-4.              There is\n\nlittle that we can add to this thoughtful explanation.\n\n            In the past, we frequently have acknowledged that when a\n\ntrial court addresses an issue squarely, faithfully applies the law\n\nto the facts, articulates a convincing rationale for its decision,\n\nand reaches a correct result, it would be folly for us to wax\n\nlongiloquent for no purpose other than to hear our own words\n\nresonate.    See, e.g., Eaton v. Penn-Am. Ins. Co., 626 F.3d 113, 114\n\n(1st Cir. 2010); Seaco Ins. Co. v. Davis-Irish, 300 F.3d 84, 86\n\n(1st Cir. 2002); Chico-Vélez v. Roche Prods., Inc., 139 F.3d 56, 58\n\n(1st Cir. 1998); Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas de P.R., 74 F.3d\n\n344, 345 (1st Cir. 1996); In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire\n\nLitig., 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).          This is such a case.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f            We need go no further.   We reject the plaintiffs' appeal\n\nfor substantially the reasons set forth in the district court's\n\ncogently reasoned rescript and affirm the judgment below.     See 1st\n\nCir. R. 27.0.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\f",
