Lopez Romo, United States  Attorney, Jose Vazquez\n                                                               \nGarcia,  Assistant United  States Attorney,  and Joseph  E.

We  conclude  that   the  ALJ  erred  in\n                \n\ndetermining   that  claimant  had   the  residual  functional\n\ncapacity (RFC) to  perform the full range  of sedentary work.\n                                   \n\nWe explain briefly.\n\n     Claimant  fractured his right ulna in 1986.  As a result\n\nof  this fracture, the ALJ found,  claimant's arm movement is\n\nrestricted; he cannot pronate  (rotate downwards) or supinate\n\n(rotate  upwards)  the   right  lower  forearm,  lifting   is\n\nrestricted to  ten pounds,  and claimant cannot  perform past\n\njanitorial  work.    Despite  the  pronation  and  supination\n\nrestrictions, however,  the  ALJ  applied  Grid  rule  201.23\n\n(younger  individual,  illiterate,  previous  unskilled  work\n\nexperience, RFC for sedentary work), which directed a finding\n\nof not disabled, to  conclude that jobs exist in  the economy\n\ncommensurate with claimant's RFC.\n\n     As we  have explained,  the Secretary can  not discharge\n\nher burden at step five of the  sequential evaluation process\n\nby  relying  on  the  Grid when  a  nonexertional  impairment\n\nsignificantly affects a claimant's vocational functioning:\n\n          [T]he   Grid   is   \"predicated   on   an\n          individual's  having an  impairment which\n          manifests   itself   by  limitations   in\n          meeting  the   strength  requirements  of\n                                 \n          jobs....\"  20  C.F.R. Part. 404,  Subpart\n          P, App.  2,   200.00(e)  (1988) (emphasis\n          added).    Accordingly, where  a claimant\n          has one or more non-strength limitations,\n          \"the Guidelines do not accurately reflect\n          what  jobs   would   or  would   not   be\n          available.\" Gagnon v. Secretary of Health\n                                                   \n          and Human Services, 666 F.3d 662, 665 n.6\n                            \n\n                             -2-\n\n          (1st  Cir.  1981).    In  cases  where  a\n          nonexertional  impairment  \"significantly\n          affects claimant's ability to perform the\n          full  range  of  jobs\"  he  is  otherwise\n          exertionally capable of performing, Lugo,\n                                                  \n          794 F.2d at 17, \"the Secretary must carry\n          his burden of proving the availability of\n          jobs  in the  national  economy by  other\n          means,\"  Gagnon,  666  F.2d  at  666 n.6,\n                         \n          typically through the use of a vocational\n          expert.   On  the  other  hand, should  a\n          nonexertional  limitation   be  found  to\n          impose no significant restriction  on the\n          range of work  a claimant is exertionally\n          able to  perform,  reliance on  the  Grid\n          remains appropriate.\n\nOrtiz v.  Secretary of  Health and  Human Services,  890 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n520,  524 (1st Cir. 1989).   Ortiz qualifies this restriction\n                                  \n\non  the Grid's use in  cases where a significant non-strength\n\nimpairment  exists but there  is a basis  for concluding that\n\nits  effect   is  only   to  reduce  the   occupational  base\n\n\"marginally,\" id., but there  is no evidence or  inference of\n                \n\nthat kind in this case. \n\n     There  was  evidence of  the  following.   Claimant  was\n\nexamined  in May 1989 by Dr.  Rodriguez at the request of the\n\ndisability determination program.   Dr. Rodriguez noted  that\n\nclaimant's  right forearm  was  held in  a position  \"with no\n\npronation, nor supination possible suggestive of a bony union\n\nbetween the radius  and ulna,\"  but he did  not explain  what\n\neffect this had on  claimant's functioning.  Two nonexamining\n\ndoctors,  however, did touch on the matter.  Both checked off\n\nthe \"limited\" boxes  on RFC forms on reaching,  handling, and\n\n                             -3-\n\nfingering.      One  wrote   that  these   restrictions  were\n\n\"moderate.\"  The other said they were \"moderate to severe.\"\n\n     The  Secretary's own  regulations  and rulings  indicate\n\nthat reaching, handling,  and fingering limitations  well may\n\nsignificantly  narrow the  occupational base.    Reaching and\n\nhandling, the Secretary has said, \"are activities required in\n\nalmost  all jobs.    Significant limitations  of reaching  or\n\nhandling . . .  may eliminate a large number of occupations a\n\nperson could otherwise do.\"  SSR 85-15.  Fingering \"is needed\n\nto  perform  most  unskilled  sedentary  jobs.\"    Id.    And\n                                                     \n\n\"bilateral  manual dexterity is necessary for the performance\n\nof substantially all unskilled  sedentary occupations.\"   SSR\n\n83-14; 20 CFR Pt. 404, Subpart P, App. 2,   201.00(h).\n\n     Here, where the only doctors  to address the matter have\n\nsaid  that  claimant's   reaching,  handling,  and  fingering\n\nlimitations are \"moderate\" or \"moderate to severe\" in degree,\n\nthe  ALJ may  not permissibly  ignore their  opinions, assert\n\nwithout explanation that claimant can perform a full range of\n                                                    \n\nsedentary   work,  and   apply  the   Grid   without  further\n\nexplanation.   Consequently, a  remand is needed  for further\n\nproceedings.  See Heggarty v.  Sullivan, 947 F.2d 990, 996-97\n                                       \n\n(1st   Cir.  1991)  (where  uncontradicted  medical  evidence\n\nindicated claimant's manual dexterity was limited,  the ALJ's\n\nconclusion that claimant retained the capacity to perform the\n\n                             -4-\n\nfull range of sedentary work was not supported by substantial\n\nevidence and a remand for vocational evidence was required).\n\n     There  is  evidence in  the record  of  the report  of a\n\nvocational  specialist who  did not testify,  indicating that\n\nthere were  at least  a few \"light  work\" jobs that  could be\n\nperformed   by  one   of  claimant's   age  and   educational\n\nqualifications.      Whether   the    vocational   specialist\n\nappreciated  claimant's  exertional  limitations  as  well is\n\nunclear.    Whether  the   light  work  jobs  specified  were\n\navailable  in the  national economy,  in accordance  with the\n\nstatutory test,  was not  stated.  42  U.S.C.    423(d)(2)(A)\n\n(jobs  claimant  is  capable  of performing  must  exist  \"in\n\nsignificant  numbers either  in the  region where  [claimant]\n\nlives or in several regions of  the country\").  In any event,\n\nthe  ALJ did not refer to vocational evidence at all, relying\n\ninstead solely upon  the Grid, and we cannot rehabilitate the\n\ndecision based on this evidence.   Cf. Securities &amp;  Exchange\n                                                             \n\nComm. v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 93-95 (1943).\n                      \n\n     Accordingly,   a  remand   is   required   for   further\n\nproceedings,  which may  well  require  the consideration  of\n\nexpert vocational  evidence.   We decline  claimant's request\n\nfor a determination that claimant is entitled to benefits  as\n\na  matter  of  law.   We  have  considered  claimant's  other\n\narguments,  including   his  challenge  to   the  ALJ's  pain\n\n                             -5-\n\nfindings, but find them without merit  for the reasons stated\n\nin the magistrate-judge's July 16, 1992 report.\n\n     The judgment  of the district  court is vacated  and the\n                                                    \n\ncase is  remanded with directions to remand  to the Secretary\n                 \n\nfor further proceedings.  \n\n                             -6-\n",
