This is an appeal\n          Higginbotham, Senior Circuit Judge.   \n                                            \n\nfrom  an order of summary  judgment in favor  of defendant, Moore\n\nBusiness Forms, Inc., and  against plaintiffs, Frank B. Abbadessa\n\nand  Robert D. Mariotti.   Abbadessa and Mariotti  sued Moore for\n\nwrongful  termination of  employment.   Moore  moved for  summary\n\njudgment,  arguing that  Abbadessa  and Mariotti  each agreed  in\n\nwriting  at the time of  their termination to  release Moore from\n\nany claims arising from  plaintiffs' employment or termination of\n\nemployment.  Plaintiffs opposed  the motion for summary judgment,\n\neach  alleging that the agreement to release their claims against\n\nMoore had been signed under economic duress.\n\n          The United  States district  court for the  District of\n\nNew  Hampshire,  applying  New  Hampshire  law,  granted  Moore's\n\nsummary judgment motion as  to both Abbadessa and Mariotti.   The\n\ncourt, in separate  orders, found, as a matter  of law, that even\n\nif Abbadessa and Mariotti  had signed their respective agreements\n\nunder duress,  each also subsequently ratified  the agreements by\n\nfailing to repudiate them promptly and  by accepting the benefits\n\nthat flowed under the agreements.\n\n          Because we  agree that Abbadessa  and Mariotti ratified\n\ntheir respective  resignation  agreements,  we  will  affirm  the\n\ndistrict court's orders of summary judgment in favor of Moore.  \n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nThis  is a  diversity action.   Both  Abbadessa and  Mariotti are\n\ncitizens  of New Hampshire.  Moore is a Delaware corporation with\n\nits  principal place of business in Illinois.  The district court\n\nhad subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1332.  We\n\nhave appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1291.\n\n                                I\n\nFrank B. Abbadessa\n                  \n\n          Frank B.  Abbadessa began working as  an accountant for\n\nMoore  Business Forms, Inc. in December 1973.  By 1988, Abbadessa\n\nhad advanced to the managerial position of Comptroller of Moore's\n\nLocust  Street plant  in Dover,  New Hampshire.   On  January 19,\n\n1988,  in a  meeting between Abbadessa,  R.J. Barth,  the General\n\nManager  of  the  Locust  Street plant,  and  Brian  Groves,  the\n\nDirector of Human Resources,  Moore requested Abbadessa to resign\n\nand  to  sign a  resignation  agreement.   Under  the resignation\n\nagreement,  Moore  would  provide Abbadessa  with  the  following\n\nbenefits   from January 19, until April 30 1988: (1) compensation\n\nin  the  amount  of $4,611.75  per  month;  (2)  payment for  any\n\nvacation owed Abbadessa for  1988; (3) continued participation in\n\nMoore's Healthcare  plan, Dental Plan, and  Group Insurance Plan,\n\nwith an option to  extend participation after April 30,  1988, if\n\nAbbadessa made quarterly  payments; and (4) payment  by Moore for\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\noutplacement counseling services  to assist Abbadessa  in finding\n\nother employment.  The agreement also provided that Abbadessa and\n\nMoore released  each other from  any other claims  or obligations\n\narising  from Abbadessa'  employment  with,  and termination  by,\n\nMoore.\n\n          Moore  informed Abbadessa  that he  was being  asked to\n\nresign  because  his  performance  had not  been  satisfactory.  \n\nFurther, Moore  made  clear to  Abbadessa  that he  could  either\n\nresign with  the benefits  provided under  the  agreement or  not\n\nresign  and  face  the possibility  of  being  fired without  any\n\nbenefits.    Abbadessa did  not  sign  the resignation  agreement\n\nduring the January 19  meeting.  He considered the  agreement for\n\ntwo  weeks  and,  in  early  February,  he  returned  it  signed,\n\nbackdated to January 20.  During the interval between the January\n\n19 meeting and  the time  in early  February when  he signed  the\n\nagreement,  Abbadessa sought  payment  of his  vacation pay  from\n\nMoore.    Moore  apparently  refused to  pay  any  benefits until\n\nAbbadessa  signed  the  resignation   agreement.    According  to\n\nAbbadessa, he finally  signed the agreement  because his lack  of\n\nfinancial resources left him no other choice. \n\n          On May 27, 1988,  Abbadessa requested that Moore extend\n\npayment of  the benefits provided under the  January 18 agreement\n\nwhich had expired  on April  30, 1988.   Abbadessa requested  the\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\nextension because he had  not been able to find  other employment\n\nand  had run out  of money.   Moore agreed to  extend benefits to\n\nAbbadessa for one more month and amended the January 18 agreement\n\nto  reflect that  Abbadessa would  receive the  benefits provided\n\nunder the  original agreement  through May  31, 1988.   Abbadessa\n\nsigned  the amended agreement and  dated it June  6, 1988. Toward\n\nthe  end of June 1988, Abbadessa again requested that Moore grant\n\nhim  a further  extension  of his  benefits.     Moore  agreed to\n\nprovide Abbadessa  with benefits covering half the month of June.\n\nFinally, in July Abbadessa made one more request for extension of\n\nhis benefits.  This time Moore refused. \n\nRobert D. Mariotti\n                  \n\n          Robert Mariotti  began working as a  salesman for Moore\n\nin  December 1970.    By  1988,  Mariotti  had  advanced  to  the\n\nmanagerial  position  of  Operations Manager  for  Moore's Locust\n\nStreet plant.  On  May 24, 1988, in  a meeting between  Mariotti,\n\nBarth  and Groves, Moore requested Mariotti to resign and to sign\n\na resignation agreement similar to the one presented to Abbadessa\n\non  January 18, 1988.  The agreement provided similar benefits as\n\nthose  paid to  Abbadessa  and covered  the period  of May  24 to\n\nAugust  31, 1988: (1) compensation in the amount of $5,296.60 per\n\nmonth; (2) payment for  any vacation owed Mariotti for  1988; (3)\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\ncontinued  participation in Moore's Healthcare Plan, Dental Plan,\n\nand  Group Insurance Plan, with an option to extend participation\n\nafter August 31,  1988, if Mariotti made  quarterly payments; and\n\n(4)  payment by  Moore  for outplacement  counseling services  to\n\nassist Mariotti in finding other  employment.  The agreement also\n\nprovided that  Moore and Mariotti  released each  other from  any\n\nother claims  or obligations arising  from Mariotti's  employment\n\nwith, or termination by, Moore.\n\n          As with Abbadessa, Moore  informed Mariotti that he was\n\nbeing  asked  to  resign because  his  performance  had not  been\n\nsatisfactory.   Mariotti was  also presented with  the choice  of\n\nresigning  with  benefits  or  facing the  possibility  of  being\n\nterminated without benefits.   After thinking about the agreement\n\nfor  two days,  Mariotti  returned it  signed  on May  26,  1988.\n\nMariotti  claimed that  he signed  the agreement  under financial\n\npressure  and that,  being aware  of Abbadessa's  experience with\n\nMoore, he understood that  he would receive no benefits  until he\n\nsigned the agreement.\n\nProcedural Background\n                     \n\n          On September 21, 1988,  Abbadessa and Mariotti wrote to\n\ncounsel for Moore  that \"they believed  they had been  terminated\n\nwithout  cause  in  violation  of the  established  policies  and\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\nprocedures  of  Moore and  that they  had  signed the  letters of\n\nresignation under  duress.\"   On  April  11, 1989  Abbadessa  and\n\nMariotti  brought  separate  actions  for  breach  of  employment\n\ncontract  against  Moore  in  New  Hampshire's  Strafford  County\n\nSuperior  Court.    Plaintiffs,  in  their  separate  complaints,\n\nalleged  that  Moore  issued  written  policies,  providing  that\n\nemployees  would not be terminated except for cause and then only\n\nafter being made aware of  deficiencies in their job  performance\n\nand  given  the  opportunity   to  correct  those   deficiencies.\n\nAccording to  plaintiffs, these  written policies  constituted an\n\nenforceable employment  contract under  New Hampshire  law, which\n\nMoore breached  by terminating plaintiffs without  just cause and\n\nwithout giving  plaintiffs the opportunity to  correct what Moore\n\ndeemed to be deficiencies in their job performance.\n\n          On May 5, 1989, both actions were removed to the United\n\nStates district  court  for  the District  of  New  Hampshire  on\n\nMoore's  petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C.    1441.  On September 9,\n\n1989, Moore moved for summary  judgment as to the claims of  both\n\nAbbadessa and Mariotti.   Moore  argued that  the written  policy\n\nupon  which  Abbadessa and  Mariotti  relied,  which stated  that\n\nemployees  would not  be terminated  except for  cause, had  been\n\nreplaced by  a subsequent policy issued  during plaintiffs' terms\n\nof employment.   The new  policy did not  provide that  employees\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nwould  not  be  terminated except  for  cause.    As such,  Moore\n\nmaintained,  there  existed  no  enforceable  employment contract\n\nbetween plaintiffs and Moore.  In any event, Moore continued, the\n\nresignation agreements signed by  Abbadessa and Mariotti released\n\nMoore  from  any  and  all  liability  arising  from  plaintiffs'\n\nemployment with, or termination by, Moore.  \n\n          Abbadessa and Mariotti opposed the motions for  summary\n\njudgment.  They  argued that  they never received  notice of  the\n\nchange of policy.  They also  argued that they never received any\n\nconsideration for the new policy, and that New Hampshire law does\n\nnot  permit  an employer  to  unilaterally  modify conditions  of\n\nemployment to the detriment of an  employee in the absence of new\n\nconsideration to the employee.  As to Moore's claim that they had\n\nreleased any  right to  sue, Abbadessa  and Mariotti  argued that\n\ntheir respective resignation agreements were invalid because they\n\nhad signed the agreements under economic duress.\n\n          On October 25, 1989,  the district court denied Moore's\n\nmotion for summary judgment as to Mariotti.  On November 7, 1989,\n\nthe  court  denied  Moore's motion  for  summary  judgment as  to\n\nAbbadessa.   The court employed  the same reasoning  to deny both\n\nmotions.   According to  the court,  Moore's motions  for summary\n\njudgment  presented  three issues:  (1)  whether Moore's  initial\n\npersonnel policy  represented an enforceable contract;  (2) if it\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\nwas  an  enforceable  contract, whether  it  was  amended by  the\n\nsubsequent policy; and (3)  whether Abbadessa and Mariotti signed\n\ntheir respective resignation agreements under duress.  In denying\n\nMoore's  motions, the  court concluded  that all  three questions\n\ninvolved genuine issues of  material fact which would have  to be\n\ndecided at trial.1\n\n          On  August  20,  1991,  Moore renewed  its  motion  for\n\nsummary  judgment as to Abbadessa, and the next day, on August 21\n\n1991,  Moore renewed  its  motion  for  summary  judgment  as  to\n\nMariotti.  This  time, Moore  argued that even  if Abbadessa  and\n\nMariotti had  signed their  resignation agreements  under duress,\n\nthey  had  subsequently ratified  the  agreements  by failing  to\n\nrepudiate  promptly and  by  accepting all  benefits that  flowed\n\nunder  the  agreements.    Abbadessa and  Mariotti,  in  a  joint\n\nmemorandum, raised  three grounds  to defeat Moore's  motions for\n\nsummary judgment.   First, plaintiffs argued that the doctrine of\n\nthe  \"law  of  the  case\"  precluded  the   district  court  from\n\nconsidering Moore's  renewed motions.  Second,  plaintiffs argued\n\nthat   Moore  had   not  pleaded   the  affirmative   defense  of\n\n                       \n\n   1The case  of Robert  Mariotti v.  Moore Business  Forms was\n                                                           \n   originally  assigned to  Judge Loughlin,  while the  case of\n   Abbadessa  v. Moore  Business  Forms was  assigned to  Judge\n                                       \n   Devine.  Subsequent to  the denial of Moore's first  motions\n   for summary  judgement, both cases were  reassigned to Judge\n   Stahl's calendar.\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\nratification in its answer or in its original motions for summary\n\njudgment and that, pursuant to Rule 8(c) of the Federal  Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure, an  affirmative defense which is  not pleaded is\n\nwaived.   Finally, plaintiffs maintained that  there were genuine\n\nissues  of material  fact  as to  whether  they were  capable  of\n\nratifying the resignation agreements.  \n\n          On  January 9, 1992, in  two separate orders, the court\n\ngranted Moore's motion for summary  judgment as to Abbadessa  and\n\nMariotti.  The court  rejected plaintiffs' \"law of the  case\" and\n\n\"waiver   of  unpleaded   affirmative  defense\"   arguments,  and\n\nconcluded that,  under New  Hampshire law, plaintiffs  had indeed\n\nratified their respective  resignation agreements and that  Moore\n\nwas entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n\n          Abbadessa and  Mariotti now appeal, raising  two of the\n\ngrounds  that  were before  the  district  court.   Specifically,\n\nplaintiffs maintain that the \"law of the case\" doctrine precluded\n\nthe district  court  from ruling  on Moore's  renewed motion  for\n\nsummary judgment,  and that there were genuine issues of material\n\nfact  as  to whether  plaintiffs  were capable  of  ratifying the\n\nresignation agreements. \n\n                                II\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\n          Our review  of the district court's  orders for summary\n\njudgment  is  plenary.   United  States  v.  One  Parcel of  Real\n                                                                 \n\nProperty with Bldgs,  960 F.2d 200, 204 (1st Cir.  1992).  A Rule\n                   \n\n56 motion for summary  judgment will only be granted if  there is\n\nno genuine  issue as to any material fact and the moving party is\n\nentitled  to  judgment  as a  matter  of  law.  Celotex Corp.  v.\n                                                                 \n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).  \n       \n\n          In a diversity action the substantive law  of the forum\n\nstate determines  which facts  are material. Anderson  v. Liberty\n                                                                 \n\nLobby,  Inc.,  477 U.S.  242, 248  (1986).   Here,  New Hampshire\n            \n\nsubstantive  law  will  determine if  plaintiffs  raised  genuine\n\nissues  of  material  fact  as to  whether  they  ratified  their\n\nrespective  resignation agreements.   But first,  we turn  to the\n\nquestion  of  whether  the doctrine  of  the  \"law  of the  case\"\n\nprecluded  the  district court  from  ruling  on Moore's  renewed\n\nmotion for summary judgment. \n\n                                A.\n\n          Under the doctrine of the \"law of the case\", a decision\n\non  an issue of  law made  by the  court at one  stage of  a case\n\nbecomes a binding  precedent to be followed  in successive stages\n\nof the same  litigation except in  unusual circumstances.

Moore, Federal  Practice  0.404[1]\n\n(1980).  \n\n          Here, the  district court,  in denying  Moore's initial\n\nmotions  for summary  judgment, decided  that there  were genuine\n\nissues of material fact as to whether Abbadessa and Mariotti were\n\nunder   such  economic  duress  at   the  time  they  signed  the\n\nresignation agreements as to render the agreements  voidable.  In\n\nits renewed motions for summary judgment, Moore argued that, even\n\nif  Abbadessa and Moore signed  the agreements under  the sort of\n\neconomic  duress  which  would render  the  agreements  voidable,\n\nAbbadessa and Mariotti had nonetheless ratified the agreements by\n\ntheir  subsequent conduct.   The issue  of whether  Abbadessa and\n\nMariotti ratified the agreements is  one which the district court\n\ndid  not consider, much less decide, in ruling on Moore's initial\n\nmotions for summary judgment.   \n\n          We have stated in this circuit that the doctrine of the\n\n\"law  of  the  case\" \"merely  expresses  the  practice  of courts\n\ngenerally to refuse to  open what has been decided.\"  Piazza, 909\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at  38.   The issue  raised in  Moore's renewed  motions for\n\nsummary  judgment  was  never  decided  by  the  district  court.\n\nAccordingly,  the   district  court   was   not  precluded   from\n\n                               -13-\n                                13\n\nconsidering  whether  Abbadessa   and  Mariotti  ratified   their\n\nrespective resignation agreements.\n\n                                B.\n\n          In  New  Hampshire,  contracts  signed  under  economic\n\nduress are voidable.

In\n                         \n\nthe words of the Supreme Court  of New Hampshire: \"the payment of\n\nmoney  or  the  making   of  a  contract  might  be   under  such\n\ncircumstances of business necessity  or compulsion as will render\n\nthe  same involuntary and entitle the party so coerced to recover\n\nthe  money  paid or  excuse  him from  performing  the contract.\"\n\nCheshire Oil Co., 385 A.2d at 838.\n                \n\n          In order to be  \"excused\" from performing the contract,\n\na  party relying on a  theory of business  compulsion or economic\n\nduress must demonstrate four elements.  First,  the party relying\n\non economic  duress must have involuntarily accepted the terms of\n\nanother.   \"It must appear  that consent was  actually induced by\n\nthe  pressure applied and  would not have  been given otherwise.\"\n\nId. at  839, quoting Morrill  v. Bank, 90  N.H. 358, 365,  9 A.2d\n                                     \n\n519,  525 (1939).   Second, \"the coercive circumstances must have\n\nbeen the result of the acts of the opposite party.\"  Cheshire Oil\n                                                                 \n\n                               -14-\n                                14\n\nCo.,  385 A.2d  at  839.   Third, \"the  pressure  must have  been\n   \n\nwrongful.\"  Id.   An  act or  threat of  an  act may  be wrongful\n               \n\n\"although the  act or  threat is not  criminal or tortious  or in\n\nviolation  of a  contractual duty.\"  Id.   Fourth, \"circumstances\n                                        \n\nmust  have permitted no other alternative but to accept the terms\n\nof  another if there is to be  a finding of business compulsion.\"\n\nId.  Thus, if the party relying on the theory  of economic duress\n   \n\n\"had a legal  remedy adequate  to redress or  compensate for  the\n\ninjury threatened, the threat will not amount to duress.\"  Id.\n                                                              \n\n          Given the  above definition  of economic  duress, there\n\nare, as  the district  court found, disputed  issues of  material\n\nfact  as  to  whether  Abbadessa and  Moore  satisfied  the  four\n\nelements  of duress.  Specifically,  looking at the  facts in the\n\nlight most  favorable to plaintiffs,  it is disputed  whether the\n\n\"coercive   circumstances\"  surrounding   the   signing  of   the\n\nresignation  agreements  were  \"the  result of  acts  of\"  Moore.\n\nAbbadessa  and  Mariotti  claim   that  Moore  created  \"coercive\n\ncircumstances\" by refusing to  negotiate any of the terms  of the\n\nagreements and by  withholding benefits plaintiffs were  entitled\n\nto  until  they signed  the agreement.    It is  further disputed\n\nwhether  the choice given by  Moore to Abbadessa  and Mariotti of\n\nresigning with benefits or  not resigning and risking termination\n\nwithout benefits  was \"wrongful.\"   Abbadessa and  Mariotti claim\n\n                               -15-\n                                15\n\nthat Moore's bargaining position was wrongful because it was done\n\nin  bad faith.    It  is finally  disputed whether  Abbadessa and\n\nMariotti  were left with \"no other alternatives but to accept the\n\nterms\" proposed by Moore.  Abbadessa and Mariotti claim that they\n\nwere not fully aware of  any internal appeal procedures available\n\nto them at  the time  they were presented  with the requests  for\n\nthem  to resign.  They also claim  that they were in no financial\n\nor mental shape to begin court actions.\n\n          Therefore,  assuming for  purposes of  summary judgment\n\nthat Abbadessa  and Mariotti signed the  agreements under duress,\n\nthe question now becomes whether Moore is nonetheless entitled to\n\njudgment  as  a matter  of  law  because Abbadessa  and  Mariotti\n\nratified the agreements by their subsequent actions.\n\n          In  New Hampshire,  voidable  contracts are  subject to\n\nratification. Sawtelle v. Tatone, 105 N.H. 398, 201 A.2d 111, 115\n                                \n\n(1964).    Since a  contract  executed under  economic  duress is\n\nvoidable it is also  subject to ratification.  New  Hampshire has\n\nnever  specifically identified  the circumstances  under which  a\n\ncontract  executed under  economic duress  will be  considered to\n\nhave been ratified.   But generally, a voidable contract  will be\n\ndeemed to  have been ratified  when the party who  is entitled to\n\navoid  the contract \"does any act which amounts to a ratification\n\nafter full  knowledge of  all the  facts and  circumstances.\" Id.\n                                                                 \n\n                               -16-\n                                16\n\nActs amounting to ratification  are payment or acceptance  of the\n\nbenefits  of the contract  and failure to  repudiate the contract\n\npromptly.  Id. 2     As the  Supreme Court  of New  Hampshire has\n              \n\nstated:  \"A  party cannot treat  the contract  as binding and  as\n\nrescinded at  the same time, and after he has elected to stand by\n\nthe contract and receive  the benefits it confers on him, and has\n\nthus ratified  and  confirmed  it, he  cannot  thus  rescind  and\n\nrepudiate it.\" Bechard v. Amey, 82 N.H. 462, 471, 136 A. 370, 375\n                              \n\n(1926).\n\n          Here, both Abbadessa and Mariotti sought to treat their\n\nresignation  agreements as  \"binding  and rescinded  at the  same\n\ntime.\"   Both accepted the  benefits the agreements  conferred on\n\nthem and neither attempted  to repudiate the agreements promptly.\n\n                       \n\n   2See also Hillside Assoc. of Hollis, Inc. v.

After  his  benefits under  the January  19 agreement  had\n\nexpired, Abbadessa  requested that  Moore extend him  benefits on\n\nthree separate occasions.  Moore acceded to two of these requests\n\nand refused  to extend  added benefits  on Abbadessa's  third and\n\nfinal  request.    So,  from  February  1988  until  April  1988,\n\nAbbadessa  treated  the agreement  as  binding  by accepting  the\n\nbenefits  Moore had promised.   Moreover,  from April  1988 until\n\nJune 1988,  Abbadessa further ratified the  original agreement by\n\nmaking three  separate requests that Moore  extend benefits which\n\nwere not  owed under the agreement.  It was not until after Moore\n\nhad  refused  additional extensions  of  benefits  that Abbadessa\n\nnotified  Moore's  counsel by  letter in  July  1988 that  he had\n\nsigned the agreement under duress.  Finally, even after Abbadessa\n\nhad filed his  suit against Moore, at no point  did he attempt to\n\nreturn to Moore the benefits of the agreement which he now claims\n\nhe signed under duress.\n\n          Similarly,  Mariotti considered  his agreement  for two\n\ndays  before  signing  it.   From  May  1988  until August  1988,\n\nMariotti continued  to receive the benefits  under the agreement.\n\nEven after  Mariotti supposedly  wrote to  Moore Counsel  in July\n\n1988  that he  had  signed the  agreement  under the  duress,  he\n\ncontinued to received the benefits under the agreement for August\n\n                               -18-\n                                18\n\n1988.   As with Abbadessa,  even after having  filed suit against\n\nMoore, at no  point did Mariotti  attempt to return to  Moore the\n\nbenefits of the  agreement which  he now claims  he signed  under\n\nduress.\n\n          The Supreme Court of New  Hampshire has written that \"a\n\nperson seeking to rescind cannot treat the contract  as rescinded\n\nand binding at  the same time.\"  Sawtelle, 201 A.2d  at 115.   By\n                                         \n\naccepting the benefits of their respective resignation agreements\n\nand by failing  to notify  Moore promptly that  they intended  to\n\nrepudiate  the agreements,  Abbadessa  and  Mariotti treated  the\n\nagreements as  binding.  After having  done so, they  now wish to\n\ntreat the  agreements as  rescinded.   That, under  New Hampshire\n\nlaw, they may not do.\n\n          Abbadessa and  Mariotti argue that they  could not have\n\npossibly  ratified  the agreements  until  after  the duress  was\n\nremoved.  Since, according to Abbadessa and Mariotti, they signed\n\nthe agreements under duress because basically, by  asking them to\n\nresign, Moore caused them to  be in desperate need for money,  we\n\nunderstand plaintiffs'  argument to  mean that duress  would have\n\nbeen  removed when  they were  no longer  in such  dire financial\n\nstraits.  But, as we stated  at the outset of our discussion, the\n\nissue in this case is whether appellants raised genuine issues of\n\nmaterial  fact  as  to  whether they  ratified  their  respective\n\n                               -19-\n                                19\n\nagreements.   Stated  another  way: whether  they raised  genuine\n\nissues  of material  fact that  the claimed  duress had  not been\n\nremoved  between the time they signed the agreements and the time\n\nthey  brought this action.   Appellants have failed  to raise any\n\nfacts  to that effect.  While Moore has advanced undisputed facts\n\nthat  appellants  accepted  the  benefits  of   their  respective\n\nagreements,  Abbadessa   and  Mariotti  have   offered  no  facts\n\n(disputed  or  undisputed) about  how  long  the economic  duress\n\nlasted;  or put  another way,  if and  when their  claimed duress\n\nceased.3  Having  failed to satisfy  their burden of  production,\n\n                       \n\n   3We  should also point out  that we have  found no authority\n   that New  Hampshire has  adopted or  would adopt  the theory\n   that a contract signed under  economic duress is capable  of\n   being  ratified only after the duress is removed.   The only\n   case from  this circuit addressing  the issue is  Ismert and\n                                                               \n   Associates, Inc.  v. New England Mutual  Life Insurance Co.,\n                                                              \n   801 F.2d  536 (1st Cir. 1986).   In that case,  this circuit\n   considered  an action  brought by  a tax  consulting service\n   firm against an insurance company.  The firm argued that the\n   agreement  it had  signed, releasing  the  insurance company\n   from any claims  resulting from the firm's  loss of business\n   opportunities, was  unenforceable  because it  was  obtained\n   under duress.  Judge Maletz authored the majority opinion as\n   well as a dissent.  In  his dissent on the issue of economic\n   duress, Judge Maletz wrote that  \"there can be no affirmance\n   [of a contract]  unless the  duress has  ended.\" Ismert  and\n                                                               \n   Associates, 801 F.2d at 548.  Judge  Breyer, writing for the\n             \n   majority  on the  question of  duress,  did not  address the\n   issue  of  whether a  contract  signed under  duress  is not\n   capable  of  being  ratified  until the  duress  has  ended.\n   Instead,  Judge Breyer found  that plaintiff had  not made a\n   sufficient  showing  that it  signed  the release  agreement\n   under  duress. Id..   In  Ismert, this circuit  was applying\n                                   \n   Massachusetts law.  Thus, the decision is not controlling in\n   this  case  involving  New  Hampshire law.    Moreover,  the\n\n                               -20-\n                                20\n\ntheir argument necessarily fails.  See,  e.g., Mesnick v. General\n                                                                 \n\nElec.

This is an appeal\n          Higginbotham, Senior Circuit Judge.   \n                                            \n\nfrom  an order of summary  judgment in favor  of defendant, Moore\n\nBusiness Forms, Inc., and  against plaintiffs, Frank B. Abbadessa\n\nand  Robert D. Mariotti.   Abbadessa and Mariotti  sued Moore for\n\nwrongful  termination of  employment.   Moore  moved for  summary\n\njudgment,  arguing that  Abbadessa  and Mariotti  each agreed  in\n\nwriting  at the time of  their termination to  release Moore from\n\nany claims arising from  plaintiffs' employment or termination of\n\nemployment.  Plaintiffs opposed  the motion for summary judgment,\n\neach  alleging that the agreement to release their claims against\n\nMoore had been signed under economic duress.\n\n          The United  States district  court for the  District of\n\nNew  Hampshire,  applying  New  Hampshire  law,  granted  Moore's\n\nsummary judgment motion as  to both Abbadessa and Mariotti.   The\n\ncourt, in separate  orders, found, as a matter  of law, that even\n\nif Abbadessa and Mariotti  had signed their respective agreements\n\nunder duress,  each also subsequently ratified  the agreements by\n\nfailing to repudiate them promptly and  by accepting the benefits\n\nthat flowed under the agreements.\n\n          Because we  agree that Abbadessa  and Mariotti ratified\n\ntheir respective  resignation  agreements,  we  will  affirm  the\n\ndistrict court's orders of summary judgment in favor of Moore.  \n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nThis  is a  diversity action.   Both  Abbadessa and  Mariotti are\n\ncitizens  of New Hampshire.  Moore is a Delaware corporation with\n\nits  principal place of business in Illinois.  The district court\n\nhad subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1332.  We\n\nhave appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1291.\n\n                                I\n\nFrank B. Abbadessa\n                  \n\n          Frank B.  Abbadessa began working as  an accountant for\n\nMoore  Business Forms, Inc. in December 1973.  By 1988, Abbadessa\n\nhad advanced to the managerial position of Comptroller of Moore's\n\nLocust  Street plant  in Dover,  New Hampshire.   On  January 19,\n\n1988,  in a  meeting between Abbadessa,  R.J. Barth,  the General\n\nManager  of  the  Locust  Street plant,  and  Brian  Groves,  the\n\nDirector of Human Resources,  Moore requested Abbadessa to resign\n\nand  to  sign a  resignation  agreement.   Under  the resignation\n\nagreement,  Moore  would  provide Abbadessa  with  the  following\n\nbenefits   from January 19, until April 30 1988: (1) compensation\n\nin  the  amount  of $4,611.75  per  month;  (2)  payment for  any\n\nvacation owed Abbadessa for  1988; (3) continued participation in\n\nMoore's Healthcare  plan, Dental Plan, and  Group Insurance Plan,\n\nwith an option to  extend participation after April 30,  1988, if\n\nAbbadessa made quarterly  payments; and (4) payment  by Moore for\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\noutplacement counseling services  to assist Abbadessa  in finding\n\nother employment.  The agreement also provided that Abbadessa and\n\nMoore released  each other from  any other claims  or obligations\n\narising  from Abbadessa'  employment  with,  and termination  by,\n\nMoore.\n\n          Moore  informed Abbadessa  that he  was being  asked to\n\nresign  because  his  performance  had not  been  satisfactory.  \n\nFurther, Moore  made  clear to  Abbadessa  that he  could  either\n\nresign with  the benefits  provided under  the  agreement or  not\n\nresign  and  face  the possibility  of  being  fired without  any\n\nbenefits.    Abbadessa did  not  sign  the resignation  agreement\n\nduring the January 19  meeting.  He considered the  agreement for\n\ntwo  weeks  and,  in  early  February,  he  returned  it  signed,\n\nbackdated to January 20.  During the interval between the January\n\n19 meeting and  the time  in early  February when  he signed  the\n\nagreement,  Abbadessa sought  payment  of his  vacation pay  from\n\nMoore.    Moore  apparently  refused to  pay  any  benefits until\n\nAbbadessa  signed  the  resignation   agreement.    According  to\n\nAbbadessa, he finally  signed the agreement  because his lack  of\n\nfinancial resources left him no other choice. \n\n          On May 27, 1988,  Abbadessa requested that Moore extend\n\npayment of  the benefits provided under the  January 18 agreement\n\nwhich had expired  on April  30, 1988.   Abbadessa requested  the\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\nextension because he had  not been able to find  other employment\n\nand  had run out  of money.   Moore agreed to  extend benefits to\n\nAbbadessa for one more month and amended the January 18 agreement\n\nto  reflect that  Abbadessa would  receive the  benefits provided\n\nunder the  original agreement  through May  31, 1988.   Abbadessa\n\nsigned  the amended agreement and  dated it June  6, 1988. Toward\n\nthe  end of June 1988, Abbadessa again requested that Moore grant\n\nhim  a further  extension  of his  benefits.     Moore  agreed to\n\nprovide Abbadessa  with benefits covering half the month of June.\n\nFinally, in July Abbadessa made one more request for extension of\n\nhis benefits.  This time Moore refused. \n\nRobert D. Mariotti\n                  \n\n          Robert Mariotti  began working as a  salesman for Moore\n\nin  December 1970.    By  1988,  Mariotti  had  advanced  to  the\n\nmanagerial  position  of  Operations Manager  for  Moore's Locust\n\nStreet plant.  On  May 24, 1988, in  a meeting between  Mariotti,\n\nBarth  and Groves, Moore requested Mariotti to resign and to sign\n\na resignation agreement similar to the one presented to Abbadessa\n\non  January 18, 1988.  The agreement provided similar benefits as\n\nthose  paid to  Abbadessa  and covered  the period  of May  24 to\n\nAugust  31, 1988: (1) compensation in the amount of $5,296.60 per\n\nmonth; (2) payment for  any vacation owed Mariotti for  1988; (3)\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\ncontinued  participation in Moore's Healthcare Plan, Dental Plan,\n\nand  Group Insurance Plan, with an option to extend participation\n\nafter August 31,  1988, if Mariotti made  quarterly payments; and\n\n(4)  payment by  Moore  for outplacement  counseling services  to\n\nassist Mariotti in finding other  employment.  The agreement also\n\nprovided that  Moore and Mariotti  released each  other from  any\n\nother claims  or obligations arising  from Mariotti's  employment\n\nwith, or termination by, Moore.\n\n          As with Abbadessa, Moore  informed Mariotti that he was\n\nbeing  asked  to  resign because  his  performance  had not  been\n\nsatisfactory.   Mariotti was  also presented with  the choice  of\n\nresigning  with  benefits  or  facing the  possibility  of  being\n\nterminated without benefits.   After thinking about the agreement\n\nfor  two days,  Mariotti  returned it  signed  on May  26,  1988.\n\nMariotti  claimed that  he signed  the agreement  under financial\n\npressure  and that,  being aware  of Abbadessa's  experience with\n\nMoore, he understood that  he would receive no benefits  until he\n\nsigned the agreement.\n\nProcedural Background\n                     \n\n          On September 21, 1988,  Abbadessa and Mariotti wrote to\n\ncounsel for Moore  that \"they believed  they had been  terminated\n\nwithout  cause  in  violation  of the  established  policies  and\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\nprocedures  of  Moore and  that they  had  signed the  letters of\n\nresignation under  duress.\"   On  April  11, 1989  Abbadessa  and\n\nMariotti  brought  separate  actions  for  breach  of  employment\n\ncontract  against  Moore  in  New  Hampshire's  Strafford  County\n\nSuperior  Court.    Plaintiffs,  in  their  separate  complaints,\n\nalleged  that  Moore  issued  written  policies,  providing  that\n\nemployees  would not be terminated except for cause and then only\n\nafter being made aware of  deficiencies in their job  performance\n\nand  given  the  opportunity   to  correct  those   deficiencies.\n\nAccording to  plaintiffs, these  written policies  constituted an\n\nenforceable employment  contract under  New Hampshire  law, which\n\nMoore breached  by terminating plaintiffs without  just cause and\n\nwithout giving  plaintiffs the opportunity to  correct what Moore\n\ndeemed to be deficiencies in their job performance.\n\n          On May 5, 1989, both actions were removed to the United\n\nStates district  court  for  the District  of  New  Hampshire  on\n\nMoore's  petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C.    1441.  On September 9,\n\n1989, Moore moved for summary  judgment as to the claims of  both\n\nAbbadessa and Mariotti.   Moore  argued that  the written  policy\n\nupon  which  Abbadessa and  Mariotti  relied,  which stated  that\n\nemployees  would not  be terminated  except for  cause, had  been\n\nreplaced by  a subsequent policy issued  during plaintiffs' terms\n\nof employment.   The new  policy did not  provide that  employees\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nwould  not  be  terminated except  for  cause.    As such,  Moore\n\nmaintained,  there  existed  no  enforceable  employment contract\n\nbetween plaintiffs and Moore.  In any event, Moore continued, the\n\nresignation agreements signed by  Abbadessa and Mariotti released\n\nMoore  from  any  and  all  liability  arising  from  plaintiffs'\n\nemployment with, or termination by, Moore.  \n\n          Abbadessa and Mariotti opposed the motions for  summary\n\njudgment.  They  argued that  they never received  notice of  the\n\nchange of policy.  They also  argued that they never received any\n\nconsideration for the new policy, and that New Hampshire law does\n\nnot  permit  an employer  to  unilaterally  modify conditions  of\n\nemployment to the detriment of an  employee in the absence of new\n\nconsideration to the employee.  As to Moore's claim that they had\n\nreleased any  right to  sue, Abbadessa  and Mariotti  argued that\n\ntheir respective resignation agreements were invalid because they\n\nhad signed the agreements under economic duress.\n\n          On October 25, 1989,  the district court denied Moore's\n\nmotion for summary judgment as to Mariotti.  On November 7, 1989,\n\nthe  court  denied  Moore's motion  for  summary  judgment as  to\n\nAbbadessa.   The court employed  the same reasoning  to deny both\n\nmotions.   According to  the court,  Moore's motions  for summary\n\njudgment  presented  three issues:  (1)  whether Moore's  initial\n\npersonnel policy  represented an enforceable contract;  (2) if it\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\nwas  an  enforceable  contract, whether  it  was  amended by  the\n\nsubsequent policy; and (3)  whether Abbadessa and Mariotti signed\n\ntheir respective resignation agreements under duress.  In denying\n\nMoore's  motions, the  court concluded  that all  three questions\n\ninvolved genuine issues of  material fact which would have  to be\n\ndecided at trial.1\n\n          On  August  20,  1991,  Moore renewed  its  motion  for\n\nsummary  judgment as to Abbadessa, and the next day, on August 21\n\n1991,  Moore renewed  its  motion  for  summary  judgment  as  to\n\nMariotti.  This  time, Moore  argued that even  if Abbadessa  and\n\nMariotti had  signed their  resignation agreements  under duress,\n\nthey  had  subsequently ratified  the  agreements  by failing  to\n\nrepudiate  promptly and  by  accepting all  benefits that  flowed\n\nunder  the  agreements.    Abbadessa and  Mariotti,  in  a  joint\n\nmemorandum, raised  three grounds  to defeat Moore's  motions for\n\nsummary judgment.   First, plaintiffs argued that the doctrine of\n\nthe  \"law  of  the  case\"  precluded  the   district  court  from\n\nconsidering Moore's  renewed motions.  Second,  plaintiffs argued\n\nthat   Moore  had   not  pleaded   the  affirmative   defense  of\n\n                       \n\n   1The case  of Robert  Mariotti v.  Moore Business  Forms was\n                                                           \n   originally  assigned to  Judge Loughlin,  while the  case of\n   Abbadessa  v. Moore  Business  Forms was  assigned to  Judge\n                                       \n   Devine.  Subsequent to  the denial of Moore's first  motions\n   for summary  judgement, both cases were  reassigned to Judge\n   Stahl's calendar.\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\nratification in its answer or in its original motions for summary\n\njudgment and that, pursuant to Rule 8(c) of the Federal  Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure, an  affirmative defense which is  not pleaded is\n\nwaived.   Finally, plaintiffs maintained that  there were genuine\n\nissues  of material  fact  as to  whether  they were  capable  of\n\nratifying the resignation agreements.  \n\n          On  January 9, 1992, in  two separate orders, the court\n\ngranted Moore's motion for summary  judgment as to Abbadessa  and\n\nMariotti.  The court  rejected plaintiffs' \"law of the  case\" and\n\n\"waiver   of  unpleaded   affirmative  defense\"   arguments,  and\n\nconcluded that,  under New  Hampshire law, plaintiffs  had indeed\n\nratified their respective  resignation agreements and that  Moore\n\nwas entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n\n          Abbadessa and  Mariotti now appeal, raising  two of the\n\ngrounds  that  were before  the  district  court.   Specifically,\n\nplaintiffs maintain that the \"law of the case\" doctrine precluded\n\nthe district  court  from ruling  on Moore's  renewed motion  for\n\nsummary judgment,  and that there were genuine issues of material\n\nfact  as  to whether  plaintiffs  were capable  of  ratifying the\n\nresignation agreements. \n\n                                II\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\n          Our review  of the district court's  orders for summary\n\njudgment  is  plenary.

Moore, Federal  Practice  0.404[1]\n\n(1980).  \n\n          Here, the  district court,  in denying  Moore's initial\n\nmotions  for summary  judgment, decided  that there  were genuine\n\nissues of material fact as to whether Abbadessa and Mariotti were\n\nunder   such  economic  duress  at   the  time  they  signed  the\n\nresignation agreements as to render the agreements  voidable.  In\n\nits renewed motions for summary judgment, Moore argued that, even\n\nif  Abbadessa and Moore signed  the agreements under  the sort of\n\neconomic  duress  which  would render  the  agreements  voidable,\n\nAbbadessa and Mariotti had nonetheless ratified the agreements by\n\ntheir  subsequent conduct.   The issue  of whether  Abbadessa and\n\nMariotti ratified the agreements is  one which the district court\n\ndid  not consider, much less decide, in ruling on Moore's initial\n\nmotions for summary judgment.   \n\n          We have stated in this circuit that the doctrine of the\n\n\"law  of  the  case\" \"merely  expresses  the  practice  of courts\n\ngenerally to refuse to  open what has been decided.\"  Piazza, 909\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at  38.

Third, \"the  pressure  must have  been\n   \n\nwrongful.\"  Id.   An  act or  threat of  an  act may  be wrongful\n               \n\n\"although the  act or  threat is not  criminal or tortious  or in\n\nviolation  of a  contractual duty.\"  Id.

Thus, if the party relying on the theory  of economic duress\n   \n\n\"had a legal  remedy adequate  to redress or  compensate for  the\n\ninjury threatened, the threat will not amount to duress.\"  Id.\n                                                              \n\n          Given the  above definition  of economic  duress, there\n\nare, as  the district  court found, disputed  issues of  material\n\nfact  as  to  whether  Abbadessa and  Moore  satisfied  the  four\n\nelements  of duress.  Specifically,  looking at the  facts in the\n\nlight most  favorable to plaintiffs,  it is disputed  whether the\n\n\"coercive   circumstances\"  surrounding   the   signing  of   the\n\nresignation  agreements  were  \"the  result of  acts  of\"  Moore.\n\nAbbadessa  and  Mariotti  claim   that  Moore  created  \"coercive\n\ncircumstances\" by refusing to  negotiate any of the terms  of the\n\nagreements and by  withholding benefits plaintiffs were  entitled\n\nto  until  they signed  the agreement.    It is  further disputed\n\nwhether  the choice given by  Moore to Abbadessa  and Mariotti of\n\nresigning with benefits or  not resigning and risking termination\n\nwithout benefits  was \"wrongful.\"   Abbadessa and  Mariotti claim\n\n                               -15-\n                                15\n\nthat Moore's bargaining position was wrongful because it was done\n\nin  bad faith.    It  is finally  disputed whether  Abbadessa and\n\nMariotti  were left with \"no other alternatives but to accept the\n\nterms\" proposed by Moore.  Abbadessa and Mariotti claim that they\n\nwere not fully aware of  any internal appeal procedures available\n\nto them at  the time  they were presented  with the requests  for\n\nthem  to resign.  They also claim  that they were in no financial\n\nor mental shape to begin court actions.\n\n          Therefore,  assuming for  purposes of  summary judgment\n\nthat Abbadessa  and Mariotti signed the  agreements under duress,\n\nthe question now becomes whether Moore is nonetheless entitled to\n\njudgment  as  a matter  of  law  because Abbadessa  and  Mariotti\n\nratified the agreements by their subsequent actions.\n\n          In  New Hampshire,  voidable  contracts are  subject to\n\nratification.

Since a  contract  executed under  economic  duress is\n\nvoidable it is also  subject to ratification.  New  Hampshire has\n\nnever  specifically identified  the circumstances  under which  a\n\ncontract  executed under  economic duress  will be  considered to\n\nhave been ratified.   But generally, a voidable contract  will be\n\ndeemed to  have been ratified  when the party who  is entitled to\n\navoid  the contract \"does any act which amounts to a ratification\n\nafter full  knowledge of  all the  facts and  circumstances.\" Id.\n                                                                 \n\n                               -16-\n                                16\n\nActs amounting to ratification  are payment or acceptance  of the\n\nbenefits  of the contract  and failure to  repudiate the contract\n\npromptly.

After  his  benefits under  the January  19 agreement  had\n\nexpired, Abbadessa  requested that  Moore extend him  benefits on\n\nthree separate occasions.  Moore acceded to two of these requests\n\nand refused  to extend  added benefits  on Abbadessa's  third and\n\nfinal  request.    So,  from  February  1988  until  April  1988,\n\nAbbadessa  treated  the agreement  as  binding  by accepting  the\n\nbenefits  Moore had promised.   Moreover,  from April  1988 until\n\nJune 1988,  Abbadessa further ratified the  original agreement by\n\nmaking three  separate requests that Moore  extend benefits which\n\nwere not  owed under the agreement.  It was not until after Moore\n\nhad  refused  additional extensions  of  benefits  that Abbadessa\n\nnotified  Moore's  counsel by  letter in  July  1988 that  he had\n\nsigned the agreement under duress.  Finally, even after Abbadessa\n\nhad filed his  suit against Moore, at no point  did he attempt to\n\nreturn to Moore the benefits of the agreement which he now claims\n\nhe signed under duress.\n\n          Similarly,  Mariotti considered  his agreement  for two\n\ndays  before  signing  it.   From  May  1988  until August  1988,\n\nMariotti continued  to receive the benefits  under the agreement.\n\nEven after  Mariotti supposedly  wrote to  Moore Counsel  in July\n\n1988  that he  had  signed the  agreement  under the  duress,  he\n\ncontinued to received the benefits under the agreement for August\n\n                               -18-\n                                18\n\n1988.   As with Abbadessa,  even after having  filed suit against\n\nMoore, at no  point did Mariotti  attempt to return to  Moore the\n\nbenefits of the  agreement which  he now claims  he signed  under\n\nduress.\n\n          The Supreme Court of New  Hampshire has written that \"a\n\nperson seeking to rescind cannot treat the contract  as rescinded\n\nand binding at  the same time.\"  Sawtelle, 201 A.2d  at 115.   By\n                                         \n\naccepting the benefits of their respective resignation agreements\n\nand by failing  to notify  Moore promptly that  they intended  to\n\nrepudiate  the agreements,  Abbadessa  and  Mariotti treated  the\n\nagreements as  binding.  After having  done so, they  now wish to\n\ntreat the  agreements as  rescinded.   That, under  New Hampshire\n\nlaw, they may not do.\n\n          Abbadessa and  Mariotti argue that they  could not have\n\npossibly  ratified  the agreements  until  after  the duress  was\n\nremoved.  Since, according to Abbadessa and Mariotti, they signed\n\nthe agreements under duress because basically, by  asking them to\n\nresign, Moore caused them to  be in desperate need for money,  we\n\nunderstand plaintiffs'  argument to  mean that duress  would have\n\nbeen  removed when  they were  no longer  in such  dire financial\n\nstraits.  But, as we stated  at the outset of our discussion, the\n\nissue in this case is whether appellants raised genuine issues of\n\nmaterial  fact  as  to  whether they  ratified  their  respective\n\n                               -19-\n                                19\n\nagreements.   Stated  another  way: whether  they raised  genuine\n\nissues  of material  fact that  the claimed  duress had  not been\n\nremoved  between the time they signed the agreements and the time\n\nthey  brought this action.   Appellants have failed  to raise any\n\nfacts  to that effect.  While Moore has advanced undisputed facts\n\nthat  appellants  accepted  the  benefits  of   their  respective\n\nagreements,  Abbadessa   and  Mariotti  have   offered  no  facts\n\n(disputed  or  undisputed) about  how  long  the economic  duress\n\nlasted;  or put  another way,  if and  when their  claimed duress\n\nceased.3  Having  failed to satisfy  their burden of  production,\n\n                       \n\n   3We  should also point out  that we have  found no authority\n   that New  Hampshire has  adopted or  would adopt  the theory\n   that a contract signed under  economic duress is capable  of\n   being  ratified only after the duress is removed.   The only\n   case from  this circuit addressing  the issue is  Ismert and\n                                                               \n   Associates, Inc.  v.

In that case,  this circuit\n   considered  an action  brought by  a tax  consulting service\n   firm against an insurance company.  The firm argued that the\n   agreement  it had  signed, releasing  the  insurance company\n   from any claims  resulting from the firm's  loss of business\n   opportunities, was  unenforceable  because it  was  obtained\n   under duress.  Judge Maletz authored the majority opinion as\n   well as a dissent.  In  his dissent on the issue of economic\n   duress, Judge Maletz wrote that  \"there can be no affirmance\n   [of a contract]  unless the  duress has  ended.\" Ismert  and\n                                                               \n   Associates, 801 F.2d at 548.  Judge  Breyer, writing for the\n             \n   majority  on the  question of  duress,  did not  address the\n   issue  of  whether a  contract  signed under  duress  is not\n   capable  of  being  ratified  until the  duress  has  ended.\n   Instead,  Judge Breyer found  that plaintiff had  not made a\n   sufficient  showing  that it  signed  the release  agreement\n   under  duress. Id..   In  Ismert, this circuit  was applying\n                                   \n   Massachusetts law.  Thus, the decision is not controlling in\n   this  case  involving  New  Hampshire law.
