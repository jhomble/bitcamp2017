After Williams  was\n\ndiagnosed with a  herniated disc, he filed a  claim against Jones\n\nfor compensation benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers'\n\nCompensation Act (LHWCA),  33 U.S.C.    901-50.1  In  March 1981,\n\na Department of Labor (DOL)  administrative law judge (ALJ) found\n\nthat Williams had a \"temporary total disability,\" see id.    908-\n                                                         \n\n(b), and ordered Jones to commence immediate payments to Williams\n\nin an  amount equal to  two-thirds of  Williams's average  weekly\n\n                    \n\n     1The  LHWCA is  a comprehensive  statutory scheme  governing\ncompensation for  covered employees (e.g.,  longshoremen) due  to\n                                         \nloss  of  earning  capacity caused  by  injuries  sustained while\nengaged in \"maritime employment\" upon the navigable waters of the\nUnited States, or  upon designated lands adjoining  those waters.\nSee  33  U.S.C.    902,  903.   Like state  workers' compensation\n   \nstatutes, the LHWCA contemplates a relinquishment  of substantive\nrights  by both parties; employers are liable for compensation to\nthe disabled  employee \"irrespective of  [the employers'] fault,\"\nid.    904,  while  employees' LHWCA administrative  and judicial\n   \nremedies against their employer are exclusive, see id.   905; see\n                                                                 \nalso  Potomac  Elec.

See  33  U.S.C.   912.\n                                              \nWithin  14 days  of such  notice,  or after  obtaining actual  or\nconstructive knowledge of the employee's disability, the employer\nmust either  (1) commence payments  to the employee in  an amount\nequal to two-thirds of the employee's \"average weekly wages,\" see\n                                                                 \nid.    906, 908, 910, or  (2) notify the United States Department\n   \nof Labor (DOL) that the  employee's right to compensation will be\ncontested, specifying  the grounds.

If the\n                                             \nemployer contests, the employee has one year from the date of his\ninjury,  or one year from  the employer's last voluntary payment,\nto file a written claim with the DOL.

Notwithstanding  two successful  appeals  to the  Benefits\n\nReview Board (BRB)  by Jones, see  id.   921(b),3 ultimately  the\n                                      \n\nBRB  affirmed a  compensation award  in  favor of  Williams.   We\n\ndenied Jones's  petition for  judicial review in  1990.   See id.\n                                                                 \n\n  921(c).  Notwithstanding the finality of the compensation award\n\n                    \n\n     2Within  ten days after the employee files an administrative\nclaim, see  supra note 1, the DOL must  cause notice to be served\n                 \non  all interested  parties,  including  the  employer,  see  id.\n                                                                 \n  919(b),  and  conduct  all  necessary  investigations  of   the\nemployee's claim, see id. 919(c);  see also 20 C.F.R.    702.331-\n                                           \n702.351 (1993).  At  least ten days' notice of the    919 eviden-\ntiary  hearing must  be  provided to  all interested  parties, by\npersonal service or registered mail.  Id.  Section 919 evidentia-\n                                         \nry hearings are  conducted pursuant to the  Administrative Proce-\ndures Act, 5 U.S.C.   554,  by an ALJ.  Within 20 days  after the\nhearing, the  ALJ  must either  reject the  employee's claim,  or\nissue a  compensation order  designating  the extent  of the  em-\nployee's \"disability\"  (e.g., permanent  total, temporary  total,\n                            \npermanent partial) and  setting the amount of  biweekly compensa-\ntion.  The ALJ's  compensation order becomes \"effective\"  as soon\nas it is duly filed in  the appropriate DOL office and notice  of\nthe  filing  is mailed  to the  employee and  the employer.   Id.\n                                                                 \n   919(e), 921(a).  The employer's obligation to pay compensation\nto  the employee  commences on  the date  the ALJ's  compensation\norder becomes \"effective.\"\n\n     3See Williams  v. Nicole  Enters., Inc.,  15  Ben. Rev.  Bd.\n                                            \nServ. 453 (1983); Williams v.  Nicole Enters., Inc., 19 Ben.

Once an ALJ's compensation order becomes\n\"effective,\"  the nonprevailing party  has 30 days  to appeal the\norder (or the ALJ's rejection of the  claim) to the BRB, a three-\nmember appellate panel  within the DOL.  See  33 U.S.C.   921(b).\n                                            \nThe BRB must  accept all ALJ factual findings  supported by \"sub-\nstantial evidence.\"   Id.  If the BRB  affirms, the nonprevailing\n                         \nparty may petition for  judicial review by the appropriate  court\nof  appeals, which  will apply  the  same \"substantial  evidence\"\nstandard of review to  the ALJ's factual findings,  but otherwise\nhas jurisdiction  to affirm, modify,  set aside,  or enforce  the\n                                                            \nALJ's compensation order.  Id.   921(c).  If no party appeals the\n                              \nALJ's  order to  the BRB,  it becomes \"final\"  30 days  after the\nparties are  notified that it  has been filed in  the appropriate\nDOL office pursuant to   919(e).  Id.   921(a).\n                                     \n\n                                4\n\nfor LHWCA  purposes, see supra  note 3, Williams alleges  that he\n                              \n\nhas received only $450 in benefit payments from Jones to date.\n\n          On  August 7, 1992,  Williams brought  the present  en-\n\nforcement action  in federal  district court,  pursuant to  LHWCA\n\nsubsections 921(d) and (e):\n\n          (d) If any employer or his officers or agents\n          fails  to comply  with  a compensation  order\n          making an award,  that has become  final, any\n          beneficiary of such award or  the deputy com-\n          missioner making the order, may apply for the\n          enforcement of the order to the  Federal dis-\n          trict  court  for  the  judicial district  in\n          which  the injury  occurred  . . . .   If the\n                                                       \n          court determines that the  order was made and\n                          \n          served  in accordance with law, and that such\n                                             \n          employer  or  his  officers  or  agents  have\n          failed to  comply therewith, the  court shall\n                                                       \n          enforce obedience  to  the order  by writ  of\n                                                       \n          injunction or by other proper process, manda-\n                       \n          tory or otherwise, to enjoin upon such person\n          and his officers  and agents compliance  with\n          the order.\n\n          (e)  Proceedings   for  suspending,   setting\n          aside,  or  enforcing a  compensation  order,\n          whether rejecting a claim or making an award,\n          shall  not  be instituted  otherwise  than as\n                                                       \n          provided in this section . . . .\n                  \n\n33 U.S.C.   921(d), (e) (emphasis added).\n\n          Jones  opposed  the  petition  for  enforcement on  the\n\ngrounds that  \"newly discovered\" evidence  revealed that Williams\n\nsecured the  award through  perjury and fraud,  and that  the en-\n\nforcement  petition was not  served on  Jones in  compliance with\n\nFed.  R. Civ.  P. 4.   A  magistrate  judge recommended  that the\n\npetition  for enforcement be granted because Jones was precluded,\n\nas a  matter of law, from pleading  these defenses in an enforce-\n\nment  action brought pursuant  to LHWCA section 921(d).   Jones's\n\n                                5\n\nappeal  from the  district court  order  adopting the  magistrate\n\njudge's  recommended decision  presents two  important issues  of\n\nfirst impression relating to the LHWCA's enforcement provisions.\n\nI. Insufficient Process and Service of Process.\n                                              \n\n          Jones  concedes  actual  notice of  the  filing  of the\n\nsection  921(d) enforcement petition with the district court, but\n\npleads insufficient process and insufficient  service of process,\n\nsee Fed. R.  Civ. P. 12(b)(4), (5), based  on Williams's admitted\n   \n\nfailure to serve Jones pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4.  See Durbin\n                                                                 \n\nPaper Stock Co. v.  Hossain, 97 F.R.D. 639, 639 (S.D.  Fla. 1982)\n                           \n\n(\"Service of  process is not  effectual on an attorney  solely by\n\nreason of  his capacity  as an attorney,  [but] [t]he  party must\n\nhave  appointed his  attorney as  his agent  for service  of pro-\n\ncess.\") (collecting cases); cf.

Jones's first  \"response\" to Williams's  peti-\ntion,  filed  on  August 21, 1992,  did  not  contest  service of\nprocess  pursuant to  Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 12(h)(1)(A).   Five  days\nlater,  however, Jones filed his answer and counterclaim, raising\nthe  insufficient  process  and service  of  process  defenses in\ntimely fashion.   See  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 12(h)(1)(B)  (defense not\n                     \nwaived if  raised in \"matter  of course\" Rule 15(a)  amendment to\nresponsive  pleading within  20  days of  initial  answer).

R. Civ. P. 4 and 81(a)(6); without\n\nit, he argues, the district  court did not obtain personal juris-\n\ndiction over him.\n\n          The magistrate judge rejected Jones's argument,  citing\n\nJourdan v. Equitable Equip. Co., 889 F.2d 637 (5th Cir. 1989),  a\n                               \n\ncase  involving companion LHWCA  section 918(a).   Section 918(a)\n\nenforcement proceedings normally are used to enforce compensation\n\nawards  which have  become \"effective\" but  are not  yet \"final\";\n\nthat  is, during the  pendency of an  appeal to the  BRB from the\n\nALJ's initial  award, or from  the BRB to  the court  of appeals.\n\nSee supra notes  2 and 3.   Within one  year after an  employer's\n         \n\ndefault, the  employee may apply  to an ALJ for  a \"supplementary\n\norder\" declaring the  amount in default.   The ALJ may  not issue\n\nthe  supplementary  order  except  \"[a]fter investigation,  [and]\n\nnotice,  and hearing.\"   Even  then,  however, the  supplementary\n\norder is not  self-executing.  Rather, the claimant,  or the ALJ,\n\nmust file  a certified copy  of the supplementary order  with the\n\nappropriate federal district  court, which \"shall upon  filing of\n                                                              \n\nthe copy enter judgment for  the amount declared in default . . .\n\nif such supplementary order is in accordance with law.\"5\n\n                    \n\n     5LHWCA   918(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n     (a) In case  of default by the employer  in the payment\n     of compensation due under any award of compensation for\n     a  period of thirty days after  the compensation is due\n     and  payable, the person  to whom such  compensation is\n     payable may, within  one year after such  default, make\n     application to the [ALJ] making the  compensation order\n     for a supplementary  order declaring the amount  of the\n\n                                7\n\n          The  Jourdan court held that the obligatory language of\n                      \n\nsection 918(a) evinced  a clear congressional intent  to dispense\n\nwith the  \"service of process\" requirements of  Fed. R. Civ. P. 4\n\nin  a section 918(a)  enforcement proceeding brought  in the dis-\n\ntrict court.   The magistrate  judge in the present  case, analo-\n\ngizing from Jourdan, reasoned that,\n                   \n\n          [l]ike Section 918(a), Section 921(d) utiliz-\n          es imperative language; upon certain findings\n          the court  \"shall enforce.\"  The only differ-\n          ence is the lack of specificity regarding the\n                                         \n          method  for  filing  the  \"application.\"   In\n          either case, the court must make  preliminary\n          findings that  amount to nothing more  than a\n          procedural review of  the underlying process.\n                                                      \n          Assuming there  were no procedural  errors at\n                                                       \n          the  administrative level,  the court  has no\n                                                       \n          choice  but to enforce the order.  Again, the\n                \n          court has no jurisdiction  over the merits of\n          the action.   The aggrieved  party would have\n                                                       \n          no additional opportunity to be heard even if\n                                                       \n          notice were provided according to the  strict\n                                                       \n          requirements of Rule 4.   The logical conclu-\n                                \n          sion  is  that  Section 921(d)  is  a summary\n\n                    \n\n     default.  After investigation, notice, and hearing,  as\n     provided  in  section  [919], the  [ALJ]  shall  make a\n     supplementary  order, declaring  the amount of  the de-\n     fault, which shall  be filed in the same  manner as the\n     compensation order.   In case the payment in default is\n     an  installment of  the award,  the [ALJ]  may, in  his\n     discretion,  declare  the  whole of  the  award  as the\n     amount in default.  The applicant may file  a certified\n     copy  of such supplementary order with the clerk of the\n     Federal district  court for  the  judicial district  in\n     which  the employer has his principal place of business\n     or maintains an office, or for the judicial district in\n     which the  injury occurred.  ...    Such  supplementary\n     order shall  be final,  and the  court  shall upon  the\n     filing of  the copy enter  judgment for the  amount de-\n     clared  in default by  the supplementary order  if such\n     supplementary  order is in accordance with law.

Jones,  No. 92-0156-B, slip op. at 6 (D. Me. Oct. 27,\n                 \n\n1992) (recommended decision) (emphasis added).\n\n          Assuming, arguendo, that Jourdan  is correctly decided,\n                                          \n\nsection 921(d) is  insufficiently analogous to section  918(a) to\n\nbear  the weight  given  it in  the  recommended decision  below.\n\nSection  918(a)'s   bifurcated  enforcement   mechanism  requires\n                                                                 \n\nadministrative notice to the employer,  as well as an opportunity\n                     \n\nto be heard, prior to  the entry of any supplementary enforcement\n                  \n\norder by  the ALJ.   See supra notes  2 and 5.   Long before  the\n                              \n\nemployee  ever files the ALJ's certified supplementary order with\n\nthe district  court, therefore,  the  procedural requirements  of\n\nsection 918(a) itself have  assured that the employer  was placed\n\non  notice of the impending judicial enforcement proceeding.  The\n\ndistrict  court is  expressly  charged  with determining  whether\n\n\"such supplementary  order [was]  in  accordance with  law.\"   33\n\nU.S.C.    918(a).   Thus, section  918(a) envisions  an ancillary\n\ndistrict court mechanism for enforcing supplementary  enforcement\n\norders entered by the ALJ.  Arguably,  at least, this is the sort\n\nof administrative alternative  to service of process  which would\n\npreempt the Rule 4 service of process requirement under Fed. Rule\n\nCiv.  P. 81(a)(6).6    In  contrast, however,  no  notice to  the\n\n                    \n\n     6Analogous Rule 81(a)(5), governing the applicability of the\nCivil Rules to NLRB proceedings, likewise illuminates the present\ninquiry.  See Fed. R. Civ.  P. 81(a)(5) (\"in respects not covered\n             \n\n                                9\n\nemployer  is required  prior  to the  commencement  of a  section\n\n921(d) enforcement action in the district court.  See supra p. 4.\n                                                           \n\n          In addition,  we detect  no intimation,  either in  the\n\nstatutory  language  or legislative  history, that  Congress con-\n\ntemplated a section 921(d)  proceeding quite so summary as  indi-\n\ncated in  the recommended  decision.  Even  assuming that  a full\n\npanoply of equitable defenses is  not available to an employer in\n\na  section 921(d)  enforcement action,  see infra  pt. II,  it is\n                                                 \n\nnonetheless clear that  the employer may contest  factual allega-\n\ntions upon which  the section 921(d) enforcement  petition neces-\n\nsarily  depends,7 including the  main issue whether  the employer\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\nby [29  U.S.C.    159, 160]  the practice in the  district courts\nshall conform to these rules as far as applicable\").  In contrast\nto LHWCA   921(d), however, the NLRB sections referenced in  Rule\n81(a)(5) contain  detailed provisions relating to the filing of a\npetition to enforce an NLRB order.  See 29 U.S.C.   160(e) (\"Upon\n                                       \nfiling of such  a petition, the court shall  cause notice thereof\n                                     \nto be served upon such person, and thereupon shall have jurisdic-\n                                                                 \ntion  of the proceeding  and of the  question determined therein,\n                       \nand shall have power to  grant such temporary relief or restrain-\ning order as it deems just and proper . . . .\") (emphasis added).\n\n     7Although  clearly treated by  the parties and  the district\ncourt as a    921(d) action, Williams's petition  for enforcement\nis an odd hybrid.  Initially, Williams presented his petition for\nenforcement to  the DOL.  In a  June 30, 1992 letter to Williams,\nthe District Director of the DOL determined that the compensation\norder was \"final,\"  that it was made and  administratively served\n\"in  accordance with  law,\"  and  that Jones  was  in default  on\npayments.   Under   921(d),  these administrative  determinations\nwere  supererogatory.   Unlike   918(a),    921(d)  expressly re-\nserves such matters for resolution by the district court.  See 33\n                                                              \nU.S.C.   921(d) (\"If the court determines that the order was made\n                                         \nand served  in accordance  with law  . . . .\") (emphasis  added).\n          \nAlthough the district  court correctly noted  that Jones did  not\ncontest these matters (e.g., the  giving of notice as required in\n                           \nthe administrative proceedings under   919), the applicability of\n                  \nthe  Rule 4 service of process requirement is not made to depend,\nsee Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(a)(6), upon whether the defendant-employer\n   \nreceived  notice in  the administrative  proceeding, but  whether\n        \n\n                                10\n\nis in default.   Moreover, arguably at least,  the employer might\n             \n\nbe  entitled to  raise  factual challenges  relating  to (1)  the\n\namount  in default,8 (2) whether  new evidence indicates that the\n\ninitial compensation order was procedurally  defective, or other-\n\nwise not \"in  accordance with law,\" or (3)  employee conduct that\n\nmight  tilt  the  fundamental balance  of  equities  in favor  of\n\njudicial restraint.   See  infra note 18.   Moreover,  unlike the\n                                \n\nbifurcated  process involved  in  a  section  918(a)  enforcement\n          \n\nproceeding,  which presumes  prior  notice  and  hearing  at  the\n\nadministrative  level, section  921(d)  constitutes the  district\n\ncourt  the employer's first and only  forum for a full hearing of\n                                    \n\nsuch  factual disputes  prior to  the issuance  of  an injunctive\n\n                    \n\n\"matters of procedure are provided for in\" the LHWCA, id. (empha-\n                                                         \nsis added).  Since there  is no LHWCA provision governing service\nof process  upon the  defendant employer  in a    921(d) judicial\nenforcement proceeding, the district  court erred in  determining\nthat service of  process in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 and\n81(a)(6) was not necessary. \n     Moreover, although  the DOL  letter of  June 1992  contained\nfindings  analogous to those  required under LHWCA    918(a), see\n                                                                 \nsupra  note 5,  it could  not qualify  as a    918 \"supplementary\n     \norder,\" since (1) there is  no record evidence that Jones contem-\nporaneously received the letter, or any notice of it, (2) the DOL\ndid not conduct a   919 hearing prior to  issuance of the letter,\n(3)  the copy  of the DOL  letter filed  with the  district court\nenforcement  petition was  not  \"certified,\" and  (4)  Williams's\ndistrict  court  petition  specifically  invokes  subject  matter\njurisdiction under section 921(d) only.\n\n     8Williams conceded  that Jones  was making  payments at  the\ntime of the district court  order, but insisted that the enforce-\nment petition sought to compel payment of the \"arrearages\" dating\n                                                         \nfrom October 1978.  The  magistrate judge concluded that   921(d)\ndiffered from   918(a),  in that  it permits  the enforcement  of\nprospective compensation orders only, compelling future  payments\nto  be made  as they  come  due but  not recoveries  of  past due\npayments.   Williams,  slip  op.  at 3  (citing  Henry v.  Gentry\n                                                                 \nPlumbing &amp;  Heating Co.,  704 F.2d 863  (5th Cir. 1983)).   Since\n                       \nWilliams has not cross-appealed, we do not address this question.\n\n                                11\n\nenforcement  order,  with  its  attendant  exposure  to  coercive\n\ncontempt proceedings.\n\n          The recommended  decision observes that even  without a\n\nformal Rule 4 service of  process requirement the district  court\n\ncould notify  an employer  informally in  those  cases where  the\n                                     \n\ncourt  believed  that  an  employee's  petition  for  enforcement\n\ninvolved controverted  factual matters.   But of  course such  an\n\napproach could  afford adequate  safeguards only  if the  factual\n\nconflicts were apparent  on the face  of the employee's  petition\n                                                                 \n\nfor enforcement.  Otherwise, there could be no assurance that the\n\nrespondent-employer would have  either notice  or opportunity  to\n\nassert a challenge.  Thus, to construe Rule 81(a)(6) as excepting\n\nsection  921(d) enforcement actions  from the service  of process\n\nrequirements  of Rule  4,  merely because  the  employer did  not\n\ninterpose opposition  to the  enforcement petition, could  expose\n\nemployers to ex parte enforcement orders.\n                     \n\n          Finally, Williams  suggests that  requiring service  of\n\nprocess  in a section 921(d) enforcement proceeding could subvert\n\nthe  LHWCA goal of  ensuring prompt compliance  with compensation\n\norders.  Granting the premise of Williams's LHWCA policy argument\n\nin  principle, whatever  slight  delay  might  be  occasioned  by\n\nrequiring proper service of process  in order to enable the court\n\nto  obtain in personam  jurisdiction over employers  hardly seems\n\n                                12\n\ninappropriate,  especially  in  light of  the  simplicity  of the\n\nprocedure.9\n\n          Sections  918(a) and 921(d) serve distinct roles in the\n\nLHWCA remedial scheme.  Section 918(a) designedly affords injured\n\nemployees a  convenient, inexpensive,  and expeditious  mechanism\n\nfor facilitating enforcement  of \"effective\" compensation  awards\n\neven before they  have become \"final\".  Congress  anticipated the\n                                    \n\nsevere  financial hardships that could beset injured employees as\n\na result of lengthy appeals.  It therefore settled on the section\n\n918(a)  enforcement action  as a  simple means  to compel  prompt\n\nemployer  compliance with  an enforcement  award  even though  it\n\nmight later  be set aside on review.  See, e.g., Tidelands Marine\n                                                                 \n\nServ. v.

At the  October 23,\n\n1992 hearing before  the magistrate judge, Jones  proffered three\n\naffidavits  from  individuals  who  had accompanied  Williams  on\n\nnumerous clamming and lobstering expeditions between October 1978\n\nand March 1981.  These affidavits attest that Williams engaged in\n\nthe very types  of heavy labor and lifting  explicitly disclaimed\n\nin his testimony before the ALJ in 1980.  Jones contends that the\n\nidentity of  the affiants could not have  been discovered earlier\n\nin the exercise of reasonable diligence, since Jones only learned\n\nof  their existence through a \"chance  conversation\" in August or\n\nSeptember of 1992.\n\n          With  respect to  the  affirmative defenses,  Jones re-\n\nquested alternative forms of equitable relief:  (1) denial of the\n\nenforcement  order on  the  ground  that a  party  who obtains  a\n\ncompensation  award through fraud is not entitled to its enforce-\n\nment by injunction, or (2) a temporary stay of the section 921(d)\n\nenforcement action pending  administrative relief  from the  DOL.\n\nWith respect  to the state-law  counterclaim, see Me.

In Marshall,  the employer attempted to  liti-\n                              \ngate  core factual  issues (e.g., LHWCA  coverage and  statute of\n                                \nlimitations) for  the first time in a   921(d) proceeding, having\n                                \nfailed to raise them before  the ALJ, or to appeal the  compensa-\ntion order to the BRB.  Id. at 937.  The Marshall court correctly\n                                                 \nrelied on the  fact that, by its amendments to the LHWCA in 1972,\nCongress  unequivocally divested the district court of all appel-\nlate functions relating to ALJ compensation orders.  But Marshall\n                                                                 \ndid  not  involve the  more  difficult  problems posed  by  newly\ndiscovered evidence  of fraud.   Arguably,  at least,  successful\ninvocation of an equitable defense to enforcement would not  work\n                                                 \nan  appellate affirmance, modification, or vacation of the under-\n             \nlying  compensation order,  but merely  a refusal  to deploy  the\nequitable powers of  the court in aid of  a judgment fraudulently\nobtained.   Thus, Marshall's admonition that the district court's\n                          \nfunction  is reduced to \"screening compensation orders for proce-\ndural  defects\"  does not  purport  to preclude  exercise  of the\ncourt's traditional  discretionary  power to  grant  or  withhold\nequitable relief.  See infra note 18.\n                            \n\n                                19\n\ntion of  the district  court's equitable  powers,15 we  must look\n\nto the LHWCA's remedial framework as a whole.\n\n          The LHWCA affords Jones an adequate remedy for redress-\n\ning any  fraud  alleged in  the affirmative  defense.   Eschewing\n\nconventional  res  judicata  principles,  section  922 allows  an\n                           \n\nemployer to  request the ALJ  to reconsider the case  where there\n\nhas been a \"change of conditions\" or \"mistake of fact\" warranting\n\nmodification  or suspension  in compensation  payments.

Similarly,  an  employer would  be  allowed an\n\nappeal  from a  district  court  decision  which  discounted  the\n\nemployer's equitable  defenses  and  directed  enforcement  of  a\n\ncompensation award.

Stay of Enforcement.\n                             \n\n          The remaining question  is somewhat narrower:   may the\n\ndistrict  court in a section 921(d) proceeding temporarily enjoin\n\nenforcement  of  a   compensation  order  pending  administrative\n\nresolution  of  an  employer's  petition  for modification  under\n\nsection 922?19  Jones contends that he will be harmed irreparably\n\nabsent  a  stay  of the  section  921(d)  enforcement proceeding,\n\nbecause the compensation  payments he is compelled  to make prior\n\nto any  section 922 modification order would  not be recoverable.\n\nSee supra note 10.\n         \n\n          Only  two  LHWCA provisions  explicitly allow  stays of\n\n\"effective\" compensation orders.   See 33 U.S.C.     921(b) (stay\n                                      \n\npending appeal to  BRB), 921(c) (stay pending appeal  from BRB to\n\ncourt  of appeals),  thus underscoring  the  strong LHWCA  policy\n\nfavoring prompt  compensation payments even though the employee's\n\nentitlement to  disability benefits  remains in  genuine dispute.\n\nStays pending  administrative and  judicial review  are available\n\nonly  on a showing of \"irreparable injury.\"   See Henry, 704 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  865.  It  is not  enough that  the employer  demonstrate that\n\ninterim  payments would be unrecoverable absent  a stay, nor that\n\nthe employer  is  experiencing  financial  difficulty  in  making\n\npayments.   Edwards v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n     19We address this issue in  the interests of judicial econo-\nmy.   It is possible,  even likely,  that Jones's    922 petition\nwill have been acted upon by the DOL before Jones has been served\nwith process  pursuant to  Civil Rule 4  following remand  to the\ndistrict court.  If  not, it seems quite likely  that Jones would\nrenew his request for a stay of the   921(d) enforcement proceed-\ning.\n\n                                24\n\n932 F.2d 1325, 1329 (9th Cir. 1991). \"Irreparable injury\" will be\n\nfound only in extraordinary circumstances.  Id.\n                                               \n\n          Unlike  the  minimal  time delays  required  to  effect\n\nproper service  of process,  see supra pt.  I, a stay  of section\n                                      \n\n921(d)  enforcement  proceedings  while  an  employer  pursues  a\n\nmodification ruling from the DOL (and, perhaps, pending appellate\n\nreview)  threatens  a  lengthy delay  in  the  previously ordered\n\ncompensation  payments to  the employee.    Therefore, under  the\n\n\"inescapable inference\" standard established  in Porter, 328 U.S.\n                                                       \n\nat  398, we  must conclude  that the  LHWCA divests  the district\n\ncourt of  the equitable power  to defer  its entry  of a  section\n\n921(d) enforcement  order pending  the outcome  of a section  922\n\nmodification  proceeding unless  the  employer first  establishes\n\n\"irreparable injury.\"   As we have noted, Jones's  answer did not\n\nallege facts sufficient to establish irreparable injury, nor does\n\nthe record suggest a basis for such a showing.  Thus,  the magis-\n\ntrate judge did not  err in failing to  act on the request  for a\n\ntemporary stay.\n\nIII. Conclusion.\n               \n\n          The district  court order directing enforcement  of the\n\ncompensation  order  pursuant  to LHWCA  section  921(d)  must be\n\nvacated due  to lack  of compliance with  the service  of process\n\nrequirements imposed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 and 81(a)(6).  The case\n\nmust be remanded to permit  Williams to effect service of process\n\nupon  Jones.   At such  time as service  of process  is effected,\n\nJones should be permitted to submit for  district court consider-\n\n                                25\n\nation any  order obtained in  the LHWCA section  922 modification\n\nproceeding,  failing which the  district court may  reinstate the\n\nsection 921(d) enforcement order previously entered.\n\n          The  enforcement order  is  vacated  and  the  case  is\n                                                                 \n\nremanded to permit service of process and for further proceedings\n                                                                 \n\nin  accordance herewith.

A magistrate judge recommended that the petition for enforcement be granted because Jones was precluded, as a matter of law, from pleading these defenses in an enforcement action brought pursuant to LHWCA section 921(d).

See Durbin Paper Stock Co. v.

Equitable Equip.  Co., 889 F.2d 637 (5th Cir.1989), a case involving companion LHWCA section 918(a).  Section 918(a) enforcement proceedings normally are used to enforce compensation awards which have become \"effective\" but are not yet \"final\";  that is, during the pendency of an appeal to the BRB from the ALJ's initial award, or from the BRB to the court of appeals.  See supra notes 2 and 3.  Within one year after an employer's default, the employee may apply to an ALJ for a \"supplementary order\" declaring the amount in default.  The ALJ may not issue the supplementary order except \"[a]fter investigation, [and] notice, and hearing.\"   Even then, however, the supplementary order is not self-executing.  Rather, the claimant, or the ALJ, must file a certified copy of the supplementary order with the appropriate federal district court, which \"shall upon filing of the copy enter judgment for the amount declared in default ... if such supplementary order is in accordance with law.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Jourdan court held that the obligatory language of section 918(a) evinced a clear congressional intent to dispense with the \"service of process\" requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 in a section 918(a) enforcement proceeding brought in the district court.  The magistrate judge in the present case, analogizing from Jourdan, reasoned that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>[l]ike Section 918(a), Section 921(d) utilizes imperative language;  upon certain findings the court \"shall enforce.\"   The only difference is the lack of specificity regarding the method for filing the \"application.\"   In either case, the court must make preliminary findings that amount to nothing more than a procedural review of the underlying process.   Assuming there were no procedural errors at the administrative level, the court has no choice but to enforce the order.  Again, the court has no jurisdiction over the merits of the action.  The aggrieved party would have no additional opportunity to be heard even if notice were provided according to the strict requirements of Rule 4.   The logical conclusion is that Section 921(d) is a summary proceeding, and that upon filing of appropriate documentation showing that the order is final, that it was properly served, and that the employer has failed to comply, the court should issue the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Williams v.

Section 918(a)'s bifurcated enforcement mechanism requires administrative notice to the employer, as well as an opportunity to be heard, prior to the entry of any supplementary enforcement order by the ALJ.  See supra notes 2 and 5.  Long before the employee ever files the ALJ's certified supplementary order with the district court, therefore, the procedural requirements of section 918(a) itself have assured that the employer was placed on notice of the impending judicial enforcement proceeding.  The district court is expressly charged with determining whether \"such supplementary order [was] in accordance with law.\"  33 U.S.C. Sec. 918(a).  Thus, section 918(a) envisions an ancillary district court mechanism for enforcing supplementary enforcement orders entered by the ALJ.  Arguably, at least, this is the sort of administrative alternative to service of process which would preempt the Rule 4 service of process requirement under Fed.Rule Civ.P. 81(a)(6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In contrast, however, no notice to the employer is required prior to the commencement of a section 921(d) enforcement action in the district court.

Even assuming that a full panoply of equitable defenses is not available to an employer in a section 921(d) enforcement action, see infra pt. II, it is nonetheless clear that the employer may contest factual allegations upon which the section 921(d) enforcement petition necessarily depends,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> including the main issue whether the employer is in default.   Moreover, arguably at least, the employer might be entitled to raise factual challenges relating to (1) the amount in default,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> (2) whether new evidence indicates that the initial compensation order was procedurally defective, or otherwise not \"in accordance with law,\" or (3) employee conduct that might tilt the fundamental balance of equities in favor of judicial restraint.  See infra note 18.  Moreover, unlike the bifurcated process involved in a section 918(a) enforcement proceeding, which presumes prior notice and hearing at the administrative level, section 921(d) constitutes the district court the employer's first and only forum for a full hearing of such factual disputes prior to the issuance of an injunctive enforcement order, with its attendant exposure to coercive contempt proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The recommended decision observes that even without a formal Rule 4 service of process requirement the district court could notify an employer informally in those cases where the court believed that an employee's petition for enforcement involved controverted factual matters.  But of course such an approach could afford adequate safeguards only if the factual conflicts were apparent on the face of the employee's petition for enforcement.  Otherwise, there could be no assurance that the respondent-employer would have either notice or opportunity to assert a challenge.  Thus, to construe Rule 81(a)(6) as excepting section 921(d) enforcement actions from the service of process requirements of Rule 4, merely because the employer did not interpose opposition to the enforcement petition, could expose employers to ex parte enforcement orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Williams suggests that requiring service of process in a section 921(d) enforcement proceeding could subvert the LHWCA goal of ensuring prompt compliance with compensation orders.  Granting the premise of Williams's LHWCA policy argument in principle, whatever slight delay might be occasioned by requiring proper service of process in order to enable the court to obtain in personam jurisdiction over employers hardly seems inappropriate, especially in light of the simplicity of the procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sections 918(a) and 921(d) serve distinct roles in the LHWCA remedial scheme.  Section 918(a) designedly affords injured employees a convenient, inexpensive, and expeditious mechanism for facilitating enforcement of \"effective\" compensation awards even before they have become \"final \".  Congress anticipated the severe financial hardships that could beset injured employees as a result of lengthy appeals.  It therefore settled on the section 918(a) enforcement action as a simple means to compel prompt employer compliance with an enforcement award even though it might later be set aside on review.  See, e.g., Tidelands Marine Serv. v. Patterson, 719 F.2d 126, 129 (5th Cir.1983) (Sec. 918(a) implements \"a theme central to the spirit, intent, and purposes of the LHWCA\");  Henry, 704 F.2d at 865.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  For some reason not disclosed in the appellate record, however, Williams failed to invoke the convenient, prompt, and inexpensive enforcement mechanism established under section 918(a) throughout the ten-year period spanned by Jones's numerous appeals.  Cf., e.g., Cassell v. Taylor, 243 F.2d 259, 260 (D.C.Cir.1957) (one-year statute of limitations under Sec. 918(a) bars recovery on supplemental order filed sixteen years after default on compensation award payments);  supra note 5.  Moreover, Williams chose not to cross-appeal from the district court's ruling that section 921(d) could not be used to recover past-due payments.  See supra note 8.  The avoidable and unexplained delay in Williams's efforts to recover these past-due compensation payments from Jones, however ill advised or unfortunate, does not permit disregard of the service of process requirements applicable to section 921(d) enforcement proceedings, particularly since compliance will entail no significant further delay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  But cf. infra pt. II.B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, proper service of process is no empty procedural exercise where an employee seeks to obtain a district court enforcement order under section 921(d) which may lead to contempt proceedings against the employer for noncompliance.  See Omni Capital Int'l, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff &amp; Co., 484 U.S. 97, 103, 108 S.Ct. 404, 409, 98 L.Ed.2d 415 (1987) (\"Before a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, the procedural requirement of service of summons must be satisfied.  '[S]ervice of summons is the procedure by which a court having venue and jurisdiction of the subject matter of the suit asserts jurisdiction over the person of the party served.' \")  (citing Mississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U.S. 438, 444-45, 66 S.Ct. 242, 245-46, 90 L.Ed. 185 (1946)) (emphasis added);  Precision Etchings &amp; Findings, Inc. v. LGP Gem, Ltd., 953 F.2d 21, 23-24 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that actual notice of lawsuit is no substitute for substantial compliance with FRCP 4(d)(1) [requiring service on person of defendant, on suitable resident at defendant's dwelling, or on defendant's \"agent\"];  \"a [ ] judgment entered by a court which lacks jurisdiction over the person of the defendant is void, and may be set aside at any time pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4).

Diaz-Marquez, 878 F.2d 1555, 1559 (1st Cir.1989) (\"[I]n the ordinary course, the district court acquires jurisdiction over a defendant only by service of process....\")  (emphasis added).  Accordingly, as we cannot find that Jones waived service of process, see supra note 4, we vacate the district court enforcement order, and remand for service of process pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>II. Equitable Defenses and the State-law Counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jones asserted two affirmative defenses and a state-law counterclaim based on allegations that Williams committed perjury before the ALJ in March 1980, and that, as a direct consequence, the ALJ found, incorrectly, that \"no laborious work\" had been performed by Williams after October 1978.  At the October 23, 1992 hearing before the magistrate judge, Jones proffered three affidavits from individuals who had accompanied Williams on numerous clamming and lobstering expeditions between October 1978 and March 1981.  These affidavits attest that Williams engaged in the very types of heavy labor and lifting explicitly disclaimed in his testimony before the ALJ in 1980.  Jones contends that the identity of the affiants could not have been discovered earlier in the exercise of reasonable diligence, since Jones only learned of their existence through a \"chance conversation\" in August or September of 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the affirmative defenses, Jones requested alternative forms of equitable relief:  (1) denial of the enforcement order on the ground that a party who obtains a compensation award through fraud is not entitled to its enforcement by injunction, or (2) a temporary stay of the section 921(d) enforcement action pending administrative relief from the DOL.  With respect to the state-law counterclaim, see Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 14, Sec. 870 (1992) (damages action for perjury), Jones requested compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that it had no \"jurisdiction\"--hence no discretion under LHWCA section 921(d)--to refuse to enforce the compensation order, except on the two grounds enumerated in the LHWCA, neither of which was contested by Jones;  namely, that Jones was not in default or that the compensation order was not made and served \"in accordance with law.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  On related grounds, the district court refused to exercise pendent jurisdiction over Jones's state-law counterclaim.  See United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1139, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).  The recommended decision did not address the request for a temporary stay of the section 921(d) enforcement proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Jones contends that the district court viewed its equitable powers under section 921(d) too narrowly.  See Restatement (Second) of Judgments Sec. 70, cmt. a (1982) (a court of equity will not enforce a judgment obtained by fraud).  Although the district court may have painted with too broad a brush, see, e.g., infra notes 14 and 18, we think its core conclusions were nonetheless sound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Equitable Power to Refuse Injunctive Enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An enforcement order under LHWCA section 921(d) may take the form of a writ of injunction, a traditional equitable remedy which may expose the enjoined party to the district court's coercive contempt powers.  Accordingly, fraud and \"unclean hands\" historically have been regarded as valid equitable defenses to injunctive relief, Loglan Inst., Inc. v. Logical Language Group, Inc., 962 F.2d 1038, 1042 (Fed.Cir.1992), and absent a controlling statute a federal court is presumed to possess the broad discretion and equitable power to configure its remedy to suit the needs of the case.  Even in the context of congressionally created injunctive remedies, the Supreme Court has said that \"[u]nless a statute in so many words, or by a necessary and inescapable inference, restricts the court's jurisdiction in equity, the full scope of that jurisdiction is to be recognized and applied.\"  Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398, 66 S.Ct. 1086, 1089, 90 L.Ed. 1332 (1946) (emphasis added).  See Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 313, 102 S.Ct. 1798, 1803, 72 L.Ed.2d 91 (1982) (\"[W]e do not lightly assume that Congress has intended to depart from established [equity] principles.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this rubric, the first question we confront is whether the LHWCA deprives the district court of its traditional discretionary powers to withhold equitable relief for the enforcement of a compensation award obtained through an employee's fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Since section 921(d) contains no explicit delimitation of the district court's equitable powers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> we must look to the LHWCA's remedial framework as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The LHWCA affords Jones an adequate remedy for redressing any fraud alleged in the affirmative defense.  Eschewing conventional res judicata principles, section 922 allows an employer to request the ALJ to reconsider the case where there has been a \"change of conditions\" or \"mistake of fact\" warranting modification or suspension in compensation payments.  See 33 U.S.C. Sec. 922;  see also 20 C.F.R. Sec. 702.373;  Hudson v. Southwestern Barge Fleet Servs., Inc., 16 Ben.Rev.Bd.Serv. 367, 369 (1984) (holding that Sec. 922 was \"intended by Congress to displace traditional notions of res judicata\") (citing Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers Ass'n, 390 U.S. 459, 88 S.Ct. 1140, 20 L.Ed.2d 30 (1968)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  \"[F]acts relating to the nature and extent of a claimant's disability typically are the subject of modification proceedings.\"   Williams v. Geosource, Inc., 13 Ben.Rev.Bd.Serv. 643, 645 (1981).  \"The factfinder [ALJ] has broad discretion to correct mistakes of fact, whether they be demonstrated by new evidence, cumulative evidence, or further reflection upon the evidence initially submitted.\"   Id. (emphasis added).  The overarching criterion for reopening a compensation award under the LHWCA is whether reexamination would serve the \"interests of justice.\"  O'Keeffe v. Aerojet-General Shipyards, Inc., 404 U.S. 254, 255-56, 92 S.Ct. 405, 406-07, 30 L.Ed.2d 424 (1971).  Perjured testimony resulting in an erroneous finding of fact concerning the nature or extent of an employee's disability would seem to come squarely within the realm of a \"mistake of fact.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 14, 1992, days before the recommended decision issued in this case, Jones filed a petition for modification pursuant to LHWCA section 922.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  In these circumstances, and against this legislative framework, we think there are at least two sound reasons for not inferring a congressional intention to dedicate two forums to the task of assessing alleged \"mistakes of fact\" relating to an employee's testimony before the ALJ.  First, where newly discovered evidence of fraud implicates the evidentiary basis for an employee's compensation claim, the LHWCA discloses a decided preference for utilizing the DOL's in-house expertise in resolving the dispute.  See, e.g., Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 46, 52 S.Ct. 285, 290, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932) (the LHWCA provides \"a prompt, continuous, expert and inexpensive method for dealing with a class of questions of fact which are peculiarly suited to examination and determination by an administrative agency specially assigned to that task\") (emphasis added);  cf. Youghiogheny &amp; Ohio Coal Co. v. Vahalik, 970 F.2d 161, 162 (6th Cir.1992) (\"the benefits of agency expertise become irrelevant\" under the LHWCA only after \"claim determination\" is complete).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under either section 921(d) or 922, the factfinder would be required to decide:  (1) whether Jones could have discovered the putative fraud earlier, in the exercise of due diligence;  (2) whether the affidavits proffered by Jones, together with the record evidence in the case before the DOL, credibly suggest that Williams misrepresented his physical capacities and activities during the relevant period;  and (3) whether the putative perjury was sufficiently material to undermine the ALJ's finding of temporary total disability.  See General Dynamics Corp. v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 673 F.2d 23, 25 (1st Cir.1982) (in reopening case, ALJ \"must balance the need to render justice against the need for finality in decisionmaking,\" and justice is not necessarily served where the employer \"could have presented his side of the case at the first hearing....\");  see also McCord v. Cephas, 4 Ben.Rev.Bd.Serv. 224, 225 (1976) (employer not entitled to modification if it exhibits a bad faith effort to relitigate issues ad nauseam).  We think the DOL is better positioned to address such issues in these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, section 922 modification rulings are appealable to the BRB and to the court of appeals.  See 33 U.S.C. Sec. 921(b), (c);  O'Loughlin v. Parker, 163 F.2d 1011, 1013 (4th Cir.1947) (ALJ's decision to reopen under section 922 is reviewed for abuse of discretion).  Similarly, an employer would be allowed an appeal from a district court decision which discounted the employer's equitable defenses and directed enforcement of a compensation award.  To allow the section 922 and the section 921(d) proceedings to go forward simultaneously would open up the possibility of inconsistent rulings on the fraud claim, which ultimately would have to be resolved by the court of appeals in either event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we can discern no good purpose for such a needless duplication of administrative and judicial effort, we conclude that LHWCA section 921(d), viewed in broad context, gives rise to the \"inescapable inference,\" see Porter, 328 U.S. at 398, 66 S.Ct. at 1089, that Congress did not intend the type of fraud defense here presented by Jones to be adjudicated by the district court but by the DOL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Stay of Enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining question is somewhat narrower:  may the district court in a section 921(d) proceeding temporarily enjoin enforcement of a compensation order pending administrative resolution of an employer's petition for modification under section 922?<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  Jones contends that he will be harmed irreparably absent a stay of the section 921(d) enforcement proceeding, because the compensation payments he is compelled to make prior to any section 922 modification order would not be recoverable.  See supra note 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only two LHWCA provisions explicitly allow stays of \"effective\" compensation orders.  See 33 U.S.C. Secs. 921(b) (stay pending appeal to BRB), 921(c) (stay pending appeal from BRB to court of appeals), thus underscoring the strong LHWCA policy favoring prompt compensation payments even though the employee's entitlement to disability benefits remains in genuine dispute.  Stays pending administrative and judicial review are available only on a showing of \"irreparable injury.\"   See Henry, 704 F.2d at 865.   It is not enough that the employer demonstrate that interim payments would be unrecoverable absent a stay, nor that the employer is experiencing financial difficulty in making payments.  Edwards v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation, 932 F.2d 1325, 1329 (9th Cir.1991).  \"Irreparable injury\" will be found only in extraordinary circumstances.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the minimal time delays required to effect proper service of process, see supra pt. I, a stay of section 921(d) enforcement proceedings while an employer pursues a modification ruling from the DOL (and, perhaps, pending appellate review) threatens a lengthy delay in the previously ordered compensation payments to the employee.  Therefore, under the \"inescapable inference\" standard established in Porter, 328 U.S. at 398, 66 S.Ct. at 1089, we must conclude that the LHWCA divests the district court of the equitable power to defer its entry of a section 921(d) enforcement order pending the outcome of a section 922 modification proceeding unless the employer first establishes \"irreparable injury.\"   As we have noted, Jones's answer did not allege facts sufficient to establish irreparable injury, nor does the record suggest a basis for such a showing.  Thus, the magistrate judge did not err in failing to act on the request for a temporary stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>III.

The case must be remanded to permit Williams to effect service of process upon Jones.  At such time as service of process is effected, Jones should be permitted to submit for district court consideration any order obtained in the LHWCA section 922 modification proceeding, failing which the district court may reinstate the section 921(d) enforcement order previously entered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The enforcement order is vacated and the case is remanded to permit service of process and for further proceedings in accordance herewith.

In contrast to LHWCA Sec. 921(d), however, the NLRB sections referenced in Rule 81(a)(5) contain detailed provisions relating to the filing of a petition to enforce an NLRB order.  See 29 U.S.C. Sec. 160(e) (\"Upon filing of such a petition, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon such person, and thereupon shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein, and shall have power to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper....\")  (emphasis added)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Although clearly treated by the parties and the district court as a Sec. 921(d) action, Williams's petition for enforcement is an odd hybrid.  Initially, Williams presented his petition for enforcement to the DOL.  In a June 30, 1992 letter to Williams, the District Director of the DOL determined that the compensation order was \"final,\" that it was made and administratively served \"in accordance with law,\" and that Jones was in default on payments.  Under Sec. 921(d), these administrative determinations were supererogatory.  Unlike Sec. 918(a), Sec. 921(d) expressly reserves such matters for resolution by the district court.  See 33 U.S.C. Sec. 921(d) (\"If the court determines that the order was made and served in accordance with law....\")  (emphasis added).  Although the district court correctly noted that Jones did not contest these matters (e.g., the giving of notice as required in the administrative proceedings under Sec. 919), the applicability of the Rule 4 service of process requirement is not made to depend, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(a)(6), upon whether the defendant-employer received notice in the administrative proceeding, but whether \"matters of procedure are provided for in\" the LHWCA, id.  (emphasis added).  Since there is no LHWCA provision governing service of process upon the defendant employer in a Sec. 921(d) judicial enforcement proceeding, the district court erred in determining that service of process in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 and 81(a)(6) was not necessary</p>\n        <p>Moreover, although the DOL letter of June 1992 contained findings analogous to those required under LHWCA Sec. 918(a), see supra note 5, it could not qualify as a Sec. 918 \"supplementary order,\" since (1) there is no record evidence that Jones contemporaneously received the letter, or any notice of it, (2) the DOL did not conduct a Sec. 919 hearing prior to issuance of the letter, (3) the copy of the DOL letter filed with the district court enforcement petition was not \"certified,\" and (4) Williams's district court petition specifically invokes subject matter jurisdiction under section 921(d) only.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Williams conceded that Jones was making payments at the time of the district court order, but insisted that the enforcement petition sought to compel payment of the \"arrearages\" dating from October 1978.  The magistrate judge concluded that Sec. 921(d) differed from Sec. 918(a), in that it permits the enforcement of prospective compensation orders only, compelling future payments to be made as they come due but not recoveries of past due payments.  Williams, slip op. at 3 (citing Henry v. Gentry Plumbing &amp; Heating Co., 704 F.2d 863 (5th Cir.1983)).

In Thompson, the Ninth Circuit broadly stated that a district court's role in a Sec. 921(d) proceeding is limited to screening for procedural defects in the DOL proceedings and that \"the district court has no jurisdiction over the merits of the litigation.\"   Thompson, 812 F.2d at 576 (emphasis added).  The Thompson court was not asked to consider the sufficiency of service of process in the district court proceeding</p>\n        <p>In support of its position, the Ninth Circuit cited Marshall, which looked to recent legislative history for guidance.  Prior to 1972, the district court had served both as an appellate court, reviewing the ALJ's compensation orders, and as the forum in which the employee could seek enforcement of a final compensation order.  In 1972, Congress established the BRB, which assumed the appellate role previously performed by the district court.  See H.R.Rep. 1441, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4709.  The Marshall court concluded that Congress intended, by its LHWCA amendments in 1972, to withdraw district court jurisdiction to consider any issue relating to the underlying merits of compensation orders.

In Marshall, the employer attempted to litigate core factual issues (e.g., LHWCA coverage and statute of limitations) for the first time in a Sec. 921(d) proceeding, having failed to raise them before the ALJ, or to appeal the compensation order to the BRB.  Id. at 937.   The Marshall court correctly relied on the fact that, by its amendments to the LHWCA in 1972, Congress unequivocally divested the district court of all appellate functions relating to ALJ compensation orders.  But Marshall did not involve the more difficult problems posed by newly discovered evidence of fraud.  Arguably, at least, successful invocation of an equitable defense to enforcement would not work an appellate affirmance, modification, or vacation of the underlying compensation order, but merely a refusal to deploy the equitable powers of the court in aid of a judgment fraudulently obtained.  Thus, Marshall's admonition that the district court's function is reduced to \"screening compensation orders for procedural defects\" does not purport to preclude exercise of the court's traditional discretionary power to grant or withhold equitable relief.

See supra pp. 252-53.  Section 921(d)'s language--\"shall enforce\"--does not call for a blanket preemption of the district court's traditional equitable powers.  See, e.g., Hecht, 321 U.S. at 329, 64 S.Ct. at 591 (holding that the phrase \" 'shall be granted' [in the injunctive enforcement provision of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942] is less mandatory than a literal reading might suggest\";  \"[w]e cannot but think that if Congress had intended to make such a drastic departure from the traditions of equity practice, an unequivocal statement of its purpose would have been made\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Section 922 may be invoked before or after a compensation award is entered.

Although Sec. 922 is subject to a one-year limitations period, a defaulting employer may restart the tolling period at any time by making a single compensation payment.  See 33 U.S.C. Sec. 922 (modification award can be filed \"at any time prior to one year after date of last payment of compensation\").

Section 918(a) enforcement proceedings normally are used to enforce compensation awards which have become \"effective\" but are not yet \"final\";  that is, during the pendency of an appeal to the BRB from the ALJ's initial award, or from the BRB to the court of appeals.  See supra notes 2 and 3.  Within one year after an employer's default, the employee may apply to an ALJ for a \"supplementary order\" declaring the amount in default.  The ALJ may not issue the supplementary order except \"[a]fter investigation, [and] notice, and hearing.\"   Even then, however, the supplementary order is not self-executing.  Rather, the claimant, or the ALJ, must file a certified copy of the supplementary order with the appropriate federal district court, which \"shall upon filing of the copy enter judgment for the amount declared in default ... if such supplementary order is in accordance with law.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Jourdan court held that the obligatory language of section 918(a) evinced a clear congressional intent to dispense with the \"service of process\" requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 in a section 918(a) enforcement proceeding brought in the district court.  The magistrate judge in the present case, analogizing from Jourdan, reasoned that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>[l]ike Section 918(a), Section 921(d) utilizes imperative language;  upon certain findings the court \"shall enforce.\"   The only difference is the lack of specificity regarding the method for filing the \"application.\"   In either case, the court must make preliminary findings that amount to nothing more than a procedural review of the underlying process.   Assuming there were no procedural errors at the administrative level, the court has no choice but to enforce the order.  Again, the court has no jurisdiction over the merits of the action.  The aggrieved party would have no additional opportunity to be heard even if notice were provided according to the strict requirements of Rule 4.   The logical conclusion is that Section 921(d) is a summary proceeding, and that upon filing of appropriate documentation showing that the order is final, that it was properly served, and that the employer has failed to comply, the court should issue the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Williams v.

Section 918(a)'s bifurcated enforcement mechanism requires administrative notice to the employer, as well as an opportunity to be heard, prior to the entry of any supplementary enforcement order by the ALJ.  See supra notes 2 and 5.  Long before the employee ever files the ALJ's certified supplementary order with the district court, therefore, the procedural requirements of section 918(a) itself have assured that the employer was placed on notice of the impending judicial enforcement proceeding.  The district court is expressly charged with determining whether \"such supplementary order [was] in accordance with law.\"  33 U.S.C. Sec. 918(a).  Thus, section 918(a) envisions an ancillary district court mechanism for enforcing supplementary enforcement orders entered by the ALJ.  Arguably, at least, this is the sort of administrative alternative to service of process which would preempt the Rule 4 service of process requirement under Fed.Rule Civ.P. 81(a)(6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In contrast, however, no notice to the employer is required prior to the commencement of a section 921(d) enforcement action in the district court.  See supra p. 251.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, we detect no intimation, either in the statutory language or legislative history, that Congress contemplated a section 921(d) proceeding quite so summary as indicated in the recommended decision.  Even assuming that a full panoply of equitable defenses is not available to an employer in a section 921(d) enforcement action, see infra pt. II, it is nonetheless clear that the employer may contest factual allegations upon which the section 921(d) enforcement petition necessarily depends,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> including the main issue whether the employer is in default.   Moreover, arguably at least, the employer might be entitled to raise factual challenges relating to (1) the amount in default,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> (2) whether new evidence indicates that the initial compensation order was procedurally defective, or otherwise not \"in accordance with law,\" or (3) employee conduct that might tilt the fundamental balance of equities in favor of judicial restraint.  See infra note 18.  Moreover, unlike the bifurcated process involved in a section 918(a) enforcement proceeding, which presumes prior notice and hearing at the administrative level, section 921(d) constitutes the district court the employer's first and only forum for a full hearing of such factual disputes prior to the issuance of an injunctive enforcement order, with its attendant exposure to coercive contempt proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The recommended decision observes that even without a formal Rule 4 service of process requirement the district court could notify an employer informally in those cases where the court believed that an employee's petition for enforcement involved controverted factual matters.  But of course such an approach could afford adequate safeguards only if the factual conflicts were apparent on the face of the employee's petition for enforcement.  Otherwise, there could be no assurance that the respondent-employer would have either notice or opportunity to assert a challenge.  Thus, to construe Rule 81(a)(6) as excepting section 921(d) enforcement actions from the service of process requirements of Rule 4, merely because the employer did not interpose opposition to the enforcement petition, could expose employers to ex parte enforcement orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Williams suggests that requiring service of process in a section 921(d) enforcement proceeding could subvert the LHWCA goal of ensuring prompt compliance with compensation orders.  Granting the premise of Williams's LHWCA policy argument in principle, whatever slight delay might be occasioned by requiring proper service of process in order to enable the court to obtain in personam jurisdiction over employers hardly seems inappropriate, especially in light of the simplicity of the procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sections 918(a) and 921(d) serve distinct roles in the LHWCA remedial scheme.  Section 918(a) designedly affords injured employees a convenient, inexpensive, and expeditious mechanism for facilitating enforcement of \"effective\" compensation awards even before they have become \"final \".  Congress anticipated the severe financial hardships that could beset injured employees as a result of lengthy appeals.  It therefore settled on the section 918(a) enforcement action as a simple means to compel prompt employer compliance with an enforcement award even though it might later be set aside on review.  See, e.g., Tidelands Marine Serv. v. Patterson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"426003\"><a href=\"/opinion/426003/tidelands-marine-service-and-highlands-insurance-company-v-leroy-patterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">719</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span>, 129 (5th Cir.1983) (Sec. 918(a) implements \"a theme central to the spirit, intent, and purposes of the LHWCA\");  Henry, 704 F.2d at 865.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  For some reason not disclosed in the appellate record, however, Williams failed to invoke the convenient, prompt, and inexpensive enforcement mechanism established under section 918(a) throughout the ten-year period spanned by Jones's numerous appeals.

Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"241929\"><a href=\"/opinion/241929/oliver-cassell-v-earl-c-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span>, 260 (D.C.Cir.1957) (one-year statute of limitations under Sec. 918(a) bars recovery on supplemental order filed sixteen years after default on compensation award payments);  supra note 5.  Moreover, Williams chose not to cross-appeal from the district court's ruling that section 921(d) could not be used to recover past-due payments.  See supra note 8.  The avoidable and unexplained delay in Williams's efforts to recover these past-due compensation payments from Jones, however ill advised or unfortunate, does not permit disregard of the service of process requirements applicable to section 921(d) enforcement proceedings, particularly since compliance will entail no significant further delay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  But cf. infra pt.

At the October 23, 1992 hearing before the magistrate judge, Jones proffered three affidavits from individuals who had accompanied Williams on numerous clamming and lobstering expeditions between October 1978 and March 1981.  These affidavits attest that Williams engaged in the very types of heavy labor and lifting explicitly disclaimed in his testimony before the ALJ in 1980.  Jones contends that the identity of the affiants could not have been discovered earlier in the exercise of reasonable diligence, since Jones only learned of their existence through a \"chance conversation\" in August or September of 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the affirmative defenses, Jones requested alternative forms of equitable relief:  (1) denial of the enforcement order on the ground that a party who obtains a compensation award through fraud is not entitled to its enforcement by injunction, or (2) a temporary stay of the section 921(d) enforcement action pending administrative relief from the DOL.  With respect to the state-law counterclaim, see Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 14, Sec. 870 (1992) (damages action for perjury), Jones requested compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that it had no \"jurisdiction\"--hence no discretion under LHWCA section 921(d)--to refuse to enforce the compensation order, except on the two grounds enumerated in the LHWCA, neither of which was contested by Jones;  namely, that Jones was not in default or that the compensation order was not made and served \"in accordance with law.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  On related grounds, the district court refused to exercise pendent jurisdiction over Jones's state-law counterclaim.

See Restatement (Second) of Judgments Sec. 70, cmt. a (1982) (a court of equity will not enforce a judgment obtained by fraud).

In contrast to LHWCA Sec. 921(d), however, the NLRB sections referenced in Rule 81(a)(5) contain detailed provisions relating to the filing of a petition to enforce an NLRB order.  See 29 U.S.C. Sec. 160(e) (\"Upon filing of such a petition, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon such person, and thereupon shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein, and shall have power to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper....\")  (emphasis added)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Although clearly treated by the parties and the district court as a Sec. 921(d) action, Williams's petition for enforcement is an odd hybrid.  Initially, Williams presented his petition for enforcement to the DOL.  In a June 30, 1992 letter to Williams, the District Director of the DOL determined that the compensation order was \"final,\" that it was made and administratively served \"in accordance with law,\" and that Jones was in default on payments.  Under Sec. 921(d), these administrative determinations were supererogatory.  Unlike Sec. 918(a), Sec. 921(d) expressly reserves such matters for resolution by the district court.  See 33 U.S.C. Sec. 921(d) (\"If the court determines that the order was made and served in accordance with law....\")  (emphasis added).  Although the district court correctly noted that Jones did not contest these matters (e.g., the giving of notice as required in the administrative proceedings under Sec. 919), the applicability of the Rule 4 service of process requirement is not made to depend, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(a)(6), upon whether the defendant-employer received notice in the administrative proceeding, but whether \"matters of procedure are provided for in\" the LHWCA, id.  (emphasis added).  Since there is no LHWCA provision governing service of process upon the defendant employer in a Sec. 921(d) judicial enforcement proceeding, the district court erred in determining that service of process in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 and 81(a)(6) was not necessary</p>\n        <p>Moreover, although the DOL letter of June 1992 contained findings analogous to those required under LHWCA Sec. 918(a), see supra note 5, it could not qualify as a Sec. 918 \"supplementary order,\" since (1) there is no record evidence that Jones contemporaneously received the letter, or any notice of it, (2) the DOL did not conduct a Sec. 919 hearing prior to issuance of the letter, (3) the copy of the DOL letter filed with the district court enforcement petition was not \"certified,\" and (4) Williams's district court petition specifically invokes subject matter jurisdiction under section 921(d) only.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Williams conceded that Jones was making payments at the time of the district court order, but insisted that the enforcement petition sought to compel payment of the \"arrearages\" dating from October 1978.  The magistrate judge concluded that Sec. 921(d) differed from Sec. 918(a), in that it permits the enforcement of prospective compensation orders only, compelling future payments to be made as they come due but not recoveries of past due payments.

The Thompson court was not asked to consider the sufficiency of service of process in the district court proceeding</p>\n        <p>In support of its position, the Ninth Circuit cited Marshall, which looked to recent legislative history for guidance.  Prior to 1972, the district court had served both as an appellate court, reviewing the ALJ's compensation orders, and as the forum in which the employee could seek enforcement of a final compensation order.  In 1972, Congress established the BRB, which assumed the appellate role previously performed by the district court.  See H.R.Rep. 1441, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4709.

In Marshall, the employer attempted to litigate core factual issues (e.g., LHWCA coverage and statute of limitations) for the first time in a Sec. 921(d) proceeding, having failed to raise them before the ALJ, or to appeal the compensation order to the BRB.  Id. at 937.   The Marshall court correctly relied on the fact that, by its amendments to the LHWCA in 1972, Congress unequivocally divested the district court of all appellate functions relating to ALJ compensation orders.  But Marshall did not involve the more difficult problems posed by newly discovered evidence of fraud.  Arguably, at least, successful invocation of an equitable defense to enforcement would not work an appellate affirmance, modification, or vacation of the underlying compensation order, but merely a refusal to deploy the equitable powers of the court in aid of a judgment fraudulently obtained.  Thus, Marshall's admonition that the district court's function is reduced to \"screening compensation orders for procedural defects\" does not purport to preclude exercise of the court's traditional discretionary power to grant or withhold equitable relief.

See, e.g., Hecht, 321 U.S. at 329, 64 S.Ct. at 591 (holding that the phrase \" 'shall be granted' [in the injunctive enforcement provision of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942] is less mandatory than a literal reading might suggest\";  \"[w]e cannot but think that if Congress had intended to make such a drastic departure from the traditions of equity practice, an unequivocal statement of its purpose would have been made\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Section 922 may be invoked before or after a compensation award is entered.

Sec. 922 (modification award can be filed \"at any time prior to one year after date of last payment of compensation\").

It is possible, even likely, that Jones's Sec. 922 petition will have been acted upon by the DOL before Jones has been served with process pursuant to Civil Rule 4 following remand to the district court.
