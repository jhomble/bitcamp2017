GIBSON, Circuit Judge.          Randolph Mills pleaded\n\nguilty to one count of illegal reentry of a removed alien, in\n\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326.          The presentence report computed a\n\ntotal offense level of seventeen and a criminal history category of\n\nI.   The resulting guideline imprisonment range was twenty-four to\n\nthirty months.    The district court sentenced Mills to two years'\n\nprobation and a $100 special assessment.               The government now\n\nappeals.    We vacate Mills's sentence and remand for resentencing.\n\n            Randolph Mills was born in Kingston, Jamaica. He entered\n\nthe United States legally and became a lawful permanent resident,\n\nbut the State of Connecticut sentenced him to a five year term of\n\nimprisonment following a conviction on drug charges.                The State\n\nsuspended    Mills's   term    of    imprisonment   after   one   year.   The\n\ngovernment    placed   Mills    in    removal   proceedings   following   his\n\nrelease and deported him to Jamaica on January 9, 1999.               On July\n\n29, 2004, Mills was arrested in Greenfield, Massachusetts, for\n\nfirearm and drug offenses under the name of \"Dashe Andre Beckford.\"\n\nThe State released Mills on bail but he failed to appear for\n\nsubsequent court appearances, and the State issued a warrant for\n\nhis arrest.    The State arrested Mills per the warrant on March 2,\n\n2005, and determined that he was the same individual who had been\n\ndeported in 1999.      After his arrest on March 2, the State retained\n\ncustody of Mills.\n\n            On April 14, 2005, the government charged Mills with\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fillegal reentry of a removed alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326.\n\nMills made an initial appearance before the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts on May 6, 2005, pursuant to\n\na writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum.              The presiding magistrate\n\njudge granted the government's motion for detention.                         Federal\n\nauthorities, however, did not detain Mills at that time, but\n\ninstead    returned     him    to   state   custody   pursuant    to    the    state\n\ncharges.      Mills pleaded guilty to the federal offense on May 11,\n\n2006, and the district court sentenced him to probation on August\n\n16, 2006.       During the sentencing hearing, the district court\n\nexpressed particular concern with the amount of time Mills had\n\nspent in custody and the possibility of Mills receiving credit for\n\nthat time.       The district court noted that Mills had been in\n\ndetention for the seventeen months following his arrest on March 2,\n\n2005.      The government objected that the seventeen months was\n\nirrelevant because it was on unrelated state charges. The district\n\ncourt then decided to sentence Mills to probation instead of time\n\nserved so as to avoid \"getting into whether time served is an\n\nappropriate sentence or not.\"\n\n              On September 28, 2006, Mills pleaded guilty to the state\n\ndrug    and    weapon    charges      and     was   sentenced    to    365    days'\n\nimprisonment.     He received a credit of 365 days for time served and\n\nimmediately      entered      the   custody    of   Immigration       and    Customs\n\nEnforcement where he currently remains. The government now appeals\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthe sentence given by the district court.\n\n           We review the district court's sentence under the now\n\nadvisory guidelines for reasonableness.   Rita v. United States, __\n\nU.S. __, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 2459 (2007); United States v. Booker, 543\n\nU.S. 220, 260-63 (2005).   The government argues that the district\n\ncourt erred in concluding that the State of Massachusetts was\n\nholding Mills pursuant to the federal charges. We review for clear\n\nerror a district court's factual findings relevant to a sentencing\n\ncalculation.   United States v. Goodhue, 486 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).   \"[A] sentence will be vacated as unreasonable under Booker\n\nif it is predicated on a clearly erroneous view of material facts.\"\n\nUnited States v. Robinson, 433 F.3d 31, 38 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           In this case, it is apparent that the district court's\n\ndecision to sentence Mills to probation was predicated on an\n\nerroneous finding that Mills had been imprisoned on federal charges\n\nwhile in state custody before trial.      Examining the sentencing\n\ntranscript and the statement of reasons, we observe that the\n\ndistrict court was under the impression that Mills was in custody\n\non the basis of the federal charge, illegal reentry of a removed\n\nalien.   First, Mills's counsel notified the district court during\n\nthe sentencing hearing that Mills had been held on the order of\n\ndetention since May 6, 2005.    The district court then responded\n\nwith concern that Mills \"has been in jail for fifteen months.\"\n\nLater, the district court concluded that probation was appropriate\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fbecause Mills had \"served enough on the charge before me\" (emphasis\n\nadded).     The district court then emphasized that everyone should\n\n\"understand the reason\" for the sentence imposed, namely that \"I\n\nthink he has served enough time on this charge\" (emphasis added).\n\nFinally, in its statement of reasons, the district court explained\n\nthat it was sentencing Mills outside the advisory guideline system\n\nbecause Mills had \"already served enough time in prison on these\n\ncharges, but in state custody\" (emphasis added).\n\n            Contrary to the district court's assertions, however, it\n\nis evident that the presentence report, to which neither party\n\nobjected, plainly states that Mills was being held pursuant to\n\nunrelated state charges.     The district court, moreover, gave no\n\nindication why it was disregarding the presentence report.    While\n\nMills did appear before the district court on several occasions,\n\nthose appearances did not change his custody status. See Sinito v.\n\nKindt, 954 F.2d 467, 470 (7th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (holding that\n\n\"[t]he issuance of the writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum did\n\nnot alter [the prisoner's] custody status\").   Since credit for 365\n\ndays that Mills was in state custody was properly applied to the\n\neventual guilty plea on separate state charges, Mills is not\n\nentitled to have that time also credited towards his federal\n\nsentence.    See United States v. Wilson, 503 U.S. 329, 334 (1992);\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3585(b)(2).\n\n            Mills argues that because the government obtained a\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fdetainer against Mills while he was in state custody, the time\n\nserved should apply to the federal sentence.1          This argument is\n\nunpersuasive.    It is well-established that when a federal detainer\n\nis irrelevant to custody in relation to a state offense, credit is\n\nnot available.    See Bloomgren v. Belaski, 948 F.2d 688, 690 (10th\n\nCir. 1991) (noting that when a federal detainer is unrelated to a\n\nstate prisoner's continued custody, credit is not available for the\n\nfederal   sentence).    In   this   case,   Mills   offers   no   argument\n\ncontradicting the presentence report's statement regarding the\n\nreason for Mills's state custody. We have no reason, therefore, to\n\nconclude that the federal detainer was the sole reason for Mills's\n\ncontinuing custody.\n\n           Finally, we have some concern regarding the district\n\ncourt's decision to sentence Mills to probation in consideration of\n\nhis seventeen month detention with state authorities.        The Supreme\n\nCourt has plainly stated that 18 U.S.C. § 3585(b)(2) \"does not\n\nauthorize a district court to compute the credit at sentencing.\"\n\nWilson, 503 U.S. at 334. The district court, therefore, should not\n\nhave taken into account Mills's custody in its sentencing decision,\n\n\n\n     1\n      Mills cites the Supreme Court's decision in Reno v. Koray,\n515 U.S. 50 (1995), in his argument that the federal detainer\nqualifies him for credit towards his sentence. Mills's reliance is\nmisplaced. The Court in Koray held that time spent in a community\ntreatment center did not qualify as official detention for\ncrediting purposes. The decision does not address whether time\nspent in detention on state charges can also qualify a prisoner for\ncredit on federal charges.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fbut   should    have    instead   left    the    determination       of   Mills's\n\neligibility for credit for time served to the Attorney General and\n\nthe   Bureau   of    Prisons.      The    fact   that    the    district    court\n\ntechnically refrained from sentencing Mills to \"time served\" is\n\ninsufficient to cure the district court's error under Wilson.\n\n            We conclude that the district court's consideration of\n\nMills's    custody     on   unrelated    state   charges       at   the   time   of\n\nsentencing     was   clearly    erroneous.2      We     therefore    vacate      the\n\nsentence imposed and remand for resentencing consistent with this\n\nopinion.     In light of our holding, Mills's pending motions are\n\ndenied.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      Because we determine that Mills's sentence must be remanded\ndue to the district court's consideration of an erroneous factual\nconclusion, we express no opinion as to the government's argument\nthat a sentence of two years of probation would be substantively\nunreasonable on the facts of this case.\n\n                                        -7-\n\f",

The district court, therefore, should not\n\nhave taken into account Mills's custody in its sentencing decision,\n\n\n\n     1\n      Mills cites the Supreme Court's decision in Reno v. Koray,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117943\"><a href=\"/opinion/117943/reno-v-koray/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995), in his argument that the federal detainer\nqualifies him for credit towards his sentence. Mills's reliance is\nmisplaced. The Court in Koray held that time spent in a community\ntreatment center did not qualify as official detention for\ncrediting purposes. The decision does not address whether time\nspent in detention on state charges can also qualify a prisoner for\ncredit on federal charges.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fbut   should    have    instead   left    the    determination       of   Mills's\n\neligibility for credit for time served to the Attorney General and\n\nthe   Bureau   of    Prisons.      The    fact   that    the    district    court\n\ntechnically refrained from sentencing Mills to \"time served\" is\n\ninsufficient to cure the district court's error under Wilson.\n\n            We conclude that the district court's consideration of\n\nMills's    custody     on   unrelated    state   charges       at   the   time   of\n\nsentencing     was   clearly    erroneous.2      We     therefore    vacate      the\n\nsentence imposed and remand for resentencing consistent with this\n\nopinion.     In light of our holding, Mills's pending motions are\n\ndenied.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      Because we determine that Mills's sentence must be remanded\ndue to the district court's consideration of an erroneous factual\nconclusion, we express no opinion as to the government's argument\nthat a sentence of two years of probation would be substantively\nunreasonable on the facts of this case.\n\n                                        -7-\n\f</pre>",
