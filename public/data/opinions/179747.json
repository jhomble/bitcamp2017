These three consolidated appeals\n\narise out of the improper use of a model's image to package and\n\npromote a home entertainment system.          The model, plaintiff Ting Ji\n\n(Ji), although successful at trial as to liability, insists that a\n\nnew trial as to damages is necessary to cure the district court's\n\npurported errors in refusing to compel discovery and instructing\n\nthe jury.    The maker of the entertainment system, defendant Bose\n\nCorporation (Bose), and Ji's photographer, defendant White/Packert,\n\nInc. (White), contest other rulings of the district court in their\n\nrespective cross-appeals.\n\n            After careful review, we affirm in all respects.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            In 2004, Ji participated in a photo shoot for which she\n\nwas paid $1,000.      On the same day, she signed two documents in\n\nconnection with the shoot.        The first was her modeling agency's\n\nvoucher (Voucher) that confirmed her attendance at the shoot and\n\nentitled her to payment.      The Voucher included a release assigning\n\nlimited   use   of   Ji's   photos;   among   other   things,   the   release\n\nprohibited the use of images for \"packages, point of purchase,\n\n[and] displays.\"     The second instrument that Ji signed was White's\n\nadult release (Release), which included a broad release that\n\nassigned the \"absolute right and permission to . . . use\" Ji's\n\nimages \"for any purpose whatsoever.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f                 Thinking that it had secured a \"total buy-out\" of Ji's\n\nimages based on the Release, White conveyed the images to Bose.\n\nBose selected one of those images for the packaging of its 3·2·1®\n\nSeries II DVD Home Entertainment System (the 321 System) and\n\nrelated promotional media.          The image Bose selected featured the\n\n321 System with Ji partially embracing a male model as they watched\n\ntelevision from a couch.           The photo was taken from behind the\n\ncouch, exposing the back of Ji's head and little of her face; as a\n\nresult, Ji is barely recognizable.             Bose placed the image on the\n\nupper right-hand corner of each side of the 321 System's packaging.\n\n                 After Ji discovered her image while perusing a Best Buy\n\nstore, she sued Bose in federal district court in Florida.                  She\n\nasserted a false endorsement claim under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act,\n\n15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), a right-to-publicity claim under Florida\n\nStatutes § 540.08, and a common-law claim for invasion of privacy.\n\nBose successfully moved to transfer the case to federal district\n\ncourt       in   Massachusetts,   where   it   is   based.   Ji   amended   her\n\ncomplaint to assert an additional claim for unfair trade practices\n\nunder Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.1                She also added White as a\n\ndefendant.        Bose then filed cross-claims against White for breach\n\nof contract, misrepresentation, indemnification, and contribution.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      The district court issued a posttrial order finding no\nviolation of Chapter 93A as to either Bose or White. Ji has not\nappealed that ruling.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f          During discovery, Ji sought financial information from\n\nBose, including sales data concerning its 321 System, on the ground\n\nthat she needed that information to prove damages under the Lanham\n\nAct.   Bose objected because, as a private company, its financial\n\ninformation, and particularly information concerning its sales, was\n\nsensitive and closely guarded.       Bose also argued that discovery\n\nconcerning such information should await the district court's\n\nruling on Bose's pending and potentially dispositive motion for\n\npartial summary judgment on Ji's Lanham Act claim.         The district\n\ncourt agreed and postponed discovery.\n\n          The   court   eventually   granted   Bose's   partial   summary\n\njudgment motion and dismissed Ji's Lanham Act claim.              Of the\n\nfactors that courts have found necessary to prove false endorsement\n\nunder the Lanham Act, the district court concluded that Ji could at\n\nbest prove two and that six leaned decidedly in Bose's favor.         See\n\nDowning v. Abercrombie & Fitch, 265 F.3d 994, 1007-08 (9th Cir.\n\n2001) (listing factors in false endorsement case).          Of critical\n\nimportance to the district court, Ji did not show, nor could the\n\ncourt credibly infer, that her identity (or \"mark,\" in trademark\n\nparlance) was familiar to Bose's target audience.\n\n          Despite this setback, and the specter that her extant\n\ndiscovery requests would be fruitless, Ji again moved to compel\n\nproduction of Bose's financial information.        This time Ji argued\n\nthat she still needed that information in order to prove damages on\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fher right-to-publicity claim because Florida law entitled her, if\n\nsuccessful, to a \"reasonable royalty.\"   Fla. Stat. § 540.08.    The\n\ndistrict court initially denied the motion. On further reflection,\n\nhowever, the court granted it in part and ordered Bose to produce\n\ninformation \"sufficient for [Ji] to inform the jury of the extent\n\nof [Bose's] use\" of her image:\n\n          This Court has previously ruled that the \"reasonable\n     royalty\" language in Fla. Stat. § 540.08 provides for\n     recovery of compensatory damages which does not implicate\n     the net worth of the defendant.        Nevertheless, the\n     plaintiff   may   reasonably    argue   that   her   fair\n     compensation, should she prove a violation of the\n     statute, ought to depend, to some degree, upon Bose's\n     usage of her image.\n\n          Bose will, therefore, produce to Ji . . .\n     information sufficient for her to inform the jury of the\n     extent of its use of the subject photographs.        Such\n     information includes, to the extent that it is available,\n     1) the number of unit boxes on which her image appeared,\n     2) the number of point-of-purchase displays that were\n     produced in the years in which her image was in use and\n     3) the number of promotional CD-ROMs that were\n     distributed in the advertisement of the [321 System].\n     Bose will not be required to produce sales figures with\n     respect to its [321 System] unless no other metric, such\n     as those indicated in the preceding sentence, is\n     ascertainable.\n\n          After the close of discovery, Bose and White moved for\n\nsummary judgment on Ji's Florida claims.    They asserted, and Ji\n\nagreed, that her Florida claims \"hinged on\" a question of contract\n\ninterpretation:   whether the Voucher or the Release controlled\n\nBose's rights with respect to the images of Ji taken by White.\n\nBose and White argued that the Release controlled because the\n\nVoucher left essential terms blank and was therefore unenforceable.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fJi countered that the absence of some terms in the Voucher did not\n\ninvalidate it.   According to Ji, the Voucher controlled because it\n\nwas executed earlier in time.    At the very least, Ji argued, the\n\nquestion was more appropriate for the jury because it involved\n\ncompeting accounts of the parties' intentions.        Viewing both\n\ncontracts together, the district court concluded that it was\n\nunclear from the plain language which controlled the dispute.\n\nBecause the parties submitted conflicting extrinsic evidence, and\n\nhad retained expert witnesses in part to opine on this precise\n\nquestion, the district court denied summary judgment.\n\n          The case proceeded to trial. After four days of argument\n\nand testimony, the jury found that Bose violated Ji's publicity and\n\nprivacy rights under Florida law but awarded her only $10,000 (a\n\nfraction of her $2 million demand).2      The jury also found that\n\nWhite was liable to Bose for the award.\n\n\n     2\n      The first question on the verdict form asked the jury whether\nBose violated Ji's publicity or privacy rights under Florida law\nand required a yes-or-no answer.     The jury foreman checked the\n\"yes\" box. The second question asked the jury to enter an amount\nof damages proved as a result of Bose's violation of Ji's right to\npublicity or its invasion of her privacy or both. The jury foreman\nwrote \"$10,000.\"\n     Based on the verdict form's use of the disjunctive, it is\npossible that the jury determined that there was no violation of\nFla. Stat. § 540.08, and awarded damages on Ji's common-law privacy\nclaim only. Whether this possibility impacts our review of the\nmeasure of damages available under § 540.08 is an issue that the\nparties do not address. Because the parties agreed below that both\nclaims turned on the same question (whether Ji consented to the use\nof her images), and because we will never know the exact basis of\nthe jury's determination, we proceed to address the parties'\ndispute anyway.\n\n                                -7-\n\f            After judgment entered, Bose moved for attorneys' fees on\n\nJi's    unsuccessful   false   endorsement   claim   under   an   express\n\nprovision in the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a) (\"[t]he Court in\n\nexceptional cases may award reasonable attorneys' fees to the\n\nprevailing party\"), and as a sanction for \"vexatious\" litigation\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1927 (providing for attorneys' fees in cases\n\nwhere an attorney \"unreasonably and vexatiously . . . multiples the\n\nproceedings in any case\"). The district court denied the motion on\n\nthe ground that Ji's false endorsement claim, while meritless,\n\nfailed to satisfy the high standards under either statute for the\n\nimposition of attorneys' fees.\n\n            All parties appealed.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n\n            These appeals raise three main issues.\n\n       A.   Measure of Damages under Florida Statutes § 540.08\n\n            Ji's principal grievance is that the district court\n\nfundamentally misunderstood the measure of damages under § 540.08\n\nas compensatory rather than royalty based. Had the court correctly\n\nunderstood the law, Ji argues, it should have compelled Bose to\n\nproduce sales data (number of units sold, revenues, profits),\n\nrather than mere usage data (number of units on which Ji's image\n\nappeared).   Ji contends that without sales data the jury could not\n\ncalculate a percentage of sales, and therefore could not determine\n\na reasonable royalty.    Ji also argues that the court's omission of\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fher proposed royalty-based damages instruction was erroneous. Even\n\nif the jury had the benefit of sales data, Ji postulates, it still\n\ncould not have determined a reasonable royalty because the court's\n\ncharge restricted any award to compensatory damages.   According to\n\nJi, these errors require a new trial on damages.3\n\n          We disagree.   In doing so, we need not prophesy whether\n\nthe Florida Supreme Court would characterize damages under § 540.08\n\nas compensatory or something else.    Instead, we take each of Ji's\n\ntwo arguments on their own terms and reject them.\n\n          1.      Motion to Compel\n\n          \"Discovery orders ordinarily are reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\"   Cusumano v. Microsoft Corp., 162 F.3d 708, 713 (1st\n\nCir. 1998). This standard is \"not appellant-friendly,\" and we will\n\nnot intervene without a \"clear showing of manifest injustice, that\n\nis, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and\n\nresulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\"     Dennis\n\nv. Osram Sylvania, Inc., 549 F.3d 851, 860 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting\n\nModern Cont'l/Obayashi v. Occupational Safety & Health Review\n\nComm'n, 196 F.3d 274, 281 (1st Cir. 1999)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).   \"A decision may be plainly wrong if it is based on\n\nan incorrect legal standard or a misapplication of the law.\"    In re\n\nSubpoena to Witzel, 531 F.3d 113, 117 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n\n\n     3\n      Notably, Ji does not argue on appeal that the jury's $10,000\ndamages award was unsupported by the evidence.\n\n                                -9-\n\f            Section 540.08 of the Florida Statutes provides:\n\n     The person whose likeness is used . . . may bring an\n     action to enjoin such unauthorized publication, printing,\n     display or other public use, and to recover damages for\n     any loss of injury sustained by reason thereof, including\n     an amount which would have been a reasonable royalty, and\n     punitive or exemplary damages.\n\nFla. Stat. § 540.08(2).        The statute does not define a reasonable\n\nroyalty, or suggest what data is necessary to calculate what one\n\nmight be in any particular set of facts.           No opinion of the Florida\n\nSupreme Court, or of Florida's lower appellate courts, does either.\n\n            Ji's argument that sales data are necessary to determine\n\ndamages under § 540.08 is based on (1) an unpublished decision of\n\na Florida federal district court, Jackson v. Grupo Indus. Hotelero,\n\nSA, No. 07-22046, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116770 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 29,\n\n2009),4 and (2) an analogy to patent law.                Neither shows that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion when it ordered Bose to\n\nproduce usage data in lieu of sales data.\n\n            In Jackson, following a bench trial, the district court\n\nfound    that   the    Coco   Bongo    nightclub     violated     §   540.08   by\n\nmisappropriating the likeness of well-known entertainer Curtis\n\nJackson   (a/k/a      \"50   Cent\")    and   his   mark    \"G-Unit\"    (short   for\n\n\"Guerilla Unit,\" the nom de guerre of Jackson's hip-hop group).\n\nId. at *25.     As for damages under the statute, the district court\n\n\n\n     4\n      Of course, decisions of federal trial courts interpreting\nstate law are not binding on state courts (or on federal appellate\ncourts attempting to divine how a state court might rule).\n\n                                       -10-\n\fobserved that the \"reasonable royalty measure of damages is taken\n\nto mean more than simply a percentage of actual profits.                      The\n\nmeasure now, very simply, means the actual value of what has been\n\nappropriated.\"         Id.    at    *30-31    (emphasis    supplied)    (quoting\n\nUniversity Computing Co. v. Lykes-Youngstown Corp., 504 F.2d 518,\n\n537 (5th Cir. 1974)).          To ascertain what that \"value\" was, the\n\ndistrict court turned to basic principles of Florida's law of\n\ndamages:    \"The fundamental principle of the law of damages is that\n\nthe person injured . . . shall have fair and just compensation\n\ncommensurate    with    the    loss    sustained    in    consequence    of   the\n\ndefendant's act which gives rise to the action.\"                Id. at *35-36\n\n(quoting MCI WorldCom Network Servs. v. Mastec, Inc., 995 So. 2d\n\n221, 224 (Fla. 2008)).             Framework in place, the district court\n\ndetermined that a lump-sum payment of $200,000 was a reasonable\n\nroyalty for Coco Bongo's misappropriation.               Id. at *36.\n\n            Ji argues that the district court's $200,000 award in\n\nJackson was \"based on $4,654,846 in sales -- a 4.3% royalty rate.\"\n\nNot true.    Nowhere in its analysis of damages under § 540.08 did\n\nthe district court mention, let alone consider, Coco Bongo's sales.\n\nSee id. at 35-42.            It only did so in calculating damages on\n\nJackson's successful Lanham Act claim.             Id. at 42 (\"[Jackson] is\n\nentitled to an award of profits for the infringing use of his\n\ntrademark only.   Compare 15 U.S.C. 1117, with Section 540.08, Fla.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fStat.\") (first emphasis supplied).           Here, unlike in Jackson, Ji's\n\nLanham Act claim was dismissed on summary judgment.\n\n            For    similar    reasons,    Ji's   reliance    on    the    court's\n\nstatement in Jackson, quoted above, that a reasonable royalty means\n\n\"more than simply a percentage of actual profits,\" is mistaken.\n\nId.   at   *30    (quoting   University   Computing,   504    F.2d       at   537).\n\n\"Judges expect their pronunciamentos to be read in context.\" In re\n\nOlympic Mills, 477 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Wisehart v.\n\nDavis, 408 F.3d 321, 326 (7th Cir. 2005)) (internal quotation marks\n\nand alternation omitted).       The fallacy in Ji's argument is readily\n\napparent.        If the court in Jackson meant that profits were a\n\ncomponent of a reasonable royalty, then why did it disregard Coco\n\nBongo's profits (which were in the record) when it determined\n\ndamages under § 540.08?        Ji offers no reasonable explanation for\n\nthis discrepancy.\n\n            Ji's analogy to patent law measures of damages suffers a\n\nsimilar,    but    much   quicker,   fate.       Whatever    the    variety      of\n\napproaches under patent law, see, e.g., University Computing, 504\n\nF.2d at 536-39, the language of the federal statute is different\n\nand there is no basis to assume that § 540.08 was meant to have the\n\nsame meaning.\n\n            All in all, it is enough that Ji has failed to submit\n\nreliable indicia that the Florida Supreme Court would consider\n\nsales data as necessary components of a reasonable royalty under §\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f540.08.      Accordingly,   the   district      court    did    not   abuse   its\n\ndiscretion in compelling Bose to produce usage data instead.\n\n            If we had any doubts about this conclusion (we do not),\n\nJi's failure to show prejudice resulting from the district court's\n\norder would remove them.       As discussed, the district court ordered\n\nBose to tell Ji the \"number of unit boxes on which her image\n\nappeared.\"      Bose   thereafter     told      Ji,     via    a   supplemental\n\ninterrogatory response, that Ji's image appeared on approximately\n\n206,000 units of the 321 System.           Based on that data point, and\n\nrecord evidence that the 321 System sold for $999 per unit, Ji's\n\nexpert    witness,   Richard    Wolfe,     an   attorney       specializing   in\n\nentertainment law, was able to extrapolate that Bose's gross\n\nrevenues from the 321 System were as high as about $206 million.\n\nApplying a rate of between a half percent and one percent of that\n\nfigure, Wolfe testified at trial that in his opinion a reasonable\n\n\"usage fee\" (which he equated with a \"royalty\") would be between $1\n\nmillion and $2 million.5       At closing, Ji's counsel, specifically\n\n\n     5\n      Because Ji hotly contests this point, we provide excerpts\nfrom Wolfe's trial testimony:\n\n     [Ji's Counsel:] [B]ased on your experience with these\n     different types of usages, can you describe for us the\n     different types of compensation that you have seen models\n     receive for these different usages?\n\n     [Wolfe:] Sure. And, again, it ranges the gamut, and it\n     also depends upon the stature of the model and it depends\n     upon the intended use by the ultimate user. . . . [W]here\n     the image is going to be used for a commercial purpose .\n     . . we're typically going to negotiate for a flat fee for\n\n                                    -13-\n\freferencing Wolfe's testimony, argued that the jury should award Ji\n\na $2 million fee based on a one-percent rate.6\n\n\n     the model's time to take the photos, and that we would\n     negotiate an ongoing fee, sometimes called a royalty,\n     which would be commensurate with the uses by the user of\n     the image. . . .\n\n     [Ji's Counsel:] [D]o you have an idea of the numerical\n     circulation of my client's picture by Bose?\n\n     [Wolfe:]   Yes.\n\n     [Ji's Counsel:]    And what is that understanding?\n\n     [Wolfe:]   That the picture was used on the product\n     approximately 206,000 times. . . .\n\n     [Ji's Counsel:] Based on your experience in negotiating\n     compensation packages for modeling agencies and their\n     models, do you have an opinion as to the compensation to\n     which a model whose image is used on $206 million worth\n     of merchandise might be entitled?\n\n     [Wolfe:]   I do.\n\n     [Ji's Counsel:]    What is that opinion? . . .\n\n     [Wolfe:] [B]ased on my experience, I would negotiate for\n     one-half of one percent to one percent, and if you take\n     206,000 uses at $999 at the low end of the scale, you're\n     at approximately $1 million is a reasonable utilization\n     and a reasonable compensation to the model at the low\n     end, and at the high end, I would say $2 million at the\n     one percent.\n\n(Emphasis supplied.)\n     6\n      For the same reason,     we   provide   an   excerpt   from   Ji's\ncounsel's closing argument:\n\n          Let me tell you how we believe that you [the jury]\n     should [determine damages]. We believe that you should\n     follow the testimony, which was unchallenged, by Mr.\n     Wolfe, who stated his experience with modeling agencies\n     and models, and he clearly told you that a reasonable fee\n\n                                -14-\n\f           Ji argues that although Wolfe was able to extrapolate\n\nmaximum potential revenues based on the number of units Bose\n\npackaged, he could not determine actual revenues without knowing\n\nhow many of those units Bose sold.       This is, of course, true.      But\n\nthis could not have prejudiced Ji.       The number of units Bose sold\n\nwould have to be equal to or, more likely, less than the number of\n\nunits   Bose    packaged.   Therefore,    the   usage   fee   Ji's   expert\n\nrecommended was the upper end of a range based on what actual\n\nrevenues could have been.    Actual revenues were probably less, but\n\nBose (perhaps against its interest) did not object and the jury was\n\nfree to agree with Wolfe.\n\n           2.       Jury Instructions\n\n           Ji proposed the following two instructions, and others,\n\nto the district court:\n\n          [Proposed Jury Instruction No. 22:] If you find for\n     the Plaintiff on her claims for violation of right to\n     publicity, you should award Plaintiff an amount of money\n     that the preponderance of the evidence shows will fairly\n\n\n     would be a usage fee, and I know it's large, but that is\n     based on $206 million worth of commercial boxes. He said\n     usage fees are the way that models like Ms. Ji are\n     compensated. . . . From Mr. Wolfe, he's basically looked\n     at the situation, and he said that a fee of one-half to\n     one percent, one-half to one percent of the unauthorized\n     use of her image on $206 million worth of merchandise\n     would be a fair and reasonable fee.         She's not a\n     celebrity, she's not a top model, but Mr. Wolfe said that\n     someone in a like situation, someone who used -- they\n     used their image in unauthorized ways, a reasonable usage\n     fee would be between $1 million and $2 million.\n\n(Emphasis supplied.)\n\n                                 -15-\n\f      and adequately compensate Plaintiff for the damages she\n      has sustained by virtue of Bose's appropriation and\n      exploitation of Plaintiff's image without her express\n      consent. If you find that the Plaintiff has been injured\n      by Bose in violation of her rights under Florida Statute\n      § 540.08, she is entitled to receive damages from Bose\n      which may include a reasonable royalty.\n\n           [Proposed Jury Instruction No. 23:] A \"royalty\" can\n      be established several different ways.    One method of\n      establishing a royalty is by the total amount of the\n      [sic] Bose's profits resulting from its exploitation of\n      Plaintiff's image.\n\n           At the charge conference, the district court stated that\n\nit would deliver the substance of proposed instruction 22 but not\n\n23:\n\n      I will give the substance of 22.        However, Bose's\n      objections have been noted, and the instructions will\n      certainly be consistent with this Court's prior rulings.\n      On No. 23, I am not going to give that. We'll tell the\n      jury about what compensatory damages are but not how to\n      calculate them.\n\nJi's counsel did not object.\n\n           The next day, the district court instructed the jury on\n\ndamages as follows:\n\n           If you find that [Ji] has proved her claim of a\n      violation of her right to publicity, you may award her\n      damages for any injury suffered as a result of that\n      violation. That means that you must determine how much\n      the plaintiff would have been paid for the uses to which\n      Bose eventually put her image, which is referred to in\n      the law as \"compensatory damages.\"\n\n           The object of compensatory damages is to award the\n      plaintiff the equivalent in money to any losses that she\n      suffered.   That requires you to consider all of the\n      evidence and determine what would have been a fair value\n      for the way that Bose eventually used the plaintiff's\n      photographs.\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fAt sidebar, before the case was sent to the jury, Ji's counsel\n\nobjected to neither the district court's instruction as delivered\n\nnor its omission of proposed instruction 23.\n\n           Bose argues that Ji's failures to object result in\n\nwaiver,   or,    alternatively,      forfeiture      of     her    instructional\n\nchallenge.\n\n           The   failure    to    object    promptly      and   properly   to   an\n\ninstruction generally forfeits an appellant's right to object on\n\nappeal.   See, e.g., Astro-Med, Inc. v. Nihon Kohden Am., Inc., 591\n\nF.3d 1, 20 (1st Cir. 2009) (\"Defendants did not object to the\n\ninstruction and they therefore forfeited their right to object on\n\nappeal.\"); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c)(1) (\"A party who objects\n\nto an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so\n\non the record, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the\n\ngrounds for the objection.\"); Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c)(2)(B) (a party\n\nmust “object[ ] promptly after learning that the instruction or\n\nrequest   will   be,   or   has    been,     given   or     refused”).      \"Our\n\ninterpretation of Rule 51 is quite strict.\" Astro-Med, 591 F.3d at\n\n20 (quoting Connelly v. Hyundai Motor Co., 351 F.3d 535, 544 (1st\n\nCir. 2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                   \"There is good\n\nreason for this strictness. We enforce our object-or-forfeit rules\n\nto compel litigants to afford the trial court an opportunity to\n\ncure [a] defective instruction and to prevent the litigants from\n\nensuring a new trial in the event of an adverse verdict [or\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fdiminutive damages award] by covertly relying on the error.\"                         Id.\n\n(second alteration supplied) (quoting Flynn v. AK Peters, Ltd., 377\n\nF.3d 13, 25 (1st Cir. 2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nForfeited objections may be reviewed for plain error only.                        Id.\n\n            Ji counters with a single argument.                    She urges us to\n\nrecognize, as some circuits have done, a judge-created exception to\n\nRule 51:     that a party need not object when doing so would have\n\nbeen \"futile and unavailing.\"               See, e.g., Gulliford v. Pierce\n\nCounty, 136 F.3d 1345, 1348 (9th Cir. 1998) (\"Where the district\n\ncourt is aware of the party's concerns with an instruction, and\n\nfurther objection would be unavailing, we will not require a futile\n\nformal objection.\"). According to Ji, an objection would have been\n\npointless because the district court was well aware of her position\n\non damages in light of earlier motion practice.\n\n            We have in the past rejected similar attempts to excuse\n\na party's failure to object.              See, e.g., Elliott v. S.D. Warren\n\nCo., 134 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"[W]e have held that strict\n\ncompliance       with    Rule   51   is   mandatory      and   that    a   failure      of\n\ncompliance will not be excused merely because the defaulting party\n\nbrought    the    same    matter     to   the    trial   judge's      attention    more\n\nspecifically at some other time.\"); Monomoy Fisheries, Inc. v.\n\nBruno & Stillman Yacht Co., 625 F.2d 1034, 1036-37 (1st Cir. 1980)\n\n(rejecting party's request to overlook its failure to object on the\n\nground that \"an objection following the charge was unnecessary\n\n                                          -18-\n\fbecause its position on the issue of mitigation had previously been\n\nclearly made known to the court and it was evident that a further\n\nobjection would have been unavailing\").   We did so, most recently,\n\nin Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc., 289 F.3d 128, 134 (1st Cir.), reh'g\n\ndenied, 306 F.3d 1151 (1st Cir. 2002) (denying rehearing en banc\n\ndespite urging to recognize a futility exception to Rule 51).\n\n            In light of our precedent, our review of this claim is\n\nfor plain error.   Torres-Rivera v. O'Neill-Cancel, 406 F.3d 43, 50\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).   \"To obtain relief under this standard, the party\n\nclaiming error must show (1) an error, (2) that is plain (i.e.,\n\nobvious and clear under current law) (3) that is likely to alter\n\nthe outcome, and (4) that is sufficiently fundamental to threaten\n\nthe fairness or integrity or public reputation of the judicial\n\nprocess.”     Id. (quoting Connelly, 351 F.3d at 545) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).     \"The requirement that the error is\n\nlikely to alter the outcome is particularly important in this\n\ncontext because '[a]n erroneous jury instruction necessitates a new\n\ntrial only if the error could have affected the result of the\n\njury's deliberations.'\"     Colon-Millin, 455 F.3d at 41 (quoting\n\nAllen v. Chance Mfg. Co., 873 F.2d 465, 469 (1st Cir. 1989)).\n\n            We need not linger on Ji's failure to satisfy these\n\nelements.    The district court's decision to omit Ji's proposed\n\ninstruction 23 -- that a royalty can constitute a percentage of\n\nsales -- was not plain error for the same reasons that its decision\n\n\n                                -19-\n\fto order Bose to produce usage data in lieu of sales data was not\n\nan abuse of discretion.       See supra Part II.A.1.     Even if the\n\nomission were plain error (it was not), Ji has not shown that it\n\nlikely altered the jury's damages award.         As discussed, Ji's\n\ntestifying expert, Wolfe, extrapolated Bose's revenues and opined\n\nthat a reasonable usage fee in this case could be as high as $2\n\nmillion based on a one-percent rate.     See supra Part II.A.1.   The\n\ndamages instruction that the district court delivered -- charging\n\nthe jury \"to consider all of the evidence and determine what would\n\nhave been a fair value for the way that Bose eventually used the\n\nplaintiff's photographs\" -- compelled the jury to consider, rather\n\nthan disregard, Wolfe's testimony.      In this light, we struggle to\n\nsee the probability that an additional instruction that royalties\n\nare sometimes calculated on the basis of sales would have resulted\n\nin a higher damages award.7\n\n\n     7\n      Rule 51 was amended in 2003, subsequent to our opinion in\nGray, 289 F.3d 128, to provide that \"[a] party may assign as error\n. . . a failure to give an instruction, if that party properly\nrequested it and -- unless the court rejected the request in a\ndefinitive ruling on the record -- also properly objected.\" Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 51(d)(1)(B) (emphasis supplied). But Ji neither relies\non nor even references the amended rule. Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d\n67, 87 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"When put to his mettle, it is the\nappellant's burden to establish that he has preserved such a claim\nof [instructional] error.\"); see United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d\n1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[A] litigant has an obligation to spell out\nits arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold its\npeace\") (quoting Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro, 843 F.2d 631, 635 (1st\nCir. 1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n     Even if we were to consider Ji's challenge preserved under\nRule 51(d)(1)(B) and thus subject to de novo review, the challenge\nwould nevertheless fail.     It is hornbook law that a properly\n\n                                 -20-\n\f          We    also    think    Ji's    proposed   instruction   22,   supra,\n\nundermines     her     general    critique      that   the   district   court\n\nmisunderstood damages under § 540.08 as compensatory in nature.\n\nProposed instruction 22 specifically requested an instruction on\n\ncompensatory damages (\"you should award Plaintiff an amount of\n\nmoney that . . . will fairly and adequately compensate Plaintiff\n\nfor the damages she has sustained\") and was substantially similar\n\nto the instruction that the district court delivered.\n\n          In sum, Ji has not shown that the district court's order\n\npartially granting her motion to compel constituted an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Nor has she shown that the district court's omission\n\nof her proposed instruction constituted plain error or that it\n\nlikely altered the damages award.               A new trial on damages is\n\ntherefore unwarranted.\n\n     B.   Challenge to Summary Judgment Denial\n\n          In their cross-appeals, Bose and White argue that trial\n\non Ji's right-to-publicity and privacy claims should never have\n\ntaken place in the first instance.             They argue that the district\n\ncourt should have granted their motions for summary judgment on\n\n\n\npreserved objection to the failure to give a requested jury\ninstruction \"constitutes reversible error only if it was\nprejudicial in light of the entire record.\"     United States v.\nButtrick, 432 F.3d 373, 376 (1st Cir. 2005). Here, as explained\nabove, the omission of Ji's royalty instruction did not prejudice\nher in light of Wolfe's extensive testimony about an appropriate\nusage fee and the district court's charge that the jury must\nconsider that evidence in assessing damages.\n\n                                        -21-\n\fwhat they contend was a pure legal issue:    whether the Voucher or\n\nthe Release controlled.   If the Voucher was unenforceable, as they\n\nclaim, then the Release controlled and through it Ji relinquished\n\nall rights to her images.\n\n          We do not reach the merits of their argument because\n\nneither Bose nor White properly preserved it in a motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law.8\n\n          Generally, the denial of a motion for summary judgment is\n\nnot reviewable after a full trial and final judgment on the merits.\n\nSee, e.g., Eastern Mt. Platform Tennis, Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams\n\nCo., 40 F.3d 492, 500 (1st Cir. 1994); Lama v. Borras, 16 F.3d 473,\n\n477 n.5 (1st Cir. 1994) (declining to address the defendants'\n\nchallenge because their \"attack on the denial of summary judgment\n\nhas been overtaken by subsequent events, namely, a full-dress trial\n\nand an adverse jury verdict.\").    \"The rationale for this rule has\n\nbeen based on the procedural fact that a denial of a motion for\n\nsummary judgment 'is merely a judge's determination that genuine\n\nissues of material fact exist.    It is not a judgment, and does not\n\nforeclose trial on issues on which summary judgment was sought.'\"\n\nSherwin-Williams, 40 F.3d at 500 (quoting Glaros v. H.H. Robertson\n\nCo., 797 F.2d 1564, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1986)).      Thus, in order to\n\n\n\n     8\n      For the identical reason, we do not reach the merits of\nWhite's separate claim that the district court erred in denying\nWhite summary judgment on Bose's claims against it for breach of\ncontract, misrepresentation, indemnification, and contribution.\n\n                                 -22-\n\fpreserve its challenge for appeal, a disappointed party must\n\nrestate its objection in a motion for judgment as a matter of law\n\n(\"JMOL\").      See id. at 497; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 50.               If that\n\ntoo is unsuccessful, then the propriety of the district court's\n\ndenial   of    JMOL    is     reviewable   on    appeal   from   final   judgment.\n\nSherwin-Williams, 40 F.3d at 497.\n\n              We have not recognized an exception to this rule, as some\n\ncircuits      have    done,    when   a   party's   challenge    is   based   on   a\n\ncircumscribed legal error, as opposed to an error concerning the\n\nexistence of fact issues.9            Instead, our rule is that even legal\n\nerrors cannot be reviewed unless the challenging party restates its\n\nobjection in a motion for JMOL.            See, e.g., Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz\n\nVelez, 341 F.3d 86, 92-93 (1st Cir. 2003) (declining to review a\n\nparty's challenge to the district court's denial of its motion for\n\nsummary judgment based on a purported legal error concerning\n\nqualified immunity when that party failed to move for JMOL); Mauser\n\nv. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan for Salaried Employees, 239 F.3d 51,\n\n\n\n     9\n      At least two other circuits have excused explicitly the\nfailure to move for JMOL and have reviewed the challenge anyway if\nit was based on a purported legal error. See Chemetall GMBH v. ZR\nEnergy, Inc., 320 F.3d 714, 720 (7th Cir. 2003); accord Ruyle v.\nContinental Oil Co., 44 F.3d 837, 841 (10th Cir. 1994). While this\nsplit may be resolved by the Supreme Court, see Ortiz v. Jordan,\n316 Fed. App'x 449 (6th Cir. 2009), cert. granted, 130 S. Ct. 2371\n(U.S. Apr. 26, 2010) (No. 09-737), we are bound by our precedents\nuntil the Supreme Court says otherwise. United States v. Holloway,\n499 F.3d 114, 118 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"it is axiomatic that new panels\nare bound by prior panel decisions in the absence of supervening\nauthority\").\n\n                                          -23-\n\f55 (1st Cir. 2001) (declining to review a party's challenge to the\n\ndistrict court's denial of its motion for summary judgment based on\n\na purported legal error concerning ERISA liability when that party\n\nfailed to move for JMOL).\n\n               Here, at the close of Ji's case, Bose moved for JMOL on\n\nthe grounds that Ji failed to present sufficient evidence (1) to\n\nestablish a violation of Chapter 93A, and (2) that she did not\n\nconsent to Bose's use of her image (an element of both her right-\n\nto-publicity and privacy claims). White moved on the former ground\n\nonly.        Following the verdict, Bose orally renewed its motion for\n\nJMOL \"with regard to liability.\"10        White did the same.   But at no\n\npoint did either Bose or White restate their challenge that the\n\nVoucher was unenforceable as a matter of law. Accordingly, we deem\n\nthat challenge waived.11\n\n\n     10\n      Although seemingly broad, the word \"liability\" as used in\nBose's renewed motion for JMOL cannot encompass the challenge that\nthe Voucher was unenforceable because that ground was not\narticulated in its earlier motion for JMOL. Correa v. Hosp. San\nFrancisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1196 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"The movant cannot\nuse [a renewed motion for JMOL] as a vehicle to introduce a legal\ntheory not distinctly articulated in its close-of-the-evidence\nmotion for [JMOL].\").\n        11\n      We realize that the Supreme Court may address this issue in\nOrtiz. See supra note 9. We wish to add, therefore, that Bose's\nand White's challenge to summary judgment denial would be\nunreviewable even if it were not waived. Although Bose and White\ncontend that their challenge presents a discrete legal issue, a\nfair reading of the record reveals that Bose and White sought\nresolution of conflicting factual inferences from competing\ncontracts and deposition testimony surrounding their creation.\nThis is evident in (1) the district court's rescript, which found\nthat the parties' proffered evidence made it \"abundantly clear\"\n\n                                   -24-\n\f     C.   Attorneys' Fees\n\n          Bose argues that the district court should have granted\n\nits motion for attorneys' fees. According to Bose, Ji's Lanham Act\n\nclaim was fabricated, entirely groundless, and nothing more than a\n\nruse \"to gain access to Bose's sensitive financial data in the hope\n\nof forcing an exorbitant settlement.\"      Bose contends that the\n\ndistrict court failed to give sufficient weight to these factors\n\nand therefore abused its discretion by denying Bose's motion.\n\n          We review the denial of a motion for attorneys' fees for\n\nmanifest abuse of discretion.   Boston's Children First v. City of\n\nBoston, 395 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 2005).   In doing so, we \"confine\n\nour review to whether the district court has made a mistake of law\n\nor incorrectly weighed (or failed to weigh) a factor in its\n\ndecision.\"   Richardson v. Miller, 279 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nWe review de novo the legal question of the meaning of \"exceptional\n\ncases\" under the Lanham Act.    Visible Sys. Corp. v. Unisys Corp.,\n\n551 F.3d 65, 81 (1st Cir. 2008).   For present purposes, we assume\n\nwithout deciding that Bose is a \"prevailing party\" under the Lanham\n\n\nthat \"there is a genuine issue of material fact which must be\nresolved by a jury,\" and (2) the parties' appellate briefs, which\nrefer extensively to conflicting deposition and trial testimony as\nevidence of the parties' intentions. See Chesapeake Paper Prods.\nCo. v. Stone & Webster Eng'g Corp., 51 F.3d 1229, 1235-36 (4th Cir.\n1995) (refusing to review summary judgment denial based on\nambiguity in competing contract documentation). Because we agree\nwith the district court that fact issues precluded summary\njudgment, Bose's and White's challenge falls under the general\nprohibition against reviewing summary judgment denials after a full\ntrial and final judgment on the merits.\n\n                                -25-\n\fAct.   15 U.S.C. § 1117(a) (providing for attorneys' fees to \"the\n\nprevailing party\").\n\n          The Lanham Act provides for attorneys' fees only in\n\n\"exceptional cases.\"   Id.   We have yet to construe this criterion\n\nin the context of a prevailing defendant. Cf. Tamko Roofing Prod.,\n\nInc. v. Ideal Roofing, Co., 282 F.3d 23, 31 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(construing criterion in context of prevailing       plaintiff, and\n\nholding that \"[i]n exceptional cases, attorneys' fees may be\n\nappropriate in circumstances where the acts of infringement were\n\nmalicious, fraudulent, deliberate, or willful\" or \"when equitable\n\nconsiderations justify such awards\") (quoting S. Rep. 93-1400, at\n\n5, 6 (1974)) (internal quotation marks omitted).    And we need not\n\ndo so today:   here, both parties agree that the standard applied by\n\nthe district court -- requiring \"something less than . . . bad\n\nfaith,\" such as a \"plaintiff's use of groundless arguments, failure\n\nto cite controlling law and generally oppressive nature of the\n\ncase\" -- was correct.     For purposes of this appeal, we assume\n\nwithout deciding that this is true.\n\n          Under this standard, the district court's decision to\n\ndeny attorneys' fees under § 1117(a) was well within the bounds of\n\nits discretion.    Although Ji's Lanham Act claim was defeated on\n\nsummary judgment, her claim was not entirely unfounded.      As the\n\ndistrict court observed, Ji met her summary judgment burden of\n\nshowing both similarity of likeness and similarity of marketing\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fchannels, two of the factors used to assess the likelihood of\n\nconsumer confusion under the Lanham Act.12\n\n          Ji's motion practice concerning her routine discovery\n\nrequests similarly fails to satisfy the Lanham Act's exceptionality\n\ncriterion.    There   is   nothing   particularly   oppressive   about\n\nattempting to discover financial information in connection with an\n\nintellectual property dispute.    Although Ji initially sought that\n\ninformation vis-a-vis her Lanham Act claim, once that claim was\n\ndismissed she requested it again in order to prove damages under §\n\n540.08.   On that theory, the district court ultimately compelled\n\nBose to produce some of the information Ji requested, and she used\n\nthat information at trial.     See supra Part II.A.1.      We see no\n\nevidence in the record that Ji sought or employed that information\n\nfor some ulterior purpose.\n\n          The inaccuracies in Ji's verified complaint, much touted\n\nby Bose as evidence of perfidiousness, are unfortunate -- even\n\nsloppy -- but they do not rise to the level of improper conduct\n\n\n\n     12\n      At oral argument, Bose's counsel asserted that the district\ncourt improperly considered the ultimate success of Ji's other\nclaims in determining whether to award attorneys' fees on Ji's\nunsuccessful Lanham Act claim. We do not read the district court's\nrescript quite that way, but in any event we do not reach the\nmatter because Bose did not raise this argument in its briefs.\nPiazza v. Aponte Roque, 909 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[A] court\nof appeals will not consider an issue raised for the first time at\noral argument.\").\n\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fnecessary to show that this case is exceptional.                     Many of the\n\nexamples Bose provides are jejune; others merely aggrandize Ji's\n\nstatus in immaterial ways.          This, without more, is not enough.\n\n              The district court also properly rejected Bose's request\n\nfor fees under § 1927.         In Jensen v. Philips Screw Co., we held\n\nthat    the    plain    language    of     §     1927   sanctions   unreasonable\n\nmultiplication, and not commencement, of proceedings:                \"Congress's\n\nuse of the verb 'multipl[y]' in the text of the statute clearly\n\ncontemplates that, to be sanctionable thereunder, conduct must have\n\nan effect on an already initiated proceeding. . . . [A] lawyer\n\ncannot violate section 1927 in the course of commencing an action.\"\n\n546 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir. 2008).                For this reason, we refused to\n\nsanction an attorney under § 1927 for failing \"to vet [his client]\n\nor investigate the bona fides of his claim.\"                Jensen, 546 F.3d at\n\n65.    Here, because Bose's argument is based solely on the failure\n\nof    Ji's    counsel   to   vet   the    representations     in    her   verified\n\ncomplaint, fees under § 1927 are foreclosed.\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n              For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is\n\naffirmed.      The parties shall bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\f",

The model, plaintiff Ting Ji (Ji), although successful at trial as to liability, insists that a new trial as to damages is necessary to cure the district court's purported errors in refusing to compel discovery and instructing the jury. The maker of the entertainment system, defendant Bose Corporation (Bose), and Ji's photographer, defendant White/Packert, Inc. (White), contest other rulings of the district court in their respective cross-appeals.</p>\n<p>After careful review, we affirm in all respects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>BACKGROUND</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In 2004, Ji participated in a photo shoot for which she was paid $1,000. On the same day, she signed two documents in connection with the shoot. The first was her modeling agency's voucher (Voucher) that confirmed her attendance at the shoot and entitled her to payment. The Voucher included a release assigning limited use of Ji's photos; among other things, the release prohibited the use of images for \"packages, point of purchase, [and] displays.\" The second instrument that Ji signed was White's adult release (Release), which included a broad release that assigned the \"absolute right and permission to ... use\" Ji's images \"for any purpose whatsoever.\"</p>\n<p>Thinking that it had secured a \"total buy-out\" of Ji's images based on the Release, White conveyed the images to Bose. Bose selected one of those images for the packaging of its 3.2.1® Series II DVD Home Entertainment System (the 321 System) and related promotional media. The image Bose selected featured the 321 System with Ji partially embracing a male model as they watched television from a couch. The photo was taken from behind the couch, exposing the back of Ji's head and little of her face; as a result, Ji is barely recognizable. Bose placed the image on the upper right-hand corner of each side of the 321 System's packaging.</p>\n<p>After Ji discovered her image while perusing a Best Buy store, she sued Bose in federal district court in Florida. She asserted a false endorsement claim under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), a right-to-publicity claim under Florida Statutes § 540.08, and a common-law claim for invasion of privacy. Bose successfully moved to transfer the case to federal district court in Massachusetts, where it is based. Ji amended her complaint to assert an additional claim for unfair trade practices under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.<sup>[1]</sup> She also added White as a defendant. Bose then filed cross-claims against White for breach of contract, misrepresentation, indemnification, and contribution.</p>\n<p>During discovery, Ji sought financial information from Bose, including sales data concerning its 321 System, on the ground that she needed that information to prove damages under the Lanham Act. Bose objected because, as a private company, its financial information, and particularly information concerning its sales, was sensitive and closely guarded. Bose also argued that discovery concerning such information should await the district court's ruling on Bose's pending and potentially <span class=\"star-pagination\">*120</span> dispositive motion for partial summary judgment on Ji's Lanham Act claim. The district court agreed and postponed discovery.</p>\n<p>The court eventually granted Bose's partial summary judgment motion and dismissed Ji's Lanham Act claim. Of the factors that courts have found necessary to prove false endorsement under the Lanham Act, the district court concluded that Ji could at best prove two and that six leaned decidedly in Bose's favor. <i>See </i><i>Downing v. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch,</i> 265 F.3d 994, 1007-08 (9th Cir.2001) (listing factors in false endorsement case). Of critical importance to the district court, Ji did not show, nor could the court credibly infer, that her identity (or \"mark,\" in trademark parlance) was familiar to Bose's target audience.</p>\n<p>Despite this setback, and the specter that her extant discovery requests would be fruitless, Ji again moved to compel production of Bose's financial information. This time Ji argued that she still needed that information in order to prove damages on her right-to-publicity claim because Florida law entitled her, if successful, to a \"reasonable royalty.\" Fla. Stat. § 540.08. The district court initially denied the motion. On further reflection, however, the court granted it in part and ordered Bose to produce information \"sufficient for [Ji] to inform the jury of the extent of [Bose's] use\" of her image:</p>\n<blockquote>This Court has previously ruled that the \"reasonable royalty\" language in Fla. Stat. § 540.08 provides for recovery of compensatory damages which does not implicate the net worth of the defendant. Nevertheless, the plaintiff may reasonably argue that her fair compensation, should she prove a violation of the statute, ought to depend, to some degree, upon Bose's usage of her image.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Bose will, therefore, produce to Ji ... information sufficient for her to inform the jury of the extent of its use of the subject photographs. Such information includes, to the extent that it is available, 1) the number of unit boxes on which her image appeared, 2) the number of point-of-purchase displays that were produced in the years in which her image was in use and 3) the number of promotional CD-ROMs that were distributed in the advertisement of the [321 System]. Bose will not be required to produce sales figures with respect to its [321 System] unless no other metric, such as those indicated in the preceding sentence, is ascertainable.</blockquote>\n<p>After the close of discovery, Bose and White moved for summary judgment on Ji's Florida claims. They asserted, and Ji agreed, that her Florida claims \"hinged on\" a question of contract interpretation: whether the Voucher or the Release controlled Bose's rights with respect to the images of Ji taken by White. Bose and White argued that the Release controlled because the Voucher left essential terms blank and was therefore unenforceable. Ji countered that the absence of some terms in the Voucher did not invalidate it. According to Ji, the Voucher controlled because it was executed earlier in time. At the very least, Ji argued, the question was more appropriate for the jury because it involved competing accounts of the parties' intentions. Viewing both contracts together, the district court concluded that it was unclear from the plain language which controlled the dispute. Because the parties submitted conflicting extrinsic evidence, and had retained expert witnesses in part to opine on this precise question, the district court denied summary judgment.</p>\n<p>The case proceeded to trial. After four days of argument and testimony, the jury found that Bose violated Ji's publicity and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> privacy rights under Florida law but awarded her only $10,000 (a fraction of her $2 million demand).<sup>[2]</sup> The jury also found that White was liable to Bose for the award.</p>\n<p>After judgment entered, Bose moved for attorneys' fees on Ji's unsuccessful false endorsement claim under an express provision in the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a) (\"[t]he Court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing party\"), and as a sanction for \"vexatious\" litigation under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 (providing for attorneys' fees in cases where an attorney \"unreasonably and vexatiously ... multiplies the proceedings in any case\"). The district court denied the motion on the ground that Ji's false endorsement claim, while meritless, failed to satisfy the high standards under either statute for the imposition of attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p>All parties appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n</h2>\n<p>These appeals raise three main issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Measure of Damages under Florida Statutes § 540.08</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Ji's principal grievance is that the district court fundamentally misunderstood the measure of damages under § 540.08 as compensatory rather than royalty based. Had the court correctly understood the law, Ji argues, it should have compelled Bose to produce <i>sales</i> data (number of units sold, revenues, profits), rather than mere <i>usage</i> data (number of units on which Ji's image appeared). Ji contends that without sales data the jury could not calculate a percentage of sales, and therefore could not determine a reasonable royalty. Ji also argues that the court's omission of her proposed royalty-based damages instruction was erroneous. Even if the jury had the benefit of sales data, Ji postulates, it still could not have determined a reasonable royalty because the court's charge restricted any award to compensatory damages. According to Ji, these errors require a new trial on damages.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>We disagree. In doing so, we need not prophesy whether the Florida Supreme Court would characterize damages under § 540.08 as compensatory or something else. Instead, we take each of Ji's two arguments on their own terms and reject them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Motion to Compel</i>\n</h2>\n<p>\"Discovery orders ordinarily are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\" <i>Cusumano v. Microsoft Corp.,</i> 162 F.3d 708, 713 (1st Cir.1998). This standard is \"not appellant-friendly,\" and we will not intervene without a \"clear showing of manifest <span class=\"star-pagination\">*122</span> injustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\" <i>Dennis v. Osram Sylvania, Inc.,</i> 549 F.3d 851, 860 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Modern Cont'l/Obayashi v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'n,</i> 196 F.3d 274, 281 (1st Cir.1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"A decision may be plainly wrong if it is based on an incorrect legal standard or a misapplication of the law.\" <i>In re Subpoena to Witzel,</i> 531 F.3d 113, 117 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>Section 540.08 of the Florida Statutes provides:</p>\n<blockquote>The person whose likeness is used ... may bring an action to enjoin such unauthorized publication, printing, display or other public use, and to recover damages for any loss or injury sustained by reason thereof, including an amount which would have been a reasonable royalty, and punitive or exemplary damages.</blockquote>\n<p>Fla. Stat. § 540.08(2). The statute does not define a reasonable royalty, or suggest what data is necessary to calculate what one might be in any particular set of facts. No opinion of the Florida Supreme Court, or of Florida's lower appellate courts, does either.</p>\n<p>Ji's argument that sales data are necessary to determine damages under § 540.08 is based on (1) an unpublished decision of a Florida federal district court, <i>Jackson v. Grupo Indus. Hotelero, SA,</i> No. 07-22046, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116770 (S.D.Fla. Apr. 29, 2009),<sup>[4]</sup> and (2) an analogy to patent law. Neither shows that the district court abused its discretion when it ordered Bose to produce usage data in lieu of sales data.</p>\n<p>In <i>Jackson,</i> following a bench trial, the district court found that the Coco Bongo nightclub violated § 540.08 by misappropriating the likeness of well-known entertainer Curtis Jackson (a/k/a \"50 Cent\") and his mark \"G-Unit\" (short for \"Guerilla Unit,\" the nom de guerre of Jackson's hip-hop group). <i>Id.</i> at *25. As for damages under the statute, the district court observed that the \"reasonable royalty measure of damages is taken to mean more than simply a percentage of actual profits. The measure now, very simply, means the actual <i>value</i> of what has been appropriated.\" <i>Id.</i> at *30-31 (emphasis supplied) (quoting <i>University Computing Co. v. Lykes-Youngstown Corp.,</i> 504 F.2d 518, 537 (5th Cir.1974)). To ascertain what that \"value\" was, the district court turned to basic principles of Florida's law of damages: \"The fundamental principle of the law of damages is that the person injured... shall have fair and just compensation commensurate with the loss sustained in consequence of the defendant's act which gives rise to the action.\" <i>Id.</i> at *35-36 (quoting <i>MCI WorldCom Network Servs. v. Mastec, Inc.,</i> 995 So.2d 221, 224 (Fla. 2008)). Framework in place, the district court determined that a lump-sum payment of $200,000 was a reasonable royalty for Coco Bongo's misappropriation. <i>Id.</i> at *36.</p>\n<p>Ji argues that the district court's $200,000 award in <i>Jackson</i> was \"based on $4,654,846 in salesa 4.3% royalty rate.\" Not true. Nowhere in its analysis of damages under § 540.08 did the district court mention, let alone consider, Coco Bongo's sales. <i>See id.</i> at 35-42. It only did so in calculating damages on Jackson's successful Lanham Act claim. <i>Id.</i> at 42 (\"[Jackson] is entitled to an award of profits for the infringing use of his trademark <i>only.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> <i>Compare 15 U.S.C. 1117, with Section 540.08, Fla. Stat.</i>\") (first emphasis supplied). Here, unlike in <i>Jackson,</i> Ji's Lanham Act claim was dismissed on summary judgment.</p>\n<p>For similar reasons, Ji's reliance on the court's statement in <i>Jackson,</i> quoted above, that a reasonable royalty means \"more than simply a percentage of actual profits,\" is mistaken. <i>Id.</i> at *30 (quoting <i>University Computing,</i> 504 F.2d at 537). \"Judges expect their pronunciamentos to be read in context.\" <i>In re Olympic Mills,</i> 477 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>Wisehart v. Davis,</i> 408 F.3d 321, 326 (7th Cir.2005)) (internal quotation marks and alternation omitted). The fallacy in Ji's argument is readily apparent. If the court in <i>Jackson</i> meant that profits were a component of a reasonable royalty, then why did it disregard Coco Bongo's profits (which were in the record) when it determined damages under § 540.08? Ji offers no reasonable explanation for this discrepancy.</p>\n<p>Ji's analogy to patent law measures of damages suffers a similar, but much quicker, fate. Whatever the variety of approaches under patent law, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>University Computing,</i> 504 F.2d at 536-39, the language of the federal statute is different and there is no basis to assume that § 540.08 was meant to have the same meaning.</p>\n<p>All in all, it is enough that Ji has failed to submit reliable indicia that the Florida Supreme Court would consider sales data as necessary components of a reasonable royalty under § 540.08. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in compelling Bose to produce usage data instead.</p>\n<p>If we had any doubts about this conclusion (we do not), Ji's failure to show prejudice resulting from the district court's order would remove them. As discussed, the district court ordered Bose to tell Ji the \"number of unit boxes on which her image appeared.\" Bose thereafter told Ji, via a supplemental interrogatory response, that Ji's image appeared on approximately 206,000 units of the 321 System. Based on that data point, and record evidence that the 321 System sold for $999 per unit, Ji's expert witness, Richard Wolfe, an attorney specializing in entertainment law, was able to extrapolate that Bose's gross revenues from the 321 System were as high as about $206 million. Applying a rate of between a half percent and one percent of that figure, Wolfe testified at trial that in his opinion a reasonable \"usage fee\" (which he equated with a \"royalty\") would be between $1 million and $2 million.<sup>[5]</sup> At closing, Ji's counsel, specifically referencing Wolfe's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> testimony, argued that the jury should award Ji a $2 million fee based on a one-percent rate.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Ji argues that although Wolfe was able to extrapolate maximum potential revenues based on the number of units Bose packaged, he could not determine actual revenues without knowing how many of those units Bose sold. This is, of course, true. But this could not have prejudiced Ji. The number of units Bose sold would have to be equal to or, more likely, less than the number of units Bose packaged. Therefore, the usage fee Ji's expert recommended was the upper end of a range based on what actual revenues could have been. Actual revenues were probably less, but Bose (perhaps against its interest) did not object and the jury was free to agree with Wolfe.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Jury Instructions</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Ji proposed the following two instructions, and others, to the district court:</p>\n<blockquote>[Proposed Jury Instruction No. 22:] If you find for the Plaintiff on her claims for violation of right to publicity, you should award Plaintiff an amount of money that the preponderance of the evidence shows will fairly and adequately compensate Plaintiff for the damages she has sustained by virtue of Bose's appropriation and exploitation of Plaintiff's image without her express consent. If you find that the Plaintiff has been injured by Bose in violation of her rights under Florida Statute § 540.08, she is entitled to receive damages from Bose which may include a reasonable royalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Proposed Jury Instruction No. 23:] A \"royalty\" can be established several different ways. One method of establishing a royalty is by the total amount of the [<i>sic</i>] Bose's profits resulting from its exploitation of Plaintiff's image.</blockquote>\n<p>At the charge conference, the district court stated that it would deliver the substance of proposed instruction 22 but not 23:</p>\n<blockquote>I will give the substance of 22. However, Bose's objections have been noted, and the instructions will certainly be consistent with this Court's prior rulings. On No. 23, I am not going to give that. We'll tell the jury about what compensatory damages are but not how to calculate them.</blockquote>\n<p>Ji's counsel did not object.</p>\n<p>The next day, the district court instructed the jury on damages as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> If you find that [Ji] has proved her claim of a violation of her right to publicity, you may award her damages for any injury suffered as a result of that violation. That means that you must determine how much the plaintiff would have been paid for the uses to which Bose eventually put her image, which is referred to in the law as \"compensatory damages.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The object of compensatory damages is to award the plaintiff the equivalent in money to any losses that she suffered. That requires you to consider all of the evidence and determine what would have been a fair value for the way that Bose eventually used the plaintiff's photographs.</blockquote>\n<p>At sidebar, before the case was sent to the jury, Ji's counsel objected to neither the district court's instruction as delivered nor its omission of proposed instruction 23.</p>\n<p>Bose argues that Ji's failures to object result in waiver, or, alternatively, forfeiture of her instructional challenge.</p>\n<p>The failure to object promptly and properly to an instruction generally forfeits an appellant's right to object on appeal. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Astro-Med, Inc. v. Nihon Kohden Am., Inc.,</i> 591 F.3d 1, 20 (1st Cir.2009) (\"Defendants did not object to the instruction and they therefore forfeited their right to object on appeal.\"); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c)(1) (\"A party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so on the record, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection.\"); Fed. R.Civ.P. 51(c)(2)(B) (a party must \"object[] promptly after learning that the instruction or request will be, or has been, given or refused\"). \"Our interpretation of Rule 51 is quite strict.\" <i>Astro-Med,</i> 591 F.3d at 20 (quoting <i>Connelly v. Hyundai Motor Co.,</i> 351 F.3d 535, 544 (1st Cir. 2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"There is good reason for this strictness. We enforce our object-or-forfeit rules to compel litigants to afford the trial court an opportunity to cure [a] defective instruction and to prevent the litigants from ensuring a new trial in the event of an adverse verdict [or diminutive damages award] by covertly relying on the error.\" <i>Id.</i> (second alteration supplied) (quoting <i>Flynn v. AK Peters, Ltd.,</i> 377 F.3d 13, 25 (1st Cir.2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Forfeited objections may be reviewed for plain error only. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Ji counters with a single argument. She urges us to recognize, as some circuits have done, a judge-created exception to Rule 51: that a party need not object when doing so would have been \"futile and unavailing.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gulliford v. Pierce County,</i> 136 F.3d 1345, 1348 (9th Cir.1998) (\"Where the district court is aware of the party's concerns with an instruction, and further objection would be unavailing, we will not require a futile formal objection.\"). According to Ji, an objection would have been pointless because the district court was well aware of her position on damages in light of earlier motion practice.</p>\n<p>We have in the past rejected similar attempts to excuse a party's failure to object. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Elliott v. S.D. Warren Co.,</i> 134 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1998) (\"[W]e have held that strict compliance with Rule 51 is mandatory and that a failure of compliance will not be excused merely because the defaulting party brought the same matter to the trial judge's attention more specifically at some other time.\"); <i>Monomoy Fisheries, Inc. v. Bruno &amp; Stillman Yacht Co.,</i> 625 F.2d 1034, 1036-37 (1st Cir.1980) (rejecting party's request to overlook its failure to object on the ground that \"an objection following the charge was unnecessary because its position on the issue of mitigation had previously been clearly made known to the court and it was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> evident that a further objection would have been unavailing\"). We did so, most recently, in <i>Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc.,</i> 289 F.3d 128, 134 (1st Cir.), <i>reh'g denied,</i> 306 F.3d 1151 (1st Cir.2002) (denying rehearing en banc despite urging to recognize a futility exception to Rule 51).</p>\n<p>In light of our precedent, our review of this claim is for plain error. <i>Torres-Rivera v. O'Neill-Cancel,</i> 406 F.3d 43, 50 (1st Cir.2005). \"To obtain relief under this standard, the party claiming error must show (1) an error, (2) that is plain (<i>i.e.,</i> obvious and clear under current law) (3) that is likely to alter the outcome, and (4) that is sufficiently fundamental to threaten the fairness or integrity or public reputation of the judicial process.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Connelly,</i> 351 F.3d at 545) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"The requirement that the error is likely to alter the outcome is particularly important in this context because `[a]n erroneous jury instruction necessitates a new trial only if the error could have affected the result of the jury's deliberations.'\" <i>Colon-Millin,</i> 455 F.3d at 41 (quoting <i>Allen v. Chance Mfg. Co.,</i> 873 F.2d 465, 469 (1st Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p>We need not linger on Ji's failure to satisfy these elements. The district court's decision to omit Ji's proposed instruction 23that a royalty can constitute a percentage of saleswas not plain error for the same reasons that its decision to order Bose to produce usage data in lieu of sales data was not an abuse of discretion. See <i>supra</i> Part II.A.1. Even if the omission were plain error (it was not), Ji has not shown that it likely altered the jury's damages award. As discussed, Ji's testifying expert, Wolfe, extrapolated Bose's revenues and opined that a reasonable usage fee in this case could be as high as $2 million based on a one-percent rate. See <i>supra</i> Part II.A.1. The damages instruction that the district court delivered charging the jury \"to consider all of the evidence and determine what would have been a fair value for the way that Bose eventually used the plaintiff's photographs\"compelled the jury to consider, rather than disregard, Wolfe's testimony. In this light, we struggle to see the probability that an additional instruction that royalties are sometimes calculated on the basis of sales would have resulted in a higher damages award.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>We also think Ji's proposed instruction 22, <i>supra,</i> undermines her general critique that the district court misunderstood damages under § 540.08 as compensatory in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> nature. Proposed instruction 22 specifically requested an instruction on compensatory damages (\"you should award Plaintiff an amount of money that ... will fairly and adequately compensate Plaintiff for the damages she has sustained\") and was substantially similar to the instruction that the district court delivered.</p>\n<p>In sum, Ji has not shown that the district court's order partially granting her motion to compel constituted an abuse of discretion. Nor has she shown that the district court's omission of her proposed instruction constituted plain error or that it likely altered the damages award. A new trial on damages is therefore unwarranted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Challenge to Summary Judgment Denial</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In their cross-appeals, Bose and White argue that trial on Ji's right-to-publicity and privacy claims should never have taken place in the first instance. They argue that the district court should have granted their motions for summary judgment on what they contend was a pure legal issue: whether the Voucher or the Release controlled. If the Voucher was unenforceable, as they claim, then the Release controlled and through it Ji relinquished all rights to her images.</p>\n<p>We do not reach the merits of their argument because neither Bose nor White properly preserved it in a motion for judgment as a matter of law.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Generally, the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not reviewable after a full trial and final judgment on the merits. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Eastern Mt. Platform Tennis, Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co.,</i> 40 F.3d 492, 500 (1st Cir.1994); <i>Lama v. Borras,</i> 16 F.3d 473, 477 n. 5 (1st Cir. 1994) (declining to address the defendants' challenge because their \"attack on the denial of summary judgment has been overtaken by subsequent events, namely, a full-dress trial and an adverse jury verdict.\"). \"The rationale for this rule has been based on the procedural fact that a denial of a motion for summary judgment `is merely a judge's determination that genuine issues of material fact exist. It is not a judgment, and does not foreclose trial on issues on which summary judgment was sought.'\" <i>Sherwin-Williams,</i> 40 F.3d at 500 (quoting <i>Glaros v. H.H. Robertson Co.,</i> 797 F.2d 1564, 1573 (Fed.Cir.1986)). Thus, in order to preserve its challenge for appeal, a disappointed party must restate its objection in a motion for judgment as a matter of law (\"JMOL\"). <i>See id.</i> at 497; <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 50. If that too is unsuccessful, then the propriety of the district court's denial of JMOL is reviewable on appeal from final judgment. <i>Sherwin-Williams,</i> 40 F.3d at 497.</p>\n<p>We have not recognized an exception to this rule, as some circuits have done, when a party's challenge is based on a circumscribed legal error, as opposed to an error concerning the existence of fact issues.<sup>[9]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> Instead, our rule is that even legal errors cannot be reviewed unless the challenging party restates its objection in a motion for JMOL. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz Velez,</i> 341 F.3d 86, 92-93 (1st Cir.2003) (declining to review a party's challenge to the district court's denial of its motion for summary judgment based on a purported legal error concerning qualified immunity when that party failed to move for JMOL); <i>Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan for Salaried Employees,</i> 239 F.3d 51, 55 (1st Cir.2001) (declining to review a party's challenge to the district court's denial of its motion for summary judgment based on a purported legal error concerning ERISA liability when that party failed to move for JMOL).</p>\n<p>Here, at the close of Ji's case, Bose moved for JMOL on the grounds that Ji failed to present sufficient evidence (1) to establish a violation of Chapter 93A, and (2) that she did not consent to Bose's use of her image (an element of both her right-to-publicity and privacy claims). White moved on the former ground only. Following the verdict, Bose orally renewed its motion for JMOL \"with regard to liability.\"<sup>[10]</sup> White did the same. But at no point did either Bose or White restate their challenge that the Voucher was unenforceable as a matter of law. Accordingly, we deem that challenge waived.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Attorneys' Fees</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Bose argues that the district court should have granted its motion for attorneys' fees. According to Bose, Ji's Lanham Act claim was fabricated, entirely groundless, and nothing more than a ruse \"to gain access to Bose's sensitive financial data in the hope of forcing an exorbitant settlement.\" Bose contends that the district court failed to give sufficient weight to these factors and therefore abused its discretion by denying Bose's motion.</p>\n<p>We review the denial of a motion for attorneys' fees for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>Boston's Children First v. City of Boston,</i> 395 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 2005). In doing so, we \"confine our review to whether the district court has made a mistake of law or incorrectly weighed (or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> failed to weigh) a factor in its decision.\" <i>Richardson v. Miller,</i> 279 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2002). We review <i>de novo</i> the legal question of the meaning of \"exceptional cases\" under the Lanham Act. <i>Visible Sys. Corp. v. Unisys Corp.,</i> 551 F.3d 65, 81 (1st Cir.2008). For present purposes, we assume without deciding that Bose is a \"prevailing party\" under the Lanham Act. 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a) (providing for attorneys' fees to \"the prevailing party\").</p>\n<p>The Lanham Act provides for attorneys' fees only in \"exceptional cases.\" <i>Id.</i> We have yet to construe this criterion in the context of a prevailing <i>defendant. Cf. </i><i>Tamko Roofing Prod., Inc. v. Ideal Roofing, Co.,</i> 282 F.3d 23, 31 (1st Cir.2002) (construing criterion in context of prevailing plaintiff, and holding that \"[i]n exceptional cases, attorneys' fees may be appropriate in circumstances where the acts of infringement were malicious, fraudulent, deliberate, or willful\" or \"when equitable considerations justify such awards\") (quoting S. Rep. 93-1400, at 5, 6 (1974), 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7132, 7133, 7137) (internal quotation marks omitted). And we need not do so today: here, both parties agree that the standard applied by the district courtrequiring \"something less than ... bad faith,\" such as a \"plaintiff's use of groundless arguments, failure to cite controlling law and generally oppressive nature of the case\"was correct. For purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that this is true.</p>\n<p>Under this standard, the district court's decision to deny attorneys' fees under § 1117(a) was well within the bounds of its discretion. Although Ji's Lanham Act claim was defeated on summary judgment, her claim was not entirely unfounded. As the district court observed, Ji met her summary judgment burden of showing both similarity of likeness and similarity of marketing channels, two of the factors used to assess the likelihood of consumer confusion under the Lanham Act.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Ji's motion practice concerning her routine discovery requests similarly fails to satisfy the Lanham Act's exceptionality criterion. There is nothing particularly oppressive about attempting to discover financial information in connection with an intellectual property dispute. Although Ji initially sought that information vis-a-vis her Lanham Act claim, once that claim was dismissed she requested it again in order to prove damages under § 540.08. On that theory, the district court ultimately compelled Bose to produce some of the information Ji requested, and she used that information at trial. See <i>supra</i> Part II.A.1. We see no evidence in the record that Ji sought or employed that information for some ulterior purpose.</p>\n<p>The inaccuracies in Ji's verified complaint, much touted by Bose as evidence of perfidiousness, are unfortunateeven sloppybut they do not rise to the level of improper conduct necessary to show that this case is exceptional. Many of the examples Bose provides are jejune; others merely aggrandize Ji's status in immaterial ways. This, without more, is not enough.</p>\n<p>The district court also properly rejected Bose's request for fees under § 1927. In <i>Jensen v. Phillips Screw Co.,</i> we held that the plain language of § 1927 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> sanctions unreasonable <i>multiplication,</i> and not <i>commencement,</i> of proceedings: \"Congress's use of the verb `multipl[y]' in the text of the statute clearly contemplates that, to be sanctionable thereunder, conduct must have an effect on an already initiated proceeding.... [A] lawyer cannot violate section 1927 in the course of commencing an action.\" 546 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir.2008). For this reason, we refused to sanction an attorney under § 1927 for failing \"to vet [his client] or investigate the bona fides of his claim.\" <i>Jensen,</i> 546 F.3d at 65. Here, because Bose's argument is based solely on the failure of Ji's counsel to vet the representations in her verified complaint, fees under § 1927 are foreclosed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i> The parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The district court issued a posttrial order finding no violation of Chapter 93A as to either Bose or White. Ji has not appealed that ruling.</p>\n<p>[2]  The first question on the verdict form asked the jury whether Bose violated Ji's publicity <i>or</i> privacy rights under Florida law and required a yes-or-no answer. The jury foreman checked the \"yes\" box. The second question asked the jury to enter an amount of damages proved as a result of Bose's violation of Ji's right to publicity <i>or</i> its invasion of her privacy <i>or</i> both. The jury foreman wrote \"$10,000.\"\n</p>\n<p>Based on the verdict form's use of the disjunctive, it is possible that the jury determined that there was no violation of Fla. Stat. § 540.08, and awarded damages on Ji's common-law privacy claim only. Whether this possibility impacts our review of the measure of damages available under § 540.08 is an issue that the parties do not address. Because the parties agreed below that both claims turned on the same question (whether Ji consented to the use of her images), and because we will never know the exact basis of the jury's determination, we proceed to address the parties' dispute anyway.</p>\n<p>[3]  Notably, Ji does not argue on appeal that the jury's $10,000 damages award was unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p>[4]  Of course, decisions of federal trial courts interpreting state law are not binding on state courts (or on federal appellate courts attempting to divine how a state court might rule).</p>\n<p>[5]  Because Ji hotly contests this point, we provide excerpts from Wolfe's trial testimony:\n</p>\n<p>[Ji's Counsel:] [B]ased on your experience with these different types of usages, can you describe for us the different types of compensation that you have seen models receive for these different usages?</p>\n<p>[Wolfe:] Sure. And, again, it ranges the gamut, and it also depends upon the stature of the model and it depends upon the intended use by the ultimate user.... [W]here the image is going to be used for a commercial purpose ... we're typically going to negotiate for a flat fee for the model's time to take the photos, and that <i>we would negotiate an ongoing fee, sometimes called a royalty, which would be commensurate with the uses by the user of the image</i>....</p>\n<p>[Ji's Counsel:] [D]o you have an idea of the numerical circulation of my client's picture by Bose?</p>\n<p>[Wolfe:] Yes.</p>\n<p>[Ji's Counsel:] And what is that understanding?</p>\n<p>[Wolfe:] That the picture was used on the product approximately 206,000 times....</p>\n<p>[Ji's Counsel:] Based on your experience in negotiating compensation packages for modeling agencies and their models, do you have an opinion as to the compensation to which a model whose image is used on $206 million worth of merchandise might be entitled?</p>\n<p>[Wolfe:] I do.</p>\n<p>[Ji's Counsel:] What is that opinion? ...</p>\n<p>[Wolfe:] [B]ased on my experience, I would negotiate for one-half of one percent to one percent, and if you take 206,000 uses at $999 at the low end of the scale, you're at approximately <i>$1 million is a reasonable utilization and a reasonable compensation to the model at the low end, and at the high end, I would say $2 million at the one percent.</i></p>\n<p>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p>[6]  For the same reason, we provide an excerpt from Ji's counsel's closing argument:\n</p>\n<p>Let me tell you how we believe that you [the jury] should [determine damages]. We believe that you should follow the testimony, which was unchallenged, by Mr. Wolfe, who stated his experience with modeling agencies and models, and <i>he clearly told you that a reasonable fee would be a usage fee,</i> and I know it's large, but that is based on $206 million worth of commercial boxes. <i>He said usage fees are the way that models like Ms. Ji are compensated</i>.... From Mr. Wolfe, he's basically looked at the situation, and <i>he said that a fee of one-half to one percent, one-half to one percent of the unauthorized use of her image on $206 million worth of merchandise would be a fair and reasonable fee.</i> She's not a celebrity, she's not a top model, but Mr. Wolfe said that someone in a like situation, someone who usedthey used their image in unauthorized ways, <i>a reasonable usage fee would be between $1 million and $2 million.</i></p>\n<p>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p>[7]  Rule 51 was amended in 2003, subsequent to our opinion in <i>Gray,</i> 289 F.3d 128, to provide that \"[a] party may assign as error... a failure to give an instruction, if that party properly requested it and<i>unless the court rejected the request in a definitive ruling on the record</i>also properly objected.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 51(d)(1)(B) (emphasis supplied). But Ji neither relies on nor even references the amended rule. <i>Faigin v. Kelly,</i> 184 F.3d 67, 87 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"When put to his mettle, it is the appellant's burden to establish that he has preserved such a claim of [instructional] error.\"); <i>see </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[A] litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold its peace\") (quoting <i>Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro,</i> 843 F.2d 631, 635 (1st Cir.1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n</p>\n<p>Even if we were to consider Ji's challenge preserved under Rule 51(d)(1)(B) and thus subject to <i>de novo</i> review, the challenge would nevertheless fail. It is hornbook law that a properly preserved objection to the failure to give a requested jury instruction \"constitutes reversible error only if it was prejudicial in light of the entire record.\" <i>United States v. Buttrick,</i> 432 F.3d 373, 376 (1st Cir.2005). Here, as explained above, the omission of Ji's royalty instruction did not prejudice her in light of Wolfe's extensive testimony about an appropriate usage fee and the district court's charge that the jury must consider that evidence in assessing damages.</p>\n<p>[8]  For the identical reason, we do not reach the merits of White's separate claim that the district court erred in denying White summary judgment on Bose's claims against it for breach of contract, misrepresentation, indemnification, and contribution.</p>\n<p>[9]  At least two other circuits have excused explicitly the failure to move for JMOL and have reviewed the challenge anyway if it was based on a purported legal error. <i>See </i><i>Chemetall GMBH v. ZR Energy, Inc.,</i> 320 F.3d 714, 720 (7th Cir.2003); <i>accord </i><i>Ruyle v. Continental Oil Co.,</i> 44 F.3d 837, 841 (10th Cir.1994). While this split may be resolved by the Supreme Court, <i>see </i><i>Ortiz v. Jordan,</i> 316 Fed. Appx. 449 (6th Cir.2009), <i>cert. granted,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2371, 176 L.Ed.2d 767 (U.S. Apr. 26, 2010) (No. 09-737), we are bound by our precedents until the Supreme Court says otherwise. <i>United States v. Holloway,</i> 499 F.3d 114, 118 (1st Cir.2007) (\"it is axiomatic that new panels are bound by prior panel decisions in the absence of supervening authority\").</p>\n<p>[10]  Although seemingly broad, the word \"liability\" as used in Bose's renewed motion for JMOL cannot encompass the challenge that the Voucher was unenforceable because that ground was not articulated in its earlier motion for JMOL. <i>Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco,</i> 69 F.3d 1184, 1196 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"The movant cannot use [a renewed motion for JMOL] as a vehicle to introduce a legal theory not distinctly articulated in its close-of-the-evidence motion for [JMOL].\").</p>\n<p>[11]  We realize that the Supreme Court may address this issue in <i>Ortiz.</i> See <i>supra</i> note 9. We wish to add, therefore, that Bose's and White's challenge to summary judgment denial would be unreviewable even if it were not waived. Although Bose and White contend that their challenge presents a discrete legal issue, a fair reading of the record reveals that Bose and White sought resolution of conflicting factual inferences from competing contracts and deposition testimony surrounding their creation. This is evident in (1) the district court's rescript, which found that the parties' proffered evidence made it \"abundantly clear\" that \"there is a genuine issue of material fact which must be resolved by a jury,\" and (2) the parties' appellate briefs, which refer extensively to conflicting deposition and trial testimony as evidence of the parties' intentions. <i>See </i><i>Chesapeake Paper Prods. Co. v. Stone &amp; Webster Eng'g Corp.,</i> 51 F.3d 1229, 1235-36 (4th Cir.1995) (refusing to review summary judgment denial based on ambiguity in competing contract documentation). Because we agree with the district court that fact issues precluded summary judgment, Bose's and White's challenge falls under the general prohibition against reviewing summary judgment denials after a full trial and final judgment on the merits.</p>\n<p>[12]  At oral argument, Bose's counsel asserted that the district court improperly considered the ultimate success of Ji's other claims in determining whether to award attorneys' fees on Ji's unsuccessful Lanham Act claim. We do not read the district court's rescript quite that way, but in any event we do not reach the matter because Bose did not raise this argument in its briefs. <i>Piazza v. Aponte Roque,</i> 909 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[A] court of appeals will not consider an issue raised for the first time at oral argument.\").</p>\n\n</div>",

The model, plaintiff Ting Ji (Ji), although successful at trial as to liability, insists that a new trial as to damages is necessary to cure the district court's purported errors in refusing to compel discovery and instructing the jury. The maker of the entertainment system, defendant Bose Corporation (Bose), and Ji's photographer, defendant White/Packert, Inc. (White), contest other rulings of the district court in their respective cross-appeals.</p>\n<p>After careful review, we affirm in all respects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>BACKGROUND</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In 2004, Ji participated in a photo shoot for which she was paid $1,000. On the same day, she signed two documents in connection with the shoot. The first was her modeling agency's voucher (Voucher) that confirmed her attendance at the shoot and entitled her to payment. The Voucher included a release assigning limited use of Ji's photos; among other things, the release prohibited the use of images for \"packages, point of purchase, [and] displays.\" The second instrument that Ji signed was White's adult release (Release), which included a broad release that assigned the \"absolute right and permission to ... use\" Ji's images \"for any purpose whatsoever.\"</p>\n<p>Thinking that it had secured a \"total buy-out\" of Ji's images based on the Release, White conveyed the images to Bose. Bose selected one of those images for the packaging of its 3.2.1® Series II DVD Home Entertainment System (the 321 System) and related promotional media. The image Bose selected featured the 321 System with Ji partially embracing a male model as they watched television from a couch. The photo was taken from behind the couch, exposing the back of Ji's head and little of her face; as a result, Ji is barely recognizable. Bose placed the image on the upper right-hand corner of each side of the 321 System's packaging.</p>\n<p>After Ji discovered her image while perusing a Best Buy store, she sued Bose in federal district court in Florida. She asserted a false endorsement claim under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), a right-to-publicity claim under Florida Statutes § 540.08, and a common-law claim for invasion of privacy. Bose successfully moved to transfer the case to federal district court in Massachusetts, where it is based. Ji amended her complaint to assert an additional claim for unfair trade practices under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.<sup>[1]</sup> She also added White as a defendant. Bose then filed cross-claims against White for breach of contract, misrepresentation, indemnification, and contribution.</p>\n<p>During discovery, Ji sought financial information from Bose, including sales data concerning its 321 System, on the ground that she needed that information to prove damages under the Lanham Act. Bose objected because, as a private company, its financial information, and particularly information concerning its sales, was sensitive and closely guarded. Bose also argued that discovery concerning such information should await the district court's ruling on Bose's pending and potentially <span class=\"star-pagination\">*120</span> dispositive motion for partial summary judgment on Ji's Lanham Act claim. The district court agreed and postponed discovery.</p>\n<p>The court eventually granted Bose's partial summary judgment motion and dismissed Ji's Lanham Act claim. Of the factors that courts have found necessary to prove false endorsement under the Lanham Act, the district court concluded that Ji could at best prove two and that six leaned decidedly in Bose's favor. <i>See </i><i>Downing v. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774958\"><a href=\"/opinion/774958/george-downing-an-individual-paul-strauch-an-individual-rick-steere-an/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span>, 1007-08 (9th Cir.2001) (listing factors in false endorsement case). Of critical importance to the district court, Ji did not show, nor could the court credibly infer, that her identity (or \"mark,\" in trademark parlance) was familiar to Bose's target audience.</p>\n<p>Despite this setback, and the specter that her extant discovery requests would be fruitless, Ji again moved to compel production of Bose's financial information. This time Ji argued that she still needed that information in order to prove damages on her right-to-publicity claim because Florida law entitled her, if successful, to a \"reasonable royalty.\" Fla. Stat. § 540.08. The district court initially denied the motion. On further reflection, however, the court granted it in part and ordered Bose to produce information \"sufficient for [Ji] to inform the jury of the extent of [Bose's] use\" of her image:</p>\n<blockquote>This Court has previously ruled that the \"reasonable royalty\" language in Fla. Stat. § 540.08 provides for recovery of compensatory damages which does not implicate the net worth of the defendant. Nevertheless, the plaintiff may reasonably argue that her fair compensation, should she prove a violation of the statute, ought to depend, to some degree, upon Bose's usage of her image.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Bose will, therefore, produce to Ji ... information sufficient for her to inform the jury of the extent of its use of the subject photographs. Such information includes, to the extent that it is available, 1) the number of unit boxes on which her image appeared, 2) the number of point-of-purchase displays that were produced in the years in which her image was in use and 3) the number of promotional CD-ROMs that were distributed in the advertisement of the [321 System]. Bose will not be required to produce sales figures with respect to its [321 System] unless no other metric, such as those indicated in the preceding sentence, is ascertainable.</blockquote>\n<p>After the close of discovery, Bose and White moved for summary judgment on Ji's Florida claims. They asserted, and Ji agreed, that her Florida claims \"hinged on\" a question of contract interpretation: whether the Voucher or the Release controlled Bose's rights with respect to the images of Ji taken by White. Bose and White argued that the Release controlled because the Voucher left essential terms blank and was therefore unenforceable. Ji countered that the absence of some terms in the Voucher did not invalidate it. According to Ji, the Voucher controlled because it was executed earlier in time. At the very least, Ji argued, the question was more appropriate for the jury because it involved competing accounts of the parties' intentions. Viewing both contracts together, the district court concluded that it was unclear from the plain language which controlled the dispute. Because the parties submitted conflicting extrinsic evidence, and had retained expert witnesses in part to opine on this precise question, the district court denied summary judgment.</p>\n<p>The case proceeded to trial. After four days of argument and testimony, the jury found that Bose violated Ji's publicity and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> privacy rights under Florida law but awarded her only $10,000 (a fraction of her $2 million demand).<sup>[2]</sup> The jury also found that White was liable to Bose for the award.</p>\n<p>After judgment entered, Bose moved for attorneys' fees on Ji's unsuccessful false endorsement claim under an express provision in the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a) (\"[t]he Court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing party\"), and as a sanction for \"vexatious\" litigation under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 (providing for attorneys' fees in cases where an attorney \"unreasonably and vexatiously ... multiplies the proceedings in any case\"). The district court denied the motion on the ground that Ji's false endorsement claim, while meritless, failed to satisfy the high standards under either statute for the imposition of attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p>All parties appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n</h2>\n<p>These appeals raise three main issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Measure of Damages under Florida Statutes § 540.08</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Ji's principal grievance is that the district court fundamentally misunderstood the measure of damages under § 540.08 as compensatory rather than royalty based. Had the court correctly understood the law, Ji argues, it should have compelled Bose to produce <i>sales</i> data (number of units sold, revenues, profits), rather than mere <i>usage</i> data (number of units on which Ji's image appeared). Ji contends that without sales data the jury could not calculate a percentage of sales, and therefore could not determine a reasonable royalty. Ji also argues that the court's omission of her proposed royalty-based damages instruction was erroneous. Even if the jury had the benefit of sales data, Ji postulates, it still could not have determined a reasonable royalty because the court's charge restricted any award to compensatory damages. According to Ji, these errors require a new trial on damages.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>We disagree. In doing so, we need not prophesy whether the Florida Supreme Court would characterize damages under § 540.08 as compensatory or something else. Instead, we take each of Ji's two arguments on their own terms and reject them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Motion to Compel</i>\n</h2>\n<p>\"Discovery orders ordinarily are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\" <i>Cusumano v.

Stat. § 540.08(2). The statute does not define a reasonable royalty, or suggest what data is necessary to calculate what one might be in any particular set of facts. No opinion of the Florida Supreme Court, or of Florida's lower appellate courts, does either.</p>\n<p>Ji's argument that sales data are necessary to determine damages under § 540.08 is based on (1) an unpublished decision of a Florida federal district court, <i>Jackson v. Grupo Indus. Hotelero, SA,</i> No. 07-22046, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">116770</span></span> (S.D.Fla. Apr. 29, 2009),<sup>[4]</sup> and (2) an analogy to patent law. Neither shows that the district court abused its discretion when it ordered Bose to produce usage data in lieu of sales data.</p>\n<p>In <i>Jackson,</i> following a bench trial, the district court found that the Coco Bongo nightclub violated § 540.08 by misappropriating the likeness of well-known entertainer Curtis Jackson (a/k/a \"50 Cent\") and his mark \"G-Unit\" (short for \"Guerilla Unit,\" the nom de guerre of Jackson's hip-hop group). <i>Id.</i> at *25. As for damages under the statute, the district court observed that the \"reasonable royalty measure of damages is taken to mean more than simply a percentage of actual profits. The measure now, very simply, means the actual <i>value</i> of what has been appropriated.\" <i>Id.</i> at *30-31 (emphasis supplied) (quoting <i>University Computing Co. v. Lykes-Youngstown Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"322275\"><a href=\"/opinion/322275/university-computing-company-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 537 (5th Cir.1974)). To ascertain what that \"value\" was, the district court turned to basic principles of Florida's law of damages: \"The fundamental principle of the law of damages is that the person injured... shall have fair and just compensation commensurate with the loss sustained in consequence of the defendant's act which gives rise to the action.\" <i>Id.</i> at *35-36 (quoting <i>MCI WorldCom Network Servs. v. Mastec, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1697954\"><a href=\"/opinion/1697954/mci-worldcom-network-services-inc-v-mastec-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 224 (Fla. 2008)). Framework in place, the district court determined that a lump-sum payment of $200,000 was a reasonable royalty for Coco Bongo's misappropriation. <i>Id.</i> at *36.</p>\n<p>Ji argues that the district court's $200,000 award in <i>Jackson</i> was \"based on $4,654,846 in salesa 4.3% royalty rate.\" Not true. Nowhere in its analysis of damages under § 540.08 did the district court mention, let alone consider, Coco Bongo's sales. <i>See id.</i> at 35-42. It only did so in calculating damages on Jackson's successful Lanham Act claim. <i>Id.</i> at 42 (\"[Jackson] is entitled to an award of profits for the infringing use of his trademark <i>only.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> <i>Compare 15 U.S.C. 1117, with Section 540.08, Fla. Stat.</i>\") (first emphasis supplied). Here, unlike in <i>Jackson,</i> Ji's Lanham Act claim was dismissed on summary judgment.</p>\n<p>For similar reasons, Ji's reliance on the court's statement in <i>Jackson,</i> quoted above, that a reasonable royalty means \"more than simply a percentage of actual profits,\" is mistaken. <i>Id.</i> at *30 (quoting <i>University Computing,</i> 504 F.2d at 537). \"Judges expect their pronunciamentos to be read in context.\" <i>In re Olympic Mills,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202596\"><a href=\"/opinion/202596/siaca-v-dcc-operating-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>Wisehart v.

The fallacy in Ji's argument is readily apparent. If the court in <i>Jackson</i> meant that profits were a component of a reasonable royalty, then why did it disregard Coco Bongo's profits (which were in the record) when it determined damages under § 540.08? Ji offers no reasonable explanation for this discrepancy.</p>\n<p>Ji's analogy to patent law measures of damages suffers a similar, but much quicker, fate. Whatever the variety of approaches under patent law, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>University Computing,</i> 504 F.2d at 536-39, the language of the federal statute is different and there is no basis to assume that § 540.08 was meant to have the same meaning.</p>\n<p>All in all, it is enough that Ji has failed to submit reliable indicia that the Florida Supreme Court would consider sales data as necessary components of a reasonable royalty under § 540.08. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in compelling Bose to produce usage data instead.</p>\n<p>If we had any doubts about this conclusion (we do not), Ji's failure to show prejudice resulting from the district court's order would remove them. As discussed, the district court ordered Bose to tell Ji the \"number of unit boxes on which her image appeared.\" Bose thereafter told Ji, via a supplemental interrogatory response, that Ji's image appeared on approximately 206,000 units of the 321 System. Based on that data point, and record evidence that the 321 System sold for $999 per unit, Ji's expert witness, Richard Wolfe, an attorney specializing in entertainment law, was able to extrapolate that Bose's gross revenues from the 321 System were as high as about $206 million. Applying a rate of between a half percent and one percent of that figure, Wolfe testified at trial that in his opinion a reasonable \"usage fee\" (which he equated with a \"royalty\") would be between $1 million and $2 million.<sup>[5]</sup> At closing, Ji's counsel, specifically referencing Wolfe's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> testimony, argued that the jury should award Ji a $2 million fee based on a one-percent rate.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Ji argues that although Wolfe was able to extrapolate maximum potential revenues based on the number of units Bose packaged, he could not determine actual revenues without knowing how many of those units Bose sold. This is, of course, true. But this could not have prejudiced Ji. The number of units Bose sold would have to be equal to or, more likely, less than the number of units Bose packaged. Therefore, the usage fee Ji's expert recommended was the upper end of a range based on what actual revenues could have been. Actual revenues were probably less, but Bose (perhaps against its interest) did not object and the jury was free to agree with Wolfe.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Jury Instructions</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Ji proposed the following two instructions, and others, to the district court:</p>\n<blockquote>[Proposed Jury Instruction No. 22:] If you find for the Plaintiff on her claims for violation of right to publicity, you should award Plaintiff an amount of money that the preponderance of the evidence shows will fairly and adequately compensate Plaintiff for the damages she has sustained by virtue of Bose's appropriation and exploitation of Plaintiff's image without her express consent. If you find that the Plaintiff has been injured by Bose in violation of her rights under Florida Statute § 540.08, she is entitled to receive damages from Bose which may include a reasonable royalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Proposed Jury Instruction No. 23:] A \"royalty\" can be established several different ways. One method of establishing a royalty is by the total amount of the [<i>sic</i>] Bose's profits resulting from its exploitation of Plaintiff's image.</blockquote>\n<p>At the charge conference, the district court stated that it would deliver the substance of proposed instruction 22 but not 23:</p>\n<blockquote>I will give the substance of 22. However, Bose's objections have been noted, and the instructions will certainly be consistent with this Court's prior rulings. On No. 23, I am not going to give that. We'll tell the jury about what compensatory damages are but not how to calculate them.</blockquote>\n<p>Ji's counsel did not object.</p>\n<p>The next day, the district court instructed the jury on damages as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> If you find that [Ji] has proved her claim of a violation of her right to publicity, you may award her damages for any injury suffered as a result of that violation. That means that you must determine how much the plaintiff would have been paid for the uses to which Bose eventually put her image, which is referred to in the law as \"compensatory damages.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The object of compensatory damages is to award the plaintiff the equivalent in money to any losses that she suffered. That requires you to consider all of the evidence and determine what would have been a fair value for the way that Bose eventually used the plaintiff's photographs.</blockquote>\n<p>At sidebar, before the case was sent to the jury, Ji's counsel objected to neither the district court's instruction as delivered nor its omission of proposed instruction 23.</p>\n<p>Bose argues that Ji's failures to object result in waiver, or, alternatively, forfeiture of her instructional challenge.</p>\n<p>The failure to object promptly and properly to an instruction generally forfeits an appellant's right to object on appeal. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Astro-Med, Inc. v. Nihon Kohden Am., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204041\"><a href=\"/opinion/204041/astro-med-inc-v-nihon-kohden-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">591</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2009) (\"Defendants did not object to the instruction and they therefore forfeited their right to object on appeal.\"); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c)(1) (\"A party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so on the record, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection.\"); Fed. R.Civ.P. 51(c)(2)(B) (a party must \"object[] promptly after learning that the instruction or request will be, or has been, given or refused\"). \"Our interpretation of Rule 51 is quite strict.\" <i>Astro-Med,</i> 591 F.3d at 20 (quoting <i>Connelly v.

Forfeited objections may be reviewed for plain error only. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Ji counters with a single argument. She urges us to recognize, as some circuits have done, a judge-created exception to Rule 51: that a party need not object when doing so would have been \"futile and unavailing.\" <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gulliford v. Pierce County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751753\"><a href=\"/opinion/751753/herbert-gulliford-v-pierce-county-a-municipality-and-governmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1345</span></a></span>, 1348 (9th Cir.1998) (\"Where the district court is aware of the party's concerns with an instruction, and further objection would be unavailing, we will not require a futile formal objection.\"). According to Ji, an objection would have been pointless because the district court was well aware of her position on damages in light of earlier motion practice.</p>\n<p>We have in the past rejected similar attempts to excuse a party's failure to object. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Elliott v.

We did so, most recently, in <i>Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199969\"><a href=\"/opinion/199969/gray-v-genlyte-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 134 (1st Cir.), <i>reh'g denied,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779417\"><a href=\"/opinion/779417/linda-gray-v-genlyte-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2002) (denying rehearing en banc despite urging to recognize a futility exception to Rule 51).</p>\n<p>In light of our precedent, our review of this claim is for plain error. <i>Torres-Rivera v. O'Neill-Cancel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201560\"><a href=\"/opinion/201560/torres-rivera-v-oneill-cancel/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 50 (1st Cir.2005). \"To obtain relief under this standard, the party claiming error must show (1) an error, (2) that is plain (<i>i.e.,</i> obvious and clear under current law) (3) that is likely to alter the outcome, and (4) that is sufficiently fundamental to threaten the fairness or integrity or public reputation of the judicial process.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Connelly,</i> 351 F.3d at 545) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"The requirement that the error is likely to alter the outcome is particularly important in this context because `[a]n erroneous jury instruction necessitates a new trial only if the error could have affected the result of the jury's deliberations.'\" <i>Colon-Millin,</i> 455 F.3d at 41 (quoting <i>Allen v. Chance Mfg.

The district court's decision to omit Ji's proposed instruction 23that a royalty can constitute a percentage of saleswas not plain error for the same reasons that its decision to order Bose to produce usage data in lieu of sales data was not an abuse of discretion. See <i>supra</i> Part II.A.1. Even if the omission were plain error (it was not), Ji has not shown that it likely altered the jury's damages award. As discussed, Ji's testifying expert, Wolfe, extrapolated Bose's revenues and opined that a reasonable usage fee in this case could be as high as $2 million based on a one-percent rate. See <i>supra</i> Part II.A.1. The damages instruction that the district court delivered charging the jury \"to consider all of the evidence and determine what would have been a fair value for the way that Bose eventually used the plaintiff's photographs\"compelled the jury to consider, rather than disregard, Wolfe's testimony. In this light, we struggle to see the probability that an additional instruction that royalties are sometimes calculated on the basis of sales would have resulted in a higher damages award.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>We also think Ji's proposed instruction 22, <i>supra,</i> undermines her general critique that the district court misunderstood damages under § 540.08 as compensatory in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> nature. Proposed instruction 22 specifically requested an instruction on compensatory damages (\"you should award Plaintiff an amount of money that ... will fairly and adequately compensate Plaintiff for the damages she has sustained\") and was substantially similar to the instruction that the district court delivered.</p>\n<p>In sum, Ji has not shown that the district court's order partially granting her motion to compel constituted an abuse of discretion. Nor has she shown that the district court's omission of her proposed instruction constituted plain error or that it likely altered the damages award. A new trial on damages is therefore unwarranted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Challenge to Summary Judgment Denial</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In their cross-appeals, Bose and White argue that trial on Ji's right-to-publicity and privacy claims should never have taken place in the first instance. They argue that the district court should have granted their motions for summary judgment on what they contend was a pure legal issue: whether the Voucher or the Release controlled. If the Voucher was unenforceable, as they claim, then the Release controlled and through it Ji relinquished all rights to her images.</p>\n<p>We do not reach the merits of their argument because neither Bose nor White properly preserved it in a motion for judgment as a matter of law.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Generally, the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not reviewable after a full trial and final judgment on the merits. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Eastern Mt. Platform Tennis, Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"682731\"><a href=\"/opinion/682731/eastern-mountain-platform-tennis-inc-v-the-sherwin-williams-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 500 (1st Cir.1994); <i>Lama v.

It is not a judgment, and does not foreclose trial on issues on which summary judgment was sought.'\" <i>Sherwin-Williams,</i> 40 F.3d at 500 (quoting <i>Glaros v. H.H. Robertson Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474543\"><a href=\"/opinion/474543/emanuel-m-glaros-appellantcross-appellee-v-hh-robertson-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1564</span></a></span>, 1573 (Fed.Cir.1986)). Thus, in order to preserve its challenge for appeal, a disappointed party must restate its objection in a motion for judgment as a matter of law (\"JMOL\"). <i>See id.</i> at 497; <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 50. If that too is unsuccessful, then the propriety of the district court's denial of JMOL is reviewable on appeal from final judgment. <i>Sherwin-Williams,</i> 40 F.3d at 497.</p>\n<p>We have not recognized an exception to this rule, as some circuits have done, when a party's challenge is based on a circumscribed legal error, as opposed to an error concerning the existence of fact issues.<sup>[9]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> Instead, our rule is that even legal errors cannot be reviewed unless the challenging party restates its objection in a motion for JMOL. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rivera-Torres v.

White moved on the former ground only. Following the verdict, Bose orally renewed its motion for JMOL \"with regard to liability.\"<sup>[10]</sup> White did the same. But at no point did either Bose or White restate their challenge that the Voucher was unenforceable as a matter of law. Accordingly, we deem that challenge waived.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Attorneys' Fees</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Bose argues that the district court should have granted its motion for attorneys' fees. According to Bose, Ji's Lanham Act claim was fabricated, entirely groundless, and nothing more than a ruse \"to gain access to Bose's sensitive financial data in the hope of forcing an exorbitant settlement.\" Bose contends that the district court failed to give sufficient weight to these factors and therefore abused its discretion by denying Bose's motion.</p>\n<p>We review the denial of a motion for attorneys' fees for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>Boston's Children First v.

In doing so, we \"confine our review to whether the district court has made a mistake of law or incorrectly weighed (or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> failed to weigh) a factor in its decision.\" <i>Richardson v. Miller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199797\"><a href=\"/opinion/199797/richardson-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.2002). We review <i>de novo</i> the legal question of the meaning of \"exceptional cases\" under the Lanham Act. <i>Visible Sys. Corp. v. Unisys Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203606\"><a href=\"/opinion/203606/visible-systems-corp-v-unisys-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 81 (1st Cir.2008). For present purposes, we assume without deciding that Bose is a \"prevailing party\" under the Lanham Act. 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a) (providing for attorneys' fees to \"the prevailing party\").</p>\n<p>The Lanham Act provides for attorneys' fees only in \"exceptional cases.\" <i>Id.</i> We have yet to construe this criterion in the context of a prevailing <i>defendant. Cf. </i><i>Tamko Roofing Prod., Inc. v. Ideal Roofing, Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2002) (construing criterion in context of prevailing plaintiff, and holding that \"[i]n exceptional cases, attorneys' fees may be appropriate in circumstances where the acts of infringement were malicious, fraudulent, deliberate, or willful\" or \"when equitable considerations justify such awards\") (quoting S. Rep. 93-1400, at 5, 6 (1974), 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7132, 7133, 7137) (internal quotation marks omitted). And we need not do so today: here, both parties agree that the standard applied by the district courtrequiring \"something less than ... bad faith,\" such as a \"plaintiff's use of groundless arguments, failure to cite controlling law and generally oppressive nature of the case\"was correct. For purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that this is true.</p>\n<p>Under this standard, the district court's decision to deny attorneys' fees under § 1117(a) was well within the bounds of its discretion. Although Ji's Lanham Act claim was defeated on summary judgment, her claim was not entirely unfounded. As the district court observed, Ji met her summary judgment burden of showing both similarity of likeness and similarity of marketing channels, two of the factors used to assess the likelihood of consumer confusion under the Lanham Act.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Ji's motion practice concerning her routine discovery requests similarly fails to satisfy the Lanham Act's exceptionality criterion. There is nothing particularly oppressive about attempting to discover financial information in connection with an intellectual property dispute. Although Ji initially sought that information vis-a-vis her Lanham Act claim, once that claim was dismissed she requested it again in order to prove damages under § 540.08. On that theory, the district court ultimately compelled Bose to produce some of the information Ji requested, and she used that information at trial. See <i>supra</i> Part II.A.1. We see no evidence in the record that Ji sought or employed that information for some ulterior purpose.</p>\n<p>The inaccuracies in Ji's verified complaint, much touted by Bose as evidence of perfidiousness, are unfortunateeven sloppybut they do not rise to the level of improper conduct necessary to show that this case is exceptional. Many of the examples Bose provides are jejune; others merely aggrandize Ji's status in immaterial ways. This, without more, is not enough.</p>\n<p>The district court also properly rejected Bose's request for fees under § 1927. In <i>Jensen v. Phillips Screw Co.,</i> we held that the plain language of § 1927 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> sanctions unreasonable <i>multiplication,</i> and not <i>commencement,</i> of proceedings: \"Congress's use of the verb `multipl[y]' in the text of the statute clearly contemplates that, to be sanctionable thereunder, conduct must have an effect on an already initiated proceeding.... [A] lawyer cannot violate section 1927 in the course of commencing an action.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203547\"><a href=\"/opinion/203547/jensen-v-phillips-screw-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir.2008). For this reason, we refused to sanction an attorney under § 1927 for failing \"to vet [his client] or investigate the bona fides of his claim.\" <i>Jensen,</i> 546 F.3d at 65. Here, because Bose's argument is based solely on the failure of Ji's counsel to vet the representations in her verified complaint, fees under § 1927 are foreclosed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i> The parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The district court issued a posttrial order finding no violation of Chapter 93A as to either Bose or White. Ji has not appealed that ruling.</p>\n<p>[2]  The first question on the verdict form asked the jury whether Bose violated Ji's publicity <i>or</i> privacy rights under Florida law and required a yes-or-no answer. The jury foreman checked the \"yes\" box. The second question asked the jury to enter an amount of damages proved as a result of Bose's violation of Ji's right to publicity <i>or</i> its invasion of her privacy <i>or</i> both. The jury foreman wrote \"$10,000.\"\n</p>\n<p>Based on the verdict form's use of the disjunctive, it is possible that the jury determined that there was no violation of Fla. Stat. § 540.08, and awarded damages on Ji's common-law privacy claim only. Whether this possibility impacts our review of the measure of damages available under § 540.08 is an issue that the parties do not address. Because the parties agreed below that both claims turned on the same question (whether Ji consented to the use of her images), and because we will never know the exact basis of the jury's determination, we proceed to address the parties' dispute anyway.</p>\n<p>[3]  Notably, Ji does not argue on appeal that the jury's $10,000 damages award was unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p>[4]  Of course, decisions of federal trial courts interpreting state law are not binding on state courts (or on federal appellate courts attempting to divine how a state court might rule).</p>\n<p>[5]  Because Ji hotly contests this point, we provide excerpts from Wolfe's trial testimony:\n</p>\n<p>[Ji's Counsel:] [B]ased on your experience with these different types of usages, can you describe for us the different types of compensation that you have seen models receive for these different usages?</p>\n<p>[Wolfe:] Sure. And, again, it ranges the gamut, and it also depends upon the stature of the model and it depends upon the intended use by the ultimate user.... [W]here the image is going to be used for a commercial purpose ... we're typically going to negotiate for a flat fee for the model's time to take the photos, and that <i>we would negotiate an ongoing fee, sometimes called a royalty, which would be commensurate with the uses by the user of the image</i>....</p>\n<p>[Ji's Counsel:] [D]o you have an idea of the numerical circulation of my client's picture by Bose?</p>\n<p>[Wolfe:] Yes.</p>\n<p>[Ji's Counsel:] And what is that understanding?</p>\n<p>[Wolfe:] That the picture was used on the product approximately 206,000 times....</p>\n<p>[Ji's Counsel:] Based on your experience in negotiating compensation packages for modeling agencies and their models, do you have an opinion as to the compensation to which a model whose image is used on $206 million worth of merchandise might be entitled?</p>\n<p>[Wolfe:] I do.</p>\n<p>[Ji's Counsel:] What is that opinion? ...</p>\n<p>[Wolfe:] [B]ased on my experience, I would negotiate for one-half of one percent to one percent, and if you take 206,000 uses at $999 at the low end of the scale, you're at approximately <i>$1 million is a reasonable utilization and a reasonable compensation to the model at the low end, and at the high end, I would say $2 million at the one percent.</i></p>\n<p>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p>[6]  For the same reason, we provide an excerpt from Ji's counsel's closing argument:\n</p>\n<p>Let me tell you how we believe that you [the jury] should [determine damages]. We believe that you should follow the testimony, which was unchallenged, by Mr. Wolfe, who stated his experience with modeling agencies and models, and <i>he clearly told you that a reasonable fee would be a usage fee,</i> and I know it's large, but that is based on $206 million worth of commercial boxes. <i>He said usage fees are the way that models like Ms. Ji are compensated</i>.... From Mr. Wolfe, he's basically looked at the situation, and <i>he said that a fee of one-half to one percent, one-half to one percent of the unauthorized use of her image on $206 million worth of merchandise would be a fair and reasonable fee.</i> She's not a celebrity, she's not a top model, but Mr. Wolfe said that someone in a like situation, someone who usedthey used their image in unauthorized ways, <i>a reasonable usage fee would be between $1 million and $2 million.</i></p>\n<p>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p>[7]  Rule 51 was amended in 2003, subsequent to our opinion in <i>Gray,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199969\"><a href=\"/opinion/199969/gray-v-genlyte-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, to provide that \"[a] party may assign as error... a failure to give an instruction, if that party properly requested it and<i>unless the court rejected the request in a definitive ruling on the record</i>also properly objected.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 51(d)(1)(B) (emphasis supplied). But Ji neither relies on nor even references the amended rule. <i>Faigin v. Kelly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198558\"><a href=\"/opinion/198558/faigin-v-kelly-carucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"When put to his mettle, it is the appellant's burden to establish that he has preserved such a claim of [instructional] error.\"); <i>see </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[A] litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold its peace\") (quoting <i>Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504001\"><a href=\"/opinion/504001/martin-rivera-gomez-v-rafael-adolfo-de-castro/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span>, 635 (1st Cir.1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n</p>\n<p>Even if we were to consider Ji's challenge preserved under Rule 51(d)(1)(B) and thus subject to <i>de novo</i> review, the challenge would nevertheless fail. It is hornbook law that a properly preserved objection to the failure to give a requested jury instruction \"constitutes reversible error only if it was prejudicial in light of the entire record.\" <i>United States v. Buttrick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201935\"><a href=\"/opinion/201935/united-states-v-buttrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>, 376 (1st Cir.2005). Here, as explained above, the omission of Ji's royalty instruction did not prejudice her in light of Wolfe's extensive testimony about an appropriate usage fee and the district court's charge that the jury must consider that evidence in assessing damages.</p>\n<p>[8]  For the identical reason, we do not reach the merits of White's separate claim that the district court erred in denying White summary judgment on Bose's claims against it for breach of contract, misrepresentation, indemnification, and contribution.</p>\n<p>[9]  At least two other circuits have excused explicitly the failure to move for JMOL and have reviewed the challenge anyway if it was based on a purported legal error. <i>See </i><i>Chemetall GMBH v. ZR Energy, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780980\"><a href=\"/opinion/780980/chemetall-gmbh-v-zr-energy-inc-joseph-t-fraval-and-arnold-berkovitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span>, 720 (7th Cir.2003); <i>accord </i><i>Ruyle v. Continental Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686552\"><a href=\"/opinion/686552/robert-ruyle-and-elizabeth-ruyle-harvey-fransen-and-marjorie-fransen-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 841 (10th Cir.1994). While this split may be resolved by the Supreme Court, <i>see </i><i>Ortiz v. Jordan,</i> 316 Fed. Appx. 449 (6th Cir.2009), <i>cert. granted,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2371</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span></span> (U.S. Apr. 26, 2010) (No. 09-737), we are bound by our precedents until the Supreme Court says otherwise. <i>United States v. Holloway,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202916\"><a href=\"/opinion/202916/united-states-v-holloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></a></span>, 118 (1st Cir.2007) (\"it is axiomatic that new panels are bound by prior panel decisions in the absence of supervening authority\").</p>\n<p>[10]  Although seemingly broad, the word \"liability\" as used in Bose's renewed motion for JMOL cannot encompass the challenge that the Voucher was unenforceable because that ground was not articulated in its earlier motion for JMOL. <i>Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196369\"><a href=\"/opinion/196369/correa-gonzalez-v-hospital-sf/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1196 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"The movant cannot use [a renewed motion for JMOL] as a vehicle to introduce a legal theory not distinctly articulated in its close-of-the-evidence motion for [JMOL].\").</p>\n<p>[11]  We realize that the Supreme Court may address this issue in <i>Ortiz.</i> See <i>supra</i> note 9. We wish to add, therefore, that Bose's and White's challenge to summary judgment denial would be unreviewable even if it were not waived. Although Bose and White contend that their challenge presents a discrete legal issue, a fair reading of the record reveals that Bose and White sought resolution of conflicting factual inferences from competing contracts and deposition testimony surrounding their creation. This is evident in (1) the district court's rescript, which found that the parties' proffered evidence made it \"abundantly clear\" that \"there is a genuine issue of material fact which must be resolved by a jury,\" and (2) the parties' appellate briefs, which refer extensively to conflicting deposition and trial testimony as evidence of the parties' intentions. <i>See </i><i>Chesapeake Paper Prods. Co. v. Stone &amp; Webster Eng'g Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"693386\"><a href=\"/opinion/693386/chesapeake-paper-products-company-successor-in-interest-to-chesapeake/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1229</span></a></span>, 1235-36 (4th Cir.1995) (refusing to review summary judgment denial based on ambiguity in competing contract documentation). Because we agree with the district court that fact issues precluded summary judgment, Bose's and White's challenge falls under the general prohibition against reviewing summary judgment denials after a full trial and final judgment on the merits.</p>\n<p>[12]  At oral argument, Bose's counsel asserted that the district court improperly considered the ultimate success of Ji's other claims in determining whether to award attorneys' fees on Ji's unsuccessful Lanham Act claim. We do not read the district court's rescript quite that way, but in any event we do not reach the matter because Bose did not raise this argument in its briefs. <i>Piazza v. Aponte Roque,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545208\"><a href=\"/opinion/545208/magda-marin-piazza-v-awilda-aponte-roque/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[A] court of appeals will not consider an issue raised for the first time at oral argument.\").</p>\n\n</div>",
