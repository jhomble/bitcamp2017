Petitioners Vjollca Dine (\"Dine\")\n\nand her husband, Vasil Treska (\"Treska\"), seek review of a decision\n\nof the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirming the denial of\n\ntheir   application   for    asylum,         withholding    of    removal,    and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").                      The\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\") specifically noted that he found Treska\n\nand his daughter, Krisida Treska (\"Krisida\"), not to be credible\n\nwitnesses.      The   BIA   upheld       the    IJ's   adverse        credibility\n\ndeterminations; it also affirmed the IJ's conclusion that Treska\n\nand Dine failed to establish a nexus between the events in question\n\nand a statutorily protected ground under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42).\n\nWe affirm the BIA and deny the petition for review.\n\n                                       I.\n\n           On   September   18,   1994,       petitioners     Dine    and   Treska\n\nattempted to enter the United States with Albanian passports and\n\nnon-immigrant    visas.     In    an    interview      with      an   immigration\n\ninspector, Treska stated that he was not making any claim to United\n\nStates citizenship and that he was visiting for the purpose of\n\nattending his brother's wedding. Treska and Dine were denied entry\n\nand placed into exclusion proceedings.           On November 18, 1994, they\n\nadmitted excludability, and on December 30, 1994, they filed an\n\napplication for asylum and withholding of removal, claiming past\n\npersecution on the basis of religion, nationality, and political\n\nopinion.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            At the exclusion proceedings on June 30, 1995, Treska\n\ntestified to his being Christian Orthodox, ethnic Romanian, and a\n\nmember of the Democratic Party in Albania.               He reported that his\n\nfather's bakery had been taken over by the government in 1967, that\n\nMuslims    made   up    the   majority    of   the   government   and   received\n\npreferential treatment, and that Christians had been kept from\n\nrebuilding the church in his hometown.           Dine did not testify at the\n\nexclusion proceedings.\n\n            On June 14, 1996, the IJ issued an oral decision denying\n\nthe petitioners' application for asylum and withholding of removal.\n\nThe IJ concluded that the applicants \"ha[d] not met their burden of\n\nestablishing that if they were to return to Albania that they\n\nw[ould] be persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution\"\n\non account of one of the five statutorily protected grounds.1\n\nTreska and Dine appealed this decision, and the BIA dismissed the\n\nappeal on May 15, 2001.\n\n            Shortly thereafter, the petitioners' daughter, Krisida,\n\narrived in the United States on September 8, 2001, having presented\n\nherself for admission under the Visa Waiver Pilot Program under a\n\ndifferent name.        Immigration authorities intercepted and detained\n\nher.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          The statutorily protected grounds are \"race, religion,\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, [and]\npolitical opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).\n\n                                         -3-\n\f            On October 11, 2001, Treska and Dine filed a motion with\n\nthe BIA to reopen or reconsider its decision of May 15, 2001, on\n\ngrounds that \"country conditions in Albania had significantly\n\nchanged since the [petitioners] escaped from [there].\"             Treska and\n\nDine also submitted a second application, dated October 1, 2001,\n\nseeking asylum and withholding of removal, as well as protection\n\nunder the CAT.    The government did not oppose the motion to reopen,\n\nand on November 30, 2001, the BIA granted the motion and ordered\n\nfurther proceedings before the IJ.\n\n            On July 6, 2004, Treska and his daughter, Krisida,\n\ntestified about events on which the petitioners' persecution claims\n\nwere based.    Neither witness testified about the changed country\n\nconditions that originally formed the basis for the petitioners'\n\nmotion to reopen; instead, each testified about a kidnapping and\n\nthreats against Krisida while she was living in Albania.                  The\n\npetitioners claimed that the kidnapping and threats were the direct\n\nresult of their financial donations to the Democratic Party of\n\nAlbania.\n\n            Treska testified that in May or June 2001, Dine sent\n\n$2,000 to her parents in Albania so that they could give the money\n\nto the Democratic Party.     According to Treska, Dine's parents did\n\nso,   and   Dine's   contribution   was   later   mentioned   at    a   public\n\ndemonstration.       After this announcement, Treska's parents, who\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fremained in Albania, started receiving threats and insulting phone\n\ncalls.\n\n            Treska also testified that on July 15, 2001, Treska's\n\nmother received an anonymous letter requiring her to pay $15,000 by\n\nJuly 20, 2001; if she did not deliver the money, Krisida would\n\n\"disappear.\"2 Treska explained that his mother reported the letter\n\nto the police, but the police gave \"a negative response\" because\n\nshe was unable to tell them who had sent the letter in the first\n\nplace.   Treska and Dine decided that Krisida should stay with\n\nDine's uncle in a nearby town.       Treska testified that he and his\n\nwife sent $15,000 to Albania with somebody who was traveling from\n\nthe United States to Albania.      The money arrived in Albania on July\n\n22, 2001.     That same morning, Krisida was abducted by two men\n\nwearing masks while she was playing outside her uncle's home.\n\nAccording   to   Treska,   the   $15,000   eventually   reached   Treska's\n\nmother, who then personally delivered the ransom in exchange for\n\nKrisida's return on July 23, 2001.\n\n            Treska then testified that on August 27, 2001, his mother\n\nreceived another letter, this time demanding $10,000 or else\n\nKrisida would be killed. The letter indicated that payment was due\n\nby September 5.     Instead of paying the ransom, Treska's mother\n\narranged Krisida's departure to the United States.         Treska stated\n\n\n     2\n          The letter, translated into English, threatened to kidnap\n\"[y]our niece,\" apparently referring to Krisida, who was living\nwith her grandparents at the time.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthat the kidnappers threatened his mother when they found out that\n\nKrisida had left the country, but he also reported that no actual\n\nharm had come to her.\n\n          Krisida testified that she was eleven years old at the\n\ntime of her kidnapping.     She reported that she was playing outside\n\nher uncle's house just before she was kidnapped.            Two masked men\n\njumped out of a car and grabbed her, and then took her by car to\n\nthe basement of an old house.       When it was dark outside, the men\n\ncame back and drove Krisida to her grandmother's house.              Krisida\n\ntestified that the men \"left [her] at the end of the street\" and\n\nthat she walked to the house by herself.         She made clear that upon\n\nher return, her grandmother did not speak with her abductors or\n\ngive them anything.\n\n          After the hearing, the IJ issued an oral decision denying\n\nTreska's and Dine's application for asylum, withholding of removal,\n\nand relief under the CAT.      The IJ found neither Treska nor Krisida\n\nto be credible, citing their demeanor in court and inconsistencies\n\nin   Treska's   testimony     relative     to   Krisida's   testimony   and\n\ndocumentary evidence.     Furthermore, the IJ found no nexus between\n\nthe alleged kidnapping and one of the five statutorily protected\n\ngrounds, commenting that there was no evidence as to the motives of\n\nthe kidnappers. With respect to the asylum and withholding claims,\n\nthe IJ concluded that Treska and Dine had failed to demonstrate\n\neither   past   persecution    or   a     well-founded   fear   of    future\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fpersecution.      With respect to the CAT claims, the IJ found that\n\nTreska and Dine had failed to show that torture would be \"inflicted\n\nby or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of\n\na public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\"\n\nTreska and Dine appealed to the BIA.\n\n           On December 22, 2005, the BIA dismissed the petitioners'\n\nappeal.    The     BIA        affirmed     the        IJ's    adverse   credibility\n\ndeterminations as well as his conclusion that Treska and Dine\n\nfailed to establish a nexus between Krisida's kidnapping and a\n\nprotected ground.        Treska and Dine now petition for review by this\n\ncourt.\n\n                                          II.\n\n           The petitioners challenge the IJ's adverse credibility\n\ndeterminations as well as his finding that there was no nexus\n\nbetween Krisida's kidnapping and their political views.                   They also\n\nargue that they must prevail on their asylum claims because an IJ\n\nin a different proceeding granted Krisida asylum on identical\n\nfacts.3      Because     we    hold    that     the    IJ's   adverse   credibility\n\ndeterminations were supported by substantial evidence, we deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n           In immigration cases, our review is deferential with\n\nrespect   to     findings      of     fact,   including       the   credibility   of\n\nwitnesses.     See Chen v. Gonzales, 418 F.3d 110, 113 (1st Cir.\n\n\n     3\n           Krisida's asylum claim was granted on March 11, 2005.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f2005); Singh v. Gonzales, 413 F.3d 156, 159 (1st Cir. 2005).            We\n\nmust affirm factual findings if they are \"supported by reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.\"   INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (quoting\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a)(4)) (internal quotation marks omitted).             Put\n\nanother way, the factual finding must stand \"unless any reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\"             8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).\n\n            In this latest round of proceedings, Dine and Treska\n\nsought asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT\n\nbased on the claim that their daughter, while still in Albania, was\n\nthreatened and abducted because of their political views. However,\n\nthe IJ found Treska's and Krisida's testimony to be incredible, and\n\nhe   supported   this   determination   with   a   number   of   subsidiary\n\nfindings.    For example, the IJ found it highly suspect that the\n\npetitioners decided at their hearing to focus entirely on Krisida's\n\nkidnapping, even though their motion to reopen proceedings -- which\n\nwas filed on October 5, 2001, after the alleged abduction -- made\n\nno mention of the $2,000 payment to the Democratic Party of\n\nAlbania, the public announcement of the donation, the threatened\n\nkidnapping, the actual kidnapping, the ransom payment, or the\n\ndemand for additional payment.      When asked during the proceeding\n\nwhy these events were not recounted in the motion to reopen, Treska\n\nexplained that he and his wife filed the motion through a different\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fattorney and that they had in fact explained these events to him.\n\nTreska was unclear, however, about whether the previous attorney\n\nhad gone over the contents of the motion to reopen with him and his\n\nwife, first appearing to say \"yes\" and then later saying \"no.\"\n\n            The IJ also found it highly suspect that the events in\n\nquestion   all     happened     shortly    after    the   BIA's   denial   of   the\n\npetitioners' appeal on May 15, 2001. Indeed, Treska testified that\n\nDine had sent the $2,000 to her mother in May or June 2001.                      By\n\nearly September 2001, the petitioners' daughter had arrived in the\n\nUnited States, and in October 2001, they filed their petition to\n\nreopen.\n\n            Furthermore,        the   IJ    noted    inconsistencies       between\n\nTreska's testimony and the documentary evidence before the court.\n\nIn particular, the IJ was concerned by Treska's testimony that the\n\nsecond threat against his daughter occurred on August 27, 2001; a\n\npolice    record    with   an   authenticated       signature     indicates     that\n\nTreska's mother reported the second threat on July 27, 2001.                    When\n\nconfronted with this discrepancy, Treska suggested that the police\n\nreport could have contained a typographical error, an explanation\n\nthat the IJ found unconvincing.\n\n            The IJ additionally took issue with Treska's evasiveness\n\nwhen asked how he received one of the ransom notes, as well as with\n\nhis non-responsiveness when the government asked exactly how he\n\ntransported $15,000 in cash to Albania. The IJ noted that Treska's\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fparents continue to live unharmed in Albania, despite the threats\n\nhis mother reportedly received after Krisida's departure for the\n\nUnited States.      Furthermore, the IJ highlighted the discrepancies\n\nbetween Treska's testimony and Krisida's testimony regarding the\n\ncircumstances of Krisida's return to Treska's mother's house.\n\n            The IJ provided \"specific, cogent reason[s] for [his]\n\ndisbelief,\" Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 47 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(quoting Turcios v. INS, 821 F.2d 1396, 1399 (9th Cir. 1987))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted), and we cannot say that either\n\nthe IJ or the BIA erred in finding the testimony of Treska and\n\nKrisida incredible.\n\n            The    adverse    credibility         determinations     defeat   the\n\npetitioners'      asylum    claims.     We    have    noted   that    \"[w]hen   a\n\npetitioner's case depends on the veracity of . . . testimony, a\n\nfully supported adverse credibility determination, without more,\n\ncan sustain a denial of asylum.\"        Olujoke v. Gonzáles, 411 F.3d 16,\n\n22 (1st Cir. 2005).        This is such a case.       The petitioners' claims\n\ndepend on the veracity of the testimony given by Treska and his\n\ndaughter,    Krisida.         In   light     of    the   adverse     credibility\n\ndeterminations, we hold that there is substantial evidence to\n\nsupport the conclusion that Treska and Dine failed to show either\n\npast persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\n            Our affirmance of the denial of petitioners' asylum\n\nclaims effectively disposes of their withholding of removal claims.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fSee Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"A claim\n\nfor withholding of deportation demands that the alien carry a more\n\nstringent burden of proof than does an asylum claim.          Thus, if an\n\nalien     cannot   establish   asylum    eligibility,   his   claim   for\n\nwithholding of deportation fails a fortiori.\").\n\n            Because the petitioners' brief does not advance any\n\narguments regarding the CAT, we deem that these claims have been\n\nwaived.    See Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 28 n.5 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f",

The petitioners claimed that the kidnapping and threats were the direct result of their financial donations to the Democratic Party of Albania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treska testified that in May or June 2001, Dine sent $2,000 to her parents in Albania so that they could give the money to the Democratic Party. According to Treska, Dine's parents did so, and Dine's contribution was later mentioned at a public demonstration. After this announcement, Treska's parents, who remained in Albania, started receiving threats and insulting phone calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treska also testified that on July 15, 2001, Treska's mother received an anonymous letter requiring her to pay $15,000 by July 20, 2001; if she did not deliver the money, Krisida would \"disappear.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Treska explained that his mother reported the letter to the police, but the police gave \"a negative response\" because she was unable to tell them who had sent the letter in the first place. Treska and Dine decided that Krisida should stay with Dine's uncle in a nearby town. Treska testified that he and his wife sent $15,000 to Albania with somebody who was traveling from the United States to Albania. The money arrived in Albania on July 22, 2001. That same morning, Krisida was abducted by two men wearing masks while she was playing outside her uncle's home. According to Treska, the $15,000 eventually reached Treska's mother, who then personally delivered the ransom in exchange for Krisida's return on July 23, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treska then testified that on August 27, 2001, his mother received another letter, this time demanding $10,000 or else Krisida would be killed. The letter indicated that payment was due by September 5. Instead of paying the ransom, Treska's mother arranged Krisida's departure to the United States. Treska stated that the kidnappers threatened his mother when they found out that Krisida had left the country, but he also reported that no actual harm had come to her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Krisida testified that she was eleven years old at the time of her kidnapping. She reported that she was playing outside her uncle's house just before she was kidnapped. Two masked men jumped out of a car and grabbed her, and then took her by car to the basement of an old house. When it was dark outside, the men came back and drove Krisida to her grandmother's house. Krisida testified that the men \"left [her] at the end of the street\" and that she walked to the house by herself. She made clear that upon her return, her grandmother did not speak with her abductors or give them anything.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the hearing, the IJ issued an oral decision denying Treska's and Dine's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. The IJ found neither Treska nor Krisida to be credible, citing their demeanor in court and inconsistencies in Treska's testimony relative to Krisida's testimony and documentary evidence. Furthermore, the IJ found no nexus between the alleged kidnapping and one of the five statutorily protected grounds, commenting that there was no evidence as to the motives of the kidnappers. With respect to the asylum and withholding claims, the IJ concluded that Treska and Dine had failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. With respect to the CAT claims, the IJ found that Treska and Dine had failed to show that torture would be \"inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\" Treska and Dine appealed to the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 22, 2005, the BIA dismissed the petitioners' appeal.

However, the IJ found Treska's and Krisida's testimony to be incredible, and he supported this determination with a number of subsidiary findings. For example, the IJ found it highly suspect that the petitioners decided at their hearing to focus entirely on Krisida's kidnapping, even though their motion to reopen proceedings&#8212;which was filed on October 5, 2001, <i>after</i> the alleged abduction&#8212;made no mention of the $2,000 payment to the Democratic Party of Albania, the public announcement of the donation, the threatened kidnapping, the actual kidnapping, the ransom payment, or the demand for additional payment. When asked during the proceeding why these events were not recounted in the motion to reopen, Treska explained that he and his wife filed the motion through a different attorney and that they had in fact explained these events to him. Treska was unclear, however, about whether the previous attorney had gone over the contents of the motion to reopen with him and his wife, first appearing to say \"yes\" and then later saying \"no.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ also found it highly suspect that the events in question all happened shortly after the BIA's denial of the petitioners' appeal on May 15, 2001. Indeed, Treska testified that Dine had sent the $2,000 to her mother in May or June 2001. By early September 2001, the petitioners' daughter had arrived in the United States, and in October 2001, they filed their petition to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the IJ noted inconsistencies between Treska's testimony and the documentary evidence before the court. In particular, the IJ was concerned by Treska's testimony that the second threat against his daughter occurred on August 27, 2001; a police record with an authenticated signature indicates that Treska's mother reported the second threat on July 27, 2001. When confronted with this discrepancy, Treska suggested that the police report could have contained a typographical error, an explanation that the IJ found unconvincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ additionally took issue with Treska's evasiveness when asked how he received one of the ransom notes, as well as with his non-responsiveness when the government asked exactly how he transported $15,000 in cash to Albania. The IJ noted that Treska's parents continue to live unharmed in Albania, despite the threats his mother reportedly received after Krisida's departure for the United States. Furthermore, the IJ highlighted the discrepancies between Treska's testimony and Krisida's testimony regarding the circumstances of Krisida's return to Treska's mother's house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ provided \"specific, cogent reason[s] for [his] disbelief,\" <i>Gailius v. INS,</i> 147 F.3d 34, 47 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting <i>Turcios v. INS,</i> 821 F.2d 1396, 1399 (9th Cir.1987)) (internal quotation marks omitted), and we cannot say that either the IJ or the BIA erred in finding the testimony of Treska and Krisida incredible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The adverse credibility determinations defeat the petitioners' asylum claims. We have noted that \"[w]hen a petitioner's case depends on the veracity of ... testimony, a fully supported adverse credibility determination, without more, can sustain a denial of asylum.\" <i>Olujoke v. Gonzales,</i> 411 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir.2005). This is such a case. The petitioners' claims depend on the veracity of the testimony given by Treska and his daughter, Krisida. In light of the adverse credibility determinations, we hold that there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion that Treska and Dine failed to show either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our affirmance of the denial of petitioners' asylum claims effectively disposes of their withholding of removal claims. <i>See Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> 387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st Cir.2004) (\"A claim for withholding of deportation demands that the alien carry a more stringent burden of proof than does an asylum claim. Thus, if an alien cannot establish asylum eligibility, his claim for withholding of deportation fails a fortiori.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the petitioners' brief does not advance any arguments regarding the CAT, we deem that these claims have been waived. <i>See Mediouni v.

The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") specifically noted that he found Treska and his daughter, Krisida Treska (\"Krisida\"), not to be credible witnesses. The BIA upheld the IJ's adverse credibility determinations; it also affirmed the IJ's conclusion that Treska and Dine failed to establish a nexus between the events in question and a statutorily protected ground under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42).

In an interview with an immigration inspector, Treska stated that he was not making any claim to United States citizenship and that he was visiting for the purpose of attending his brother's wedding. Treska and Dine were denied entry and placed into exclusion proceedings. On November 18, 1994, they admitted excludability, and on December 30, 1994, they filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal, claiming past persecution on the basis of religion, nationality, and political opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the exclusion proceedings on June 30, 1995, Treska testified to his being Christian Orthodox, ethnic Romanian, and a member of the Democratic Party in Albania. He reported that his father's bakery had been taken over by the government in 1967, that Muslims made up the majority of the government and received preferential treatment, and that Christians had been kept from rebuilding the church in his hometown. Dine did not testify at the exclusion proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 14, 1996, the IJ issued an oral decision denying the petitioners' application for asylum and withholding of removal. The IJ concluded that the applicants \"ha[d] not met their burden of establishing that if they were to return to Albania that they w[ould] be persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution\" on account of one of the five statutorily protected grounds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Treska and Dine appealed this decision, and the BIA dismissed the appeal on May 15, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the petitioners' daughter, Krisida, arrived in the United States on September 8, 2001, having presented herself for admission under the Visa Waiver Pilot Program under a different name.

When confronted with this discrepancy, Treska suggested that the police report could have contained a typographical error, an explanation that the IJ found unconvincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ additionally took issue with Treska's evasiveness when asked how he received one of the ransom notes, as well as with his non-responsiveness when the government asked exactly how he transported $15,000 in cash to Albania. The IJ noted that Treska's parents continue to live unharmed in Albania, despite the threats his mother reportedly received after Krisida's departure for the United States. Furthermore, the IJ highlighted the discrepancies between Treska's testimony and Krisida's testimony regarding the circumstances of Krisida's return to Treska's mother's house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ provided \"specific, cogent reason[s] for [his] disbelief,\" <i>Gailius v.

We have noted that \"[w]hen a petitioner's case depends on the veracity of ... testimony, a fully supported adverse credibility determination, without more, can sustain a denial of asylum.\" <i>Olujoke v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2005). This is such a case. The petitioners' claims depend on the veracity of the testimony given by Treska and his daughter, Krisida. In light of the adverse credibility determinations, we hold that there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion that Treska and Dine failed to show either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our affirmance of the denial of petitioners' asylum claims effectively disposes of their withholding of removal claims. <i>See Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201313\"><a href=\"/opinion/201313/makhoul-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 82 (1st Cir.2004) (\"A claim for withholding of deportation demands that the alien carry a more stringent burden of proof than does an asylum claim. Thus, if an alien cannot establish asylum eligibility, his claim for withholding of deportation fails a fortiori.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the petitioners' brief does not advance any arguments regarding the CAT, we deem that these claims have been waived. <i>See Mediouni v.
