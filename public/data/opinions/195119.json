Defendant-appellant  Daniel  Atilio\n           \n\nAdinolfi  pleaded guilty  on September  10,  1992 to  several\n\ncounts  of  an  indictment charging  him  with  conspiracy to\n\npossess with intent to distribute narcotics, distribution  of\n\nnarcotics,   and  possession   with   intent  to   distribute\n\nnarcotics.   From  October 22  to 29,  1992, one  of Atilio's\n\nalleged co-conspirators, Jairo Giraldo Parra, was tried under\n\nthe same indictment.  On December 16, 1992, following receipt\n\nof the presentence  investigation report (\"the PSI  report\"),\n\nthe  district court sentenced  Atilio to concurrent  terms of\n\nninety-two months'  imprisonment on each  count, a supervised\n\nrelease term of five years, and a special monetary assessment\n\nof $ 350.   In arriving at this sentence under the sentencing\n\nguidelines,  the  district  court  made  a  two-level  upward\n\nadjustment in Atilio's  offense level pursuant to  U.S.S.G.  \n\n3B1.1(c)  on  the  ground  that  Atilio  was a  \"manager\"  or\n\n\"supervisor\"  in   the  narcotics   distribution  conspiracy.\n\nAtilio appeals from this upward adjustment.  We affirm. \n\nIn  explaining  its   ruling  that  Atilio   was  a\n\n\"manager\" or  \"supervisor\" in this criminal organization, the\n\ndistrict court stated,\n\nThe Court  has heard argument  of counsel\nand  has heard  the defendant and  is now\nready to  rule on  the issue  of the  two\npoints  on  the  issue of  supervisor  --\nsupervisory  role.  The  -- this Court is\nin  a  position  to rule  on  this  issue\nparticularly because I  presided over the\ntrial   of  Jairo   Giraldo  Parra,   and\n\n                   -3-\n\ncertainly   the   facts  in   that   case\nestablish that -- those facts establish -\n-   establishes   that    the   defendant\nAdinolfi, Atilio Adinolfi, certainly held\na position of trust and confidence with -\n- within Giraldo Parra's drug trafficking\norganization  and he  certainly played  a\nsupervisory role, a very important role.\n\nHe   was   present   at   most   of   the\ntransactions.   He also drove with one of\nthe  agents   who  was  acting   as  a[n]\nundercover agent.   He  also participated\nin the transactions, and certainly he was\nthere  in charge  of  the business,  too,\nsometimes  in the  counter, and he  was a\nvery  important  cog in  the  trafficking\nmachinery  constantly  oiled   by  Parra.\nTherefore, I shall  deny you[r] counsel's\nmotion   to   eliminate   the  two-points\nenhancement under Section 3B1.1B [sic] of\nthe sentencing guidelines.\n\nAtilio objects on appeal, as he did in the district\n\ncourt, that it  was impermissible for  the district court  to\n\nrely on  evidence introduced  at the trial  of Jairo  Giraldo\n\nParra.  Since Atilio, having  pleaded guilty, was not a party\n\nto that  trial, Atilio argues  that he had no  opportunity to\n\ncross-examine  the witnesses  who provided  the evidence  the\n\ndistrict court used against him.  Once that trial evidence is\n\nexcluded, Atilio  contends, there  was insufficient  evidence\n\nbefore the district court to justify the upward adjustment.\n\nWe  have stated  that \"[i]t  is  well settled  that\n\nduring the sentencing proceedings, a district court has broad\n\ndiscretion  in   determining  the  information  that  may  be\n\nreceived  and  considered  regarding a  defendant.\"    United\n                                                   \n\nStates v. Pellerito, 918 F.2d 999, 1002 (1st Cir. 1990).   As\n         \n\n                   -4-\n\nlong  as the district court complies with the requirements of\n\nFed. R. Crim.  P. 32 by making  a finding as to  each factual\n\nmatter controverted by the defendant, the district court \"has\n\na right to use the evidence presented at trial in determining\n\nthe  sentence to  be imposed.\"    Id.   Accordingly, we  have\n                          \n\nupheld the sentencing judge's reliance on trial evidence when\n\nthe trial  had resulted in  a mistrial and the  defendant had\n\nsubsequently pleaded guilty, United States v. Hanono-Surujun,\n                                                  \n\n914 F.2d 15,  19 (1st Cir.  1990), and --  as in the  instant\n\ncase --  when the  defendant had pleaded  guilty and  did not\n\nstand trial, and the trial evidence stemmed from the trial of\n\nco-defendants.  United States v. Fuentes-Moreno, 895 F.2d 24,\n                                     \n\n26 (1st  Cir. 1990).   Our  review of  the record shows  that\n\nAtilio did not controvert any specific facts from that trial.\n\nAccordingly,  the  district  court was  entitled  to  rely on\n\nevidence from  the  trial of  Giraldo Parra  in reaching  its\n\ndetermination under   3B1.1.\n\nIn  any event,  even  if  the  district  court  had\n\ndisregarded  the evidence from the trial of Giraldo Parra, we\n\nfind that there  remained sufficient evidence to  sustain the\n\nchallenged ruling.   Since the question whether  Atilio was a\n\nmanager or  supervisor \"is a  question of the  application of\n\nthe Guidelines to the particular facts\" of this  case, United\n                                                   \n\nStates  v. Wright,  873 F.2d  437,  443 (1st  Cir. 1989),  we\n       \n\nreview the  district court's determination  that the evidence\n\n                   -5-\n\nwas  sufficient  only for  clear  error.    United States  v.\n                                               \n\nCorcimiglia,  967  F.2d  724, 726  (1st  Cir.  1992); Wright,\n                                                  \n\nsupra, 873 F.2d at 444.\n\n\nTo  meet its  burden  of  proving  that  an  upward\n\nadjustment is warranted, the government must demonstrate that\n\nthe defendant exercised  \"some degree of control  over others\n\ninvolved in  the commission  of the offense  or he  must have\n\nbeen responsible  for organizing  others for  the purpose  of\n\ncarrying out the  crime.\"  United  States v. Castellone,  985\n                                             \n\nF.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v. Fuller,\n                                                  \n\n897 F.2d 1217,  1220 (1st Cir. 1990)).  At the change of plea\n\nhearing, the  prosecution offered  the  following account  of\n\nAtilio's  actions  as  part  of  the  narcotics  distribution\n\nconspiracy.\n\nAtilio . .  . and others operated  from a\nbusiness   establishment   known   as  Mi\nPequena  Colombia  Restaurant .  .   . in\nHato  Rey, Puerto  Rico to  carry  out an\noperation of distribution  of cocaine and\nheroin. . . . \n\nOn  September  25, 1991,  the  undercover\nagent  met  again with  Victor  Rodriquez\nAlvarez at  the Magno's  Pizza Restaurant\nat  which  time  another  transaction  of\nheroin took place for $7,000.  At that --\nafter that transaction took place, Victor\nRodriguez Alvarez carried the brown paper\nbag  containing  the  $7,000  to  the  Mi\nPequena Colombia Restaurant  where Victor\nRodriguez,  where  Daniel  Alberto Atilio\nAdinolfi, Jairo  Giraldo Parra  and Edgar\nRodriguez Alvarez were waiting.\n\nVictor Rodriguez  Alvarez gave  the brown\npaper    bag    to     codefendant    and\n\n                   -6-\n\ncoconspirator   Daniel   Alberto   Atilio\nAdinolfi at which  time they entered  the\nrear room of the restaurant.\n\nOn December 6, 1991, an informant  of the\nDrug   Enforcement  Administration   made\narrangements with  Daniel Alberto  Atilio\nAdinolfi  to  buy  half   a  kilogram  of\ncocaine  for  $5,000.   The  confidential\ninformant  proceeded  to the  Mi  Pequena\nColombia  Restaurant  where he  met  with\nDaniel Alberto  Atilio Adinolfi  at which\ntime  they entered  a  vehicle, and  they\ndrove  around  the  block  at which  time\nagents  conducting  surveillance  noticed\nJorge  Omar   Lopez  Almeida   performing\ncounter-surveillance      during      the\ntransaction.\n\nOnce the transaction was completed inside\nthe vehicle,  they  returned  to  the  Mi\nPequena  Colombia  Restaurant  where both\nthe  confidential  informant  and  Atilio\nAdinolfi exited the car.  The cooperating\nindividual entered an  undercover vehicle\nbeing  driven  at  that  time by  Special\nAgent Hector  Ortiz at which  time agents\nconducting   surveillance  noticed   when\nAtilio Adinolfi signaled Jorge Omar Lopez\nAlmeida who was directly across from  the\nMi Pequena Colombia  Restaurant, and they\nalso saw -- observed when Atilio Adinolfi\nboarded  the  vehicle  and  proceeded  to\nfollow the undercover car being driven by\nSpecial Agent Hector Ortiz.\n\nAn   undercover  agent   from  the   Drug\nEnforcement   Administration   who    was\nconducting   surveillance    inside   the\nrestaurant listened when  codefendant and\ncoconspirator  Edgar  Rodriguez Velazquez\ntold Daniel Alberto  Atilio Adinolfi that\nthe undercover  vehicle was  heading west\non Domenech Avenue.\n\nSubsequently, on  December 11,  1991, the\ncooperating  individual  informed  Daniel\nAlberto  Atilio  Adinolfi that  the  half\nkilogram  of  cocaine was  short  several\ngrams.\n\n                   -7-\n\nOn December  12th, 1991,  the cooperating\nindividual   went  to   the  Mi   Pequena\nColombia Restaurant where  Daniel Alberto\nAtilio  Adinolfi  provided him  with  six\ngrams   of  cocaine   missing  from   the\noriginal half kilogram of cocaine, and he\nalso  provided  him   with  a  sample  of\nheroin.   Both the  missing six  grams of\ncocaine  and the  sample  of heroin  were\ngiven to  Daniel Alberto  Atilio Adinolfi\nby  codefendant  and  coconspirator Jairo\nGiraldo Parra.\n\nAtilio  agreed at the  change of plea  hearing that\n\nthis statement of facts was  accurate, at least insofar as it\n\nrelated  to Atilio's  own conduct.   The  PSI report  set out\n\nessentially the same  version of the  facts, to which  Atilio\n\nmade no objection at the sentencing hearing.\n\nAlthough it is true  that this account by no  means\n\nestablishes  unambiguously  that  Atilio  was  a  manager  or\n\nsupervisor, we  cannot say  that such a  finding was  clearly\n\nerroneous.  Atilio's conduct in  negotiating the details of a\n\nsale  of  cocaine  and  agreeing  to  supply  a  shortfall in\n\ndelivery would reasonably suggest a managerial or supervisory\n\nrole if coupled with some evidence that Atilio to some degree\n\n\ndirected   or   controlled  at   least  one   other  criminal\n\nparticipant.   See United  States v. Veilleux,  949 F.2d 522,\n                                   \n\n525  (1st   Cir.  1991)   (\"Setting  the   details  of   drug\n\ntransactions in such  a manner as  to orchestrate the  sales,\n\nwhere the offender  also directs at least one  accomplice, is\n\nsufficient  to uphold  a     3B1.1(c) sentencing  enhancement\n\nagainst a  challenge of clear error\").   See also Castellone,\n                                                  \n\n                   -8-\n\nsupra,  985  F.2d   at  26  (the  fact  that   the  defendant\n\n\n\"determined who purchased,  when and where sales  took place,\n\nprices,  and profit .  . .  can be  said of  any independent,\n\nstreet-level dealer\"  and is insufficient  where \"[t]here  is\n\nsimply no evidence that [the defendant] exercised any control\n\nover . . . anyone else\").\n\nThe necessary  evidence that Atilio to  some degree\n\ndirected  or  controlled  at least  one  other  accomplice is\n\npresent here.  When  Victor Rodriguez Alvarez entered  the Mi\n\nPequena  Colombia restaurant on September 25, 1991, he handed\n\nover a brown paper bag -- containing $ 7,000 of proceeds from\n\nthe  sale of heroin  -- to Atilio.   The fact  that Rodriguez\n\nAlvarez  rendered the  proceeds of  the  drug transaction  to\n\nAtilio  reasonably suggests  that Atilio  exercised at  least\n\nsome degree of direction or control over Rodriguez Alvarez as\n\npart of  the  criminal organization.   Certainly  it was  not\n\nclear error for the  sentencing judge to interpret the  facts\n\nin that light.\n\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                              \n\n                   -9-\n",

From October 22 to 29, 1992, one of Atilio's alleged co-conspirators, Jairo Giraldo Parra, was tried under the same indictment.  On December 16, 1992, following receipt of the presentence investigation report (\"the PSI report\"), the district court sentenced Atilio to concurrent terms of ninety-two months' imprisonment on each count, a supervised release term of five years, and a special monetary assessment of $ 350.  In arriving at this sentence under the sentencing guidelines, the district court made a two-level upward adjustment in Atilio's offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(c) on the ground that Atilio was a \"manager\" or \"supervisor\" in the narcotics distribution conspiracy.  Atilio appeals from this upward adjustment.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In explaining its ruling that Atilio was a \"manager\" or \"supervisor\" in this criminal organization, the district court stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>The Court has heard argument of counsel and has heard the defendant and is now ready to rule on the issue of the two points on the issue of supervisor-supervisory role.  The-this Court is in a position to rule on this issue particularly because I presided over the trial of Jairo Giraldo Parra, and certainly the facts in that case establish that-those facts establish-establishes that the defendant Adinolfi, Atilio Adinolfi, certainly held a position of trust and confidence with-within Giraldo Parra's drug trafficking organization and he certainly played a supervisory role, a very important role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He was present at most of the transactions.  He also drove with one of the agents who was acting as a[n] undercover agent.  He also participated in the transactions, and certainly he was there in charge of the business, too, sometimes in the counter, and he was a very important cog in the trafficking machinery constantly oiled by Parra.  Therefore, I shall deny you[r] counsel's motion to eliminate the two-points enhancement under Section 3B1.1B [sic] of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Atilio objects on appeal, as he did in the district court, that it was impermissible for the district court to rely on evidence introduced at the trial of Jairo Giraldo Parra.

The confidential informant proceeded to the Mi Pequena Colombia Restaurant where he met with Daniel Alberto Atilio Adinolfi at which time they entered a vehicle, and they drove around the block at which time agents conducting surveillance noticed Jorge Omar Lopez Almeida performing counter-surveillance during the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the transaction was completed inside the vehicle, they returned to the Mi Pequena Colombia Restaurant where both the confidential informant and Atilio Adinolfi exited the car.  The cooperating individual entered an undercover vehicle being driven at that time by Special Agent Hector Ortiz at which time agents conducting surveillance noticed when Atilio Adinolfi signaled Jorge Omar Lopez Almeida who was directly across from the Mi Pequena Colombia Restaurant, and they also saw-observed when Atilio Adinolfi boarded the vehicle and proceeded to follow the undercover car being driven by Special Agent Hector Ortiz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An undercover agent from the Drug Enforcement Administration who was conducting surveillance inside the restaurant listened when codefendant and coconspirator Edgar Rodriguez Velazquez told Daniel Alberto Atilio Adinolfi that the undercover vehicle was heading west on Domenech Avenue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, on December 11, 1991, the cooperating individual informed Daniel Alberto Atilio Adinolfi that the half kilogram of cocaine was short several grams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 12th, 1991, the cooperating individual went to the Mi Pequena Colombia Restaurant where Daniel Alberto Atilio Adinolfi provided him with six grams of cocaine missing from the original half kilogram of cocaine, and he also provided him with a sample of heroin.  Both the missing six grams of cocaine and the sample of heroin were given to Daniel Alberto Atilio Adinolfi by codefendant and coconspirator Jairo Giraldo Parra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Atilio agreed at the change of plea hearing that this statement of facts was accurate, at least insofar as it related to Atilio's own conduct.

Atilio's conduct in negotiating the details of a sale of cocaine and agreeing to supply a shortfall in delivery would reasonably suggest a managerial or supervisory role if coupled with some evidence that Atilio to some degree directed or controlled at least one other criminal participant.   See United States v. Veilleux, 949 F.2d 522, 525 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"Setting the details of drug transactions in such a manner as to orchestrate the sales, where the offender also directs at least one accomplice, is sufficient to uphold a Sec. 3B1.1(c) sentencing enhancement against a challenge of clear error\").  See also Castellone, supra, 985 F.2d at 26 (the fact that the defendant \"determined who purchased, when and where sales took place, prices, and profit ... can be said of any independent, street-level dealer\" and is insufficient where \"[t]here is simply no evidence that [the defendant] exercised any control over ... anyone else\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The necessary evidence that Atilio to some degree directed or controlled at least one other accomplice is present here.  When Victor Rodriguez Alvarez entered the Mi Pequena Colombia restaurant on September 25, 1991, he handed over a brown paper bag-containing $ 7,000 of proceeds from the sale of heroin-to Atilio.  The fact that Rodriguez Alvarez rendered the proceeds of the drug transaction to Atilio reasonably suggests that Atilio exercised at least some degree of direction or control over Rodriguez Alvarez as part of the criminal organization.  Certainly it was not clear error for the sentencing judge to interpret the facts in that light.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

From October 22 to 29, 1992, one of Atilio's alleged co-conspirators, Jairo Giraldo Parra, was tried under the same indictment.  On December 16, 1992, following receipt of the presentence investigation report (\"the PSI report\"), the district court sentenced Atilio to concurrent terms of ninety-two months' imprisonment on each count, a supervised release term of five years, and a special monetary assessment of $ 350.  In arriving at this sentence under the sentencing guidelines, the district court made a two-level upward adjustment in Atilio's offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(c) on the ground that Atilio was a \"manager\" or \"supervisor\" in the narcotics distribution conspiracy.  Atilio appeals from this upward adjustment.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In explaining its ruling that Atilio was a \"manager\" or \"supervisor\" in this criminal organization, the district court stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>The Court has heard argument of counsel and has heard the defendant and is now ready to rule on the issue of the two points on the issue of supervisor-supervisory role.  The-this Court is in a position to rule on this issue particularly because I presided over the trial of Jairo Giraldo Parra, and certainly the facts in that case establish that-those facts establish-establishes that the defendant Adinolfi, Atilio Adinolfi, certainly held a position of trust and confidence with-within Giraldo Parra's drug trafficking organization and he certainly played a supervisory role, a very important role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He was present at most of the transactions.  He also drove with one of the agents who was acting as a[n] undercover agent.  He also participated in the transactions, and certainly he was there in charge of the business, too, sometimes in the counter, and he was a very important cog in the trafficking machinery constantly oiled by Parra.  Therefore, I shall deny you[r] counsel's motion to eliminate the two-points enhancement under Section 3B1.1B [sic] of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Atilio objects on appeal, as he did in the district court, that it was impermissible for the district court to rely on evidence introduced at the trial of Jairo Giraldo Parra.  Since Atilio, having pleaded guilty, was not a party to that trial, Atilio argues that he had no opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses who provided the evidence the district court used against him.  Once that trial evidence is excluded, Atilio contends, there was insufficient evidence before the district court to justify the upward adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have stated that \"[i]t is well settled that during the sentencing proceedings, a district court has broad discretion in determining the information that may be received and considered regarding a defendant.\"   United States v. Pellerito, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551472\"><a href=\"/opinion/551472/united-states-v-giuseppe-pellerito/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></a></span>, 1002 (1st Cir. 1990).  As long as the district court complies with the requirements of Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32 by making a finding as to each factual matter controverted by the defendant, the district court \"has a right to use the evidence presented at trial in determining the sentence to be imposed.\"  Id. Accordingly, we have upheld the sentencing judge's reliance on trial evidence when the trial had resulted in a mistrial and the defendant had subsequently pleaded guilty,  United States v. Hanono-Surujun, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547667\"><a href=\"/opinion/547667/united-states-v-jose-hanono-surujun/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir. 1990), and-as in the instant case-when the defendant had pleaded guilty and did not stand trial, and the trial evidence stemmed from the trial of co-defendants.   United States v. Fuentes-Moreno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536028\"><a href=\"/opinion/536028/united-states-v-yessid-fuentes-moreno/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir. 1990).  Our review of the record shows that Atilio did not controvert any specific facts from that trial.  Accordingly, the district court was entitled to rely on evidence from the trial of Giraldo Parra in reaching its determination under Sec. 3B1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, even if the district court had disregarded the evidence from the trial of Giraldo Parra, we find that there remained sufficient evidence to sustain the challenged ruling.  Since the question whether Atilio was a manager or supervisor \"is a question of the application of the Guidelines to the particular facts\" of this case,  United States v. Wright, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522147\"><a href=\"/opinion/522147/united-states-v-bertie-alexander-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span>, 443 (1st Cir. 1989), we review the district court's determination that the evidence was sufficient only for clear error.   United States v. Corcimiglia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585785\"><a href=\"/opinion/585785/united-states-v-deborah-d-corcimiglia/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span>, 726 (1st Cir. 1992);   Wright, supra, 873 F.2d at 444.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To meet its burden of proving that an upward adjustment is warranted, the government must demonstrate that the defendant exercised \"some degree of control over others involved in the commission of the offense or he must have been responsible for organizing others for the purpose of carrying out the crime.\"   United States v. Castellone, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599288\"><a href=\"/opinion/599288/united-states-v-paul-j-castellone/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting  United States v.
