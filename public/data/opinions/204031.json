Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n                    Torruella, Ripple,* and Boudin,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     James V. Tabner for appellants.\n     Todd B. Gordon with whom Stephen F. Gordon and The Gordon Law\nFirm LLP were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                            October 8, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           Per Curiam.     This appeal arises from the bankruptcy of\n\nDavid Deaver Brown and Simply Media, Inc., and efforts by Bradley\n\nReifler (a creditor of Simply Media) and Steven Notinger (the\n\nbankruptcy     trustee   for   David   Brown   and   Simply   Media)   to   (1)\n\nestablish that two parcels of land in New Hampshire (denominated\n\nparcels 67 and 68) were David Brown's property, and so part of the\n\nbankruptcy estate, and (2) recover fraudulent transfers allegedly\n\nmade by Simply Media in paying expenses that related to the New\n\nHampshire parcels.\n\n           Because of deficient briefing, this court dismissed a\n\nprior appeal by Christina Brown that involved the same appellees\n\nand arose from the same two bankruptcies, In re: Simply Media,\n\nInc., 566 F.3d 234, 235 (1st Cir. 2009) (per curiam).              The prior\n\ncase involved claims that Simply Media fraudulently transferred\n\nassets located in Massachusetts and was tried to a jury verdict;\n\nthe jury returned a multi-million dollar verdict against Christina\n\nBrown.   Id.\n\n           The current dispute was heard by the bankruptcy court in\n\nlate 2007; its May 2008 final judgment favored the Browns on some\n\nclaims and Reifler and Notinger on others. Only the Browns appeal,\n\nso we focus on the claims decided against them.                  First, the\n\nbankruptcy court ruled that parcel 68 was being held by Christina\n\nBrown in constructive trust for David Brown, making it part of his\n\nbankruptcy estate (the court found that the other parcel, parcel\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f67, was not part of the estate).           Second, the bankruptcy court\n\nfound that Simply Media paid $56,585 in expenses related to the New\n\nHampshire parcels--including property taxes, utilities, and repair\n\ncosts--and that these payments constituted a fraudulent transfer by\n\nthe company to or for the benefit of David Brown and Christina\n\nBrown.    In making this fraudulent transfer finding, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt relied partly on adverse inferences drawn from the Browns'\n\nspoliation and non-production of relevant evidence.\n\n            The bankruptcy court's final judgment required Christina\n\nBrown to turn over parcel 68 to the bankruptcy trustee by executing\n\na quitclaim deed and held David Brown and Christina Brown obligated\n\nto pay $56,585 to the bankruptcy trustee. The Browns appealed, and\n\nthe district court affirmed these rulings (save that it required a\n\nreadjustment in pre-judgment interest).             This appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's affirmance followed.\n\n            We do not reach any of the issues on the merits.              The\n\nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure require that an appellant's\n\nbrief    provide   \"a   statement   of   facts   relevant   to   the   issues\n\nsubmitted for review with appropriate references to the record\" and\n\nan argument \"with citations to the authorities and parts of the\n\nrecord on which the appellant relies.\"           Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(7),\n\n(9)(A). The Browns' briefing does not meet either requirement, and\n\nit does not adequately present any issue for our review.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f           Despite its length, the Browns' opening brief leaves\n\nunclear what claims are being advanced and what facts bear on what\n\nclaims. Although many of its arguments turn on legal propositions,\n\nit cites only three cases not connected to this appeal, and does\n\nnot seriously engage with any of the precedents that might bear on\n\nany issue in this appeal. Despite numerous factual assertions, the\n\nbrief rarely provides citations to the record.              The occasional\n\nquotations from portions of the trial transcript do not provide\n\nsupport for the bulk of the brief's factual assertions.\n\n           The      deficiencies    in     the   appellants'     brief   are\n\nunsurprising because much has been taken verbatim from Christina\n\nBrown's brief in the prior appeal.           This borrowing might not be\n\nsurprising because the two appeals involve some similar facts and\n\nissues;   as   we    previously    found   the   prior   brief   inadequate,\n\nborrowing merely perpetuates that inadequacy. Strikingly, the most\n\nprominent arguments in the present appeal are ones that this court\n\nalready found to be inadequate on the prior appeal:\n\n           --that the New Hampshire Business Corporation\n           Act, N.H. Rev. Stat. § 293-A:1.01 et seq.\n           (2009), authorized Simply Media to pay\n           expenses for an office and so the expenses it\n           paid cannot be a fraudulent transfer;\n\n           --that Simply Media was not a business sham,\n           as allegedly illustrated by the fact that\n           Notinger separately sued three of Simply\n           Media's former board members; and\n\n           --that spoliation sanctions were unwarranted\n           because no evidence of spoilation was produced\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f          and because the same documents            could   be\n          obtained from third-parties.\n\nWe addressed these issues in the prior appeal, In re: Simply Media,\n\nInc., 566 F.3d at 236, and explained why the briefing did not\n\ndevelop law or facts in support of the claims and why they were\n\nfacially unpersuasive.\n\n          Given   the   deficiencies   of   the   present   briefing,   we\n\ndismiss this appeal,    Reyes-Garcia v. Rodriguez & Del Valle, Inc.,\n\n82 F.3d 11, 15-16 (1st Cir. 1996), and order Brown's counsel of\n\nrecord to show cause by written response within 14 days as to why\n\nthe court should not order payment by him personally of attorney's\n\nfees, double costs or both for a brief that renders the appeal\n\nfrivolous.   See Fed. R. App. P. 38; 1st Cir. R. 38.0.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
