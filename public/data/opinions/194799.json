Each of these  two appeals\n                              \n\nconcerns  the district  court's power  to impose  a sentence\n\nthat departs from the Sentencing Guidelines.  The first case\n\ninvolves  Mirna  Rivera,  a  single mother  of  three  small\n\nchildren.   Ms.  Rivera was  convicted of  carrying about  a\n\npound of cocaine from  New York to Providence.   She appeals\n\nher thirty-three month sentence of imprisonment.  She argues\n\nthat the  district court  would have departed  downward from\n\nthe minimum  thirty-three month  Guidelines prison term  but\n\nfor the court's view that it lacked the legal \"authority\" to\n\ndepart.   She says that this view is legally \"incorrect,\" 18\n\nU.S.C.    3742(f)(1),  and she  asks  us  to set  aside  her\n\nsentence.\n\n          The second case involves a union official,  Robert\n\nAdamo, who embezzled about  $100,000 from his union's Health\n\nand Welfare Fund.  The district court departed downward from\n\nthe  fifteen  to  twenty-one  month  prison  term  that  the\n\nGuidelines  themselves would  have required.   Instead,  the\n\ncourt imposed a term of probation  without confinement.  The\n\ncourt  said that it was departing downward so that Mr. Adamo\n\ncould  continue to work and to make restitution to the Fund.\n\nThe  Government   appeals.      It   argues   that   Adamo's\n\ncircumstancesare insufficientlyunusualtowarrantthedeparture.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n          We agree with  the appellants in  both cases.   In\n\nour view, the  district court sentencing Ms. Rivera  held an\n\nunduly narrow  view of its  departure powers.   The district\n\ncourt sentencing Mr.  Adamo failed to  analyze the need  for\n\ndeparture in the  way that  the law requires.   We  consider\n\nboth  cases in this single opinion because doing so may help\n\nto    illustrate   an   appropriate   legal   analysis   for\n\n\"departures.\"   We  shall first  set forth  our view  of the\n\nportion  of the law here applicable; and we shall then apply\n\nthat law to the two appeals.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Departures\n                                   \n\n          The basic theory of the Sentencing Guidelines is a\n\nsimple  one.   In  order  to  lessen  the  degree  to  which\n\ndifferent judges  imposed different sentences  in comparable\n\ncases,   an   expert  Sentencing   Commission   would  write\n\nGuidelines,   applicable   to   most   ordinary   sentencing\n\nsituations.  See S. Rep.  No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess.  38,\n                \n\n51, 161  (1984), reprinted in 1984  U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3221,\n                             \n\n3234, 3344.  In an ordinary situation, the statutes, and the\n\nGuidelines themselves, would require  the judge to apply the\n\nappropriate guideline  -- a  guideline  that would  normally\n\ncabin,  within fairly  narrow limits,  the judge's  power to\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nchoose  the  length  of   a  prison  term.    18   U.S.C.   \n\n3553(a),(b).  Should the judge face a situation that was not\n\nordinary,  the  judge  could   depart  from  the  Guidelines\n\nsentence,  provided  that  the  judge then  sets  forth  the\n\nreasons for departure.   18 U.S.C.   3553(b),(c).    A court\n\nof appeals would review the departure  for \"reasonableness.\"\n\n18  U.S.C.   3742.  And, the Commission itself would collect\n\nand study both the district courts' departure determinations\n\nand the courts of appeals' decisions, thereby learning about\n\nthe Guidelines' actual workings  and using that knowledge to\n\nhelp revise or clarify  the Guidelines for the future.   See\n                                                            \n\nS. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong.,  2d Sess. 80, 151, reprinted in\n                                                            \n\n1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 3263,  3334;  U.S.S.G. Ch.  1, Pt.  A,\n\nintro. comment 4(b).\n\n          This  basic   theory  is  embodied   in  statutory\n\nprovisions and in  the Guidelines themselves.  We believe it\n\nimportant to refer to this theory in explaining our own view\n\nof the  legal provisions  concerning departures, and  of how\n\nboth  district  courts and  courts of  appeals are  to apply\n\nthem.\n\n                             A\n\n                        The Statute\n                                   \n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\n          The Sentencing Statute itself sets forth the basic\n\nlaw  governing departures.   It  tells the  sentencing court\n\nthat it\n\n          shall impose a sentence of the kind, and\n                      \n          within the range  . . .  established for\n          the   applicable  category   of  offense\n          committed by the applicable  category of\n          defendant as set forth in the guidelines\n          . . . . \n\n18 U.S.C.    3553(b) (incorporating 18  U.S.C.   3553(a)(4))\n\n(emphasis added).  The statute goes on immediately to create\n\nan exception  for departures  by adding that  the sentencing\n\ncourt shall \"impose\" this Guidelines sentence\n\n          unless the court finds that there exists\n                \n          an     aggravating     or     mitigating\n          circumstance of  a kind, or to a degree,\n          not adequately  taken into consideration\n          by   the    Sentencing   Commission   in\n          formulating  the guidelines  that should\n          result in a sentence different from that\n          described.\n\n18  U.S.C.   3553(b) (emphasis  added).    If the sentencing\n\ncourt  makes   this  finding  and  sentences   \"outside  the\n\n[Guidelines] range,\" it must \n\n          state in  open court . .  . the specific\n          reason for the  imposition of a sentence\n          different  from  that described  [in the\n          guidelines]. \n\n18  U.S.C.    3553(c).   The  defendant  may then  appeal an\n\nupward departure,  and the Government may  appeal a downward\n\ndeparture.    18  U.S.C.    3742(a),(b);  United  States  v.\n                                                        \n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nPighetti,  898  F.2d 3,  4 (1st  Cir. 1990)  (beneficiary of\n        \n\ndeparture  decision  lacks  standing \"to  complain  that the\n\ndeviation should have been greater\").  On appeal, if \n\n          the court of appeals determines that the\n          sentence . . . is unreasonable, . . . it\n                                        \n          shall  state  specific  reasons for  its\n          conclusions  and  .  . .  set  aside the\n          sentence and remand the case for further\n          sentencing    proceedings   with    such\n          instructions  as   the  court  considers\n          appropriate.\n\n18 U.S.C.   3742(f) (emphasis added).\n\n          The upshot, as  we have said, is  that in ordinary\n\ncases  the district  court  must apply  the Guidelines.   In\n\nother cases,  the court  may depart  provided that it  gives\n\nreasons for the departure and that the resulting sentence is\n\n\"reasonable.\"  The statute refers to those \"other cases,\" as\n\nthose  where  \"there  exists an  aggravating  or  mitigating\n\ncircumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken\n\ninto consideration  by the Sentencing Commission.\"   But, as\n\nwe  shall  see in  a moment,  in  many cases  this statutory\n\nlimitation, as a practical matter, will have limited impact,\n                          \n\nbecause  the  Commission  itself  admits  that  it  has  not\n\nadequately considered \"unusual\" cases.\n\n                             B\n\n                       The Guidelines\n                                     \n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\n          The  Guidelines deal with departures in four basic\n\nways.\n\n               1.    Cases  Outside the  \"Heartland.\"    The\n                                                   \n\nIntroduction to the Guidelines (which the Commission calls a\n\n\"Policy Statement\") makes an important distinction between a\n\n\"heartland case\"  and an  \"unusual case.\"   The Introduction\n\nsays that the\n\n          Commission intends the sentencing courts\n          to treat each guideline as carving out a\n          \"heartland,\"  a  set  of  typical  cases\n          embodying   the    conduct   that   each\n          guideline describes.\n\nU.S.S.G.  Ch.  I,  Pt.  A,  intro.  comment.  (4)(b).    The\n\nIntroduction goes on to say that when\n\n          a  court finds an  atypical case, one to\n          which     a     particular     guideline\n          linguistically   applies,    but   where\n          conduct  significantly differs  from the\n          norm, the  court may consider  whether a\n          departure is warranted.\n\nId.  The Introduction  further adds that, with a  few stated\n   \n\nexceptions,\n\n          the Commission does not intend  to limit\n          the  kinds  of factors,  whether  or not\n          mentioned    anywhere   else    in   the\n          guidelines,   that    could   constitute\n          grounds  for  departure  in  an  unusual\n          case.\n\nId.\n   \n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\n          The Introduction thus makes clear that (with a few\n\nexceptions)  a case  that falls  outside  the linguistically\n\napplicable  guideline's  \"heartland\"   is  a  candidate  for\n                                                       \n\ndeparture.  It is,  by definition, an \"unusual case.\"   And,\n\nthe sentencing court may then go on to consider, in light of\n\nthe sentencing  system's purposes, see 18  U.S.C.   3553(a),\n                                      \n\n(and the Guidelines themselves) whether or not the \"unusual\"\n\nfeatures of the case justify departure.  \n\n          It  should  now be  apparent  why  we believe  the\n\nstatutory  language  \"adequately  taken into  consideration\"\n\nsometimes has little practical importance.  The statute says\n\nthat the  sentencing court considering a  departure must ask\n\nwhether the Sentencing Commission has \"adequately taken into\n\nconsideration\"  the  aggravating or  mitigating circumstance\n\nthat  seems to  make a  case unusual.   But,  the Commission\n\nitself  has explicitly said that  (with a few exceptions) it\n                           \n\ndid    not   \"adequately\"    take   unusual    cases   \"into\n                                           \n\nconsideration.\"    Of course,  deciding  whether  a case  is\n\n\"unusual\"  will  sometimes  prove  a  difficult  matter  (in\n\nrespect  to which particular  facts, general experience, the\n\nGuidelines  themselves, related  statutes,  and the  general\n\nobjectives of sentencing  all may be  relevant).  But,  once\n\nthe  court, see  pp. 15-17,  infra, has  properly determined\n                                  \n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nthat  a  case  is, indeed,  \"unusual,\"  the  case becomes  a\n\ncandidate  for departure,  for  the  Commission  itself  has\n\nanswered the statutory \"adequate consideration\" question.\n\n          The initial version of the Guidelines, at the risk\n\nof redundancy, made this fact absolutely clear.  It stated:\n\n               The new  sentencing statute permits\n          a  court  to  depart  from  a guideline-\n          specified  sentence  only when  it finds\n          \"an     aggravating    or     mitigating\n          circumstance   .  .   .  that   was  not\n          adequately  taken into  consideration by\n          the Sentencing Commission. . . .\"  Thus,\n                                                  \n          in   principle,   the   Commission,   by\n                                                  \n          specifying   that   it  had   adequately\n                                                  \n          considered  a  particular factor,  could\n                                                  \n          prevent a court from using it as grounds\n                                                  \n          for departure.   In this initial  set of\n                                                  \n          guidelines, however, the Commission does\n                                                  \n          not  so  limit  the   courts'  departure\n                                                  \n          powers.\n                 \n\nU.S.S.G. Ch.  I, Pt. A,  intro. comment. (4)(b)  (Oct. 1987)\n\n(emphasis added)  (citation omitted).  In  later versions of\n\nthe  Guidelines, the  Commission eliminated  the underscored\n\nlanguage.   But, since  the \"unusual case\"  statement (i.e.,\n                                                           \n\nthe statement  that the \"Commission does not intend to limit\n\nthe kinds of factors . . . that could constitute grounds for\n\ndeparture in  an unusual case\") expresses  the same thought,\n\nthe  excision  presumably  reflected  an  intent  to   avoid\n\nredundancy,  not  to  change  the meaning  of  the  section.\n\nIndeed,  the  Commission has  not  suggested  any intent  to\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nchange its meaning.   See U.S.S.G. App. C, amend.  307 (Nov.\n                         \n\n1990)   (\"language  concerning   what  the   Commission,  in\n\nprinciple, might have done is deleted as unnecessary, but no\n\nsubstantive change is made\").  Thus, (with a few exceptions)\n\nthe  law  tells the  judge,  considering  departure, to  ask\n\nbasically, \"Does  this case fall within  the 'heartland,' or\n\nis it an unusual case?\"\n\n               2.    Encouraged  Departures.     In  certain\n                                           \n\ncircumstances,  the  Guidelines  offer the  district  court,\n\nwhich is considering whether  to depart, special assistance,\n\nby  specifically encouraging  departures.   Part 5K  lists a\n\nhost  of  considerations that  may  take  a particular  case\n\noutside the \"heartland\" of  any individual guideline and, in\n\ndoing  so, may warrant a  departure.  See  U.S.S.G.   5K2.0,\n                                         \n\np.s.   The individual guidelines  do not  take account,  for\n\nexample,  of  an  offender's  \"diminished  capacity,\"  which\n\ncircumstance,  in  the  Commission's  view   would  normally\n\nwarrant  a downward departure.  U.S.S.G.   5K2.13, p.s.  Nor\n\ndo  certain guidelines (say, immigration offense guidelines)\n\ntake account of, say, use of a gun, which circumstance would\n\nremove  the situation  (the  immigration offense)  from that\n\nguideline's \"heartland\" and would normally warrant an upward\n\ndeparture.    U.S.S.G       5K2.0,  5K2.6,  p.s.    Specific\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nindividual  guidelines may  also encourage departures.   The\n\nguideline governing transportation of persons for prohibited\n\nsexual conduct, for example, recommends a downward departure\n\nof eight  levels where  the offense involves  neither profit\n\nnor  force.  U.S.S.G.   2G1.1, comment. (n.1).  A sentencing\n\ncourt  facing  such  non-heartland  circumstances  can  feel\n\nconfident, because  of this encouragement,  that a departure\n\nwould not be \"unreasonable.\"  18 U.S.C.   3742(f). \n\n               3.   Discouraged Departures.   The Guidelines\n                                          \n\nsometimes  discourage departures.    Part  5H, for  example,\n\nlists  various \"specific offender\"  characteristics, such as\n\nage,   education,  employment   record,   family  ties   and\n\nresponsibilities,  mental  and   physical  conditions,   and\n\nvarious good works.  The  Guidelines say that these features\n\nare  \"not ordinarily  relevant\"  in determining  departures.\n                    \n\nU.S.S.G.  Ch. 5,  Pt. H  (emphasis added).    The Commission\n\nthereby recognizes that (1)  the individual guidelines (with\n\na few exceptions) do not provide adjustments reflecting such\n\ncircumstances, yet (2)  this fact alone  does not make  such\n                                                 \n\ncircumstances  automatically  sufficient   to  transform   a\n\n\"heartland\"  case   into  an  \"unusual\"   case  outside  the\n\nheartland.  \n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\n          At the same  time, the Commission  recognizes that\n\nsuch circumstances  could remove a case  from the heartland,\n                         \n\nbut only if they are present  in a manner that is unusual or\n\nspecial,  rather  than \"ordinary.\"    See  United States  v.\n                                                        \n\nMerritt, No. 91-1637,  slip op.  at 25-26 (2d  Cir. Feb.  9,\n       \n\n1993).  It  may not be unusual, for example,  to find that a\n\nconvicted  drug  offender is  a  single  mother with  family\n\nresponsibilities,   but,  at  some  point,  the  nature  and\n\nmagnitude  of family  responsibilities (many  children? with\n\nhandicaps?  no  money? no  place  for children  to  go?) may\n\ntransform the  \"ordinary\" case of such  circumstances into a\n\ncase that is not at all ordinary.  \n\n          Thus, a sentencing  court, considering whether  or\n\nnot  the presence  of  these \"discouraged\"  factors warrants\n\ndeparture, must  ask  whether  the  factors  themselves  are\n\npresent  in  unusual kind  or  degree.   The  Commission, in\n\nstating that those factors do  not \"ordinarily\" take a  case\n\noutside the heartland, discourages,  but does not absolutely\n\nforbid, their use.   See, e.g., Merritt, slip op.  at 25-26;\n                                       \n\nUnited States  v. Deigert,  916 F.2d 916,  918-19 (4th  Cir.\n                         \n\n1990).  But see United States v. Thomas, 930  F.2d 526, 529-\n                                       \n\n30   (7th  Cir.)  (forbidding  departures  based  on  family\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nresponsibilities, except  where probation  or  fines are  at\n\nissue), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 171 (1991). \n                    \n\n               4.  Forbidden Departures.  The Commission has\n                                       \n\nmade several explicit exceptions to the basic principle that\n\na sentencing court can consider any \"unusual case\" (any case\n\noutside the  heartland) as a  candidate for departure.   The\n\nGuidelines  state that \"lack of  guidance as a youth\" cannot\n\njustify   departure,  U.S.S.G.      5H1.12,  p.s.,   that  a\n\nsentencing court  \"cannot take  into account as  grounds for\n\ndeparture\" race, sex, national  origin, creed, religion, and\n\nsocio-economic  status.    U.S.S.G.     5H1.10,  p.s.    The\n\nGuidelines  also state that drug  or alcohol abuse  is not a\n\nreason for  imposing a sentence below  the Guidelines range,\n\nU.S.S.G      5H1.4,  p.s.,  and   that  personal   financial\n\ndifficulties and economic pressure  upon a trade or business\n\ndo  not warrant a decrease  in sentence.  U.S.S.G.   5K2.12,\n\np.s.; cf. Williams v.  United States, 112 S. Ct.  1112, 1117\n                                    \n\n(1992)  (under U.S.S.G.    4A1.3,p.s.,  prior arrest  record\n\ncannot provide reliable  evidence of prior criminal  conduct\n\nwarranting upward  departure).  Thus, even  if these factors\n\nmake  a  case \"unusual,\"  taking  it  outside an  individual\n\nguideline's heartland,  the sentencing court is  not free to\n\nconsider departing.   But,  with these nine  exceptions, the\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nsentencing court is  free to consider,  in an unusual  case,\n\nwhether or  not  the factors  that  make it  unusual  (which\n\nremove it from the heartland) are present in sufficient kind\n\nor degree to warrant  a departure.  See U.S.S.G. Ch.  I, Pt.\n                                       \n\nA,  intro. comment. 4(b).  The court retains this freedom to\n\ndepart whether such departure is encouraged, discouraged, or\n\nunconsidered by the Guidelines.\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\n                             C\n\n         The Sentencing Court's Departure Decision\n                                                  \n\n          Given the  statutory provisions, and  the relevant\n\nGuidelines statements,  we suggest  (but we do  not require)\n\nthat, as  an initial matter, a  sentencing court considering\n\ndeparture analyze the case along the following lines:\n\n          1)   What   features   of   this   case,\n          potentially,   take   it   outside   the\n          Guidelines' \"heartland\" and make of it a\n          special, or unusual, case?\n\n          2)   Has    the   Commission   forbidden\n          departures based on those features?\n\n          3) If not, has the Commission encouraged\n          departures based on those features?\n\n          4)   If   not,   has    the   Commission\n          discouraged  departures  based on  those\n          features?\n\nIf no special features  are present, or if  special features\n\nare also \"forbidden\" features, then the sentencing court, in\n\nall likelihood, simply would apply the  relevant guidelines.\n\nIf the special features are \"encouraged\" features, the court\n\nwould likely  depart,  sentencing  in  accordance  with  the\n\nGuidelines'  suggestions.    If  the  special  features  are\n\n\"discouraged\"  features, the  court  would go  on to  decide\n\nwhether  the  case  is  nonetheless  not  \"ordinary,\"  i.e.,\n                                                           \n\nwhether  the case  differs from  the ordinary case  in which\n\nthose  features are present.   If the case  is ordinary, the\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\ncourt would  not depart.  If  it is not ordinary,  the court\n\nwould go on to consider departure.\n\n          Of course, this analysis, by itself, does not help\n\nthe district court decide what to do in situations where the\n\nGuidelines   do   not   expressly   forbid,   encourage,  or\n\ndiscourage, departures.  The Guidelines themselves recognize\n\nthat the  \"[c]ircumstances that may  warrant departure  from\n\nthe  guidelines .  .  . cannot,  by  their very  nature,  be\n\ncomprehensively listed and analyzed in advance.\"  U.S.S.G.  \n\n5K2.0, p.s.   When such unforeseen  circumstances arise, the\n\ndistrict  court will decide  whether to depart  (and, if so,\n\nhow much  to depart)  by examining  the \"unusual\"  nature of\n\nthese  circumstances and  making  a judgment  about what  is\n\nappropriate.   The  structure  and theory  of both  relevant\n\nindividual guidelines  and the  Guidelines taken as  a whole\n\nmay inform that judgment.  The sentencing statute also lists\n\ngenerally relevant sentencing factors, including the \"nature\n\nand  circumstances   of  the  offense,\"  the   \"history  and\n\ncharacteristics of the defendant,\" and the basic purposes of\n\nsentencing,    namely,    just    punishment,    deterrence,\n\nincapacitation  and rehabilitation.    18 U.S.C.    3553(a);\n\nUnited States  v. Merritt, slip op. at  18-19, 25-26 (citing\n                         \n\nDaniel  J.   Freed,  Federal  Sentencing  in   the  Wake  of\n                                                            \n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\nGuidelines:  Unacceptable  Limits   on  the  Discretion   of\n                                                            \n\nSentencers,  101 Yale  L.J.  1681,  1700,  1730-31  (1992)).\n          \n\nUltimately,  however,  the  Guidelines  cannot  dictate  how\n\ncourts should  sentence in  such special, unusual  or other-\n\nthan-ordinary circumstances.  And, that  is as it should be.\n\nAs we have said, see pp.  4-5, supra, the very theory of the\n                                    \n\nGuidelines  system   is  that  when   courts,  drawing  upon\n\nexperience and  informed judgment  in such cases,  decide to\n\ndepart, they will explain  their departures.  The courts  of\n\nappeals, and  the Sentencing  Commission, will  examine, and\n\nlearn  from, those  reasons.   And, the  resulting knowledge\n\nwill  help  the Commission  to  change,  to refine,  and  to\n\nimprove, the  Guidelines themselves.  That is  the theory of\n\npartnership that the Guidelines embody.\n\n                             D\n\n                      Review on Appeal\n                                      \n\n          If  the  district  court decides  to  depart,  the\n\ndefendant may appeal (an upward departure) or the Government\n\nmay appeal (a downward departure).  18 U.S.C.   3742(a),(b);\n\nsee also  United States  v. Pighetti,  898 F.2d  at 4.   The\n                                    \n\nstatute then provides the appellate court with two important\n\ninstructions.  First,  the court of  appeals must decide  if\n\nthe resulting  sentence is \"unreasonable, having regard for\"\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nthe sentencing  court's reasons  and  the statute's  general\n\nsentencing  factors.  18  U.S.C.   3742(e)(3).   Second, the\n\ncourt of appeals must (as it ordinarily does) give \"specific\n\nreasons\" for its decision.   18 U.S.C.   3742(f)(2).   These\n\ntwo  instructions,  taken  together,  help assure  that  the\n\ncourts  of appeals,  with their  more distant,  yet broader,\n\nperspective, will  also play an important  indirect (as well\n\nas  the obvious direct)  role in the  further development of\n\nGuidelines.     They  play  this  \"indirect   role\"  as  the\n\nCommission  examines the  courts of  appeals' decisions  and\n\nreacts, through revision, or reiteration, of the Guidelines.\n\n          The result is a  partnership in which each partner\n\nenjoys  a different  institutional  strength.   The district\n\ncourt may best understand the relation of the  Guidelines to\n\ncase-specific, detailed  facts.   Its experience permits  it\n\ndirectly  to form  a judgment  as to  when certain  kinds of\n\ncircumstances seem better handled by judicial discretion and\n\nhow  courts ought to exercise that discretion.  At the other\n\nend of the spectrum, the Sentencing Commission, by gathering\n\ninformation produced by many individual courts, can view the\n\nsentencing  process   as  a   whole,   developing  a   broad\n\nperspective on  sentencing, which will help  it produce more\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\nconsistent  sentencing  results  among   similarly  situated\n\noffenders  sentenced by  different  courts.   The courts  of\n\nappeals see  sentences from  an intermediate  vantage point.\n\nThey  devote  considerable time  and  effort  to a  district\n\ncourt's determination  in a  particular case, while,  at the\n\nsame time, placing that case within a broader perspective of\n\nsentencing law.\n\n          Recognizing  this relationship, we  have held that\n\nappellate courts  must recognize a degree  of district court\n\nautonomy when  they review certain aspects  of the departure\n\ndecision.  In  United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874  F.2d 43\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir.) cert. denied, 493 U.S. 862 (1989), we pointed out\n                       \n\nthat appellate review  of a decision  to depart may  involve\n\nthree  subsidiary questions:  1)  review of  the  departure-\n\nrelated circumstances  to determine  \"whether  or not\"  they\n\n\"are  of a  kind or  degree that  they may  appropriately be\n\nrelied  upon  to  justify  departure;\"    2) review  of  the\n\nevidence  to  see  if   it  supports  the  departure-related\n\nfindings  of fact; and 3) review of the \"record support\" for\n\n\"the direction  and degree\" of  departure.

We  recognize  that\n              \n\napplication of our  elaboration and modification to  earlier\n\ndecided cases might have meant different results.\n\n          Plenary review is  appropriate where the  question\n\non  review is simply  whether or  not the  allegedly special\n\ncircumstances (i.e.,  the reasons for departure)  are of the\n\n\"kind\"  that  the  Guidelines,   in  principle,  permit  the\n                                              \n\nsentencing  court to consider at all.  As we have previously\n\npointed out, departures  for some  reasons are  \"forbidden,\"\n\nsee  pp.  13-14, supra,  and  departures  for certain  other\n                      \n\nreasons  are \"discouraged\"  unless the  case is  out of  the\n\nordinary, see pp. 12-13,  supra.  Were a district  court (1)\n                               \n\nto try to depart for a \"forbidden\" reason, or were it (2) to\n\ntry to depart for a \"discouraged\" reason without recognizing\n                                                            \n\nthat it must explain  how the case (compared to  other cases\n                                                            \n\nwhere the reason is present) is special, its departure would\n                                       \n\nnot  be lawful.  The district court has no special expertise\n\nin   deciding   whether   a   factor   is   \"forbidden\"   or\n\n\"discouraged.\"  Hence, there  is no reason to review  such a\n\ndecision with any \"leeway\" or \"deference.\"\n\n                            -23-\n                             23\n\n          Plenary  review  is  also  appropriate  where  the\n\nappellate court, in deciding  whether the allegedly  special\n\ncircumstances are  of a \"kind\" that  permits departure, will\n\nhave to  perform the \"quintessentially legal\"  function, see\n                                                            \n\nDiaz-Villafane, 874  F.2d at  49, of  interpreting a  set of\n              \n\nwords,  those of an individual guideline,  in light of their\n\nintention or purpose, in order to identify the nature of the\n\nguideline's \"heartland\"  (to see  if  the allegedly  special\n\ncircumstance falls  within it).  Is  the \"child pornography\"\n\nguideline,  for example,  aimed  only  at child  pornography\n\nconsumers  who are also child molesters, so that a purchaser\n\nwho is  not also a  molester falls outside  its \"heartland?\"\n\nSee  United States v.

Here,  again, the district\n                              \n\ncourt has no special  competence in performing this  kind of\n                    \n\nclassical  textual  analysis.

A district\n\ncourt may well have a special competence in making this kind\n\nof determination,  because it may  have a better  \"feel\" for\n\nthe unique  circumstances of the particular  case before it.\n\nA district court is  also likely to have seen  more ordinary\n                                                            \n\nGuidelines   cases,  for  appellate  courts  hear  only  the\n\ncomparatively  few cases  that  counsel  believe  present  a\n\ncolorable appeal.

Rivera claims\n\nthat this  decision reflects  the  court's incorrect  belief\n\nthat it lacked the legal authority to depart.  And, she asks\n\nus  to order  a  new  proceeding.    See  United  States  v.\n                                                        \n\nCastiello, 915 F.2d  1, 5-6 (1st Cir.  1990) (new proceeding\n         \n\nneeded where district court  wrongly thought it lacked legal\n\npower  to depart,  but  not where  it  simply chose  not  to\n\nexercise  this  authority), cert.  denied,  111  S.

The\n\ndistrict  court's  analysis of  the nature  of its  power to\n\ndepart is not consistent with the view of departures that we\n\nset  forth  in this  opinion.    We recognize  a  difference\n\nbetween \"forbidden  departures,\" see pp.  13-14, supra,  and\n                                                      \n\n\"discouraged  departures,\" see  pp. 12-13,  supra.   And, we\n                                                 \n\nbelieve  that the district court did not realize that it had\n\nthe legal  power to  consider departure, where  departure is\n\ndiscouraged (but not forbidden), if it finds features of the\n\ncase that show it is not ordinary.  See pp. 12-13, supra.\n                                                        \n\n                            -30-\n                             30\n\n          At  the sentencing  hearing,  the  district  court\n\nsaid:\n\n          With  respect  to  Defendant's  argument\n          that  the Defendant's  family situation,\n          economic    situation,    warrants     a\n          departure,   I   must   say   that   the\n          guidelines   are   drawn  to   apply  to\n          everyone in exactly  the same way,  that\n          it is clear from the guidelines that the\n          economic   situation   and  the   family\n          situation  of the  Defendant  is  not  a\n          consideration.    There  are  those  who\n          certainly would disagree with  that, but\n          that is the  principle that is  embodied\n          in the  guidelines.  They are age blind,\n                                                 \n          they  are sex blind,  they are  blind to\n                                                  \n          family circumstances, and can  result in\n                              \n          their application in a certain amount of\n          cruelty.   But, that  isn't a  basis for\n          making  a departure.   It's  a situation\n                                                  \n          where somebody tries  to draw a straight\n                                                  \n          line  that  applies  to every  situation\n                                                  \n          that can possibly  arise and this  Court\n                                                  \n          is without discretion to take what might\n                                                  \n          well  be  thought  by  most  people,  at\n                                                  \n          least,    legitimate    concerns    into\n                                                  \n          consideration.   Simply put, I  can't do\n                                                  \n          that  because  the  guidelines   do  not\n                                                  \n          permit  me   to  do   that.    So   that\n                                     \n          Defendant's objection or request to make\n          a downward departure is denied . . . . \n\n          Your Counsel says that a court somewhere\n          observed that these guidelines are not a\n          straightjacket  for  a  District  Court.\n          Well, I don't agree  with that.  Here is\n          a circumstance where I'm  satisfied that\n          the reason you did  this was to buy toys\n          for your children at Christmas.  It  was\n          a  serious  mistake.   The  pre-sentence\n          report says this:\n\n               There   is    no   information\n               suggesting that Ms. Rivera had\n\n                            -31-\n                             31\n\n               any previous participation  in\n               a   similar    type   criminal\n               activity.     The  Defendant's\n               lifestyle is not indicative of\n               that of a  drug dealer who has\n               profited from ongoing criminal\n               activity.   Rather she appears\n               destitute,  relying on  public\n               assistance to  support herself\n               and her children.\n\n          . . . If I had the authority to do it, I\n                                                  \n          would not impose the sentence that I  am\n                                                  \n          about  to  impose.   I  would  impose  a\n                            \n          lesser  sentence  because  I think  that\n          these guidelines  simply are unrealistic\n          when  applied  to  real life  situations\n          like  this.    They  may  work  in  many\n                                                  \n          circumstances, but  they certainly don't\n                                                  \n          work here.\n                    \n\n(Emphasis added).  \n\n          In these  statements,  the court  repeatedly  said\n\nthat it lacked the  legal power to depart; it  characterized\n\nthe   case   before  it   as   different   from  the   \"many\n\ncircumstances\"  where  the Guidelines  might work;  it added\n\nthat  it  would depart  if it  could;  it set  forth several\n\ncircumstances that might make the case a special one; and it\n\ndescribed  as identical  (\"sex blind\"  and \"blind  to family\n\ncircumstances\")   guidelines   that,    in   fact,    differ\n\nsignificantly, the former involving a \"forbidden\" departure,\n\nand the latter a  \"discouraged\" departure.

On\n\nthe  one hand  lie  a host  of  quite special  circumstances\n\n(though  many  are of  the \"discouraged\"  sort), and  on the\n\nother  hand lies the simple  fact that Ms.  Mirna Rivera did\n\ntransport a  pound of cocaine  from New York  to Providence.\n\nThis is the  kind of case  in which, if  the district  court\n\ndeparts,  its informed views as  to why the  case is special\n\nwould seem  especially useful  and  would warrant  appellate\n\ncourt \"respect.\"  See pp. 23-24, supra.\n                                      \n\n          We remand the case for further proceedings.\n\n                             B\n\n                        Robert Adamo\n                                    \n\n          Mr.  Adamo  was  convicted  of   embezzling  about\n\n$100,000 belonging to  the union Health and  Welfare Fund of\n\nwhich he was a fiduciary,  in violation of 18 U.S.C.    664.\n\nHe accepted responsibility for  the crime, U.S.S.G.   3E1.1.\n\n                            -35-\n                             35\n\nIt was his first offense.  The Guidelines provided a minimum\n\nprison term  of  fifteen months.    See U.S.S.G.      2E5.2,\n                                       \n\n2B1.1,  3B1.3 (base offense level of 4; increase of 8 points\n\nfor  amount of  loss;  2  level  enhancement for  more  than\n\nminimal  planning;  2  level  enhancement   for  fiduciary);\n\nU.S.S.G.  Ch. 5,  Pt.  A (sentencing  table).   The district\n\ncourt, departing downward from the Guidelines, sentenced Mr.\n\nAdamo to probation alone, without any imprisonment. \n\n          The  court gave  the  following  reasons  for  its\n\ndownward departure:\n\n               When  I  look  at  these  cases  of\n          sentencing, the first thing I ask myself\n          is,  \"What sentence  would  I impose  if\n          there were no guidelines?\"   That's what\n          I did for more than 20 years.  And  then\n          I ask myself, \"What's a just sentence in\n          these circumstances?   Am I  going to be\n          limited  by these  artificial guidelines\n          made by people who  have no idea of what\n          kind  of a  case  I'm going  to have  to\n          decide?\"  No two cases are the same. . .\n          . \n\n               So  that's where justice is in this\n          case,  having  restitution made  to this\n          Health &amp;  Welfare Fund.  If  I send this\n          defendant   to   prison  I   think  it's\n          foreordained  that restitution  will not\n          be  made.    It  may  be  made  in  some\n          respect,  but  I'm  sure  the  defendant\n          would lose both his jobs and would  find\n          it  very  difficult  to have  employment\n          which   would   allow   him    to   make\n          restitution.  And a time in prison would\n          serve  no useful  purpose in  this case.\n          The  only  factor  in  sentencing  which\n\n                            -36-\n                             36\n\n          would be accomplished is punishment, but\n          the defendant has  been punished just by\n          being here -- just  being here and  what\n          he's gone through in the last  6 months,\n          and   the  notoriety   of  this.     So,\n          imprisonment serves no useful purpose in\n          this case.  It  certainly isn't a matter\n          of deterrence.   I'm sure  the defendant\n          will never do anything like this again.\n\n               Here is  a  man who  has  lived  an\n          exemplary life, he's worked two  jobs to\n          take care  of his family.   His wife has\n          worked, and although they were making in\n          the range of $70,000 a year, the problem\n          of educating two children came up.  It's\n          a problem  that everyone faces.  This is\n          where  the error  of judgment  comes in.\n          He took  this money,  not out  of greed,\n          not out of desire to own a fancy  car or\n          a  palatial  home  and a  boat,  but  to\n          educate his children.   He didn't  think\n          about  the  other  alternatives.     His\n          daughter  wanted to  go to  an expensive\n          private  school, instead  of going  to a\n          local state school of  some sort, and he\n          thought that's what she should have.  He\n          didn't consider loans and other types of\n          programs.  This  money was available, he\n          took  it  -- a  terrible  mistake.   But\n          that's the only mistake that he seems to\n          have made,  and  I just  don't think  he\n          should  spend time in  prison because of\n          this one mistake.\n\n               I  want  restitution  made, so  I'm\n          going  to exercise  my best  judgment in\n          these circumstances.   My best  judgment\n          is to  have as long a  term of probation\n          as possible so  that restitution can  be\n          made with the  guidance of the probation\n          office.\n\n               So,  I'm  going to  depart downward\n          and  impose  a  term of  probation  of 5\n          years.   That's the  maximum that  I can\n\n                            -37-\n                             37\n\n          impose.   And  one of the  conditions of\n          probation  will  be,  and is,  that  the\n          defendant shall pay  restitution in  the\n          amount  of  $91,125.62 to  the  Health &amp;\n          Welfare  Fund  of  the Building  Service\n          Employees  International Union,  AFL-CIO\n          Local 334.\n\n          The court's explication of its  reasons is useful,\n\nfor  it produces understanding  and permits evaluation, both\n\nby  appellate courts and by  the Commission.  We nonetheless\n\nbelieve the  analysis does  not permit the  departure before\n\nus.\n\n          First, we believe (deciding the question as a pure\n\nmatter of law,  see pp. 21-22, supra) that  the embezzlement\n                                    \n\nguidelines encompass, within their \"heartland,\" embezzlement\n\naccompanied by normal  restitution needs and  practicalities\n                     \n\n(i.e., the  simple facts  that restitution is  desirable and\n     \n\nthat a prison term will make restitution harder to achieve).\n\nIt  would  seem   obvious,  and  no  one  denies,  that  the\n\nembezzlement guidelines  are written  for ordinary  cases of\n\nembezzlement, that  restitution is  called for in  many such\n\ncases, and that prison terms often make restitution somewhat\n\nmore  difficult  to  achieve.    Moreover, the  embezzlement\n\nguideline  reflects  the  Commission's  intent  to  equalize\n\npunishments for \"white collar\" and \"blue collar\" crime.  See\n                                                            \n\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Supplementary Report on\n                                                            \n\n                            -38-\n                             38\n\nthe Initial Sentencing  Guidelines and Policy  Statements 18\n                                                         \n\n(1987); Hearings  Before the Senate Comm.  on the Judiciary,\n                                                           \n\n100th  Cong., 1st Sess. 54-55  (October 22, 1987).   Yet, as\n\nthe Sixth Circuit has pointed out, \n\n          a  rule  permitting greater  leniency in\n          sentencing  in  those  cases   in  which\n          restitution  is   at  issue  and   is  a\n                                          \n          meaningful possibility  (i.e., generally\n          white collar crimes) would . . . nurture\n          the  unfortunate  practice of  disparate\n          sentencing   based   on   socio-economic\n          status,   which   the  guidelines   were\n          intended to supplant.\n\nUnited States v. Harpst,  949 F.2d 860, 863 (6th  Cir. 1991)\n                       \n\n(citing U.S.S.G.    5H1.10, p.s. (socio-economic  status not\n\nrelevant  in  determination  of  sentence)).   Further,  the\n\ndistrict court itself, stating  that it did not wish  \"to be\n\nlimited by  these artificial  guidelines,\" and that  \"no two\n\ncases are alike,\" seemed to disregard, rather than  to deny,\n\nthe scope of the embezzlement guideline.  For these reasons,\n\nwe join  the  Fourth and  Sixth  Circuits, in  holding  that\n\nordinary restitution circumstances of  this sort do not fall\n        \n\noutside  the  embezzlement   guideline's  \"heartland,\"   and\n\ntherefore  do not warrant a downward departure.  See Harpst,\n                                                           \n\n949 F.2d at  863; United  States v. Bolden,  889 F.2d  1336,\n                                          \n\n1340 (4th Cir. 1989).\n\n                            -39-\n                             39\n\n          Second,  we recognize  that  a special  need of  a\n                                                \n\nvictim for restitution, and the  surrounding practicalities,\n\nmight, in an  unusual case,  justify a departure.   But,  we\n\ncannot review a district  court determination to that effect\n\nhere,  for the  district court  made no  such determination.\n\n(Although,  had  it  done  so,  we  would  have treated  its\n\ndetermination with \"respect.\"   See pp.  23-24, supra.)   We\n                                                     \n\nmention this fact because the  defendant has pointed to  one\n\nunusual  feature of the case.  The record before us contains\n\na  suggestion  that  Mr.  Adamo  could  keep  his  job  (and\n\ntherefore remain  able to make restitution)  were his prison\n\nterm only one year, but he  could not keep his job (and thus\n\nwould  lose  his  ability   to  make  restitution)  were  he\n\nsentenced  to the  Guidelines prison  term of  one year  and\n\nthree  months.   We  can imagine  an argument  for departure\n\nresting  upon a  strong need  for restitution,  an important\n\npractical advantage to the  lesser sentence, and a departure\n\nlimited to three months.  \n\n          We are not urging such a  departure or saying that\n\nwe  would eventually find it lawful.  We mention the special\n\ncircumstance to  underscore the need  for reasoned departure\n\nanalysis, sensitive to the way in which the Guidelines  seek\n\nto structure departure  decisions and to the  role that such\n\n                            -40-\n                             40\n\ndepartures, and their accompanying  reasons, can play in the\n\ncontinued development of the Sentencing Guidelines.  We have\n\nexplained why  the district court's analysis,  about how the\n\nfeatures  of a case make it unusual, can help both reviewing\n\ncourts  and the  Commission  itself.   See  pp. 4-5,  18-19,\n                                          \n\nsupra.  The district court, in Mr. Adamo's case, may wish to\n     \n\nconduct such an analysis in light of the special features of\n\nthe case to which the defendant has pointed.\n\n          We therefore remand this  case for new  sentencing\n\nproceedings.\n\n          The sentences  in both  cases are vacated  and the\n                                                            \n\ncases are remanded to the district court for resentencing.\n                                                          \n\n          So ordered. \n                     \n\n                            -41-\n                             41\n",

Each of these  two appeals\n                              \n\nconcerns  the district  court's power  to impose  a sentence\n\nthat departs from the Sentencing Guidelines.  The first case\n\ninvolves  Mirna  Rivera,  a  single mother  of  three  small\n\nchildren.   Ms.  Rivera was  convicted of  carrying about  a\n\npound of cocaine from  New York to Providence.   She appeals\n\nher thirty-three month sentence of imprisonment.  She argues\n\nthat the  district court  would have departed  downward from\n\nthe minimum  thirty-three month  Guidelines prison term  but\n\nfor the court's view that it lacked the legal \"authority\" to\n\ndepart.   She says that this view is legally \"incorrect,\" 18\n\nU.S.C.    3742(f)(1),  and she  asks  us  to set  aside  her\n\nsentence.\n\n          The second case involves a union official,  Robert\n\nAdamo, who embezzled about  $100,000 from his union's Health\n\nand Welfare Fund.  The district court departed downward from\n\nthe  fifteen  to  twenty-one  month  prison  term  that  the\n\nGuidelines  themselves would  have required.   Instead,  the\n\ncourt imposed a term of probation  without confinement.  The\n\ncourt  said that it was departing downward so that Mr. Adamo\n\ncould  continue to work and to make restitution to the Fund.\n\nThe  Government   appeals.      It   argues   that   Adamo's\n\ncircumstancesare insufficientlyunusualtowarrantthedeparture.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n          We agree with  the appellants in  both cases.   In\n\nour view, the  district court sentencing Ms. Rivera  held an\n\nunduly narrow  view of its  departure powers.   The district\n\ncourt sentencing Mr.  Adamo failed to  analyze the need  for\n\ndeparture in the  way that  the law requires.   We  consider\n\nboth  cases in this single opinion because doing so may help\n\nto    illustrate   an   appropriate   legal   analysis   for\n\n\"departures.\"   We  shall first  set forth  our view  of the\n\nportion  of the law here applicable; and we shall then apply\n\nthat law to the two appeals.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Departures\n                                   \n\n          The basic theory of the Sentencing Guidelines is a\n\nsimple  one.   In  order  to  lessen  the  degree  to  which\n\ndifferent judges  imposed different sentences  in comparable\n\ncases,   an   expert  Sentencing   Commission   would  write\n\nGuidelines,   applicable   to   most   ordinary   sentencing\n\nsituations.  See S. Rep.  No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess.  38,\n                \n\n51, 161  (1984), reprinted in 1984  U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3221,\n                             \n\n3234, 3344.  In an ordinary situation, the statutes, and the\n\nGuidelines themselves, would require  the judge to apply the\n\nappropriate guideline  -- a  guideline  that would  normally\n\ncabin,  within fairly  narrow limits,  the judge's  power to\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nchoose  the  length  of   a  prison  term.    18   U.S.C.   \n\n3553(a),(b).  Should the judge face a situation that was not\n\nordinary,  the  judge  could   depart  from  the  Guidelines\n\nsentence,  provided  that  the  judge then  sets  forth  the\n\nreasons for departure.   18 U.S.C.   3553(b),(c).    A court\n\nof appeals would review the departure  for \"reasonableness.\"\n\n18  U.S.C.   3742.  And, the Commission itself would collect\n\nand study both the district courts' departure determinations\n\nand the courts of appeals' decisions, thereby learning about\n\nthe Guidelines' actual workings  and using that knowledge to\n\nhelp revise or clarify  the Guidelines for the future.   See\n                                                            \n\nS. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong.,  2d Sess. 80, 151, reprinted in\n                                                            \n\n1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at 3263,  3334;  U.S.S.G. Ch.  1, Pt.  A,\n\nintro. comment 4(b).\n\n          This  basic   theory  is  embodied   in  statutory\n\nprovisions and in  the Guidelines themselves.  We believe it\n\nimportant to refer to this theory in explaining our own view\n\nof the  legal provisions  concerning departures, and  of how\n\nboth  district  courts and  courts of  appeals are  to apply\n\nthem.\n\n                             A\n\n                        The Statute\n                                   \n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\n          The Sentencing Statute itself sets forth the basic\n\nlaw  governing departures.   It  tells the  sentencing court\n\nthat it\n\n          shall impose a sentence of the kind, and\n                      \n          within the range  . . .  established for\n          the   applicable  category   of  offense\n          committed by the applicable  category of\n          defendant as set forth in the guidelines\n          . . . . \n\n18 U.S.C.    3553(b) (incorporating 18  U.S.C.   3553(a)(4))\n\n(emphasis added).  The statute goes on immediately to create\n\nan exception  for departures  by adding that  the sentencing\n\ncourt shall \"impose\" this Guidelines sentence\n\n          unless the court finds that there exists\n                \n          an     aggravating     or     mitigating\n          circumstance of  a kind, or to a degree,\n          not adequately  taken into consideration\n          by   the    Sentencing   Commission   in\n          formulating  the guidelines  that should\n          result in a sentence different from that\n          described.\n\n18  U.S.C.   3553(b) (emphasis  added).    If the sentencing\n\ncourt  makes   this  finding  and  sentences   \"outside  the\n\n[Guidelines] range,\" it must \n\n          state in  open court . .  . the specific\n          reason for the  imposition of a sentence\n          different  from  that described  [in the\n          guidelines]. \n\n18  U.S.C.    3553(c).

Cases  Outside the  \"Heartland.\"    The\n                                                   \n\nIntroduction to the Guidelines (which the Commission calls a\n\n\"Policy Statement\") makes an important distinction between a\n\n\"heartland case\"  and an  \"unusual case.\"   The Introduction\n\nsays that the\n\n          Commission intends the sentencing courts\n          to treat each guideline as carving out a\n          \"heartland,\"  a  set  of  typical  cases\n          embodying   the    conduct   that   each\n          guideline describes.\n\nU.S.S.G.  Ch.  I,  Pt.  A,  intro.  comment.  (4)(b).    The\n\nIntroduction goes on to say that when\n\n          a  court finds an  atypical case, one to\n          which     a     particular     guideline\n          linguistically   applies,    but   where\n          conduct  significantly differs  from the\n          norm, the  court may consider  whether a\n          departure is warranted.\n\nId.  The Introduction  further adds that, with a  few stated\n   \n\nexceptions,\n\n          the Commission does not intend  to limit\n          the  kinds  of factors,  whether  or not\n          mentioned    anywhere   else    in   the\n          guidelines,   that    could   constitute\n          grounds  for  departure  in  an  unusual\n          case.\n\nId.\n   \n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\n          The Introduction thus makes clear that (with a few\n\nexceptions)  a case  that falls  outside  the linguistically\n\napplicable  guideline's  \"heartland\"   is  a  candidate  for\n                                                       \n\ndeparture.  It is,  by definition, an \"unusual case.\"   And,\n\nthe sentencing court may then go on to consider, in light of\n\nthe sentencing  system's purposes, see 18  U.S.C.   3553(a),\n                                      \n\n(and the Guidelines themselves) whether or not the \"unusual\"\n\nfeatures of the case justify departure.  \n\n          It  should  now be  apparent  why  we believe  the\n\nstatutory  language  \"adequately  taken into  consideration\"\n\nsometimes has little practical importance.  The statute says\n\nthat the  sentencing court considering a  departure must ask\n\nwhether the Sentencing Commission has \"adequately taken into\n\nconsideration\"  the  aggravating or  mitigating circumstance\n\nthat  seems to  make a  case unusual.   But,  the Commission\n\nitself  has explicitly said that  (with a few exceptions) it\n                           \n\ndid    not   \"adequately\"    take   unusual    cases   \"into\n                                           \n\nconsideration.\"    Of course,  deciding  whether  a case  is\n\n\"unusual\"  will  sometimes  prove  a  difficult  matter  (in\n\nrespect  to which particular  facts, general experience, the\n\nGuidelines  themselves, related  statutes,  and the  general\n\nobjectives of sentencing  all may be  relevant).  But,  once\n\nthe  court, see  pp. 15-17,  infra, has  properly determined\n                                  \n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nthat  a  case  is, indeed,  \"unusual,\"  the  case becomes  a\n\ncandidate  for departure,  for  the  Commission  itself  has\n\nanswered the statutory \"adequate consideration\" question.\n\n          The initial version of the Guidelines, at the risk\n\nof redundancy, made this fact absolutely clear.  It stated:\n\n               The new  sentencing statute permits\n          a  court  to  depart  from  a guideline-\n          specified  sentence  only when  it finds\n          \"an     aggravating    or     mitigating\n          circumstance   .  .   .  that   was  not\n          adequately  taken into  consideration by\n          the Sentencing Commission. . . .\"  Thus,\n                                                  \n          in   principle,   the   Commission,   by\n                                                  \n          specifying   that   it  had   adequately\n                                                  \n          considered  a  particular factor,  could\n                                                  \n          prevent a court from using it as grounds\n                                                  \n          for departure.   In this initial  set of\n                                                  \n          guidelines, however, the Commission does\n                                                  \n          not  so  limit  the   courts'  departure\n                                                  \n          powers.\n                 \n\nU.S.S.G. Ch.  I, Pt. A,  intro. comment. (4)(b)  (Oct. 1987)\n\n(emphasis added)  (citation omitted).  In  later versions of\n\nthe  Guidelines, the  Commission eliminated  the underscored\n\nlanguage.   But, since  the \"unusual case\"  statement (i.e.,\n                                                           \n\nthe statement  that the \"Commission does not intend to limit\n\nthe kinds of factors . . . that could constitute grounds for\n\ndeparture in  an unusual case\") expresses  the same thought,\n\nthe  excision  presumably  reflected  an  intent  to   avoid\n\nredundancy,  not  to  change  the meaning  of  the  section.\n\nIndeed,  the  Commission has  not  suggested  any intent  to\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nchange its meaning.   See U.S.S.G. App. C, amend.  307 (Nov.\n                         \n\n1990)   (\"language  concerning   what  the   Commission,  in\n\nprinciple, might have done is deleted as unnecessary, but no\n\nsubstantive change is made\").  Thus, (with a few exceptions)\n\nthe  law  tells the  judge,  considering  departure, to  ask\n\nbasically, \"Does  this case fall within  the 'heartland,' or\n\nis it an unusual case?\"\n\n               2.    Encouraged  Departures.     In  certain\n                                           \n\ncircumstances,  the  Guidelines  offer the  district  court,\n\nwhich is considering whether  to depart, special assistance,\n\nby  specifically encouraging  departures.   Part 5K  lists a\n\nhost  of  considerations that  may  take  a particular  case\n\noutside the \"heartland\" of  any individual guideline and, in\n\ndoing  so, may warrant a  departure.  See  U.S.S.G.   5K2.0,\n                                         \n\np.s.   The individual guidelines  do not  take account,  for\n\nexample,  of  an  offender's  \"diminished  capacity,\"  which\n\ncircumstance,  in  the  Commission's  view   would  normally\n\nwarrant  a downward departure.  U.S.S.G.   5K2.13, p.s.  Nor\n\ndo  certain guidelines (say, immigration offense guidelines)\n\ntake account of, say, use of a gun, which circumstance would\n\nremove  the situation  (the  immigration offense)  from that\n\nguideline's \"heartland\" and would normally warrant an upward\n\ndeparture.    U.S.S.G       5K2.0,  5K2.6,  p.s.    Specific\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\nindividual  guidelines may  also encourage departures.   The\n\nguideline governing transportation of persons for prohibited\n\nsexual conduct, for example, recommends a downward departure\n\nof eight  levels where  the offense involves  neither profit\n\nnor  force.  U.S.S.G.   2G1.1, comment. (n.1).  A sentencing\n\ncourt  facing  such  non-heartland  circumstances  can  feel\n\nconfident, because  of this encouragement,  that a departure\n\nwould not be \"unreasonable.\"  18 U.S.C.   3742(f). \n\n               3.   Discouraged Departures.   The Guidelines\n                                          \n\nsometimes  discourage departures.    Part  5H, for  example,\n\nlists  various \"specific offender\"  characteristics, such as\n\nage,   education,  employment   record,   family  ties   and\n\nresponsibilities,  mental  and   physical  conditions,   and\n\nvarious good works.  The  Guidelines say that these features\n\nare  \"not ordinarily  relevant\"  in determining  departures.\n                    \n\nU.S.S.G.  Ch. 5,  Pt. H  (emphasis added).    The Commission\n\nthereby recognizes that (1)  the individual guidelines (with\n\na few exceptions) do not provide adjustments reflecting such\n\ncircumstances, yet (2)  this fact alone  does not make  such\n                                                 \n\ncircumstances  automatically  sufficient   to  transform   a\n\n\"heartland\"  case   into  an  \"unusual\"   case  outside  the\n\nheartland.  \n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\n          At the same  time, the Commission  recognizes that\n\nsuch circumstances  could remove a case  from the heartland,\n                         \n\nbut only if they are present  in a manner that is unusual or\n\nspecial,  rather  than \"ordinary.\"    See  United States  v.\n                                                        \n\nMerritt, No. 91-1637,  slip op.  at 25-26 (2d  Cir. Feb.  9,\n       \n\n1993).  It  may not be unusual, for example,  to find that a\n\nconvicted  drug  offender is  a  single  mother with  family\n\nresponsibilities,   but,  at  some  point,  the  nature  and\n\nmagnitude  of family  responsibilities (many  children? with\n\nhandicaps?  no  money? no  place  for children  to  go?) may\n\ntransform the  \"ordinary\" case of such  circumstances into a\n\ncase that is not at all ordinary.  \n\n          Thus, a sentencing  court, considering whether  or\n\nnot  the presence  of  these \"discouraged\"  factors warrants\n\ndeparture, must  ask  whether  the  factors  themselves  are\n\npresent  in  unusual kind  or  degree.   The  Commission, in\n\nstating that those factors do  not \"ordinarily\" take a  case\n\noutside the heartland, discourages,  but does not absolutely\n\nforbid, their use.

The Commission has\n                                       \n\nmade several explicit exceptions to the basic principle that\n\na sentencing court can consider any \"unusual case\" (any case\n\noutside the  heartland) as a  candidate for departure.   The\n\nGuidelines  state that \"lack of  guidance as a youth\" cannot\n\njustify   departure,  U.S.S.G.      5H1.12,  p.s.,   that  a\n\nsentencing court  \"cannot take  into account as  grounds for\n\ndeparture\" race, sex, national  origin, creed, religion, and\n\nsocio-economic  status.    U.S.S.G.     5H1.10,  p.s.    The\n\nGuidelines  also state that drug  or alcohol abuse  is not a\n\nreason for  imposing a sentence below  the Guidelines range,\n\nU.S.S.G      5H1.4,  p.s.,  and   that  personal   financial\n\ndifficulties and economic pressure  upon a trade or business\n\ndo  not warrant a decrease  in sentence.  U.S.S.G.   5K2.12,\n\np.s.; cf. Williams v.  United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112704\"><a href=\"/opinion/112704/williams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, even  if these factors\n\nmake  a  case \"unusual,\"  taking  it  outside an  individual\n\nguideline's heartland,  the sentencing court is  not free to\n\nconsider departing.   But,  with these nine  exceptions, the\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nsentencing court is  free to consider,  in an unusual  case,\n\nwhether or  not  the factors  that  make it  unusual  (which\n\nremove it from the heartland) are present in sufficient kind\n\nor degree to warrant  a departure.

The court retains this freedom to\n\ndepart whether such departure is encouraged, discouraged, or\n\nunconsidered by the Guidelines.\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\n                             C\n\n         The Sentencing Court's Departure Decision\n                                                  \n\n          Given the  statutory provisions, and  the relevant\n\nGuidelines statements,  we suggest  (but we do  not require)\n\nthat, as  an initial matter, a  sentencing court considering\n\ndeparture analyze the case along the following lines:\n\n          1)   What   features   of   this   case,\n          potentially,   take   it   outside   the\n          Guidelines' \"heartland\" and make of it a\n          special, or unusual, case?\n\n          2)   Has    the   Commission   forbidden\n          departures based on those features?\n\n          3) If not, has the Commission encouraged\n          departures based on those features?\n\n          4)   If   not,   has    the   Commission\n          discouraged  departures  based on  those\n          features?\n\nIf no special features  are present, or if  special features\n\nare also \"forbidden\" features, then the sentencing court, in\n\nall likelihood, simply would apply the  relevant guidelines.\n\nIf the special features are \"encouraged\" features, the court\n\nwould likely  depart,  sentencing  in  accordance  with  the\n\nGuidelines'  suggestions.    If  the  special  features  are\n\n\"discouraged\"  features, the  court  would go  on to  decide\n\nwhether  the  case  is  nonetheless  not  \"ordinary,\"  i.e.,\n                                                           \n\nwhether  the case  differs from  the ordinary case  in which\n\nthose  features are present.   If the case  is ordinary, the\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\ncourt would  not depart.  If  it is not ordinary,  the court\n\nwould go on to consider departure.\n\n          Of course, this analysis, by itself, does not help\n\nthe district court decide what to do in situations where the\n\nGuidelines   do   not   expressly   forbid,   encourage,  or\n\ndiscourage, departures.  The Guidelines themselves recognize\n\nthat the  \"[c]ircumstances that may  warrant departure  from\n\nthe  guidelines .  .  . cannot,  by  their very  nature,  be\n\ncomprehensively listed and analyzed in advance.\"  U.S.S.G.  \n\n5K2.0, p.s.   When such unforeseen  circumstances arise, the\n\ndistrict  court will decide  whether to depart  (and, if so,\n\nhow much  to depart)  by examining  the \"unusual\"  nature of\n\nthese  circumstances and  making  a judgment  about what  is\n\nappropriate.   The  structure  and theory  of both  relevant\n\nindividual guidelines  and the  Guidelines taken as  a whole\n\nmay inform that judgment.  The sentencing statute also lists\n\ngenerally relevant sentencing factors, including the \"nature\n\nand  circumstances   of  the  offense,\"  the   \"history  and\n\ncharacteristics of the defendant,\" and the basic purposes of\n\nsentencing,    namely,    just    punishment,    deterrence,\n\nincapacitation  and rehabilitation.    18 U.S.C.    3553(a);\n\nUnited States  v. Merritt, slip op. at  18-19, 25-26 (citing\n                         \n\nDaniel  J.   Freed,  Federal  Sentencing  in   the  Wake  of\n                                                            \n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\nGuidelines:  Unacceptable  Limits   on  the  Discretion   of\n                                                            \n\nSentencers,  101 Yale  L.J.  1681,  1700,  1730-31  (1992)).\n          \n\nUltimately,  however,  the  Guidelines  cannot  dictate  how\n\ncourts should  sentence in  such special, unusual  or other-\n\nthan-ordinary circumstances.  And, that  is as it should be.\n\nAs we have said, see pp.  4-5, supra, the very theory of the\n                                    \n\nGuidelines  system   is  that  when   courts,  drawing  upon\n\nexperience and  informed judgment  in such cases,  decide to\n\ndepart, they will explain  their departures.  The courts  of\n\nappeals, and  the Sentencing  Commission, will  examine, and\n\nlearn  from, those  reasons.   And, the  resulting knowledge\n\nwill  help  the Commission  to  change,  to refine,  and  to\n\nimprove, the  Guidelines themselves.  That is  the theory of\n\npartnership that the Guidelines embody.\n\n                             D\n\n                      Review on Appeal\n                                      \n\n          If  the  district  court decides  to  depart,  the\n\ndefendant may appeal (an upward departure) or the Government\n\nmay appeal (a downward departure).  18 U.S.C.   3742(a),(b);\n\nsee also  United States  v. Pighetti,  898 F.2d  at 4.   The\n                                    \n\nstatute then provides the appellate court with two important\n\ninstructions.  First,  the court of  appeals must decide  if\n\nthe resulting  sentence is \"unreasonable, having regard for\"\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nthe sentencing  court's reasons  and  the statute's  general\n\nsentencing  factors.  18  U.S.C.   3742(e)(3).   Second, the\n\ncourt of appeals must (as it ordinarily does) give \"specific\n\nreasons\" for its decision.   18 U.S.C.   3742(f)(2).   These\n\ntwo  instructions,  taken  together,  help assure  that  the\n\ncourts  of appeals,  with their  more distant,  yet broader,\n\nperspective, will  also play an important  indirect (as well\n\nas  the obvious direct)  role in the  further development of\n\nGuidelines.     They  play  this  \"indirect   role\"  as  the\n\nCommission  examines the  courts of  appeals' decisions  and\n\nreacts, through revision, or reiteration, of the Guidelines.\n\n          The result is a  partnership in which each partner\n\nenjoys  a different  institutional  strength.   The district\n\ncourt may best understand the relation of the  Guidelines to\n\ncase-specific, detailed  facts.   Its experience permits  it\n\ndirectly  to form  a judgment  as to  when certain  kinds of\n\ncircumstances seem better handled by judicial discretion and\n\nhow  courts ought to exercise that discretion.  At the other\n\nend of the spectrum, the Sentencing Commission, by gathering\n\ninformation produced by many individual courts, can view the\n\nsentencing  process   as  a   whole,   developing  a   broad\n\nperspective on  sentencing, which will help  it produce more\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\nconsistent  sentencing  results  among   similarly  situated\n\noffenders  sentenced by  different  courts.   The courts  of\n\nappeals see  sentences from  an intermediate  vantage point.\n\nThey  devote  considerable time  and  effort  to a  district\n\ncourt's determination  in a  particular case, while,  at the\n\nsame time, placing that case within a broader perspective of\n\nsentencing law.\n\n          Recognizing  this relationship, we  have held that\n\nappellate courts  must recognize a degree  of district court\n\nautonomy when  they review certain aspects  of the departure\n\ndecision.

We  recognize  that\n              \n\napplication of our  elaboration and modification to  earlier\n\ndecided cases might have meant different results.\n\n          Plenary review is  appropriate where the  question\n\non  review is simply  whether or  not the  allegedly special\n\ncircumstances (i.e.,  the reasons for departure)  are of the\n\n\"kind\"  that  the  Guidelines,   in  principle,  permit  the\n                                              \n\nsentencing  court to consider at all.  As we have previously\n\npointed out, departures  for some  reasons are  \"forbidden,\"\n\nsee  pp.  13-14, supra,  and  departures  for certain  other\n                      \n\nreasons  are \"discouraged\"  unless the  case is  out of  the\n\nordinary, see pp. 12-13,  supra.

The district court has no special expertise\n\nin   deciding   whether   a   factor   is   \"forbidden\"   or\n\n\"discouraged.\"  Hence, there  is no reason to review  such a\n\ndecision with any \"leeway\" or \"deference.\"\n\n                            -23-\n                             23\n\n          Plenary  review  is  also  appropriate  where  the\n\nappellate court, in deciding  whether the allegedly  special\n\ncircumstances are  of a \"kind\" that  permits departure, will\n\nhave to  perform the \"quintessentially legal\"  function, see\n                                                            \n\nDiaz-Villafane, 874  F.2d at  49, of  interpreting a  set of\n              \n\nwords,  those of an individual guideline,  in light of their\n\nintention or purpose, in order to identify the nature of the\n\nguideline's \"heartland\"  (to see  if  the allegedly  special\n\ncircumstance falls  within it).

A district\n\ncourt may well have a special competence in making this kind\n\nof determination,  because it may  have a better  \"feel\" for\n\nthe unique  circumstances of the particular  case before it.\n\nA district court is  also likely to have seen  more ordinary\n                                                            \n\nGuidelines   cases,  for  appellate  courts  hear  only  the\n\ncomparatively  few cases  that  counsel  believe  present  a\n\ncolorable appeal.

The Guidelines  provide a\n\nsentence  of 33 to 41  months imprisonment for  a first time\n\noffender who  has  engaged in  this conduct.   See  U.S.S.G.\n                                                  \n\n  2D1.1(a)(3)(c)(10)  (base offense  level of  24); U.S.S.G.\n\n  3B1.2(a)    (reduction   of    4   points    for   minimal\n\nparticipation); U.S.S.G.  Ch. 5,  Pt. A  (sentencing table).\n\nMs.  Rivera argued  to  the district  court  that it  should\n\ndepart  downward  from  this  Guidelines  sentence  for  the\n\nfollowing reasons:\n\n          1)  she has  three small  children, ages\n          three,   five,  and  six,   who  need  a\n          mother's care;\n\n          2)   she   lives   solely  on   welfare,\n          receiving  no  financial  aid  from  her\n          former husband;\n\n          3) she has virtually no contact with any\n          other  family  member   (except  for   a\n          sister,  with  five  children,  also  on\n          welfare);\n\n          4) she  has never before engaged  in any\n          criminal activity;\n          and,\n\n                            -29-\n                             29\n\n          5)  she  committed  this single  offense\n          because  of  an  unwise wish  to  obtain\n          money  for  Christmas  presents for  her\n          children.\n\nThe  district court decided  not to  depart.   Rivera claims\n\nthat this  decision reflects  the  court's incorrect  belief\n\nthat it lacked the legal authority to depart.  And, she asks\n\nus  to order  a  new  proceeding.    See  United  States  v.\n                                                        \n\nCastiello, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548680\"><a href=\"/opinion/548680/united-states-v-giovanni-castiello/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5-6 (1st Cir.  1990) (new proceeding\n         \n\nneeded where district court  wrongly thought it lacked legal\n\npower  to depart,  but  not where  it  simply chose  not  to\n\nexercise  this  authority), cert.  denied,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The\n\ndistrict  court's  analysis of  the nature  of its  power to\n\ndepart is not consistent with the view of departures that we\n\nset  forth  in this  opinion.    We recognize  a  difference\n\nbetween \"forbidden  departures,\" see pp.  13-14, supra,  and\n                                                      \n\n\"discouraged  departures,\" see  pp. 12-13,  supra.   And, we\n                                                 \n\nbelieve  that the district court did not realize that it had\n\nthe legal  power to  consider departure, where  departure is\n\ndiscouraged (but not forbidden), if it finds features of the\n\ncase that show it is not ordinary.  See pp. 12-13, supra.\n                                                        \n\n                            -30-\n                             30\n\n          At  the sentencing  hearing,  the  district  court\n\nsaid:\n\n          With  respect  to  Defendant's  argument\n          that  the Defendant's  family situation,\n          economic    situation,    warrants     a\n          departure,   I   must   say   that   the\n          guidelines   are   drawn  to   apply  to\n          everyone in exactly  the same way,  that\n          it is clear from the guidelines that the\n          economic   situation   and  the   family\n          situation  of the  Defendant  is  not  a\n          consideration.    There  are  those  who\n          certainly would disagree with  that, but\n          that is the  principle that is  embodied\n          in the  guidelines.  They are age blind,\n                                                 \n          they  are sex blind,  they are  blind to\n                                                  \n          family circumstances, and can  result in\n                              \n          their application in a certain amount of\n          cruelty.   But, that  isn't a  basis for\n          making  a departure.   It's  a situation\n                                                  \n          where somebody tries  to draw a straight\n                                                  \n          line  that  applies  to every  situation\n                                                  \n          that can possibly  arise and this  Court\n                                                  \n          is without discretion to take what might\n                                                  \n          well  be  thought  by  most  people,  at\n                                                  \n          least,    legitimate    concerns    into\n                                                  \n          consideration.   Simply put, I  can't do\n                                                  \n          that  because  the  guidelines   do  not\n                                                  \n          permit  me   to  do   that.    So   that\n                                     \n          Defendant's objection or request to make\n          a downward departure is denied . . . . \n\n          Your Counsel says that a court somewhere\n          observed that these guidelines are not a\n          straightjacket  for  a  District  Court.\n          Well, I don't agree  with that.  Here is\n          a circumstance where I'm  satisfied that\n          the reason you did  this was to buy toys\n          for your children at Christmas.  It  was\n          a  serious  mistake.   The  pre-sentence\n          report says this:\n\n               There   is    no   information\n               suggesting that Ms. Rivera had\n\n                            -31-\n                             31\n\n               any previous participation  in\n               a   similar    type   criminal\n               activity.     The  Defendant's\n               lifestyle is not indicative of\n               that of a  drug dealer who has\n               profited from ongoing criminal\n               activity.   Rather she appears\n               destitute,  relying on  public\n               assistance to  support herself\n               and her children.\n\n          . . . If I had the authority to do it, I\n                                                  \n          would not impose the sentence that I  am\n                                                  \n          about  to  impose.   I  would  impose  a\n                            \n          lesser  sentence  because  I think  that\n          these guidelines  simply are unrealistic\n          when  applied  to  real life  situations\n          like  this.    They  may  work  in  many\n                                                  \n          circumstances, but  they certainly don't\n                                                  \n          work here.\n                    \n\n(Emphasis added).  \n\n          In these  statements,  the court  repeatedly  said\n\nthat it lacked the  legal power to depart; it  characterized\n\nthe   case   before  it   as   different   from  the   \"many\n\ncircumstances\"  where  the Guidelines  might work;  it added\n\nthat  it  would depart  if it  could;  it set  forth several\n\ncircumstances that might make the case a special one; and it\n\ndescribed  as identical  (\"sex blind\"  and \"blind  to family\n\ncircumstances\")   guidelines   that,    in   fact,    differ\n\nsignificantly, the former involving a \"forbidden\" departure,\n\nand the latter a  \"discouraged\" departure.

On\n\nthe  one hand  lie  a host  of  quite special  circumstances\n\n(though  many  are of  the \"discouraged\"  sort), and  on the\n\nother  hand lies the simple  fact that Ms.  Mirna Rivera did\n\ntransport a  pound of cocaine  from New York  to Providence.\n\nThis is the  kind of case  in which, if  the district  court\n\ndeparts,  its informed views as  to why the  case is special\n\nwould seem  especially useful  and  would warrant  appellate\n\ncourt \"respect.\"  See pp. 23-24, supra.\n                                      \n\n          We remand the case for further proceedings.\n\n                             B\n\n                        Robert Adamo\n                                    \n\n          Mr.  Adamo  was  convicted  of   embezzling  about\n\n$100,000 belonging to  the union Health and  Welfare Fund of\n\nwhich he was a fiduciary,  in violation of 18 U.S.C.    664.\n\nHe accepted responsibility for  the crime, U.S.S.G.   3E1.1.\n\n                            -35-\n                             35\n\nIt was his first offense.  The Guidelines provided a minimum\n\nprison term  of  fifteen months.    See U.S.S.G.      2E5.2,\n                                       \n\n2B1.1,  3B1.3 (base offense level of 4; increase of 8 points\n\nfor  amount of  loss;  2  level  enhancement for  more  than\n\nminimal  planning;  2  level  enhancement   for  fiduciary);\n\nU.S.S.G.  Ch. 5,  Pt.  A (sentencing  table).   The district\n\ncourt, departing downward from the Guidelines, sentenced Mr.\n\nAdamo to probation alone, without any imprisonment. \n\n          The  court gave  the  following  reasons  for  its\n\ndownward departure:\n\n               When  I  look  at  these  cases  of\n          sentencing, the first thing I ask myself\n          is,  \"What sentence  would  I impose  if\n          there were no guidelines?\"   That's what\n          I did for more than 20 years.  And  then\n          I ask myself, \"What's a just sentence in\n          these circumstances?   Am I  going to be\n          limited  by these  artificial guidelines\n          made by people who  have no idea of what\n          kind  of a  case  I'm going  to have  to\n          decide?\"  No two cases are the same. . .\n          . \n\n               So  that's where justice is in this\n          case,  having  restitution made  to this\n          Health &amp;  Welfare Fund.  If  I send this\n          defendant   to   prison  I   think  it's\n          foreordained  that restitution  will not\n          be  made.    It  may  be  made  in  some\n          respect,  but  I'm  sure  the  defendant\n          would lose both his jobs and would  find\n          it  very  difficult  to have  employment\n          which   would   allow   him    to   make\n          restitution.  And a time in prison would\n          serve  no useful  purpose in  this case.\n          The  only  factor  in  sentencing  which\n\n                            -36-\n                             36\n\n          would be accomplished is punishment, but\n          the defendant has  been punished just by\n          being here -- just  being here and  what\n          he's gone through in the last  6 months,\n          and   the  notoriety   of  this.     So,\n          imprisonment serves no useful purpose in\n          this case.  It  certainly isn't a matter\n          of deterrence.   I'm sure  the defendant\n          will never do anything like this again.\n\n               Here is  a  man who  has  lived  an\n          exemplary life, he's worked two  jobs to\n          take care  of his family.   His wife has\n          worked, and although they were making in\n          the range of $70,000 a year, the problem\n          of educating two children came up.  It's\n          a problem  that everyone faces.  This is\n          where  the error  of judgment  comes in.\n          He took  this money,  not out  of greed,\n          not out of desire to own a fancy  car or\n          a  palatial  home  and a  boat,  but  to\n          educate his children.   He didn't  think\n          about  the  other  alternatives.     His\n          daughter  wanted to  go to  an expensive\n          private  school, instead  of going  to a\n          local state school of  some sort, and he\n          thought that's what she should have.  He\n          didn't consider loans and other types of\n          programs.  This  money was available, he\n          took  it  -- a  terrible  mistake.   But\n          that's the only mistake that he seems to\n          have made,  and  I just  don't think  he\n          should  spend time in  prison because of\n          this one mistake.\n\n               I  want  restitution  made, so  I'm\n          going  to exercise  my best  judgment in\n          these circumstances.   My best  judgment\n          is to  have as long a  term of probation\n          as possible so  that restitution can  be\n          made with the  guidance of the probation\n          office.\n\n               So,  I'm  going to  depart downward\n          and  impose  a  term of  probation  of 5\n          years.   That's the  maximum that  I can\n\n                            -37-\n                             37\n\n          impose.   And  one of the  conditions of\n          probation  will  be,  and is,  that  the\n          defendant shall pay  restitution in  the\n          amount  of  $91,125.62 to  the  Health &amp;\n          Welfare  Fund  of  the Building  Service\n          Employees  International Union,  AFL-CIO\n          Local 334.\n\n          The court's explication of its  reasons is useful,\n\nfor  it produces understanding  and permits evaluation, both\n\nby  appellate courts and by  the Commission.  We nonetheless\n\nbelieve the  analysis does  not permit the  departure before\n\nus.\n\n          First, we believe (deciding the question as a pure\n\nmatter of law,  see pp. 21-22, supra) that  the embezzlement\n                                    \n\nguidelines encompass, within their \"heartland,\" embezzlement\n\naccompanied by normal  restitution needs and  practicalities\n                     \n\n(i.e., the  simple facts  that restitution is  desirable and\n     \n\nthat a prison term will make restitution harder to achieve).\n\nIt  would  seem   obvious,  and  no  one  denies,  that  the\n\nembezzlement guidelines  are written  for ordinary  cases of\n\nembezzlement, that  restitution is  called for in  many such\n\ncases, and that prison terms often make restitution somewhat\n\nmore  difficult  to  achieve.    Moreover, the  embezzlement\n\nguideline  reflects  the  Commission's  intent  to  equalize\n\npunishments for \"white collar\" and \"blue collar\" crime.  See\n                                                            \n\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Supplementary Report on\n                                                            \n\n                            -38-\n                             38\n\nthe Initial Sentencing  Guidelines and Policy  Statements 18\n                                                         \n\n(1987); Hearings  Before the Senate Comm.  on the Judiciary,\n                                                           \n\n100th  Cong., 1st Sess. 54-55  (October 22, 1987).   Yet, as\n\nthe Sixth Circuit has pointed out, \n\n          a  rule  permitting greater  leniency in\n          sentencing  in  those  cases   in  which\n          restitution  is   at  issue  and   is  a\n                                          \n          meaningful possibility  (i.e., generally\n          white collar crimes) would . . . nurture\n          the  unfortunate  practice of  disparate\n          sentencing   based   on   socio-economic\n          status,   which   the  guidelines   were\n          intended to supplant.\n\nUnited States v.

We\n                                                     \n\nmention this fact because the  defendant has pointed to  one\n\nunusual  feature of the case.  The record before us contains\n\na  suggestion  that  Mr.  Adamo  could  keep  his  job  (and\n\ntherefore remain  able to make restitution)  were his prison\n\nterm only one year, but he  could not keep his job (and thus\n\nwould  lose  his  ability   to  make  restitution)  were  he\n\nsentenced  to the  Guidelines prison  term of  one year  and\n\nthree  months.   We  can imagine  an argument  for departure\n\nresting  upon a  strong need  for restitution,  an important\n\npractical advantage to the  lesser sentence, and a departure\n\nlimited to three months.  \n\n          We are not urging such a  departure or saying that\n\nwe  would eventually find it lawful.  We mention the special\n\ncircumstance to  underscore the need  for reasoned departure\n\nanalysis, sensitive to the way in which the Guidelines  seek\n\nto structure departure  decisions and to the  role that such\n\n                            -40-\n                             40\n\ndepartures, and their accompanying  reasons, can play in the\n\ncontinued development of the Sentencing Guidelines.  We have\n\nexplained why  the district court's analysis,  about how the\n\nfeatures  of a case make it unusual, can help both reviewing\n\ncourts  and the  Commission  itself.   See  pp. 4-5,  18-19,\n                                          \n\nsupra.  The district court, in Mr. Adamo's case, may wish to\n     \n\nconduct such an analysis in light of the special features of\n\nthe case to which the defendant has pointed.\n\n          We therefore remand this  case for new  sentencing\n\nproceedings.\n\n          The sentences  in both  cases are vacated  and the\n                                                            \n\ncases are remanded to the district court for resentencing.\n                                                          \n\n          So ordered. \n                     \n\n                            -41-\n                             41\n</pre>",
