This case involves claims for\n\npolitical discrimination and speech retaliation in violation of the\n\nFirst Amendment. Plaintiff Teresita Mercado-Berrios worked as a\n\ntransitory government employee in Puerto Rico.                 Toward the end of\n\nher   term   of    employment,    she    applied    for,   and   was    denied,   a\n\npermanent position.         She subsequently filed suit under the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that defendant María\n\nCancel-Alegría,      who    was   responsible      for   the   hiring   decision,\n\nviolated     the    First    Amendment     by    considering     her    political\n\naffiliation and protected speech activity in the hiring decision.\n\nAfter a six-day trial, the jury returned a verdict for Mercado-\n\nBerrios on both theories, awarding her $213,000 in compensatory\n\ndamages and $1,000,000 in punitive damages.\n\n             Cancel-Alegría now challenges both the imposition of\n\nliability and the amount of damages.               Considering the arguments\n\nthat Cancel-Alegría has made, and disregarding others that might\n\nhave been made but were not, we affirm the judgment as to the\n\nspeech retaliation claim and compensatory damages, reverse as to\n\nthe political discrimination claim, vacate the punitive damages\n\naward, and remand to the district court for a new trial on punitive\n\ndamages unless Mercado-Berrios consents to a reduction of her award\n\nfrom $1,000,000 to $500,000.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f                                     I.\n\n           We draw the facts from the trial record, reciting them in\n\nthe light most favorable to the verdict.             Marcano Rivera v. Turabo\n\nMedical Ctr. P'ship, 415 F.3d 162, 165 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           The basic factual outline is not in dispute.                  Plaintiff\n\nTeresita Mercado-Berrios' former employer, the Puerto Rico Tourism\n\nCompany (\"the Tourism Company\" or \"the Company\"), is a public\n\ncorporation of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.                  P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 23, § 671a.        Mercado-Berrios began work as a transitory\n\nemployee within the Company's Tourism Transportation Division on\n\nJune 9, 2003.    By contract, her term of employment was set to last\n\nfor six months.    Defendant María Cancel-Alegría was the Company's\n\nDirector of Tourism Transportation at the time.\n\n           The Tourism Transportation Division was a new addition to\n\nthe Tourism Company when Mercado-Berrios began work.               In 2002, the\n\nLegislative     Assembly     of   Puerto     Rico     assigned     the     Company\n\nresponsibility    for      \"[r]egulating,     investigating,        overseeing,\n\nintervening and imposing sanctions to those juridical persons or\n\nentities   engaged   in     rendering      tourist    ground     transportation\n\nservices in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"             P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n23, § 671e(12). The Tourism Transportation Division was created to\n\nperform those new duties. Cancel-Alegría began working in March of\n\n2003 as the only employee within the new division.             Because she had\n\nonly three months to bring the new division to full operational\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcapacity, she initially hired many employees on a transitory basis.\n\nShe explained that transitory appointments have \"a birth date and\n\nan ending\" and are exempt from the ordinary public notice and\n\ncompetitive entrance requirements for civil service positions.\n\n                 Mercado-Berrios was one such transitory employee.                       She\n\nleft       her   former    job   to   work        for    six   months    as   a     Tourism\n\nTransportation        Officer    within          the    Overseeing    Division      of   the\n\nTourism Transportation Division.1 She claims that she was promised\n\nthat she would be hired on a permanent basis at the end of her\n\ntransitory appointment. The Tourism Transportation Officers worked\n\nin the operational arm of the Tourism Transportation Division,\n\nwhich was known as the Overseeing Division.                        Their duty stations\n\nwere primarily at ports and airports.                      Mercado-Berrios worked at\n\nLuis       Muñoz    Marín     International             Airport,     where    her    basic\n\nresponsibilities were to inspect luxury vehicles and taxis for\n\ncompliance with Commonwealth safety regulations; to check those\n\nvehicles'        documentation;       to    orient       tourists     regarding     ground\n\ntransportation            services;        to     handle       transportation-related\n\ncomplaints; and to submit daily reports on the work she performed.\n\nSeveral layers of management separated Mercado-Berrios from Cancel-\n\nAlegía, and the two women had little contact with one another.\n\n\n\n       1\n          Mercado-Berrios ended up serving for seven months. In\nDecember of 2003, the Executive Director of the Tourism Company\nextended the transitory appointments for one month because\npermanent employees had not yet been hired.\n\n                                                -4-\n\fCancel-Alegría described the Overseeing Division as \"the most\n\ndelicate area\" under her supervision because of the constant\n\ninteraction between her employees and the tourists, drivers, and\n\nairport personnel.\n\n             By all accounts, Mercado-Berrios was a conscientious\n\nemployee who vigorously enforced the safety regulations within her\n\npurview.     Her supervisors' reviews were consistently glowing.              The\n\nluxury vehicle and taxi drivers received her efforts with less\n\nenthusiasm, however.      On several occasions, drivers became angry\n\nwith   Mercado-Berrios    for   performing        inspections    in   what   they\n\nperceived to be an overly aggressive manner.             The luxury vehicle\n\ndrivers, in particular, were not accustomed to close scrutiny, and\n\nthey pressured the Tourism Company to rein in Mercado-Berrios and\n\nthe other Tourism Transportation Officers.\n\n             In December of 2003, two supervisors instructed the\n\nTourism Transportation Officers to \"hold your horses\" and stop\n\nissuing citations to luxury vehicles that were not in compliance\n\nwith   the    safety   regulations.         The    officers     understood   the\n\ninstruction to have come from Cancel-Alegría.                   Mercado-Berrios\n\ncomplained to William Ríos-Vázquez, a shift supervisor, that she\n\nwas \"uncomfortable\" with the new policy because she thought it\n\nreflected \"a lack of respect\" for the work she and her co-workers\n\nwere performing, and because the lax enforcement would put \"the\n\ntourist, who is the person that is paying for service, his life was\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fat risk.\"    She made similar complaints to two other employees:\n\nCesar Ramos, a shift supervisor, and Julia Palacios, an attorney.\n\n            Around the same time, Mercado-Berrios and a number of her\n\ntransitory co-workers applied for permanent positions as Tourism\n\nTransportation    Officers.    There       was   testimony   that    all   the\n\ntransitory    employees   expected    to    be   appointed   to     permanent\n\npositions as long as their performance was satisfactory.             However,\n\non January 16, 2004, one day after the transitory appointments\n\nexpired, Mercado-Berrios was told that she would not be appointed\n\nto a permanent position and should turn in her identification to\n\nthe Human Resources Office.     Cancel-Alegría later testified that\n\nshe decided not to recommend Mercado-Berrios for a permanent\n\nposition because\n\n            there were so many complaints that had been\n            received in the way that she performed the\n            interventions, that we really couldn't afford\n            the luxury of -- well, the clientele that we\n            deal with in transportation, I always say that\n            it is like a minefield. Well, in this case\n            that would happen could certainly, as we\n            Puerto Ricans say, could set off the beehive.\n            So I didn't need personnel that would add more\n            of a situation -- I didn't need more personnel\n            to add more situations to the ones that they\n            already had.\n\n            The following year, Mercado-Berrios commenced an action\n\nin the District of Puerto Rico under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, naming\n\nCancel-Alegría and others as defendants.2         Mercado-Berrios alleged\n\n\n     2\n          The district court entered judgment as a matter of law\nfor the other defendants. That ruling is not challenged in the\n\n                                     -6-\n\fthat       Cancel-Alegría     chose      not    to     appoint    her    to   a    permanent\n\nposition because of her political views and in retaliation for\n\ncomplaining about the \"hold your horses\" instruction, all in\n\nviolation of the First Amendment.                    After a six-day trial, the jury\n\nreturned a verdict for Mercado-Berrios on both claims.                             The jury\n\nawarded Mercado-Berrios $113,000 for lost income and benefits,3\n\n$100,000       for    pain   and    suffering,         and   $1,000,000       in    punitive\n\ndamages.       The district court denied Cancel-Alegría's motions for\n\njudgment as a matter of law and her motion for a new trial and/or\n\nremittitur.          This appeal followed.\n\n                                               II.\n\n               We review the district court's denial of a motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law de novo.                    Mass. Eye and Ear Infirmary\n\nv. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc., 552 F.3d 47, 57 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\nA   Rule     50   motion     is    properly      granted        when    \"'the     facts   and\n\ninferences viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict point\n\nso strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the movant that a\n\nreasonable        jury   could     not   have        returned    the    verdict.'\"        Id.\n\n(quoting       Borges Colón v. Román-Abreu, 438 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2006)).\n\n\n\npresent appeal.\n       3\n          This portion of the award constitutes legal damages\nrather than an equitable award of backpay and frontpay.        See\nNegrón-Almeda v. Santiago, 528 F.3d 15, 26-27 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f            As framed in the district court's instructions and the\n\nverdict form, the question before the jury was whether Cancel-\n\nAlegría's decision not to hire Mercado-Berrios to a permanent\n\nposition was motivated by impermissible considerations.                The jury\n\nfound    that    two   such   considerations       entered   into   the    hiring\n\ndecision.       First,   it   found   that    Cancel-Alegría    discriminated\n\nagainst    Mercado-Berrios      based    on    Mercado-Berrios'     \"political\n\nbeliefs or ideas.\" Second, it found that Cancel-Alegría retaliated\n\nagainst     Mercado-Berrios     because       of   Mercado-Berrios'       \"speech\n\nactivity.\"\n\n            Each of these findings implicates a distinct line of\n\nFirst Amendment cases.        Under the first line of cases, government\n\nofficials are forbidden from taking adverse action against public\n\nemployees on the basis of political affiliation or belief, unless\n\npolitical loyalty is an appropriate requirement of the position in\n\nquestion.       See Welch v. Ciampa, 542 F.3d 927, 938-39 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).    The second line of cases \"call[s] for a different, though\n\nrelated, inquiry\" when a public employee's speech, rather than her\n\npolitical affiliation or belief, is at issue.            O'Hare Truck Serv.,\n\nInc. v. City of Northlake, 518 U.S. 712, 719 (1996).                  The basic\n\nrule in such cases is that government officials may not take\n\nadverse action against a public employee for speaking \"as a citizen\n\non a matter of public concern\" unless there is \"an adequate\n\njustification for treating the employee differently from any other\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fmember of the general public.\"                  Curran v. Cousins, 509 F.3d 36, 45\n\n(1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 418\n\n(2006)).\n\nA.    Political Discrimination\n\n                The essence of Mercado-Berrios' political discrimination\n\nclaim is that she was not hired for a permanent position because\n\nshe    was      an    insufficiently       zealous        supporter    of    the    Popular\n\nDemocratic Party (\"PDP\"), as evidenced by her refusal to buy or\n\nsell PDP event tickets and her failure to secure an endorsement\n\nfrom       a   PDP   politician.4         The    jury     agreed,     finding      that   her\n\n\"political beliefs or ideas were a substantial or motivating\n\nfactor\"        in    Cancel-Alegría's       hiring      decision.         Cancel-Alegría\n\nattacks that finding on appeal, arguing that the evidence does not\n\nsupport the jury's conclusion. Having carefully reviewed the trial\n\nrecord, we agree with Cancel-Alegría.\n\n                Several    former       employees    testified        that   the    Tourism\n\nTransportation Division was highly politicized, especially during\n\nthe    period        between    October    2003     and    the   general     election     in\n\nNovember        2004.          Nearly    every     employee      within      the    Tourism\n\nTransportation Division, including Mercado-Berrios and Cancel-\n\nAlegría, was affiliated with the PDP.                     According to William Ríos-\n\n\n       4\n          Neither party disputes that Cancel-Alegría's decision not\nto hire Mercado-Berrios to a permanent position constitutes an\nadverse employment action for purposes of the First Amendment\nclaims at issue here. See Morales-Tañon v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth.,\n524 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                            -9-\n\fVázquez, a shift supervisor, it was widely acknowledged that\n\n\"political backing\" from a PDP member of the Legislative Assembly\n\nwas   an   \"important\"    factor    in    Tourism    Transportation     Division\n\nappointments. Additional testimony revealed that certain employees\n\nwithin the Tourism Transportation Division pressured their co-\n\nworkers to participate in, or purchase tickets to, PDP events.\n\n            Although     there   was     no   evidence   that    Cancel-Alegría\n\npersonally pressured her employees, there was testimony that much\n\nof the political activity took place in close physical proximity to\n\nCancel-Alegría's office, that Cancel-Alegría spoke \"about political\n\nactivities and fund raising activities\" on at least one work-\n\nrelated occasion, and that some of the political activity within\n\nthe Tourism Transportation Division benefitted Cancel-Alegría's\n\nbrother, a local senator.        The jury could reasonably have inferred\n\nfrom this evidence that Cancel-Alegría was aware of, tacitly\n\napproved of, and perhaps even encouraged the partisan political\n\nactivity within her department.\n\n            Nevertheless, \"a politically charged atmosphere . . .,\n\nwithout more, provide[s] no basis for a reasonable inference that\n\ndefendant['s] employment decisions about plaintiff were tainted by\n\n[her] disregard of plaintiff's first amendment rights.\"                 LaRou v.\n\nRidlon,     98   F.3d     659,     661-62     (1st    Cir.      1996)   (quoting\n\nCorrea-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 58 (1st Cir.\n\n1990)).     Even when it is clear that the defendant has a political\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fagenda or harbors political biases, it remains the plaintiff's\n\nburden to produce evidence of a causal connection between those\n\nbiases and the challenged employment action.            Such evidence can be\n\ndirect or circumstantial, and it can come in a wide variety of\n\nforms.   Cf. Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 828 (1st Cir.\n\n1991) (noting in age discrimination and retaliation case that\n\nsources of circumstantial evidence of retaliation \"include, but are\n\nnot   limited    to,   evidence   of    differential     treatment    in   the\n\nworkplace,      statistical   evidence    showing   disparate     treatment,\n\ntemporal proximity of an employee's protected activity to an\n\nemployer's adverse action, and comments by the employer which\n\nintimate a retaliatory mindset\") (internal citations omitted).\n\nWhatever form the evidence takes, however, it must be sufficiently\n\nprobative to support a finding that the plaintiff's \"protected\n\nactivity or status was a 'substantial or motivating factor' in the\n\n[employment] decision, that is, that the protected activity or\n\nstatus was an impetus for, or moved the employer towards, the\n\n[employment] decision.\"       Costa-Urena v. Segarra, 590 F.3d 18, 25\n\n(1st Cir. 2009).\n\n           Mercado-Berrios failed to adduce sufficient evidence of\n\nthis sort.      Most importantly, there was no evidence that Cancel-\n\nAlegría was aware of Mercado-Berrios's refusal to buy and sell\n\nraffle tickets and to attend PDP events.            The two women rarely\n\nencountered      one   another,   and    they   never     had   any   private\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fconversations,    let    alone     politically-oriented        discussions   or\n\ninteractions. In addition, nothing suggests that Mercado-Berrios's\n\npolitical beliefs were so widely known that she would have been a\n\n\"conspicuous target[]\" for discriminatory action.              Acevedo-Díaz v.\n\nAponte, 1 F.3d 62, 69 (1st Cir. 1993).             In the absence of proof\n\nthat Cancel-Alegría knew of Mercado-Berrios's unwillingness to\n\nparticipate in PDP political activity, it is difficult to see how\n\nthat unwillingness could have been a substantial or motivating\n\nfactor in Cancel-Alegría's hiring decision.              See Carrasquillo v.\n\nPuerto Rico ex rel. Justice Dep't, 494 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(\"[I]f Jiménez did not know Carrasquillo's political views, they\n\ncould not have been a substantial factor motivating any adverse\n\nemployment action.\").\n\n          The    numerical    evidence      does   not      buttress   Mercado-\n\nBerrios's position.       Of the twenty-two transitory employees who\n\napplied for permanent positions, twelve were not hired.5                     Yet\n\nMercado-Berrios never attempted to show that those who were hired\n\nwere more politically active than those who were not hired.                  Cf.\n\nRodríguez-Ríos   v.     Cordero,    138   F.3d   22,   24    (1st   Cir.   1998)\n\n(plaintiff presented evidence that a reorganization resulted in\n\n\"seven PDP-member demotions, with no evidence that any NPP member\n\nwas either demoted or discharged\").         Although comparative evidence\n\n\n\n     5\n          In total, two hundred fifty people applied for twenty\npermanent positions.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fis not necessary, it can be helpful in a case like this where there\n\nis little else to suggest that the plaintiff was, or was likely to\n\nbe, targeted for her political views.\n\n          Mercado-Berrios contends that Cancel-Alegría's stated\n\nreason for not hiring her -- that she was too aggressive with the\n\ntaxi and limousine drivers -- was pretextual. There is no evidence\n\nof pretext, however.      By all accounts, Mercado-Berrios was not\n\nhired because her conscientious job performance upset the limousine\n\ndrivers, who were not accustomed to close scrutiny.                In this\n\nregard, she is partly a victim of her own success on the speech\n\nretaliation claim.     She presented strong evidence that Cancel-\n\nAlegría chose not to hire her because she enforced the safety\n\nregulations too vigorously and because she complained about the\n\nefforts to rein her in.    The strength of that evidence highlights\n\nthe absence of any evidence that her political orientation was an\n\nadditional factor motivating Cancel-Alegría's hiring decision.\n\n          The   most   favorable   testimony      from   Mercado-Berrios's\n\nperspective came from Eileen Ramos, the head of Human Resources at\n\nthe Tourism Company, who flatly stated that Cancel-Alegría took\n\npolitical considerations into account in her hiring decisions:\n\n          Q:      Now, there has been testimony here\n                  today that Ms. Cancel did not at any\n                  time take political considerations to\n                  make a recommendation for a position.\n                  What do you have to say about that?\n\n          COURT: In relation       to     a   career   position,\n                 correct?\n\n                                   -13-\n\f           Q:     In relation to the career positions at\n                  the Tourism Transportation Division for\n                  the tourism transportation officer\n                  position.\n\n           A:     I would say that's not true.\n\n           Q:     Why?\n\n           A:     Well, because the career positions that\n                  were posted for tourist transportation\n                  officer and other positions in that\n                  office, well, the human resources\n                  office didn't have any participation in\n                  the selection of those candidates.\n\n                  Well, in the hiring, meaning in the job\n                  announcement, et cetera, yes, we did\n                  have participation.       But in the\n                  selection process, that was done in the\n                  Division of Tourist Transportation\n                  office, in that department. They made\n                  a    panel,  interviewing    panel   to\n                  interview the people, but we didn't\n                  have    any   participation    in   the\n                  selection.\n\n           Although this evidence gives us pause, we conclude that\n\nit falls short of providing a sufficient evidentiary basis for a\n\njury finding in Mercado-Berrios's favor.     Ramos concluded that\n\npolitics must have been taken into account because the Human\n\nResources department had been improperly excluded from the hiring\n\nprocess.   But that impression was conclusory and speculative.   By\n\nher own admission, Ramos had no personal knowledge of the decision-\n\nmaking process.   Thus, her opinion is too thin a reed on which to\n\nrest the entire jury verdict.   Without more, we cannot say that it\n\nwas reasonable for the jury to conclude that Mercado-Berrios's\n\npolitical beliefs were a substantial or motivating factor in\n\n                                -14-\n\fCancel-Alegría's decision not to hire her.6        We therefore reverse\n\nthe   judgment   as   to   Mercado-Berrios's   political   discrimination\n\nclaim.\n\nB.    Retaliation for Speech\n\n            In addition to political discrimination, the jury found\n\nthat Cancel-Alegría refused to hire Mercado-Berrios because she had\n\nvocally resisted efforts to stop the safety inspections of luxury\n\nvehicles.    \"Official reprisal for protected speech offends the\n\nConstitution [because] it threatens to inhibit exercise of the\n\nprotected right, and the law is settled that as a general matter\n\nthe First Amendment prohibits government officials from subjecting\n\nan individual to retaliatory actions . . . for speaking out.\"\n\nHartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250, 256 (2006) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted).       The general rule holds true in the\n\npublic employment context: the government is largely forbidden from\n\ntaking adverse action against its employees in retaliation for\n\n\n\n      6\n          In resisting this conclusion, Mercado-Berrios relies\nheavily on Gutiérrez-Rodríguez v. Cartagena, a due process police\nbrutality case in which we discussed the standard of causation\nunder section 1983. See 882 F.2d 553, 561 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding\nthat police officers could be held liable for unconstitutional\nshooting because they \"directed and participated in the acts that\nled to the shooting\"). That case is not illuminating here. There\nis substantial evidence that Cancel-Alegría exercised direct\ncontrol over the hiring decisions for the Tourism Transportation\nDivision.   If there were proof that the decision not to hire\nMercado-Berrios to a permanent position was motivated by her\npolitical affiliation, Cancel-Alegría could be held liable for\nhaving directly \"subject[ed]\" Mercado-Berrios to a deprivation of\nconstitutional rights. 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n                                   -15-\n\ftheir protected speech.       See Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378,\n\n383-84 (1987).\n\n            However, in recognition of the government's interest in\n\nrunning   an   effective   workplace,    the   protection    that   public\n\nemployees   enjoy   against   speech-based     reprisals    is   qualified.\n\nRetaliatory employment actions do not violate the First Amendment\n\nif: (1) the speech in question was \"made pursuant to the employee's\n\nofficial duties,\" Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 413 (2006);\n\nor (2) the speech did not touch on a \"matter of public concern,\"\n\nConnick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 146 (1983); or (3) the interest of\n\nthe government as an employer in \"promoting the efficiency of the\n\npublic services it performs\" outweighs the interest of the employee\n\nin \"commenting upon matters of public concern,\" Pickering v. Board\n\nof Education, 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968).        Cancel-Alegría invokes on\n\nappeal the first of these exceptions, relating to speech made\n\npursuant to the employee's official duties.7\n\n            In Garcetti v. Ceballos, the Supreme Court held that \"the\n\nFirst Amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an\n\nemployee's expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities.\"\n\n\n\n     7\n          Cancel-Alegría makes several remarks in her brief that\ncould be taken as allusions to other exceptions. For example, she\nsays that any restriction on Mercado-Berrios' speech was justified\nbecause the Tourism Company's \"interest was to intervene with firm\nhands, but courteous and that the user be the priority.\" That may\nbe a reference to the Pickering balancing test. The argument is\nnot developed, however, and we therefore deem it waived.       See\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                  -16-\n\f547 U.S. at 424.       The relevant inquiry under Garcetti thus has two\n\nbasic     components    --    (1)   what     are    the      employee's    official\n\nresponsibilities? and (2) was the speech at issue made pursuant to\n\nthose responsibilities? -- both of which are highly context-\n\nsensitive.     See Foley v. Town of Randolph, 598 F.3d 1, 7, 9 (1st\n\nCir. 2010) (emphasizing that the context of the plaintiff's speech\n\nwas \"critical to [the] analysis\" and that the holding was \"limited\n\nto the particular facts of this case\").                Moreover, in identifying\n\nthe   employee's    job      responsibilities,         the    proper   inquiry   is\n\n\"practical\" rather than formal, focusing on \"the duties an employee\n\nactually is expected to perform.\"8              Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 424-25.\n\n            Cancel-Alegría focuses her argument on the daily incident\n\nreports in which Mercado-Berrios recorded her interventions with\n\ntaxis and luxury vehicles. She contends that those reports are not\n\nprotected by the First Amendment because Mercado-Berrios created\n\nand     submitted   them     pursuant      to    her    duties    as   a   Tourism\n\nTransportation Officer.        That is undoubtedly correct, as Mercado-\n\nBerrios herself acknowledged at trial.             But as Mercado-Berrios has\n\nrepeatedly made clear -- in her testimony, in her opening statement\n\n\n\n      8\n          As we recently emphasized, this does not mean that the\nemployer must have expressly required the employee to speak. See\nFoley, 598 F.3d at 6; see also Weintraub v. Bd. of Educ., 593 F.3d\n196, 203 (2d Cir. 2010).        Many employees enjoy significant\ndiscretion in determining what actions ought to be taken \"pursuant\nto\" their job responsibilities.     The voluntary or discretionary\naspect of their actions does not exempt them from employer control.\nSee Foley, 598 F.3d at 7.\n\n                                      -17-\n\fand closing argument at trial, in her opposition to the Rule 50(b)\n\nmotion, and in her brief on appeal -- the incident reports are not\n\nthe basis for her retaliation claim.             Rather, her claim is that\n\nCancel-Alegría retaliated against her for complaining about her\n\nsuperiors' interference with the performance of her job duties.\n\nThe   relevant   question   is    whether    those   complaints    were   made\n\npursuant to her official responsibilities.\n\n           That is not an easy question to answer.          On the one hand,\n\nMercado-Berrios's complaints were not made \"pursuant to\" her job\n\nduties in the most literal sense.                Her responsibilities as a\n\nTourism Transportation Officer were limited to inspecting vehicles,\n\nconducting safety interventions, reporting regulatory violations\n\nand interventions, and assisting passengers.            The record contains\n\nno hint that her superiors at the Tourism Company expected her to\n\nraise broad policy and safety concerns in carrying out her official\n\nduties.   Indeed, Cancel-Alegría expressed frustration at Mercado-\n\nBerrios' tendency to venture beyond her narrow responsibilities.\n\n           Garcetti   can    be    read     to    suggest   that   unofficial\n\ncommunications that are not \"part of what [the plaintiff] . . . was\n\nemployed to do,\" like Mercado-Berrios's complaints, fall outside\n\nthe scope of its rule.      547 U.S. at 421.         The Supreme Court was\n\ndeliberate in its choice of words.          It referred thirteen times to\n\nspeech made \"pursuant to\" an employee's job duties, most notably in\n\nits statements of the question presented and the holding.              Id. at\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f413, 421.    Elsewhere, it described the relevant class of speech in\n\nsimilar terms.9      The Court did not expressly indicate that it meant\n\nto sweep more broadly and include, for example, all speech that\n\nrelates     to,    contributes   to,    or    incidentally      facilitates     the\n\nperformance of official functions.\n\n             On the other hand, some of the considerations identified\n\nin Garcetti, such as the importance of \"affording government\n\nemployers sufficient discretion to manage their operations,\" id. at\n\n422, may suggest a wider scope.                 Several courts of appeals,\n\nfocusing on those cues, have construed the decision to cover all\n\nspeech made \"during the course of performing an official duty\" that\n\n\"reasonably        contributes   to     or     facilitates      the    employee's\n\nperformance of [an] official duty.\"            Brammer-Hoelter v. Twin Peaks\n\nCharter Acad., 492 F.3d 1192, 1203 (10th Cir. 2007); see also\n\nWilliams v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 480 F.3d 689, 693 (5th Cir.\n\n2007)    (per     curiam)   (\"Activities      undertaken   in    the   course   of\n\nperforming one's job are activities pursuant to official duties.\").\n\nOn   that    view,     complaints      like    Mercado-Berrios's       might     be\n\nunprotected, since they could be said to facilitate job performance\n\nby removing (or attempting to remove) an obstacle.                      The D.C.\n\n\n     9\n          For example, the Court referred to speech that \"owes its\nexistence to a public employee's professional responsibilities,\"\n547 U.S. at 421; speech that the employer \"has commissioned or\ncreated,\" id. at 422; speech that the employee \"was paid to\" make,\nid.; speech that the employee's \"duties . . . required him to\"\nmake, id.; speech that amounts to the employee's \"work product,\"\nid.; and speech that is an \"official communication[],\" id. at 423.\n\n                                       -19-\n\fCircuit has explicitly embraced such a view.          See Winder v. Erste,\n\n566 F.3d 209, 215 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (\"[W]e have consistently held\n\nthat a public employee speaks without First Amendment protection\n\nwhen        he    reports   conduct    that   interferes   with   his   job\n\nresponsibilities, even if the report is made outside his chain of\n\ncommand.\").\n\n                 In short, there are strong arguments that the \"pursuant\n\nto official duties\" doctrine of Garcetti does not apply to Mercado-\n\nBerrios's complaints to her superiors, but there are also strong\n\narguments to the contrary.            Cancel-Alegría has addressed none of\n\nthis complexity, focusing only on the daily incident reports filed\n\nby Mercado-Berrios despite ample notice of the basis for Mercado-\n\nBerrios's speech retaliation claim.            Even after Mercado-Berrios\n\nagain clarified her position in her brief to this court, Cancel-\n\nAlegría declined to file a reply brief.           We will not do a party's\n\nwork for her.          Consequently, we will not address arguments on\n\nappeal that Cancel-Alegría might have made, but did not make, about\n\nthe application of Garcetti to Mercado-Berrios's complaints.10          See\n\nRivera-Gomez v. de Castro, 843 F.2d 631, 635 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"[A]\n\nlitigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and\n\ndistinctly or else forever hold its peace.\") (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).              Because Cancel-Alegría has not\n\n\n       10\n          We also will not address Cancel-Alegría's qualified\nimmunity argument, which simply refers back to her misguided merits\nargument.\n\n                                       -20-\n\fcontested the sufficiency of the evidence, or made any other\n\nargument attacking the speech retaliation claim, the judgment is\n\naffirmed as to that claim.\n\n                                III.\n\n          Cancel-Alegría's final argument is that the damages award\n\nis excessive and should have been reduced by the district court.11\n\n\"[T]he measure of damages in section 1983 actions is a matter of\n\nfederal common law.\"   Figueroa-Rodriguez v. Aquino, 863 F.2d 1037,\n\n1045 (1st Cir. 1988) (citing Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 257-59\n\n(1978), and Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U.S. 229,\n\n238-40 (1969)).   Although punitive damages awards are subject to\n\nconstitutional limits as well, see, e.g., State Farm Mut. Auto.\n\nIns. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408 (2003), Cancel-Alegría has not\n\nargued that the award in this case exceeds those limits.        We\n\ntherefore limit our review to whether the award is excessive as a\n\nmatter of federal common law. See Hardeman v. City of Albuquerque,\n\n377 F.3d 1106, 1122 (10th Cir. 2004) (applying common law standard\n\nbecause constitutional argument had been forfeited).     Under the\n\ntraditional common law standard, a district court will not disturb\n\nthe jury's compensatory or punitive damages award unless the award\n\nis \"'grossly excessive,' 'inordinate,' 'shocking to the conscience\n\n\n\n     11\n          She also argues that the district court should have\ngranted a new trial because the verdict was against the weight of\nthe evidence. The district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying that request.\n\n                                -21-\n\fof the court,' or 'so high that it would be a denial of justice to\n\npermit it to stand.'\"12       Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 215, 216\n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (quoting Segal v. Gilbert Color Sys., Inc., 746\n\nF.2d 78, 80-81 (1st Cir. 1984)); see also 1 Sheldon H. Nahmod,\n\nCivil Rights & Civil Liberties Litigation §§ 4:12, 4:45 (4th ed.\n\n2009).     We,   in   turn,   review    the   district   court's    denial   of\n\nremittitur for abuse of discretion.              See McDonough v. City of\n\nQuincy, 452 F.3d 8, 22 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Gasperini v. Ctr.\n\nfor Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415, 433 (1996)).\n\nA.   Compensatory Damages\n\n            The jury awarded Mercado-Berrios $113,000 for \"loss of\n\nearnings, salaries, and benefits\" and $100,000 for \"emotional pain\n\nand suffering.\"       With respect to the lost earnings, the following\n\nfacts were either stipulated to or supported by the evidence at\n\ntrial:    Mercado-Berrios     earned    $2,400   per   month   as   a   Tourism\n\nTransportation Officer; she left the Tourism Company in January of\n\n2004; she earned approximately $900 per month in a secretarial\n\nposition from March of 2004 until October of 2004; she earned less\n\nthan $10,000 in 2005; she earned no income in 2006; and she paid\n\napproximately $1,000 per year in medical expenses that would\n\n\n\n     12\n          Because Cancel-Alegría has not raised the issue, we do\nnot consider what effect, if any, the Supreme Court's decision in\nExxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 128 S. Ct. 2605 (2008), has had on our\nsection 1983 damages jurisprudence. Cf. Mendez v. County of San\nBernardino, 540 F.3d 1109, 1122 (9th Cir. 2008); Kunz v. DeFelice,\n538 F.3d 667, 678 (7th Cir. 2008).\n\n                                       -22-\n\fotherwise have been covered by her government benefits plan.                              She\n\nalso testified that, as of the trial date in 2007, she remained\n\nunable to find steady work.              On those facts alone, Mercado-Berrios\n\nlost approximately $71,000 in income and benefits in the three\n\nyears after her departure from the Tourism Company.\n\n                 Cancel-Alegría presented no evidence to suggest that\n\nthese figures are inflated or that Mercado-Berrios unreasonably\n\nfailed      to    mitigate    her       damages.             Even   factoring     in    taxes,\n\naccounting for the likelihood that Mercado-Berrios would eventually\n\nfind steady employment, and discounting the estimated stream of\n\nfuture income to its present value, cf. Jones & Laughlin Steel\n\nCorp. v. Pfeifer, 462 U.S. 523 (1983), we conclude that the jury's\n\naward for lost earnings was reasonable.                        See Segal, 746 F.2d at 81\n\n(\"Even in cases . . . which involve only economic loss, review must\n\nproceed with great deference for the jury's assessment: 'the jury\n\nis free to select the highest figures for which there is adequate\n\nevidentiary support.'\" (quoting Kolb v. Goldring, Inc., 694 F.2d\n\n869, 872 (1st Cir. 1982))).\n\n                 The award for pain and suffering is likewise reasonable.\n\nWe   have    recognized       that       \"converting           feelings    such    as    pain,\n\nsuffering, and mental anguish into dollars is not an exact science.\n\nThe jury is free 'to harmonize the verdict at the highest or lowest\n\npoints   for       which   there    is       a    sound      evidentiary    predicate,     or\n\nanywhere     in     between   .     .    .       so   long    as    the   end   result    does\n\n\n                                                 -23-\n\fnot . . . strike such a dissonant chord that justice would be\n\ndenied were the judgment permitted to stand.'\" Correa v.

Mercado-\n\nBerrios testified at length about the mental and emotional distress\n\nshe suffered as a consequence of her departure from the Tourism\n\nCompany.    For example, she told the jury that she suffered from so\n\nmuch stress that she was unable to sleep, that her relationships\n\nwith friends and extended family suffered, and that she eventually\n\nhad to seek the help of a psychologist.            In light of the evidence,\n\nwe do not find the jury's award \"to cross the outer limit of the\n\nwide universe of acceptable awards.\"            Id.\n\nB.   Punitive Damages\n\n            Because Cancel-Alegría did not challenge the availability\n\nof   punitive   damages    below,     our     review   of   the   award    is   for\n\nexcessiveness only.       Also, as noted earlier, we will conduct our\n\nreview under the traditional common law excessiveness standard\n\nrather than the Due Process excessiveness standard.                The standard\n\nis the same as for compensatory damages: the award should not be\n\ndisturbed    unless   it       is   \"'grossly    excessive,'      'inordinate,'\n\n'shocking to the conscience of the court,' or 'so high that it\n\nwould be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.'\"                Wagenmann,\n\n829 F.2d at 215, 216; Hardeman, 377 F.3d at 1122.             \"[T]he amount of\n\nsuch   an   award   is,   in    the   first    instance,    committed      to   the\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fdiscretion of the nisi prius court,\" Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 216,\n\nand we review the district court's excessiveness determination for\n\nabuse of discretion only.     See Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Leatherman\n\nTool Group, Inc., 532 U.S. 424, 433 (2001) (\"If no constitutional\n\nissue is raised, the role of the appellate court, at least in the\n\nfederal system, is merely to review the trial court's determination\n\nunder an abuse-of-discretion standard.\") (internal quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted).\n\n          The   $1,000,000   award   was   likely   intended    to   punish\n\nCancel-Alegría both for considering Mercado-Berrios's political\n\naffiliation and for considering Mercado-Berrios's protected speech\n\nin the refusal to hire her for a permanent position.           The alleged\n\npolitical discrimination cannot form the basis for a punitive\n\ndamages award, however, because it was unsupported by the evidence.\n\nThe question is thus whether an award of $1,000,000 for speech\n\nretaliation is excessive under the circumstances of this case.           We\n\nconclude that it is.\n\n          The conduct in question was undoubtedly reprehensible.\n\nMercado-Berrios testified at trial that there were \"taxi drivers\n\nand chauffeurs who [were] not complying with the rules and the\n\ntraffic laws, putting at risk the lives of human beings.\"                In\n\nlashing out at an employee for bringing those safety concerns to\n\nlight, Cancel-Alegría chilled the free flow of information relating\n\nto passenger safety and thereby increased the risk that innocent\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fpassengers would be harmed. Cf. Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549\n\nU.S. 346, 355 (2007) (noting that risk of harm to the public may be\n\ntaken into account in measuring reprehensibility).\n\n              At the same time, the retaliation against Mercado-Berrios\n\nappears to have been an isolated incident.            No other speech-based\n\nemployment actions were taken against Mercado-Berrios, and there is\n\nno evidence that Cancel-Alegría acted similarly against other\n\nemployees.      It is also clear that the award in this case is large\n\nfor a First Amendment claim in the public employment context. Cf.,\n\ne.g., Rodríguez-Marín v. Rivera-González, 438 F.3d 72, 84 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) ($195,000 in punitive damages); Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz Velez,\n\n341 F.3d 86, 102 (1st Cir. 2003) ($250,000 in punitive damages).\n\n              Unfortunately, few recent cases provide direct guidance\n\non this issue.      Courts rarely apply the common law excessiveness\n\nstandard to punitive damages awards these days, since aggrieved\n\ndefendants now commonly invoke the arguably stricter due process\n\nstandard.      The Tenth Circuit's decision in Hardeman v. City of\n\nAlbuquerque is perhaps most on point.          The jury in that case found\n\nthat    the   defendant    mayor   denied    the   plaintiff    a   contractual\n\nseverance     package     worth   approximately    $40,000     because   of   the\n\nplaintiff's association with African-American groups.               377 F.3d at\n\n1112.     The jury awarded $1,000,000 in punitive damages on the\n\nclaim, which the district judge reduced to $625,000.                  Id.     The\n\n\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fTenth Circuit affirmed under the common law standard. Id. at 1122-23.\n\n            We think a similar approach is appropriate here.      An\n\naward of $1,000,000 against an individual-capacity defendant based\n\non the conduct proved at trial is \"grossly excessive\" and \"shocking\n\nto the conscience of the court.\"    Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 215.   In\n\nour judgment, $500,000 is the maximum award that can be justified\n\non the facts of this case.       We therefore vacate the award and\n\nremand to the district court for a new trial on punitive damages\n\nunless Mercado-Berrios consents to a reduction of her award from\n\n$1,000,000 to $500,000.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED as to\n\nthe speech retaliation claim and compensatory damages, REVERSED as\n\nto the political discrimination claim, and VACATED as to punitive\n\ndamages.    The case is REMANDED to the district court for a new\n\ntrial on punitive damages unless Mercado-Berrios consents in the\n\ndistrict court to a reduction of her award from $1,000,000 to\n\n$500,000.    Each party shall be responsible for its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\f",

Peñagarícano-Brown, Assistant Solicitor General, with whom Irene S. Soroeta-Kodesh, Solicitor General, Leticia Casalduc-Rabell, Deputy Solicitor General, and Zaira Z. Girón-Anadón, Deputy Solicitor General, were on brief, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Before LIPEZ, BALDOCK,<sup>[*]</sup> and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This case involves claims for political discrimination and speech retaliation in violation of the First Amendment. Plaintiff Teresita Mercado-Berrios worked as a transitory government employee in Puerto Rico. Toward the end of her term of employment, she applied for, and was denied, a permanent position. She subsequently filed suit under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that defendant María Cancel-Alegría, who was responsible for the hiring decision, violated the First Amendment by considering her political affiliation and protected speech activity in the hiring decision. After a six-day trial, the jury returned a verdict for Mercado-Berrios on both theories, awarding her $213,000 in compensatory damages and $1,000,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p>Cancel-Alegría now challenges both the imposition of liability and the amount of damages. Considering the arguments that Cancel-Alegría has made, and disregarding others that might have been made but were not, we affirm the judgment as to the speech retaliation claim and compensatory damages, reverse as to the political discrimination claim, vacate the punitive damages award, and remand to the district court for a new trial on punitive damages unless Mercado-Berrios consents to a reduction of her award from $1,000,000 to $500,000.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We draw the facts from the trial record, reciting them in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>Marcano Rivera v. Turabo Medical Ctr. P'ship,</i> 415 F.3d 162, 165 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>The basic factual outline is not in dispute. Plaintiff Teresita Mercado-Berrios' former employer, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company (\"the Tourism Company\" or \"the Company\"), is a public corporation of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23, § 671a. Mercado-Berrios began work as a transitory employee within the Company's Tourism Transportation Division on June 9, 2003. By contract, her term of employment was set to last for six months. Defendant María Cancel-Alegría was the Company's Director of Tourism Transportation at the time.</p>\n<p>The Tourism Transportation Division was a new addition to the Tourism Company when Mercado-Berrios began work. In 2002, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico assigned the Company responsibility for \"[r]egulating, investigating, overseeing, intervening and imposing sanctions to those juridical persons or entities engaged in rendering tourist ground transportation services in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23, § 671e(12). The Tourism Transportation Division was created to perform those new duties. Cancel-Alegría began working in March of 2003 as the only employee within the new <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> division. Because she had only three months to bring the new division to full operational capacity, she initially hired many employees on a transitory basis. She explained that transitory appointments have \"a birth date and an ending\" and are exempt from the ordinary public notice and competitive entrance requirements for civil service positions.</p>\n<p>Mercado-Berrios was one such transitory employee. She left her former job to work for six months as a Tourism Transportation Officer within the Overseeing Division of the Tourism Transportation Division.<sup>[1]</sup> She claims that she was promised that she would be hired on a permanent basis at the end of her transitory appointment. The Tourism Transportation Officers worked in the operational arm of the Tourism Transportation Division, which was known as the Overseeing Division. Their duty stations were primarily at ports and airports. Mercado-Berrios worked at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, where her basic responsibilities were to inspect luxury vehicles and taxis for compliance with Commonwealth safety regulations; to check those vehicles' documentation; to orient tourists regarding ground transportation services; to handle transportation-related complaints; and to submit daily reports on the work she performed. Several layers of management separated Mercado-Berrios from Cancel-Alegía, and the two women had little contact with one another. Cancel-Alegría described the Overseeing Division as \"the most delicate area\" under her supervision because of the constant interaction between her employees and the tourists, drivers, and airport personnel.</p>\n<p>By all accounts, Mercado-Berrios was a conscientious employee who vigorously enforced the safety regulations within her purview. Her supervisors' reviews were consistently glowing. The luxury vehicle and taxi drivers received her efforts with less enthusiasm, however. On several occasions, drivers became angry with Mercado-Berrios for performing inspections in what they perceived to be an overly aggressive manner. The luxury vehicle drivers, in particular, were not accustomed to close scrutiny, and they pressured the Tourism Company to rein in Mercado-Berrios and the other Tourism Transportation Officers.</p>\n<p>In December of 2003, two supervisors instructed the Tourism Transportation Officers to \"hold your horses\" and stop issuing citations to luxury vehicles that were not in compliance with the safety regulations. The officers understood the instruction to have come from Cancel-Alegría. Mercado-Berrios complained to William Ríos-Vázquez, a shift supervisor, that she was \"uncomfortable\" with the new policy because she thought it reflected \"a lack of respect\" for the work she and her co-workers were performing, and because the lax enforcement would put \"the tourist, who is the person that is paying for service, his life was at risk.\" She made similar complaints to two other employees: Cesar Ramos, a shift supervisor, and Julia Palacios, an attorney.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, Mercado-Berrios and a number of her transitory co-workers applied for permanent positions as Tourism Transportation Officers. There was testimony that all the transitory employees expected to be appointed to permanent positions as long as their performance was satisfactory. However, on January 16, 2004, one day after the transitory appointments expired, Mercado-Berrios was told <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> that she would not be appointed to a permanent position and should turn in her identification to the Human Resources Office. Cancel-Alegría later testified that she decided not to recommend Mercado-Berrios for a permanent position because</p>\n<blockquote>there were so many complaints that had been received in the way that she performed the interventions, that we really couldn't afford the luxury ofwell, the clientele that we deal with in transportation, I always say that it is like a minefield. Well, in this case that would happen could certainly, as we Puerto Ricans say, could set off the beehive. So I didn't need personnel that would add more of a situationI didn't need more personnel to add more situations to the ones that they already had.</blockquote>\n<p>The following year, Mercado-Berrios commenced an action in the District of Puerto Rico under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, naming Cancel-Alegría and others as defendants.<sup>[2]</sup> Mercado-Berrios alleged that Cancel-Alegría chose not to appoint her to a permanent position because of her political views and in retaliation for complaining about the \"hold your horses\" instruction, all in violation of the First Amendment. After a six-day trial, the jury returned a verdict for Mercado-Berrios on both claims. The jury awarded Mercado-Berrios $113,000 for lost income and benefits,<sup>[3]</sup> $100,000 for pain and suffering, and $1,000,000 in punitive damages. The district court denied Cancel-Alegría's motions for judgment as a matter of law and her motion for a new trial and/or remittitur. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo. <i>Mass. Eye and Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc.,</i> 552 F.3d 47, 57 (1st Cir.2009). A Rule 50 motion is properly granted when \"`the facts and inferences viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the movant that a reasonable jury could not have returned the verdict.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Borges Colón v. Román-Abreu,</i> 438 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p>As framed in the district court's instructions and the verdict form, the question before the jury was whether Cancel-Alegría's decision not to hire Mercado-Berrios to a permanent position was motivated by impermissible considerations. The jury found that two such considerations entered into the hiring decision. First, it found that Cancel-Alegría discriminated against Mercado-Berrios based on Mercado-Berrios' \"political beliefs or ideas.\" Second, it found that Cancel-Alegría retaliated against Mercado-Berrios because of Mercado-Berrios' \"speech activity.\"</p>\n<p>Each of these findings implicates a distinct line of First Amendment cases. Under the first line of cases, government officials are forbidden from taking adverse action against public employees on the basis of political affiliation or belief, unless political loyalty is an appropriate requirement of the position in question. <i>See </i><i>Welch v. Ciampa,</i> 542 F.3d 927, 938-39 (1st Cir.2008). The second line of cases \"call[s] for a different, though related, inquiry\" when a public employee's speech, rather than her political affiliation or belief, is at issue. <i>O'Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v. City of Northlake,</i> 518 U.S. 712, 719, 116 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> S.Ct. 2353, 135 L.Ed.2d 874 (1996). The basic rule in such cases is that government officials may not take adverse action against a public employee for speaking \"as a citizen on a matter of public concern\" unless there is \"an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.\" <i>Curran v. Cousins,</i> 509 F.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> 547 U.S. 410, 418, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Political Discrimination</h2>\n<p>The essence of Mercado-Berrios' political discrimination claim is that she was not hired for a permanent position because she was an insufficiently zealous supporter of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"), as evidenced by her refusal to buy or sell PDP event tickets and her failure to secure an endorsement from a PDP politician.<sup>[4]</sup> The jury agreed, finding that her \"political beliefs or ideas were a substantial or motivating factor\" in Cancel-Alegría's hiring decision. Cancel-Alegría attacks that finding on appeal, arguing that the evidence does not support the jury's conclusion. Having carefully reviewed the trial record, we agree with Cancel-Alegría.</p>\n<p>Several former employees testified that the Tourism Transportation Division was highly politicized, especially during the period between October 2003 and the general election in November 2004. Nearly every employee within the Tourism Transportation Division, including Mercado-Berrios and Cancel-Alegría, was affiliated with the PDP. According to William Ríos-Vázquez, a shift supervisor, it was widely acknowledged that \"political backing\" from a PDP member of the Legislative Assembly was an \"important\" factor in Tourism Transportation Division appointments. Additional testimony revealed that certain employees within the Tourism Transportation Division pressured their co-workers to participate in, or purchase tickets to, PDP events.</p>\n<p>Although there was no evidence that Cancel-Alegría personally pressured her employees, there was testimony that much of the political activity took place in close physical proximity to Cancel-Alegría's office, that Cancel-Alegría spoke \"about political activities and fund raising activities\" on at least one work-related occasion, and that some of the political activity within the Tourism Transportation Division benefitted Cancel-Alegría's brother, a local senator. The jury could reasonably have inferred from this evidence that Cancel-Alegría was aware of, tacitly approved of, and perhaps even encouraged the partisan political activity within her department.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, \"a politically charged atmosphere ..., without more, provide[s] no basis for a reasonable inference that defendant['s] employment decisions about <i>plaintiff</i> were tainted by [her] disregard of <i>plaintiff's</i> first amendment rights.\" <i>LaRou v. Ridlon,</i> 98 F.3d 659, 661-62 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez,</i> 903 F.2d 49, 58 (1st Cir. 1990)). Even when it is clear that the defendant has a political agenda or harbors political biases, it remains the plaintiff's burden to produce evidence of a causal connection between those biases and the challenged employment action. Such evidence can be direct or circumstantial, and it can come in a wide variety of forms. <i>Cf. </i><i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 828 (1st Cir.1991) (noting in age discrimination <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> and retaliation case that sources of circumstantial evidence of retaliation \"include, but are not limited to, evidence of differential treatment in the workplace, statistical evidence showing disparate treatment, temporal proximity of an employee's protected activity to an employer's adverse action, and comments by the employer which intimate a retaliatory mindset\") (internal citations omitted). Whatever form the evidence takes, however, it must be sufficiently probative to support a finding that the plaintiff's \"protected activity or status was a `substantial or motivating factor' in the [employment] decision, that is, that the protected activity or status was an impetus for, or moved the employer towards, the [employment] decision.\" <i>Costa-Urena v. Segarra,</i> 590 F.3d 18, 25 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Mercado-Berrios failed to adduce sufficient evidence of this sort. Most importantly, there was no evidence that Cancel-Alegría was aware of Mercado-Berrios's refusal to buy and sell raffle tickets and to attend PDP events. The two women rarely encountered one another, and they never had any private conversations, let alone politically-oriented discussions or interactions. In addition, nothing suggests that Mercado-Berrios's political beliefs were so widely known that she would have been a \"conspicuous target[ ]\" for discriminatory action. <i>Acevedo-Díaz v. Aponte,</i> 1 F.3d 62, 69 (1st Cir.1993). In the absence of proof that Cancel-Alegría knew of Mercado-Berrios's unwillingness to participate in PDP political activity, it is difficult to see how that unwillingness could have been a substantial or motivating factor in Cancel-Alegría's hiring decision. <i>See </i><i>Carrasquillo v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Justice Dep't,</i> 494 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2007) (\"[I]f Jiménez did not know Carrasquillo's political views, they could not have been a substantial factor motivating any adverse employment action.\").</p>\n<p>The numerical evidence does not buttress Mercado-Berrios's position. Of the twenty-two transitory employees who applied for permanent positions, twelve were not hired.<sup>[5]</sup> Yet Mercado-Berrios never attempted to show that those who were hired were more politically active than those who were not hired. <i>Cf. </i><i>Rodríguez-Ríos v. Cordero,</i> 138 F.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir. 1998) (plaintiff presented evidence that a reorganization resulted in \"seven PDP-member demotions, with no evidence that any NPP member was either demoted or discharged\"). Although comparative evidence is not necessary, it can be helpful in a case like this where there is little else to suggest that the plaintiff was, or was likely to be, targeted for her political views.</p>\n<p>Mercado-Berrios contends that Cancel-Alegría's stated reason for not hiring herthat she was too aggressive with the taxi and limousine driverswas pretextual. There is no evidence of pretext, however. By all accounts, Mercado-Berrios was not hired because her conscientious job performance upset the limousine drivers, who were not accustomed to close scrutiny. In this regard, she is partly a victim of her own success on the speech retaliation claim. She presented strong evidence that Cancel-Alegría chose not to hire her because she enforced the safety regulations too vigorously and because she complained about the efforts to rein her in. The strength of that evidence highlights the absence of any evidence that her political orientation was an additional factor motivating Cancel-Alegría's hiring decision.</p>\n<p>The most favorable testimony from Mercado-Berrios's perspective came from Eileen Ramos, the head of Human Resources <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> at the Tourism Company, who flatly stated that Cancel-Alegría took political considerations into account in her hiring decisions:</p>\n<blockquote>Q: Now, there has been testimony here today that Ms. Cancel did not at any time take political considerations to make a recommendation for a position. What do you have to say about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>COURT: In relation to a career position, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: In relation to the career positions at the Tourism Transportation Division for the tourism transportation officer position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: I would say that's not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Well, because the career positions that were posted for tourist transportation officer and other positions in that office, well, the human resources office didn't have any participation in the selection of those candidates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Well, in the hiring, meaning in the job announcement, et cetera, yes, we did have participation. But in the selection process, that was done in the Division of Tourist Transportation office, in that department. They made a panel, interviewing panel to interview the people, but we didn't have any participation in the selection.</blockquote>\n<p>Although this evidence gives us pause, we conclude that it falls short of providing a sufficient evidentiary basis for a jury finding in Mercado-Berrios's favor. Ramos concluded that politics must have been taken into account because the Human Resources department had been improperly excluded from the hiring process. But that impression was conclusory and speculative. By her own admission, Ramos had no personal knowledge of the decision-making process. Thus, her opinion is too thin a reed on which to rest the entire jury verdict. Without more, we cannot say that it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that Mercado-Berrios's political beliefs were a substantial or motivating factor in Cancel-Alegría's decision not to hire her.<sup>[6]</sup> We therefore reverse the judgment as to Mercado-Berrios's political discrimination claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Retaliation for Speech</h2>\n<p>In addition to political discrimination, the jury found that Cancel-Alegría refused to hire Mercado-Berrios because she had vocally resisted efforts to stop the safety inspections of luxury vehicles. \"Official reprisal for protected speech offends the Constitution [because] it threatens to inhibit exercise of the protected right, and the law is settled that as a general matter the First Amendment prohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions ... for speaking out.\" <i>Hartman v. Moore,</i> 547 U.S. 250, 256, 126 S.Ct. 1695, 164 L.Ed.2d 441 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The general rule holds true in the public employment context: the government is largely forbidden from taking adverse action against its employees in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> retaliation for their protected speech. <i>See </i><i>Rankin v. McPherson,</i> 483 U.S. 378, 383-84, 107 S.Ct. 2891, 97 L.Ed.2d 315 (1987).</p>\n<p>However, in recognition of the government's interest in running an effective workplace, the protection that public employees enjoy against speech-based reprisals is qualified. Retaliatory employment actions do not violate the First Amendment if: (1)the speech in question was \"made pursuant to the employee's official duties,\" <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> 547 U.S. 410, 413, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006); or (2)the speech did not touch on a \"matter of public concern,\" <i>Connick v. Myers,</i> 461 U.S. 138, 146, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983); or (3)the interest of the government as an employer in \"promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs\" outweighs the interest of the employee in \"commenting upon matters of public concern,\" <i>Pickering v. Board of Education,</i> 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). Cancel-Alegría invokes on appeal the first of these exceptions, relating to speech made pursuant to the employee's official duties.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos</i><i>,</i> the Supreme Court held that \"the First Amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an employee's expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities.\" 547 U.S. at 424, 126 S.Ct. 1951. The relevant inquiry under <i>Garcetti</i> thus has two basic components(1) what are the employee's official responsibilities? and (2) was the speech at issue made pursuant to those responsibilities?both of which are highly context-sensitive. <i>See </i><i>Foley v. Town of Randolph,</i> 598 F.3d 1, 7, 9 (1st Cir.2010) (emphasizing that the context of the plaintiff's speech was \"critical to [the] analysis\" and that the holding was \"limited to the particular facts of this case\"). Moreover, in identifying the employee's job responsibilities, the proper inquiry is \"practical\" rather than formal, focusing on \"the duties an employee actually is expected to perform.\"<sup>[8]</sup><i>Garcetti,</i> 547 U.S. at 424-25, 126 S.Ct. 1951.</p>\n<p>Cancel-Alegría focuses her argument on the daily incident reports in which Mercado-Berrios recorded her interventions with taxis and luxury vehicles. She contends that those reports are not protected by the First Amendment because Mercado-Berrios created and submitted them pursuant to her duties as a Tourism Transportation Officer. That is undoubtedly correct, as Mercado-Berrios herself acknowledged at trial. But as Mercado-Berrios has repeatedly made clearin her testimony, in her opening statement and closing argument at trial, in her opposition to the Rule 50(b) motion, and in her brief on appealthe incident reports are not the basis for her retaliation claim. Rather, her claim is that Cancel-Alegría retaliated against her for <i>complaining</i> about her superiors' interference with the performance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> of her job duties. The relevant question is whether those complaints were made pursuant to her official responsibilities.</p>\n<p>That is not an easy question to answer. On the one hand, Mercado-Berrios's complaints were not made \"pursuant to\" her job duties in the most literal sense. Her responsibilities as a Tourism Transportation Officer were limited to inspecting vehicles, conducting safety interventions, reporting regulatory violations and interventions, and assisting passengers. The record contains no hint that her superiors at the Tourism Company expected her to raise broad policy and safety concerns in carrying out her official duties. Indeed, Cancel-Alegría expressed frustration at Mercado-Berrios' tendency to venture beyond her narrow responsibilities.</p>\n<p><i>Garcetti</i> can be read to suggest that unofficial communications that are not \"part of what [the plaintiff] ... was employed to do,\" like Mercado-Berrios's complaints, fall outside the scope of its rule. 547 U.S. at 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951. The Supreme Court was deliberate in its choice of words. It referred thirteen times to speech made \"pursuant to\" an employee's job duties, most notably in its statements of the question presented and the holding. <i>Id.</i> at 413, 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951. Elsewhere, it described the relevant class of speech in similar terms.<sup>[9]</sup> The Court did not expressly indicate that it meant to sweep more broadly and include, for example, all speech that relates to, contributes to, or incidentally facilitates the performance of official functions.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, some of the considerations identified in <i>Garcetti,</i> such as the importance of \"affording government employers sufficient discretion to manage their operations,\" <i>id.</i> at 422, may suggest a wider scope. Several courts of appeals, focusing on those cues, have construed the decision to cover all speech made \"during the course of performing an official duty\" that \"reasonably contributes to or facilitates the employee's performance of [an] official duty.\" <i>Brammer-Hoelter v. Twin Peaks Charter Acad.,</i> 492 F.3d 1192, 1203 (10th Cir.2007); <i>see also </i><i>Williams v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist.,</i> 480 F.3d 689, 693 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (\"Activities undertaken in the course of performing one's job are activities pursuant to official duties.\"). On that view, complaints like Mercado-Berrios's might be unprotected, since they could be said to facilitate job performance by removing (or attempting to remove) an obstacle. The D.C. Circuit has explicitly embraced such a view. <i>See </i><i>Winder v. Erste,</i> 566 F.3d 209, 215 (D.C.Cir.2009) (\"[W]e have consistently held that a public employee speaks without First Amendment protection when he reports conduct that interferes with his job responsibilities, even if the report is made outside his chain of command.\").</p>\n<p>In short, there are strong arguments that the \"pursuant to official duties\" doctrine of <i>Garcetti</i> does not apply to Mercado-Berrios's complaints to her superiors, but there are also strong arguments to the contrary. Cancel-Alegría has addressed none of this complexity, focusing only on the daily incident reports filed by Mercado-Berrios despite ample notice of the basis for Mercado-Berrios's speech retaliation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> claim. Even after Mercado-Berrios again clarified her position in her brief to this court, Cancel-Alegría declined to file a reply brief. We will not do a party's work for her. Consequently, we will not address arguments on appeal that Cancel-Alegría might have made, but did not make, about the application of <i>Garcetti</i> to Mercado-Berrios's complaints.<sup>[10]</sup><i>See </i><i>Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro,</i> 843 F.2d 631, 635 (1st Cir.1988) (\"[A] litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly or else forever hold its peace.\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Cancel-Alegría has not contested the sufficiency of the evidence, or made any other argument attacking the speech retaliation claim, the judgment is affirmed as to that claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Cancel-Alegría's final argument is that the damages award is excessive and should have been reduced by the district court.<sup>[11]</sup> \"[T]he measure of damages in section 1983 actions is a matter of federal common law.\" <i>Figueroa-Rodriguez v. Aquino,</i> 863 F.2d 1037, 1045 (1st Cir.1988) (citing <i>Carey v. Piphus,</i> 435 U.S. 247, 257-59, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978), and <i>Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc.,</i> 396 U.S. 229, 238-40, 90 S.Ct. 400, 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969)). Although punitive damages awards are subject to constitutional limits as well, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell,</i> 538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003), Cancel-Alegría has not argued that the award in this case exceeds those limits. We therefore limit our review to whether the award is excessive as a matter of federal common law. <i>See </i><i>Hardeman v. City of Albuquerque,</i> 377 F.3d 1106, 1122 (10th Cir.2004) (applying common law standard because constitutional argument had been forfeited). Under the traditional common law standard, a district court will not disturb the jury's compensatory or punitive damages award unless the award is \"`grossly excessive,' `inordinate,' `shocking to the conscience of the court,' or `so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.'\"<sup>[12]</sup><i>Wagenmann v. Adams,</i> 829 F.2d 196, 215, 216 (1st Cir. 1987) (quoting <i>Segal v. Gilbert Color Sys., Inc.,</i> 746 F.2d 78, 80-81 (1st Cir.1984)); <i>see also</i> 1 Sheldon H. Nahmod, <i>Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties Litigation</i> §§ 4:12, 4:45 (4th ed.2009). We, in turn, review the district court's denial of remittitur for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>McDonough v. City of Quincy,</i> 452 F.3d 8, 22 (1st Cir.2006) (citing <i>Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc.,</i> 518 U.S. 415, 433, 116 S.Ct. 2211, 135 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Compensatory Damages</h2>\n<p>The jury awarded Mercado-Berrios $113,000 for \"loss of earnings, salaries, and benefits\" and $100,000 for \"emotional pain and suffering.\" With respect to the lost earnings, the following facts were either stipulated to or supported by the evidence at trial: Mercado-Berrios earned $2,400 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> per month as a Tourism Transportation Officer; she left the Tourism Company in January of 2004; she earned approximately $900 per month in a secretarial position from March of 2004 until October of 2004; she earned less than $10,000 in 2005; she earned no income in 2006; and she paid approximately $1,000 per year in medical expenses that would otherwise have been covered by her government benefits plan. She also testified that, as of the trial date in 2007, she remained unable to find steady work. On those facts alone, Mercado-Berrios lost approximately $71,000 in income and benefits in the three years after her departure from the Tourism Company.</p>\n<p>Cancel-Alegría presented no evidence to suggest that these figures are inflated or that Mercado-Berrios unreasonably failed to mitigate her damages. Even factoring in taxes, accounting for the likelihood that Mercado-Berrios would eventually find steady employment, and discounting the estimated stream of future income to its present value, <i>cf. </i><i>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Pfeifer,</i> 462 U.S. 523, 103 S.Ct. 2541, 76 L.Ed.2d 768 (1983), we conclude that the jury's award for lost earnings was reasonable. <i>See </i><i>Segal,</i> 746 F.2d at 81 (\"Even in cases ... which involve only economic loss, review must proceed with great deference for the jury's assessment: `the jury is free to select the highest figures for which there is adequate evidentiary support.'\" (quoting <i>Kolb v. Goldring, Inc.,</i> 694 F.2d 869, 872 (1st Cir. 1982))).</p>\n<p>The award for pain and suffering is likewise reasonable. We have recognized that \"converting feelings such as pain, suffering, and mental anguish into dollars is not an exact science. The jury is free `to harmonize the verdict at the highest or lowest points for which there is a sound evidentiary predicate, or anywhere in between ... so long as the end result does not ... strike such a dissonant chord that justice would be denied were the judgment permitted to stand.'\" <i>Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco,</i> 69 F.3d 1184, 1198 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting <i>Milone v. Moceri Family, Inc.,</i> 847 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 1988)). Mercado-Berrios testified at length about the mental and emotional distress she suffered as a consequence of her departure from the Tourism Company. For example, she told the jury that she suffered from so much stress that she was unable to sleep, that her relationships with friends and extended family suffered, and that she eventually had to seek the help of a psychologist. In light of the evidence, we do not find the jury's award \"to cross the outer limit of the wide universe of acceptable awards.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Punitive Damages</h2>\n<p>Because Cancel-Alegría did not challenge the availability of punitive damages below, our review of the award is for excessiveness only. Also, as noted earlier, we will conduct our review under the traditional common law excessiveness standard rather than the Due Process excessiveness standard. The standard is the same as for compensatory damages: the award should not be disturbed unless it is \"`grossly excessive,' `inordinate,' `shocking to the conscience of the court,' or `so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.'\" <i>Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 215, 216; <i>Hardeman,</i> 377 F.3d at 1122. \"[T]he amount of such an award is, in the first instance, committed to the discretion of the nisi prius court,\" <i>Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 216, and we review the district court's excessiveness determination for abuse of discretion only. <i>See </i><i>Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc.,</i> 532 U.S. 424, 433, 121 S.Ct. 1678, 149 L.Ed.2d 674 (2001) (\"If no constitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> issue is raised, the role of the appellate court, at least in the federal system, is merely to review the trial court's determination under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The $1,000,000 award was likely intended to punish Cancel-Alegría both for considering Mercado-Berrios's political affiliation and for considering Mercado-Berrios's protected speech in the refusal to hire her for a permanent position. The alleged political discrimination cannot form the basis for a punitive damages award, however, because it was unsupported by the evidence. The question is thus whether an award of $1,000,000 for speech retaliation is excessive under the circumstances of this case. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p>The conduct in question was undoubtedly reprehensible. Mercado-Berrios testified at trial that there were \"taxi drivers and chauffeurs who [were] not complying with the rules and the traffic laws, putting at risk the lives of human beings.\" In lashing out at an employee for bringing those safety concerns to light, Cancel-Alegría chilled the free flow of information relating to passenger safety and thereby increased the risk that innocent passengers would be harmed. <i>Cf. </i><i>Philip Morris USA v. Williams,</i> 549 U.S. 346, 355, 127 S.Ct. 1057, 166 L.Ed.2d 940 (2007) (noting that risk of harm to the public may be taken into account in measuring reprehensibility).</p>\n<p>At the same time, the retaliation against Mercado-Berrios appears to have been an isolated incident. No other speech-based employment actions were taken against Mercado-Berrios, and there is no evidence that Cancel-Alegría acted similarly against other employees. It is also clear that the award in this case is large for a First Amendment claim in the public employment context. <i>Cf., e.g., </i><i>Rodríguez-Marín v. Rivera-González,</i> 438 F.3d 72, 84 (1st Cir.2006) ($195,000 in punitive damages); <i>Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz Velez,</i> 341 F.3d 86, 102 (1st Cir.2003) ($250,000 in punitive damages).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, few recent cases provide direct guidance on this issue. Courts rarely apply the common law excessiveness standard to punitive damages awards these days, since aggrieved defendants now commonly invoke the arguably stricter due process standard. The Tenth Circuit's decision in <i>Hardeman v. City of Albuquerque</i> is perhaps most on point. The jury in that case found that the defendant mayor denied the plaintiff a contractual severance package worth approximately $40,000 because of the plaintiff's association with African-American groups. 377 F.3d at 1112. The jury awarded $1,000,000 in punitive damages on the claim, which the district judge reduced to $625,000. <i>Id.</i> The Tenth Circuit affirmed under the common law standard. <i>Id.</i> at 1122-23.</p>\n<p>We think a similar approach is appropriate here. An award of $1,000,000 against an individual-capacity defendant based on the conduct proved at trial is \"grossly excessive\" and \"shocking to the conscience of the court.\" <i>Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 215. In our judgment, $500,000 is the maximum award that can be justified on the facts of this case. We therefore vacate the award and remand to the district court for a new trial on punitive damages unless Mercado-Berrios consents to a reduction of her award from $1,000,000 to $500,000.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is <i>AFFIRMED</i> as to the speech retaliation claim and compensatory damages, <i>REVERSED</i> as to the political discrimination claim, and <i>VACATED</i> as to punitive damages. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> The case is <i>REMANDED</i> to the district court for a new trial on punitive damages unless Mercado-Berrios consents in the district court to a reduction of her award from $1,000,000 to $500,000. Each party shall be responsible for its own costs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Mercado-Berrios ended up serving for seven months. In December of 2003, the Executive Director of the Tourism Company extended the transitory appointments for one month because permanent employees had not yet been hired.</p>\n<p>[2]  The district court entered judgment as a matter of law for the other defendants. That ruling is not challenged in the present appeal.</p>\n<p>[3]  This portion of the award constitutes legal damages rather than an equitable award of backpay and frontpay. <i>See </i><i>Negrón-Almeda v. Santiago,</i> 528 F.3d 15, 26-27 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[4]  Neither party disputes that Cancel-Alegría's decision not to hire Mercado-Berrios to a permanent position constitutes an adverse employment action for purposes of the First Amendment claims at issue here. <i>See </i><i>Morales-Tañon v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth.,</i> 524 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[5]  In total, two hundred fifty people applied for twenty permanent positions.</p>\n<p>[6]  In resisting this conclusion, Mercado-Berrios relies heavily on <i>Gutiérrez-Rodríguez v. Cartagena,</i> a due process police brutality case in which we discussed the standard of causation under section 1983. <i>See</i> 882 F.2d 553, 561 (1st Cir.1989) (holding that police officers could be held liable for unconstitutional shooting because they \"directed and participated in the acts that led to the shooting\"). That case is not illuminating here. There is substantial evidence that Cancel-Alegría exercised direct control over the hiring decisions for the Tourism Transportation Division. If there were proof that the decision not to hire Mercado-Berrios to a permanent position was motivated by her political affiliation, Cancel-Alegría could be held liable for having directly \"subject[ed]\" Mercado-Berrios to a deprivation of constitutional rights. 42 U.S.C. § 1983.</p>\n<p>[7]  Cancel-Alegría makes several remarks in her brief that could be taken as allusions to other exceptions. For example, she says that any restriction on Mercado-Berrios' speech was justified because the Tourism Company's \"interest was to intervene with firm hands, but courteous and that the user be the priority.\" That may be a reference to the <i>Pickering</i> balancing test. The argument is not developed, however, and we therefore deem it waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>[8]  As we recently emphasized, this does not mean that the employer must have expressly required the employee to speak. <i>See </i><i>Foley,</i> 598 F.3d at 6; <i>see also </i><i>Weintraub v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 593 F.3d 196, 203 (2d Cir.2010). Many employees enjoy significant discretion in determining what actions ought to be taken \"pursuant to\" their job responsibilities. The voluntary or discretionary aspect of their actions does not exempt them from employer control. <i>See </i><i>Foley,</i> 598 F.3d at 7.</p>\n<p>[9]  For example, the Court referred to speech that \"owes its existence to a public employee's professional responsibilities,\" 547 U.S. at 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951; speech that the employer \"has commissioned or created,\" <i>id.</i> at 422, 126 S.Ct. 1951; speech that the employee \"was paid to\" make, <i>id.</i>; speech that the employee's \"duties ... required him to\" make, <i>id.</i>; speech that amounts to the employee's \"work product,\" <i>id.</i>; and speech that is an \"official communication[ ],\" <i>id.</i> at 423, 126 S.Ct. 1951.</p>\n<p>[10]  We also will not address Cancel-Alegría's qualified immunity argument, which simply refers back to her misguided merits argument.</p>\n<p>[11]  She also argues that the district court should have granted a new trial because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying that request.</p>\n<p>[12]  Because Cancel-Alegría has not raised the issue, we do not consider what effect, if any, the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2605, 171 L.Ed.2d 570 (2008), has had on our section 1983 damages jurisprudence. <i>Cf. </i><i>Mendez v. County of San Bernardino,</i> 540 F.3d 1109, 1122 (9th Cir.2008); <i>Kunz v. DeFelice,</i> 538 F.3d 667, 678 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n\n</div>",

Plaintiff Teresita Mercado-Berrios worked as a transitory government employee in Puerto Rico. Toward the end of her term of employment, she applied for, and was denied, a permanent position. She subsequently filed suit under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that defendant María Cancel-Alegría, who was responsible for the hiring decision, violated the First Amendment by considering her political affiliation and protected speech activity in the hiring decision. After a six-day trial, the jury returned a verdict for Mercado-Berrios on both theories, awarding her $213,000 in compensatory damages and $1,000,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p>Cancel-Alegría now challenges both the imposition of liability and the amount of damages. Considering the arguments that Cancel-Alegría has made, and disregarding others that might have been made but were not, we affirm the judgment as to the speech retaliation claim and compensatory damages, reverse as to the political discrimination claim, vacate the punitive damages award, and remand to the district court for a new trial on punitive damages unless Mercado-Berrios consents to a reduction of her award from $1,000,000 to $500,000.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We draw the facts from the trial record, reciting them in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>Marcano Rivera v. Turabo Medical Ctr. P'ship,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201706\"><a href=\"/opinion/201706/marcano-rivera-v-roldan-millan/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 165 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>The basic factual outline is not in dispute. Plaintiff Teresita Mercado-Berrios' former employer, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company (\"the Tourism Company\" or \"the Company\"), is a public corporation of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23, § 671a. Mercado-Berrios began work as a transitory employee within the Company's Tourism Transportation Division on June 9, 2003. By contract, her term of employment was set to last for six months. Defendant María Cancel-Alegría was the Company's Director of Tourism Transportation at the time.</p>\n<p>The Tourism Transportation Division was a new addition to the Tourism Company when Mercado-Berrios began work. In 2002, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico assigned the Company responsibility for \"[r]egulating, investigating, overseeing, intervening and imposing sanctions to those juridical persons or entities engaged in rendering tourist ground transportation services in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23, § 671e(12). The Tourism Transportation Division was created to perform those new duties. Cancel-Alegría began working in March of 2003 as the only employee within the new <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> division. Because she had only three months to bring the new division to full operational capacity, she initially hired many employees on a transitory basis. She explained that transitory appointments have \"a birth date and an ending\" and are exempt from the ordinary public notice and competitive entrance requirements for civil service positions.</p>\n<p>Mercado-Berrios was one such transitory employee. She left her former job to work for six months as a Tourism Transportation Officer within the Overseeing Division of the Tourism Transportation Division.<sup>[1]</sup> She claims that she was promised that she would be hired on a permanent basis at the end of her transitory appointment. The Tourism Transportation Officers worked in the operational arm of the Tourism Transportation Division, which was known as the Overseeing Division. Their duty stations were primarily at ports and airports. Mercado-Berrios worked at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, where her basic responsibilities were to inspect luxury vehicles and taxis for compliance with Commonwealth safety regulations; to check those vehicles' documentation; to orient tourists regarding ground transportation services; to handle transportation-related complaints; and to submit daily reports on the work she performed. Several layers of management separated Mercado-Berrios from Cancel-Alegía, and the two women had little contact with one another. Cancel-Alegría described the Overseeing Division as \"the most delicate area\" under her supervision because of the constant interaction between her employees and the tourists, drivers, and airport personnel.</p>\n<p>By all accounts, Mercado-Berrios was a conscientious employee who vigorously enforced the safety regulations within her purview. Her supervisors' reviews were consistently glowing. The luxury vehicle and taxi drivers received her efforts with less enthusiasm, however. On several occasions, drivers became angry with Mercado-Berrios for performing inspections in what they perceived to be an overly aggressive manner. The luxury vehicle drivers, in particular, were not accustomed to close scrutiny, and they pressured the Tourism Company to rein in Mercado-Berrios and the other Tourism Transportation Officers.</p>\n<p>In December of 2003, two supervisors instructed the Tourism Transportation Officers to \"hold your horses\" and stop issuing citations to luxury vehicles that were not in compliance with the safety regulations. The officers understood the instruction to have come from Cancel-Alegría. Mercado-Berrios complained to William Ríos-Vázquez, a shift supervisor, that she was \"uncomfortable\" with the new policy because she thought it reflected \"a lack of respect\" for the work she and her co-workers were performing, and because the lax enforcement would put \"the tourist, who is the person that is paying for service, his life was at risk.\" She made similar complaints to two other employees: Cesar Ramos, a shift supervisor, and Julia Palacios, an attorney.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, Mercado-Berrios and a number of her transitory co-workers applied for permanent positions as Tourism Transportation Officers. There was testimony that all the transitory employees expected to be appointed to permanent positions as long as their performance was satisfactory. However, on January 16, 2004, one day after the transitory appointments expired, Mercado-Berrios was told <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> that she would not be appointed to a permanent position and should turn in her identification to the Human Resources Office. Cancel-Alegría later testified that she decided not to recommend Mercado-Berrios for a permanent position because</p>\n<blockquote>there were so many complaints that had been received in the way that she performed the interventions, that we really couldn't afford the luxury ofwell, the clientele that we deal with in transportation, I always say that it is like a minefield. Well, in this case that would happen could certainly, as we Puerto Ricans say, could set off the beehive. So I didn't need personnel that would add more of a situationI didn't need more personnel to add more situations to the ones that they already had.</blockquote>\n<p>The following year, Mercado-Berrios commenced an action in the District of Puerto Rico under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, naming Cancel-Alegría and others as defendants.<sup>[2]</sup> Mercado-Berrios alleged that Cancel-Alegría chose not to appoint her to a permanent position because of her political views and in retaliation for complaining about the \"hold your horses\" instruction, all in violation of the First Amendment. After a six-day trial, the jury returned a verdict for Mercado-Berrios on both claims. The jury awarded Mercado-Berrios $113,000 for lost income and benefits,<sup>[3]</sup> $100,000 for pain and suffering, and $1,000,000 in punitive damages. The district court denied Cancel-Alegría's motions for judgment as a matter of law and her motion for a new trial and/or remittitur. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo. <i>Mass. Eye and Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2009). A Rule 50 motion is properly granted when \"`the facts and inferences viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the movant that a reasonable jury could not have returned the verdict.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Borges Colón v. Román-Abreu,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202046\"><a href=\"/opinion/202046/borges-colon-v-roman-abreu/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p>As framed in the district court's instructions and the verdict form, the question before the jury was whether Cancel-Alegría's decision not to hire Mercado-Berrios to a permanent position was motivated by impermissible considerations. The jury found that two such considerations entered into the hiring decision. First, it found that Cancel-Alegría discriminated against Mercado-Berrios based on Mercado-Berrios' \"political beliefs or ideas.\" Second, it found that Cancel-Alegría retaliated against Mercado-Berrios because of Mercado-Berrios' \"speech activity.\"</p>\n<p>Each of these findings implicates a distinct line of First Amendment cases. Under the first line of cases, government officials are forbidden from taking adverse action against public employees on the basis of political affiliation or belief, unless political loyalty is an appropriate requirement of the position in question. <i>See </i><i>Welch v. Ciampa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203489\"><a href=\"/opinion/203489/welch-v-ciampa/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span>, 938-39 (1st Cir.2008). The second line of cases \"call[s] for a different, though related, inquiry\" when a public employee's speech, rather than her political affiliation or belief, is at issue. <i>O'Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v. City of Northlake,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118060\"><a href=\"/opinion/118060/ohare-truck-service-inc-v-city-of-northlake/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></a></span>, 719, 116 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> S.Ct. 2353, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118060\"><a href=\"/opinion/118060/ohare-truck-service-inc-v-city-of-northlake/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

The basic rule in such cases is that government officials may not take adverse action against a public employee for speaking \"as a citizen on a matter of public concern\" unless there is \"an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.\" <i>Curran v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span> (2006)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Political Discrimination</h2>\n<p>The essence of Mercado-Berrios' political discrimination claim is that she was not hired for a permanent position because she was an insufficiently zealous supporter of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"), as evidenced by her refusal to buy or sell PDP event tickets and her failure to secure an endorsement from a PDP politician.<sup>[4]</sup> The jury agreed, finding that her \"political beliefs or ideas were a substantial or motivating factor\" in Cancel-Alegría's hiring decision. Cancel-Alegría attacks that finding on appeal, arguing that the evidence does not support the jury's conclusion. Having carefully reviewed the trial record, we agree with Cancel-Alegría.</p>\n<p>Several former employees testified that the Tourism Transportation Division was highly politicized, especially during the period between October 2003 and the general election in November 2004. Nearly every employee within the Tourism Transportation Division, including Mercado-Berrios and Cancel-Alegría, was affiliated with the PDP. According to William Ríos-Vázquez, a shift supervisor, it was widely acknowledged that \"political backing\" from a PDP member of the Legislative Assembly was an \"important\" factor in Tourism Transportation Division appointments. Additional testimony revealed that certain employees within the Tourism Transportation Division pressured their co-workers to participate in, or purchase tickets to, PDP events.</p>\n<p>Although there was no evidence that Cancel-Alegría personally pressured her employees, there was testimony that much of the political activity took place in close physical proximity to Cancel-Alegría's office, that Cancel-Alegría spoke \"about political activities and fund raising activities\" on at least one work-related occasion, and that some of the political activity within the Tourism Transportation Division benefitted Cancel-Alegría's brother, a local senator. The jury could reasonably have inferred from this evidence that Cancel-Alegría was aware of, tacitly approved of, and perhaps even encouraged the partisan political activity within her department.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, \"a politically charged atmosphere ..., without more, provide[s] no basis for a reasonable inference that defendant['s] employment decisions about <i>plaintiff</i> were tainted by [her] disregard of <i>plaintiff's</i> first amendment rights.\" <i>LaRou v. Ridlon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197044\"><a href=\"/opinion/197044/larou-v-ridlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span>, 661-62 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541732\"><a href=\"/opinion/541732/jorge-correa-martinez-v-rene-arrillaga-belendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir. 1990)). Even when it is clear that the defendant has a political agenda or harbors political biases, it remains the plaintiff's burden to produce evidence of a causal connection between those biases and the challenged employment action. Such evidence can be direct or circumstantial, and it can come in a wide variety of forms. <i>Cf. </i><i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 828 (1st Cir.1991) (noting in age discrimination <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> and retaliation case that sources of circumstantial evidence of retaliation \"include, but are not limited to, evidence of differential treatment in the workplace, statistical evidence showing disparate treatment, temporal proximity of an employee's protected activity to an employer's adverse action, and comments by the employer which intimate a retaliatory mindset\") (internal citations omitted). Whatever form the evidence takes, however, it must be sufficiently probative to support a finding that the plaintiff's \"protected activity or status was a `substantial or motivating factor' in the [employment] decision, that is, that the protected activity or status was an impetus for, or moved the employer towards, the [employment] decision.\" <i>Costa-Urena v. Segarra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204113\"><a href=\"/opinion/204113/costa-urena-v-segarra/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Mercado-Berrios failed to adduce sufficient evidence of this sort. Most importantly, there was no evidence that Cancel-Alegría was aware of Mercado-Berrios's refusal to buy and sell raffle tickets and to attend PDP events. The two women rarely encountered one another, and they never had any private conversations, let alone politically-oriented discussions or interactions. In addition, nothing suggests that Mercado-Berrios's political beliefs were so widely known that she would have been a \"conspicuous target[ ]\" for discriminatory action. <i>Acevedo-Díaz v. Aponte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627336\"><a href=\"/opinion/627336/franco-acevedo-diaz-v-jose-e-aponte-ada-n-perez-franco-acevedo-diaz-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 69 (1st Cir.1993). In the absence of proof that Cancel-Alegría knew of Mercado-Berrios's unwillingness to participate in PDP political activity, it is difficult to see how that unwillingness could have been a substantial or motivating factor in Cancel-Alegría's hiring decision. <i>See </i><i>Carrasquillo v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Justice Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2007) (\"[I]f Jiménez did not know Carrasquillo's political views, they could not have been a substantial factor motivating any adverse employment action.\").</p>\n<p>The numerical evidence does not buttress Mercado-Berrios's position. Of the twenty-two transitory employees who applied for permanent positions, twelve were not hired.<sup>[5]</sup> Yet Mercado-Berrios never attempted to show that those who were hired were more politically active than those who were not hired. <i>Cf. </i><i>Rodríguez-Ríos v. Cordero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197836\"><a href=\"/opinion/197836/rodriguez-rios-v-cordero/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir. 1998) (plaintiff presented evidence that a reorganization resulted in \"seven PDP-member demotions, with no evidence that any NPP member was either demoted or discharged\"). Although comparative evidence is not necessary, it can be helpful in a case like this where there is little else to suggest that the plaintiff was, or was likely to be, targeted for her political views.</p>\n<p>Mercado-Berrios contends that Cancel-Alegría's stated reason for not hiring herthat she was too aggressive with the taxi and limousine driverswas pretextual. There is no evidence of pretext, however. By all accounts, Mercado-Berrios was not hired because her conscientious job performance upset the limousine drivers, who were not accustomed to close scrutiny. In this regard, she is partly a victim of her own success on the speech retaliation claim. She presented strong evidence that Cancel-Alegría chose not to hire her because she enforced the safety regulations too vigorously and because she complained about the efforts to rein her in. The strength of that evidence highlights the absence of any evidence that her political orientation was an additional factor motivating Cancel-Alegría's hiring decision.</p>\n<p>The most favorable testimony from Mercado-Berrios's perspective came from Eileen Ramos, the head of Human Resources <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> at the Tourism Company, who flatly stated that Cancel-Alegría took political considerations into account in her hiring decisions:</p>\n<blockquote>Q: Now, there has been testimony here today that Ms. Cancel did not at any time take political considerations to make a recommendation for a position. What do you have to say about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>COURT: In relation to a career position, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: In relation to the career positions at the Tourism Transportation Division for the tourism transportation officer position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: I would say that's not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Well, because the career positions that were posted for tourist transportation officer and other positions in that office, well, the human resources office didn't have any participation in the selection of those candidates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Well, in the hiring, meaning in the job announcement, et cetera, yes, we did have participation. But in the selection process, that was done in the Division of Tourist Transportation office, in that department. They made a panel, interviewing panel to interview the people, but we didn't have any participation in the selection.</blockquote>\n<p>Although this evidence gives us pause, we conclude that it falls short of providing a sufficient evidentiary basis for a jury finding in Mercado-Berrios's favor. Ramos concluded that politics must have been taken into account because the Human Resources department had been improperly excluded from the hiring process. But that impression was conclusory and speculative. By her own admission, Ramos had no personal knowledge of the decision-making process. Thus, her opinion is too thin a reed on which to rest the entire jury verdict. Without more, we cannot say that it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that Mercado-Berrios's political beliefs were a substantial or motivating factor in Cancel-Alegría's decision not to hire her.<sup>[6]</sup> We therefore reverse the judgment as to Mercado-Berrios's political discrimination claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Retaliation for Speech</h2>\n<p>In addition to political discrimination, the jury found that Cancel-Alegría refused to hire Mercado-Berrios because she had vocally resisted efforts to stop the safety inspections of luxury vehicles. \"Official reprisal for protected speech offends the Constitution [because] it threatens to inhibit exercise of the protected right, and the law is settled that as a general matter the First Amendment prohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions ... for speaking out.\" <i>Hartman v. Moore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145662\"><a href=\"/opinion/145662/hartman-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span>, 256, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145662\"><a href=\"/opinion/145662/hartman-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span> (2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The general rule holds true in the public employment context: the government is largely forbidden from taking adverse action against its employees in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> retaliation for their protected speech. <i>See </i><i>Rankin v. McPherson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111946\"><a href=\"/opinion/111946/rankin-v-mcpherson/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span>, 383-84, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111946\"><a href=\"/opinion/111946/rankin-v-mcpherson/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Board of Education,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, 568, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></a></span> (1968). Cancel-Alegría invokes on appeal the first of these exceptions, relating to speech made pursuant to the employee's official duties.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos</i><i>,</i> the Supreme Court held that \"the First Amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an employee's expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities.\" 547 U.S. at 424, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>. The relevant inquiry under <i>Garcetti</i> thus has two basic components(1) what are the employee's official responsibilities? and (2) was the speech at issue made pursuant to those responsibilities?both of which are highly context-sensitive. <i>See </i><i>Foley v. Town of Randolph,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"31\"><a href=\"/opinion/31/foley-v-town-of-randolph/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7, 9 (1st Cir.2010) (emphasizing that the context of the plaintiff's speech was \"critical to [the] analysis\" and that the holding was \"limited to the particular facts of this case\"). Moreover, in identifying the employee's job responsibilities, the proper inquiry is \"practical\" rather than formal, focusing on \"the duties an employee actually is expected to perform.\"<sup>[8]</sup><i>Garcetti,</i> 547 U.S. at 424-25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Cancel-Alegría focuses her argument on the daily incident reports in which Mercado-Berrios recorded her interventions with taxis and luxury vehicles. She contends that those reports are not protected by the First Amendment because Mercado-Berrios created and submitted them pursuant to her duties as a Tourism Transportation Officer. That is undoubtedly correct, as Mercado-Berrios herself acknowledged at trial. But as Mercado-Berrios has repeatedly made clearin her testimony, in her opening statement and closing argument at trial, in her opposition to the Rule 50(b) motion, and in her brief on appealthe incident reports are not the basis for her retaliation claim. Rather, her claim is that Cancel-Alegría retaliated against her for <i>complaining</i> about her superiors' interference with the performance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> of her job duties. The relevant question is whether those complaints were made pursuant to her official responsibilities.</p>\n<p>That is not an easy question to answer. On the one hand, Mercado-Berrios's complaints were not made \"pursuant to\" her job duties in the most literal sense. Her responsibilities as a Tourism Transportation Officer were limited to inspecting vehicles, conducting safety interventions, reporting regulatory violations and interventions, and assisting passengers. The record contains no hint that her superiors at the Tourism Company expected her to raise broad policy and safety concerns in carrying out her official duties. Indeed, Cancel-Alegría expressed frustration at Mercado-Berrios' tendency to venture beyond her narrow responsibilities.</p>\n<p><i>Garcetti</i> can be read to suggest that unofficial communications that are not \"part of what [the plaintiff] ... was employed to do,\" like Mercado-Berrios's complaints, fall outside the scope of its rule. 547 U.S. at 421, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>. The Supreme Court was deliberate in its choice of words. It referred thirteen times to speech made \"pursuant to\" an employee's job duties, most notably in its statements of the question presented and the holding. <i>Id.</i> at 413, 421, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>. Elsewhere, it described the relevant class of speech in similar terms.<sup>[9]</sup> The Court did not expressly indicate that it meant to sweep more broadly and include, for example, all speech that relates to, contributes to, or incidentally facilitates the performance of official functions.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, some of the considerations identified in <i>Garcetti,</i> such as the importance of \"affording government employers sufficient discretion to manage their operations,\" <i>id.</i> at 422, may suggest a wider scope. Several courts of appeals, focusing on those cues, have construed the decision to cover all speech made \"during the course of performing an official duty\" that \"reasonably contributes to or facilitates the employee's performance of [an] official duty.\" <i>Brammer-Hoelter v. Twin Peaks Charter Acad.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169475\"><a href=\"/opinion/169475/brammer-hoelter-v-twin-peaks-charter-academy/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1192</span></a></span>, 1203 (10th Cir.2007); <i>see also </i><i>Williams v.

On that view, complaints like Mercado-Berrios's might be unprotected, since they could be said to facilitate job performance by removing (or attempting to remove) an obstacle. The D.C. Circuit has explicitly embraced such a view. <i>See </i><i>Winder v. Erste,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187368\"><a href=\"/opinion/187368/winder-v-erste/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span>, 215 (D.C.Cir.2009) (\"[W]e have consistently held that a public employee speaks without First Amendment protection when he reports conduct that interferes with his job responsibilities, even if the report is made outside his chain of command.\").</p>\n<p>In short, there are strong arguments that the \"pursuant to official duties\" doctrine of <i>Garcetti</i> does not apply to Mercado-Berrios's complaints to her superiors, but there are also strong arguments to the contrary. Cancel-Alegría has addressed none of this complexity, focusing only on the daily incident reports filed by Mercado-Berrios despite ample notice of the basis for Mercado-Berrios's speech retaliation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> claim. Even after Mercado-Berrios again clarified her position in her brief to this court, Cancel-Alegría declined to file a reply brief. We will not do a party's work for her. Consequently, we will not address arguments on appeal that Cancel-Alegría might have made, but did not make, about the application of <i>Garcetti</i> to Mercado-Berrios's complaints.<sup>[10]</sup><i>See </i><i>Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504001\"><a href=\"/opinion/504001/martin-rivera-gomez-v-rafael-adolfo-de-castro/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span>, 635 (1st Cir.1988) (\"[A] litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly or else forever hold its peace.\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span> (1996)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Compensatory Damages</h2>\n<p>The jury awarded Mercado-Berrios $113,000 for \"loss of earnings, salaries, and benefits\" and $100,000 for \"emotional pain and suffering.\" With respect to the lost earnings, the following facts were either stipulated to or supported by the evidence at trial: Mercado-Berrios earned $2,400 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> per month as a Tourism Transportation Officer; she left the Tourism Company in January of 2004; she earned approximately $900 per month in a secretarial position from March of 2004 until October of 2004; she earned less than $10,000 in 2005; she earned no income in 2006; and she paid approximately $1,000 per year in medical expenses that would otherwise have been covered by her government benefits plan. She also testified that, as of the trial date in 2007, she remained unable to find steady work. On those facts alone, Mercado-Berrios lost approximately $71,000 in income and benefits in the three years after her departure from the Tourism Company.</p>\n<p>Cancel-Alegría presented no evidence to suggest that these figures are inflated or that Mercado-Berrios unreasonably failed to mitigate her damages. Even factoring in taxes, accounting for the likelihood that Mercado-Berrios would eventually find steady employment, and discounting the estimated stream of future income to its present value, <i>cf. </i><i>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Pfeifer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110971\"><a href=\"/opinion/110971/jones-laughlin-steel-corp-v-pfeifer/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110971\"><a href=\"/opinion/110971/jones-laughlin-steel-corp-v-pfeifer/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span> (1983), we conclude that the jury's award for lost earnings was reasonable. <i>See </i><i>Segal,</i> 746 F.2d at 81 (\"Even in cases ... which involve only economic loss, review must proceed with great deference for the jury's assessment: `the jury is free to select the highest figures for which there is adequate evidentiary support.'\" (quoting <i>Kolb v. Goldring, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411646\"><a href=\"/opinion/411646/30-fair-emplpraccas-633-30-empl-prac-dec-p-33169-theodore-kolb-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span>, 872 (1st Cir. 1982))).</p>\n<p>The award for pain and suffering is likewise reasonable. We have recognized that \"converting feelings such as pain, suffering, and mental anguish into dollars is not an exact science. The jury is free `to harmonize the verdict at the highest or lowest points for which there is a sound evidentiary predicate, or anywhere in between ... so long as the end result does not ... strike such a dissonant chord that justice would be denied were the judgment permitted to stand.'\" <i>Correa v. Hosp.

Mercado-Berrios testified at length about the mental and emotional distress she suffered as a consequence of her departure from the Tourism Company. For example, she told the jury that she suffered from so much stress that she was unable to sleep, that her relationships with friends and extended family suffered, and that she eventually had to seek the help of a psychologist. In light of the evidence, we do not find the jury's award \"to cross the outer limit of the wide universe of acceptable awards.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Punitive Damages</h2>\n<p>Because Cancel-Alegría did not challenge the availability of punitive damages below, our review of the award is for excessiveness only. Also, as noted earlier, we will conduct our review under the traditional common law excessiveness standard rather than the Due Process excessiveness standard. The standard is the same as for compensatory damages: the award should not be disturbed unless it is \"`grossly excessive,' `inordinate,' `shocking to the conscience of the court,' or `so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.'\" <i>Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 215, 216; <i>Hardeman,</i> 377 F.3d at 1122. \"[T]he amount of such an award is, in the first instance, committed to the discretion of the nisi prius court,\" <i>Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 216, and we review the district court's excessiveness determination for abuse of discretion only. <i>See </i><i>Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118424\"><a href=\"/opinion/118424/cooper-industries-inc-v-leatherman-tool-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 433, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118424\"><a href=\"/opinion/118424/cooper-industries-inc-v-leatherman-tool-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (2001) (\"If no constitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> issue is raised, the role of the appellate court, at least in the federal system, is merely to review the trial court's determination under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The $1,000,000 award was likely intended to punish Cancel-Alegría both for considering Mercado-Berrios's political affiliation and for considering Mercado-Berrios's protected speech in the refusal to hire her for a permanent position. The alleged political discrimination cannot form the basis for a punitive damages award, however, because it was unsupported by the evidence. The question is thus whether an award of $1,000,000 for speech retaliation is excessive under the circumstances of this case. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p>The conduct in question was undoubtedly reprehensible. Mercado-Berrios testified at trial that there were \"taxi drivers and chauffeurs who [were] not complying with the rules and the traffic laws, putting at risk the lives of human beings.\" In lashing out at an employee for bringing those safety concerns to light, Cancel-Alegría chilled the free flow of information relating to passenger safety and thereby increased the risk that innocent passengers would be harmed. <i>Cf. </i><i>Philip Morris USA v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145758\"><a href=\"/opinion/145758/philip-morris-usa-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span>, 355, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145758\"><a href=\"/opinion/145758/philip-morris-usa-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></a></span> (2007) (noting that risk of harm to the public may be taken into account in measuring reprehensibility).</p>\n<p>At the same time, the retaliation against Mercado-Berrios appears to have been an isolated incident. No other speech-based employment actions were taken against Mercado-Berrios, and there is no evidence that Cancel-Alegría acted similarly against other employees. It is also clear that the award in this case is large for a First Amendment claim in the public employment context. <i>Cf., e.g., </i><i>Rodríguez-Marín v. Rivera-González,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2006) ($195,000 in punitive damages); <i>Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz Velez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783291\"><a href=\"/opinion/783291/santos-rivera-torres-daisy-nazario-santana-conjugal-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 102 (1st Cir.2003) ($250,000 in punitive damages).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, few recent cases provide direct guidance on this issue. Courts rarely apply the common law excessiveness standard to punitive damages awards these days, since aggrieved defendants now commonly invoke the arguably stricter due process standard. The Tenth Circuit's decision in <i>Hardeman v. City of Albuquerque</i> is perhaps most on point. The jury in that case found that the defendant mayor denied the plaintiff a contractual severance package worth approximately $40,000 because of the plaintiff's association with African-American groups. 377 F.3d at 1112. The jury awarded $1,000,000 in punitive damages on the claim, which the district judge reduced to $625,000. <i>Id.</i> The Tenth Circuit affirmed under the common law standard. <i>Id.</i> at 1122-23.</p>\n<p>We think a similar approach is appropriate here. An award of $1,000,000 against an individual-capacity defendant based on the conduct proved at trial is \"grossly excessive\" and \"shocking to the conscience of the court.\" <i>Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 215. In our judgment, $500,000 is the maximum award that can be justified on the facts of this case. We therefore vacate the award and remand to the district court for a new trial on punitive damages unless Mercado-Berrios consents to a reduction of her award from $1,000,000 to $500,000.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is <i>AFFIRMED</i> as to the speech retaliation claim and compensatory damages, <i>REVERSED</i> as to the political discrimination claim, and <i>VACATED</i> as to punitive damages. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> The case is <i>REMANDED</i> to the district court for a new trial on punitive damages unless Mercado-Berrios consents in the district court to a reduction of her award from $1,000,000 to $500,000. Each party shall be responsible for its own costs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Mercado-Berrios ended up serving for seven months. In December of 2003, the Executive Director of the Tourism Company extended the transitory appointments for one month because permanent employees had not yet been hired.</p>\n<p>[2]  The district court entered judgment as a matter of law for the other defendants. That ruling is not challenged in the present appeal.</p>\n<p>[3]  This portion of the award constitutes legal damages rather than an equitable award of backpay and frontpay. <i>See </i><i>Negrón-Almeda v. Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203315\"><a href=\"/opinion/203315/negron-almeda-v-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 26-27 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[4]  Neither party disputes that Cancel-Alegría's decision not to hire Mercado-Berrios to a permanent position constitutes an adverse employment action for purposes of the First Amendment claims at issue here. <i>See </i><i>Morales-Tañon v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203250\"><a href=\"/opinion/203250/morales-tanon-v-puerto-rico-elec-power-auth/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[5]  In total, two hundred fifty people applied for twenty permanent positions.</p>\n<p>[6]  In resisting this conclusion, Mercado-Berrios relies heavily on <i>Gutiérrez-Rodríguez v. Cartagena,</i> a due process police brutality case in which we discussed the standard of causation under section 1983. <i>See</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527780\"><a href=\"/opinion/527780/carlos-a-gutierrez-rodriguez-v-desiderio-cartagena-and-domingo-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span>, 561 (1st Cir.1989) (holding that police officers could be held liable for unconstitutional shooting because they \"directed and participated in the acts that led to the shooting\"). That case is not illuminating here. There is substantial evidence that Cancel-Alegría exercised direct control over the hiring decisions for the Tourism Transportation Division. If there were proof that the decision not to hire Mercado-Berrios to a permanent position was motivated by her political affiliation, Cancel-Alegría could be held liable for having directly \"subject[ed]\" Mercado-Berrios to a deprivation of constitutional rights. 42 U.S.C. § 1983.</p>\n<p>[7]  Cancel-Alegría makes several remarks in her brief that could be taken as allusions to other exceptions. For example, she says that any restriction on Mercado-Berrios' speech was justified because the Tourism Company's \"interest was to intervene with firm hands, but courteous and that the user be the priority.\" That may be a reference to the <i>Pickering</i> balancing test. The argument is not developed, however, and we therefore deem it waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>[8]  As we recently emphasized, this does not mean that the employer must have expressly required the employee to speak. <i>See </i><i>Foley,</i> 598 F.3d at 6; <i>see also </i><i>Weintraub v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405173\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405173/weintraub-v-board-of-educ-of-city-of-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 203 (2d Cir.2010). Many employees enjoy significant discretion in determining what actions ought to be taken \"pursuant to\" their job responsibilities. The voluntary or discretionary aspect of their actions does not exempt them from employer control. <i>See </i><i>Foley,</i> 598 F.3d at 7.</p>\n<p>[9]  For example, the Court referred to speech that \"owes its existence to a public employee's professional responsibilities,\" 547 U.S. at 421, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>[10]  We also will not address Cancel-Alegría's qualified immunity argument, which simply refers back to her misguided merits argument.</p>\n<p>[11]  She also argues that the district court should have granted a new trial because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying that request.</p>\n<p>[12]  Because Cancel-Alegría has not raised the issue, we do not consider what effect, if any, the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145779\"><a href=\"/opinion/145779/exxon-shipping-co-v-baker/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
