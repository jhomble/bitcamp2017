These  are  cross-appeals\n                                   \n\narising from the conviction of defendant Patience O. Udechukwu, a\n\nNigerian  citizen  and U.S.  resident,  for serving  as  a heroin\n\ncourier  from Aruba  to the  United  States, in  violation of  21\n\nU.S.C.     841(a)(1)  (possession of  controlled substances  with\n\nintent  to distribute),  952(a)  (importing such  substances into\n\nU.S.  customs territory), and  955 (possession on  an aircraft of\n\ncontrolled substances not listed in the cargo manifest).  \n\n     Defendant's  principal   claims  on  appeal  are   that  the\n\ngovernment  improperly  failed  to disclose  the  results  of its\n\ninvestigation  into  information  she  provided about  her  Aruba\n\nsource  of supply,  and that  the  prosecutor's closing  argument\n\ndeliberately  suggested the contrary  of the  facts known  to the\n\ngovernment.     The  government  appeals  the  sentence  imposed,\n\nclaiming that the court lacked authority  to depart downward from\n\nthe  applicable minimum  mandatory sentence  of  60 months  to 41\n\nmonths in the  absence of a prosecution motion  requesting such a\n\ndeparture. \n\n     Since we conclude that the  conviction must be set aside and\n\na new trial granted, we do not reach the government's appeal.\n\n                        Defendant's Arrest\n                                          \n\n     On June 26, 1992, defendant was the last to leave flight 627\n\nafter its  arrival in  San  Juan, Puerto  Rico,  from Aruba.    A\n\ncustoms  inspector, having  asked  for  and received  defendant's\n\nCustoms  Declaration  Card,  proceeded  with   an  inspection  of\n\ndefendant's luggage  and person.   Although  nothing unusual  was\n\n                               -3-\n\nrevealed  by the  inspection, the  inspector  became increasingly\n\nsuspicious because of defendant's nervous demeanor, her statement\n\nthat she had  just returned from visiting her boyfriend (although\n\nher  passport  revealed  her  married   status),  her  subsequent\n\nstatement that she  did not know the whereabouts  of her husband,\n\nand her professed ignorance of her  ticket's scheduled layover in\n\nChicago.\n\n     A  computer  check  revealed no  \"intelligence  lookouts\" or\n\ncriminal  involvements recorded in  defendant's name and  a \"pat-\n\ndown\"  authorized by the inspector's supervisor also had negative\n\nresults.   Then,  on  suspicion that  defendant was  an \"internal\n\nswallower,\"    a  customs  special  agent,  Ana  Rolon,  obtained\n\ndefendant's consent to an x-ray.  She was then taken to a medical\n\ncenter.    As she  disrobed,  she  was  observed putting  in  her\n\nclothing an object which was soon seized by agent Rolon, observed\n\nto be a round pellet wrapped in  electrical tape inside a condom,\n\nthen  field tested  and shown  to be  heroin.   Meanwhile, x-rays\n\nrevealed three foreign  bodies in defendant's rectum.   Defendant\n\nwas arrested  as soon  as the field-test  results were  known and\n\nlater  expelled the  three  foreign objects,  which proved  to be\n\nsimilar pellets  of heroin powder.   A fifth pellet was  found in\n\nthe  automobile that transported defendant to the medical center.\n\nThe total quantity of heroin recovered was 395 grams.\n\n                    Defendant's Duress Defense\n                                              \n\n     As  the  above   scenario  suggests,  the  objective   facts\n\nconcerning defendant's  possession and  importation were  clearly\n\n                               -4-\n\nestablished.  Defendant's  defense was that she  had been coerced\n\ninto her role as a courier by the man she had visited in Aruba.  \n\n     Immediately  after her arrest,  late on a  Friday afternoon,\n\ndefendant was brought  before a U.S. magistrate judge.   When she\n\nwas told  there would be  no detention hearing until  Monday, she\n\nsaid that Monday  would be too late  and that she needed  to talk\n\nwith someone right away.   The magistrate judge then undertook to\n\nobtain counsel for appellant, and succeeded in reaching Assistant\n\nFederal Public Defender Brill, who has represented appellant ever\n\nsince.  After  talking with appellant, Brill  told the magistrate\n\njudge  that the  source  of the  drugs was  in Aruba,  that their\n\ndestination was Chicago,  and that appellant wanted  to cooperate\n\nwith the government and make  a controlled delivery in Chicago on\n\nthe following day, June 27, since the prospective recipient might\n\nstill be expecting a phone call from Udechukwu.   \n\n     In  following up on  her client's offer,  attorney Brill was\n\nreferred by  a customs supervisor  to an assistant  United States\n\nattorney.  The government attorney proved to be unavailable  over\n\nthe weekend, however, and no  controlled delivery took place.  On\n\nMonday, June 29, appellant was debriefed by agents Rolon and Baez\n\nin  counsel Brill's  presence.   Contemporaneous  notes taken  by\n\nagent   Baez  were  apparently   the  basis  for   a  \"Report  of\n\nInvestigation\" issued  some two months  later, on August  25, ten\n\ndays before the commencement of trial. \n\n     According to the report, appellant told the agents of a long\n\nacquaintance with a fellow Nigerian, whose name was then recorded\n\n                               -5-\n\nas Michael Mouhma, who had lived with appellant and her family in\n\n1982 for six  months.  Michael had  returned for a visit  in 1988\n\nbut,  for some  untold reason,  had  his visa  canceled in  1992.\n\nMichael recently had called appellant  from Aruba, asking her  to\n\ncome and threatening  that \"it would only  take one call to  hurt\n\nher  and her kids if she did not  come . . . .\"  Defendant bought\n\nher air ticket, using her Visa card.  In Aruba Michael instructed\n\nher to take the contraband to an individual  in Chicago who could\n\nbe reached on a certain beeper number;  he would buy her a return\n\ntrip ticket and  give her the money for Michael.   Michael forced\n\nher to carry the contraband in her vagina and rectum, telling her\n\nthat  her  husband had  been  arrested  in  Mexico in  1989  when\n\ncarrying drugs from Aruba because he did  not follow instructions\n\nto carry  the contraband  internally.   Defendant  had given  the\n\nphone number of  Michael's Aruba hotel room to agent Rolon at the\n\ntime of her arrest.\n\n     At trial, defendant  expanded on this summary.   She told of\n\nher husband's effort  in 1989 to  assist bringing Nigerians  into\n\nthe  United  States,  which  she believed  had  resulted  in  his\n\nincarceration in Mexico since that time.  In his recent call from\n\nAruba,  Michael proposed  that she  join him  in a  visit to  her\n\nhusband.   She was afraid  to travel alone  to Mexico  and, after\n\ntalking with  her children, bought a ticket for $1,400.  When she\n\narrived in Aruba, Michael met her, took  her to a hotel, took her\n\npassport, \"green card,\"  and room key,  and later told  her of  a\n\nchange in plans.  Instead of going immediately to Mexico, she was\n\n                               -6-\n\nto  carry some  packages  for  him to  Chicago.   To  ensure  her\n\ncompliance, he threatened  that he knew Mafia people  and that it\n\nwould take only  a phone  call to  \"get action.\"   He knew  where\n\ndefendant  lived, where she  worked, where  her children  went to\n\nschool.  She  felt she could not  escape and the hotel  phone did\n\nnot  work.   Michael finally  assisted in  inserting some  of the\n\npellets.   The day  after she  was apprehended  in San Juan,  she\n\ncalled a friend  in San Diego, told her  about Michael's threats,\n\nand  arranged to have her  seven children cared  for by the local\n\nNigerian community.\n\n                     What the Government Knew\n                                             \n\n     Defendant's duress defense was closely tied to her counsel's\n\nefforts  to  obtain  evidence  from  the  government  that  would\n\ncorroborate  her account  of what  had happened.   In particular,\n\ndefendant sought corroboration of  her identification of  Michael\n\nas the source of the drugs she had carried.  Although she did not\n\nknow of the  extent of Michael's involvement  in drug trafficking\n\nuntil  after  her trial,  she  argues that  the  government knew,\n\nbefore trial, that Michael Mouma (his correct surname) had been a\n\ndrug  trafficker and government target for  several years.  Since\n\nthe issue of government knowledge  is critical to this appeal, we\n\nsummarize the record.\n\n     1.  Before trial.    From  the  beginning,  defense  counsel\n                     \n\nstressed defendant's willingness to cooperate.  On the day of her\n\narrest,  June  26,  counsel had  conveyed  defendant's  desire to\n\nparticipate in a controlled delivery  in Chicago.  At defendant's\n\n                               -7-\n\ndebriefing on  June 29, she  gave to the arresting  officials the\n\nname of her source, which was transcribed as Michael Mouhma.  The\n\nagents already had  seized a piece of paper  with Michael's Aruba\n\nhotel room telephone number.  In  a letter dated July 2,  defense\n\ncounsel  had written  the prosecutor  of  her conversations  with\n\ndefendant, closing with  a request to be  kept up to date  \"as to\n\nany further developments.\" \n\n     Trial was scheduled  for September 4.  On  August 4, defense\n\ncounsel moved for  the production of  any exculpatory and  Jencks\n\nAct  material, see  18 U.S.C.    3500;  on August  28, the  court\n                  \n\ngranted the requests.  \n\n     2. At trial.   On September 4,  the first day of  trial, the\n                \n\nprosecution delivered  to defendant a  \"Report of  Investigation\"\n\nthat had been prepared on August 25.  This report referred to \"an\n\nindividual later identified as Michael MOUHMA (MICHAEL),\" related\n\ndefendant's account  of her  being threatened,  but contained  no\n\nfurther information about Michael.\n\n     Upon  being  pressed at  trial  for what,  if  anything, the\n\ngovernment  had learned from  information given it  by defendant,\n\ncustoms agent Rolon testified:\n\n          The name  -- the  name that she  gave me  was only\n     Michael.  She just  gave me and she wrote in  the piece\n     of paper what she thought [] was his last  name.  Okay?\n     With what she  gave me I find nothing,  but based on my\n     experience  I started digging  into and looking  for it\n     with  what I  have, and  I started  like matching  some\n     facts . . . .\n                              * * *\n          I have --  we started with the information  that I\n     received  based on all the  documents that we find, the\n     numbers, this and that on the  -- on a person that  has\n     been  detained.   I keep  a copy  and start  doing some\n\n                               -8-\n\n     investigation  as to  who it  belongs,  et cetera,  the\n     subscribe -- the telephone  subscriber. . . .  It takes\n     time because I  depend on different agencies,  and some\n     information is --  it's protected by the .  . . privacy\n     act.\n\nAs  a result of  defendant's information, agent  Rolon said, \"the\n\nother name help[ed]  in a way to  identify that there is  another\n\nassociation or organization which involves . . . the source . . .\n\nin Aruba.\"\n\n     3.  Post trial.   After  trial, on  September 18,  defendant\n                   \n\nmoved for the production  of any rough notes made  by agent Rolon\n\nrelating to  the \"ongoing  investigation\" she  had alluded  to in\n\ntestimony.  The government's written reply stated that only agent\n\nBaez had made notes at the debriefing, which were then submitted,\n\nrevealing  nothing  differing  in substance  from  the  August 25\n\nreport.  The government added:\n\n     Let the  record be  clear in  that defendant's  limited\n     cooperation has NOT resulted in any  new investigation.\n     What little she was willing to offer was relayed by S/A\n     Ana Rolon to  an off-district agency which  ALREADY had\n     an ongoing  investigation  into  the  relevant  subject\n     matter at  the time  defendant was  arrested in  Puerto\n     Rico.\n\n     4. Oral argument on appeal.  At oral argument before us, the\n                               \n\nprosecutor  stressed  that  the  cooperation  of  defendant   was\n\nlimited, that  the last name  of her source had  been misspelled,\n\nbut that at some point he had been tracked down.   The prosecutor\n\nacknowledged that  not only had  Michael been identified,  but he\n\nhad been  a target since  1988.  Although the  prosecutor further\n\nargued that this fact was made known to the defense before trial,\n\n                               -9-\n\nhe referred  to a page in the record that contains no information\n\nabout Michael's known relationship to the drug trade.\n\n                The Prosecution's Closing Argument\n                                                  \n\n     Against  this  background  of  non-disclosure  of  not  only\n\nMichael Mouma's  existence but of  his known prominence  for some\n\nfour  years  as  a  targeted  drug  trafficker,  we  examine  the\n\nprosecution's closing argument.   In so doing, we  stress that we\n\nspecifically  put to  one  side  defendant's  argument  that  the\n\ngovernment  had the duty to follow up with a prompt and energetic\n\ninvestigation on the basis of the  information given by her.  How\n\nthe government chooses to invest its resources is a matter solely\n\nof its own concern.\n\n     But if the government does  find that information given by a\n\ndefendant proves to  be accurate, this is of  significance to the\n\ndefense  and   its  interest  in  strengthening  the  defendant's\n\ncredibility.    In this  case the  fact that  there was  indeed a\n\nMichael  in  Aruba with  a  surname  strikingly similar  to  that\n\nreported   by  defendant  would   have  given  some   support  to\n\ndefendant's story.  And the  fact that this person had long  been\n\nknown  as a drug trafficker would  have enhanced considerably the\n\nbelievability of defendant's story of being threatened by someone\n\nwho had the  capacity to make good  on his threats.   Whether the\n\ngovernment's failure  to disclose  this credibility-strengthening\n\ninformation could  be said  to be reversible  error, we  need not\n\ndecide.   We  have  no  doubt,  however,  that  the  prosecutor's\n\npersistent theme in closing argument suggesting  the nonexistence\n\n                               -10-\n\nof  this  information  --  and  even the  opposite  of  what  the\n\ngovernment knew -- did fatally taint the trial.\n\n     The prosecutor's closing argument began by raising doubts as\n\nto  defendant's story, referring  to Michael in  skeptical terms.\n\nThe prosecutor noted defendant's plan to go to Aruba, not Mexico,\n\n\"to meet  with this person  she calls Michael.\"   He subsequently\n\nmade reference to \"this man, whomever he -- he is which she calls\n\nMichael,  [who]  was  indeed  her   boyfriend.\"    And  he  again\n\nimplicitly questioned  Michael's existence  when commenting  upon\n\nher claim that  she did not learn  of any threat until  after she\n\nreached Aruba and \"was advised by this alleged Michael that there\n\nwas a threat  against her children.\"  Innuendo  then escalated to\n\ncontradiction.    After  challenging defendant's  credibility  by\n\npointing out how long it had  taken for her to tell anyone  about\n\nMichael's  threats against  her children,  the  prosecutor noted,\n\n\"One  more thing which you need to keep  in mind as you listen to\n\ndefendant's argument and that is whether this Michael in Aruba is\n\nreally a drug  -- whether he really exists,  whether there really\n\nis a drug source besides the defendant.\"\n\n     At this  point defense counsel  objected.  She  argued that,\n\nwhile  foreclosed   for  confidentiality   reasons  from   asking\n\nquestions   about  the   government's   investigation  into   the\n\ninformation  provided by  defendant, \"I  do not believe  that the\n\ngovernment should now be able  to argue that that information has\n\nled to nowhere or that it is meaningless and that  something else\n\nwas the  truth.\"  In  response, the prosecutor explained  that he\n\n                               -11-\n\nwas  pointing to  the  unlikelihood that  \"this  guy\" would  send\n\ndefendant to  Chicago with no  round trip  ticket or  information\n\nabout how much  money was supposed  to be returned  to him.   The\n\ncourt allowed  the government to  argue that it would  strain the\n\nimagination to accept that \"the guy\" in Aruba entrusted defendant\n\nwith  a  quarter  million   dollars  worth  of  heroin   with  no\n\ninstructions concerning  how much  money she was  to bring  back.\n\nNot being content with this thrust, the prosecution added a final\n\nsally  in rebuttal by  asserting that defendant's  children could\n\nnot have been in trouble or she would have reacted sooner: \"[s]he\n\ndidn't want  to stop Michael  or whomever his --  or whatever his\n\nname is.  She wanted to stop us from catching her.\"\n\n     Most  of this was  legitimate argument.   The inferences and\n\nthe direct challenge to the  existence of a source named Michael,\n\nhowever,  when the  prosecution had  unearthed  evidence that  he\n\nexisted and was a prominent dealer in narcotics, is indefensible.\n\nHere  we find  a  kind of  double-acting  prosecutorial error:  a\n\nfailure to communicate salient information, which, under Brady v.\n                                                              \n\nMaryland, 373  U.S. 83 (1963),  and Giglio v. United  States, 405\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  150 (1972),  should  be  disclosed to  the  defense, and  a\n\ndeliberate insinuation that the truth is  to the contrary.  As we\n\npointed out  in United States  v. Smith, 982  F.2d 681,  683 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1993),  \"it [is] not improper  to urge the  jury to evaluate\n\nthe plausibility of  the justification  defense in  light of  the\n\nother  evidence  (and the  lack  thereof),\"  but  \"it is  plainly\n\nimproper  for a  prosecutor  to imply  reliance  on knowledge  or\n\n                               -12-\n\nevidence not available to the jury.\"  It is all the more improper\n\nto  imply reliance  on a  fact that  the prosecutor  knows to  be\n\nuntrue, or  to question the existence of  someone who is known by\n\nthe prosecution to exist.\n\n     In United  States v.

Udechukwu, a Nigerian citizen and U.S. resident, for serving as a heroin courier from Aruba to the United States, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Secs. 841(a)(1) (possession of controlled substances with intent to distribute), 952(a) (importing such substances into U.S. customs territory), and 955 (possession on an aircraft of controlled substances not listed in the cargo manifest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's principal claims on appeal are that the government improperly failed to disclose the results of its investigation into information she provided about her Aruba source of supply, and that the prosecutor's closing argument deliberately suggested the contrary of the facts known to the government.  The government appeals the sentence imposed, claiming that the court lacked authority to depart downward from the applicable minimum mandatory sentence of 60 months to 41 months in the absence of a prosecution motion requesting such a departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since we conclude that the conviction must be set aside and a new trial granted, we do not reach the government's appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Defendant's Arrest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, 1992, defendant was the last to leave flight 627 after its arrival in San Juan, Puerto Rico, from Aruba.  A customs inspector, having asked for and received defendant's Customs Declaration Card, proceeded with an inspection of defendant's luggage and person.  Although nothing unusual was revealed by the inspection, the inspector became increasingly suspicious because of defendant's nervous demeanor, her statement that she had just returned from visiting her boyfriend (although her passport revealed her married status), her subsequent statement that she did not know the whereabouts of her husband, and her professed ignorance of her ticket's scheduled layover in Chicago.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A computer check revealed no \"intelligence lookouts\" or criminal involvements recorded in defendant's name and a \"pat-down\" authorized by the inspector's supervisor also had negative results.  Then, on suspicion that defendant was an \"internal swallower,\" a customs special agent, Ana Rolon, obtained defendant's consent to an x-ray.  She was then taken to a medical center.  As she disrobed, she was observed putting in her clothing an object which was soon seized by agent Rolon, observed to be a round pellet wrapped in electrical tape inside a condom, then field tested and shown to be heroin.  Meanwhile, x-rays revealed three foreign bodies in defendant's rectum.  Defendant was arrested as soon as the field-test results were known and later expelled the three foreign objects, which proved to be similar pellets of heroin powder.  A fifth pellet was found in the automobile that transported defendant to the medical center.  The total quantity of heroin recovered was 395 grams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Defendant's Duress Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the above scenario suggests, the objective facts concerning defendant's possession and importation were clearly established.  Defendant's defense was that she had been coerced into her role as a courier by the man she had visited in Aruba.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately after her arrest, late on a Friday afternoon, defendant was brought before a U.S. magistrate judge.  When she was told there would be no detention hearing until Monday, she said that Monday would be too late and that she needed to talk with someone right away.  The magistrate judge then undertook to obtain counsel for appellant, and succeeded in reaching Assistant Federal Public Defender Brill, who has represented appellant ever since.  After talking with appellant, Brill told the magistrate judge that the source of the drugs was in Aruba, that their destination was Chicago, and that appellant wanted to cooperate with the government and make a controlled delivery in Chicago on the following day, June 27, since the prospective recipient might still be expecting a phone call from Udechukwu.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In following up on her client's offer, attorney Brill was referred by a customs supervisor to an assistant United States attorney.  The government attorney proved to be unavailable over the weekend, however, and no controlled delivery took place.  On Monday, June 29, appellant was debriefed by agents Rolon and Baez in counsel Brill's presence.  Contemporaneous notes taken by agent Baez were apparently the basis for a \"Report of Investigation\" issued some two months later, on August 25, ten days before the commencement of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the report, appellant told the agents of a long acquaintance with a fellow Nigerian, whose name was then recorded as Michael Mouhma, who had lived with appellant and her family in 1982 for six months.  Michael had returned for a visit in 1988 but, for some untold reason, had his visa canceled in 1992.  Michael recently had called appellant from Aruba, asking her to come and threatening that \"it would only take one call to hurt her and her kids if she did not come....\"  Defendant bought her air ticket, using her Visa card.  In Aruba Michael instructed her to take the contraband to an individual in Chicago who could be reached on a certain beeper number;  he would buy her a return trip ticket and give her the money for Michael.  Michael forced her to carry the contraband in her vagina and rectum, telling her that her husband had been arrested in Mexico in 1989 when carrying drugs from Aruba because he did not follow instructions to carry the contraband internally.  Defendant had given the phone number of Michael's Aruba hotel room to agent Rolon at the time of her arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, defendant expanded on this summary.  She told of her husband's effort in 1989 to assist bringing Nigerians into the United States, which she believed had resulted in his incarceration in Mexico since that time.  In his recent call from Aruba, Michael proposed that she join him in a visit to her husband.  She was afraid to travel alone to Mexico and, after talking with her children, bought a ticket for $1,400.  When she arrived in Aruba, Michael met her, took her to a hotel, took her passport, \"green card,\" and room key, and later told her of a change in plans.  Instead of going immediately to Mexico, she was to carry some packages for him to Chicago.  To ensure her compliance, he threatened that he knew Mafia people and that it would take only a phone call to \"get action.\"   He knew where defendant lived, where she worked, where her children went to school.  She felt she could not escape and the hotel phone did not work.  Michael finally assisted in inserting some of the pellets.  The day after she was apprehended in San Juan, she called a friend in San Diego, told her about Michael's threats, and arranged to have her seven children cared for by the local Nigerian community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>What the Government Knew</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's duress defense was closely tied to her counsel's efforts to obtain evidence from the government that would corroborate her account of what had happened.  In particular, defendant sought corroboration of her identification of Michael as the source of the drugs she had carried.  Although she did not know of the extent of Michael's involvement in drug trafficking until after her trial, she argues that the government knew, before trial, that Michael Mouma (his correct surname) had been a drug trafficker and government target for several years.  Since the issue of government knowledge is critical to this appeal, we summarize the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Before trial.   From the beginning, defense counsel stressed defendant's willingness to cooperate.  On the day of her arrest, June 26, counsel had conveyed defendant's desire to participate in a controlled delivery in Chicago.  At defendant's debriefing on June 29, she gave to the arresting officials the name of her source, which was transcribed as Michael Mouhma.  The agents already had seized a piece of paper with Michael's Aruba hotel room telephone number.  In a letter dated July 2, defense counsel had written the prosecutor of her conversations with defendant, closing with a request to be kept up to date \"as to any further developments.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial was scheduled for September 4.  On August 4, defense counsel moved for the production of any exculpatory and Jencks Act material, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500;  on August 28, the court granted the requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. At trial.   On September 4, the first day of trial, the prosecution delivered to defendant a \"Report of Investigation\" that had been prepared on August 25.  This report referred to \"an individual later identified as Michael MOUHMA (MICHAEL),\" related defendant's account of her being threatened, but contained no further information about Michael.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon being pressed at trial for what, if anything, the government had learned from information given it by defendant, customs agent Rolon testified:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The name--the name that she gave me was only Michael.  She just gave me and she wrote in the piece of paper what she thought [ ] was his last name.  Okay?  With what she gave me I find nothing, but based on my experience I started digging into and looking for it with what I have, and I started like matching some facts....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have--we started with the information that I received based on all the documents that we find, the numbers, this and that on the--on a person that has been detained.  I keep a copy and start doing some investigation as to who it belongs, et cetera, the subscribe--the telephone subscriber....  It takes time because I depend on different agencies, and some information is--it's protected by the ... privacy act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of defendant's information, agent Rolon said, \"the other name help[ed] in a way to identify that there is another association or organization which involves ... the source ... in Aruba.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Post trial.   After trial, on September 18, defendant moved for the production of any rough notes made by agent Rolon relating to the \"ongoing investigation\" she had alluded to in testimony.  The government's written reply stated that only agent Baez had made notes at the debriefing, which were then submitted, revealing nothing differing in substance from the August 25 report.  The government added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Let the record be clear in that defendant's limited cooperation has NOT resulted in any new investigation.  What little she was willing to offer was relayed by S/A Ana Rolon to an off-district agency which ALREADY had an ongoing investigation into the relevant subject matter at the time defendant was arrested in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Oral argument on appeal.   At oral argument before us, the prosecutor stressed that the cooperation of defendant was limited, that the last name of her source had been misspelled, but that at some point he had been tracked down.  The prosecutor acknowledged that not only had Michael been identified, but he had been a target since 1988.  Although the prosecutor further argued that this fact was made known to the defense before trial, he referred to a page in the record that contains no information about Michael's known relationship to the drug trade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Prosecution's Closing Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background of non-disclosure of not only Michael Mouma's existence but of his known prominence for some four years as a targeted drug trafficker, we examine the prosecution's closing argument.  In so doing, we stress that we specifically put to one side defendant's argument that the government had the duty to follow up with a prompt and energetic investigation on the basis of the information given by her.  How the government chooses to invest its resources is a matter solely of its own concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if the government does find that information given by a defendant proves to be accurate, this is of significance to the defense and its interest in strengthening the defendant's credibility.  In this case the fact that there was indeed a Michael in Aruba with a surname strikingly similar to that reported by defendant would have given some support to defendant's story.  And the fact that this person had long been known as a drug trafficker would have enhanced considerably the believability of defendant's story of being threatened by someone who had the capacity to make good on his threats.  Whether the government's failure to disclose this credibility-strengthening information could be said to be reversible error, we need not decide.  We have no doubt, however, that the prosecutor's persistent theme in closing argument suggesting the nonexistence of this information--and even the opposite of what the government knew--did fatally taint the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor's closing argument began by raising doubts as to defendant's story, referring to Michael in skeptical terms.  The prosecutor noted defendant's plan to go to Aruba, not Mexico, \"to meet with this person she calls Michael.\"   He subsequently made reference to \"this man, whomever he--he is which she calls Michael, [who] was indeed her boyfriend.\"   And he again implicitly questioned Michael's existence when commenting upon her claim that she did not learn of any threat until after she reached Aruba and \"was advised by this alleged Michael that there was a threat against her children.\"   Innuendo then escalated to contradiction.  After challenging defendant's credibility by pointing out how long it had taken for her to tell anyone about Michael's threats against her children, the prosecutor noted, \"One more thing which you need to keep in mind as you listen to defendant's argument and that is whether this Michael in Aruba is really a drug--whether he really exists, whether there really is a drug source besides the defendant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point defense counsel objected.  She argued that, while foreclosed for confidentiality reasons from asking questions about the government's investigation into the information provided by defendant, \"I do not believe that the government should now be able to argue that that information has led to nowhere or that it is meaningless and that something else was the truth.\"   In response, the prosecutor explained that he was pointing to the unlikelihood that \"this guy\" would send defendant to Chicago with no round trip ticket or information about how much money was supposed to be returned to him.  The court allowed the government to argue that it would strain the imagination to accept that \"the guy\" in Aruba entrusted defendant with a quarter million dollars worth of heroin with no instructions concerning how much money she was to bring back.  Not being content with this thrust, the prosecution added a final sally in rebuttal by asserting that defendant's children could not have been in trouble or she would have reacted sooner:  \"[s]he didn't want to stop Michael or whomever his--or whatever his name is.  She wanted to stop us from catching her.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of this was legitimate argument.  The inferences and the direct challenge to the existence of a source named Michael, however, when the prosecution had unearthed evidence that he existed and was a prominent dealer in narcotics, is indefensible.  Here we find a kind of double-acting prosecutorial error:  a failure to communicate salient information, which, under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972), should be disclosed to the defense, and a deliberate insinuation that the truth is to the contrary.  As we pointed out in United States v. Smith, 982 F.2d 681, 683 (1st Cir.1993), \"it [is] not improper to urge the jury to evaluate the plausibility of the justification defense in light of the other evidence (and the lack thereof),\" but \"it is plainly improper for a prosecutor to imply reliance on knowledge or evidence not available to the jury.\"   It is all the more improper to imply reliance on a fact that the prosecutor knows to be untrue, or to question the existence of someone who is known by the prosecution to exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Ingraldi, 793 F.2d 408, 416 (1st Cir.1986), we enunciated the following five-part test:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>In deciding whether a new trial is required--either because prosecutorial misconduct likely affected the trial's outcome or to deter such misconduct in the future--we consider the severity of the misconduct, whether it was deliberate or accidental, the context in which it occurred, the likely curative effect of the judge's admonitions and the strength of the evidence against the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record here presents a strong case against the defendant--overwhelming with respect to her transporting the drugs and substantial in suggesting knowledge that the objects carried were contraband.  Insofar as the evidence of voluntariness or coercion is concerned, everything depended on defendant's credibility.  But that credibility was weakened immeasurably by the absence of evidence that Michael was a targeted drug trafficker and, indeed, by insinuations that no such source even existed.  Conversely, defendant's story would have been dramatically corroborated by the information available to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the other tests tilt strongly in favor of the defense.  The non-disclosure was both severe and deliberate.  It is difficult to accept that the results of such a methodical and painstaking investigation as that described by agent Rolon could have been lost in the shuffle of case preparation.  Even if the failure to inform defendant were not intentional, the carelessness was just as harmful.  The context was such that the most critical factor in defendant's tale of coercion--the coercer--was the casualty of the government's nondisclosure and ill-taken skepticism.  And there was no question about any curative instruction, because the court itself was in ignorance of what the government knew but did not reveal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is regrettable that a case in many respects well and fairly tried and carefully monitored by the court must be undone, the conviction reversed, and a new trial ordered.  But both law and fairness so dictate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The government appeals the sentence imposed, claiming that the court lacked authority to depart downward from the applicable minimum mandatory sentence of 60 months to 41 months in the absence of a prosecution motion requesting such a departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since we conclude that the conviction must be set aside and a new trial granted, we do not reach the government's appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Defendant's Arrest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, 1992, defendant was the last to leave flight 627 after its arrival in San Juan, Puerto Rico, from Aruba.  A customs inspector, having asked for and received defendant's Customs Declaration Card, proceeded with an inspection of defendant's luggage and person.  Although nothing unusual was revealed by the inspection, the inspector became increasingly suspicious because of defendant's nervous demeanor, her statement that she had just returned from visiting her boyfriend (although her passport revealed her married status), her subsequent statement that she did not know the whereabouts of her husband, and her professed ignorance of her ticket's scheduled layover in Chicago.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A computer check revealed no \"intelligence lookouts\" or criminal involvements recorded in defendant's name and a \"pat-down\" authorized by the inspector's supervisor also had negative results.  Then, on suspicion that defendant was an \"internal swallower,\" a customs special agent, Ana Rolon, obtained defendant's consent to an x-ray.  She was then taken to a medical center.  As she disrobed, she was observed putting in her clothing an object which was soon seized by agent Rolon, observed to be a round pellet wrapped in electrical tape inside a condom, then field tested and shown to be heroin.  Meanwhile, x-rays revealed three foreign bodies in defendant's rectum.  Defendant was arrested as soon as the field-test results were known and later expelled the three foreign objects, which proved to be similar pellets of heroin powder.  A fifth pellet was found in the automobile that transported defendant to the medical center.  The total quantity of heroin recovered was 395 grams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Defendant's Duress Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the above scenario suggests, the objective facts concerning defendant's possession and importation were clearly established.  Defendant's defense was that she had been coerced into her role as a courier by the man she had visited in Aruba.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately after her arrest, late on a Friday afternoon, defendant was brought before a U.S. magistrate judge.  When she was told there would be no detention hearing until Monday, she said that Monday would be too late and that she needed to talk with someone right away.  The magistrate judge then undertook to obtain counsel for appellant, and succeeded in reaching Assistant Federal Public Defender Brill, who has represented appellant ever since.  After talking with appellant, Brill told the magistrate judge that the source of the drugs was in Aruba, that their destination was Chicago, and that appellant wanted to cooperate with the government and make a controlled delivery in Chicago on the following day, June 27, since the prospective recipient might still be expecting a phone call from Udechukwu.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In following up on her client's offer, attorney Brill was referred by a customs supervisor to an assistant United States attorney.  The government attorney proved to be unavailable over the weekend, however, and no controlled delivery took place.  On Monday, June 29, appellant was debriefed by agents Rolon and Baez in counsel Brill's presence.  Contemporaneous notes taken by agent Baez were apparently the basis for a \"Report of Investigation\" issued some two months later, on August 25, ten days before the commencement of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the report, appellant told the agents of a long acquaintance with a fellow Nigerian, whose name was then recorded as Michael Mouhma, who had lived with appellant and her family in 1982 for six months.  Michael had returned for a visit in 1988 but, for some untold reason, had his visa canceled in 1992.  Michael recently had called appellant from Aruba, asking her to come and threatening that \"it would only take one call to hurt her and her kids if she did not come....\"  Defendant bought her air ticket, using her Visa card.  In Aruba Michael instructed her to take the contraband to an individual in Chicago who could be reached on a certain beeper number;  he would buy her a return trip ticket and give her the money for Michael.  Michael forced her to carry the contraband in her vagina and rectum, telling her that her husband had been arrested in Mexico in 1989 when carrying drugs from Aruba because he did not follow instructions to carry the contraband internally.  Defendant had given the phone number of Michael's Aruba hotel room to agent Rolon at the time of her arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, defendant expanded on this summary.  She told of her husband's effort in 1989 to assist bringing Nigerians into the United States, which she believed had resulted in his incarceration in Mexico since that time.  In his recent call from Aruba, Michael proposed that she join him in a visit to her husband.  She was afraid to travel alone to Mexico and, after talking with her children, bought a ticket for $1,400.  When she arrived in Aruba, Michael met her, took her to a hotel, took her passport, \"green card,\" and room key, and later told her of a change in plans.  Instead of going immediately to Mexico, she was to carry some packages for him to Chicago.  To ensure her compliance, he threatened that he knew Mafia people and that it would take only a phone call to \"get action.\"   He knew where defendant lived, where she worked, where her children went to school.  She felt she could not escape and the hotel phone did not work.  Michael finally assisted in inserting some of the pellets.  The day after she was apprehended in San Juan, she called a friend in San Diego, told her about Michael's threats, and arranged to have her seven children cared for by the local Nigerian community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>What the Government Knew</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's duress defense was closely tied to her counsel's efforts to obtain evidence from the government that would corroborate her account of what had happened.  In particular, defendant sought corroboration of her identification of Michael as the source of the drugs she had carried.  Although she did not know of the extent of Michael's involvement in drug trafficking until after her trial, she argues that the government knew, before trial, that Michael Mouma (his correct surname) had been a drug trafficker and government target for several years.  Since the issue of government knowledge is critical to this appeal, we summarize the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Before trial.   From the beginning, defense counsel stressed defendant's willingness to cooperate.  On the day of her arrest, June 26, counsel had conveyed defendant's desire to participate in a controlled delivery in Chicago.  At defendant's debriefing on June 29, she gave to the arresting officials the name of her source, which was transcribed as Michael Mouhma.  The agents already had seized a piece of paper with Michael's Aruba hotel room telephone number.  In a letter dated July 2, defense counsel had written the prosecutor of her conversations with defendant, closing with a request to be kept up to date \"as to any further developments.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial was scheduled for September 4.  On August 4, defense counsel moved for the production of any exculpatory and Jencks Act material, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3500;  on August 28, the court granted the requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. At trial.   On September 4, the first day of trial, the prosecution delivered to defendant a \"Report of Investigation\" that had been prepared on August 25.  This report referred to \"an individual later identified as Michael MOUHMA (MICHAEL),\" related defendant's account of her being threatened, but contained no further information about Michael.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon being pressed at trial for what, if anything, the government had learned from information given it by defendant, customs agent Rolon testified:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The name--the name that she gave me was only Michael.  She just gave me and she wrote in the piece of paper what she thought [ ] was his last name.  Okay?  With what she gave me I find nothing, but based on my experience I started digging into and looking for it with what I have, and I started like matching some facts....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have--we started with the information that I received based on all the documents that we find, the numbers, this and that on the--on a person that has been detained.  I keep a copy and start doing some investigation as to who it belongs, et cetera, the subscribe--the telephone subscriber....  It takes time because I depend on different agencies, and some information is--it's protected by the ... privacy act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of defendant's information, agent Rolon said, \"the other name help[ed] in a way to identify that there is another association or organization which involves ... the source ... in Aruba.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Post trial.   After trial, on September 18, defendant moved for the production of any rough notes made by agent Rolon relating to the \"ongoing investigation\" she had alluded to in testimony.  The government's written reply stated that only agent Baez had made notes at the debriefing, which were then submitted, revealing nothing differing in substance from the August 25 report.  The government added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Let the record be clear in that defendant's limited cooperation has NOT resulted in any new investigation.  What little she was willing to offer was relayed by S/A Ana Rolon to an off-district agency which ALREADY had an ongoing investigation into the relevant subject matter at the time defendant was arrested in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Oral argument on appeal.   At oral argument before us, the prosecutor stressed that the cooperation of defendant was limited, that the last name of her source had been misspelled, but that at some point he had been tracked down.  The prosecutor acknowledged that not only had Michael been identified, but he had been a target since 1988.  Although the prosecutor further argued that this fact was made known to the defense before trial, he referred to a page in the record that contains no information about Michael's known relationship to the drug trade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Prosecution's Closing Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background of non-disclosure of not only Michael Mouma's existence but of his known prominence for some four years as a targeted drug trafficker, we examine the prosecution's closing argument.  In so doing, we stress that we specifically put to one side defendant's argument that the government had the duty to follow up with a prompt and energetic investigation on the basis of the information given by her.  How the government chooses to invest its resources is a matter solely of its own concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if the government does find that information given by a defendant proves to be accurate, this is of significance to the defense and its interest in strengthening the defendant's credibility.  In this case the fact that there was indeed a Michael in Aruba with a surname strikingly similar to that reported by defendant would have given some support to defendant's story.  And the fact that this person had long been known as a drug trafficker would have enhanced considerably the believability of defendant's story of being threatened by someone who had the capacity to make good on his threats.  Whether the government's failure to disclose this credibility-strengthening information could be said to be reversible error, we need not decide.  We have no doubt, however, that the prosecutor's persistent theme in closing argument suggesting the nonexistence of this information--and even the opposite of what the government knew--did fatally taint the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor's closing argument began by raising doubts as to defendant's story, referring to Michael in skeptical terms.  The prosecutor noted defendant's plan to go to Aruba, not Mexico, \"to meet with this person she calls Michael.\"   He subsequently made reference to \"this man, whomever he--he is which she calls Michael, [who] was indeed her boyfriend.\"   And he again implicitly questioned Michael's existence when commenting upon her claim that she did not learn of any threat until after she reached Aruba and \"was advised by this alleged Michael that there was a threat against her children.\"   Innuendo then escalated to contradiction.  After challenging defendant's credibility by pointing out how long it had taken for her to tell anyone about Michael's threats against her children, the prosecutor noted, \"One more thing which you need to keep in mind as you listen to defendant's argument and that is whether this Michael in Aruba is really a drug--whether he really exists, whether there really is a drug source besides the defendant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point defense counsel objected.  She argued that, while foreclosed for confidentiality reasons from asking questions about the government's investigation into the information provided by defendant, \"I do not believe that the government should now be able to argue that that information has led to nowhere or that it is meaningless and that something else was the truth.\"   In response, the prosecutor explained that he was pointing to the unlikelihood that \"this guy\" would send defendant to Chicago with no round trip ticket or information about how much money was supposed to be returned to him.  The court allowed the government to argue that it would strain the imagination to accept that \"the guy\" in Aruba entrusted defendant with a quarter million dollars worth of heroin with no instructions concerning how much money she was to bring back.  Not being content with this thrust, the prosecution added a final sally in rebuttal by asserting that defendant's children could not have been in trouble or she would have reacted sooner:  \"[s]he didn't want to stop Michael or whomever his--or whatever his name is.  She wanted to stop us from catching her.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of this was legitimate argument.  The inferences and the direct challenge to the existence of a source named Michael, however, when the prosecution had unearthed evidence that he existed and was a prominent dealer in narcotics, is indefensible.  Here we find a kind of double-acting prosecutorial error:  a failure to communicate salient information, which, under Brady v. Maryland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span> (1972), should be disclosed to the defense, and a deliberate insinuation that the truth is to the contrary.  As we pointed out in United States v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597416\"><a href=\"/opinion/597416/united-states-v-joseph-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span>, 683 (1st Cir.1993), \"it [is] not improper to urge the jury to evaluate the plausibility of the justification defense in light of the other evidence (and the lack thereof),\" but \"it is plainly improper for a prosecutor to imply reliance on knowledge or evidence not available to the jury.\"   It is all the more improper to imply reliance on a fact that the prosecutor knows to be untrue, or to question the existence of someone who is known by the prosecution to exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Ingraldi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471758\"><a href=\"/opinion/471758/united-states-v-peter-f-ingraldi/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span>, 416 (1st Cir.1986), we enunciated the following five-part test:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>In deciding whether a new trial is required--either because prosecutorial misconduct likely affected the trial's outcome or to deter such misconduct in the future--we consider the severity of the misconduct, whether it was deliberate or accidental, the context in which it occurred, the likely curative effect of the judge's admonitions and the strength of the evidence against the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record here presents a strong case against the defendant--overwhelming with respect to her transporting the drugs and substantial in suggesting knowledge that the objects carried were contraband.  Insofar as the evidence of voluntariness or coercion is concerned, everything depended on defendant's credibility.  But that credibility was weakened immeasurably by the absence of evidence that Michael was a targeted drug trafficker and, indeed, by insinuations that no such source even existed.  Conversely, defendant's story would have been dramatically corroborated by the information available to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the other tests tilt strongly in favor of the defense.  The non-disclosure was both severe and deliberate.  It is difficult to accept that the results of such a methodical and painstaking investigation as that described by agent Rolon could have been lost in the shuffle of case preparation.  Even if the failure to inform defendant were not intentional, the carelessness was just as harmful.  The context was such that the most critical factor in defendant's tale of coercion--the coercer--was the casualty of the government's nondisclosure and ill-taken skepticism.  And there was no question about any curative instruction, because the court itself was in ignorance of what the government knew but did not reveal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is regrettable that a case in many respects well and fairly tried and carefully monitored by the court must be undone, the conviction reversed, and a new trial ordered.  But both law and fairness so dictate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
