In  this  appeal we  must\n                                    \n\nresolve a  seemingly irreconcilable  clash between  two statutes.\n\nOne vests the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") with\n\nthe  power to remove \"any action, suit, or proceeding\" to federal\n\ncourt.  12  U.S.C.   1819(b)(2)(B).  The other  commands that the\n\ndistrict court \"shall not\" grant relief in cases involving issues\n\nof state tax  law.   28 U.S.C.    1341.  In  this case, the  FDIC\n\nremoved a Rhode Island tax dispute to the district court, and the\n\ndistrict court remanded the case to the state court under   1341,\n\nfinding that the statute required abstention.  Because we  concur\n\nwith the district court's result, we affirm.\n\n                              FACTS\n                                   \n\n          Appellant bank claimed a refund of $419,025 on its 1987\n\nRhode Island  Bank  Institution Excise  Tax  Return.   The  Rhode\n\nIsland  Tax Division,  however, issued  only a partial  refund of\n\n$285,347.    The  bank filed  an  administrative  appeal for  the\n\nbalance,  but the  partial  refund was  upheld.   The  bank  then\n\nresorted to  the Rhode  Island state  court for  relief, alleging\n\nonly state law grounds for relief. \n\n          In 1991,  while that action  was pending, the  bank was\n\ndeclared insolvent.   The  Comptroller of the  Currency appointed\n\nthe  FDIC  as receiver  and created  a  \"bridge bank\"  to provide\n\ncontinued  service to the  bank's former  customers.   The bridge\n\nbank assumed the tax  refund claim from the insolvent bank.  When\n\nthe  Comptroller later  declared the  bridge bank  insolvent, the\n\nFDIC as  receiver took  possession of the  bridge bank's  assets,\n\n                               -3-\n\nincluding the pending tax refund suit.\n\n          Pursuant  to    1819(b)(2)(B),1  the  FDIC removed  the\n\npending state court suit  to the federal district court  in Rhode\n\nIsland.2   The  state moved  to remand  or dismiss,  arguing that\n\n  1341,  otherwise known as  the Tax Injunction  Act (\"the Act\"),\n\nrequired the federal court to remand the case to the Rhode Island\n\n                    \n\n1  Section 1819(b) provides in relevant part:\n\n            (1)  Status\n\n            The Corporation, in  any capacity,  shall\n            be  an agency  of  the United  States for\n            purposes of  section  1345 of  Title  28,\n            without regard to whether the Corporation\n            commenced the action.\n\n            (2)  Federal court jurisdiction\n\n            (A)  In general\n\n            Except as provided  in subparagraph  (D),\n            all suits of a civil nature at common law\n            or in equity to which the Corporation, in\n            any capacity, is a party shall  be deemed\n            to  arise under  the laws  of the  United\n            States.\n\n            (B)  Removal\n\n            Except as provided  in subparagraph  (D),\n            the  Corporation  may,  without  bond  or\n            security,  remove  any  action, suit,  or\n            proceeding  from  a  State court  to  the\n            appropriate United States district court.\n\nIt is undisputed that subparagraph (D) does not apply here.\n\n2    Apparently  the  FDIC took  this  action  one  day  before a\ndiscovery hearing  and three days before trial.   The case was to\nbe heard  together with  a related case  involving another  Rhode\nIsland bank and the same counsel. \n\n                               -4-\n\nstate court.3     The  FDIC,  in response,  claimed  that it  was\n\nexempt from the operation of the Act under the judicially-created\n\n\"federal instrumentalities\" exception, which establishes that the\n\nAct does  not bar  access to  the  federal courts  by the  United\n\nStates  or its instrumentalities.   A magistrate  agreed that the\n\nFDIC  was  a federal  instrumentality exempt  from  the Act.   On\n\nreview, however, the district court determined  that (1) the FDIC\n\nwas not entitled to  claim the federal instrumentality exemption;\n\n(2)  section 1819  vested the  court with  jurisdiction over  the\n\nmatter; and (3) the Act nonetheless required the court to abstain\n\nfrom deciding  the case.   The district court  therefore remanded\n\nthe  case  to  the Rhode  Island  state  court,  and this  appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                          LEGAL ANALYSIS\n                                        \n\n                                I.\n\n          We   begin   by   addressing   the   district   court's\n\ndetermination that the  Act is an abstention statute,  as opposed\n\nto a jurisdictional statute.  If the district court is correct in\n\nthis ruling, then the apparent conflict between the two  statutes\n\nis  resolved by  the workable  solution that  the district  court\n\nproposed.   Unfortunately,  we  must conclude  that the  district\n\ncourt erred in characterizing the Act as an abstention statute.\n\n          The Supreme Court has instructed us, and  we have held,\n\n                    \n\n3  The Act states that federal courts  \"shall not enjoin, suspend\nor restrain the assessment,  levy or collection of any  tax under\nState law where a  plain, speedy and efficient remedy  may be had\nin the courts of such State.\"  28 U.S.C.   1341.\n\n                               -5-\n\nthat the Act is \"jurisdictional\" in nature, and therefore  serves\n\nto oust the federal  courts of jurisdiction in those  cases which\n\nfall  within its reach.  California v. Grace Brethren Church, 457\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 393,  418-19 (1982)  (because of  Act, \"no federal  district\n\ncourt  had  jurisdiction\");  Trailer  Marine  Transport  Corp. v.\n                                                              \n\nRivera  V zquez,  977  F.2d  1,  4-5  (1st  Cir.  1992)  (Act  is\n               \n\n\"jurisdictional\" and \"not subject to waiver\").\n\n          The  policies behind  the Act  explain  the need  for a\n\nstrong  limitation on  federal jurisdiction  in state  tax cases.\n\nWith  the Act, Congress sought  \"to protect tax  collection as an\n\n'imperative  need' of government.\"  Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d at 5\n                                                  \n\n(quoting  Tully v. Griffin,  Inc., 429 U.S.  68, 73 (1976)).   By\n                                 \n\ndivesting  the federal  courts of jurisdiction,  Congress ensured\n\nagainst  interference \"with so  important a local  concern as the\n\ncollection of state taxes.\"   Grace Brethren Church, 457  U.S. at\n                                                   \n\n408-09 (citing Rosewell v.  LaSalle National Bank, 450  U.S. 503,\n                                                 \n\n522 (1981)).  It  was the paramount importance of  state taxation\n\nto  state  governments  that  led Congress  to  restrict  federal\n\njurisdiction.\n\n          Given this  authority, the district court  was wrong to\n\nabstain.  The distinction  between abstention and jurisdiction is\n\nimportant.   When a court lacks jurisdiction, it has no authority\n\nto grant relief; when a court abstains, it has authority to grant\n\nrelief but does  not exercise it.  The fact  that the Act negates\n\njurisdiction creates  an apparent conflict with  the FDIC removal\n\nstatute, which grants jurisdiction.  \n\n                               -6-\n\n                               II.\n\n          Before  directing our  attention to  this conflict,  we\n\nmust first  determine  whether  the  Act applies  in  this  case.\n\nSpecifically,  we  must address  whether  the FDIC  is  a federal\n\ninstrumentality entitled  to  an exemption  under the  Act.4   On\n\nthis issue, we agree with the district court that the FDIC cannot\n\nescape from  the requirements of the  Act due to its  status as a\n\nfederal agency exempt from state taxation.\n\n          Though  written in  absolute  terms, the  Act does  not\n\napply  to every  state tax  case.   The courts have  recognized a\n\nsignificant  exception,  the  federal instrumentality  exception,\n\nwhich allows the United States and its instrumentalities to bring\n\nsuits  on state tax issues in federal  court in spite of the Act.\n\nDepartment of Employment v. United  States, 385 U.S. 355,  357-58\n                                          \n\n(1966).  The exception arises out of the assumption that Congress\n\nwould not have  denied the federal  government access to  federal\n\ncourts without a clear statement to that effect.  Id.\n                                                     \n\n          Courts  differ on  whether the  FDIC qualifies  for the\n\nexception.  Compare Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. New  York,\n                                                                \n\n928 F.2d 56, 61 (2d Cir. 1991) (FDIC not federal instrumentality)\n\nwith Federal Deposit Insurance  Corp. v.

Intermountain Home\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n4   The parties agree that only  state tax issues are involved in\nthis  case, and do not  seriously argue that  Rhode Island courts\nare inadequate under the  Act.  See Keating v.  Rhode Island, 785\n                                                            \nF. Supp. 1094, 1097 (D. R.I. 1992).\n\n                               -7-\n\nSystems, Inc., 786 F. Supp. 1551 (D. Colo. 1992) (cataloging FDIC\n             \n\nfederal  instrumentality   cases;   holding  FDIC   not   federal\n\ninstrumentality).\n\n          In this circuit, we have outlined no \"bright line\" rule\n\nfor  whether  a  particular  agency  is  entitled  to  claim  the\n\nexception.  Federal Reserve  Bank v. Commissioner of Corporations\n                                                                 \n\nand  Taxation, 499 F.2d 60, 64 (1st  Cir. 1974).  Rather, we have\n             \n\ninstituted a flexible test in which \"each instrumentality must be\n\nexamined  in light  of its  governmental role  and the  wishes of\n\nCongress as expressed  in relevant  legislation.\"  Id.   We  find\n                                                      \n\nthat  this  test  does  not  allow  the  FDIC  to  claim  federal\n\ninstrumentality status.\n\n          The FDIC's  governmental role in this  case is minimal.\n\nRhode  Island taxed a  private bank, not  the federal government.\n\nThe  FDIC  only  became  involved  when  the  bank  was  declared\n\ninsolvent.  As such, no issues  of intergovernmental tax immunity\n\nexist in the case.  Furthermore, if successful, the benefits from\n\nthe refund  claim will flow  principally to the  bank's creditors\n\nand depositors, not to the federal treasury.\n\n          The   relevant  legislation  does   not  indicate  that\n\nCongress  intended  to  accord the  FDIC  federal instrumentality\n\nstatus  for the purposes of the Act.   We note that   1819(b)(1),\n\ntitled \"Status,\"  only  grants the  FDIC  agency status  for  the\n\npurposes of   1345, not for all purposes.  Section 1345, in turn,\n\ncreates \"agency  jurisdiction,\"  a different  statutory grant  of\n\njurisdiction  than the  removal statute  in  question here.   See\n                                                                 \n\n                               -8-\n\nFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. v. Ticktin, 490 U.S. 82,\n                                                   \n\n85-87  (1989) (statutory  grant  of  agency jurisdiction  treated\n\ndifferently   than   grant  of   \"arising   under\"   and  removal\n\njurisdiction).    In  contrast,  the  Federal  Savings  and  Loan\n\nInsurance  Corporation  (\"FSLIC\"),  the  FDIC's  predecessor, was\n\ngranted agency  status for all  purposes, including for  the Act.\n\n12 U.S.C.   1730(k)(1)(A) (repealed 1989). \n\n          It is apparent that Congress knew how to make an agency\n\na federal instrumentality  in the present context.   We therefore\n\nmust assume  that Congress chose not  to do so with  the FDIC, as\n\nthe  pertinent language is missing from the statute.  Because the\n\nFDIC cannot claim to  be a federal instrumentality in  this case,\n\nthe Act applies.\n\n                               III.\n\n          Having  determined   that  the  Act  applies   in  this\n\nsituation,   we  come   to  the   apparent  conflict   between   \n\n1819(b)(2)(B)  and the Act.5   For the  FDIC to prove  that the  \n\n1819(b)(2)(B) removal statute  trumps the Act, it  must show that\n\nCongress  clearly and  manifestly intended the  statute to  be an\n\nexception to the  Act.6   This substantial burden  arises out  of\n\ntwo sources.\n\n                    \n\n5    As stated  previously,    1819(b)(2)(B)  allows the  FDIC to\n\"remove any action, suit, or proceeding,\" while the Act  commands\nthat the  district court \"shall not\" adjudicate state tax issues.\nSee supra notes 1 and 3 for the full text of these statutes. \n         \n\n6   Alternatively  it must show  that the  Rhode Island  does not\nprovide a \"plain, speedy and efficient remedy,\" as required under\n  1341.  See supra note 4.\n                  \n\n                               -9-\n\n          First, in Franchise Tax  Board v.

The  party  claiming  federal  court\n\njurisdiction  can show  that the  state remedy  is not  speedy or\n\nefficient, or the  party can show  that the jurisdiction  statute\n\nwas intended to be an exception to the Act.   While the Court did\n\nnot  resolve this  issue in  the case,  id. at  20 n.21,  and its\n                                           \n\nstatements were therefore dicta,  we find its approach persuasive\n\nin light of the strong policy embodied by the Act.\n\n          Second, the  Court's statements in  Franchise Tax Board\n                                                                 \n\nare   consistent  with   the  well-settled  canon   of  statutory\n\ninterpretation   disfavoring   the   repeal  of   a   statute  by\n\nimplication, especially  if that statute is  a long-standing one.\n\nAndrus v.

As  has  been\n                   \n\nfrequently stated, there are \n\n            two well-settled categories of repeals by\n            implication  --  (1) where  provisions in\n            the  two  acts   are  in   irreconcilable\n            conflict . . .; and (2) if the  later act\n            covers the whole  subject of the  earlier\n            one   and  is   clearly  intended   as  a\n            substitute . . . .  But,  in either case,\n            the  intention  of  the   legislature  to\n            repeal must be clear and manifest . . . .\n\nUnited States v. Commonwealth  of Puerto Rico, 721 F.2d  832, 836\n                                             \n\n(1st  Cir. 1983) (citations omitted).  The FDIC, as a consequence\n\n                               -10-\n\nof this canon and  the Franchise Tax  Board case, must show  that\n                                           \n\nCongress  clearly   and  manifestly  intended  to   override  the\n\nprovisions of the Act by passing the FDIC removal statute.  \n\n          We turn first to the language of the removal statute to\n\ndetermine   what  Congress   intended.     The  mere   fact  that\n\n  1819(b)(2)(B)  states that  the FDIC  may remove  \"all\" actions\n\ndoes not in itself  demonstrate the clear and manifest  intent of\n\nCongress to  trump the  Act.   See Moe  v. Confederated  Salish &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nKootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U.S. 463, 472 (1976)\n                                       \n\n(conflict between Indian tribe removal statute and Tax Injunction\n\nAct).   Such language, rather, is consistent with a general grant\n\nof jurisdiction which did not take into account the provisions of\n\nthe Act.  Id.\n             \n\n          The structure of   1819(b) does not demonstrate a clear\n\nand  manifest intent  to override  the Act.   This lack  of clear\n\nintent is underscored  by the contrast  between the FDIC  removal\n\nstatute, and  the removal statute applicable  to its predecessor,\n\nthe FSLIC.  The FSLIC statute began by stating \"[n]otwithstanding\n\nany other provision of law . . .,\" manifesting a  clear intent to\n\noverride any conflicting statutes in existence.  The FDIC statute\n\ncontains no such clause.  As  we stated above, it is obvious that\n\nCongress knew how to  exempt the FSLIC from the operation  of the\n\nAct when it so desired.   The absence of similar language  in the\n\nrevisited statute indicates to us that Congress did not intend to\n\noverride the Act. \n\n          Congress has  limited the FDIC's  jurisdiction in other\n\n                               -11-\n\nways.   Agency jurisdiction,  pursuant  to    1345, is  expressly\n\nsubject  to the  provisions of  \"other law.\"   Assuming  that the\n\nfederal instrumentality exception to the Act does not  apply, the\n\nAct would be such  \"other law\" limiting the FDIC's  access to the\n\nfederal  courts.    The structure  of     1819(b)  thus does  not\n\ndemonstrate a clear and manifest intent to override the Act.\n\n          We turn now to  the legislative history of  the removal\n\nstatute  for whatever light  it may shed  on the issue.   In this\n\nregard, the parties  have directed us  to, and we have  found, no\n\nreference in the relevant legislative history on how the  removal\n\nstatute affects the  operation of the Act.   Indeed, there is  no\n\nreference  to the Act in  the extensive history  of the Financial\n\nInstitutions  Reform and  Recovery Act  (\"FIRREA\"), of  which the\n\nremoval statute forms a part.\n\n          In support  of its position that  Congress intended the\n\nremoval statute as  an exception to the Act, the  FDIC directs us\n\nto portions of  the legislative history stating that  the statute\n\nexpanded the scope of federal jurisdiction for the FDIC.  Indeed,\n\nwe  have already  acknowledged this  purpose in  another context.\n\nCapizzi,  937 F.2d  8, 10-11  (1st Cir.  1991) (FIRREA  \"expanded\n       \n\nfederal jurisdiction\"  beyond previous  removal provision).   The\n\nfact  of expansion begs the  question, however, of  what, if any,\n\nlimits  on federal  jurisdiction exist.   We  must find  that the\n\nexpansion  specifically  reverses   the  prohibition  on  federal\n\njurisdiction mandated  by  the Act  for  the FDIC  to win.    The\n\nabsence of such concrete evidence, however, convinces us that the\n\n                               -12-\n\nremoval statute does not trump the Act.\n\n          Given the uncertainties we  have found in the language,\n\nstructure and  legislative history of    1819(b),  we cannot  say\n\nthat  the statute  clearly and  manifestly evinces  an  intent to\n\ntrump the  Act.  We  thus construe    1819(b) as  subject to  the\n\nlimitation on federal jurisdiction  in the Act.  As  the district\n\ncourt  was correct in determining that this case belongs in state\n\ncourt, we affirm.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -13-\n",

In  this  appeal we  must\n                                    \n\nresolve a  seemingly irreconcilable  clash between  two statutes.\n\nOne vests the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") with\n\nthe  power to remove \"any action, suit, or proceeding\" to federal\n\ncourt.  12  U.S.C.   1819(b)(2)(B).  The other  commands that the\n\ndistrict court \"shall not\" grant relief in cases involving issues\n\nof state tax  law.   28 U.S.C.    1341.  In  this case, the  FDIC\n\nremoved a Rhode Island tax dispute to the district court, and the\n\ndistrict court remanded the case to the state court under   1341,\n\nfinding that the statute required abstention.  Because we  concur\n\nwith the district court's result, we affirm.\n\n                              FACTS\n                                   \n\n          Appellant bank claimed a refund of $419,025 on its 1987\n\nRhode Island  Bank  Institution Excise  Tax  Return.   The  Rhode\n\nIsland  Tax Division,  however, issued  only a partial  refund of\n\n$285,347.    The  bank filed  an  administrative  appeal for  the\n\nbalance,  but the  partial  refund was  upheld.   The  bank  then\n\nresorted to  the Rhode  Island state  court for  relief, alleging\n\nonly state law grounds for relief. \n\n          In 1991,  while that action  was pending, the  bank was\n\ndeclared insolvent.   The  Comptroller of the  Currency appointed\n\nthe  FDIC  as receiver  and created  a  \"bridge bank\"  to provide\n\ncontinued  service to the  bank's former  customers.   The bridge\n\nbank assumed the tax  refund claim from the insolvent bank.  When\n\nthe  Comptroller later  declared the  bridge bank  insolvent, the\n\nFDIC as  receiver took  possession of the  bridge bank's  assets,\n\n                               -3-\n\nincluding the pending tax refund suit.\n\n          Pursuant  to    1819(b)(2)(B),1  the  FDIC removed  the\n\npending state court suit  to the federal district court  in Rhode\n\nIsland.2   The  state moved  to remand  or dismiss,  arguing that\n\n  1341,  otherwise known as  the Tax Injunction  Act (\"the Act\"),\n\nrequired the federal court to remand the case to the Rhode Island\n\n                    \n\n1  Section 1819(b) provides in relevant part:\n\n            (1)  Status\n\n            The Corporation, in  any capacity,  shall\n            be  an agency  of  the United  States for\n            purposes of  section  1345 of  Title  28,\n            without regard to whether the Corporation\n            commenced the action.\n\n            (2)  Federal court jurisdiction\n\n            (A)  In general\n\n            Except as provided  in subparagraph  (D),\n            all suits of a civil nature at common law\n            or in equity to which the Corporation, in\n            any capacity, is a party shall  be deemed\n            to  arise under  the laws  of the  United\n            States.\n\n            (B)  Removal\n\n            Except as provided  in subparagraph  (D),\n            the  Corporation  may,  without  bond  or\n            security,  remove  any  action, suit,  or\n            proceeding  from  a  State court  to  the\n            appropriate United States district court.\n\nIt is undisputed that subparagraph (D) does not apply here.\n\n2    Apparently  the  FDIC took  this  action  one  day  before a\ndiscovery hearing  and three days before trial.   The case was to\nbe heard  together with  a related case  involving another  Rhode\nIsland bank and the same counsel. \n\n                               -4-\n\nstate court.3     The  FDIC,  in response,  claimed  that it  was\n\nexempt from the operation of the Act under the judicially-created\n\n\"federal instrumentalities\" exception, which establishes that the\n\nAct does  not bar  access to  the  federal courts  by the  United\n\nStates  or its instrumentalities.   A magistrate  agreed that the\n\nFDIC  was  a federal  instrumentality exempt  from  the Act.   On\n\nreview, however, the district court determined  that (1) the FDIC\n\nwas not entitled to  claim the federal instrumentality exemption;\n\n(2)  section 1819  vested the  court with  jurisdiction over  the\n\nmatter; and (3) the Act nonetheless required the court to abstain\n\nfrom deciding  the case.   The district court  therefore remanded\n\nthe  case  to  the Rhode  Island  state  court,  and this  appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                          LEGAL ANALYSIS\n                                        \n\n                                I.\n\n          We   begin   by   addressing   the   district   court's\n\ndetermination that the  Act is an abstention statute,  as opposed\n\nto a jurisdictional statute.  If the district court is correct in\n\nthis ruling, then the apparent conflict between the two  statutes\n\nis  resolved by  the workable  solution that  the district  court\n\nproposed.   Unfortunately,  we  must conclude  that the  district\n\ncourt erred in characterizing the Act as an abstention statute.\n\n          The Supreme Court has instructed us, and  we have held,\n\n                    \n\n3  The Act states that federal courts  \"shall not enjoin, suspend\nor restrain the assessment,  levy or collection of any  tax under\nState law where a  plain, speedy and efficient remedy  may be had\nin the courts of such State.\"  28 U.S.C.   1341.\n\n                               -5-\n\nthat the Act is \"jurisdictional\" in nature, and therefore  serves\n\nto oust the federal  courts of jurisdiction in those  cases which\n\nfall  within its reach.

The distinction  between abstention and jurisdiction is\n\nimportant.   When a court lacks jurisdiction, it has no authority\n\nto grant relief; when a court abstains, it has authority to grant\n\nrelief but does  not exercise it.  The fact  that the Act negates\n\njurisdiction creates  an apparent conflict with  the FDIC removal\n\nstatute, which grants jurisdiction.  \n\n                               -6-\n\n                               II.\n\n          Before  directing our  attention to  this conflict,  we\n\nmust first  determine  whether  the  Act applies  in  this  case.\n\nSpecifically,  we  must address  whether  the FDIC  is  a federal\n\ninstrumentality entitled  to  an exemption  under the  Act.4   On\n\nthis issue, we agree with the district court that the FDIC cannot\n\nescape from  the requirements of the  Act due to its  status as a\n\nfederal agency exempt from state taxation.\n\n          Though  written in  absolute  terms, the  Act does  not\n\napply  to every  state tax  case.

The  mere   fact  that\n\n  1819(b)(2)(B)  states that  the FDIC  may remove  \"all\" actions\n\ndoes not in itself  demonstrate the clear and manifest  intent of\n\nCongress to  trump the  Act.

Such language, rather, is consistent with a general grant\n\nof jurisdiction which did not take into account the provisions of\n\nthe Act.  Id.\n             \n\n          The structure of   1819(b) does not demonstrate a clear\n\nand  manifest intent  to override  the Act.   This lack  of clear\n\nintent is underscored  by the contrast  between the FDIC  removal\n\nstatute, and  the removal statute applicable  to its predecessor,\n\nthe FSLIC.  The FSLIC statute began by stating \"[n]otwithstanding\n\nany other provision of law . . .,\" manifesting a  clear intent to\n\noverride any conflicting statutes in existence.  The FDIC statute\n\ncontains no such clause.  As  we stated above, it is obvious that\n\nCongress knew how to  exempt the FSLIC from the operation  of the\n\nAct when it so desired.   The absence of similar language  in the\n\nrevisited statute indicates to us that Congress did not intend to\n\noverride the Act. \n\n          Congress has  limited the FDIC's  jurisdiction in other\n\n                               -11-\n\nways.   Agency jurisdiction,  pursuant  to    1345, is  expressly\n\nsubject  to the  provisions of  \"other law.\"   Assuming  that the\n\nfederal instrumentality exception to the Act does not  apply, the\n\nAct would be such  \"other law\" limiting the FDIC's  access to the\n\nfederal  courts.    The structure  of     1819(b)  thus does  not\n\ndemonstrate a clear and manifest intent to override the Act.\n\n          We turn now to  the legislative history of  the removal\n\nstatute  for whatever light  it may shed  on the issue.   In this\n\nregard, the parties  have directed us  to, and we have  found, no\n\nreference in the relevant legislative history on how the  removal\n\nstatute affects the  operation of the Act.   Indeed, there is  no\n\nreference  to the Act in  the extensive history  of the Financial\n\nInstitutions  Reform and  Recovery Act  (\"FIRREA\"), of  which the\n\nremoval statute forms a part.\n\n          In support  of its position that  Congress intended the\n\nremoval statute as  an exception to the Act, the  FDIC directs us\n\nto portions of  the legislative history stating that  the statute\n\nexpanded the scope of federal jurisdiction for the FDIC.  Indeed,\n\nwe  have already  acknowledged this  purpose in  another context.\n\nCapizzi,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563788\"><a href=\"/opinion/563788/michael-j-capizzi-v-federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10-11  (1st Cir.  1991) (FIRREA  \"expanded\n       \n\nfederal jurisdiction\"  beyond previous  removal provision).   The\n\nfact  of expansion begs the  question, however, of  what, if any,\n\nlimits  on federal  jurisdiction exist.   We  must find  that the\n\nexpansion  specifically  reverses   the  prohibition  on  federal\n\njurisdiction mandated  by  the Act  for  the FDIC  to win.    The\n\nabsence of such concrete evidence, however, convinces us that the\n\n                               -12-\n\nremoval statute does not trump the Act.\n\n          Given the uncertainties we  have found in the language,\n\nstructure and  legislative history of    1819(b),  we cannot  say\n\nthat  the statute  clearly and  manifestly evinces  an  intent to\n\ntrump the  Act.  We  thus construe    1819(b) as  subject to  the\n\nlimitation on federal jurisdiction  in the Act.
