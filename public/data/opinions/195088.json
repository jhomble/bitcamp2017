Concluding,  as  we  do, that\n          SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\n                                \n\nseveral  courts of  appeals  have  read  the  supervised  release\n\nrevocation  provision (SRR  provision),  18  U.S.C.    3583(e)(3)\n\n(1988 &amp;  Supp. III 1991), in too crabbed  a manner, we hold today\n\nthat  this statute  permits a  district court, in  resentencing a\n\nperson who  has violated  the conditions of  his or  her original\n\nterm of  supervised release, to  impose a new term  of supervised\n\nrelease in conjunction with an additional prison term, subject to\n\ncertain restrictions limned  in the statute  itself.  Because  we\n\nare staking out a position at variance with the majority view, we\n\nwrite at some length to explain our rationale.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND OF THE CASE\n\n          After having broken into a post office  and stolen mail\n\nin  violation  of  18 U.S.C.      1708,  2115  (1988), defendant-\n\nappellant Shaun K. O'Neil pleaded guilty to a class D felony.  On\n\nNovember 9,  1990,  the district  court  sentenced him  to  serve\n\ntwenty-one months in prison (the  top of the applicable guideline\n\nsentencing  range), followed by three years of supervised release\n\n(the maximum allowed by statute).  We affirmed the sentence.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v. O'Neil, 936 F.2d 599 (1st Cir. 1991).  \n                       \n\n          Soon after his release from the penitentiary, appellant\n\ncommitted  several  significant   violations  of  the  supervised\n\nrelease conditions,  e.g., stealing a firearm  while intoxicated.\n                         \n\nDubbing appellant a  \"walking juvenile crime  wave\" who posed  \"a\n\nserious danger  to the  public,\" the district  judge revoked  the\n\noriginal term of supervised release and sentenced appellant to an\n\n                                2\n\nadditional twenty-four months in prison,  to be followed by a new\n\nthree-year  supervised release term.  O'Neil appeals, asking that\n\nwe  vacate  his  sentence  and  remand  for  resentencing.    His\n\nprincipal  allegation  is  that  the reimposition  of  supervised\n\nrelease exceeds the district court's statutory authority.\n\nII.  THE STATUTE\n\n          Passed as part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 18\n\nU.S.C.    3551-3559, 3561-3566, 3571-3574, 3581-3586, &amp; 28 U.S.C.\n\n    991-98 (1988  &amp; Supps.),  the  supervised release  alteration\n\nstatute, 18  U.S.C.   3583(e),  of which  the SRR provision  is a\n\npart, authorizes a court to alter a term of supervised release in\n\na number of ways.  A court may:\n\n          (1)  terminate a  term of  supervised release\n          and discharge the person released at any time\n          after   the  expiration   of   one  year   of\n          supervised release . . . ;\n\n          (2)  extend a term  of supervised  release if\n          less  than the  maximum  authorized term  was\n          previously imposed,  and may  modify, reduce,\n          or  enlarge  the   conditions  of  supervised\n          release,  at any time prior to the expiration\n          or  termination  of  the  term of  supervised\n          release . . . ;\n\n          (3) revoke a term  of supervised release, and\n                                                       \n          require  the person to serve in prison all or\n                                                       \n          part  of  the   term  of  supervised  release\n                                                       \n          without credit for time  previously served on\n          postrelease  supervision, if  it  finds by  a\n          preponderance of the evidence that the person\n          violated a  condition of  supervised release,\n          pursuant  to the  provisions  of the  Federal\n          Rules   of   Criminal  Procedure   that   are\n          applicable to probation revocation and to the\n          provisions  of  applicable  policy statements\n          issued by  the Sentencing  Commission, except\n          that  a person  whose term  is  revoked under\n          this  paragraph may not  be required to serve\n          more  that 3 years  in prison if  the offense\n\n                                3\n\n          for  which  the  person was  convicted  was a\n          Class  B  felony,  or more  than  2  years in\n          prison  if the  offense  was a  Class C  or D\n          felony; or\n\n          (4) order the  person to remain at  his place\n          of residence during nonworking hours . . . . \n\n18 U.S.C.   3583(e) (emphasis supplied).  The present controversy\n\ncenters on the third of these four options.\n\n          The alteration  statute empowers a  resentencing court,\n\nin certain circumstances,  to elongate a previously  imposed term\n\nof  supervised  release, 18  U.S.C.    3583(e)(2),  or,  in other\n\ncircumstances, to  revoke supervision and impose  imprisonment in\n\nlieu  of supervision, id. at    3583(e)(3).  What is unclear, and\n                         \n\nwhat  has confounded  the  courts,  is  whether  an  intermediate\n\nresentencing option  exists:  Does  the statute allow a  court to\n\nrevoke  supervision and,  in effect, restructure  the defendant's\n\nsentence by imposing  a combination of imprisonment  plus further\n\nsupervision?\n\n          Although this court has never addressed the question, a\n\nminimum of  six circuits have  read the statute to  foreclose the\n\nreimposition of a term of supervised release following revocation\n\nand  imprisonment.  See United  States v. Truss,  4 F.3d 437, 438\n                                               \n\n(6th Cir.  1993); United  States v. McGee,  981 F.2d  271, 274-76\n                                         \n\n(7th Cir. 1992);  United States v.

Behnezhad, 907 F.2d 896, 898-99\n                                           \n\n(9th Cir.  1990); see  also United  States v.  Gozlon-Peretz, 894\n                                                            \n\n                                4\n\nF.2d 1402,  1405 n.5  (dictum), amended, 910  F.2d 1152  (3d Cir.\n                                       \n\n1990), aff'd  on other grounds, 498  U.S. 395 (1991).   The Tenth\n                              \n\nCircuit  came to the  same conclusion belatedly,  after reversing\n\nits field.   See United States v.  Rockwell, 984 F.2d  1112, 1117\n                                           \n\n(10th Cir.)  (overruling United States  v. Boling, 947  F.2d 1461\n                                                 \n\n(10th  Cir. 1991)), cert.  denied, 113 S.  Ct. 2945 (1993).   The\n                                 \n\nEleventh Circuit  has sent  mixed signals.   In United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nTatum,  998 F.2d 893,  894-95 (11th Cir. 1993) (per curiam),  the\n     \n\ncourt  embraced the  majority view.   A  second panel,  two weeks\n\nlater, bowed to  Tatum on stare decisis grounds; but,  in a sharp\n                                       \n\ndeparture  from  customary practice,  all three  judges expressed\n\ntheir profound  disagreement with  Tatum's holding.   See  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Williams, 2 F.3d 363, 365 (11th Cir. 1993).  Thus, nine\n                  \n\ncircuits in all  read the SRR  provision narrowly.  On  the other\n\nside of the  ledger, the Eighth Circuit  stands as a waif  in the\n\nwilderness.  See United States  v. Schrader, 973 F.2d 623, 624-25\n                                           \n\n(8th  Cir. 1992)  (holding that  section  3583(e)(3) permits  the\n\nreimposition of a term of supervised release following revocation\n\nand imprisonment);  see also United  States v. Levi, 2  F.3d 842,\n                                                   \n\n846 (8th Cir. 1993) (reaffirming Schrader).\n                                         \n\n          We  are called  upon  today  to add  our  voice to  the\n\nchorus.  We  approach this task mindful that,  while the decision\n\nto revoke a term  of supervised release is ordinarily  reviewable\n\nfor abuse of  discretion, the quintessentially legal  question of\n\nwhether  a  post-revocation  sentence  exceeds  statutory  limits\n\nnecessitates plenary  review .   See Rockwell, 984 F.2d  at 1114;\n                                             \n\n                                5\n\nsee also United  States v. St. Cyr,  977 F.2d 698, 701  (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1992) (holding  that interpretive questions under  the sentencing\n\nguidelines should be reviewed de novo).\n                                     \n\nIII.  THE COMPETING INTERPRETATIONS\n\n          We start our quest by elucidating the two ways in which\n\nthe SRR provision may be read as a coherent command.\n\n                               A   \n                               A\n\n          To  achieve the  result  reached  by  the  majority  of\n\ncourts, the  assiduous reader  must proceed  along the  following\n\nlines.  First, read the word \"revoke\" restrictively, i.e., in the\n                                                         \n\nsense of  \"cancel\" or \"annul,\"  so that it does  not allow either\n\nthe recommencing of the previously imposed term of supervision or\n\nthe commencement  of a  new term of  supervision.   Next, suppose\n\nthat the word  \"term\", when used for  the second time in  the SRR\n\nprovision, does not  imply that there is a term of supervision in\n\nexistence,  but merely  serves to  set  a temporal  limit on  the\n\nprison sentence that may be imposed following revocation; or, put\n\nanother way, that the second use of the word \"term\" is to be read\n\nas if it were shorthand for a more verbose phrase like  \"the time\n\nperiod equivalent  to what would  have been the  term.\"  Only  if\n\nthese interpretive steps  are taken does  it become clear,  under\n\nthe SRR provision, that a  court may absolutely extinguish a term\n\nof supervised  release and impose  a new prison term,  subject to\n\ncertain statutory limitations,1  but, withal, may not  impose any\n\n                    \n\n     1On  the majority's reading, the  statutory limit in a given\ncase  is the  lesser of (i)  the length  of the original  term of\nsupervision, or (ii) the numerical limit designated  by the final\n\n                                6\n\nother or further supervision term.\n\n                                B\n\n          The  other  possible  parsing   of  the  SRR  provision\n\nproceeds  in  three  phases.     At  the  outset,  consider   the\n\npossibility  that the  word \"revoke\"  means simply to  \"recall.\" \n\nSee, e.g., Black's Law  Dictionary 1322 (6th ed.  1990) (defining\n                                  \n\n\"revoke\" as \"[t]o annul  or make void by recalling or taking back\n\n. . . .\").  If \"revoke\" is read in this way, the SRR provision is\n\nnot inconsistent  with the recommencement of  supervised release.\n\nNext, from  the fact that the  SRR provision mentions a  \"term of\n\nsupervised release\"  in that portion  of the  text following  the\n\nconferral of the power to  revoke, the reader plausibly can infer\n\nthat  the supervision  term recommenced  upon  revocation    else\n\nthere  would be  no  term  then in  existence.   Finally,  having\n\nposited   that  the   supervision  term   is   alive  and   well,\n\nnotwithstanding the court's  order of revocation, the  reader can\n\nconclude  that, in  authorizing the  court  to send  a person  to\n\nprison after revocation for  \"all or part of  the term,\" the  SRR\n\nprovision contemplates that  any remaining part of  the original,\n                                          \n\nrecalled term will  be devoted to supervision.   On this reading,\n\nthe  SRR  provision  allows  a  court to  call  back  a  term  of\n\nsupervised release, recommence the term,  convert all or part  of\n\n                    \n\nclause of  the SRR  provision vis-a-vis  each specified  class of\noffense.\n\n                                7\n\nit into  jail time (up to  the statutory limit),2  and retain any\n\nremainder as a period of non-detentive monitoring. \n\n          Before  leaving these  competing versions,  we wish  to\n\nmake two preliminary points.  First, we do not regard the initial\n\nstep  in these  analyses to  be  indispensable.   See infra  Part\n                                                           \n\nIV(A).    Second, each  of  the competing  versions  requires the\n\nreader to make a leap of faith beyond the four corners of the SRR\n\nprovision  itself.   In this  sense, then,  the playing  field is\n\nlevel.\n\nIV.  CHOOSING AN INTERPRETATION\n\n          We turn to the difficult choice between these meanings,\n\nusing the  full panoply of available aids to the  construction of\n\nlegislative enactments.\n\n                                A\n\n          In   approaching  statutory   interpretation,  \"it   is\n\naxiomatic that the plain words  and structure of the statute must\n\nbe paramount.\"   United States v. Aversa, 984  F.2d 493, 498 (1st\n                                        \n\n                    \n\n     2On  this  reading  of  the SRR  provision,  there  are  two\noperative limits in  any given case.  First,  the combined length\nof   all    post-revocation   impositions    (incarcerative   and\nsupervisory) may  not exceed the  length of the original  term of\nsupervision.   Second,  the incarcerative  portion  of the  post-\nrevocation sentence may not exceed the numerical limit designated\nby  the SRR provision's final clause  for the class of offense in\nquestion.  It will be noted that, on this reading, the concluding\nclause of  the SRR  provision places an  absolute ceiling  on the\ntime a person may  serve in prison following revocation of a term\nof  supervised  release  and thereby  ensures  that  the criminal\njustice system cannot trap an offender in its  web forever.  This\npoint adequately answers those who assert that construing the SRR\nprovision  broadly sets  the stage  for a  never-ending  cycle of\nrevocation,  resentencing   to  prison   plus  supervision,   and\nrevocation again, see McGee, 981 F.2d at 275.\n                           \n\n                                8\n\nCir. 1993) (en banc).  Most of the courts that have  read section\n\n3583(e) to foreclose the imposition of a post-revocation  term of\n\nsupervised  release  have done  so  under  the  banner  of  plain\n\nmeaning.   Those courts read  the word \"revoke\" as  signifying an\n\nextinguishment so uncompromising as to preclude a post-revocation\n\nterm of supervision.  See, e.g., McGee, 981 F.2d at 274; Koehler,\n                                                                \n\n973 F.2d at  134-35; Holmes,  954 F.2d at  272.  This  inflexible\n                           \n\ninsistence upon a particular  version of lexicographic  orthodoxy\n\nseemingly overlooks  that \"the  plain-meaning doctrine  is not  a\n\npedagogical absolute.\"  Greenwood Trust Co. v. Massachusetts, 971\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  818, 825  (1st  Cir. 1992),  cert. denied,  113 S.  Ct. 974\n                                               \n\n(1993).   In  particular, \"[t]erms  in an  act whose  meaning may\n\nappear plain  outside the  scheme of  the statute  can take  on a\n\ndifferent  meaning  when  read in  their  proper  context.\"   Id.\n                                                                 \n\n(citing various Supreme Court precedents).\n\n          The  Williams court  found \"revoke\"  plain enough,  but\n                       \n\nread it differently.  It suggested that \"revoke\" could be read in\n\nthe  alternative sense of \"call back.\"   Williams, 2 F.3d at 365.\n                                                 \n\nThis sense  is best illustrated  by the poet William  Cowper, who\n\nwrote:\n\n          How readily we wish time spent revok'd,\n\n          That we might try the ground again. . . . \n\nThe Task,  Book VI,  l.25 (1784);  see also supra  p. 7  (quoting\n                                                 \n\nBlack's  Law  Dictionary).   While  we  regard  this approach  as\n\nplausible,  we   do  not   see  why  even   the  most   inelastic\n\ninterpretation of \"revoke\"  would frustrate a reading  of the SRR\n\n                                9\n\nprovision  that permits imposition  of a post-revocation  term of\n\nsupervision.    If  a  term  has been  called  back,  it  may  be\n\nreimposed.  If a term has been absolutely terminated, a  new term\n                                                            \n\nstill may be imposed    in the same  way that, once a  license is\n\nrevoked, a  new one  may be  issued.   In the  end, the  semantic\n\ndebate over the  word \"revoke\" turns out  to be no more  than the\n\nswapping  of heuristics.  No matter how  the word is defined, the\n\nlanguage of the SRR provision  is consistent with the possibility\n\nthat  a post-revocation  term  of  supervision  lawfully  may  be\n\nimposed.\n\n          We  believe  this linguistic  intuition is  verified by\n\nhistorical  precedents.    Previous  Congresses  used   the  word\n\n\"revoke\"  in  crafting  the  statutory  forerunners  of   section\n\n3583(e)(3).   See, e.g., 18  U.S.C.   4214 (1988)  (repealed 1984\n                       \n\nanent offenses committed  after November 1, 1987)  (revocation of\n\nparole); 21 U.S.C.A.   841(c) (1981 &amp; Supp. 1993) (repealed 1984)\n\n(revocation of special parole); 18 U.S.C.   3653 (1988) (repealed\n\n1984 anent offenses committed after November 1, 1987) (revocation\n\nof  probation).   Notwithstanding  Congress's  use  of  the  word\n\n\"revoke,\" it was widely thought  that reimposition of a period of\n\nnon-detentive monitoring,  to commence  following post-revocation\n\nimprisonment, was permitted  under all three of  these antecedent\n\nstatutory provisions.  See infra Part IV(D).\n                                \n\n                                B\n\n          Our structural analysis of the  alteration statute and,\n\nparticularly,  of the SRR  provision starts with  the recognition\n\n                                10\n\nthat  the  first  appellate court  to  interpret  section 3583(e)\n\nrested its holding  on the notion that the  alteration statute is\n\nstructured as  a set  of discrete options  separated by  the word\n\n\"or.\"   Given  the shape  of the  statute, the court  reasoned, a\n\njudge  may either  \"extend\" the  term under subsection  (e)(2) or\n\n\"revoke\"  it  under  subsection  (e)(3),  but   not  both.    See\n                                                                 \n\nBehnezhad, 907 F.2d  at 898-99.  Subsequent courts  quickly moved\n         \n\nbeyond this  restrictive rationale,  realizing that it  collapses\n\ninto  the debate  over  the  meaning of  the  SRR provision  and,\n\ntherefore, proves  nothing.  See,  e.g., McGee, 981 F.2d  at 274;\n                                              \n\nHolmes, 954 F.2d at 272.\n      \n\n          To the extent  that the repeated use of the disjunctive\n\nin section  3583(e)  sheds any  light  on Congress's  intent,  we\n\nbelieve that it favors a broad reading of the SRR provision.  The\n\nfirst principal option that the alteration  statute presents to a\n\ndistrict  judge is  to \"terminate\"  the  supervised release  term\n\npreviously imposed under subsection (e)(1).  If Congress meant to\n\n\"revoke\" supervised  release in  the hard sense  of the  word, it\n\ncould simply  have used  the same language  twice.   Most likely,\n\nthen, to  \"revoke\" as used  in the SRR provision  means something\n\nother than to \"terminate\".\n\n                                C\n\n          Two  general  principles  of  statutory  interpretation\n\ninform  our  conclusion that  the  SRR provision  cannot  be read\n\ngrudgingly:   the  principle that  the grant  of a  greater power\n\nnecessarily  includes the  grant of  a lesser  power, unless  the\n\n                                11\n\nauthority to exercise  a lesser power is  expressly reserved; and\n\nthe  principle  that  statutes  should  not  be  read to  produce\n\nillogical results.\n\n          1.   The Greater  Includes the  Lesser.   The principle\n          1.   The Greater  Includes the  Lesser.\n                                                \n\nthat the grant  of a greater power includes the grant of a lesser\n\npower is  a  bit of  common  sense that  has  been recognized  in\n\nvirtually every  legal code from  time immemorial.  It  has found\n\nmodern expression primarily  in the realm of  constitutional law.\n\nSee, e.g., City  of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer  Publishing Co., 486\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  750, 763  (1988)  (commenting that  the  power to  prohibit\n\nspeech entirely  includes the lesser  power to license it  at the\n\ngovernment's  discretion);  Posadas  de  Puerto  Rico Assocs.  v.\n                                                             \n\nTourism Co., 478 U.S. 328, 345  (1986) (holding that the power to\n           \n\nban  casino  gambling  includes  the  lesser  power  to  prohibit\n\nadvertising of casino gambling).\n\n          While  this principle has nested less frequently in the\n\ncriminal law context, it is fully applicable in that milieu.   To\n\nillustrate,  we  use  an  example  that  bears  a  strong  family\n\nresemblance  to the  problem  at hand.    The federal  sentencing\n\nguidelines originally  stated  that  \"an  extraordinary  physical\n\nimpairment  may be  a  reason  to impose  a  sentence other  than\n\nimprisonment.\"  U.S.S.G.  5H1.4, p.s. (Nov. 1990).   Three courts\n\nof  appeals, including  this  one,  refused  to  understand  this\n\nprovision to require an all-or-nothing choice between imposing an\n\nincarcerative  sentence within the guideline range or imposing no\n\nprison  sentence.     The  courts  reasoned  that,   despite  the\n\n                                12\n\nunvarnished  language of the provision, the greater departure (no\n\nincarceration)  necessarily  included  the  lesser  departure  (a\n\nprison  sentence below  the bottom  of  the guideline  sentencing\n\nrange).  See United States v. Slater, 971 F.2d 626, 635 (7th Cir.\n                                    \n\n1992);  United States  v. Hilton,  946  F.2d 955,  958 (1st  Cir.\n                                \n\n1991);  United States  v. Ghannam,  899 F.2d  327, 329  (4th Cir.\n                                 \n\n1990).3\n\n          Similarly, in this  case, we are reluctant  to posit an\n\nall-or-nothing   choice   between  continuing   a   defendant  on\n\nsupervised   release   (with   no  further   incarceration)   and\n\nimprisoning  the defendant  (with no  further  supervision).   We\n\nagree with the Eighth Circuit  that if the SRR provision  gives a\n\ndistrict court the  power to sentence an offender to  a full term\n\nof  imprisonment upon revocation, it must necessarily confer upon\n\nthe  court \"the  power under  that  subsection to  impose a  less\n\ndrastic sanction.\"  Schrader, 973 F.2d at 625.\n                            \n\n          2.

See\n                                                                 \n\nKelly v. United States, 924 F.2d 355, 361 (1st Cir. 1991); United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.  Meyer, 808 F.2d  912, 919 (1st Cir.  1987); Sutherland\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     3This   intuition  was   vindicated  by  Congress   and  the\nSentencing  Commission  when,  effective  November 1,  1991,  the\nphrase  \"other than imprisonment\" was  changed to read \"below the\napplicable guideline  range.\"   See U.S.S.G.  App. C,  Amend. 386\n                                   \n(Nov. 1991).\n\n                                13\n\nStat. Const.   45.12 (5th ed.).  This principle goes back  to the\n            \n\nearly days of  the Republic.  See M'Culloch v.  Maryland, 17 U.S.\n                                                        \n\n(4 Wheat.) 316, 355 (1819). \n\n          In this case, the sentencing  rule that emerges from  a\n\nnarrow reading of section 3583(e)(3) is surpassingly difficult to\n\ndefend  from a policy  perspective.  It  is hard to  conceive any\n\nlogical   reason  why  Congress  might  authorize  sentencing  an\n\noffender to a non-mandatory term of imprisonment, variable in the\n\njudge's  discretion,  upon  revocation of  a  term  of supervised\n\nrelease,  but would,  at  the same  time,  withhold authority  to\n\nimpose  a sentence  of  equivalent  duration  upon  more  lenient\n\nconditions.  See Williams, 2  F.3d at 365; Schrader, 973  F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n625.  Although we could jury-rig a  legislative justification for\n\nso cramped an  interpretation of the  law, we think  it is  self-\n\nevident that barring judges from reimposing supervision following\n\nrevocation  needlessly inhibits  the  court's sentencing  options\n\nwhile at the same time failing to advance any of the  fundamental\n\ngoals of criminal sentencing.4   As a matter of policy, then, the\n\nimplications for sentencing  inherent in a stingy  reading of the\n\nSRR provision  go a long  way toward convincing us  that Congress\n\ncould not have favored (or intended to compel) such a reading.  \n\n                                D\n\n          As  a rule, courts should resort to legislative history\n\n                    \n\n     4The  fundamental goals  of the  Sentencing  Reform Act  are\ncommonly   thought   to    include   uniformity,   honesty,   and\nproportionality.  See  United States v.  Williams, 891 F.2d  962,\n                                                 \n963-64  (1st Cir.  1989); see  also U.S.S.G.

See, e.g., United States v. Charles\n                                                                 \n\nGeorge Trucking Co.,  823 F.2d 685, 688 (1st Cir. 1987); Barry v.\n                                                              \n\nSt. Paul  Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

Though  we believe that a  generous\n     \n\nreading  of section 3583(e)(3) best comports with plain language,\n\nstatutory structure, logic,  and sound policy, we  are aware that\n\nambiguity is commonly thought to exist when statutory language is\n\nsusceptible    to   differing,    but   nonetheless    plausible,\n\nconstructions. See United States v. R.L.C., 112 S. Ct. 1329, 1334\n                                          \n\n(1992);  cf. Allen  v. Adage, Inc.,  967 F.2d 695,  700 (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1992)  (explaining  when  ambiguity  exists  in  the  text  of  a\n\ncontract).    Here,  as the  weight  of  authority unquestionably\n\nattests, there is  room for disagreement over the  meaning of the\n\nSRR provision.  Therefore, we continue our inquiry.\n\n          Where  ambiguity  lurks,  the burial  ground  in  which\n\nsuperseded statutes  rest sometimes  proves a  fertile field  for\n\nassistance in determining the meaning  of existing statutes.  See\n                                                                 \n\nDwight v.

We think that superseded  statutes are of\n            \n\nparticular value in construing  provisions within the  Sentencing\n\nReform Act.  We have  recognized   and we believe  the Sentencing\n\nCommission  has recognized    the desirability of  emulating pre-\n\nguidelines practice  to the  extent that plain  meaning does  not\n\ncompel  change.    Thus,  we have  repeatedly  referred  to  pre-\n\n                                15\n\nguidelines precedent  as an  aid to  interpreting the  sentencing\n\nguidelines.  See, e.g., United States v. Emery, 991 F.2d 907, 911\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Blanco, 888 F.2d 907,  910 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1989); see also U.S.S.G.   1A3, (Nov. 1992) (stating  policy\n                    \n\nthat \"the  guidelines represent an approach that begins with, and\n\nbuilds  upon,\" pre-guidelines  practice).   We  believe the  same\n\nprinciple applies in construing the Sentencing Reform Act itself.\n\n          To  place   the  genealogy  of  supervised  release  in\n\nhistorical context,  one must first recognize  that non-detentive\n\nmonitoring developed  along two  separate lines:   probation  and\n\nparole.     The  Sentencing   Reform  Act,  and   the  guidelines\n\nimplementing  it, swept aside both of these modalities, replacing\n\nprobation with an entirely new creature bearing the same name and\n\nreplacing parole (as well as its interim variant, special parole)\n\nwith supervised release.  See Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  395, 400 (1991)  (noting that Congress  intended to replace\n\nmost forms of  parole, including special parole,  with supervised\n\nrelease).5  We think  it is of critical importance that, prior to\n\n                    \n\n     5The transition  from special  parole to  supervised release\nwas grotesquely complicated.   Most existing provisions  for non-\ndetentive monitoring  were  repealed  in  1984  as  part  of  the\nSentencing Reform Act,  but the repeal did not  take effect until\nNovember  1, 1987.   However,  the special  parole provision,  21\nU.S.C.   841(b)(1)(A), was repealed outright.  Thus, from October\n12, 1984 through October 27, 1986, neither special parole nor any\nsubstitute for it was in force.  Apparently desiring to eliminate\nthis  hiatus, Congress  amended  the  law  to  insert  supervised\nrelease in lieu  of special parole for the  interval from October\n27, 1986 to November 1, 1987.  Congress accomplished this feat by\namending 21 U.S.C.   841(b) (under which no provision is made for\nrevocation).   Subsequent to November 1, 1987, supervised release\nhas been  controlled by the  provisions of the  Sentencing Reform\nAct.

Probation.\n                        \n\ntoday  closely  tracks  an  earlier  debate  over post-revocation\n\nprobation.  The relevant pre-guidelines statute empowered a court\n\nto  \"revoke  probation,  and  impose  any  sentence  which  might\n\noriginally  have been  imposed.\"  18  U.S.C.    3653 (repealed).6\n\nUnder  this law,  five circuits  viewed  probation as  a kind  of\n\n\"sentence\" that could  be imposed after revocation  of probation.\n\nSee Banks v.

Instead,  the debate hinged on the  word \"sentence\"  \nspecifically, on whether  probation could be conceived  as a kind\nof \"sentence.\"\n\n                                17\n\n89  (E.D.N.C. 1972).   When  the  smoke cleared,  \"the weight  of\n\nauthority heavily  favor[ed] the conclusion that  reimposition of\n\nprobation is permissible  upon revocation of probation.\"   United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.  Urdaneta,  771  F.  Supp.  28,   32  (E.D.N.Y.  1991)\n                    \n\n(canvassing pre-guidelines case law).\n\n          Under the  new sentencing regime,  the statute treating\n\nwith  post-revocation probation deals much more directly with the\n\nvexed question of  reimposition.  It empowers a  court to \"revoke\n\nthe sentence of probation and  impose any other sentence that was\n                                                        \n\navailable at  the time of the  initial sentencing.\"  18  U.S.C.  \n\n3565(a) (1988) (emphasis supplied).  Although the question is not\n\nbefore us, and  we, accordingly, do not rule  definitively on it,\n\nit  seems  probable   that  Congress  intended  to   depart  from\n\nprevailing  pre-guidelines practice  and  forbid reimposition  of\n\nprobation following the  revocation  of a term of probation.7  We\n\ndraw this  inference from the  insertion of the word  \"other,\" on\n\nthe theory that  a change in statutory language  should be \"read,\n\nif  possible, to have some effect.\"   American Nat'l Red Cross v.\n                                                              \n\nS.G., 112 S. Ct. 2465, 2475 (1992).  It thus appears quite likely\n    \n\nthat  the  drafters  of  section  3565 were  aware  of  the  pre-\n\nguidelines case law  and knew how to  design a statute in  such a\n\n                    \n\n     7Even  if  Congress  intended to  preclude  reimposition  of\nprobation  following  revocation  of a  term  of  probation, that\nintention has no implications for supervised  release.  Under the\nSentencing Reform  Act, a  term of probation  may not  be imposed\nwhen a  defendant is sentenced to imprisonment.   See 18 U.S.C.  \n                                                     \n3553(a)(3).  Since a \"combined\" sentence is prohibited ab initio,\n                                                                \nit would make little sense to allow a combined form of sentencing\nupon revocation of probation.\n\n                                18\n\nway as to address its impact head-on.\n\n          2.   Parole.   There was never  any question  that non-\n          2.   Parole.\n                     \n\ndetentive  monitoring could follow  a prison sentence  imposed in\n\nconsequence  of the  revocation of  a term  of parole  or special\n\nparole.  See,  e.g., 28 C.F.R.    2.52  app. (1993) (setting  out\n                   \n\nUnited  States Parole Commission's policy statement to the effect\n\nthat \"an adequate period of renewed supervision following release\n\nfrom  reimprisonment  or  reinstatement to  supervision,  must be\n\navailable\");  id.  at      2.57  (making  the   policy  statement\n                 \n\napplicable to special  parole); see also Bentsen  v. Ralston, 658\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 639, 640  (8th Cir. 1981) (citing cases  for the proposition\n\nthat an erstwhile parolee serving post-revocation prison time may\n\nearn good-time credit applicable to  a second parole period).  In\n\nthis context, the  Senate report that accompanied  the Sentencing\n\nReform  Act  demonstrates  Congress's   awareness  of  the   pre-\n\nguidelines practice:\n\n          Under  [pre-guidelines]  law,  if  a  parolee\n          violates a  condition of parole  that results\n          in  a  determination  to  revoke parole,  the\n          revocation has  the effect  of requiring  the\n          parolee  to   serve  the  remainder   of  his\n          original  term  of imprisonment,  subject  to\n                                                       \n          periodic  consideration  for   re-release  as\n                                                   \n          required for any prisoner who is eligible for\n          parole.\n\nS.  Rep.  No.  225,  98th  Cong.  2d  Sess.,  reprinted  in  1984\n                                                           \n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3306 (emphasis supplied).\n\n          We  find this  historical phenomenon  to be  especially\n\nsignificant in light  of the wording of the  provision pertaining\n\nto  the revocation  of  special parole.    The governing  statute\n\n                                19\n\ndecreed  that \"[a]  person  whose special  parole  term has  been\n\nrevoked may be  required to serve all or part of the remainder of\n\nthe new term of imprisonment.\"   21 U.S.C.A.   841(c) (repealed).\n\nNotwithstanding that in section 841(c), as in section 3583(e)(3),\n\nthere  was no  explicit authorization  to commence a  second non-\n\ndetentive  term, the Parole Commission, whose interpretation of a\n\nprovision  it is charged  to execute is  entitled to considerable\n\nweight, see  Chevron U.S.A.,  Inc. v.  Natural Resources  Defense\n                                                                 \n\nCouncil, Inc., 467  U.S. 837, 844-45 (1984),  explicitly endorsed\n             \n\nthe reimposition of special parole.  \n\n          Given the obvious similarities in language,  structure,\n\nand substance between  section 841(c) and section  3583(e)(3), we\n\nare fortified in our conclusion that section 3583(e)(3) plausibly\n\nmay   bear  a  broader  interpretation  than  it  heretofore  has\n\nreceived.  Moreover,  it seems  highly likely  that Congress,  in\n\nreplacing a repealed provision with a new provision of hauntingly\n\nsimilar wording, intended that the pre-guidelines  interpretation\n\nwould  continue to  apply.    Otherwise,  Congress  would  almost\n\ncertainly have altered the language to clarify its intent   as it\n\ndid in connection with probation, see supra Part IV(D)(1).\n                                           \n\n          For these reasons,  the historical development  of non-\n\ndetentive  monitoring, in  all its  permutations,  reinforces our\n\nintuition that  Congress meant  to leave  undisturbed the  widely\n\naccepted  pre-guidelines  practice  of  allowing district  courts\n\ndiscretion to  order a  period of non-detentive  monitoring as  a\n\npart of the sentence imposed  for violation of supervised release\n\n                                20\n\nconditions.\n\n                                E\n\n          Studying what has transpired  in Congress subsequent to\n\nthe passage of  the alteration statute produces  another possible\n\naid to statutory construction.  The focus here is on a bipartisan\n\nquartet   comprising four senior members  of the Senate Judiciary\n\nCommittee     thought to  have been supremely influential  in the\n\npassage  of  the  Sentencing  Reform  Act:    Senators  Thurmond,\n\nKennedy, Biden,  and Hatch.    These senators  uniformly favor  a\n\nclarifying amendment  that would  remove any  doubt that  section\n\n3583(e)(3) allows reimposition of supervised release.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\n137 Cong. Rec. S10021 (daily  ed. July 15, 1991) (text  of S.188,\n\nsponsored by Sens.

March  17, 1993)  (Sen. Hatch  added as  cosponsor to\n\nS.468).8\n\n          We understand that  such thirteenth-hour pronouncements\n\nare of uncertain value.  Though courts may  accord some weight to\n\na subsequent enactment that reflects directly on a  statute under\n\nscrutiny, see, e.g.,  Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v.  FCC, 395 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n367,  380-81  (1969),  pronouncements  made  in  the  legislative\n\nhistory  of  that  subsequent statute  frequently  are  viewed as\n\n                    \n\n     8For what,  if any, relevance  it may  have, the  Sentencing\nCommission  also favors  a clarifying  amendment.   See  U.S.S.G.\n                                                       \n 7B1.3(g)(2)  (Nov. 1992)  (policy statement  reading  statute to\nallow reimposition of supervision); id. at  7B1.3, comment.

Ct. 1919, 1927 n.4 (1991).  Accordingly, we\n             \n\nreach  our decision today  without placing significant  weight on\n\npost-enactment materials.\n\n          Nonetheless,  courts, including  the Supreme  Court and\n\nthis court, have occasionally thought post-enactment declarations\n\nof congressional  intent possessed  some probative  value.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Seatrain Shipbuilding Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 444 U.S. 572,\n                                                  \n\n596  (1980), (relying  in  part on  committee report  relative to\n\nsubsequently enacted amendment); United States v.

We believe  that if\n\npost-enactment history,  short of  the actual  passage  of a  new\n\nbill, is ever  to be given  weight, this case  is a nearly  ideal\n\ncandidate.  The  sponsors of the proposed amendments  include the\n\nsame  senators who sponsored the enacted statute;9 the emendatory\n\nlegislation has been characterized by a sponsor as \"clarif[ying]\"\n\nin nature, rather than as revisory or augmentative, see 139 Cong.\n                                                       \n\nRec.

Senator  Kennedy submitted a freestanding  sentencing bill,\ncontaining nearly identical provisions, at approximately the same\ntime.  See Kate Stith &amp; Steve  Y. Koh, The Politics of Sentencing\n                                                                 \nReform:   The  Legislative  History  of  the  Federal  Sentencing\n                                                                 \nGuidelines, 28 Wake Forest L.Rev. 223, 261 (1993).\n          \n\n                                22\n\nincarnations, the  clarification has  been adopted  twice by  the\n\nHouse and four times by the Senate (including twice by the Senate\n\nin the form of a freestanding bill).  See 139 Cong. Rec. at S2150\n                                         \n\n(citing   bills).    This  history  strongly  suggests  that  the\n\namendment  remains  unpassed  only because  the  vagaries  of the\n\nparliamentary process are  what they are.  When,  as now, the two\n\nhouses of Congress, in the wake of a series of judicial decisions\n\ngoing mainly in one direction,  have repeatedly signified that an\n\namendment is needed  to clarify recently enacted  legislation, it\n\nseems reasonable  to infer that  the courts have failed  to grasp\n\nthe enacting Congress's intent.  In such circumstances,  the case\n\nfor giving some modest weight to post-enactment history peaks.\n\n                                F\n\n          At   this  point,  we  have  marshalled  the  available\n\ndata.10  We have found neither  of the contending readings to  be\n\nobviously correct on  the statute's face, and we  have deterrated\n\nno  direct evidence of congressional intent sufficient to capture\n\nthe flag.  In the  end, however, three considerations persuade us\n\nthat a broader interpretation of the SRR provision is more likely\n\n                    \n\n     10In the  process, we have  considered   and rejected    the\nnotion  that  the rule  of  lenity, a  background  principle that\nproperly comes into play when, at the  end of a thorough inquiry,\nthe meaning of a criminal  statute remains obscure, see  Chapman,\n                                                                \n111  S.  Ct.  at  1926,  might  be  of  help  here  in discerning\ncongressional  intent.    See, e.g.,  Koehler,  923  F.2d  at 135\n                                             \n(arguing  that  the rule  of lenity  cuts  in favor  of  a narrow\nconstruction  of  the  SRR  provision).    The  problem  lies  in\ndetermining whose ox may be gored.  Depending on the facts of any\nparticular defendant's situation,  a generous reading of  the SRR\nprovision can produce  either a harsher or a  more lenient result\nthan  a  cramped reading  will  produce.    Thus, we  regard  the\ninterpretive struggle over the SRR provision as lenity-neutral.\n\n                                23\n\nwhat  Congress   intended.     First,  a   narrow  rendering   is\n\ninharmonious with  the statute as  a whole.  Second,  in choosing\n\nbetween  two  plausible  readings,  we  hesitate  to  select  the\n\nalternative that in effect imputes to Congress a policy for which\n\nno  compelling rationale  can  be postulated  (and  that, in  the\n\nbargain, blindly treats a greater power as if it did not  include\n\na  lesser  power).     Third,  given  a  statute   of  protracted\n\nindeterminacy, we are  inclined to favor the  interpretation that\n\npromotes continuity  with traditional  sentencing practice    all\n\nthe  more  so  since  the   preexisting  practice  was  based  in\n\nsignificant  part upon  a  similarly worded  statute.   For these\n\nreasons, and despite our abiding respect for the courts that have\n\ngone the  other way, we hold that the  district judge did not err\n\nin concluding that he possessed the power to impose both a prison\n\nterm and a  term of  supervised release  following revocation  of\n\nappellant's original supervision term.\n\nV. APPLYING THE SRR PROVISION\n\n          Having  determined  that   the  court  below  correctly\n\ngrasped  the essential  meaning  of the  SRR provision,  we find,\n\nnonetheless,  that it  erred in fashioning  appellant's sentence.\n\nIn this case, upon revocation  of the original term of supervised\n\nrelease, the  SRR provision yields  a maximum sentence  length of\n\nthree years.  See 18 U.S.C.   3583(e)(3).  No more than two years\n                 \n\n                                24\n\nof that  period can be devoted to incarceration.11   See id.  The\n                                                            \n\nkey to  these computations  is that the  combined limit  of three\n\nyears matches the length of  the original term of supervision and\n\nthe  secondary limitation    two  years in  prison    matches the\n\nstatutory maximum allowable for revocation of  supervised release\n\nwhen the underlying offense  is a Class  D felony.   See id.   In\n                                                            \n\nlight of  these  benchmarks, it  is  apparent that  the  sentence\n\nimposed here  exceeded the  maximum sentence  authorized by  law.\n\nSpecifically,  upon   revocation  of   supervised  release,   the\n\nimposition of a  two-year prison term followed by  a fresh three-\n\nyear supervision term is unlawful.\n\n          Although O'Neil's sentence must be vacated, at least in\n\npart,  the contours of  the appropriate remedy  remain tenebrous.\n\nOn one hand, the government tells us that we should in effect lop\n\n                    \n\n     11We  are  aware  that the  Sentencing  Commission's  policy\nstatement contemplates that  the new term of imprisonment will be\n\"less  than\"  the  maximum term  of  imprisonment  imposable upon\nrevocation for each class of offense, U.S.S.G.  7B1.3(g)(2) p.s.,\nbut  we use  round  numbers  for  simplicity's sake.    Moreover,\nalthough a policy statement ordinarily \"is an authoritative guide\nto the meaning  of the applicable guideline,\"  Williams v. United\n                                                                 \nStates, 112  S. Ct. 1112,  1119 (1992), the policy  statements of\n      \nChapter 7 are unaccompanied by  guidelines, and are prefaced by a\nspecial discussion  making manifest  their tentative  nature, see\n                                                                 \nU.S.S.G. Ch.7,  Pt.A, intro. comment.   Hence, we today  join six\nother  circuits in  recognizing Chapter  7  policy statements  as\nadvisory rather than mandatory.   See United States v.  Thompson,\n                                                                \n976 F.2d 1380, 1381 (11th  Cir. 1992); United States v.

Blackston,  940 F.2d 877,\n                                                 \n893 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 611 (1991); United States\n                                                                 \nv.  Oliver, 931 F.2d  463, 465 (8th  Cir. 1991).   On remand, the\n          \nlower  court must consider, but  need not necessarily follow, the\nSentencing Commission's recommendations regarding post-revocation\nsentencing. \n\n                                25\n\noff the last two years of the supervision term, thus bringing the\n\nsentence into statutory alignment.  On the other  hand, appellant\n\nurges  us   to  vacate   the  whole   sentence  and  remand   for\n\nresentencing,  thus permitting the district court, armed with our\n\ninsights into the  workings of the SRR provision,  to rethink its\n\noptions.    While   there  is   precedent  for   each  of   these\n\nalternatives, compare, e.g.,  United States v. Vasquez,  504 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n555, 556 (5th Cir. 1974) (per curiam) (holding that the excessive\n\nportion  of a  sentence may  be  trimmed and  the remainder  left\n\nintact) with, e.g., United States v. Berkowitz, 429 F.2d 921, 928\n                                              \n\n(1st  Cir.  1970)  (vacating entire  sentence  and  remanding for\n\nresentencing), we believe that the latter option is preferable in\n\nthis case.  We explain briefly.\n\n          Although   subject   to   constitutional   constraints,\n\nstatutory limitations, and, now,  the guidelines, sentencing  is,\n\nby  and  large,  within  the  province  of  the  district  court.\n\nSentences  usually  contain  a variety  of  components,  e.g., an\n                                                             \n\nincarcerative component,  a monetary  component (say,  a fine  or\n\ncost-of-confinement  order),  and a  non-detentive,  non-monetary\n\ncomponent  (say, supervised  release).   These  components  often\n\ninterrelate.   Where  an appellate  court unties  the  bundle and\n\ndecides that one component must  be reconfigured, it may often be\n\nbetter practice  to enlist  the district  court  to retrofit  the\n\npackage.  So  it is here.  We think that  the district court, not\n\nthis court, is  best equipped to gauge what  the overall sentence\n\nshould be.  See generally  United States v. Pimienta-Redondo, 874\n                                                            \n\n                                26\n\nF.2d  9, 14  (1st  Cir.) (en  banc)  (discussing resentencing  in\n\nmultiple-count case after determination  that the Double Jeopardy\n\nClause  barred  imposition of  separate  sentence on  one  of two\n\ncounts of conviction), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 890 (1989).\n                                   \n\nVI   CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go no further.  We hold that the SRR provision,\n\n18 U.S.C.   3583(e)(3), permits a district court, upon revocation\n\nof a term of supervised release, to impose a prison sentence or a\n\nsentence  combining   incarceration  with   a  further   term  of\n\nsupervised release, so  long as (1) the  incarcerative portion of\n\nthe sentence does not exceed the time limit specified  in the SRR\n\nprovision itself, and  (2) the combined length of  the new prison\n\nsentence cum supervision term does not exceed the duration of the\n            \n\noriginal term  of supervised release.   Since the  district court\n\noverstepped these  boundaries, we vacate appellant's sentence and\n\nremand for resentencing.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n                \n\n                                27\n",

Concluding,  as  we  do, that\n          SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\n                                \n\nseveral  courts of  appeals  have  read  the  supervised  release\n\nrevocation  provision (SRR  provision),  18  U.S.C.    3583(e)(3)\n\n(1988 &amp;  Supp. III 1991), in too crabbed  a manner, we hold today\n\nthat  this statute  permits a  district court, in  resentencing a\n\nperson who  has violated  the conditions of  his or  her original\n\nterm of  supervised release, to  impose a new term  of supervised\n\nrelease in conjunction with an additional prison term, subject to\n\ncertain restrictions limned  in the statute  itself.  Because  we\n\nare staking out a position at variance with the majority view, we\n\nwrite at some length to explain our rationale.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND OF THE CASE\n\n          After having broken into a post office  and stolen mail\n\nin  violation  of  18 U.S.C.      1708,  2115  (1988), defendant-\n\nappellant Shaun K. O'Neil pleaded guilty to a class D felony.  On\n\nNovember 9,  1990,  the district  court  sentenced him  to  serve\n\ntwenty-one months in prison (the  top of the applicable guideline\n\nsentencing  range), followed by three years of supervised release\n\n(the maximum allowed by statute).  We affirmed the sentence.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v. O'Neil, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563643\"><a href=\"/opinion/563643/united-states-v-shaun-k-oneil/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1991).  \n                       \n\n          Soon after his release from the penitentiary, appellant\n\ncommitted  several  significant   violations  of  the  supervised\n\nrelease conditions,  e.g., stealing a firearm  while intoxicated.\n                         \n\nDubbing appellant a  \"walking juvenile crime  wave\" who posed  \"a\n\nserious danger  to the  public,\" the district  judge revoked  the\n\noriginal term of supervised release and sentenced appellant to an\n\n                                2\n\nadditional twenty-four months in prison,  to be followed by a new\n\nthree-year  supervised release term.  O'Neil appeals, asking that\n\nwe  vacate  his  sentence  and  remand  for  resentencing.    His\n\nprincipal  allegation  is  that  the reimposition  of  supervised\n\nrelease exceeds the district court's statutory authority.\n\nII.  THE STATUTE\n\n          Passed as part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 18\n\nU.S.C.    3551-3559, 3561-3566, 3571-3574, 3581-3586, &amp; 28 U.S.C.\n\n    991-98 (1988  &amp; Supps.),  the  supervised release  alteration\n\nstatute, 18  U.S.C.   3583(e),  of which  the SRR provision  is a\n\npart, authorizes a court to alter a term of supervised release in\n\na number of ways.  A court may:\n\n          (1)  terminate a  term of  supervised release\n          and discharge the person released at any time\n          after   the  expiration   of   one  year   of\n          supervised release . . . ;\n\n          (2)  extend a term  of supervised  release if\n          less  than the  maximum  authorized term  was\n          previously imposed,  and may  modify, reduce,\n          or  enlarge  the   conditions  of  supervised\n          release,  at any time prior to the expiration\n          or  termination  of  the  term of  supervised\n          release . . . ;\n\n          (3) revoke a term  of supervised release, and\n                                                       \n          require  the person to serve in prison all or\n                                                       \n          part  of  the   term  of  supervised  release\n                                                       \n          without credit for time  previously served on\n          postrelease  supervision, if  it  finds by  a\n          preponderance of the evidence that the person\n          violated a  condition of  supervised release,\n          pursuant  to the  provisions  of the  Federal\n          Rules   of   Criminal  Procedure   that   are\n          applicable to probation revocation and to the\n          provisions  of  applicable  policy statements\n          issued by  the Sentencing  Commission, except\n          that  a person  whose term  is  revoked under\n          this  paragraph may not  be required to serve\n          more  that 3 years  in prison if  the offense\n\n                                3\n\n          for  which  the  person was  convicted  was a\n          Class  B  felony,  or more  than  2  years in\n          prison  if the  offense  was a  Class C  or D\n          felony; or\n\n          (4) order the  person to remain at  his place\n          of residence during nonworking hours . . . . \n\n18 U.S.C.   3583(e) (emphasis supplied).  The present controversy\n\ncenters on the third of these four options.\n\n          The alteration  statute empowers a  resentencing court,\n\nin certain circumstances,  to elongate a previously  imposed term\n\nof  supervised  release, 18  U.S.C.    3583(e)(2),  or,  in other\n\ncircumstances, to  revoke supervision and impose  imprisonment in\n\nlieu  of supervision, id. at    3583(e)(3).  What is unclear, and\n                         \n\nwhat  has confounded  the  courts,  is  whether  an  intermediate\n\nresentencing option  exists:  Does  the statute allow a  court to\n\nrevoke  supervision and,  in effect, restructure  the defendant's\n\nsentence by imposing  a combination of imprisonment  plus further\n\nsupervision?\n\n          Although this court has never addressed the question, a\n\nminimum of  six circuits have  read the statute to  foreclose the\n\nreimposition of a term of supervised release following revocation\n\nand  imprisonment.

THE COMPETING INTERPRETATIONS\n\n          We start our quest by elucidating the two ways in which\n\nthe SRR provision may be read as a coherent command.\n\n                               A   \n                               A\n\n          To  achieve the  result  reached  by  the  majority  of\n\ncourts, the  assiduous reader  must proceed  along the  following\n\nlines.  First, read the word \"revoke\" restrictively, i.e., in the\n                                                         \n\nsense of  \"cancel\" or \"annul,\"  so that it does  not allow either\n\nthe recommencing of the previously imposed term of supervision or\n\nthe commencement  of a  new term of  supervision.   Next, suppose\n\nthat the word  \"term\", when used for  the second time in  the SRR\n\nprovision, does not  imply that there is a term of supervision in\n\nexistence,  but merely  serves to  set  a temporal  limit on  the\n\nprison sentence that may be imposed following revocation; or, put\n\nanother way, that the second use of the word \"term\" is to be read\n\nas if it were shorthand for a more verbose phrase like  \"the time\n\nperiod equivalent  to what would  have been the  term.\"  Only  if\n\nthese interpretive steps  are taken does  it become clear,  under\n\nthe SRR provision, that a  court may absolutely extinguish a term\n\nof supervised  release and impose  a new prison term,  subject to\n\ncertain statutory limitations,1  but, withal, may not  impose any\n\n                    \n\n     1On  the majority's reading, the  statutory limit in a given\ncase  is the  lesser of (i)  the length  of the original  term of\nsupervision, or (ii) the numerical limit designated  by the final\n\n                                6\n\nother or further supervision term.\n\n                                B\n\n          The  other  possible  parsing   of  the  SRR  provision\n\nproceeds  in  three  phases.     At  the  outset,  consider   the\n\npossibility  that the  word \"revoke\"  means simply to  \"recall.\" \n\nSee, e.g., Black's Law  Dictionary 1322 (6th ed.  1990) (defining\n                                  \n\n\"revoke\" as \"[t]o annul  or make void by recalling or taking back\n\n. . . .\").  If \"revoke\" is read in this way, the SRR provision is\n\nnot inconsistent  with the recommencement of  supervised release.\n\nNext, from  the fact that the  SRR provision mentions a  \"term of\n\nsupervised release\"  in that portion  of the  text following  the\n\nconferral of the power to  revoke, the reader plausibly can infer\n\nthat  the supervision  term recommenced  upon  revocation    else\n\nthere  would be  no  term  then in  existence.   Finally,  having\n\nposited   that  the   supervision  term   is   alive  and   well,\n\nnotwithstanding the court's  order of revocation, the  reader can\n\nconclude  that, in  authorizing the  court  to send  a person  to\n\nprison after revocation for  \"all or part of  the term,\" the  SRR\n\nprovision contemplates that  any remaining part of  the original,\n                                          \n\nrecalled term will  be devoted to supervision.   On this reading,\n\nthe  SRR  provision  allows  a  court to  call  back  a  term  of\n\nsupervised release, recommence the term,  convert all or part  of\n\n                    \n\nclause of  the SRR  provision vis-a-vis  each specified  class of\noffense.\n\n                                7\n\nit into  jail time (up to  the statutory limit),2  and retain any\n\nremainder as a period of non-detentive monitoring. \n\n          Before  leaving these  competing versions,  we wish  to\n\nmake two preliminary points.  First, we do not regard the initial\n\nstep  in these  analyses to  be  indispensable.   See infra  Part\n                                                           \n\nIV(A).    Second, each  of  the competing  versions  requires the\n\nreader to make a leap of faith beyond the four corners of the SRR\n\nprovision  itself.   In this  sense, then,  the playing  field is\n\nlevel.\n\nIV.  CHOOSING AN INTERPRETATION\n\n          We turn to the difficult choice between these meanings,\n\nusing the  full panoply of available aids to the  construction of\n\nlegislative enactments.\n\n                                A\n\n          In   approaching  statutory   interpretation,  \"it   is\n\naxiomatic that the plain words  and structure of the statute must\n\nbe paramount.\"   United States v. Aversa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599121\"><a href=\"/opinion/599121/united-states-v-daniel-f-aversa-united-states-of-america-v-vincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 498 (1st\n                                        \n\n                    \n\n     2On  this  reading  of  the SRR  provision,  there  are  two\noperative limits in  any given case.  First,  the combined length\nof   all    post-revocation   impositions    (incarcerative   and\nsupervisory) may  not exceed the  length of the original  term of\nsupervision.   Second,  the incarcerative  portion  of the  post-\nrevocation sentence may not exceed the numerical limit designated\nby  the SRR provision's final clause  for the class of offense in\nquestion.  It will be noted that, on this reading, the concluding\nclause of  the SRR  provision places an  absolute ceiling  on the\ntime a person may  serve in prison following revocation of a term\nof  supervised  release  and thereby  ensures  that  the criminal\njustice system cannot trap an offender in its  web forever.  This\npoint adequately answers those who assert that construing the SRR\nprovision  broadly sets  the stage  for a  never-ending  cycle of\nrevocation,  resentencing   to  prison   plus  supervision,   and\nrevocation again, see McGee, 981 F.2d at 275.\n                           \n\n                                8\n\nCir. 1993) (en banc).  Most of the courts that have  read section\n\n3583(e) to foreclose the imposition of a post-revocation  term of\n\nsupervised  release  have done  so  under  the  banner  of  plain\n\nmeaning.   Those courts read  the word \"revoke\" as  signifying an\n\nextinguishment so uncompromising as to preclude a post-revocation\n\nterm of supervision.  See, e.g., McGee, 981 F.2d at 274; Koehler,\n                                                                \n\n973 F.2d at  134-35; Holmes,  954 F.2d at  272.  This  inflexible\n                           \n\ninsistence upon a particular  version of lexicographic  orthodoxy\n\nseemingly overlooks  that \"the  plain-meaning doctrine  is not  a\n\npedagogical absolute.\"  Greenwood Trust Co. v.

In  particular, \"[t]erms  in an  act whose  meaning may\n\nappear plain  outside the  scheme of  the statute  can take  on a\n\ndifferent  meaning  when  read in  their  proper  context.\"   Id.\n                                                                 \n\n(citing various Supreme Court precedents).\n\n          The  Williams court  found \"revoke\"  plain enough,  but\n                       \n\nread it differently.  It suggested that \"revoke\" could be read in\n\nthe  alternative sense of \"call back.\"   Williams, 2 F.3d at 365.\n                                                 \n\nThis sense  is best illustrated  by the poet William  Cowper, who\n\nwrote:\n\n          How readily we wish time spent revok'd,\n\n          That we might try the ground again. . . . \n\nThe Task,  Book VI,  l.25 (1784);  see also supra  p. 7  (quoting\n                                                 \n\nBlack's  Law  Dictionary).   While  we  regard  this approach  as\n\nplausible,  we   do  not   see  why  even   the  most   inelastic\n\ninterpretation of \"revoke\"  would frustrate a reading  of the SRR\n\n                                9\n\nprovision  that permits imposition  of a post-revocation  term of\n\nsupervision.    If  a  term  has been  called  back,  it  may  be\n\nreimposed.  If a term has been absolutely terminated, a  new term\n                                                            \n\nstill may be imposed    in the same  way that, once a  license is\n\nrevoked, a  new one  may be  issued.   In the  end, the  semantic\n\ndebate over the  word \"revoke\" turns out  to be no more  than the\n\nswapping  of heuristics.  No matter how  the word is defined, the\n\nlanguage of the SRR provision  is consistent with the possibility\n\nthat  a post-revocation  term  of  supervision  lawfully  may  be\n\nimposed.\n\n          We  believe  this linguistic  intuition is  verified by\n\nhistorical  precedents.    Previous  Congresses  used   the  word\n\n\"revoke\"  in  crafting  the  statutory  forerunners  of   section\n\n3583(e)(3).   See, e.g., 18  U.S.C.   4214 (1988)  (repealed 1984\n                       \n\nanent offenses committed  after November 1, 1987)  (revocation of\n\nparole); 21 U.S.C.A.   841(c) (1981 &amp; Supp. 1993) (repealed 1984)\n\n(revocation of special parole); 18 U.S.C.   3653 (1988) (repealed\n\n1984 anent offenses committed after November 1, 1987) (revocation\n\nof  probation).   Notwithstanding  Congress's  use  of  the  word\n\n\"revoke,\" it was widely thought  that reimposition of a period of\n\nnon-detentive monitoring,  to commence  following post-revocation\n\nimprisonment, was permitted  under all three of  these antecedent\n\nstatutory provisions.  See infra Part IV(D).\n                                \n\n                                B\n\n          Our structural analysis of the  alteration statute and,\n\nparticularly,  of the SRR  provision starts with  the recognition\n\n                                10\n\nthat  the  first  appellate court  to  interpret  section 3583(e)\n\nrested its holding  on the notion that the  alteration statute is\n\nstructured as  a set  of discrete options  separated by  the word\n\n\"or.\"   Given  the shape  of the  statute, the court  reasoned, a\n\njudge  may either  \"extend\" the  term under subsection  (e)(2) or\n\n\"revoke\"  it  under  subsection  (e)(3),  but   not  both.    See\n                                                                 \n\nBehnezhad, 907 F.2d  at 898-99.  Subsequent courts  quickly moved\n         \n\nbeyond this  restrictive rationale,  realizing that it  collapses\n\ninto  the debate  over  the  meaning of  the  SRR provision  and,\n\ntherefore, proves  nothing.  See,  e.g., McGee, 981 F.2d  at 274;\n                                              \n\nHolmes, 954 F.2d at 272.\n      \n\n          To the extent  that the repeated use of the disjunctive\n\nin section  3583(e)  sheds any  light  on Congress's  intent,  we\n\nbelieve that it favors a broad reading of the SRR provision.  The\n\nfirst principal option that the alteration  statute presents to a\n\ndistrict  judge is  to \"terminate\"  the  supervised release  term\n\npreviously imposed under subsection (e)(1).  If Congress meant to\n\n\"revoke\" supervised  release in  the hard sense  of the  word, it\n\ncould simply  have used  the same language  twice.   Most likely,\n\nthen, to  \"revoke\" as used  in the SRR provision  means something\n\nother than to \"terminate\".\n\n                                C\n\n          Two  general  principles  of  statutory  interpretation\n\ninform  our  conclusion that  the  SRR provision  cannot  be read\n\ngrudgingly:   the  principle that  the grant  of a  greater power\n\nnecessarily  includes the  grant of  a lesser  power, unless  the\n\n                                11\n\nauthority to exercise  a lesser power is  expressly reserved; and\n\nthe  principle  that  statutes  should  not  be  read to  produce\n\nillogical results.\n\n          1.   The Greater  Includes the  Lesser.   The principle\n          1.   The Greater  Includes the  Lesser.\n                                                \n\nthat the grant  of a greater power includes the grant of a lesser\n\npower is  a  bit of  common  sense that  has  been recognized  in\n\nvirtually every  legal code from  time immemorial.  It  has found\n\nmodern expression primarily  in the realm of  constitutional law.\n\nSee, e.g., City  of Lakewood v.

To\n\nillustrate,  we  use  an  example  that  bears  a  strong  family\n\nresemblance  to the  problem  at hand.    The federal  sentencing\n\nguidelines originally  stated  that  \"an  extraordinary  physical\n\nimpairment  may be  a  reason  to impose  a  sentence other  than\n\nimprisonment.\"  U.S.S.G.  5H1.4, p.s. (Nov. 1990).   Three courts\n\nof  appeals, including  this  one,  refused  to  understand  this\n\nprovision to require an all-or-nothing choice between imposing an\n\nincarcerative  sentence within the guideline range or imposing no\n\nprison  sentence.     The  courts  reasoned  that,   despite  the\n\n                                12\n\nunvarnished  language of the provision, the greater departure (no\n\nincarceration)  necessarily  included  the  lesser  departure  (a\n\nprison  sentence below  the bottom  of  the guideline  sentencing\n\nrange).

App. C,  Amend. 386\n                                   \n(Nov. 1991).\n\n                                13\n\nStat. Const.   45.12 (5th ed.).  This principle goes back  to the\n            \n\nearly days of  the Republic.  See M'Culloch v.  Maryland, 17 U.S.\n                                                        \n\n(4 Wheat.) 316, 355 (1819). \n\n          In this case, the sentencing  rule that emerges from  a\n\nnarrow reading of section 3583(e)(3) is surpassingly difficult to\n\ndefend  from a policy  perspective.  It  is hard to  conceive any\n\nlogical   reason  why  Congress  might  authorize  sentencing  an\n\noffender to a non-mandatory term of imprisonment, variable in the\n\njudge's  discretion,  upon  revocation of  a  term  of supervised\n\nrelease,  but would,  at  the same  time,  withhold authority  to\n\nimpose  a sentence  of  equivalent  duration  upon  more  lenient\n\nconditions.  See Williams, 2  F.3d at 365; Schrader, 973  F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n625.  Although we could jury-rig a  legislative justification for\n\nso cramped an  interpretation of the  law, we think  it is  self-\n\nevident that barring judges from reimposing supervision following\n\nrevocation  needlessly inhibits  the  court's sentencing  options\n\nwhile at the same time failing to advance any of the  fundamental\n\ngoals of criminal sentencing.4   As a matter of policy, then, the\n\nimplications for sentencing  inherent in a stingy  reading of the\n\nSRR provision  go a long  way toward convincing us  that Congress\n\ncould not have favored (or intended to compel) such a reading.  \n\n                                D\n\n          As  a rule, courts should resort to legislative history\n\n                    \n\n     4The  fundamental goals  of the  Sentencing  Reform Act  are\ncommonly   thought   to    include   uniformity,   honesty,   and\nproportionality.

We  believe the  same\n\nprinciple applies in construing the Sentencing Reform Act itself.\n\n          To  place   the  genealogy  of  supervised  release  in\n\nhistorical context,  one must first recognize  that non-detentive\n\nmonitoring developed  along two  separate lines:   probation  and\n\nparole.     The  Sentencing   Reform  Act,  and   the  guidelines\n\nimplementing  it, swept aside both of these modalities, replacing\n\nprobation with an entirely new creature bearing the same name and\n\nreplacing parole (as well as its interim variant, special parole)\n\nwith supervised release.

Most existing provisions  for non-\ndetentive monitoring  were  repealed  in  1984  as  part  of  the\nSentencing Reform Act,  but the repeal did not  take effect until\nNovember  1, 1987.   However,  the special  parole provision,  21\nU.S.C.   841(b)(1)(A), was repealed outright.  Thus, from October\n12, 1984 through October 27, 1986, neither special parole nor any\nsubstitute for it was in force.  Apparently desiring to eliminate\nthis  hiatus, Congress  amended  the  law  to  insert  supervised\nrelease in lieu  of special parole for the  interval from October\n27, 1986 to November 1, 1987.  Congress accomplished this feat by\namending 21 U.S.C.   841(b) (under which no provision is made for\nrevocation).   Subsequent to November 1, 1987, supervised release\nhas been  controlled by the  provisions of the  Sentencing Reform\nAct.

Moreover,  it seems  highly likely  that Congress,  in\n\nreplacing a repealed provision with a new provision of hauntingly\n\nsimilar wording, intended that the pre-guidelines  interpretation\n\nwould  continue to  apply.    Otherwise,  Congress  would  almost\n\ncertainly have altered the language to clarify its intent   as it\n\ndid in connection with probation, see supra Part IV(D)(1).\n                                           \n\n          For these reasons,  the historical development  of non-\n\ndetentive  monitoring, in  all its  permutations,  reinforces our\n\nintuition that  Congress meant  to leave  undisturbed the  widely\n\naccepted  pre-guidelines  practice  of  allowing district  courts\n\ndiscretion to  order a  period of non-detentive  monitoring as  a\n\npart of the sentence imposed  for violation of supervised release\n\n                                20\n\nconditions.\n\n                                E\n\n          Studying what has transpired  in Congress subsequent to\n\nthe passage of  the alteration statute produces  another possible\n\naid to statutory construction.  The focus here is on a bipartisan\n\nquartet   comprising four senior members  of the Senate Judiciary\n\nCommittee     thought to  have been supremely influential  in the\n\npassage  of  the  Sentencing  Reform  Act:    Senators  Thurmond,\n\nKennedy, Biden,  and Hatch.    These senators  uniformly favor  a\n\nclarifying amendment  that would  remove any  doubt that  section\n\n3583(e)(3) allows reimposition of supervised release.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\n137 Cong. Rec. S10021 (daily  ed. July 15, 1991) (text  of S.188,\n\nsponsored by Sens.

This  history  strongly  suggests  that  the\n\namendment  remains  unpassed  only because  the  vagaries  of the\n\nparliamentary process are  what they are.  When,  as now, the two\n\nhouses of Congress, in the wake of a series of judicial decisions\n\ngoing mainly in one direction,  have repeatedly signified that an\n\namendment is needed  to clarify recently enacted  legislation, it\n\nseems reasonable  to infer that  the courts have failed  to grasp\n\nthe enacting Congress's intent.  In such circumstances,  the case\n\nfor giving some modest weight to post-enactment history peaks.\n\n                                F\n\n          At   this  point,  we  have  marshalled  the  available\n\ndata.10  We have found neither  of the contending readings to  be\n\nobviously correct on  the statute's face, and we  have deterrated\n\nno  direct evidence of congressional intent sufficient to capture\n\nthe flag.  In the  end, however, three considerations persuade us\n\nthat a broader interpretation of the SRR provision is more likely\n\n                    \n\n     10In the  process, we have  considered   and rejected    the\nnotion  that  the rule  of  lenity, a  background  principle that\nproperly comes into play when, at the  end of a thorough inquiry,\nthe meaning of a criminal  statute remains obscure, see  Chapman,\n                                                                \n111  S.  Ct.  at  1926,  might  be  of  help  here  in discerning\ncongressional  intent.    See, e.g.,  Koehler,  923  F.2d  at 135\n                                             \n(arguing  that  the rule  of lenity  cuts  in favor  of  a narrow\nconstruction  of  the  SRR  provision).    The  problem  lies  in\ndetermining whose ox may be gored.  Depending on the facts of any\nparticular defendant's situation,  a generous reading of  the SRR\nprovision can produce  either a harsher or a  more lenient result\nthan  a  cramped reading  will  produce.    Thus, we  regard  the\ninterpretive struggle over the SRR provision as lenity-neutral.\n\n                                23\n\nwhat  Congress   intended.     First,  a   narrow  rendering   is\n\ninharmonious with  the statute as  a whole.  Second,  in choosing\n\nbetween  two  plausible  readings,  we  hesitate  to  select  the\n\nalternative that in effect imputes to Congress a policy for which\n\nno  compelling rationale  can  be postulated  (and  that, in  the\n\nbargain, blindly treats a greater power as if it did not  include\n\na  lesser  power).     Third,  given  a  statute   of  protracted\n\nindeterminacy, we are  inclined to favor the  interpretation that\n\npromotes continuity  with traditional  sentencing practice    all\n\nthe  more  so  since  the   preexisting  practice  was  based  in\n\nsignificant  part upon  a  similarly worded  statute.   For these\n\nreasons, and despite our abiding respect for the courts that have\n\ngone the  other way, we hold that the  district judge did not err\n\nin concluding that he possessed the power to impose both a prison\n\nterm and a  term of  supervised release  following revocation  of\n\nappellant's original supervision term.\n\nV. APPLYING THE SRR PROVISION\n\n          Having  determined  that   the  court  below  correctly\n\ngrasped  the essential  meaning  of the  SRR provision,  we find,\n\nnonetheless,  that it  erred in fashioning  appellant's sentence.\n\nIn this case, upon revocation  of the original term of supervised\n\nrelease, the  SRR provision yields  a maximum sentence  length of\n\nthree years.  See 18 U.S.C.   3583(e)(3).  No more than two years\n                 \n\n                                24\n\nof that  period can be devoted to incarceration.11   See id.  The\n                                                            \n\nkey to  these computations  is that the  combined limit  of three\n\nyears matches the length of  the original term of supervision and\n\nthe  secondary limitation    two  years in  prison    matches the\n\nstatutory maximum allowable for revocation of  supervised release\n\nwhen the underlying offense  is a Class  D felony.   See id.   In\n                                                            \n\nlight of  these  benchmarks, it  is  apparent that  the  sentence\n\nimposed here  exceeded the  maximum sentence  authorized by  law.\n\nSpecifically,  upon   revocation  of   supervised  release,   the\n\nimposition of a  two-year prison term followed by  a fresh three-\n\nyear supervision term is unlawful.\n\n          Although O'Neil's sentence must be vacated, at least in\n\npart,  the contours of  the appropriate remedy  remain tenebrous.\n\nOn one hand, the government tells us that we should in effect lop\n\n                    \n\n     11We  are  aware  that the  Sentencing  Commission's  policy\nstatement contemplates that  the new term of imprisonment will be\n\"less  than\"  the  maximum term  of  imprisonment  imposable upon\nrevocation for each class of offense, U.S.S.G.  7B1.3(g)(2) p.s.,\nbut  we use  round  numbers  for  simplicity's sake.

On remand, the\n          \nlower  court must consider, but  need not necessarily follow, the\nSentencing Commission's recommendations regarding post-revocation\nsentencing. \n\n                                25\n\noff the last two years of the supervision term, thus bringing the\n\nsentence into statutory alignment.  On the other  hand, appellant\n\nurges  us   to  vacate   the  whole   sentence  and  remand   for\n\nresentencing,  thus permitting the district court, armed with our\n\ninsights into the  workings of the SRR provision,  to rethink its\n\noptions.    While   there  is   precedent  for   each  of   these\n\nalternatives, compare, e.g.,  United States v. Vasquez,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"322277\"><a href=\"/opinion/322277/united-states-v-santos-marin-vasquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n                                                      \n\n<span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 556 (5th Cir. 1974) (per curiam) (holding that the excessive\n\nportion  of a  sentence may  be  trimmed and  the remainder  left\n\nintact) with, e.g., United States v. Berkowitz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"291391\"><a href=\"/opinion/291391/united-states-v-samuel-berkowitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 928\n                                              \n\n(1st  Cir.  1970)  (vacating entire  sentence  and  remanding for\n\nresentencing), we believe that the latter option is preferable in\n\nthis case.  We explain briefly.\n\n          Although   subject   to   constitutional   constraints,\n\nstatutory limitations, and, now,  the guidelines, sentencing  is,\n\nby  and  large,  within  the  province  of  the  district  court.\n\nSentences  usually  contain  a variety  of  components,  e.g., an\n                                                             \n\nincarcerative component,  a monetary  component (say,  a fine  or\n\ncost-of-confinement  order),  and a  non-detentive,  non-monetary\n\ncomponent  (say, supervised  release).   These  components  often\n\ninterrelate.   Where  an appellate  court unties  the  bundle and\n\ndecides that one component must  be reconfigured, it may often be\n\nbetter practice  to enlist  the district  court  to retrofit  the\n\npackage.  So  it is here.  We think that  the district court, not\n\nthis court, is  best equipped to gauge what  the overall sentence\n\nshould be.  See generally  United States v. Pimienta-Redondo, 874\n                                                            \n\n                                </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">9</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14  (1st  Cir.) (en  banc)  (discussing resentencing  in\n\nmultiple-count case after determination  that the Double Jeopardy\n\nClause  barred  imposition of  separate  sentence on  one  of two\n\ncounts of conviction), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989).\n                                   \n\nVI   CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go no further.  We hold that the SRR provision,\n\n18 U.S.C.   3583(e)(3), permits a district court, upon revocation\n\nof a term of supervised release, to impose a prison sentence or a\n\nsentence  combining   incarceration  with   a  further   term  of\n\nsupervised release, so  long as (1) the  incarcerative portion of\n\nthe sentence does not exceed the time limit specified  in the SRR\n\nprovision itself, and  (2) the combined length of  the new prison\n\nsentence cum supervision term does not exceed the duration of the\n            \n\noriginal term  of supervised release.   Since the  district court\n\noverstepped these  boundaries, we vacate appellant's sentence and\n\nremand for resentencing.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n                \n\n                                27\n</pre>",
