The Remaining Convictions\n\n          A.   Federal Bribery Conspiracy (Autiello)\n\n          Autiello argues that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport his conviction for federal bribery conspiracy in connection\n\nwith the Maggiacomo Job scheme.   Autiello contends that, because\n\nthere was no direct evidence about either the identity of his co-\n\nconspirator or the fate of the $5,000 Mary Maggiacomo paid him, the\n\nevidence gave nearly equal circumstantial support to an inference\n\nthat he pocketed the money as a payment for his efforts with the\n\npolice department (with which he had influence) on behalf of Joseph\n\nMaggiacomo as it did to an inference that he passed the bribe along\n\nto some public official, or at least conspired to do so.       See\n\nUnited States v. Andujar, 49 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"If the\n\nevidence viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution\n\ngives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of\n\nguilty and a theory of innocence of the crime charged, this court\n\nmust reverse the conviction.\") (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).   The argument is unconvincing.\n\n          There was evidence that, during a face-to-face meeting in\n\nwhich his favorable intercessions were sought, Autiello told Mary\n\nMaggiacomo and her husband that Providence police officer positions\n\nwere prized and that Joseph Maggiacomo's chances were not good\n\nbecause the Maggiacomos were not Providence taxpayers and had not\n\nmade any \"contributions.\" In nearly the same breath, Autiello told\n\n\n                               -50-\n\fthem that, if they wanted Joseph to be accepted into the police\n\nacademy, they would have to come up with $5,000 in cash.       The\n\njuxtaposition of these two comments, combined with the evidence\n\nthat Autiello himself held no authority to make police academy\n\nadmission decisions, permitted a reasonable inference that the\n\n$5,000 was to be a political \"contribution\" that would serve as\n\nJoseph's ticket of admission when passed along to someone with\n\nauthority over academy admission decisions.\n\n          B.   Hobbs Act Attempted Extortion and\n          Extortion Conspiracy (Corrente)\n\n          Corrente makes three arguments in favor of reversing or\n\nvacating his convictions for Hobbs Act attempted extortion and\n\nHobbs Act extortion conspiracy in connection with the Freitas Lease\n\nand Freitas Invoices schemes: (1) there was insufficient evidence\n\nthat these schemes had the constitutionally required impact on\n\ninterstate commerce; (2) there was insufficient evidence that he\n\naffirmatively acted in such a way as to be fairly accused of having\n\nattempted or conspired to engage in extortion; and (3) the district\n\ncourt's jury instructions erroneously described what was required\n\nto establish an attempt or conspiracy to engage in extortion.\n\nThere is some question whether each of these arguments was made\n\nbelow as to each of the three convictions, but we bypass issues of\n\nforfeiture because none of the arguments is persuasive on its\n\nmerits.\n\n\n\n                               -51-\n\f           Corrente's      first    argument   is    largely    based     on    an\n\nassertion that his convictions are unconstitutional because his\n\noffense conduct had to, but did not, have more than a de minimis\n\neffect on interstate commerce in order to jibe with the Supreme\n\nCourt's decisions in United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995),\n\nand United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000).               After briefs\n\nwere filed in this case, another panel of the court rejected this\n\nargument, United States v. Capozzi, 347 F.3d 327, 334-336 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), so we must reject it too, see, e.g., United States v. Downs-\n\nMoses, 329 F.3d 253, 263 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n      Corrente alternatively argues that no reasonable factfinder\n\ncould have found that his offense conduct had such a de minimis\n\neffect.    He is wrong.\n\n            With   respect    to    Corrente's      attempted   extortion       in\n\nconnection with the Freitas Lease scheme, the jury could have found\n\nthat, but for Freitas' agreement to pay Corrente for favorable\n\nintervention on his behalf with the school department, there was a\n\nrealistic probability that the City contractor (an entity engaged\n\nin   interstate    commerce   and    whose   lease    agreement   would    be    a\n\ntransaction affecting interstate commerce12) would have leased space\n\nin   Cranston,     Rhode   Island.      This     evidence   alone    satisfies\n\n\n\n      12\n      The contractor, the Marriott Corporation, supplied lunches\nand custodial services to all Providence schools.      There was\nevidence that the company was incorporated in New York and had\noffices in Washington, D.C., and Newark, Delaware.\n\n                                     -52-\n\fconstitutional concerns, even if the space for which Corrente\n\nadvocated actually proved to be a better fit for the contractor.\n\nSee Capozzi, 347 F.3d at 335 (extortionate conduct need only create\n\na realistic probability of an effect on interstate commerce)\n\n(citations omitted); id. at 337 (conviction for attempted extortion\n\nrequires only a showing that the identified effect would have\n\noccurred had the defendant succeeded in the extortion); United\n\nStates   v.    Tormos-Vega,     959    F.2d   1103,    1113   (1st    Cir.   1992)\n\n(extortionate conduct meets constitutional requirements even where\n\nit \"has a beneficial effect on interstate commerce\") (citation and\n\ninternal      quotation    marks     omitted);   id.    (where   the    victim's\n\nacquiescence in an extortion results in a transaction with effects\n\non interstate commerce, constitutional concerns are satisfied).\n\n              With respect to the Freitas Invoices scheme, the jury\n\ncould have found that a city contractor that was indisputably\n\nengaged in interstate commerce was deprived of $1,100 in order to\n\nfacilitate payments to which it was entitled.                 This was enough.\n\nSee Capozzi, 347 F.3d at 337 (\"One common method for the government\n\nto   establish    the     required    'de   minimis    effect'   on    interstate\n\ncommerce is to show that the defendant's activity \"minimally\n\ndepletes the assets of an entity doing business in interstate\n\ncommerce.\") (quoting United States v. Nguyen, 246 F.3d 52, 54 (1st\n\nCir. 2001)).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -53-\n\f            Corrente's other two arguments are very difficult to\n\nfollow. In the main, they appear to be interrelated attacks on the\n\ncorrectness of Evans v. United States, 504 U.S. 260 (1992).                    Evans\n\ninterpreted the provision of the Hobbs Act under which Corrente was\n\nconvicted    --   one   which   prohibits      extortion   by    means    of    \"the\n\nobtaining of property from another, with his consent, . . . [2]\n\nunder color of official right,\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2) -- not to\n\nrequire that the government prove that the defendant initiated the\n\nextortionate      transaction    or    otherwise      induced    the     payments.\n\nRather, \"the Government need only show that a public official has\n\nobtained a payment to which he was not entitled, knowing that the\n\npayment was made in return for official acts.\"                     Id. at 268.\n\nCorrente    appears     to   believe    that    the   Evans     Court    erred   in\n\nconcluding that the defendant need not induce the payment or\n\notherwise initiate the event.           See Corrente Br. at 49.            To the\n\nextent that he is so arguing, Corrente acknowledges that we are\n\npowerless to grant him relief and that he must go to the Supreme\n\nCourt.     Id.\n\n            There are hints of other arguments in Corrente's brief,\n\nbut none is sufficiently developed to warrant consideration on the\n\nmerits.     See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).     In any event, our review of the record convinces us that\n\nthere is no basis for reversing or vacating Corrente's attempted\n\nextortion and extortion conspiracy convictions.\n\n\n                                       -54-\n\f               Any sufficiency challenge is doomed because there was\n\nsufficient evidence to support the convictions even under the more\n\ndemanding interpretation of the Hobbs Act for which Corrente\n\nadvocates.       With respect to the Freitas Lease scheme, the jury\n\ncould have found that Corrente \"induced\" payments from Freitas\n\nwhen, at one point prior to receiving any money related to this\n\nscheme, he suggested to Freitas that City Hall could either hurt or\n\nhelp his chances of securing the lease (depending, presumably, on\n\nwhether Freitas anted up).          With respect to the Freitas Invoices\n\nscheme, the jury could have found that Pannone, Corrente's co-\n\nconspirator, induced payments on Corrente's behalf by encouraging\n\nFreitas to \"throw something\" at Corrente – i.e., to \"pay to get\n\npaid.\"\n\n               So too with the jury instructions.        As clarified in a\n\nsupplemental charge just prior to the return of the verdicts, the\n\ninstructions on the attempted extortion and extortion conspiracy\n\ncharges were, if anything, overly generous to Corrente.                     And\n\nbecause the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions even\n\nunder    the    arguably    too   lenient    instructions,    any   error   was\n\nharmless.      See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a); United States v. Royal, 100\n\nF.3d 1019, 1027 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nIV.            Admission of the Pannone Tapes\n\n               Defendants   contend   that   the   district   court   violated\n\nvarious Rules of Evidence and their confrontation and due process\n\n\n                                      -55-\n\frights      in   admitting    into    evidence     certain     tape-recorded\n\nconversations among Freitas (who was acting as a government agent),\n\nPannone, the Chairman of the Board of Tax Assessment Review and an\n\nalleged     co-conspirator,    and   various     other   individuals,   some\n\nidentified and others not.      They also argue that the court erred in\n\nprecluding them from interposing objections to the admission of\n\nthese tape recordings for their failure to abide by a procedural\n\norder requiring that Rule 403 and 404(b) objections be identified\n\nwith specificity in advance of trial.\n\n             A. Petrozziello determination\n\n             Defendants argue that the district court erred when it\n\nconcluded that Pannone's statements fell outside of the hearsay\n\nrule     under   Fed.   R.   Evid.   801(d)(2)(E).13      We   review   this\n\ndetermination for clear error. United States v. Geronimo, 330 F.3d\n\n67, 74 (1st Cir. 2003); Marino, 277 F.3d at 25.              In determining\n\nwhether the Government has met Rule 801(d)(2)(E) prerequisites, the\n\ndistrict court must determine that it is \"more likely than not that\n\nthe declarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy when\n\nthe hearsay statement was made, and that the statement was in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.\" United States v. Petrozziello, 548\n\n\n\n\n       13\n      “A statement is not hearsay if . . . [t]he statement is\noffered against the party[-opponent] and is . . . a statement by a\ncoconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of\nthe conspiracy.” Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).\n\n                                     -56-\n\fF.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1977).         We refer to this determination as a\n\n“Petrozziello ruling.”      Geronimo, 330 F.3d at 75.\n\n            Defendants contend that there was \"scanty\" evidence of a\n\nconspiracy among defendants and Pannone. They argue that Pannone's\n\ntaped   statements   were    unreliable       and   there   was   insufficient\n\nextrinsic   evidence   of    the    conspiracies      because     some   of   the\n\nconversations on the tape were \"rambling and unfocused\" and not all\n\nof the defendants were ultimately convicted as part of the three\n\nracketeering acts--the Ronci Estate, Freitas Lease, and Freitas\n\nInvoices schemes--of which Pannone had first-hand knowledge.\n\n            We disagree.    As we have detailed supra, the government\n\npresented sufficient evidence of a RICO conspiracy--conspiracy,\n\nenterprise, and pattern of racketeering activity–-to satisfy the\n\nevidentiary standard set forth in Petrozziello.             In particular, on\n\ntape, Corrente intimated to Freitas with respect to the Freitas\n\nLease   scheme,   \"Don't    get    involved    with   Joe   unless   something\n\nhappens.\"    Corrente also admits on tape to receiving cash from\n\nPannone in connection with the Pay-to-Get-Paid scheme.                   Pannone\n\nchaired the Board of Tax Assessment Review, a municipal office\n\nwhich we have already detailed to be crucial to the conspiracy.\n\nBoth Freitas and Ead testified at trial to Pannone’s involvement in\n\nthe Ronci Estate, Freitas Lease, and Pay-to-Get Paid schemes. With\n\nregard to the Ronci Estate scheme, the evidence showed a sub-\n\nconspiracy among Cianci, Corrente, and Pannone to extort money from\n\n\n                                     -57-\n\fthe Ronci estate in exchange for a reduction of back taxes owed to\n\nthe City and the assessment of property owned by the estate.               At\n\nthe times the taped statements were made, the evidence also shows\n\na conspiracy between at least Corrente and Pannone to extort money\n\nfrom Tony Freitas and JKL Engineering in exchange for assistance in\n\nleasing property owned by Freitas to the City or to the Marriott\n\nCorporation.        Third, the evidence was sufficient to establish a\n\nconspiracy between at least Corrente and Pannone to extort money\n\nfrom Freitas and JKL in exchange for facilitating payments due from\n\nthe City to JKL.\n\n              Pannone’s taped statements were not made “after the\n\nfact,” but were uttered as part of and in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.     In these statements, Pannone described the roles that\n\nhe, Cianci, Corrente, and Ead played in the conspiracy and in\n\nparticular, what he and Freitas should do to carry out the Freitas\n\nLease and Pay-to-Get-Paid schemes. Such statements are well within\n\nthe core of Rule 801(d)(2)(E).           See United States v. Martinez-\n\nMedina, 279 F.3d 105, 117 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 921\n\n(2002); United States v. Eke, 117 F.3d 19, 21 (1st Cir. 1997).            The\n\ndistrict court did not commit clear error in admitting the Pannone\n\ntapes   and    we    decline   to   reverse   defendants’   convictions    on\n\nPetrozziello grounds.\n\nB.            Confrontation Clause and Due Process claims\n\n\n\n\n                                      -58-\n\f            Defendants contend that Pannone’s taped statements are\n\ninherently unreliable and hence should not have been admitted in\n\nevidence.     As   a     constitutional         matter,   they    claim     that   the\n\nstatements’    unreliability        implicates       Sixth      Amendment    witness\n\nconfrontation concerns.          This Court reviews Confrontation Clause\n\nchallenges de novo. United States v. Ventura-Melendez, 275 F.3d 9,\n\n15 (1st Cir. 2001).       The Confrontation Clause does not require \"a\n\nshowing of unavailability as a condition to admission of the out-\n\nof-court statements of a nontestifying co-conspirator, when those\n\nstatements otherwise satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 801(d)(2)(E).\"          United States v. Inadi, 475 U.S. 387, 391\n\n(1986).     It also \"does not require a court to embark on an\n\nindependent inquiry into the reliability of statements that satisfy\n\nthe requirements of Rule 801(d)(2)(E).\"                    Bourjaily v. United\n\nStates, 483 U.S. 171, 183-84 (1987).\n\n            Defendants      argue        that    notwithstanding       Inadi       and\n\nBourjaily, Pannone's statements should not have been admitted\n\nbecause he was unavailable and unreliable.                 They assert that the\n\npresent case is anomalous and that \"corruption stings\" such as this\n\none should not fall within Inadi and Bourjaily.                   We find no case\n\nlaw   excepting    the    case    from    the    Inadi    and    Bourjaily    rules.\n\nDefendants further suggest that Pannone was outside of his \"natural\n\nhabitat\" because Freitas was eliciting incriminating statements\n\nfrom him as part of his cooperation with the FBI.                           Pannone,\n\n\n                                         -59-\n\fhowever, was unaware that he was being stung.   We see no reason how\n\nhis behavior would have been different had Freitas been making the\n\nsame conversation without the FBI’s direction.\n\n          To further address defendants’ contention that Pannone’s\n\nstatements are inherently unreliable, we agree with the district\n\ncourt that Pannone “did have or was in a position to have firsthand\n\nknowledge of some of the things that he testified about.”    He was\n\nan insider to the conspiracy.   Again, he was directly involved and\n\neven played a supervisory role in the Ronci Estate, Freitas Lease,\n\nand Freitas Invoices schemes.      Trial testimony by Ead, Rocha,\n\nFreitas, and others corroborated Pannone’s taped statements setting\n\nout how Corrente was often the middleman in the racket, that Cianci\n\nused Corrente as a buffer, and that money given to Corrente found\n\nits way into the campaign and eventually benefitted Cianci or the\n\nadministration in some way.     Taped conversations between Freitas\n\nand Corrente confirmed the same.\n\n          The government questions Cianci and Corrente's motive for\n\nfailing to call Pannone as a witness for cross-examination as Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 806 permits.   Cianci and Corrente repeatedly contend that\n\nPannone was unavailable to them because he would assert his Fifth\n\nAmendment rights against self-incrimination if called to testify.\n\nThey claim that Pannone’s behavior was \"orchestrated\" by the\n\nGovernment in their plea arrangements with him.\n\n\n\n\n                                -60-\n\f            This alleged \"attempt to thwart cross-examination\" forms\n\nthe basis of defendants’ Fifth Amendment due process claim.                           The\n\nprocedural travel of the case, however, reveals little to support\n\nthis accusation.        The indictment in this case originally named\n\nPannone as a defendant on Counts 1, 2, 8, 9, 16-19, and 21-24.                         On\n\nFebruary 14, 2002, he signed a plea agreement in which he agreed to\n\nplead guilty to Counts 1, 2, 8, 16, 19, and 22.                      The government\n\nagreed to dismiss the remaining counts at sentencing.                              Hence,\n\ndismissal of the remaining charges against Pannone was contingent\n\nupon sentencing.\n\n            On     April    16,     2002,   during      a    hearing      to    resolve\n\ndefendants’      motion     to    exclude      the    Pannone     tapes,       Corrente\n\ncomplained that Pannone’s plea agreement had “left open” the\n\nremaining     counts,       suggesting      that      Pannone’s      fear       of    the\n\ngovernment’s handling of the remaining counts would cause him to\n\nassert his Fifth Amendment rights if he were called by the defense\n\nto testify.      The court, though ultimately rejecting defendants’\n\nlegal arguments, assured them that it would try to accelerate\n\nPannone’s sentencing, which at that time had been scheduled for\n\nJuly.\n\n            Thereafter,       the    district        court   moved     up      Pannone’s\n\nsentencing    in    order    to     accommodate      defendants      in     this     case.\n\nPannone was sentenced on May 24, 2002, while the government was\n\nstill presenting its case-in-chief and almost two weeks before the\n\n\n                                        -61-\n\fdefense presented their own case.       Immediately after sentencing,\n\nthe government moved to dismiss the remaining counts against\n\nPannone; the court granted the motion.      During a bench conference\n\nfour days after Pannone’s sentencing, Corrente’s counsel briefly\n\nremarked that he had been informed by Pannone’s counsel that\n\nPannone would persist in his Fifth Amendment claim “because of a\n\nvariety of reasons which I won’t go into right now.”     Nothing more\n\nwas made of these “reasons.”\n\n            After this point, defendants did not attempt to call\n\nPannone as a witness.    We find no evidence that Pannone would have\n\ninvoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if\n\ncalled to testify, and whether the court would have permitted him\n\nto do so.   There simply is no evidence of an \"orchestration\" by the\n\ngovernment to keep Pannone away from defendants.     Thus, there were\n\nno constitutional infringements here.14\n\n            C.   Rules 403 and 404(b)\n\n            Finally, with respect to the Pannone tapes, defendants\n\nargue that the district court erred by failing to consider their\n\nobjections to admission of the tapes under Fed. R. Evid. 40315 and\n\n\n     14\n      To the extent that defendants’ due process claim incorporates\ntheir argument that Pannone’s statements are unreliable, our\naffirmance of the district court’s Petrozziello ruling sufficiently\nresponds to that claim.\n     15\n      “Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\nprejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\nconsiderations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless\n\n                                 -62-\n\f404(b).16       They claim that they made timely objections pre-trial.\n\nThey further recount that the court decided not to address the\n\nobjections prior to trial, but then mistakenly at trial ruled that\n\ndefendants waived their right to object to admission of the tapes.\n\n               We first recount the procedural history giving rise to\n\nthis issue.          On April 24, 2001, the government provided defendants\n\nwith        copies    of   the   two   hundred   tapes   relating   to   their\n\ninvestigation of defendants, along with an index showing the dates\n\nof the recordings and the conversation participants.                Three days\n\nlater, the court issued an Arraignment and Pre-trial Discovery\n\nOrder, whereby the government was ordered to provide the defendants\n\nwith transcripts of the tapes.            The court also ordered that all\n\npre-trial motions be filed by December 31, 2001.\n\n               The government eliminated all but twenty-two tapes as\n\npossible trial exhibits.          By October 31, 2001 –- two months before\n\nthe deadline for pre-trial motions and six months before the\n\n\n\n\npresentation of cumulative evidence.”            Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n       16\n      “Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts–Evidence of other crimes,\nwrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a\nperson in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may,\nhowever, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive,\nopportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or\nabsence of mistake or accident, provided that upon request by the\naccused, the prosecution in a criminal case shall provide\nreasonable notice in advance of trial, or during trial if the court\nexcuses pre-trial notice on good cause shown, of the general nature\nof any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.” Fed. R.\nEvid. 404(b).\n\n                                        -63-\n\fcommencement of trial –- the government had provided transcripts of\n\nthese twenty-two tapes to defendants.\n\n              On March 28, 2002, the district court issued a Pre-trial\n\nScheduling Order, which read:\n\n              On or before April 12, 2002, counsel for any\n              party    disputing     the    audibility    of\n              admissibility of any such recording or the\n              accuracy of any such transcript of any such\n              transcript shall file an objection identifying\n              the recording to which objection is being\n              made. Memoranda in support of objections to\n              the accuracy or completeness of transcripts\n              shall be accompanied by copies of the\n              transcripts objected to on which proposed\n              deletions and corrections are noted.\n              In offering recorded conversations, counsel\n              shall make every effort to edit out footage\n              that contains no audible discussion or\n              contains irrelevant material so that the jury\n              will not be required to listen for protracted\n              periods of time to portions of recordings that\n              provide little or no assistance in determining\n              the pertinent facts. In order to achieve that\n              objective, counsel shall meet and confer, in\n              advance, in an effort to resolve any disputes\n              with respect to editing.\n\n              . . . Failure to comply with the provisions of\n              this paragraph may be considered as a waiver,\n              by the proponent, of the right to offer the\n              recorded    conversation(s)   at   issue;   or,\n              alternatively, as a waiver of the right to\n              object    to    omission   of    the   recorded\n              conversation(s) and/or dispute the accuracy or\n              completeness of the transcript, as the case\n              may be.\n\n              On April 8, 2002, defendants filed a motion objecting to\n\nthe admission of the Pannone tapes.               They based their motion\n\nprimarily on Petrozziello and constitutional grounds, and mentioned\n\nRules   403    and   404   in   a   general   observation   that   “any   given\n\n                                       -64-\n\fstatement may also be inadmissible” under those rules.                They did\n\nnot   identify    which    statements    were   inadmissible,   but    instead\n\nsuggested that the court itself should “go through” the tapes\n\n“line-by-line, making individual assessments as to each declarative\n\nstatement.”      Defendants stated that they would provide the court\n\nwith a schedule identifying offending statements and detailing the\n\nbases for their exclusion.        They never provided this schedule.\n\n           At the April 16 hearing on the motion, defendants again\n\nfocused   on     Petrozziello      and    the   constitutional    theories.\n\nCorrente’s counsel acknowledged that the government had edited the\n\ntapes to deal with Rule 403 concerns.           Nothing more was said with\n\nregard to either 403 or 404.             The court denied the motion to\n\nsuppress the Pannone statements and refused to undertake the line-\n\nby-line analysis, explaining that it “would take easily, . . .\n\nweeks . . . and it would delay the trial by that period of time.”\n\nThe court expressed its plan to “minimize the risk of a mistrial in\n\nthe event that statements are presented that later are found not\n\nsatisfy the requirements” by requiring the government to present\n\n“additional evidence above and beyond the statements themselves to\n\nsupport a finding that they qualify as admissible co-conspirator\n\nstatements.”\n\n           On April 24, the second day of trial, the government in-\n\nchambers mentioned that defendants had failed to propose cuts to\n\nthe Pannone tapes.        In response to Corrente’s counsel’s suggestion\n\n\n                                     -65-\n\fthat the defense would later in the trial move to excise other\n\ntaped statements pursuant to Rules 403 and 404, the court stated\n\nthat such motions “should have been done long ago.”\n\n           Throughout trial, the court repeated that proposals for\n\ncuts to the tapes had been due by April 12, 2002, pursuant to its\n\nPre-trial Scheduling Order. Upon challenges at trial by defendants\n\nto the admissibility of individual tapes, the court stated that\n\nthey could not make these objections because they had failed to\n\ntender such an objection pre-trial.\n\n           Defendants argue that they complied with the pre-trial\n\nscheduling     order       because      they    timely   filed     \"an     objection\n\nidentifying the recording to which objection is being made\" as\n\nrequired by the Pre-trial Scheduling Order.              However, they fail to\n\nmention that the order also mandates that \"[m]emoranda in support\n\nof   objections    .   .    .   shall    be    accompanied    by   copies    of    the\n\ntranscripts objected to on which proposed deletions and corrections\n\nare noted.\"    Defendants failed to provide the district court with\n\nthese specific objections.           The supplemental schedule promised by\n\ndefendants never materialized; the schedule, moreover, was not an\n\n“extra” offer, but explicitly required by the order as part of any\n\nobjection to the tapes.          The district court declined to perform a\n\nline-by-line      assessment      of     the    transcripts      because    it    had\n\nspecifically provided in the order that the parties do it.                       After\n\nrepeated general       objections        non-compliant    with     the   procedural\n\n\n                                         -66-\n\forder, the court decided that the defendants waived their right to\n\nobject pursuant to the order.         It did not abuse its discretion in\n\nrefusing to entertain piecemeal objections to evidence in the\n\nPannone tapes.\n\n            Regardless, admission of the taped statements--which\n\ndefendants    still      have   failed    to    itemize--did      not    prejudice\n\ndefendants.      As   we   have   explained      supra,   the    government     has\n\nproduced    sufficient     evidence      of    the   tapes’     reliability     and\n\nprobative value.         Moreover, the court followed through on its\n\nassurance that it would “minimize the risk” of improper admission\n\nby requiring the government to produce evidence corroborative of\n\nstatements made in the tapes.\n\n            We stress that the court wisely recognized that stop-and-\n\ngo evidentiary evaluations of these tapes during trial would unduly\n\ndelay the case and perhaps even cause the very prejudice and\n\nconfusion that defendants contemplated in their general objection.\n\nAccordingly, the court fashioned a system well before trial through\n\nwhich it expected both parties to whittle down the tapes to their\n\nrelevant portions. See United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez, 319 F.3d\n\n12, 34 (1st Cir. 2003) (“The trial court has wide discretion in\n\ndetermining admissibility under Rule 403 since the trial judge ‘is\n\nmore directly familiar than a court of appeals with the need for\n\nthe evidence and its likely effect.”) (citations omitted).                       An\n\nimportant    part   of   this   system    was    for   defendants       to   produce\n\n\n                                      -67-\n\ftranscripts of the tapes denoting which portions they wished to\n\nredact out of Rule 403, Rule 404, constitutional, or Petrozziello\n\nconcerns.        Even   in   their   appeal,   defendants   persist   in   the\n\nambiguity of their objection to the tapes. Other circuits have not\n\ntolerated this type of objection.              See, e.g., United States v.\n\nHolland, 880 F.2d 1091, 1094-95 (9th Cir. 1989) (where some parts\n\nof audiotape were admissible but “much of the tape was irrelevant,”\n\nthe defendant’s “blanket objection to the admission of the tape\n\ndoes not preserve an objection to failure to redact the tape”).            We\n\nfind no abuse in the district court’s exercise of its broad\n\ndiscretion over Rule 403 and 404 considerations.\n\nV.   Cianci’s Taped Statement\n\n            A.     Hearsay\n\n            In 1995, a government agent posing as an air conditioning\n\nbusinessman taped his conversation with Cianci when he requested a\n\ncity contract.     Cianci assured the agent that he would refer him to\n\nAlan Sepe, who Cianci believed knew more about air conditioning\n\nmatters than he did.         Cianci then told the agent, \"[Sepe] is honest\n\nas the day is long.      He deals in governments and ____.      No one will\n\nask you for a thing.          If anybody does, you pick up the phone and\n\ncall me.    I'll cut his ____ off and have him arrested, okay?\"            The\n\nagent had said or done nothing to prompt discussion of corruption.\n\nThen, Cianci, in introducing the agent to an unidentified man,\n\nremarked, \"He's probably an FBI agent.\"\n\n\n                                      -68-\n\f          The   district   court    refused    to   admit   this    tape   on\n\nrelevancy grounds, holding that the conversation in it “does not\n\nrelate to any predicate act or to any specific matter with respect\n\nto which the Government has presented any evidence.”          In response\n\nto Cianci’s argument that the statements were admissible under the\n\n“state of mind” exception to the hearsay rule, see Fed. R. Evid.\n\n803(3), the court concluded, “This statement or the import of the\n\nstatement is to show what Mr. Cianci did or didn’t do on other\n\noccasions with respect to unrelated matters, so therefore it does\n\nnot fall under the exception to the hearsay rule created by Rule\n\n803(3) for state of mind existing at the time of the event in\n\nquestion.”   Cianci argues that the district court's refusal to\n\nadmit this taped statement in evidence was an abuse of discretion\n\nand violated his right to due process.        Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co.\n\nof North America, 100 F.3d 203, 213 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          The   district   court    deemed    Cianci’s   taped     statement\n\nirrelevant because it did \"not relate to any predicate act or to\n\nany specific matter with respect to which the Government has\n\npresented any evidence.\"    Cianci argues that the court failed to\n\nrecognize the statement’s relevance to the RICO charges in general.\n\nHe asserts that the statement tends to make the existence of the\n\nenterprise less likely than without the statement, Fed. R. Evid.\n\n401, and that the court “conflat[ed] the provisions of Rule 803(3)\n\n. . . with the relevancy requirements of Rule 401.”\n\n\n                                   -69-\n\f           Cianci recapitulates that if the statement in the tape is\n\nhearsay, it falls within the state of mind exception to the hearsay\n\nrule.     Fed. R. Evid. 803(3).             “To be admissible under this\n\nexception, a declaration, among other things, must 'mirror a state\n\nof mind, which, in light of all the circumstances, including\n\nproximity in time, is reasonably likely to have been the same\n\ncondition existing at the material time.’”              Colasanto, 100 F.3d at\n\n212 (quoting 2 John W. Strong, McCormick on Evidence § 274 (4th ed.\n\n1992)).      Cianci      contends     that       the    statement        evinces     a\n\ncontemporaneous      intent    not         to    endorse       bribery     in      his\n\nadministration, rather than a statement denying past instances of\n\ncorrupt acts.      In    addition     to    adopting    the     district    court’s\n\nconclusion that the statement evinced a “state of mind” as to\n\nevents or behavior on other occasions, the government argues that\n\nCianci's statements were self-serving, and hence outside the ambit\n\nof Rule 803(3), because he knew that he was talking to a federal\n\nagent.\n\n           As an initial matter, the taped statement is hearsay.\n\nCianci offered it to prove the truth of the assertion that Cianci\n\ndid not   tolerate      corruption.        Another     thing    is   certain:      the\n\nstatement was not admissible in order to show what Cianci might\n\nhave done or not done on other occasions not proximate to the time\n\nthe   statement   was    uttered.      The      only   purpose    for    which     the\n\nstatement could have been admitted would have been to establish\n\n\n                                      -70-\n\fCianci's state of mind at the time the statement was made.          Because\n\n\"disputes over whether particular statements come within the state-\n\nof-mind exception are fact-sensitive, the trial court is in the\n\nbest position to resolve them.\"      Colasanto, 100 F.3d at 212.       That\n\nthe statement was made at one point during the time of charged\n\nconspiracy   cannot    be   sufficient    to   mandate   its    admission,\n\nespecially where the latter part of the statement--“He's probably\n\nan FBI agent\"--places doubt on what Cianci claims is the probative\n\nvalue and relevance of the statement as a whole.         Whether Cianci’s\n\nstatement is “forward-looking” or refers to past acts and events is\n\nunclear   from   the   statement   itself.      Ths   issue    is   further\n\ncomplicated by the fact that Cianci’s mention of pay-offs was\n\n“gratuitous” and not provoked by anything the agent said or did.\n\nHence, it was within the district court’s discretion to conclude\n\nthat the statement, at least in part, applied to past acts of the\n\nCianci administration and were to a large extent “self-serving”\n\nattempts to cover tracks already made.           Such observations are\n\nwell-established grounds for non-admission.           See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Bishop, 264 F.3d 535, 549 (5th Cir. 2001), cert. denied,\n\n535 U.S. 1016 (2002); United States v. Miller, 874 F.2d 1255, 1265-\n\n66 (9th Cir. 1989); United States v. Jackson, 780 F.2d 1305, 1313-\n\n15 (7th Cir. 1986).     Thus, as the district court determined that\n\nCianci sought to admit the statement \"to show that he did not and\n\ndoes not take bribes or engage in corrupt activity,\" we are loath\n\n\n                                   -71-\n\fto disturb the court’s exercise of discretion to deny admission of\n\nthe statement.\n\n            B.    Due Process claim\n\n            Cianci claims that by denying admission of his taped\n\nstatement, the district court violated his Fifth Amendment due\n\nprocess right to “a meaningful opportunity to present a complete\n\ndefense.”   Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 687 (1986).            We review\n\nthis claim for plain error because it was not raised at trial.\n\nUnder plain error review, the defendant must show (1) that an error\n\noccurred (2) which was \"obvious\" in the sense that governing law\n\nwas clearly settled to the contrary, (3) affected the defendant's\n\nsubstantial      rights,   and   (4)   seriously   impaired   the   fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.               United\n\nStates v. Gomez, 255 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Application of evidentiary rules \"do not abridge an\n\naccused's right to present a defense so long as they are not\n\n'arbitrary' or 'disproportionate to the purposes they are designed\n\nto serve.' . . . [W]e have found the exclusion of evidence to be\n\nunconstitutionally arbitrary or disproportionate only where it has\n\ninfringed upon a weighty interest of the accused.\"            United States\n\nv. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 303, 308 (1998) (citing Rock v. Arkansas, 483\n\nU.S. 44, 56 (1987)).       We have described the Supreme Court's rule as\n\noverturning convictions only in \"egregious cases.\" Fortini v.\n\nMurphy, 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2001).              Cianci outlines his\n\n\n                                       -72-\n\f\"weighty interest\" as his effort to disprove the government's\n\ntheory    of    criminal    intent.     Even   if   we   were   to   give   some\n\nexculpatory value to the statement, given the amount of evidence of\n\nCianci’s criminal knowledge and intent presented at trial, its\n\nabsence from the evidence does not rise to an “egregious” violation\n\nof Cianci’s interest in defeating this part of the government’s\n\ncase. Arguably, the statement itself indicates that Cianci knew he\n\nwas talking to an FBI agent.           Regardless, the court acted well\n\nwithin its discretion in determining that Cianci’s taped statement\n\ndid not pass muster under Rule 401 and that its value, if any, fell\n\noutside    of     Rule     803(3)’s   exception     to   the    hearsay     rule.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the court’s refusal to admit his\n\ntaped statement did not constitute error, let alone plain error,\n\nand thus, Cianci’s due process claim fails.\n\nVI.   Conclusion\n\n               Accordingly, defendants’ convictions are affirmed.\n\nVII. Sentencing and Forfeiture Appeals\n\n               In light of the Supreme Court’s recent decision in\n\nBlakely v. Washington, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (June 24, 2004), we do not\n\ndecide the sentencing appeals raised by all defendants as well as\n\nchallenges by defendants and the government to the district court’s\n\nforfeiture order.        By separate order, we have requested additional\n\nbriefing and oral argument on these issues.\n\n          Separate opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart, follows.\n\n                                      -73-\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\n\nin part.    The majority has skillfully analyzed a number of very\n\ndifficult issues, and I concur in parts II and III of its opinion,\n\nwhich    affirm      Corrente's           and     Autiello's      non-RICO-related\n\nconvictions.       As    to    the   RICO-related      convictions,      I    am   not\n\npersuaded   that     the      majority     correctly       disregards   the   jury's\n\ninterrogatory answers in conducting its sufficiency review, see\n\nante part I-E, or that it has convincingly fended off defendants'\n\nargument that a municipal entity, which is incapable of being found\n\nto have acted with an unlawful purpose, cannot coherently be\n\nregarded as a member of an associated-in-fact RICO enterprise that\n\nis defined by the shared unlawful purposes of its associates, see\n\nante part I-B.     But even if I assume that the jury's interrogatory\n\nanswers are irrelevant and that municipal entities can be named as\n\nassociates of the type of RICO enterprise that was alleged in this\n\ncase, I still must dissent from the majority's conclusion that\n\nthere is sufficient record evidence to sustain defendants' RICO-\n\nrelated convictions.            In my view, the RICO-related judgments\n\n(including the forfeiture judgment) should be reversed and this\n\nmatter should be remanded for resentencing.\n\n            The majority has done an excellent job of summarizing the\n\nrelevant legal principles, the nature of the associated-in-fact\n\nRICO    enterprise      alleged      in    this    case,    and   the   pattern     of\n\nracketeering activity underlying the RICO and RICO conspiracy\n\n\n                                          -74-\n\fallegations.   See ante at 4-10 & 11-13.   I adopt this discussion by\n\nreference and turn to the particulars of the argument I find\n\npersuasive.\n\n          Defendants contest their RICO-related convictions, in\n\npart, on the ground that the evidence introduced at trial in\n\nsupport of the nine alleged schemes was inadequate to establish\n\nthat the schemes were conducted through the amalgam of persons and\n\nentities alleged in the indictment to have constituted the RICO\n\nenterprise.    Defendants premise this argument on an underlying\n\nassertion that there was no proof to ground an inference of a\n\nshared purpose among defendants and all of the municipal entities\n\nnamed as associates of the enterprise -- a required finding (at\n\nleast usually, see ante at 13) if an unlawful criminal association\n\nis to be regarded as a RICO enterprise.    Defendants say that their\n\nposition is bolstered by two “findings” made by the district court\n\nand not contradicted by the government (or at least not clearly\n\nso): (1) \"there is no evidence that the [City] departments and/or\n\nagencies, themselves, shared [the enterprise's] purposes,\" United\n\nStates v. Cianci, 210 F. Supp. 2d 71, 73 (D. R.I. 2002), and (2)\n\n\"none of [defendants'] acts . . . resulted in any significant\n\ndisruption of a Governmental function.\"     Thus, the argument goes,\n\neven if we were to assess the adequacy of the evidence supporting\n\nthe RICO convictions by looking at the whole record and construing\n\nit in favor of the government (despite the nine judgments of\n\n\n\n                                -75-\n\facquittal      entered      by    the    district          court       and     the    special\n\ninterrogatory answers collectively indicating that much of the\n\ngovernment's RICO case was not \"proven\"), we would find only a few,\n\nrelatively inconsequential interactions between the defendants and\n\nthese    municipal       entities    during          the    nearly     eight       years    the\n\nenterprise was alleged to have existed.\n\n              The government's response tracks the grounds on which the\n\ndistrict court rejected the defendants' motions for judgments of\n\nacquittal: (1) we should follow the Ninth Circuit and hold that\n\n\"RICO does not require intentional or 'purposeful' behavior by\n\ncorporations charged as members of an association-in-fact,\" United\n\nStates v. Feldman, 853 F.2d 648, 657 (9th Cir. 1988); and (2) the\n\njury's enterprise finding was sufficiently supported by evidence\n\nthat Cianci        and    Corrente   (Autiello,            who   was    not    a     municipal\n\nemployee, is not mentioned) \"using the Office of the Mayor and the\n\nOffice   of    Director      of   Administration            as   base        camps,    .    .   .\n\ncontrolled\" the municipal entities named as enterprise associates.\n\nThe government's first suggestion, that we reject defendants'\n\nargument      on    the     basis       of     the     Feldman         principle,          faces\n\ninsurmountable obstacles.            This court has identified the \"common\n\npurpose\" requirement discussed in United States v. Turkette, 452\n\nU.S. 576, 580-83 (1981), as one of the principal tools a factfinder\n\nshould use to distinguish a RICO enterprise from an ad hoc criminal\n\nconfederation.       See ante at 13; see also Ryan v. Clemente, 901 F.2d\n\n\n\n                                             -76-\n\f177, 180 (1st Cir. 1990) (emphasizing that the common purpose\n\nrequirement is necessary to \"limit the potentially boundless scope\n\nof the word 'enterprise'\" and thereby \"distinguish culpable, from\n\nnon-culpable,     associations\").17            Indeed,    we    have      applied     the\n\nrequirement    (albeit     without      acknowledging      Feldman)         in   a   case\n\ninvolving an unlawful purpose RICO association-in-fact involving\n\ncorporate legal entities.          See United States v. London, 66 F.3d\n\n1227, 1243-45 (1st Cir. 1995).                 Moreover, and decisively, the\n\ndistrict    court     instructed     the       jury    without      objection        from\n\nthe government: \"[I]t is not necessary in proving the existence of\n\nan   enterprise     to    show   that    each     member       of   the     enterprise\n\nparticipated in or even knew of all of its activities, but it is\n\nnecessary to show that all members of the alleged enterprise shared\n\na common purpose.\"        The government has not attempted to reconcile\n\nFeldman with Turkette, Ryan, London, or our other cases applying\n\nTurkette.     See ante at 13.        Thus, as the majority concedes, we\n\ncannot    disregard      the   common-purpose         instruction      in    analyzing\n\ndefendants' sufficiency challenges.               See ante at 18-19 (citing\n\nUnited States v. Zanghi, 189 F.3d 71, 79-80 (1st Cir. 1999)).                         The\n\n\n\n\n     17\n      Ryan, which was authored by then-Judge Breyer, involved a\ncivil RICO claim, but precedent generated in civil RICO cases\napplies to criminal RICO cases. See United States v. Shifman, 124\nF.3d 31, 35 n.1 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                        -77-\n\fquestion whether Feldman correctly states the law must be left to\n\nanother day.18\n\n                This leaves the government's undeveloped assertion -- an\n\nassertion that the majority finds convincing -- that the jury's\n\nenterprise finding is sustainable because there was evidence that\n\nCianci and Corrente exercised \"control\" over the municipal entities\n\nnamed as members of the enterprise.               Because the common-purpose\n\ninstruction binds for purposes of our analysis, I shall assume that\n\nthe   government      intends     by   this   assertion   to   argue    that    such\n\n\"control\" is sufficient to impute to the entities the unlawful\n\npurposes of those alleged to control them -- i.e., Cianci and\n\nCorrente.        Compare London, 66 F.3d at 1243-45 (involving closely\n\nheld corporations operated by the defendant and alleged to be\n\nmembers of his unlawful associated-in-fact RICO enterprise); United\n\nStates     v.    Masters,   924    F.2d   1362,    1366-67     (7th    Cir.    1991)\n\n(involving a law firm and two police departments associated in fact\n\nwith those who controlled or manipulated them).                   I also shall\n\nassume that it would be fair to sustain the defendants' convictions\n\non evidence of such control, notwithstanding the absence of jury\n\ninstructions explaining that a municipal entity's \"purposes\" may be\n\n\n      18\n      Even under the Feldman approach, the court still would face\nthe question whether entities not controlled by those accused of\noperating the alleged association-in-fact enterprise are properly\nconsidered part of such an enterprise.      For the reasons that\nfollow, I do not think that they are. Thus, my conclusion that the\nFeldman rule does not apply under the facts of this case is not\noutcome determinative.\n\n                                        -78-\n\fso ascertained.      Even so, I do not see how the convictions can\n\nstand.\n\n           In my view, there is no proof that Cianci and Corrente so\n\ncontrolled the activities of all the municipal entities alleged to\n\nbe associates of the charged enterprise that the two’s shared\n\ncriminal purposes are reasonably imputed to each such entity.\n\nThere is   no    evidence    that,   for    example,    Cianci   and    Corrente\n\nthemselves could provide those willing to pay bribes with jobs in\n\nCity departments over which they lacked hiring authority; or that\n\nthey could contractually bind City departments under separate\n\nleadership; or that they could sell City property; or that they\n\ncould grant or deny construction variances. Nor did the government\n\nshow that the persons, committees, and boards within the municipal\n\ndepartments, offices, and agencies whose assistance the schemes\n\nrequired abdicated their decision-making responsibilities to Cianci\n\nor Corrente.19    In short, neither Cianci nor Corrente was shown to\n\nhave so dominated the affairs of the departments, offices, and\n\nagencies   claimed   to     be   associated   with     the   unlawful    purpose\n\nenterprise that each of these municipal entities might fairly be\n\nfound to have been an alter ego of Cianci or Corrente with respect\n\n     19\n      This    statement   is   subject   to   the   following   two\nqualifications. First, the jury could have found that Corrente\nhimself had the ability to dictate which towers were placed on the\npolice department's tow list. Second, the jury could have found\nthat the Board of Tax Assessment Review was effectively controlled\nby Cianci and Corrente through the corrupt machinations of RICO co-\nconspirators Joseph Pannone (BTAR's Chairman) and David Ead (BTAR's\nVice-Chairman).\n\n                                     -79-\n\fto the transactions in question.20 Rather, the evidence showed only\n\nthat Cianci and Corrente periodically used the power inherent in\n\n\n\n\n     20\n      By this statement, I do not mean to imply that those\nmunicipal actors to whom Cianci and Corrente directed their\nsuccessful requests and demands (compare infra note 5) always acted\nwithin standard operating procedures or even lawfully.      To the\ncontrary, as the majority explains it:\n\n          [T]he evidence depicted a behavioral spectrum\n     ranging from innocent cooperation to willful complicity\n     in unlawful conduct. For example, with respect to the\n     Freitas Invoices scheme, the evidence was merely that an\n     employee within the City's Finance Department (Lorraine\n     Lisi), acting at Corrente's request, paid valid invoices\n     more promptly than usual. Similarly, with respect to the\n     Ise Job scheme, the evidence was merely that the Deputy\n     Director of the Department of Planning and Development\n     (Thomas Deller) created a temporary position for Ise\n     within the department at Cianci's request. At the more\n     culpable end of the spectrum, however, there was evidence\n     that, in connection with the Jere Lease scheme, the head\n     of the Department of Public Property (Alan Sepe) and the\n     Director of Business Relations for the School Department\n     (Mark Dunham) were influenced by Corrente to tailor the\n     specifications in a School Department lease bid to fit\n     the dimensions of Jere Realty's building, and then to\n     support the Jere Realty lease before the Board of\n     Contract and Supply (which was the entity formally\n     empowered to accept or reject bids of City contracts).\n     Similarly, in connection with the Freitas Lease scheme,\n     there was evidence that Corrente again contacted Dunham\n     prior to finalization of the lease and influenced him to\n     drop consideration of an alternative lease.\n\nAnte at 20 n.3. But importantly, even in connection with these\nlatter two schemes, Sepe and Dunham were not shown to have known of\nand willingly joined the alleged RICO enterprise conspiracy. Nor\nwas there a basis for finding that a majority of the Board of\nContract and Supply, the entity which ultimately voted to accept\nthe Jere Realty lease, did so for purposes of furthering the\nalleged RICO enterprise conspiracy, or even with knowledge that it\nwas ratifying a contract that had been formed in disregard of\nstandard operating procedures.\n\n                               -80-\n\ftheir      positions     to   influence      (or   attempt     to     influence)21    the\n\ndecisions        of   other   municipal      actors    --    actors    who,   with    the\n\nexceptions noted in the preceding footnote, were not shown to be\n\nprivy      to,    let   alone    supportive      of,   the    alleged     enterprise's\n\npurposes.\n\n                 The question arises why this evidence of influence is not\n\nsufficient to make the persons and entities influenced part of the\n\nalleged enterprise.           The answer, I believe, lies in the fact that\n\nwe   are    here      deciding   what   is    required       for    membership   in    an\n\nassociated-in-fact RICO enterprise defined only by the common\n\n\n      21\n      The majority acknowledges that Cianci and Corrente \"did not\nalways get their way . . . .\" Ante at 24. As the majority notes,\nthere was uncontradicted evidence that, in connection with the\nFreitas Lots scheme, Cianci was displeased that elements within the\nProvidence Redevelopment Agency, the entity empowered to sell the\nlots, did not sufficiently accede to his wishes.      See id. n.7.\nThere also was uncontradicted evidence that, in connection with the\nUniversity Club scheme, Cianci was angered when members of the\nProvidence Building Board of Review ignored his wishes and granted\nthe club some of the variances that it sought. See id. Finally,\nthere was uncontradicted evidence that, in connection with the\nMaggiacomo Job scheme, the Chief of Police declined to admit\nMaggiacomo to the police academy because he had a criminal history\nand had been untruthful during a screening interview. See id.\n     The majority suggests that this evidence \"does not defeat the\nintegrity of the charged enterprise\" because the jury could have\nconcluded that \"these glitches in the schemes only meant that\ncertain substantive crimes went uncompleted . . . .\" Id. With\nrespect, I think that the evidence is more telling on the point in\nquestion -- whether there was sufficient evidence that Cianci and\nCorrente so controlled the Providence Redevelopment Agency, the\nProvidence Building Board of Review, and the Department of Public\nSafety that their unlawful purposes should be imputed to these\nentities -- than the majority acknowledges. There was, after all\n(and as the majority concedes, see ante at 17), no other evidence\nfrom which the jury might have found that defendants controlled\nthese agencies (or at least relevantly so).\n\n                                          -81-\n\funlawful purposes of its members.             This is a highly ramified\n\ndecision with implications, criminal and civil, that extend far\n\nbeyond this case.       Were we to permit a person or entity to be named\n\npart of an unlawful purpose enterprise on mere evidence that the\n\nperson or entity acceded to a mobster's request (but without\n\nknowledge of the purposes underlying the request), we would be\n\nheading down the slippery slope against which then-Judge Breyer\n\nwarned     in   Ryan:   that   of   failing   to   differentiate   between\n\nassociations that fall within the sweep of RICO and associations\n\ninvolving only the exploitation of others by criminals.            See 901\n\nF.2d at 180-81 (emphasizing the need to limit \"the potentially\n\nboundless scope of the word 'enterprise' so as to distinguish\n\nculpable from non-culpable associations,\" and recognizing \"the\n\nserious consequences for any man or woman, state official or\n\nprivate person, who is publicly accused of racketeering\"); see\n\nalso Fitzgerald v. Chrysler Corp., 116 F.3d 225, 226-28 (7th Cir.\n\n1997).22    As Ryan suggests, membership in an unlawful purpose RICO\n\n\n     22\n      To illustrate, suppose there was evidence that a young law\nschool graduate made a $5,000 \"campaign contribution\" to Cianci and\nasked for a recommendation to the hiring partner of a Providence\nlaw firm that does a substantial amount of city business. Suppose\nfurther that there was evidence that Cianci called the firm's\nhiring partner and asked that the firm give serious consideration\nto hiring the young lawyer. If the firm did so, would it become a\nmember of the common purpose enterprise alleged in this case? If\nthe answer is \"no\" (as I think it clearly should be), on what\nprincipled basis can we find that the Department of Planning and\nDevelopment -- the agency that created a temporary position for\nChristopher Ise at the request of Cianci -- was proved to be part\nof the enterprise?\n\n                                    -82-\n\fenterprise implies potential culpability under the RICO statute.\n\nSee 901 F.2d at 181; see also 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) (allowing for the\n\nimposition of RICO liability under conspiracy principles).             Thus,\n\nas a matter of logic (not to mention due process), one who lacks\n\nthe mental state necessary for the imposition of RICO liability\n\nbecause he is unaware of the enterprise or its purposes also lacks\n\nthe mental state necessary to be part of a RICO enterprise that is\n\ndefined solely by the shared, culpable mental state of its members.\n\nThis is   ultimately   what,   in   my     view,   dooms   the   government's\n\nenterprise allegations in this case.\n\n          There was in this case significant evidence of public\n\ncorruption.    Perhaps the government could have proved that Cianci\n\nand Corrente ran the Office of the Mayor or the Office of the\n\nDirector of Administration as a RICO enterprise.             Or perhaps the\n\ndefendants (or, more likely, a subset thereof) might have been\n\nshown to be members of one or more smaller, associated-in-fact RICO\n\nenterprises.   But the government successfully persuaded the grand\n\njury to cast a wider net and to allege that the persons named as\n\nenterprise associates, along with the campaign contribution fund,\n\nthe City of Providence, and many of its departments, offices and\n\nagencies, functioned as a de facto organized crime syndicate.\n\nFraming the case in this way permitted the government to allege\n\nthat defendants were responsible under RICO's conspiracy provision\n\nfor all of the illegal and unethical conduct put on display in this\n\n\n\n                                    -83-\n\ftrial -- even that in which they were not shown to have personally\n\nparticipated.23 But this broad case theory obligated the government\n\nto prove that each municipal entity alleged to have engaged in\n\nconduct that constituted part of the \"pattern of racketeering\n\nactivity\" identified in the indictment was itself a member of the\n\nenterprise.   As another court has put it:\n\n          [I]t must be stressed that the government,\n          through its ability to craft indictments, is\n          the master of the scope of the charged RICO\n          conspiracy . . . . [RICO's conspiracy\n          provision] is capable of providing for the\n          linkage in one proceeding of a number of\n          otherwise distinct crimes and/or conspiracies\n          through the concept of enterprise conspiracy.\n          The government, through the vehicle of the\n          indictment,      provides      the    linking\n          conspiratorial objective of a specific RICO\n          violation.   The \"specific\" violation can be\n          broad or narrow. It is the prosecution which\n          sets the parameters to which a RICO conspiracy\n          trial must be confined; having set the stage,\n          the government must be satisfied with the\n          limits of its own creation.\n\nUnited States v. Weissman, 899 F.2d 1111, 1115 (11th Cir. 1990)\n\n(quoting United States v. Neapolitan, 791 F.2d 489, 501 (7th Cir.\n\n1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original).\n\n\n\n\n     23\n      For example, Autiello was responsible under RICO for the\nunlawful conduct underlying the Freitas Lease and Freitas Invoice\nschemes -- schemes on which the jury returned substantive\nconvictions but in which he was not involved -- on the theory that\nhe was a member of a conspiracy to conduct the enterprise that\ncarried out these schemes.\n\n                               -84-\n\f            RICO is a powerful weapon that can cause mischief if\n\nabused by an overzealous prosecutor.24           While I do not doubt that\n\nRICO will sometimes apply in cases of political corruption, I fear\n\nthe consequences of making the statute too easy to invoke -- or too\n\neasy to apply broadly -- in the political context, where persons\n\nwho have made a contribution to a politician routinely receive\n\nfavorable   treatment   from   offices     or    agencies     over   which    the\n\npolitician has influence.      I therefore agree with Justice Breyer\n\nthat we must place comprehensible limits on RICO's reach and that\n\nan important way of cabining the statute is to require true\n\nculpability before one may be named part of an associated-in-fact\n\nRICO enterprise defined by the common unlawful purposes of its\n\nconstituents.     See Ryan, 901 F.2d at 180-81.           Such a limitation\n\nhelps to ensure that cases involving claims of political corruption\n\nwill not also inevitably give rise to a RICO charge, and that cases\n\ninvolving   multiple    acts   of   common      law   fraud   will   not     also\n\ninevitably give rise to civil liability under the statute.\n\n            In this case, the government proved only that many of the\n\nmunicipal entities named in the indictment were used as tools by\n\ndefendants.     For reasons I have explained, this is not enough to\n\nprove that these entities were part of a RICO enterprise defined\n\n\n     24\n      I am speaking generally here and in no way intend to impugn\nthose who brought this case.

The Remaining Convictions\n\n          A.   Federal Bribery Conspiracy (Autiello)\n\n          Autiello argues that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport his conviction for federal bribery conspiracy in connection\n\nwith the Maggiacomo Job scheme.   Autiello contends that, because\n\nthere was no direct evidence about either the identity of his co-\n\nconspirator or the fate of the $5,000 Mary Maggiacomo paid him, the\n\nevidence gave nearly equal circumstantial support to an inference\n\nthat he pocketed the money as a payment for his efforts with the\n\npolice department (with which he had influence) on behalf of Joseph\n\nMaggiacomo as it did to an inference that he passed the bribe along\n\nto some public official, or at least conspired to do so.       See\n\nUnited States v. Andujar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195947\"><a href=\"/opinion/195947/united-states-v-andujar/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"If the\n\nevidence viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution\n\ngives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of\n\nguilty and a theory of innocence of the crime charged, this court\n\nmust reverse the conviction.\") (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).   The argument is unconvincing.\n\n          There was evidence that, during a face-to-face meeting in\n\nwhich his favorable intercessions were sought, Autiello told Mary\n\nMaggiacomo and her husband that Providence police officer positions\n\nwere prized and that Joseph Maggiacomo's chances were not good\n\nbecause the Maggiacomos were not Providence taxpayers and had not\n\nmade any \"contributions.\" In nearly the same breath, Autiello told\n\n\n                               -50-\n\fthem that, if they wanted Joseph to be accepted into the police\n\nacademy, they would have to come up with $5,000 in cash.       The\n\njuxtaposition of these two comments, combined with the evidence\n\nthat Autiello himself held no authority to make police academy\n\nadmission decisions, permitted a reasonable inference that the\n\n$5,000 was to be a political \"contribution\" that would serve as\n\nJoseph's ticket of admission when passed along to someone with\n\nauthority over academy admission decisions.\n\n          B.   Hobbs Act Attempted Extortion and\n          Extortion Conspiracy (Corrente)\n\n          Corrente makes three arguments in favor of reversing or\n\nvacating his convictions for Hobbs Act attempted extortion and\n\nHobbs Act extortion conspiracy in connection with the Freitas Lease\n\nand Freitas Invoices schemes: (1) there was insufficient evidence\n\nthat these schemes had the constitutionally required impact on\n\ninterstate commerce; (2) there was insufficient evidence that he\n\naffirmatively acted in such a way as to be fairly accused of having\n\nattempted or conspired to engage in extortion; and (3) the district\n\ncourt's jury instructions erroneously described what was required\n\nto establish an attempt or conspiracy to engage in extortion.\n\nThere is some question whether each of these arguments was made\n\nbelow as to each of the three convictions, but we bypass issues of\n\nforfeiture because none of the arguments is persuasive on its\n\nmerits.\n\n\n\n                               -51-\n\f           Corrente's      first    argument   is    largely    based     on    an\n\nassertion that his convictions are unconstitutional because his\n\noffense conduct had to, but did not, have more than a de minimis\n\neffect on interstate commerce in order to jibe with the Supreme\n\nCourt's decisions in United States v.

He is wrong.\n\n            With   respect    to    Corrente's      attempted   extortion       in\n\nconnection with the Freitas Lease scheme, the jury could have found\n\nthat, but for Freitas' agreement to pay Corrente for favorable\n\nintervention on his behalf with the school department, there was a\n\nrealistic probability that the City contractor (an entity engaged\n\nin   interstate    commerce   and    whose   lease    agreement   would    be    a\n\ntransaction affecting interstate commerce12) would have leased space\n\nin   Cranston,     Rhode   Island.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992).                    Evans\n\ninterpreted the provision of the Hobbs Act under which Corrente was\n\nconvicted    --   one   which   prohibits      extortion   by    means    of    \"the\n\nobtaining of property from another, with his consent, . . .

See Corrente Br. at 49.            To the\n\nextent that he is so arguing, Corrente acknowledges that we are\n\npowerless to grant him relief and that he must go to the Supreme\n\nCourt.     Id.\n\n            There are hints of other arguments in Corrente's brief,\n\nbut none is sufficiently developed to warrant consideration on the\n\nmerits.     See United States v.

In any event, our review of the record convinces us that\n\nthere is no basis for reversing or vacating Corrente's attempted\n\nextortion and extortion conspiracy convictions.\n\n\n                                       -54-\n\f               Any sufficiency challenge is doomed because there was\n\nsufficient evidence to support the convictions even under the more\n\ndemanding interpretation of the Hobbs Act for which Corrente\n\nadvocates.       With respect to the Freitas Lease scheme, the jury\n\ncould have found that Corrente \"induced\" payments from Freitas\n\nwhen, at one point prior to receiving any money related to this\n\nscheme, he suggested to Freitas that City Hall could either hurt or\n\nhelp his chances of securing the lease (depending, presumably, on\n\nwhether Freitas anted up).          With respect to the Freitas Invoices\n\nscheme, the jury could have found that Pannone, Corrente's co-\n\nconspirator, induced payments on Corrente's behalf by encouraging\n\nFreitas to \"throw something\" at Corrente – i.e., to \"pay to get\n\npaid.\"\n\n               So too with the jury instructions.        As clarified in a\n\nsupplemental charge just prior to the return of the verdicts, the\n\ninstructions on the attempted extortion and extortion conspiracy\n\ncharges were, if anything, overly generous to Corrente.                     And\n\nbecause the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions even\n\nunder    the    arguably    too   lenient    instructions,    any   error   was\n\nharmless.      See Fed. R. Crim.

They also argue that the court erred in\n\nprecluding them from interposing objections to the admission of\n\nthese tape recordings for their failure to abide by a procedural\n\norder requiring that Rule 403 and 404(b) objections be identified\n\nwith specificity in advance of trial.\n\n             A.

In determining\n\nwhether the Government has met Rule 801(d)(2)(E) prerequisites, the\n\ndistrict court must determine that it is \"more likely than not that\n\nthe declarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy when\n\nthe hearsay statement was made, and that the statement was in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.\" United States v. Petrozziello, 548\n\n\n\n\n       13\n      “A statement is not hearsay if . . . [t]he statement is\noffered against the party[-opponent] and is . . . a statement by a\ncoconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of\nthe conspiracy.” Fed. R.

We refer to this determination as a\n\n“Petrozziello ruling.”      Geronimo, 330 F.3d at 75.\n\n            Defendants contend that there was \"scanty\" evidence of a\n\nconspiracy among defendants and Pannone. They argue that Pannone's\n\ntaped   statements   were    unreliable       and   there   was   insufficient\n\nextrinsic   evidence   of    the    conspiracies      because     some   of   the\n\nconversations on the tape were \"rambling and unfocused\" and not all\n\nof the defendants were ultimately convicted as part of the three\n\nracketeering acts--the Ronci Estate, Freitas Lease, and Freitas\n\nInvoices schemes--of which Pannone had first-hand knowledge.\n\n            We disagree.    As we have detailed supra, the government\n\npresented sufficient evidence of a RICO conspiracy--conspiracy,\n\nenterprise, and pattern of racketeering activity–-to satisfy the\n\nevidentiary standard set forth in Petrozziello.             In particular, on\n\ntape, Corrente intimated to Freitas with respect to the Freitas\n\nLease   scheme,   \"Don't    get    involved    with   Joe   unless   something\n\nhappens.\"    Corrente also admits on tape to receiving cash from\n\nPannone in connection with the Pay-to-Get-Paid scheme.                   Pannone\n\nchaired the Board of Tax Assessment Review, a municipal office\n\nwhich we have already detailed to be crucial to the conspiracy.\n\nBoth Freitas and Ead testified at trial to Pannone’s involvement in\n\nthe Ronci Estate, Freitas Lease, and Pay-to-Get Paid schemes. With\n\nregard to the Ronci Estate scheme, the evidence showed a sub-\n\nconspiracy among Cianci, Corrente, and Pannone to extort money from\n\n\n                                     -57-\n\fthe Ronci estate in exchange for a reduction of back taxes owed to\n\nthe City and the assessment of property owned by the estate.               At\n\nthe times the taped statements were made, the evidence also shows\n\na conspiracy between at least Corrente and Pannone to extort money\n\nfrom Tony Freitas and JKL Engineering in exchange for assistance in\n\nleasing property owned by Freitas to the City or to the Marriott\n\nCorporation.        Third, the evidence was sufficient to establish a\n\nconspiracy between at least Corrente and Pannone to extort money\n\nfrom Freitas and JKL in exchange for facilitating payments due from\n\nthe City to JKL.\n\n              Pannone’s taped statements were not made “after the\n\nfact,” but were uttered as part of and in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.     In these statements, Pannone described the roles that\n\nhe, Cianci, Corrente, and Ead played in the conspiracy and in\n\nparticular, what he and Freitas should do to carry out the Freitas\n\nLease and Pay-to-Get-Paid schemes.

United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 183-84 (1987).\n\n            Defendants      argue        that    notwithstanding       Inadi       and\n\nBourjaily, Pannone's statements should not have been admitted\n\nbecause he was unavailable and unreliable.                 They assert that the\n\npresent case is anomalous and that \"corruption stings\" such as this\n\none should not fall within Inadi and Bourjaily.                   We find no case\n\nlaw   excepting    the    case    from    the    Inadi    and    Bourjaily    rules.\n\nDefendants further suggest that Pannone was outside of his \"natural\n\nhabitat\" because Freitas was eliciting incriminating statements\n\nfrom him as part of his cooperation with the FBI.                           Pannone,\n\n\n                                         -59-\n\fhowever, was unaware that he was being stung.   We see no reason how\n\nhis behavior would have been different had Freitas been making the\n\nsame conversation without the FBI’s direction.\n\n          To further address defendants’ contention that Pannone’s\n\nstatements are inherently unreliable, we agree with the district\n\ncourt that Pannone “did have or was in a position to have firsthand\n\nknowledge of some of the things that he testified about.”    He was\n\nan insider to the conspiracy.   Again, he was directly involved and\n\neven played a supervisory role in the Ronci Estate, Freitas Lease,\n\nand Freitas Invoices schemes.      Trial testimony by Ead, Rocha,\n\nFreitas, and others corroborated Pannone’s taped statements setting\n\nout how Corrente was often the middleman in the racket, that Cianci\n\nused Corrente as a buffer, and that money given to Corrente found\n\nits way into the campaign and eventually benefitted Cianci or the\n\nadministration in some way.     Taped conversations between Freitas\n\nand Corrente confirmed the same.\n\n          The government questions Cianci and Corrente's motive for\n\nfailing to call Pannone as a witness for cross-examination as Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 806 permits.   Cianci and Corrente repeatedly contend that\n\nPannone was unavailable to them because he would assert his Fifth\n\nAmendment rights against self-incrimination if called to testify.\n\nThey claim that Pannone’s behavior was \"orchestrated\" by the\n\nGovernment in their plea arrangements with him.\n\n\n\n\n                                -60-\n\f            This alleged \"attempt to thwart cross-examination\" forms\n\nthe basis of defendants’ Fifth Amendment due process claim.                           The\n\nprocedural travel of the case, however, reveals little to support\n\nthis accusation.        The indictment in this case originally named\n\nPannone as a defendant on Counts 1, 2, 8, 9, 16-19, and 21-24.                         On\n\nFebruary 14, 2002, he signed a plea agreement in which he agreed to\n\nplead guilty to Counts 1, 2, 8, 16, 19, and 22.                      The government\n\nagreed to dismiss the remaining counts at sentencing.                              Hence,\n\ndismissal of the remaining charges against Pannone was contingent\n\nupon sentencing.\n\n            On     April    16,     2002,   during      a    hearing      to    resolve\n\ndefendants’      motion     to    exclude      the    Pannone     tapes,       Corrente\n\ncomplained that Pannone’s plea agreement had “left open” the\n\nremaining     counts,       suggesting      that      Pannone’s      fear       of    the\n\ngovernment’s handling of the remaining counts would cause him to\n\nassert his Fifth Amendment rights if he were called by the defense\n\nto testify.      The court, though ultimately rejecting defendants’\n\nlegal arguments, assured them that it would try to accelerate\n\nPannone’s sentencing, which at that time had been scheduled for\n\nJuly.\n\n            Thereafter,       the    district        court   moved     up      Pannone’s\n\nsentencing    in    order    to     accommodate      defendants      in     this     case.\n\nPannone was sentenced on May 24, 2002, while the government was\n\nstill presenting its case-in-chief and almost two weeks before the\n\n\n                                        -61-\n\fdefense presented their own case.       Immediately after sentencing,\n\nthe government moved to dismiss the remaining counts against\n\nPannone; the court granted the motion.      During a bench conference\n\nfour days after Pannone’s sentencing, Corrente’s counsel briefly\n\nremarked that he had been informed by Pannone’s counsel that\n\nPannone would persist in his Fifth Amendment claim “because of a\n\nvariety of reasons which I won’t go into right now.”     Nothing more\n\nwas made of these “reasons.”\n\n            After this point, defendants did not attempt to call\n\nPannone as a witness.    We find no evidence that Pannone would have\n\ninvoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if\n\ncalled to testify, and whether the court would have permitted him\n\nto do so.   There simply is no evidence of an \"orchestration\" by the\n\ngovernment to keep Pannone away from defendants.     Thus, there were\n\nno constitutional infringements here.14\n\n            C.   Rules 403 and 404(b)\n\n            Finally, with respect to the Pannone tapes, defendants\n\nargue that the district court erred by failing to consider their\n\nobjections to admission of the tapes under Fed. R. Evid. 40315 and\n\n\n     14\n      To the extent that defendants’ due process claim incorporates\ntheir argument that Pannone’s statements are unreliable, our\naffirmance of the district court’s Petrozziello ruling sufficiently\nresponds to that claim.\n     15\n      “Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\nprejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\nconsiderations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless\n\n                                 -62-\n\f404(b).16       They claim that they made timely objections pre-trial.\n\nThey further recount that the court decided not to address the\n\nobjections prior to trial, but then mistakenly at trial ruled that\n\ndefendants waived their right to object to admission of the tapes.\n\n               We first recount the procedural history giving rise to\n\nthis issue.          On April 24, 2001, the government provided defendants\n\nwith        copies    of   the   two   hundred   tapes   relating   to   their\n\ninvestigation of defendants, along with an index showing the dates\n\nof the recordings and the conversation participants.                Three days\n\nlater, the court issued an Arraignment and Pre-trial Discovery\n\nOrder, whereby the government was ordered to provide the defendants\n\nwith transcripts of the tapes.            The court also ordered that all\n\npre-trial motions be filed by December 31, 2001.\n\n               The government eliminated all but twenty-two tapes as\n\npossible trial exhibits.          By October 31, 2001 –- two months before\n\nthe deadline for pre-trial motions and six months before the\n\n\n\n\npresentation of cumulative evidence.”            Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n       16\n      “Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts–Evidence of other crimes,\nwrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a\nperson in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may,\nhowever, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive,\nopportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or\nabsence of mistake or accident, provided that upon request by the\naccused, the prosecution in a criminal case shall provide\nreasonable notice in advance of trial, or during trial if the court\nexcuses pre-trial notice on good cause shown, of the general nature\nof any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.” Fed. R.\nEvid. 404(b).\n\n                                        -63-\n\fcommencement of trial –- the government had provided transcripts of\n\nthese twenty-two tapes to defendants.\n\n              On March 28, 2002, the district court issued a Pre-trial\n\nScheduling Order, which read:\n\n              On or before April 12, 2002, counsel for any\n              party    disputing     the    audibility    of\n              admissibility of any such recording or the\n              accuracy of any such transcript of any such\n              transcript shall file an objection identifying\n              the recording to which objection is being\n              made. Memoranda in support of objections to\n              the accuracy or completeness of transcripts\n              shall be accompanied by copies of the\n              transcripts objected to on which proposed\n              deletions and corrections are noted.\n              In offering recorded conversations, counsel\n              shall make every effort to edit out footage\n              that contains no audible discussion or\n              contains irrelevant material so that the jury\n              will not be required to listen for protracted\n              periods of time to portions of recordings that\n              provide little or no assistance in determining\n              the pertinent facts. In order to achieve that\n              objective, counsel shall meet and confer, in\n              advance, in an effort to resolve any disputes\n              with respect to editing.\n\n              . . . Failure to comply with the provisions of\n              this paragraph may be considered as a waiver,\n              by the proponent, of the right to offer the\n              recorded    conversation(s)   at   issue;   or,\n              alternatively, as a waiver of the right to\n              object    to    omission   of    the   recorded\n              conversation(s) and/or dispute the accuracy or\n              completeness of the transcript, as the case\n              may be.\n\n              On April 8, 2002, defendants filed a motion objecting to\n\nthe admission of the Pannone tapes.               They based their motion\n\nprimarily on Petrozziello and constitutional grounds, and mentioned\n\nRules   403    and   404   in   a   general   observation   that   “any   given\n\n                                       -64-\n\fstatement may also be inadmissible” under those rules.                They did\n\nnot   identify    which    statements    were   inadmissible,   but    instead\n\nsuggested that the court itself should “go through” the tapes\n\n“line-by-line, making individual assessments as to each declarative\n\nstatement.”      Defendants stated that they would provide the court\n\nwith a schedule identifying offending statements and detailing the\n\nbases for their exclusion.        They never provided this schedule.\n\n           At the April 16 hearing on the motion, defendants again\n\nfocused   on     Petrozziello      and    the   constitutional    theories.\n\nCorrente’s counsel acknowledged that the government had edited the\n\ntapes to deal with Rule 403 concerns.           Nothing more was said with\n\nregard to either 403 or 404.             The court denied the motion to\n\nsuppress the Pannone statements and refused to undertake the line-\n\nby-line analysis, explaining that it “would take easily, . . .\n\nweeks . . . and it would delay the trial by that period of time.”\n\nThe court expressed its plan to “minimize the risk of a mistrial in\n\nthe event that statements are presented that later are found not\n\nsatisfy the requirements” by requiring the government to present\n\n“additional evidence above and beyond the statements themselves to\n\nsupport a finding that they qualify as admissible co-conspirator\n\nstatements.”\n\n           On April 24, the second day of trial, the government in-\n\nchambers mentioned that defendants had failed to propose cuts to\n\nthe Pannone tapes.        In response to Corrente’s counsel’s suggestion\n\n\n                                     -65-\n\fthat the defense would later in the trial move to excise other\n\ntaped statements pursuant to Rules 403 and 404, the court stated\n\nthat such motions “should have been done long ago.”\n\n           Throughout trial, the court repeated that proposals for\n\ncuts to the tapes had been due by April 12, 2002, pursuant to its\n\nPre-trial Scheduling Order. Upon challenges at trial by defendants\n\nto the admissibility of individual tapes, the court stated that\n\nthey could not make these objections because they had failed to\n\ntender such an objection pre-trial.\n\n           Defendants argue that they complied with the pre-trial\n\nscheduling     order       because      they    timely   filed     \"an     objection\n\nidentifying the recording to which objection is being made\" as\n\nrequired by the Pre-trial Scheduling Order.              However, they fail to\n\nmention that the order also mandates that \"[m]emoranda in support\n\nof   objections    .   .    .   shall    be    accompanied    by   copies    of    the\n\ntranscripts objected to on which proposed deletions and corrections\n\nare noted.\"    Defendants failed to provide the district court with\n\nthese specific objections.           The supplemental schedule promised by\n\ndefendants never materialized; the schedule, moreover, was not an\n\n“extra” offer, but explicitly required by the order as part of any\n\nobjection to the tapes.          The district court declined to perform a\n\nline-by-line      assessment      of     the    transcripts      because    it    had\n\nspecifically provided in the order that the parties do it.                       After\n\nrepeated general       objections        non-compliant    with     the   procedural\n\n\n                                         -66-\n\forder, the court decided that the defendants waived their right to\n\nobject pursuant to the order.         It did not abuse its discretion in\n\nrefusing to entertain piecemeal objections to evidence in the\n\nPannone tapes.\n\n            Regardless, admission of the taped statements--which\n\ndefendants    still      have   failed    to    itemize--did      not    prejudice\n\ndefendants.      As   we   have   explained      supra,   the    government     has\n\nproduced    sufficient     evidence      of    the   tapes’     reliability     and\n\nprobative value.         Moreover, the court followed through on its\n\nassurance that it would “minimize the risk” of improper admission\n\nby requiring the government to produce evidence corroborative of\n\nstatements made in the tapes.\n\n            We stress that the court wisely recognized that stop-and-\n\ngo evidentiary evaluations of these tapes during trial would unduly\n\ndelay the case and perhaps even cause the very prejudice and\n\nconfusion that defendants contemplated in their general objection.\n\nAccordingly, the court fashioned a system well before trial through\n\nwhich it expected both parties to whittle down the tapes to their\n\nrelevant portions.

An\n\nimportant    part   of   this   system    was    for   defendants       to   produce\n\n\n                                      -67-\n\ftranscripts of the tapes denoting which portions they wished to\n\nredact out of Rule 403, Rule 404, constitutional, or Petrozziello\n\nconcerns.        Even   in   their   appeal,   defendants   persist   in   the\n\nambiguity of their objection to the tapes. Other circuits have not\n\ntolerated this type of objection.              See, e.g., United States v.\n\nHolland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526802\"><a href=\"/opinion/526802/united-states-v-eddie-holland-united-states-of-america-v-david-helmecy/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1091</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1094-95 (9th Cir. 1989) (where some parts\n\nof audiotape were admissible but “much of the tape was irrelevant,”\n\nthe defendant’s “blanket objection to the admission of the tape\n\ndoes not preserve an objection to failure to redact the tape”).            We\n\nfind no abuse in the district court’s exercise of its broad\n\ndiscretion over Rule 403 and 404 considerations.\n\nV.   Cianci’s Taped Statement\n\n            A.     Hearsay\n\n            In 1995, a government agent posing as an air conditioning\n\nbusinessman taped his conversation with Cianci when he requested a\n\ncity contract.     Cianci assured the agent that he would refer him to\n\nAlan Sepe, who Cianci believed knew more about air conditioning\n\nmatters than he did.         Cianci then told the agent, \"[Sepe] is honest\n\nas the day is long.      He deals in governments and ____.      No one will\n\nask you for a thing.          If anybody does, you pick up the phone and\n\ncall me.    I'll cut his ____ off and have him arrested, okay?\"            The\n\nagent had said or done nothing to prompt discussion of corruption.\n\nThen, Cianci, in introducing the agent to an unidentified man,\n\nremarked, \"He's probably an FBI agent.\"\n\n\n                                      -68-\n\f          The   district   court    refused    to   admit   this    tape   on\n\nrelevancy grounds, holding that the conversation in it “does not\n\nrelate to any predicate act or to any specific matter with respect\n\nto which the Government has presented any evidence.”          In response\n\nto Cianci’s argument that the statements were admissible under the\n\n“state of mind” exception to the hearsay rule, see Fed. R. Evid.\n\n803(3), the court concluded, “This statement or the import of the\n\nstatement is to show what Mr. Cianci did or didn’t do on other\n\noccasions with respect to unrelated matters, so therefore it does\n\nnot fall under the exception to the hearsay rule created by Rule\n\n803(3) for state of mind existing at the time of the event in\n\nquestion.”   Cianci argues that the district court's refusal to\n\nadmit this taped statement in evidence was an abuse of discretion\n\nand violated his right to due process.        Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co.\n\nof North America, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197080\"><a href=\"/opinion/197080/colasanto-v-life-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 213 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          The   district   court    deemed    Cianci’s   taped     statement\n\nirrelevant because it did \"not relate to any predicate act or to\n\nany specific matter with respect to which the Government has\n\npresented any evidence.\"    Cianci argues that the court failed to\n\nrecognize the statement’s relevance to the RICO charges in general.\n\nHe asserts that the statement tends to make the existence of the\n\nenterprise less likely than without the statement, Fed. R. Evid.\n\n401, and that the court “conflat[ed] the provisions of Rule 803(3)\n\n. . . with the relevancy requirements of Rule 401.”\n\n\n                                   -69-\n\f           Cianci recapitulates that if the statement in the tape is\n\nhearsay, it falls within the state of mind exception to the hearsay\n\nrule.     Fed. R. Evid. 803(3).             “To be admissible under this\n\nexception, a declaration, among other things, must 'mirror a state\n\nof mind, which, in light of all the circumstances, including\n\nproximity in time, is reasonably likely to have been the same\n\ncondition existing at the material time.’”              Colasanto, 100 F.3d at\n\n212 (quoting 2 John W. Strong, McCormick on Evidence § 274 (4th ed.\n\n1992)).      Cianci      contends     that       the    statement        evinces     a\n\ncontemporaneous      intent    not         to    endorse       bribery     in      his\n\nadministration, rather than a statement denying past instances of\n\ncorrupt acts.      In    addition     to    adopting    the     district    court’s\n\nconclusion that the statement evinced a “state of mind” as to\n\nevents or behavior on other occasions, the government argues that\n\nCianci's statements were self-serving, and hence outside the ambit\n\nof Rule 803(3), because he knew that he was talking to a federal\n\nagent.\n\n           As an initial matter, the taped statement is hearsay.\n\nCianci offered it to prove the truth of the assertion that Cianci\n\ndid not   tolerate      corruption.        Another     thing    is   certain:      the\n\nstatement was not admissible in order to show what Cianci might\n\nhave done or not done on other occasions not proximate to the time\n\nthe   statement   was    uttered.      The      only   purpose    for    which     the\n\nstatement could have been admitted would have been to establish\n\n\n                                      -70-\n\fCianci's state of mind at the time the statement was made.          Because\n\n\"disputes over whether particular statements come within the state-\n\nof-mind exception are fact-sensitive, the trial court is in the\n\nbest position to resolve them.\"      Colasanto, 100 F.3d at 212.       That\n\nthe statement was made at one point during the time of charged\n\nconspiracy   cannot    be   sufficient    to   mandate   its    admission,\n\nespecially where the latter part of the statement--“He's probably\n\nan FBI agent\"--places doubt on what Cianci claims is the probative\n\nvalue and relevance of the statement as a whole.         Whether Cianci’s\n\nstatement is “forward-looking” or refers to past acts and events is\n\nunclear   from   the   statement   itself.      Ths   issue    is   further\n\ncomplicated by the fact that Cianci’s mention of pay-offs was\n\n“gratuitous” and not provoked by anything the agent said or did.\n\nHence, it was within the district court’s discretion to conclude\n\nthat the statement, at least in part, applied to past acts of the\n\nCianci administration and were to a large extent “self-serving”\n\nattempts to cover tracks already made.           Such observations are\n\nwell-established grounds for non-admission.           See, e.g., United\n\nStates v.

By separate order, we have requested additional\n\nbriefing and oral argument on these issues.\n\n          Separate opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart, follows.\n\n                                      -73-\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\n\nin part.    The majority has skillfully analyzed a number of very\n\ndifficult issues, and I concur in parts II and III of its opinion,\n\nwhich    affirm      Corrente's           and     Autiello's      non-RICO-related\n\nconvictions.       As    to    the   RICO-related      convictions,      I    am   not\n\npersuaded   that     the      majority     correctly       disregards   the   jury's\n\ninterrogatory answers in conducting its sufficiency review, see\n\nante part I-E, or that it has convincingly fended off defendants'\n\nargument that a municipal entity, which is incapable of being found\n\nto have acted with an unlawful purpose, cannot coherently be\n\nregarded as a member of an associated-in-fact RICO enterprise that\n\nis defined by the shared unlawful purposes of its associates, see\n\nante part I-B.     But even if I assume that the jury's interrogatory\n\nanswers are irrelevant and that municipal entities can be named as\n\nassociates of the type of RICO enterprise that was alleged in this\n\ncase, I still must dissent from the majority's conclusion that\n\nthere is sufficient record evidence to sustain defendants' RICO-\n\nrelated convictions.            In my view, the RICO-related judgments\n\n(including the forfeiture judgment) should be reversed and this\n\nmatter should be remanded for resentencing.\n\n            The majority has done an excellent job of summarizing the\n\nrelevant legal principles, the nature of the associated-in-fact\n\nRICO    enterprise      alleged      in    this    case,    and   the   pattern     of\n\nracketeering activity underlying the RICO and RICO conspiracy\n\n\n                                          -74-\n\fallegations.   See ante at 4-10 & 11-13.   I adopt this discussion by\n\nreference and turn to the particulars of the argument I find\n\npersuasive.\n\n          Defendants contest their RICO-related convictions, in\n\npart, on the ground that the evidence introduced at trial in\n\nsupport of the nine alleged schemes was inadequate to establish\n\nthat the schemes were conducted through the amalgam of persons and\n\nentities alleged in the indictment to have constituted the RICO\n\nenterprise.    Defendants premise this argument on an underlying\n\nassertion that there was no proof to ground an inference of a\n\nshared purpose among defendants and all of the municipal entities\n\nnamed as associates of the enterprise -- a required finding (at\n\nleast usually, see ante at 13) if an unlawful criminal association\n\nis to be regarded as a RICO enterprise.    Defendants say that their\n\nposition is bolstered by two “findings” made by the district court\n\nand not contradicted by the government (or at least not clearly\n\nso): (1) \"there is no evidence that the [City] departments and/or\n\nagencies, themselves, shared [the enterprise's] purposes,\" United\n\nStates v.

R.I. 2002), and (2)\n\n\"none of [defendants'] acts . . . resulted in any significant\n\ndisruption of a Governmental function.\"     Thus, the argument goes,\n\neven if we were to assess the adequacy of the evidence supporting\n\nthe RICO convictions by looking at the whole record and construing\n\nit in favor of the government (despite the nine judgments of\n\n\n\n                                -75-\n\facquittal      entered      by    the    district          court       and     the    special\n\ninterrogatory answers collectively indicating that much of the\n\ngovernment's RICO case was not \"proven\"), we would find only a few,\n\nrelatively inconsequential interactions between the defendants and\n\nthese    municipal       entities    during          the    nearly     eight       years    the\n\nenterprise was alleged to have existed.\n\n              The government's response tracks the grounds on which the\n\ndistrict court rejected the defendants' motions for judgments of\n\nacquittal: (1) we should follow the Ninth Circuit and hold that\n\n\"RICO does not require intentional or 'purposeful' behavior by\n\ncorporations charged as members of an association-in-fact,\" United\n\nStates v.

Clemente, 901 F.2d\n\n\n\n                                             -76-\n\f177, 180 (1st Cir. 1990) (emphasizing that the common purpose\n\nrequirement is necessary to \"limit the potentially boundless scope\n\nof the word 'enterprise'\" and thereby \"distinguish culpable, from\n\nnon-culpable,     associations\").17            Indeed,    we    have      applied     the\n\nrequirement    (albeit     without      acknowledging      Feldman)         in   a   case\n\ninvolving an unlawful purpose RICO association-in-fact involving\n\ncorporate legal entities.

Moreover, and decisively, the\n\ndistrict    court     instructed     the       jury    without      objection        from\n\nthe government: \"[I]t is not necessary in proving the existence of\n\nan   enterprise     to    show   that    each     member       of   the     enterprise\n\nparticipated in or even knew of all of its activities, but it is\n\nnecessary to show that all members of the alleged enterprise shared\n\na common purpose.\"        The government has not attempted to reconcile\n\nFeldman with Turkette, Ryan, London, or our other cases applying\n\nTurkette.     See ante at 13.        Thus, as the majority concedes, we\n\ncannot    disregard      the   common-purpose         instruction      in    analyzing\n\ndefendants' sufficiency challenges.

Because the common-purpose\n\ninstruction binds for purposes of our analysis, I shall assume that\n\nthe   government      intends     by   this   assertion   to   argue    that    such\n\n\"control\" is sufficient to impute to the entities the unlawful\n\npurposes of those alleged to control them -- i.e., Cianci and\n\nCorrente.        Compare London, 66 F.3d at 1243-45 (involving closely\n\nheld corporations operated by the defendant and alleged to be\n\nmembers of his unlawful associated-in-fact RICO enterprise); United\n\nStates     v.

I also shall\n\nassume that it would be fair to sustain the defendants' convictions\n\non evidence of such control, notwithstanding the absence of jury\n\ninstructions explaining that a municipal entity's \"purposes\" may be\n\n\n      18\n      Even under the Feldman approach, the court still would face\nthe question whether entities not controlled by those accused of\noperating the alleged association-in-fact enterprise are properly\nconsidered part of such an enterprise.      For the reasons that\nfollow, I do not think that they are. Thus, my conclusion that the\nFeldman rule does not apply under the facts of this case is not\noutcome determinative.\n\n                                        -78-\n\fso ascertained.      Even so, I do not see how the convictions can\n\nstand.\n\n           In my view, there is no proof that Cianci and Corrente so\n\ncontrolled the activities of all the municipal entities alleged to\n\nbe associates of the charged enterprise that the two’s shared\n\ncriminal purposes are reasonably imputed to each such entity.\n\nThere is   no    evidence    that,   for    example,    Cianci   and    Corrente\n\nthemselves could provide those willing to pay bribes with jobs in\n\nCity departments over which they lacked hiring authority; or that\n\nthey could contractually bind City departments under separate\n\nleadership; or that they could sell City property; or that they\n\ncould grant or deny construction variances. Nor did the government\n\nshow that the persons, committees, and boards within the municipal\n\ndepartments, offices, and agencies whose assistance the schemes\n\nrequired abdicated their decision-making responsibilities to Cianci\n\nor Corrente.19    In short, neither Cianci nor Corrente was shown to\n\nhave so dominated the affairs of the departments, offices, and\n\nagencies   claimed   to     be   associated   with     the   unlawful    purpose\n\nenterprise that each of these municipal entities might fairly be\n\nfound to have been an alter ego of Cianci or Corrente with respect\n\n     19\n      This    statement   is   subject   to   the   following   two\nqualifications. First, the jury could have found that Corrente\nhimself had the ability to dictate which towers were placed on the\npolice department's tow list. Second, the jury could have found\nthat the Board of Tax Assessment Review was effectively controlled\nby Cianci and Corrente through the corrupt machinations of RICO co-\nconspirators Joseph Pannone (BTAR's Chairman) and David Ead (BTAR's\nVice-Chairman).\n\n                                     -79-\n\fto the transactions in question.20 Rather, the evidence showed only\n\nthat Cianci and Corrente periodically used the power inherent in\n\n\n\n\n     20\n      By this statement, I do not mean to imply that those\nmunicipal actors to whom Cianci and Corrente directed their\nsuccessful requests and demands (compare infra note 5) always acted\nwithin standard operating procedures or even lawfully.      To the\ncontrary, as the majority explains it:\n\n          [T]he evidence depicted a behavioral spectrum\n     ranging from innocent cooperation to willful complicity\n     in unlawful conduct. For example, with respect to the\n     Freitas Invoices scheme, the evidence was merely that an\n     employee within the City's Finance Department (Lorraine\n     Lisi), acting at Corrente's request, paid valid invoices\n     more promptly than usual. Similarly, with respect to the\n     Ise Job scheme, the evidence was merely that the Deputy\n     Director of the Department of Planning and Development\n     (Thomas Deller) created a temporary position for Ise\n     within the department at Cianci's request. At the more\n     culpable end of the spectrum, however, there was evidence\n     that, in connection with the Jere Lease scheme, the head\n     of the Department of Public Property (Alan Sepe) and the\n     Director of Business Relations for the School Department\n     (Mark Dunham) were influenced by Corrente to tailor the\n     specifications in a School Department lease bid to fit\n     the dimensions of Jere Realty's building, and then to\n     support the Jere Realty lease before the Board of\n     Contract and Supply (which was the entity formally\n     empowered to accept or reject bids of City contracts).\n     Similarly, in connection with the Freitas Lease scheme,\n     there was evidence that Corrente again contacted Dunham\n     prior to finalization of the lease and influenced him to\n     drop consideration of an alternative lease.\n\nAnte at 20 n.3. But importantly, even in connection with these\nlatter two schemes, Sepe and Dunham were not shown to have known of\nand willingly joined the alleged RICO enterprise conspiracy. Nor\nwas there a basis for finding that a majority of the Board of\nContract and Supply, the entity which ultimately voted to accept\nthe Jere Realty lease, did so for purposes of furthering the\nalleged RICO enterprise conspiracy, or even with knowledge that it\nwas ratifying a contract that had been formed in disregard of\nstandard operating procedures.\n\n                               -80-\n\ftheir      positions     to   influence      (or   attempt     to     influence)21    the\n\ndecisions        of   other   municipal      actors    --    actors    who,   with    the\n\nexceptions noted in the preceding footnote, were not shown to be\n\nprivy      to,    let   alone    supportive      of,   the    alleged     enterprise's\n\npurposes.\n\n                 The question arises why this evidence of influence is not\n\nsufficient to make the persons and entities influenced part of the\n\nalleged enterprise.           The answer, I believe, lies in the fact that\n\nwe   are    here      deciding   what   is    required       for    membership   in    an\n\nassociated-in-fact RICO enterprise defined only by the common\n\n\n      21\n      The majority acknowledges that Cianci and Corrente \"did not\nalways get their way . . . .\" Ante at 24. As the majority notes,\nthere was uncontradicted evidence that, in connection with the\nFreitas Lots scheme, Cianci was displeased that elements within the\nProvidence Redevelopment Agency, the entity empowered to sell the\nlots, did not sufficiently accede to his wishes.      See id. n.7.\nThere also was uncontradicted evidence that, in connection with the\nUniversity Club scheme, Cianci was angered when members of the\nProvidence Building Board of Review ignored his wishes and granted\nthe club some of the variances that it sought. See id. Finally,\nthere was uncontradicted evidence that, in connection with the\nMaggiacomo Job scheme, the Chief of Police declined to admit\nMaggiacomo to the police academy because he had a criminal history\nand had been untruthful during a screening interview. See id.\n     The majority suggests that this evidence \"does not defeat the\nintegrity of the charged enterprise\" because the jury could have\nconcluded that \"these glitches in the schemes only meant that\ncertain substantive crimes went uncompleted . . . .\" Id. With\nrespect, I think that the evidence is more telling on the point in\nquestion -- whether there was sufficient evidence that Cianci and\nCorrente so controlled the Providence Redevelopment Agency, the\nProvidence Building Board of Review, and the Department of Public\nSafety that their unlawful purposes should be imputed to these\nentities -- than the majority acknowledges. There was, after all\n(and as the majority concedes, see ante at 17), no other evidence\nfrom which the jury might have found that defendants controlled\nthese agencies (or at least relevantly so).\n\n                                          -81-\n\funlawful purposes of its members.             This is a highly ramified\n\ndecision with implications, criminal and civil, that extend far\n\nbeyond this case.       Were we to permit a person or entity to be named\n\npart of an unlawful purpose enterprise on mere evidence that the\n\nperson or entity acceded to a mobster's request (but without\n\nknowledge of the purposes underlying the request), we would be\n\nheading down the slippery slope against which then-Judge Breyer\n\nwarned     in   Ryan:   that   of   failing   to   differentiate   between\n\nassociations that fall within the sweep of RICO and associations\n\ninvolving only the exploitation of others by criminals.            See 901\n\nF.2d at 180-81 (emphasizing the need to limit \"the potentially\n\nboundless scope of the word 'enterprise' so as to distinguish\n\nculpable from non-culpable associations,\" and recognizing \"the\n\nserious consequences for any man or woman, state official or\n\nprivate person, who is publicly accused of racketeering\"); see\n\nalso Fitzgerald v.

Suppose\nfurther that there was evidence that Cianci called the firm's\nhiring partner and asked that the firm give serious consideration\nto hiring the young lawyer. If the firm did so, would it become a\nmember of the common purpose enterprise alleged in this case? If\nthe answer is \"no\" (as I think it clearly should be), on what\nprincipled basis can we find that the Department of Planning and\nDevelopment -- the agency that created a temporary position for\nChristopher Ise at the request of Cianci -- was proved to be part\nof the enterprise?\n\n                                    -82-\n\fenterprise implies potential culpability under the RICO statute.\n\nSee 901 F.2d at 181; see also 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) (allowing for the\n\nimposition of RICO liability under conspiracy principles).             Thus,\n\nas a matter of logic (not to mention due process), one who lacks\n\nthe mental state necessary for the imposition of RICO liability\n\nbecause he is unaware of the enterprise or its purposes also lacks\n\nthe mental state necessary to be part of a RICO enterprise that is\n\ndefined solely by the shared, culpable mental state of its members.\n\nThis is   ultimately   what,   in   my     view,   dooms   the   government's\n\nenterprise allegations in this case.\n\n          There was in this case significant evidence of public\n\ncorruption.    Perhaps the government could have proved that Cianci\n\nand Corrente ran the Office of the Mayor or the Office of the\n\nDirector of Administration as a RICO enterprise.             Or perhaps the\n\ndefendants (or, more likely, a subset thereof) might have been\n\nshown to be members of one or more smaller, associated-in-fact RICO\n\nenterprises.   But the government successfully persuaded the grand\n\njury to cast a wider net and to allege that the persons named as\n\nenterprise associates, along with the campaign contribution fund,\n\nthe City of Providence, and many of its departments, offices and\n\nagencies, functioned as a de facto organized crime syndicate.\n\nFraming the case in this way permitted the government to allege\n\nthat defendants were responsible under RICO's conspiracy provision\n\nfor all of the illegal and unethical conduct put on display in this\n\n\n\n                                    -83-\n\ftrial -- even that in which they were not shown to have personally\n\nparticipated.23 But this broad case theory obligated the government\n\nto prove that each municipal entity alleged to have engaged in\n\nconduct that constituted part of the \"pattern of racketeering\n\nactivity\" identified in the indictment was itself a member of the\n\nenterprise.   As another court has put it:\n\n          [I]t must be stressed that the government,\n          through its ability to craft indictments, is\n          the master of the scope of the charged RICO\n          conspiracy . . . . [RICO's conspiracy\n          provision] is capable of providing for the\n          linkage in one proceeding of a number of\n          otherwise distinct crimes and/or conspiracies\n          through the concept of enterprise conspiracy.\n          The government, through the vehicle of the\n          indictment,      provides      the    linking\n          conspiratorial objective of a specific RICO\n          violation.   The \"specific\" violation can be\n          broad or narrow. It is the prosecution which\n          sets the parameters to which a RICO conspiracy\n          trial must be confined; having set the stage,\n          the government must be satisfied with the\n          limits of its own creation.\n\nUnited States v.

I therefore agree with Justice Breyer\n\nthat we must place comprehensible limits on RICO's reach and that\n\nan important way of cabining the statute is to require true\n\nculpability before one may be named part of an associated-in-fact\n\nRICO enterprise defined by the common unlawful purposes of its\n\nconstituents.     See Ryan, 901 F.2d at 180-81.           Such a limitation\n\nhelps to ensure that cases involving claims of political corruption\n\nwill not also inevitably give rise to a RICO charge, and that cases\n\ninvolving   multiple    acts   of   common      law   fraud   will   not     also\n\ninevitably give rise to civil liability under the statute.\n\n            In this case, the government proved only that many of the\n\nmunicipal entities named in the indictment were used as tools by\n\ndefendants.     For reasons I have explained, this is not enough to\n\nprove that these entities were part of a RICO enterprise defined\n\n\n     24\n      I am speaking generally here and in no way intend to impugn\nthose who brought this case. Indeed, there is no reason to doubt\nthat the government’s enterprise allegations were made in a good\nfaith attempt to comply with circuit precedent in this tricky area\nof the law.\n\n                                    -85-\n\fonly by the shared unlawful goals of its members.              Thus, the\n\ngovernment failed to prove the existence of the enterprise alleged\n\nin connection with the RICO counts, and the RICO convictions cannot\n\nstand.   See United States v.
