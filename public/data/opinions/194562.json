The\n\nwarrant  was based  on information  provided by  Carlos Gutierrez\n\nBorrero.   Following his own arrest  for distributing counterfeit\n\none  hundred dollar bills, Gutierrez  had identified the owner of\n\nthe VCR repair shop, Luis Oliveras Quintana, as the source of the\n\ncounterfeit obligations.  Counterfeit bills in one hundred dollar\n\ndenominations totaling $392,000 were  seized at the shop.   After\n\nOliveras  was arrested, he  agreed to cooperate  with the govern-\n\n                    \n\n     1Appellant was charged with  conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C.\n  471 and with aiding  and abetting violations of   472,  473 and\n474.  Section 471  criminalizes the false making,  forging, coun-\nterfeiting, or  altering of any  obligation or other  security of\nthe United States, with  intent to defraud;   472:   the passing,\nuttering, publishing, or  selling, with intent to defraud, of any\nfalsely  made, forged,  counterfeited,  or altered  obligation or\nother security of the United States;   473:  the buying, selling,\nexchanging, transferring, receiving, or delivering, of any false,\nforged, counterfeited, or altered obligation or other security of\nthe  United  States, with  the intent  that  the same  be passed,\npublished,  or used as true and genuine;   474:  printing, photo-\ngraphing, or in any other manner making or executing, any engrav-\ning, photograph, print, or impression in the likeness of any such\nobligation  or other  security.   Section  371 criminalizes  con-\nspiracies  to defraud  the United  States;   2:   the  aiding and\nabetting of an offense against the United States.\n\nment.  Oliveras advised the agents that appellant was expected to\n\nvisit  the shop on January 21  to collect the  cash proceeds from\n\nthe sale of  the counterfeit and to pick up  the remainder of the\n\nundistributed counterfeit bills.\n\n          On  January 21,  under  Secret   Service  surveillance,\n\nappellant arrived at the shop and Oliveras handed him a briefcase\n\ncontaining the undistributed counterfeit bills.  A Secret Service\n\nagent overheard  appellant inquiring about \"series  11.\"2  Appel-\n\nlant removed three bills from the briefcase, put something in his\n\npocket,  then left  the  shop and  placed  the briefcase  in  his\n\nvehicle,  whereupon  he  was  arrested.   Following  his  arrest,\n\nundistributed  counterfeit bills  were  found in  the  briefcase,\n\nthree more were removed  from his pocket, and a  notation bearing\n\nthe name \"Carlos Gutierrez Borrero\" was found in his wallet.\n\n          Oliveras continued  to cooperate by providing  a state-\n\nment  minimizing his  own responsibility  for the  counterfeiting\n\nscheme.   After failing a polygraph examination, he admitted to a\n\nlarger role in  the counterfeiting scheme.   Both statements made\n\nby  Oliveras were disclosed prior to trial, but appellant was not\n\ninformed of the polygraph testing or the test results.\n\n          As a consequence of Oliveras' cooperation, the printing\n\nequipment  and paraphernalia  were seized  and appellant  and his\n\n                    \n\n     2The trial testimony explained  that \"series 11\" referred to\ncounterfeit bills which were the best quality imitations, bearing\nserial numbers ending in \"11\".\n\n                                4\n\nfour codefendantswere indicted.  The otherdefendants pled guilty.\n\n          At appellant's trial, the government presented testimo-\n\nny that appellant had approached Oliveras with a plan to make and\n\ndistribute counterfeit  one hundred dollar bills  and that appel-\n\nlant  had  indicated to  Oliveras that  he  knew people  who were\n\ninterested in purchasing the counterfeit.  The evidence indicated\n\nthat  appellant  and one  Freddie  Velez provided  the  paper for\n\nprinting the  counterfeit bills  and, though not  present at  the\n\nactual printing, that appellant expected  to share in the profits\n\nfrom the counterfeiting operation.  After a three-day jury trial,\n\nappellant was convicted on all four counts.   He was sentenced to\n\nconcurrent forty-five month terms on each count.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\n                           \n\n          Appellant seems to assert that the jury verdicts on the\n\nthree substantive counts  cannot stand, as there  was no evidence\n\nthat  he was  present  at the  time  the counterfeit  bills  were\n\nprinted; and that  the conspiracy conviction cannot  stand, as it\n\nwas based on \"mere presence\" at the crime scene on January 21.\n\n          Under the  \"offense clause\" of section  371, a sustain-\n\nable conviction requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\ndefendant conspired  to commit the substantive  offense which was\n\nthe  object of the unlawful  agreement.  United  States v. Lopez,\n                                                                \n\n944  F.2d 33, 39 (1st  Cir. 1991); United  States v. Sanchez, 917\n                                                            \n\n                                5\n\nF.2d 607,  610 (1st  Cir. 1990), cert.  denied, 111  S.

A  conviction  for aiding  and  abetting a  substantive\n\noffense requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that  the defen-\n\ndant associated  himself with  the commission of  the substantive\n\noffense, participated  in  it as  something  he wished  to  bring\n\nabout, and  sought by his  actions to  make it  succeed.   United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.

Evidence of \"mere presence\" can\n\nsustain  neither a  conviction for  conspiracy, United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nTejeda,  974  F.2d 210,  213 (1st  Cir.  1992); United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nOcampo,  964 F.2d  80, 82  (1st  Cir. 1992),  nor for  aiding and\n      \n\nabetting,  United States v.

Figueroa, 976 F.2d  1446, 1459 (1st\n                                      \n\nCir. 1992);  United States  v. Lopez, 944  F.2d 33, 39  (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n1991).   The evidence may be entirely circumstantial and need not\n\nexclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence; in other words,\n\nthe  jury may  accept any  reasonable interpretation of  the evi-\n\ndence, United States  v. Batista-Polanco,  927 F.2d  14, 17  (1st\n                                        \n\nCir. 1991), and we must do the same.\n\n                                6\n\n          The  evidence  was  sufficient to  establish  beyond  a\n\nreasonable  doubt that  appellant  knowingly  conspired to  make,\n\npossess,  and  deliver counterfeit  obligations,  with  intent to\n\ndefraud  the United  States, and  that he  aided and  abetted the\n\npossession, delivery  and  printing of  counterfeit  obligations.\n\nThe  evidence revealed  that the five  co-conspirators, appellant\n\namong them,  caused approximately $800,000 in counterfeit obliga-\n\ntions  to be printed.  Appellant not only suggested that Oliveras\n\nprint  the counterfeit  obligations but  provided the  paper, ar-\n\nranged a  distribution network, aided and  abetted the collection\n\nof the illicit proceeds,  and personally recovered the undistrib-\n\nuted counterfeit bills.\n\n          The  contention  that  he  could not  be  convicted  of\n\nconspiracy unless he was at the shop when  the bills were printed\n\nis as  bogus as  the bills  printed in his  absence.   \"[U]nder a\n\nbasic tenet of traditional  conspiracy theory . . . a conspirator\n\nis  responsible  for acts  his  or  her co-conspirators  executed\n\nduring  the  existence and  in  furtherance  of the  conspiracy.\"\n\nUnited  States  v.

Similarly, appellant's convictions\n        \n\nfor  aiding and  abetting the  printing of  the bogus  bills were\n\namply supported by  the evidence that  he initiated the  counter-\n\nfeiting  scheme, recruited  Oliveras, and  provided the  paper on\n\nwhich the bills were printed.\n\n                                7\n\nEvidentiary Rulings\n                   \n\n          Appellant challenges two evidentiary rulings,  which we\n\nreview for abuse of discretion.  United States  v. Arias-Santana,\n                                                                \n\n964  F.2d 1262, 1264 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v. Abreu, 952\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1458, 1467 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 1695 (1992).\n                                        \n\n          First,  appellant asserts that the district court erred\n\nin admitting evidence  seized from  the shop,  consisting of  the\n\nprinting press, lamp,  paper, and ink used in  the counterfeiting\n\nprocess.   He frivolously contends  that the seized  evidence was\n\nnot  relevant to  the  charges against  him  because he  was  not\n\npresent  at  the time  the  bills were  printed.   As  a founding\n\nmember,  however, appellant  was  criminally responsible  for all\n\nacts  committed in furtherance of  the conspiracy.  See Figueroa,\n                                                                \n\n976 F.2d at 1452 (evidence of recorded statements of coconspirat-\n\nors admissible against defendant).\n\n          Second, appellant claims that  the district court erred\n\nin excluding, as  hearsay, the allegedly exculpatory  post-arrest\n\nstatements of  codefendants Velez  and Santiago, neither  of whom\n\nwas called  to testify at trial.   He argues that  the statements\n\nwere admissible  as coconspirator statements pursuant  to Fed. R.\n\nEvid.  801(d)(2)(E).   Appellant's argument  misses the  mark, as\n\nEvidence  Rule 801(d)(2)(E)  applies to  coconspirator statements\n\nmade  \"during the course  and in furtherance  of the conspiracy,\"\n\nFed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E);  see also Ortiz, 966 F.2d  at 714-15,\n                                           \n\nwhereas these statements were made neither during nor in further-\n\nance of the conspiracy.\n\n                                8\n\nNondisclosure of Polygraph Testing and Results\n                                              \n\n          Appellant claims that the  government failed to provide\n\nadequate pretrial discovery  by withholding the information  that\n\nOliveras took and failed  a polygraph test.  According  to appel-\n\nlant,  knowledge of the  failed polygraph  would have  helped the\n\ndefense establish that  Oliveras lied.   We must  reverse if  the\n\ntotality of  the circumstances  indicates that the  nondisclosure\n\n\"'might  have affected the outcome of the trial.'\"  United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.

During pretrial discovery, the defense was\n\nprovided with  the two inconsistent statements  made by Oliveras.\n\nAppellant  therefore was well  aware that at  least one statement\n\nwas false, at least in part, which plainly enabled the defense to\n\nchallenge Oliveras' credibility on  that ground.3  Thus, evidence\n\nof  Oliveras' failure to pass the polygraph was cumulative to the\n\ninconsistent  statements previously  introduced in  evidence, see\n                                                                 \n\nSanchez, 917  F.2d at  618 (nondisclosure of  cumulative evidence\n       \n\nnot material to conviction) (citing cases), especially in view of\n\n                    \n\n     3Oliveras' initial statement falsely asserted that appellant\nwas  almost totally  responsible for  the counterfeiting  scheme.\nThe  second statement  conceded that  Oliveras had  a significant\nrole in the conspiracy.\n\n                                9\n\nthe  vigorous  impeachment to  which  Oliveras  was subjected  on\n\ncross-examination, see  United States v. Shelton,  588 F.2d 1242,\n                                                \n\n1248 (9th Cir.  1978), cert.  denied, 442 U.S.  909 (1979)  (\"Im-\n                                    \n\npeachment evidence,  even that  which tends to  further undermine\n\nthe credibility  of the key Government  witness whose credibility\n\nhas already been shaken  due to extensive cross-examination, does\n\nnot create a reasonable  doubt that did not otherwise  exist when\n\nthat evidence is cumulative or collateral.\") (citations omitted).\n\nFinally,  after  the  testimony of  Oliveras,  during  government\n\ncounsel's  direct  examination  of  the  agent  who  interrogated\n\nOliveras,  the jury was made  aware that Oliveras  had failed the\n\npolygraph test.  The defense in turn inquired about the polygraph\n\non cross-examination of the government agent, but made no request\n\nto recall Oliveras.\n\n          We therefore  conclude that the  government's imprudent\n\ndecision to withhold pretrial disclosure of the polygraph testing\n\nand results could not have altered these jury verdicts.\n\nVariance\n        \n\n          Although appellant alleges that there was an \"impermis-\n\nsible variance between the offense as presented to the Grand Jury\n\n. . .  and the case presented  in Court,\" he  identifies no vari-\n\nance.  See,  e.g., United States v. Zannino, 895  F.2d 1, 17 (1st\n                                           \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082 (1990) (arguments adverted  to\n                   \n\nwith no  attempt at  developed argumentation are  deemed waived).\n\nEven  if the variance claim  were not deemed  waived, however, we\n\nwould reject it,  as the indictment clearly apprised appellant of\n\n                                10\n\nthe charges against him  and the evidence presented at  trial was\n\n\"relevant  to and within the scope of  the crimes\" charged in the\n\nindictment.

The district court\n\nfound that  appellant was a  \"manager or supervisor\"  of criminal\n\nactivity involving five or more participants.  We review role-in-\n\noffense rulings for clear  error.

Schultz, 970\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  960, 963-64 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 61 U.S.L.W. 3479\n                                               \n\n(1993); United States  v. Panet-Collazo, 960  F.2d 256, 261  (1st\n                                       \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 220 (1992).\n                   \n\n          Section 3B1.1  of the Sentencing  Guidelines prescribes\n\noffense level  enhancements based  \"upon the  size of a  criminal\n\norganization (i.e.,  the number  of participants in  the offense)\n                  \n\nand the degree to which the defendant was responsible for commit-\n\nting  the  offense.\"    U.S.S.G.     3B1.1,  comment.  (backg'd).\n\nSection 3B1.1(b) directs  an increase in the offense  level \"[i]f\n\nthe defendant was a  manager or supervisor (but not  an organizer\n\nor leader) and the  criminal activity involved five or  more par-\n\nticipants  or  was  otherwise  extensive.\"   Although  the  terms\n\n\"manager\" and \"supervisor\" are not defined in the Guidelines, the\n\napplication  notes  to  section  3B1.1  list  seven  nonexclusive\n\n                                11\n\nfactors for use in distinguishing a \"leadership and organization-\n\nal role [for  which section 3B1.1 provides  a four-level increase\n\nif the criminal activity involved five or more participants] from\n\none of mere management or supervision.\"  Id. comment. (n.3).4\n                                            \n\n          The presentence  report  recommended a  four-level  in-\n\ncrease due  to appellant's  aggravated role  as  an organizer  or\n\nleader of a  criminal activity involving  five participants.   In\n\nresponse to defense objections  at sentencing, the court declined\n\nto adopt the recommendation in the presentence report.  The court\n\nnevertheless found that  three of the seven factors to be used in\n\ndistinguishing a \"leader or organizer\"  from a \"manager or super-\n\nvisor\" were  satisfied  in  the  present case:    recruitment  of\n\naccomplices, a  substantial role  in planning and  organizing the\n\noffense,  and  the  extensive  nature and  scope  of  the illegal\n\nactivity.   The  court  found in  particular  that appellant  had\n\n\"seduced\" Oliveras into joining  the conspiracy and that Oliveras\n\nin turn  had  brought in  others,  including those  who  actually\n\nprinted the  counterfeit; that appellant, under  an assumed name,\n\npurchased  the paper  on which  the counterfeit  obligations were\n\nprinted;  and  that the  illegal  activity  was extensive  as  it\n\ninvolved approximately $800,000 in counterfeit obligations.\n\n                    \n\n     4The factors listed in   3B1.1, comment. n.1 are:\n\n     the exercise of  decision making authority,  the nature\n     of participation in the  commission of the offense, the\n     recruitment  of  accomplices,  the claimed  right  to a\n     larger  share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of\n     participation  in planning  or organizing  the offense,\n     the nature and  scope of the illegal activity,  and the\n     degree of control and authority exercised over others.\n\n                                12\n\n          There was  no clear error in the  enhancement of appel-\n\nlant's sentence  as a  \"manager or  supervisor.\"   The sentencing\n\ncourt explicitly found that appellant played an important role in\n\nplanning and organizing the  offense, which entailed an increased\n\ndegree of responsibility for  the commission of the offense.   As\n\nthis court  has noted, the  section 3B1.1 enhancement  applies if\n\nthe  defendant  \"exercised some  degree  of  control over  others\n\ninvolved in the commission  of the crime or he  [was] responsible\n                                                                 \n\nfor organizing others for the purpose of carrying out the crime.\"\n                                                               \n\nUnited  States v.  Fuller, 897  F.2d 1217,  1220 (1st  Cir. 1990)\n                         \n\n(emphasis added); see also United States v. Brown, 944 F.2d 1377,\n                                                 \n\n1381 (7th Cir. 1991)  (same).  Finally,  we find no clear  error,\n\nparticularly in light of  appellant's critical role in recruiting\n\na reluctant  Oliveras, a  well-known figure in  criminal circles,\n\nwho  was indispensable to the conspiracy in that he alone appears\n\nto  have  been able  to recruit  others  capable of  printing the\n\ncounterfeit obligations.

Pierce,  907 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n56,  57 (8th  Cir.  1990) (recruitment  finding \"provides  strong\n\nsupport for  the conclusion that [defendant]  played a managerial\n\nor supervisory role under   3B1.1(b)\").\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                                13\n",

The\n\nwarrant  was based  on information  provided by  Carlos Gutierrez\n\nBorrero.   Following his own arrest  for distributing counterfeit\n\none  hundred dollar bills, Gutierrez  had identified the owner of\n\nthe VCR repair shop, Luis Oliveras Quintana, as the source of the\n\ncounterfeit obligations.  Counterfeit bills in one hundred dollar\n\ndenominations totaling $392,000 were  seized at the shop.   After\n\nOliveras  was arrested, he  agreed to cooperate  with the govern-\n\n                    \n\n     1Appellant was charged with  conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C.\n  471 and with aiding  and abetting violations of   472,  473 and\n474.  Section 471  criminalizes the false making,  forging, coun-\nterfeiting, or  altering of any  obligation or other  security of\nthe United States, with  intent to defraud;   472:   the passing,\nuttering, publishing, or  selling, with intent to defraud, of any\nfalsely  made, forged,  counterfeited,  or altered  obligation or\nother security of the United States;   473:  the buying, selling,\nexchanging, transferring, receiving, or delivering, of any false,\nforged, counterfeited, or altered obligation or other security of\nthe  United  States, with  the intent  that  the same  be passed,\npublished,  or used as true and genuine;   474:  printing, photo-\ngraphing, or in any other manner making or executing, any engrav-\ning, photograph, print, or impression in the likeness of any such\nobligation  or other  security.   Section  371 criminalizes  con-\nspiracies  to defraud  the United  States;   2:   the  aiding and\nabetting of an offense against the United States.\n\nment.  Oliveras advised the agents that appellant was expected to\n\nvisit  the shop on January 21  to collect the  cash proceeds from\n\nthe sale of  the counterfeit and to pick up  the remainder of the\n\nundistributed counterfeit bills.\n\n          On  January 21,  under  Secret   Service  surveillance,\n\nappellant arrived at the shop and Oliveras handed him a briefcase\n\ncontaining the undistributed counterfeit bills.  A Secret Service\n\nagent overheard  appellant inquiring about \"series  11.\"2  Appel-\n\nlant removed three bills from the briefcase, put something in his\n\npocket,  then left  the  shop and  placed  the briefcase  in  his\n\nvehicle,  whereupon  he  was  arrested.   Following  his  arrest,\n\nundistributed  counterfeit bills  were  found in  the  briefcase,\n\nthree more were removed  from his pocket, and a  notation bearing\n\nthe name \"Carlos Gutierrez Borrero\" was found in his wallet.\n\n          Oliveras continued  to cooperate by providing  a state-\n\nment  minimizing his  own responsibility  for the  counterfeiting\n\nscheme.   After failing a polygraph examination, he admitted to a\n\nlarger role in  the counterfeiting scheme.   Both statements made\n\nby  Oliveras were disclosed prior to trial, but appellant was not\n\ninformed of the polygraph testing or the test results.\n\n          As a consequence of Oliveras' cooperation, the printing\n\nequipment  and paraphernalia  were seized  and appellant  and his\n\n                    \n\n     2The trial testimony explained  that \"series 11\" referred to\ncounterfeit bills which were the best quality imitations, bearing\nserial numbers ending in \"11\".\n\n                                4\n\nfour codefendantswere indicted.  The otherdefendants pled guilty.\n\n          At appellant's trial, the government presented testimo-\n\nny that appellant had approached Oliveras with a plan to make and\n\ndistribute counterfeit  one hundred dollar bills  and that appel-\n\nlant  had  indicated to  Oliveras that  he  knew people  who were\n\ninterested in purchasing the counterfeit.  The evidence indicated\n\nthat  appellant  and one  Freddie  Velez provided  the  paper for\n\nprinting the  counterfeit bills  and, though not  present at  the\n\nactual printing, that appellant expected  to share in the profits\n\nfrom the counterfeiting operation.  After a three-day jury trial,\n\nappellant was convicted on all four counts.   He was sentenced to\n\nconcurrent forty-five month terms on each count.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\n                           \n\n          Appellant seems to assert that the jury verdicts on the\n\nthree substantive counts  cannot stand, as there  was no evidence\n\nthat  he was  present  at the  time  the counterfeit  bills  were\n\nprinted; and that  the conspiracy conviction cannot  stand, as it\n\nwas based on \"mere presence\" at the crime scene on January 21.\n\n          Under the  \"offense clause\" of section  371, a sustain-\n\nable conviction requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\ndefendant conspired  to commit the substantive  offense which was\n\nthe  object of the unlawful  agreement.

He frivolously contends  that the seized  evidence was\n\nnot  relevant to  the  charges against  him  because he  was  not\n\npresent  at  the time  the  bills were  printed.   As  a founding\n\nmember,  however, appellant  was  criminally responsible  for all\n\nacts  committed in furtherance of  the conspiracy.

He argues that  the statements\n\nwere admissible  as coconspirator statements pursuant  to Fed. R.\n\nEvid.  801(d)(2)(E).

During pretrial discovery, the defense was\n\nprovided with  the two inconsistent statements  made by Oliveras.\n\nAppellant  therefore was well  aware that at  least one statement\n\nwas false, at least in part, which plainly enabled the defense to\n\nchallenge Oliveras' credibility on  that ground.3  Thus, evidence\n\nof  Oliveras' failure to pass the polygraph was cumulative to the\n\ninconsistent  statements previously  introduced in  evidence, see\n                                                                 \n\nSanchez, 917  F.2d at  618 (nondisclosure of  cumulative evidence\n       \n\nnot material to conviction) (citing cases), especially in view of\n\n                    \n\n     3Oliveras' initial statement falsely asserted that appellant\nwas  almost totally  responsible for  the counterfeiting  scheme.\nThe  second statement  conceded that  Oliveras had  a significant\nrole in the conspiracy.\n\n                                9\n\nthe  vigorous  impeachment to  which  Oliveras  was subjected  on\n\ncross-examination, see  United States v.

(backg'd).\n\nSection 3B1.1(b) directs  an increase in the offense  level \"[i]f\n\nthe defendant was a  manager or supervisor (but not  an organizer\n\nor leader) and the  criminal activity involved five or  more par-\n\nticipants  or  was  otherwise  extensive.\"   Although  the  terms\n\n\"manager\" and \"supervisor\" are not defined in the Guidelines, the\n\napplication  notes  to  section  3B1.1  list  seven  nonexclusive\n\n                                11\n\nfactors for use in distinguishing a \"leadership and organization-\n\nal role [for  which section 3B1.1 provides  a four-level increase\n\nif the criminal activity involved five or more participants] from\n\none of mere management or supervision.\"  Id. comment.

In\n\nresponse to defense objections  at sentencing, the court declined\n\nto adopt the recommendation in the presentence report.  The court\n\nnevertheless found that  three of the seven factors to be used in\n\ndistinguishing a \"leader or organizer\"  from a \"manager or super-\n\nvisor\" were  satisfied  in  the  present case:    recruitment  of\n\naccomplices, a  substantial role  in planning and  organizing the\n\noffense,  and  the  extensive  nature and  scope  of  the illegal\n\nactivity.   The  court  found in  particular  that appellant  had\n\n\"seduced\" Oliveras into joining  the conspiracy and that Oliveras\n\nin turn  had  brought in  others,  including those  who  actually\n\nprinted the  counterfeit; that appellant, under  an assumed name,\n\npurchased  the paper  on which  the counterfeit  obligations were\n\nprinted;  and  that the  illegal  activity  was extensive  as  it\n\ninvolved approximately $800,000 in counterfeit obligations.\n\n                    \n\n     4The factors listed in   3B1.1, comment. n.1 are:\n\n     the exercise of  decision making authority,  the nature\n     of participation in the  commission of the offense, the\n     recruitment  of  accomplices,  the claimed  right  to a\n     larger  share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of\n     participation  in planning  or organizing  the offense,\n     the nature and  scope of the illegal activity,  and the\n     degree of control and authority exercised over others.\n\n                                12\n\n          There was  no clear error in the  enhancement of appel-\n\nlant's sentence  as a  \"manager or  supervisor.\"   The sentencing\n\ncourt explicitly found that appellant played an important role in\n\nplanning and organizing the  offense, which entailed an increased\n\ndegree of responsibility for  the commission of the offense.   As\n\nthis court  has noted, the  section 3B1.1 enhancement  applies if\n\nthe  defendant  \"exercised some  degree  of  control over  others\n\ninvolved in the commission  of the crime or he  [was] responsible\n                                                                 \n\nfor organizing others for the purpose of carrying out the crime.\"\n                                                               \n\nUnited  States v.

Finally,  we find no clear  error,\n\nparticularly in light of  appellant's critical role in recruiting\n\na reluctant  Oliveras, a  well-known figure in  criminal circles,\n\nwho  was indispensable to the conspiracy in that he alone appears\n\nto  have  been able  to recruit  others  capable of  printing the\n\ncounterfeit obligations.
