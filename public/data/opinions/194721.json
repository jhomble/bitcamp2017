Plaintiffs/appellants are  the widow\n                     \n\nand children  of the late  Jose M. Solis Rivera.   Plaintiffs\n\nbrought this  action pursuant to the Federal  Tort Claims Act\n\n(\"FTCA\"), 28 U.S.C.   2671  et seq., claiming that the United\n                                   \n\nStates  Department of  Veterans'  Affairs (\"VA\")  negligently\n\nfailed  to diagnose and  treat Solis Rivera's  prostate gland\n\ncancer.     Plaintiffs  appeal  from  the   district  court's\n\ndismissal  of  the   case  without  prejudice  for   lack  of\n\nprosecution.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Plaintiffs filed  their  complaint  on  August  19,\n\n1991.  On February 13, 1992, the government filed a motion to\n\ndismiss the complaint, arguing that plaintiffs had improperly\n\nfiled their  administrative claim in  the name of  Jose Solis\n\nRivera  and his  heirs,  rather  than in  the  name of  Solis\n\nRivera's  estate   or  in   the  names   of  the   plaintiffs\n\nindividually as his heirs.  Plaintiffs did not respond to the\n\ngovernment's motion to dismiss within ten days of service, as\n\nrequired by Local Rule 311.5  of the District of Puerto Rico.\n\nOn March  23, 1992, after more than  a month had passed since\n\nservice of the motion to dismiss, the district court  entered\n\nan  order dismissing the complaint with prejudice for failure\n\nto  diligently prosecute the  action.  A  judgment dismissing\n\nthe case was entered on March 31.\n\n                             -2-\n\n          Plaintiffs thereafter filed a  motion to vacate and\n\nset aside  the court's order  and a motion to  reconsider the\n\njudgment.   In  the motions,  plaintiffs' attorney  explained\n\nthat  he thought  the  district court,  during  a February  7\n\nstatus conference, had approved a thirty-day period to answer\n\nthe  government's proposed  motion to  dismiss.   Plaintiffs'\n\nattorney further explained that he had been busy with another\n\ncase for  three weeks, and asked  the court to impose  a less\n\nsevere sanction than dismissal with prejudice in light of the\n\nisolated nature of his dilatory action.\n\n          On  May  29,  1992,  the  district  court   granted\n\nplaintiffs' request  to vacate and set aside  its prior order\n\ndismissing  the case.  On the same  day, the court granted to\n\nthe government fifteen days to file a detailed  memorandum of\n\nlaw in support of the motion to  dismiss that it had filed on\n\nFebruary 13.  Plaintiffs were given ten days to respond.  \n\n          On June 12, 1992, in compliance with the order, the\n\ngovernment  filed  the  more detailed  memorandum  of  law in\n\nsupport of  its motion  to dismiss.   On June  23, plaintiffs\n\nrequested  an additional  five  days  to  respond  ostensibly\n\nbecause plaintiffs' attorney was unable to find in his  files\n\na contemporaneous motion to dismiss.  The government contends\n\nthat  it  subsequently informed  plaintiffs' attorney  that a\n\ncopy of the motion  to dismiss filed on February 13, 1992 was\n\nto  accompany  its  memorandum  of  law  of  June  12.    The\n\n                             -3-\n\ngovernment   faxed  a  copy  of  the  motion  to  dismiss  to\n\nplaintiffs' attorney on June 24.\n\n          Approximately a month passed with no  response from\n\nplaintiffs.  On July 29,  1992, the government filed a motion\n\nto  adjudicate, asking  the  court to  dismiss the  case with\n\nprejudice because  plaintiffs had  failed to  respond to  its\n\nmotion  to dismiss twenty-nine business days after they filed\n\na request for an extension.\n\n          On  August  10,  1992,  plaintiffs filed  a  motion\n\nopposing the government's motion to adjudicate.   Plaintiffs'\n\nattorney claimed  he was not  informed until July 16  that he\n\nwas not  missing any of the government's  pleadings, and that\n\nhe had  been busy  with another jury  trial, but  expected to\n\ncomplete  an opposing  memorandum within  a day  or two.   On\n\nAugust  18,  1992,  plaintiffs  finally  filed  a  memorandum\n\nopposing the government's motion to dismiss.\n\n          By  that  time,  however,  the  district court  had\n\nalready entered an order dated August  12 dismissing the case\n\nwith prejudice for lack of prosecution.  Judgment was entered\n\non August 19, 1992.\n\n          On  August  25,  plaintiffs   filed  a  motion  for\n\nreconsideration.  They  argued that (1) they  had filed their\n\nmemorandum on August  18, before receiving the  court's order\n\ndated August 12 and before  judgment was entered; and (2) the\n\nessentials  of  plaintiffs'  opposition to  the  government's\n\n                             -4-\n\nmotion to dismiss  had been tendered in plaintiffs'  March 27\n\nmotion to vacate.\n\n          On October 22,  1992, the district court  issued an\n\norder  denying plaintiffs'  motion  for reconsideration,  but\n\nmodifying  the August  12, 1992  order  to dismissal  without\n\nprejudice.   Plaintiffs  appeal  from  the  district  court's\n\nOctober 22, 1992 order dismissing the case without prejudice.\n\n                             II.\n\n          Rule  41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\nexpressly  authorizes  a  district court  to  dismiss  a case\n\n\"[f]or failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or comply with .\n\n.  . any  order of  court.\"   Dismissal  with prejudice  is a\n                                                       \n\n\"harsh sanction,\" Richman  v.

We review  a district court's  dismissal for  lack of\n\nprosecution only for an abuse of discretion.   E.g., Figueroa\n                                                             \n\nRuiz, 896 F.2d at 647.  \n    \n\n          Plaintiffs  contend   that  the   district  court's\n\ndismissal without prejudice is the functional equivalent of a\n\ndismissal  with  prejudice  since  the six-month  statute  of\n\nlimitations  authorized in  the FTCA,  28  U.S.C.    2401(b),\n\n(providing in substance  that, in an FTCA case,  suit must be\n\n\"begun within six months  after the date of mailing .  . . of\n\nnotice  of final [administrative]  denial of the  claim\") had\n\nlong since  passed and there  appears to be no  likelihood of\n\nequitable tolling.  See de Casenave v. United States, No. 92-\n                                                    \n\n2102,  slip  op.  at  6  (1st Cir.  April  20,  1993)  (where\n\nplaintiffs' initial  lawsuit  was dismissed  for  failure  to\n\nabide by discovery orders, and record contains no evidence of\n\nmisconduct  on part of government, court \"discern[s] no basis\n\nunder which the  district court could have  applied equitable\n\nprinciples\" to toll FTCA's six-month statute of limitations);\n\nPipkin v.  United States  Postal Service,  951 F.2d  272, 274\n                                        \n\n(10th Cir. 1991) (refusing to toll FTCA six-month limitations\n\nperiod  during  filing  of previous  FTCA  lawsuit  which was\n\ndismissed  without  prejudice   for  failure  to  prosecute).\n\n                             -6-\n\nPlaintiffs  argue  that  their dilatory  conduct  was  not so\n\negregious  as to  justify what  is, in  effect, the  ultimate\n\nsanction of dismissal with prejudice.  \n\n          The district  court may, indeed,  have been unaware\n\nthat the applicable statute of limitations had expired.   The\n\ncourt's  October 22  modification  of  its  August  12  order\n\ndismissing  the  case  from   \"with  prejudice\"  to  \"without\n\nprejudice\"  suggests  that  the  court  may  have  felt  that\n\nplaintiffs were  in a position to refile  their case.  Such a\n\nbelief  on the  court's part  would  be understandable  given\n\nplaintiffs' counsel's neglect, either before or after October\n\n22,  1992,  to  point  out  to  the  court  their limitations\n\nproblem.\n\n          Resolution of this appeal is not altogether simple.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorney's failure on two occasions to respond to\n\nplain  deadlines was egregious.   If  the district  court had\n\ndismissed with prejudice in these circumstances, we could not\n              \n\nsay  it  had  abused its  discretion.    However, by  finally\n\ndismissing without  prejudice, the  district  court seems  to\n                  \n\nhave  indicated  a  merciful  wish  not  to  visit  counsel's\n\ndereliction  upon  the  heads of  plaintiffs  by  barring the\n\naction altogether.   A district  court, which has  direct and\n\ncontinuous  contact with attorneys, is best  able to judge in\n\nthe  first  instance  whether  an  attorney's  misconduct  is\n\nsufficiently  egregious to  warrant the  \"death  knell\" of  a\n\n                             -7-\n\nlawsuit, see  Aoude v. Mobil  Oil Corp., 892 F.2d  1115, 1118\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir.  1989), or  whether some  lesser sanction  would be\n\nmore appropriate.\n\n          Given the  district court's action  in changing the\n\ndismissal  from  \"with\"   to  \"without\"  prejudice,   we  are\n\npersuaded to remand  to the same district judge  to allow him\n\nto decide  whether,  given the  surfacing of  the statute  of\n\nlimitations problem, he  wishes to give plaintiffs  a further\n\nchance  by allowing  the present  action to  proceed.   In so\n\nremanding,  we may be  criticized for overlooking plaintiffs'\n\nfailure to have  raised the limitations problem  below.  This\n\ncourt  will  not  ordinarily  consider  a  matter  not  first\n\npresented to the  district court.  E.g.,  Boston Celtics Ltd.\n                                                             \n\nPartnership v.  Shaw, 908 F.2d  1041, 1045  (1st Cir.  1990).\n                    \n\nStill, we think  the district court is better positioned than\n\nourselves to  determine  the course  of  justice here.    We,\n\ntherefore, vacate and remand, but emphasize that we leave the\n\nchoice entirely in the hands of the district court, which may\n\neither choose to confirm the  \"death knell\" of this action by\n\nreentry of  its previous  or some  other dismissal  order, or\n\nelse allow the case to proceed.  If the district court allows\n\nthe  case to  proceed, the  court may  wish to  assure itself\n\neither   that  present  counsel   will  in  the   future  act\n\nresponsibly  or that  new  counsel  will  be  substituted  by\n\nplaintiffs.  The court may  also consider whether to  impose,\n\n                             -8-\n\nas a condition to allowing  the case to go forward, pecuniary\n\nsanctions, to be  paid by present counsel  personally, and to\n\nsee that  present counsel does  not bill its own  clients for\n\ntime related to its ineffective and annoying conduct to date.\n\n          Vacated  and remanded  for  further proceedings  in\n                                                             \n\naccordance  herewith.

A  judgment dismissing\n\nthe case was entered on March 31.\n\n                             -2-\n\n          Plaintiffs thereafter filed a  motion to vacate and\n\nset aside  the court's order  and a motion to  reconsider the\n\njudgment.   In  the motions,  plaintiffs' attorney  explained\n\nthat  he thought  the  district court,  during  a February  7\n\nstatus conference, had approved a thirty-day period to answer\n\nthe  government's proposed  motion to  dismiss.   Plaintiffs'\n\nattorney further explained that he had been busy with another\n\ncase for  three weeks, and asked  the court to impose  a less\n\nsevere sanction than dismissal with prejudice in light of the\n\nisolated nature of his dilatory action.\n\n          On  May  29,  1992,  the  district  court   granted\n\nplaintiffs' request  to vacate and set aside  its prior order\n\ndismissing  the case.  On the same  day, the court granted to\n\nthe government fifteen days to file a detailed  memorandum of\n\nlaw in support of the motion to  dismiss that it had filed on\n\nFebruary 13.  Plaintiffs were given ten days to respond.  \n\n          On June 12, 1992, in compliance with the order, the\n\ngovernment  filed  the  more detailed  memorandum  of  law in\n\nsupport of  its motion  to dismiss.   On June  23, plaintiffs\n\nrequested  an additional  five  days  to  respond  ostensibly\n\nbecause plaintiffs' attorney was unable to find in his  files\n\na contemporaneous motion to dismiss.  The government contends\n\nthat  it  subsequently informed  plaintiffs' attorney  that a\n\ncopy of the motion  to dismiss filed on February 13, 1992 was\n\nto  accompany  its  memorandum  of  law  of  June  12.    The\n\n                             -3-\n\ngovernment   faxed  a  copy  of  the  motion  to  dismiss  to\n\nplaintiffs' attorney on June 24.\n\n          Approximately a month passed with no  response from\n\nplaintiffs.  On July 29,  1992, the government filed a motion\n\nto  adjudicate, asking  the  court to  dismiss the  case with\n\nprejudice because  plaintiffs had  failed to  respond to  its\n\nmotion  to dismiss twenty-nine business days after they filed\n\na request for an extension.\n\n          On  August  10,  1992,  plaintiffs filed  a  motion\n\nopposing the government's motion to adjudicate.   Plaintiffs'\n\nattorney claimed  he was not  informed until July 16  that he\n\nwas not  missing any of the government's  pleadings, and that\n\nhe had  been busy  with another jury  trial, but  expected to\n\ncomplete  an opposing  memorandum within  a day  or two.   On\n\nAugust  18,  1992,  plaintiffs  finally  filed  a  memorandum\n\nopposing the government's motion to dismiss.\n\n          By  that  time,  however,  the  district court  had\n\nalready entered an order dated August  12 dismissing the case\n\nwith prejudice for lack of prosecution.  Judgment was entered\n\non August 19, 1992.\n\n          On  August  25,  plaintiffs   filed  a  motion  for\n\nreconsideration.  They  argued that (1) they  had filed their\n\nmemorandum on August  18, before receiving the  court's order\n\ndated August 12 and before  judgment was entered; and (2) the\n\nessentials  of  plaintiffs'  opposition to  the  government's\n\n                             -4-\n\nmotion to dismiss  had been tendered in plaintiffs'  March 27\n\nmotion to vacate.\n\n          On October 22,  1992, the district court  issued an\n\norder  denying plaintiffs'  motion  for reconsideration,  but\n\nmodifying  the August  12, 1992  order  to dismissal  without\n\nprejudice.   Plaintiffs  appeal  from  the  district  court's\n\nOctober 22, 1992 order dismissing the case without prejudice.\n\n                             II.\n\n          Rule  41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\nexpressly  authorizes  a  district court  to  dismiss  a case\n\n\"[f]or failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or comply with .\n\n.  . any  order of  court.\"   Dismissal  with prejudice  is a\n                                                       \n\n\"harsh sanction,\" Richman  v.

We review  a district court's  dismissal for  lack of\n\nprosecution only for an abuse of discretion.

See de Casenave v. United States, No. 92-\n                                                    \n\n2102,  slip  op.  at  6  (1st Cir.

The\n\ncourt's  October 22  modification  of  its  August  12  order\n\ndismissing  the  case  from   \"with  prejudice\"  to  \"without\n\nprejudice\"  suggests  that  the  court  may  have  felt  that\n\nplaintiffs were  in a position to refile  their case.  Such a\n\nbelief  on the  court's part  would  be understandable  given\n\nplaintiffs' counsel's neglect, either before or after October\n\n22,  1992,  to  point  out  to  the  court  their limitations\n\nproblem.\n\n          Resolution of this appeal is not altogether simple.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorney's failure on two occasions to respond to\n\nplain  deadlines was egregious.   If  the district  court had\n\ndismissed with prejudice in these circumstances, we could not\n              \n\nsay  it  had  abused its  discretion.    However, by  finally\n\ndismissing without  prejudice, the  district  court seems  to\n                  \n\nhave  indicated  a  merciful  wish  not  to  visit  counsel's\n\ndereliction  upon  the  heads of  plaintiffs  by  barring the\n\naction altogether.   A district  court, which has  direct and\n\ncontinuous  contact with attorneys, is best  able to judge in\n\nthe  first  instance  whether  an  attorney's  misconduct  is\n\nsufficiently  egregious to  warrant the  \"death  knell\" of  a\n\n                             -7-\n\nlawsuit, see  Aoude v. Mobil  Oil Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534524\"><a href=\"/opinion/534524/salim-aoude-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1118\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir.  1989), or  whether some  lesser sanction  would be\n\nmore appropriate.\n\n          Given the  district court's action  in changing the\n\ndismissal  from  \"with\"   to  \"without\"  prejudice,   we  are\n\npersuaded to remand  to the same district judge  to allow him\n\nto decide  whether,  given the  surfacing of  the statute  of\n\nlimitations problem, he  wishes to give plaintiffs  a further\n\nchance  by allowing  the present  action to  proceed.   In so\n\nremanding,  we may be  criticized for overlooking plaintiffs'\n\nfailure to have  raised the limitations problem  below.  This\n\ncourt  will  not  ordinarily  consider  a  matter  not  first\n\npresented to the  district court.  E.g.,  Boston Celtics Ltd.\n                                                             \n\nPartnership v.

We,\n\ntherefore, vacate and remand, but emphasize that we leave the\n\nchoice entirely in the hands of the district court, which may\n\neither choose to confirm the  \"death knell\" of this action by\n\nreentry of  its previous  or some  other dismissal  order, or\n\nelse allow the case to proceed.  If the district court allows\n\nthe  case to  proceed, the  court may  wish to  assure itself\n\neither   that  present  counsel   will  in  the   future  act\n\nresponsibly  or that  new  counsel  will  be  substituted  by\n\nplaintiffs.  The court may  also consider whether to  impose,\n\n                             -8-\n\nas a condition to allowing  the case to go forward, pecuniary\n\nsanctions, to be  paid by present counsel  personally, and to\n\nsee that  present counsel does  not bill its own  clients for\n\ntime related to its ineffective and annoying conduct to date.\n\n          Vacated  and remanded  for  further proceedings  in\n                                                             \n\naccordance  herewith.
