On July  17, 1990\n                                        \n\nplaintiffs  Payless  Wholesale Distributors,  Inc. (Payless);\n\nL.A.  Formulations, Inc.  (LAF);  and Leonel  M. Lima  (Lima)\n\nfiled a  110 page first amended  complaint, containing twenty\n\ncauses  of action  against Alberto  Culver (P.R.),  Inc.; LSE\n\nSales Corp.; LSE Advertising Company; Alberto-Culver Company;\n\nand Leonard S.  Etten.  Monetary  damages were specified  for\n\neach cause, varying between $5 million and $150 million.  Out\n\nof abundance of caution, plaintiffs requested \"any additional\n\nrelief that this Honorable Court deem (sic) just and proper.\"\n\nThe  district court, quite properly, criticized the complaint\n\nfor not  being \"a  short and  plain statement\"  in accordance\n\nwith  Fed. R.  Civ. P. 8(a)(2).   Even more  justly, it could\n\nhave  complained of the flagrant violation of Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n11.1   The  amount of  damages sought  is a  relevant matter.\n\nSee Mestayer v. Wisconsin  Physicians Service Ins. Corp., 905\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1077, 1080  (7th Cir. 1990).   Cf.  Thorpe v.

Coupled\n              \n\nwith the extended complaint it would be difficult to think of\n\nclearer indifference to counsel's elementary obligations.\n\n          In  a  comprehensive   opinion  the  court  granted\n\ndefendants'  motion  to dismiss  nineteen  of  the causes  of\n\naction, and  then granted a  motion for summary  judgment for\n\n                    \n\n1.  \". . . The signature of  an attorney or party constitutes\na  certificate  [of] belief  . . .  it  is  well grounded  in\nfact. . . .\"\n\n                             -2-\n\ndefendants as to the  twentieth.  Happily, we need  not reach\n\nthe  correctness  of these  individual  rulings.   The  court\n\nshould have  recognized the defense of  judicial estoppel and\n\ndismissed  the complaint  at the  outset.   On that  basis we\n\naffirm.\n\n          According to the  complaint defendants were guilty,\n\ninter  alia,  of  violating  the  antitrust  and  RICO  laws,\n           \n\ntortious  interference with  contractual relations,  mail and\n\nwire   fraud,  conspiracy,  breach   of  contract,  fault  or\n\nnegligence, and damage to reputation, all  for the purpose of\n\ndriving  plaintiffs out  of business.2    By reason  of these\n\nalleged  wrongs Payless,  soon after  commencing  business in\n\nFebruary, 1986,  found itself having to  take various actions\n\nthat it  would not have  chosen.  Business  was unsuccessful,\n\nand in July, 1988  it filed for bankruptcy under  Chapter 11.\n\nIn  re  Payless  Wholesale  Distributors,  Inc., No.  88-0951\n                                               \n\n(Bankr. D.P.R. filed July 14, 1988).  In connection therewith\n\nthere were  requirements to give  reasons for filing,  and to\n\nlist  all debtor's  assets,  including claims  and causes  of\n\naction.3  In no filing did Payless even  vaguely refer to the\n\n                    \n\n2.  Strictly,  Payless  is  the one  business  entity  having\nclaims.  LAF was a manufacturer of products Payless  proposed\nto  sell,  and  Lima   a  mere  stockholder.    Neither   had\nindependent  rights.   Warth  v. Seldin,  422  U.S. 490,  499\n                                       \n(1975);  Jones v.  Niagara Frontier  Transp. Auth.,  836 F.2d\n                                                  \n731, 736 (2d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 825 (1988).\n                                     \n\n3.  11 U.S.C.    521(1), 1125(a).\n\n                             -3-\n\npresent claims, or  distinguish the  one defendant  mentioned\n\nfrom its other creditors,  yet Payless now alleges bankruptcy\n\nwas  \"a   direct  result   of  the  conspiratorial   acts  of\n\ndefendants.\"    First Am.  Complaint    98.   Even  a cursory\n\nexamination of  the claims shows that  defendants should have\n\nfigured in  both aspects of  the Chapter 11  proceedings, and\n\nthat  Payless   could  not  have  thought   otherwise.    The\n\nbrazenness of  its ambivalence is illustrated  by its present\n\nassertion that the statute of limitations had not run because\n\nit had been tolled by the pendency of Chapter 11.\n\n          The basic  principle of  bankruptcy is to  obtain a\n\ndischarge  from  one's  creditors  in return  for  all  one's\n\nassets, except  those exempt, as a result  of which creditors\n\nrelease their  own claims and  the bankrupt can  start fresh.\n\nAssuming there is validity in Payless's present suit,  it has\n\na  better plan.    Conceal  your  claims;  get  rid  of  your\n\ncreditors  on  the cheap,  and start  over  with a  bundle of\n\nrights.   This is  a palpable fraud  that the court  will not\n\ntolerate,  even  passively.   See,  e.g., In  re  H.R.P. Auto\n                                                             \n\nCenter,  Inc., 130 B.R.  247, 253-54 (Bankr.  N.D. Ohio 1991)\n             \n\n(collecting cases).  Payless, having obtained judicial relief\n\non  the representation  that no claims  existed, can  not now\n\nresurrect them and obtain relief on the opposite basis.  This\n\nmay  not  be  strictly   equitable  estoppel,  as  the  court\n\n                             -4-\n\nobserved.  Indeed, defendants may have  a windfall.  However,\n\nit is an unacceptable abuse of judicial proceedings.\n\n          It is  a generally recognized  proposition that one\n\ncannot  play \"fast  and  loose  with  the courts.\"    Patriot\n                                                             \n\nCinemas, Inc. v.

Here, \"the silence\" in the Oneida\n          bankruptcy record concerning this present\n          claim, as they say in the vernacular, \"is\n          deafening.\"\n\nId. at 417.\n  \n\n               In order to  preserve the  requisite\n          reliability of  disclosure statements and\n          to   provide   assurances  to   creditors\n          regarding  the  finality  of plans  which\n          they  have voted to approve, we hold that\n          under  the  facts  here present  Oneida's\n          failure to announce  this claim against a\n          creditor precludes it from litigating the\n          cause of action at this time.\n\nId. at 418.\n  \n\n                             -5-\n\n          By  noting,  and  then  disregarding  Oneida  Motor\n                                                             \n\nFreight, and  stating  that Payless's  \"disclosure  statement\n       \n\ndoes  not constitute the adoption of a position by Payless in\n\none  judicial proceeding  that is  intentionally inconsistent\n\nwith  its claims in this case\" the court failed to appreciate\n\nthe  long accepted  nature  of Payless's  obligations in  the\n\nChapter 11 proceeding.

Complaint    98.   Even  a cursory\n\nexamination of  the claims shows that  defendants should have\n\nfigured in  both aspects of  the Chapter 11  proceedings, and\n\nthat  Payless   could  not  have  thought   otherwise.    The\n\nbrazenness of  its ambivalence is illustrated  by its present\n\nassertion that the statute of limitations had not run because\n\nit had been tolled by the pendency of Chapter 11.\n\n          The basic  principle of  bankruptcy is to  obtain a\n\ndischarge  from  one's  creditors  in return  for  all  one's\n\nassets, except  those exempt, as a result  of which creditors\n\nrelease their  own claims and  the bankrupt can  start fresh.\n\nAssuming there is validity in Payless's present suit,  it has\n\na  better plan.    Conceal  your  claims;  get  rid  of  your\n\ncreditors  on  the cheap,  and start  over  with a  bundle of\n\nrights.   This is  a palpable fraud  that the court  will not\n\ntolerate,  even  passively.   See,  e.g., In  re  H.R.P. Auto\n                                                             \n\nCenter,  Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1817684\"><a href=\"/opinion/1817684/in-re-hrp-auto-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span>  <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 253-54 (Bankr.

Payless, having obtained judicial relief\n\non  the representation  that no claims  existed, can  not now\n\nresurrect them and obtain relief on the opposite basis.

However,\n\nit is an unacceptable abuse of judicial proceedings.\n\n          It is  a generally recognized  proposition that one\n\ncannot  play \"fast  and  loose  with  the courts.\"    Patriot\n                                                             \n\nCinemas, Inc. v.
