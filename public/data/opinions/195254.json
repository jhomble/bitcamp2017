Airport Detention\r          A.   Airport Detention\r                                \n\n          The facts are unremarkable up  until the point in  time\n\n    approximately 3:55  p.m.    when Nu ez was  first observed by\n\ntwo Customs agents, Olga  Silva and Victor Ramos, who  were \"pro-\n\nfiling  passengers\"  near the  American Airlines  ticket counter.\n\nAfter Nu ez attracted  their attention because he  appeared to be\n\nwalking  stiffly, the  agents  followed him  toward the  American\n\nAirlines  concourse,  and observed  as  he  cleared the  security\n\ncheckpoint  without incident.1  As Nu ez  placed his carry-on bag\n\non the floor  before presenting his  passport at the  Immigration\n\nand Naturalization Service (INS) checkpoint, Customs Agents Ramos\n\nand  Silva  noticed  several  bulges around  his  midsection  and\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     1Nu ez  walked through  the  metal detector  and passed  his\ncarry-on bag through the x-ray machine.\n\n                                2\r\n\nobserved  that he had difficulty  bending.  At  this point, Silva\n\nleft to summon Senior  Customs Investigator Isidro Rivera Sanchez\n\n(Rivera).\n\n          At approximately 4:10 p.m., Rivera approached  Nu ez at\n\nthe  INS checkpoint, identified  himself as a  Customs agent, and\n\nposed  a series  of perfunctory  questions.   At one  point, when\n\nNu ez  bent down to show Rivera his carry-on bag, Rivera observed\n\nthe  \"bulges\" seen by Silva and Ramos minutes before, and decided\n\nto question him further.  Rivera escorted Nu ez to a room off the\n\nmain concourse.   Seeking to  ensure that the  \"bulges\" were  not\n\nexplosives  that  might  have  gone undetected  at  the  security\n\ncheckpoint, Rivera  conducted a \"pat-down  frisk\" which  revealed\n\nthat  four  packages had  been  \"adapted\" to  fit  around Nu ez's\n\nmidsection.   Finding  no wires,  Rivera informed  Nu ez that  he\n\nwould be detained by Customs, then conducted him to a secure 8' x\n\n8' holding room in the customs enclosure.\n\n          As the case wended its way through the Customs chain of\n\ncommand, two more Customs agents  became involved:  Senior Super-\n\nvisory  Agent Carlos  Ruiz Hernandez  (Ruiz) and  his supervisor,\n\nSenior Agent Ben  Garcia (Garcia).   When Garcia  arrived on  the\n\nscene, he directed Ruiz to arrange for a drug-detection dog to be\n\nbrought to the customs enclosure.  Later, Garcia and Ruiz went to\n\nthe  holding room, where Garcia  informed Nu ez that  he was sus-\n\npected  of smuggling  contraband  and that  the Drug  Enforcement\n\nAdministration (DEA) was being  requested to secure a  warrant to\n\nsearch his person.   At  approximately 5:30 to  5:45 p.m,  Garcia\n\n                                3\r\n\nadministered Miranda warnings to Nu ez.  At approximately 5:45 to\r                              \n\n6:00 p.m., Ruiz attempted to arrange for a drug-detection dog.2\n\n          The situation inside  the holding  room changed  drama-\n\ntically as Ruiz was attending Nu ez while awaiting the arrival of\n\nthe drug-detection  dog.  Suddenly,  Nu ez spontaneously informed\n\nRuiz that  he had worked as an auto mechanic in New York but that\n\nwork was  scarce and \"times are tough    you  have to make a buck\n\nany way  you can.\"  As  Nu ez spoke, he slowly  began unbuttoning\n\nhis shirt.   Sensing that Nu ez was  preparing to shed the \"bulg-\n\nes,\"  Ruiz decided to \"give him the opportunity,\" and turned away\n\nwhile continuing to observe surreptitiously.  Shortly thereafter,\n\nRuiz heard a rustling  sound and glimpsed a series  of movements.\n\nWhen Ruiz turned toward  Nu ez, four packages lay near him on the\n\nfloor; it was approximately 6:30 p.m.\n\n          Ruiz immediately performed a field test, which indicat-\n\ned that the packages contained cocaine.   Nu ez was arrested.  At\n\nRuiz's instruction, Nu ez removed his unbuttoned shirt, revealing\n\ntwo  girdles and  the body imprints  left by the  packages he had\n\nbeen carrying  around his  midsection.   When  the passive  drug-\n\ndetection  dog finally  arrived  at approximately  7:00 p.m.,  it\n\n                    \r                              \n\n     2The record is silent as to whether any previous attempt had\nbeen  made to  obtain  a drug-detection  dog.   The  record  does\ndisclose,  however, that the  only dog  available at  the airport\nthat Sunday afternoon, \"Oby\", was used for luggage screening  and\nwas considered too dangerous  for use on a  human subject, as  it\nwas trained  to claw at  the spot  where it   detected narcotics.\n\"Zulu,\"  the nearest \"passive\"  drug-detection dog,  was kenneled\nforty-five minutes  from  the  airport.   Zulu  and  her  handler\narrived at the airport at approximately 7:00 p.m., about one-half\nhour after Nu ez was formally arrested.\n\n                                4\r\n\n\"alerted\"  in the area of Nu ez's midsection where the bulges had\n\nbeen concealed.\n\nB.   District Court Proceedings\r          B.   District Court Proceedings\r                                         \n\n          At  a pretrial  conference  on  June 15, 1992,  defense\n\ncounsel represented that he would move to suppress the contraband\n\nrecovered from the  floor of  the detention room.   The  district\n\ncourt accordingly  entered a pretrial  order pursuant to  Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 12(c),  setting   June 22 as the  deadline for  pretrial\n\nmotions and July 29 as the trial date.  No motion to suppress was\n\nfiled  within the  prescribed period.   On July 23,  however, six\n\ndays before  trial, the government informed  defense counsel that\n\nit would introduce newly discovered evidence relating to the pre-\n\narrest admission by Nu ez, which Customs Agent Ruiz only recently\n\nhad brought to  the prosecutor's  attention.  See  supra at  p.4.\r                                                                  \n\nThe  next day, five days  before trial, defense  counsel moved to\n\nsuppress both the Nu ez admission and the contraband.  The motion\r                       \n\nsimply contended that the contraband was the inadmissible product\n\nof  a pretextual  investigatory stop,  but asserted  no challenge\n\nbased on the duration of the detention.\n\n          On the  morning of  July 29, 1992, after  jury empanel-\r                                                                           \n\nment,  the  district court  heard  argument  on the  government's\r              \n\nobjection based on the untimeliness of the motion to suppress the\n\ncontraband.  The  government argued that  the relevant facts  had\n\nbeen known  to the defense from  the beginning and that  any sup-\n\npression  challenge to the contraband had  been waived under Fed.\n\n                                5\r\n\nR.  Crim. P. 12(f).3   Asked to  explain the untimeliness  of the\n\nmotion,  defense counsel  represented  to the  court that  Nu ez,\n\nagainst counsel's advice  and perhaps  without comprehending  the\n\nfull implications, had instructed counsel not to move to suppress\n\nthe contraband but later changed his mind.\n\n          Without ruling on  the government's waiver  claim under\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(f), relating to the untime-\n\nliness of  the motion  to suppress the  contraband, the  district\n\ncourt  proceeded  to  consider the  contraband-suppression  claim\n\nbased  on the allegedly pretextual pat-down frisk.4  Near the end\r                                                           \n\nof  the  suppression  hearing  itself,  however, defense  counsel\n\ninsinuated  the  new contention  that  the  contraband should  be\n\nsuppressed  either on the basis  of the pretextual pat-down frisk\n\nor  an  unconstitutionally  prolonged  detention.5    The  latter\n                    \r                              \n\n     3Given the timing of its disclosure, however, the government\nconceded  the  timeliness of  the  motion to  suppress  the Nu ez\nadmission  to Ruiz.   Nu ez  has not  appealed from  the district\ncourt ruling denying the motion to suppress the admission.\n\n     4The  district  court  thus  tacitly  allowed  argument  and\nevidence on  the contraband-suppression issue, which  it had been\nled  to understand  turned on  the allegedly  pretextual pat-down\r                                                                           \nfrisk,  the only  claim  raised in  the  motion to  suppress  the\r                                                                           \ncontraband.\r                    \n\n     5During  cross-examination of  the  Customs agents,  defense\ncounsel  elicited testimony relating to the frisk and the ensuing\ndetention.  Then, in a staccato presentation  near the end of the\nsuppression hearing,  defense counsel     for  the first  time   \nbriefly  injected the claim  that the  excessive duration  of the\ndetention had  tainted the  voluntariness of Nu ez'  surrender of\nthe contraband.   With the  empaneled jury waiting,  the district\ncourt simply noted  the customs agents' testimony  that Nu ez had\nbeen detained pending the  issuance of a warrant  authorizing the\nDEA  to search his person.   Defense counsel  then countered that\nthe government had presented no evidence that the agents had even\nattempted to obtain  a warrant.  Thereupon, the court's attention\n\n                                6\r\n\ntheory had neither  been raised in the motion  to suppress nor at\n\nthe post-empanelment argument upon which the district court based\n\nits tacit  decision to permit hearing  on the contraband-suppres-\n\nsion  claim based  on  the theory  that  the pat-down  frisk  was\n\nunconstitutional.   See supra  notes 4 &amp;  5.  As  a direct conse-\r                                       \n\nquence  of  the belated  insinuation  of the  prolonged-detention\n\nclaim, the district court's attention was never fairly focused on\n\nthe principal contraband-suppression theory presently advanced on\n\nappeal.6 \n\n                                II\r                                          II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \n\nA.   Duration of Detention\r          A.   Duration of Detention\r                                    \n\n          We  first  consider   whether  the  suppression  theory\n\nclearly asserted for the first time on appeal    that the surren-\n\nder of  the contraband was  the product of  an unconstitutionally\n\nprolonged detention    was waived.  Criminal Rule 12(f) provides:\n\n\"Failure by a party  to raise defenses  or objections or to  make\n\nrequests which  must be made prior  to trial, at the  time set by\r                                                      \n\nthe  court pursuant to subdivision (c), or prior to any extension\n                    \r                              \n\nwas once again  abruptly drawn back to  the legality of  the pat-\ndown frisk.  Ultimately, the court denied the motion to suppress,\nin its entirety, without  stating any \"essential findings\" relat-\ning  to the duration of the  detention as contemplated by Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 12(e).\n\n     6The  principal  by-products  of these  scattershot  defense\ntactics are the absence of  factual findings on matters essential\nto reliable appellate review of the  district court's ruling that\nthe surrender of the contraband was voluntary, and the absence of\nany  ruling or finding whatever  as to the  reasonableness of the\ndetention itself.

In\r              \n\nthis  vein,  it  is  instructive to  contrast  the  circumstances\n\nsurrounding the late requests to suppress  the contraband and the\n\nNu ez  admission.

As our court clearly explained in Barletta, 644 F.2d\r                                                                 \n\nat  54-55:\n\n          Were a defendant able  to delay such a motion\n          until trial, he  could prevent the government\n          from appealing, thus frustrating  the central\n          purpose  of   3731.   It  is for  this reason\n          that motions to suppress     motions based on\n          the exclusionary rule  alone    must  be made\n          by a defendant prior to trial or not at  all,\n          and for  this reason as well  that a district\n          court ordinarily may not  defer a ruling on a\n          defendant's  motion  to suppress.    We agree\n          with the district court that such rulings and\n          the  government's ability to  appeal them are\n          at the core of 12(e).\n\nUnder these  circumstances, therefore, relief from  waiver of the\n\nNu ez suppression  claim based on  the duration of  the detention\n\nwill  not be  implied.

Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7\r                                                            \n(1989) (totality  of circumstances  must be considered  in deter-\nmining whether  there was \"reasonable suspicion\"  for Terry stop,\r                                                                     \nwhich must be based on \"articulable facts that criminal  activity\n'may be afoot,' even if  the officer lacks probable cause.\")   In\naddition, the district court specifically credited testimony that\ncertain explosive  devices could have gone  undetected when Nu ez\npassed through the airport security checkpoint.  Considering that\nthese events  took  place in  the  environs of  an  international\nairport where drug  trafficking has been  a common occurrence  in\nrecent years,  see, e.g., United  States v.

Sec. 841(a)(1).  On appeal, Nunez challenges the district court's refusal to suppress the contraband obtained during his detention by the United States Customs Service (Customs) at Luis Marin International Airport in Carolina, Puerto Rico, on Sunday, May 24, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Airport Detention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are unremarkable up until the point in time--approximately 3:55 p.m.--when Nunez was first observed by two Customs agents, Olga Silva and Victor Ramos, who were \"profiling passengers\" near the American Airlines ticket counter.  After Nunez attracted their attention because he appeared to be walking stiffly, the agents followed him toward the American Airlines concourse, and observed as he cleared the security checkpoint without incident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  As Nunez placed his carry-on bag on the floor before presenting his passport at the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) checkpoint, Customs Agents Ramos and Silva noticed several bulges around his midsection and observed that he had difficulty bending.  At this point, Silva left to summon Senior Customs Investigator Isidro Rivera Sanchez (Rivera).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 4:10 p.m., Rivera approached Nunez at the INS checkpoint, identified himself as a Customs agent, and posed a series of perfunctory questions.  At one point, when Nunez bent down to show Rivera his carry-on bag, Rivera observed the \"bulges\" seen by Silva and Ramos minutes before, and decided to question him further.  Rivera escorted Nunez to a room off the main concourse.  Seeking to ensure that the \"bulges\" were not explosives that might have gone undetected at the security checkpoint, Rivera conducted a \"pat-down frisk\" which revealed that four packages had been \"adapted\" to fit around Nunez's midsection.  Finding no wires, Rivera informed Nunez that he would be detained by Customs, then conducted him to a secure 8' X 8' holding room in the customs enclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the case wended its way through the Customs chain of command, two more Customs agents became involved:  Senior Supervisory Agent Carlos Ruiz Hernandez (Ruiz) and his supervisor, Senior Agent Ben Garcia (Garcia).  When Garcia arrived on the scene, he directed Ruiz to arrange for a drug-detection dog to be brought to the customs enclosure.  Later, Garcia and Ruiz went to the holding room, where Garcia informed Nunez that he was suspected of smuggling contraband and that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was being requested to secure a warrant to search his person.  At approximately 5:30 to 5:45 p.m., Garcia administered Miranda warnings to Nunez.  At approximately 5:45 to 6:00 p.m., Ruiz attempted to arrange for a drug-detection dog.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation inside the holding room changed dramatically as Ruiz was attending Nunez while awaiting the arrival of the drug-detection dog.  Suddenly, Nunez spontaneously informed Ruiz that he had worked as an auto mechanic in New York but that work was scarce and \"times are tough--you have to make a buck any way you can.\"   As Nunez spoke, he slowly began unbuttoning his shirt.  Sensing that Nunez was preparing to shed the \"bulges,\" Ruiz decided to \"give him the opportunity,\" and turned away while continuing to observe surreptitiously.  Shortly thereafter, Ruiz heard a rustling sound and glimpsed a series of movements.  When Ruiz turned toward Nunez, four packages lay near him on the floor;  it was approximately 6:30 p.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ruiz immediately performed a field test, which indicated that the packages contained cocaine.  Nunez was arrested.  At Ruiz's instruction, Nunez removed his unbuttoned shirt, revealing two girdles and the body imprints left by the packages he had been carrying around his midsection.  When the passive drug-detection dog finally arrived at approximately 7:00 p.m., it \"alerted\" in the area of Nunez's midsection where the bulges had been concealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. District Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a pretrial conference on June 15, 1992, defense counsel represented that he would move to suppress the contraband recovered from the floor of the detention room.  The district court accordingly entered a pretrial order pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(c), setting June 22 as the deadline for pretrial motions and July 29 as the trial date.  No motion to suppress was filed within the prescribed period.  On July 23, however, six days before trial, the government informed defense counsel that it would introduce newly discovered evidence relating to the pre-arrest admission by Nunez, which Customs Agent Ruiz only recently had brought to the prosecutor's attention.  See supra at p. 720.  The next day, five days before trial, defense counsel moved to suppress both the Nunez admission and the contraband.  The motion simply contended that the contraband was the inadmissible product of a pretextual investigatory stop, but asserted no challenge based on the duration of the detention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of July 29, 1992, after jury empanelment, the district court heard argument on the government's objection based on the untimeliness of the motion to suppress the contraband.  The government argued that the relevant facts had been known to the defense from the beginning and that any suppression challenge to the contraband had been waived under Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(f).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Asked to explain the untimeliness of the motion, defense counsel represented to the court that Nunez, against counsel's advice and perhaps without comprehending the full implications, had instructed counsel not to move to suppress the contraband but later changed his mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without ruling on the government's waiver claim under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(f), relating to the untimeliness of the motion to suppress the contraband, the district court proceeded to consider the contraband-suppression claim based on the allegedly pretextual pat-down frisk.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Near the end of the suppression hearing itself, however, defense counsel insinuated the new contention that the contraband should be suppressed either on the basis of the pretextual pat-down frisk or an unconstitutionally prolonged detention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The latter theory had neither been raised in the motion to suppress nor at the post-empanelment argument upon which the district court based its tacit decision to permit hearing on the contraband-suppression claim based on the theory that the pat-down frisk was unconstitutional.  See supra notes 4 &amp; 5.  As a direct consequence of the belated insinuation of the prolonged-detention claim, the district court's attention was never fairly focused on the principal contraband-suppression theory presently advanced on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Duration of Detention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider whether the suppression theory clearly asserted for the first time on appeal--that the surrender of the contraband was the product of an unconstitutionally prolonged detention--was waived.  Criminal Rule 12(f) provides:  \"Failure by a party to raise defenses or objections or to make requests which must be made prior to trial, at the time set by the court pursuant to subdivision (c), or prior to any extension thereof made by the court, shall constitute waiver thereof, but the court for cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(f) (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See United States v. Gomez, 770 F.2d 251, 253 (1st Cir.1985) (Rule 12 implements an \"important social policy\";  waiver results absent compliance);  see also Brooks v. United States, 416 F.2d 1044, 1047-48 (5th Cir.1969) (same), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 840, 91 S.Ct. 81, 27 L.Ed.2d 75 (1970).  The record reflects that the district court neither found \"cause\" nor granted relief from waiver under Rule 12(f).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though appellate courts on occasion have implied relief from waiver under Rule 12(f) where the trial court proceeds to address the suppression issue on the merits, see, e.g., United States v. Vasquez, 858 F.2d 1387, 1389 (9th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1034, 109 S.Ct. 847, 102 L.Ed.2d 978 (1989);  contra United States v. Oldfield, 859 F.2d 392, 396-98 (6th Cir.1988), we have not had occasion, nor are we disposed, sua sponte, to conjure relief from waiver under Rule 12(f) in circumstances where no cause for relief appears and the district court record does not enable reliable appellate review on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it would make Rules 12(b)(3) and (f) meaningless were an unexplained change of mind on the part of the defendant deemed \"cause\" for relief from waiver, following jury empanelment, under a rule fundamental to orderly pretrial procedure.  In this vein, it is instructive to contrast the circumstances surrounding the late requests to suppress the contraband and the Nunez admission.  The government's failure to disclose the Nunez admission until shortly before trial provided a paradigmatic example of \"cause\" for relief from waiver under Rule 12(f).  See, e.g., United States v. Lamela, 942 F.2d 100, 104 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that a Rule 12(b)(2) motion first asserted at trial was not time-barred where the relevant information did not become available until trial).  On the other hand, no extrinsic justification whatever is suggested for the belated request to suppress the contraband due to the duration of the detention even though all the relevant facts were known to the defense from the outset.   Instead, the untimeliness is attributed exclusively to Nunez's original decision not to challenge the contraband.  In these circumstances, we believe something more than an unexplained change of mind must be shown to warrant relief from a Rule 12(f) waiver brought on by the defendant's tactical decision.  See United States v. Gonzales, 749 F.2d 1329, 1336 (9th Cir.1984) (upholding denial of relief from waiver under Rule 12(f) after defendant changed mind about whether to move to suppress).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Rule 12 itself provides that the court shall not defer a pretrial motion for determination at trial, even for \"good cause\" shown, \"if a party's right to appeal is adversely affected.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e).  \"Once a jury has been sworn and jeopardy attaches, the government loses its right to appeal an adverse ruling on suppression.\"  United States v. Taylor, 792 F.2d 1019, 1025 (11th Cir.1986) (scope of discretion to grant relief under Rule 12(f) narrows once jeopardy has attached), citing 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3731,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> cert. denied sub nom.  King v. United States, 481 U.S. 1030, 107 S.Ct. 1957, 95 L.Ed.2d 530 (1987).  See United States v. Barletta, 644 F.2d 50, 54 (1st Cir.1981) (Coffin, C.J.)  (\"[D]efendants' motions to suppress, based on the exclusionary rule, are at the heart of the legislative purpose in providing government appeal rights.\").  On the other hand, the defense tactic employed below would have insulated from pretrial review, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3731, any exclusionary ruling based on the duration of the detention.  As our court clearly explained in Barletta, 644 F.2d at 54-55:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>Were a defendant able to delay such a motion until trial, he could prevent the government from appealing, thus frustrating the central purpose of Sec. 3731.  It is for this reason that motions to suppress--motions based on the exclusionary rule alone--must be made by a defendant prior to trial or not at all, and for this reason as well that a district court ordinarily may not defer a ruling on a defendant's motion to suppress.  We agree with the district court that such rulings and the government's ability to appeal them are at the core of 12(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, therefore, relief from waiver of the Nunez suppression claim based on the duration of the detention will not be implied.  See id. at 54;  see also, e.g., United States v. Gomez-Benabe, 985 F.2d 607, 611-12 (1st Cir.1993) (finding Rule 12(f) waiver and concluding that:  \"[i]t is unnecessary to address the substantive aspects of appellant's arguments [that should have been raised in a pretrial motion to suppress] since appellant has totally failed to put the matter in issue.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>B. Pat-down Frisk</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Nunez argues that the pat-down frisk conducted by Customs was pretextual--a search for contraband rather than a security frisk for weapons--and that the contraband subsequently recovered by Customs therefore should have been suppressed under Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963).  Nunez insists that the Customs agents could not have apprehended a genuine security risk warranting a pat-down frisk for weapons at the INS checkpoint because he had just passed through the security checkpoint without incident.  See supra note 1.  Furthermore, he argues, the Customs agents would have searched his carry-on bag as well were they genuinely concerned for their personal security as the government asserts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court is required to assess \"the totality of the circumstances\" confronting the officers, rather than dissecting the evidence and weighing the individual components.  United States v. Trullo, 809 F.2d 108, 111 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 482 U.S. 916, 107 S.Ct. 3191, 96 L.Ed.2d 679 (1987).  We review its factual findings under the \"clear error\" standard, United States v. Kiendra, 663 F.2d 349, 351 (1st Cir.1981);  see also United States v. Walker, 924 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1991) (pat-down frisk), and will uphold the suppression ruling if supported by \"any reasonable view of the evidence,\" United States v. Young, 877 F.2d 1099, 1100 (1st Cir.1989) (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court based its findings principally on the agents' testimony concerning the reasons for the pat-down frisk.  Trial court credibility determinations are prime candidates for appellate deference.  See United States v. Brum, 948 F.2d 817, 819 (1st Cir.1991);  cf. Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).  The suppression hearing transcript discloses abundant support for the district court finding that the pat-down frisk was based on a reasonable concern, on the part of the agents, for their own security and for the safety of airline passengers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  As the record evidence supports the district court's reasoned conclusion, there was no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Nunez walked through the metal detector and passed his carry-on bag through the x-ray machine</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record is silent as to whether any previous attempt had been made to obtain a drug-detection dog.  The record does disclose, however, that the only dog available at the airport that Sunday afternoon, \"Oby\", was used for luggage screening and was considered too dangerous for use on a human subject, as it was trained to claw at the spot where it detected narcotics.  \"Zulu,\" the nearest \"passive\" drug-detection dog, was kenneled forty-five minutes from the airport.  Zulu and her handler arrived at the airport at approximately 7:00 p.m., about one-half hour after Nunez was formally arrested</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Given the timing of its disclosure, however, the government conceded the timeliness of the motion to suppress the Nunez admission to Ruiz.  Nunez has not appealed from the district court ruling denying the motion to suppress the admission</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court thus tacitly allowed argument and evidence on the contraband-suppression issue, which it had been led to understand turned on the allegedly pretextual pat-down frisk, the only claim raised in the motion to suppress the contraband</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> During cross-examination of the Customs agents, defense counsel elicited testimony relating to the frisk and the ensuing detention.  Then, in a staccato presentation near the end of the suppression hearing, defense counsel--for the first time--briefly injected the claim that the excessive duration of the detention had tainted the voluntariness of Nunez' surrender of the contraband.  With the empaneled jury waiting, the district court simply noted the customs agents' testimony that Nunez had been detained pending the issuance of a warrant authorizing the DEA to search his person.  Defense counsel then countered that the government had presented no evidence that the agents had even attempted to obtain a warrant.  Thereupon, the court's attention was once again abruptly drawn back to the legality of the pat-down frisk.  Ultimately, the court denied the motion to suppress, in its entirety, without stating any \"essential findings\" relating to the duration of the detention as contemplated by Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The principal by-products of these scattershot defense tactics are the absence of factual findings on matters essential to reliable appellate review of the district court's ruling that the surrender of the contraband was voluntary, and the absence of any ruling or finding whatever as to the reasonableness of the detention itself.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Rule 12(b)(3) mandates that all motions to suppress be presented prior to trial;  Rule 12(c) empowers the court, by rule or order, to prescribe time limits for filing Rule 12 motions.

Sec. 3731 reads as follows:</p>\n        <p>An appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision or order of a district courts [sic] suppressing or excluding evidence or requiring the return of seized property in a criminal proceeding, not made after the defendant has been put in jeopardy and before the verdict or finding on an indictment or information.... (footnote omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Few courts have squarely considered whether a Rule 12(f) waiver obviates \"plain error\" review under Rule 52(b).  See, e.g., United States v. Howard, 998 F.2d 42, 52 (2d Cir.1993);  but see Gomez-Benabe, 985 F.2d at 611-12.   A number of courts have proceeded with \"plain error\" review, however, without discussing the impact of the Rule 12(f) waiver.  See, e.g., United States v. Gio, 7 F.3d 1279, 1285 (7th Cir.1993) (severance claim waived under Rule 12(f) reviewed for plain error);  United States v. Milian-Rodriguez, 828 F.2d 679, 684 (11th Cir.1987) (same, motion to suppress), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1054, 108 S.Ct. 2820, 100 L.Ed.2d 921 (1988).  In a different context, we have suggested that \"plain error\" review may be required, notwithstanding waiver.  See, e.g., United States v. Cyr, 712 F.2d 729, 735 n. 4 (1st Cir.1983) (noting that reversal on severance claim waived under Rule 12(f) would be \"mandated only if there is plain error.\")  (dicta).  In any event, our precedent does not require \"plain error\" review in circumstances where reliable review has been rendered impossible by inadequate development at the district court level and the exclusionary-rule suppression issue pressed on appeal was not broached below until after jeopardy attached.  See Barletta, 644 F.2d at 54-55.   See also United States v. Davenport, 986 F.2d 1047, 1048 (7th Cir.1993)</p>\n        <p>The record in this case would not enable a reliable appellate determination as to the reasonableness of the Custom's agents' actions in light of all the relevant circumstances prevailing at the time.  See, e.g., United States v. Quinn, 815 F.2d 153, 157-58 (1st Cir.1987).  Although the record certainly is susceptible to the interpretation that approximately two hours elapsed before Nunez was formally arrested, it is neither \"obvious\" nor \"clear,\" see United States v. Olano, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), for instance, that the actual circumstances confronting the officers did not render the detention reasonable;  that the detention did not constitute a reasonable border detention;  or, indeed, that the officers did not have probable cause at some point prior to the formal arrest.  Thus, Nunez has not met the burden of proving plain error, even assuming such review were appropriate in the wake of the deliberate Rule 12(f) waiver.  See United States v. Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1993) (\"[E]rror cannot be 'clear' or 'obvious' unless the desired factual finding is the only one supported by the record below.\");  United States v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir.1977) (\"Appellant's failure to raise the issue below means that a critical factual dispute remains unsolved.  We cannot find plain error on this silent record.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Agent Rivera testified that there was no need to search the carry-on bag at the security checkpoint, because the officers would have Nunez within their direct physical control and, unlike a weapon concealed on his person, he would not be able to remove a gun from his carry-on bag before the officers could subdue him.  We believe Rivera's testimony was sufficient to dispel the misgivings raised by Nunez</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Nunez's nervous behavior, the stiff manner in which he walked, the difficulty in bending, and the bulges underneath his clothing were sufficient to raise a reasonable suspicion in the minds of experienced law enforcement officers that Nunez was carrying contraband.  See United States  v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (totality of circumstances must be considered in determining whether there was \"reasonable suspicion\" for Terry stop, which must be based on \"articulable facts that criminal activity 'may be afoot,' even if the officer lacks probable cause.\")   In addition, the district court specifically credited testimony that certain explosive devices could have gone undetected when Nunez passed through the airport security checkpoint.  Considering that these events took place in the environs of an international airport where drug trafficking has been a common occurrence in recent years,  see, e.g., United States v. Villanueva, 15 F.3d 197, 199 (1st Cir.1994) (noting history of area where defendants were stopped is relevant factor in \"reasonable suspicion\" calculus), we believe the district court supportably found that these agents reasonably harbored a justifiable concern for their personal safety and/or the safety of airline passengers, sufficient to warrant the pat-down frisk for weapons and for any explosives which may have passed undetected through the INS checkpoint</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Sec. 841(a)(1).  On appeal, Nunez challenges the district court's refusal to suppress the contraband obtained during his detention by the United States Customs Service (Customs) at Luis Marin International Airport in Carolina, Puerto Rico, on Sunday, May 24, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Airport Detention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are unremarkable up until the point in time--approximately 3:55 p.m.--when Nunez was first observed by two Customs agents, Olga Silva and Victor Ramos, who were \"profiling passengers\" near the American Airlines ticket counter.  After Nunez attracted their attention because he appeared to be walking stiffly, the agents followed him toward the American Airlines concourse, and observed as he cleared the security checkpoint without incident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  As Nunez placed his carry-on bag on the floor before presenting his passport at the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) checkpoint, Customs Agents Ramos and Silva noticed several bulges around his midsection and observed that he had difficulty bending.  At this point, Silva left to summon Senior Customs Investigator Isidro Rivera Sanchez (Rivera).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 4:10 p.m., Rivera approached Nunez at the INS checkpoint, identified himself as a Customs agent, and posed a series of perfunctory questions.  At one point, when Nunez bent down to show Rivera his carry-on bag, Rivera observed the \"bulges\" seen by Silva and Ramos minutes before, and decided to question him further.  Rivera escorted Nunez to a room off the main concourse.  Seeking to ensure that the \"bulges\" were not explosives that might have gone undetected at the security checkpoint, Rivera conducted a \"pat-down frisk\" which revealed that four packages had been \"adapted\" to fit around Nunez's midsection.  Finding no wires, Rivera informed Nunez that he would be detained by Customs, then conducted him to a secure 8' X 8' holding room in the customs enclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the case wended its way through the Customs chain of command, two more Customs agents became involved:  Senior Supervisory Agent Carlos Ruiz Hernandez (Ruiz) and his supervisor, Senior Agent Ben Garcia (Garcia).  When Garcia arrived on the scene, he directed Ruiz to arrange for a drug-detection dog to be brought to the customs enclosure.  Later, Garcia and Ruiz went to the holding room, where Garcia informed Nunez that he was suspected of smuggling contraband and that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was being requested to secure a warrant to search his person.  At approximately 5:30 to 5:45 p.m., Garcia administered Miranda warnings to Nunez.  At approximately 5:45 to 6:00 p.m., Ruiz attempted to arrange for a drug-detection dog.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation inside the holding room changed dramatically as Ruiz was attending Nunez while awaiting the arrival of the drug-detection dog.  Suddenly, Nunez spontaneously informed Ruiz that he had worked as an auto mechanic in New York but that work was scarce and \"times are tough--you have to make a buck any way you can.\"   As Nunez spoke, he slowly began unbuttoning his shirt.  Sensing that Nunez was preparing to shed the \"bulges,\" Ruiz decided to \"give him the opportunity,\" and turned away while continuing to observe surreptitiously.  Shortly thereafter, Ruiz heard a rustling sound and glimpsed a series of movements.  When Ruiz turned toward Nunez, four packages lay near him on the floor;  it was approximately 6:30 p.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ruiz immediately performed a field test, which indicated that the packages contained cocaine.  Nunez was arrested.  At Ruiz's instruction, Nunez removed his unbuttoned shirt, revealing two girdles and the body imprints left by the packages he had been carrying around his midsection.  When the passive drug-detection dog finally arrived at approximately 7:00 p.m., it \"alerted\" in the area of Nunez's midsection where the bulges had been concealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. District Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a pretrial conference on June 15, 1992, defense counsel represented that he would move to suppress the contraband recovered from the floor of the detention room.  The district court accordingly entered a pretrial order pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(c), setting June 22 as the deadline for pretrial motions and July 29 as the trial date.  No motion to suppress was filed within the prescribed period.  On July 23, however, six days before trial, the government informed defense counsel that it would introduce newly discovered evidence relating to the pre-arrest admission by Nunez, which Customs Agent Ruiz only recently had brought to the prosecutor's attention.  See supra at p. 720.  The next day, five days before trial, defense counsel moved to suppress both the Nunez admission and the contraband.  The motion simply contended that the contraband was the inadmissible product of a pretextual investigatory stop, but asserted no challenge based on the duration of the detention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of July 29, 1992, after jury empanelment, the district court heard argument on the government's objection based on the untimeliness of the motion to suppress the contraband.  The government argued that the relevant facts had been known to the defense from the beginning and that any suppression challenge to the contraband had been waived under Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(f).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Asked to explain the untimeliness of the motion, defense counsel represented to the court that Nunez, against counsel's advice and perhaps without comprehending the full implications, had instructed counsel not to move to suppress the contraband but later changed his mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without ruling on the government's waiver claim under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(f), relating to the untimeliness of the motion to suppress the contraband, the district court proceeded to consider the contraband-suppression claim based on the allegedly pretextual pat-down frisk.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Near the end of the suppression hearing itself, however, defense counsel insinuated the new contention that the contraband should be suppressed either on the basis of the pretextual pat-down frisk or an unconstitutionally prolonged detention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The latter theory had neither been raised in the motion to suppress nor at the post-empanelment argument upon which the district court based its tacit decision to permit hearing on the contraband-suppression claim based on the theory that the pat-down frisk was unconstitutional.  See supra notes 4 &amp; 5.  As a direct consequence of the belated insinuation of the prolonged-detention claim, the district court's attention was never fairly focused on the principal contraband-suppression theory presently advanced on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Duration of Detention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider whether the suppression theory clearly asserted for the first time on appeal--that the surrender of the contraband was the product of an unconstitutionally prolonged detention--was waived.  Criminal Rule 12(f) provides:  \"Failure by a party to raise defenses or objections or to make requests which must be made prior to trial, at the time set by the court pursuant to subdivision (c), or prior to any extension thereof made by the court, shall constitute waiver thereof, but the court for cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(f) (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See United States v.

The record reflects that the district court neither found \"cause\" nor granted relief from waiver under Rule 12(f).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though appellate courts on occasion have implied relief from waiver under Rule 12(f) where the trial court proceeds to address the suppression issue on the merits, see, e.g., United States v.

In this vein, it is instructive to contrast the circumstances surrounding the late requests to suppress the contraband and the Nunez admission.  The government's failure to disclose the Nunez admission until shortly before trial provided a paradigmatic example of \"cause\" for relief from waiver under Rule 12(f).  See, e.g., United States v. Lamela, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566806\"><a href=\"/opinion/566806/united-states-v-jose-juan-lamela-united-states-of-america-v-james-david/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 104 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that a Rule 12(b)(2) motion first asserted at trial was not time-barred where the relevant information did not become available until trial).  On the other hand, no extrinsic justification whatever is suggested for the belated request to suppress the contraband due to the duration of the detention even though all the relevant facts were known to the defense from the outset.   Instead, the untimeliness is attributed exclusively to Nunez's original decision not to challenge the contraband.  In these circumstances, we believe something more than an unexplained change of mind must be shown to warrant relief from a Rule 12(f) waiver brought on by the defendant's tactical decision.  See United States v. Gonzales, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"445284\"><a href=\"/opinion/445284/united-states-v-esteban-leon-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1329</span></a></span>, 1336 (9th Cir.1984) (upholding denial of relief from waiver under Rule 12(f) after defendant changed mind about whether to move to suppress).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Rule 12 itself provides that the court shall not defer a pretrial motion for determination at trial, even for \"good cause\" shown, \"if a party's right to appeal is adversely affected.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e).  \"Once a jury has been sworn and jeopardy attaches, the government loses its right to appeal an adverse ruling on suppression.\"  United States v.

(\"[D]efendants' motions to suppress, based on the exclusionary rule, are at the heart of the legislative purpose in providing government appeal rights.\").  On the other hand, the defense tactic employed below would have insulated from pretrial review, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3731, any exclusionary ruling based on the duration of the detention.  As our court clearly explained in Barletta, 644 F.2d at 54-55:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>Were a defendant able to delay such a motion until trial, he could prevent the government from appealing, thus frustrating the central purpose of Sec. 3731.  It is for this reason that motions to suppress--motions based on the exclusionary rule alone--must be made by a defendant prior to trial or not at all, and for this reason as well that a district court ordinarily may not defer a ruling on a defendant's motion to suppress.  We agree with the district court that such rulings and the government's ability to appeal them are at the core of 12(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, therefore, relief from waiver of the Nunez suppression claim based on the duration of the detention will not be implied.  See id. at 54;  see also, e.g., United States v. Gomez-Benabe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600256\"><a href=\"/opinion/600256/united-states-v-miguel-gomez-benabe/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span>, 611-12 (1st Cir.1993) (finding Rule 12(f) waiver and concluding that:  \"[i]t is unnecessary to address the substantive aspects of appellant's arguments [that should have been raised in a pretrial motion to suppress] since appellant has totally failed to put the matter in issue.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>B.

Nunez insists that the Customs agents could not have apprehended a genuine security risk warranting a pat-down frisk for weapons at the INS checkpoint because he had just passed through the security checkpoint without incident.  See supra note 1.

The suppression hearing transcript discloses abundant support for the district court finding that the pat-down frisk was based on a reasonable concern, on the part of the agents, for their own security and for the safety of airline passengers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  As the record evidence supports the district court's reasoned conclusion, there was no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Nunez walked through the metal detector and passed his carry-on bag through the x-ray machine</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record is silent as to whether any previous attempt had been made to obtain a drug-detection dog.

Then, in a staccato presentation near the end of the suppression hearing, defense counsel--for the first time--briefly injected the claim that the excessive duration of the detention had tainted the voluntariness of Nunez' surrender of the contraband.  With the empaneled jury waiting, the district court simply noted the customs agents' testimony that Nunez had been detained pending the issuance of a warrant authorizing the DEA to search his person.  Defense counsel then countered that the government had presented no evidence that the agents had even attempted to obtain a warrant.  Thereupon, the court's attention was once again abruptly drawn back to the legality of the pat-down frisk.  Ultimately, the court denied the motion to suppress, in its entirety, without stating any \"essential findings\" relating to the duration of the detention as contemplated by Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The principal by-products of these scattershot defense tactics are the absence of factual findings on matters essential to reliable appellate review of the district court's ruling that the surrender of the contraband was voluntary, and the absence of any ruling or finding whatever as to the reasonableness of the detention itself.

The Trojan Horse tactic employed by the defense below virtually ensured that its suppression claim based on the duration of the detention would escape serious focus from the government and the court at the post-empanelment suppression hearing, see supra notes 4, 5 &amp; 6, thereby circumventing the time bar fixed in the pretrial order, see supra note 7, the \"cause\" showing required for relief from waiver under Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(f), and the government's right to compel resolution of the contraband-suppression claim prior to trial in order to preserve its right to pretrial review under 18 U.S.C.

See, e.g., United States v. Howard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610900\"><a href=\"/opinion/610900/united-states-v-lehman-howard-also-known-as-slim-joseph-koontz-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 52 (2d Cir.1993);  but see Gomez-Benabe, 985 F.2d at 611-12.   A number of courts have proceeded with \"plain error\" review, however, without discussing the impact of the Rule 12(f) waiver.  See, e.g., United States v. Gio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"655526\"><a href=\"/opinion/655526/united-states-v-nicholas-gio-and-joseph-marchiafava/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1279</span></a></span>, 1285 (7th Cir.1993) (severance claim waived under Rule 12(f) reviewed for plain error);  United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></span> (1988).  In a different context, we have suggested that \"plain error\" review may be required, notwithstanding waiver.  See, e.g., United States v. Cyr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421810\"><a href=\"/opinion/421810/united-states-v-marie-v-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span>, 735 n. 4 (1st Cir.1983) (noting that reversal on severance claim waived under Rule 12(f) would be \"mandated only if there is plain error.\")  (dicta).  In any event, our precedent does not require \"plain error\" review in circumstances where reliable review has been rendered impossible by inadequate development at the district court level and the exclusionary-rule suppression issue pressed on appeal was not broached below until after jeopardy attached.  See Barletta, 644 F.2d at 54-55.   See also United States v. Davenport, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600781\"><a href=\"/opinion/600781/united-states-v-james-davenport/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1047</span></a></span>, 1048 (7th Cir.1993)</p>\n        <p>The record in this case would not enable a reliable appellate determination as to the reasonableness of the Custom's agents' actions in light of all the relevant circumstances prevailing at the time.  See, e.g., United States v. Quinn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485654\"><a href=\"/opinion/485654/united-states-v-daniel-j-quinn/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 157-58 (1st Cir.1987).  Although the record certainly is susceptible to the interpretation that approximately two hours elapsed before Nunez was formally arrested, it is neither \"obvious\" nor \"clear,\" see United States v. Olano, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993), for instance, that the actual circumstances confronting the officers did not render the detention reasonable;  that the detention did not constitute a reasonable border detention;  or, indeed, that the officers did not have probable cause at some point prior to the formal arrest.  Thus, Nunez has not met the burden of proving plain error, even assuming such review were appropriate in the wake of the deliberate Rule 12(f) waiver.  See United States v. Olivier-Diaz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195103\"><a href=\"/opinion/195103/united-states-v-olivier/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1993) (\"[E]rror cannot be 'clear' or 'obvious' unless the desired factual finding is the only one supported by the record below.\");  United States v.

We believe Rivera's testimony was sufficient to dispel the misgivings raised by Nunez</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Nunez's nervous behavior, the stiff manner in which he walked, the difficulty in bending, and the bulges underneath his clothing were sufficient to raise a reasonable suspicion in the minds of experienced law enforcement officers that Nunez was carrying contraband.  See United States  v. Sokolow, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112239\"><a href=\"/opinion/112239/united-states-v-sokolow/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112239\"><a href=\"/opinion/112239/united-states-v-sokolow/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Considering that these events took place in the environs of an international airport where drug trafficking has been a common occurrence in recent years,  see, e.g., United States v. Villanueva, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195178\"><a href=\"/opinion/195178/united-states-v-villanueva/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 199 (1st Cir.1994) (noting history of area where defendants were stopped is relevant factor in \"reasonable suspicion\" calculus), we believe the district court supportably found that these agents reasonably harbored a justifiable concern for their personal safety and/or the safety of airline passengers, sufficient to warrant the pat-down frisk for weapons and for any explosives which may have passed undetected through the INS checkpoint</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
