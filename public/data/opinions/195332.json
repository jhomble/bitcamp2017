On January 12, 1993, Teijidos de\n                          \n\nCoamo, Inc. (\"the Company\") filed this suit in district court\n\nagainst the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union  and\n\none  of  its  locals   (collectively,  \"the  Unions\").    The\n\ncomplaint, premised  on section 301 of  the Taft-Hartley Act,\n\n29 U.S.C.     185,  sought  a declaration  that  no  contract\n\nexisted  between the Company and  the Unions; and the Company\n\nalso  requested  a stay  of pending  arbitration proceedings.\n\nThe district  court granted  a stay  pendente  lite, and  the\n                                                   \n\nUnions appealed.  We  vacate the stay and remand  for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                              I.\n\n     Well before the  current law suit,  the Company and  the\n\nUnions  were parties  to  a  collective bargaining  agreement\n\ncovering  the  Company's  knit,  cut, and  sew  employees  at\n\nBarranquitas, Puerto Rico.  That contract expired on February\n\n29, 1992.  Thereafter, on April 17, 1992, the parties entered\n\ninto a  \"summary of agreement\" looking toward a new contract.\n\nIt is enough  for present  purposes to say  that the  Company\n\nbelieves  that no effective contract was adopted at that time\n\nor thereafter;  the Unions, by  contrast, take the  view that\n\n(based on past practice  and the summary of agreement)  a new\n\ncontract  did  go into  effect on  or  after April  17, 1992,\n\nretroactive to February 1, 1992, and is currently in force.\n\n                             -2-\n\n     On November 5,  1992, the Unions requested  arbitration,\n\nbefore arbitrator  David  Helfeld, of  a  dispute  concerning\n\naccess   for   union   representatives   to   the   Company's\n\nBarranquitas mill.   The Company agreed;  its explanation for\n\nagreeing is  that the contract  that expired on  February 29,\n\n1992, had provided for  arbitration of disputes arising under\n\nthat  agreement and that the access dispute dated back to the\n\nperiod before the contract expired.  The arbitrator scheduled\n\na hearing for December 7, 1992.\n\n     On or about November  30, 1992, the Unions  learned that\n\nsome  of the  Company's  employees desired  to decertify  the\n\nUnions as the representative  of the Barranquitas workers and\n\nwere preparing to petition the National Labor Relations Board\n\nfor  a new  election.   In early  December 1992  there was  a\n\nstrike and certain employees  were disciplined by the Company\n\nfor  what it said was strike and picket-line misconduct.  The\n\nUnions then  sought arbitration before  arbitrator Helfeld of\n\nthese disciplinary disputes.  The Company objected that there\n\nwas  no contract  and thus  no basis  for arbitration  of new\n\ndisputes arising after February 29, 1992.\n\n     The arbitrator held a hearing  on December 30, 1992, and\n\nadvised the parties  that he would  determine whether he  had\n\nauthority to  proceed.   The Company  then filed  the present\n\nlawsuit on January 12, 1993; the complaint sought, as already\n\nnoted, a judicial declaration  that no contract existed after\n\n                             -3-\n\nFebruary  29,  1992, a  determination  that  would strip  the\n\narbitrator of  power at  least as to  disputes arising  after\n\nthat date.    The Company also sought a  judicial stay of the\n\narbitration while the contract  issue was being determined by\n\nthe court.\n\n     On January 20, 1993, a magistrate judge denied a stay of\n\nthe  arbitration  proceedings.     On January  27,  1993, the\n\narbitrator  issued  a   decision  finding  that  a   contract\n\ncurrently  existed between  the Company  and the Unions.   He\n\nproposed to schedule additional hearings on the merits of the\n\ndisputes.    The  Company  appealed  the  magistrate  judge's\n\ndecision and  also asked the  district court to  stay further\n\narbitration proceedings  pending the  court's decision  as to\n\nwhether the arbitrator had authority to proceed.  \n\n     On  June 21,  1993,  the district  court  issued a  stay\n\npendente lite of arbitration as to grievances alleged to have\n             \n\narisen  after February 29, 1992.   The Unions  then filed the\n\npresent  appeal  to  this court.    So far  as  we  have been\n\nadvised, the district court has not yet determined the merits\n\nof the dispute  and we  are concerned only  with the  Unions'\n\nclaim  that   interim  relief--reflected   in  the   stay  of\n\narbitration--was improperly granted.\n\n                             II.\n\n     On this appeal, the  first question presented is whether\n\nwe  have  jurisdiction  to  review the  stay  of  arbitration\n\n                             -4-\n\ngranted  by the district court as  either a final order or an\n\nappealable interlocutory injunction.  The Company  has raised\n\nthis issue by  motion to  dismiss the appeal.   Clearly,  the\n\ndistrict court's stay is not a final disposition of the case.\n\nBut  we  agree  with the  Unions  that  it  is an  appealable\n\ninterlocutory injunction.\n\n     The governing statute, 28  U.S.C.   1292(a)(1), provides\n\nfor  immediate  appeals of  interlocutory orders  of district\n\ncourts \"granting . . . [or]  refusing . . . injunctions.\"  An\n\norder staying an arbitration proceedings is in substance, and\n\noften  in form,  a  directive to  the  parties to  cease  the\n\narbitration.  It  is thus  injunctive in character,  A. &amp;  E.\n                                                             \n\nPlastik Pak  Co. v. Monsanto Co., 396 F.2d 710, 713 (9th Cir.\n                                \n\n1968), and one might  think that there could be  little doubt\n\nthat such an order was immediately appealable.  \n\n     The  doubts,  such as  they  are, stem  from  two facts.\n\nFirst, several  circuits, including this one,  have held that\n\nan order  refusing to stay  an arbitration proceeding  is not\n\nimmediately  appealable  under   28  U.S.C.      1292(a)(1).1\n\nSecond,  in a series of decisions beginning with one by Judge\n\nFriendly in  the Lummus  case,2 the  Second Circuit  has gone\n                       \n\n                    \n\n     1E.g., New England Power Co. v. Asiatic Petroleum Corp.,\n                                                            \n456 F.2d 183, 185 (1st Cir. 1972); Stateside Machinery Co. v.\n                                                          \nAlperin, 526 F.2d 480, 482-84 (3d Cir. 1975).\n       \n\n     2Lummus Co.  v. Commonwealth Oil  Ref. Co., 297  F.2d 80\n                                               \n(2d Cir. 1961),  cert. denied,  368 U.S. 986  (1962).   Later\n                             \nSecond Circuit cases  are listed in 16 Wright, Miller, Cooper\n\n                             -5-\n\nfurther  and  held  that  an  order  staying  an  arbitration\n\nproceedings  also  is  not  immediately  appealable under  28\n\nU.S.C.    1292.  The Company argues that the Second Circuit's\n\napproach is  supported  by  considerations  of  symmetry  and\n\npolicy.\n\n     The Second Circuit appears to stand alone.  At least six\n\nother  circuits  treat an  order  staying  arbitration as  an\n\ninjunction  that  is   immediately  appealable.3    Our   own\n\ndecision in Societe Generale v. Raytheon  European Management\n                                                             \n\nand  Systems  Co., 643  F.2d 863  (1st Cir.  1981), tenuously\n                 \n\ndistinguished by the  Company, leans in the direction  of the\n\nmajority rule.   A 1988 amendment to  the Federal Arbitration\n\nAct,  now  9  U.S.C.    16(a)(2)--although  perhaps  formally\n\ninapplicable  to this case--expresses  a congressional policy\n\nin  favor  of immediate  appeal  of  \"an interlocutory  order\n\ngranting . . .  an injunction against an arbitration  that is\n\nsubject to this title.\"4\n\n                    \n\n&amp;  Gressman, Federal  Practice and  Procedure    3923, at  60\n                                             \n(1977). \n\n     3The circuits  are  the Fifth,  Sixth, Seventh,  Eighth,\nNinth, Tenth, Eleventh,  and the District of Columbia.  E.g.,\n                                                            \nTimberlake v. Oppenheimer  &amp; Co., Inc., 729  F.2d 515, 518-19\n                                      \n(7th Cir. 1984); see 16 Wright, supra,   3923 (1977 and  1994\n                                     \nSupp.). \n\n     4The  arbitration  title   broadly  covers   arbitration\nclauses  in  maritime  agreements  or  agreements  evidencing\ntransactions involving interstate commerce, 9 U.S.C.   2, but\nit  excludes \"contracts of employment\" from its scope.  Id.  \n                                                           \n1; see Paperworkers Co. v. Misco, 484 U.S. 29, 40 n.9 (1987).\n                                \n\n                             -6-\n\n     Judge  Friendly's  views   are  never   lightly  to   be\n\ndisregarded.   However, his  main concern in  Lummus was with\n                                                    \n\n\"the  baneful effect\"  of  permitting appeals  from \"order[s]\n\nrefusing  a stay  of arbitration.\"   297 F.2d  at 86.   As he\n\nexplained,  immediate   appeals   from  such   orders   would\n\ncompromise   the  speedy,   informal  disposition   at  which\n\narbitration  agreements  aim.    Id.    Judge  Friendly  then\n                                   \n\nconcluded  that,  as  a  matter  of  symmetry, \"if  an  order\n\nrefusing a stay\" is deemed not to be  an injunction, then \"an\n\norder granting such  a stay\"  also cannot  be so  classified.\n\nId.  \n   \n\n     Courts since Lummas have  been willing to entertain just\n                        \n\nsuch  a   distinction  between   orders  granting   stays  of\n\narbitration and orders denying them.  Perhaps the best way to\n\nexplain this  outcome is to  say that both  orders constitute\n\ninjunctions   but  that   the  policy   favoring  arbitration\n\nprecludes an  immediate appeal  where the district  court has\n\nrefused a stay.    New England Power Co.,  supra, 456 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n186.  After all,  treating procedure as a special  concern of\n\nthe  courts,  judges  have  not hesitated  to  embroider  the\n\nJudicial Code  with other judge-made rules  on appealability.\n\nE.g., Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541\n                                               \n\n(1949).    \n\n     Accordingly we  believe that an order  declining to stay\n\nan arbitration is an injunction but for policy reasons is not\n\n                             -7-\n\nimmediately   reviewable  by   appeal,  although   of  course\n\nfundamental  objections to the  arbitration are preserved for\n\nlater judicial review  if an award is made.   By contrast, an\n\norder  staying   arbitration  is   an   injunction  that   is\n\nimmediately  appealable under  28 U.S.C.     1292(a)(1), even\n\nwhere  section 16  of  the Federal  Arbitration Act  does not\n\napply  to the particular order.  We thus have jurisdiction to\n\nreview the district court's stay order in this case, and turn\n\nnow to  the question whether the district court had authority\n\nto grant such a stay.\n\n                             III.\n\n     The Unions claim  that the stay granted  by the district\n\ncourt was an injunction issued in violation of the  stringent\n\nrequirements  of section  7 of  the Norris-LaGuardia  Act, 29\n\nU.S.C.   107.   In the  alternative, the Union says  that the\n\nstay was unjustified even  under the less stringent equitable\n\nstandards  that govern  ordinary  injunctions.   For  reasons\n\nalready  indicated  we  agree  that  the  stay  comprised  an\n\ninjunction.    The  next,  and more  difficult,  question  is\n\nwhether section 7 supplies the yardstick.\n\n     Section  7 is one of a set of interlocking provisions of\n\nthe Norris-LaGuardia Act designed to curb the use of  federal\n\ncourt injunctions  in cases  \"involving or  growing out  of a\n\n                             -8-\n\nlabor  dispute.\"5   Under  section  7, no  injunction  may be\n\nissued  in such a  case except after  an evidentiary hearing,\n\nspecified  findings by  the  court, and  certain other  steps\n\nincluding  a bond.   The  required findings  include findings\n\nthat absent an injunction \"substantial and irreparable injury\n\nto  complainant's  property  will  follow\"  and  that  public\n\nofficers  \"are  unable  or   unwilling  to  furnish  adequate\n\nprotection.\"  Id.\n                 \n\n     The threshold  question, where section 7  is invoked, is\n\nwhether the case derives  from a \"labor dispute,\"  a critical\n\nphrase that  provides  the outer  boundary  for much  of  the\n\nNorris-LaGuardia Act.  On  the face of the matter,  a dispute\n\nbetween  an employer  and its  unions involving  arbitration,\n\nplant access, discipline of  employees, and the existence vel\n                                                             \n\nnon  of a  collective  bargaining agreement  does comprise  a\n   \n\nlabor dispute,  taking that phrase literally.   The pertinent\n\ndefinitions in  the  statute are  broad, see  section 13,  29\n                                            \n\n                    \n\n     5Section 1 of the statute  says that federal courts have\nno  jurisdiction to  issue  temporary  restraining orders  or\ninjunctions in such cases  except in \"strict conformity\" with\nthe statute; section  4 prohibits  any temporary  restraining\norder or  injunction against certain acts  (e.g., refusing to\n                                                \nwork) regardless  of  circumstances; and  section  7  imposes\nsevere conditions on the grant of injunctive relief  where it\nis not  barred outright by section 4.  29 U.S.C.    101, 104,\n107.\n\n                             -9-\n\nU.S.C.   113, and  have been broadly construed by  the courts\n\nincluding the Supreme Court.6  \n\n     While the Supreme Court has been unwilling to narrow the\n\ndefinition of  \"labor dispute,\"  it  has carved  out a  quite\n\nimportant set  of exceptions  to the Norris-LaGuardia  Act in\n\nrelation to  arbitration.   Following the  Taft-Hartley Act's\n\ncreation  of contract  suits under  section 301,  the Supreme\n\nCourt upheld an injunction requiring an employer to arbitrate\n\na dispute, as  the employer  and union had  agreed.

At least where these objectives coincide, as in\n\nLincoln  Mills and Boys Markets, we are told that the Norris-\n                               \n\nLaGuardia  Act's \"seemingly  absolute terms\"  can be  made to\n\nyield to \"the subsequently enacted provisions of   301(a) . .\n\n. and the purposes of arbitration.\"  Boys Markets, supra, 398\n                                                        \n\nU.S. at 249-50.  We do not think that in this case injunctive\n\nrelief  can  be  justified  on either  ground--to  enforce  a\n\ncontract or support arbitration--let alone both.\n\n     It  requires  no  argument  to  show that  the  stay  of\n\narbitration  granted in  this case  is  not a  step fostering\n\narbitration.   Nor can the stay fairly be described as one to\n\nenforce  a  collective bargaining  agreement.   The Company's\n       \n\nposition,  after all, is that  there is no  such agreement at\n\nall.  The Company is seeking not to enforce a contract but to\n\nobtain  a judicial determination that none exists.  This is a\n\n                             -11-\n\npermissible aim but it  is rather far from  the circumstances\n\nof Lincoln Mills and Boys Market.\n                                \n\n     The Company's  argument for  bypassing section 7  is not\n\nwithout some force.  It points out that whatever the strength\n\nof  the policy  favoring arbitration  of labor  disputes, the\n\nobligation  to  arbitrate  remains a  creature  of  contract.\n\nUnited Steelworkers of  America v. Warrior  &amp; Gulf Nav.  Co.,\n                                                            \n\n363 U.S. 574, 582 (1960).    Thus, there is no  obligation to\n\narbitrate if  the parties  did not agree  to do  so.  Id.   A\n                                                             \n\nfortiori there is no  obligation to arbitrate if  the parties\n        \n\ndid  not  agree to  anything,  as  the  Company claims  here.\n\nIndeed, in AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers,\n                                                            \n\n475  U.S. 643  (1986), the  Supreme Court  held that  a court\n\ncannot  order arbitration  without  a  judicial finding  that\n\nthere is an agreement providing for it.  \n\n     But AT&amp;T Technologies, although heavily stressed  by the\n                          \n\nCompany,  does  not  directly  govern  our  case.   Here  the\n\narbitration clause invoked by  the Unions does not require  a\n\ncourt order:   an  arbitrator being already  designated under\n\nthe alleged  contract--that is,  the prior contract  that the\n\nUnions claim  to have  been extended--the Unions  could begin\n\nthe process without cooperation from the Company or aid  from\n\nthe  courts.  It is the  Company that has taken the offensive\n\nand  sought to  preempt  the arbitration.    Nothing in  AT&amp;T\n                                                             \n\nTechnologies addresses the question whether section 7 applies\n            \n\n                             -12-\n\nto  injunctive  relief  when  an employer  seeks  to  preempt\n\narbitration.\n\n     Taking  a very  broad  view, one  could  argue that  the\n\nLincoln Mills policy of  issuing injunctions to enforce labor\n             \n\ncontracts should entail an  equal willingness to help parties\n\navoid  spurious claims that a contract exists.  It might also\n\nbe argued  that, despite the Norris-LaGuardia  Act's sweeping\n\nlanguage,  the  primary  concerns  that  it  had  with  labor\n\ninjunctions involved conduct such as lawful strikes, peaceful\n\npicketing and union organizing which are very remote from the\n\nconduct--a  disputed  arbitration  proceeding--sought  to  be\n\nstayed in this case.  These are not frivolous arguments.\n\n      On  the  other  hand,   the  judicial  virtues  include\n\nrespecting  statutory language,  and section  7 seems  on its\n\nface  to  apply to  our  case.   The  Lincoln Mills  and Boys\n                                                             \n\nMarkets  cases  are  distinguishable  because  they  involved\n       \n\naffirmative enforcement of collective bargaining contracts in\n\nsupport of arbitration.   Also, what law can  be found in the\n\ncircuits  may lean slightly in favor of the view that section\n\n7 does apply here:  the Ninth Circuit has so held, as did the\n\nThird (though by  a two-to-one vote); and  the Second Circuit\n\ncases  that look  in the opposite  direction do  not directly\n\ndiscuss our issue.7\n\n                    \n\n     7Compare Camping Constr.

Carving out new exceptions\n\nto the Norris-LaGuardia Act,  or markedly extending old ones,\n\nis primarily a matter for the Supreme Court.  We think such a\n\nstep is entirely possible; but we do  not think it so certain\n\nthat we should anticipate  it.  Modern labor law,  after all,\n\nis  largely a construct of Congress, the Labor Board, and the\n\nSupreme Court.  The edifice does not need another architect.\n\n                             IV.\n\n     To say  that section  7 applies  is not  the end  of the\n\nmatter.  The central findings  and procedures required for an\n\ninjunction under section 7 differ from those required for  an\n\nordinary  injunction,8 but only by degree and in detail.  The\n\nmost important findings required by and peculiar to section 7\n\nare that \"unlawful acts\" be threatened, that \"substantial and\n\nirreparable injury  to  complainant's property\"  will  follow\n\nabsent an injunction, and  that \"public officers\" \"are unable\n\n                    \n\nCir.  1993) (same  by a  divided court),  with  Diamond Glass\n                                                             \nCorp.  v.

That reading, however, goes slightly\n\nbeyond the  precise  words of  the statute.   Further,  there\n\nwould  be some tension  between such a view  of section 7 and\n\nthe Supreme Court's willingness  to uphold injunctions in aid\n\nof contractually  promised  arbitration (Lincoln  Mills)  and\n                                                       \n\neven against peaceful strikes (Boys Markets).  \n                                           \n\n     Having given the term  \"labor disputes\" a broad reading,\n\nwe see good  reason to  preserve at least  the potential  for\n\ninjunctive  relief  where  unlawful  (but  non-violent)  acts\n\nthreaten to  cause  \"substantial and  irreparable injury\"  to\n\nsome  property-like interest (other  than physical security).\n\nThere is even legislative history in the Norris-LaGuardia Act\n\nto  the  effect  that  Congress  did  not  mean  to  preclude\n\ninjunctive  relief against \"unlawful acts or acts of fraud or\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n     9Section 7  also requires  findings that the  balance of\nharms as to each element of the injunction be in favor of the\ncomplainant and  that complainant lack an  adequate remedy at\nlaw;  but these are  requirements that normally  apply to any\ninjunction.\n\n                             -15-\n\nviolence.\"10    If  the  balance  of  harms  and  irreparable\n\ninjury requirements are taken seriously, little danger exists\n\nof promiscuous injunctions under section 7.\n\n     This  danger   is   further   reduced   by   two   other\n\nconsiderations.  First,  no matter what threats  or harms are\n\npresented, section 4--except as limited by the Supreme court-\n\n-creates  an unqualified  \"no injunction\"  zone for  the core\n\nconduct  of  striking, organizing  in unions,  and picketing.\n\nSecond,  where  the  conduct  falls outside  that  zone,  the\n\nsubstantive  findings required  by  section 7  are backed  by\n\nprocedural  requirements  that go  beyond  those of  ordinary\n\ninjunctions  (e.g., an  evidentiary  hearing and  a bond  for\n                  \n\ncosts and attorney's fees).\n\n     In this case, we  do not think that either  the findings\n\nor the  procedural requirements of section  7 were satisfied.\n\nThe district court may have assimilated a stay of arbitration\n\nto  a stay of  a phase of  its own proceedings,  for which no\n\nfindings of any  kind would  be required.   But despite  some\n\nsimilarities,  the stay  of arbitration  is a  coercive order\n\ndirected not at the  court's own proceedings but at  the out-\n\nof-court activities  of parties before  the court.   That, in\n\nfact,  is why the stay  is an injunction  appealable under 28\n\nU.S.C.   1292(a).\n\n                    \n\n     10S. Rep.  No.  163,  72d  Cong., 1st  Sess.  11  (1932)\n(emphasis added); see Grace Co. v. Williams, 96 F.2d 478, 481\n                                            \n(8th Cir. 1938), recounting the legislative history.\n\n                             -16-\n\n     Here,   starting  with  procedure,  the  district  court\n\napparently omitted  the  requirement that  no  injunction  be\n\ngranted except  \"after hearing the testimony  of witnesses in\n\nopen  court  (with the  opportunity  for cross-examination),\"\n\nsection 7;  nor were there  separate formal findings  of fact\n\ncovering  the  issues  for  which  section  7  requires  such\n\nfindings;11 nor does it  appear that bond was filed  to cover\n\ndamages  including  attorney's   fees,  as  section  7   also\n\nrequires.  There may be  cases where one or another of  these\n\nprocedural  requirements   is  waived  or   its  omission  is\n\nmanifestly harmless;  but the  lack  of substantive  findings\n\ncannot be so easily ignored.\n\n     Turning  to  substance,  we  do  not  think  that  it is\n\napparent how the lack of an injunction threatened the Company\n\nwith substantial and irreparable injury.  In this  court, the\n\nonly claim made  by the Company under  this head is  that the\n\narbitration  proceedings  would be  used  by  the Unions  \"as\n\ncampaign propaganda  in a  decertification  election.\"   This\n\nassertion is not explained  in the brief, and it  is scarcely\n\n                    \n\n     11Section 7 requires five findings.   The first four are\nthat  unlawful  acts  are threatened,  that  substantial  and\nirreparable injury  will follow, that the balance  of harm on\neach  element  of relief  favors  the  complainant, and  that\ncomplainant  has  no  adequate  remedy at  law.    The  fifth\nfinding,  that public  officers  are unable  or unwilling  to\nfurnish protection,  is (as  we read the  statute) irrelevant\nwhere  the harm is not  of a kind  that the police ordinarily\nprevent.\n\n                             -17-\n\nself-evident that the arbitration proceedings  would or would\n\neven be likely to alter the election results.  \n\n     If the concern is with  relief that the arbitrator might\n\norder,  the short  answer  is that  the  award is  not  self-\n\nexecuting.    A  valid  objection to  jurisdiction  would  be\n\npresented  to and decided by  the court before  the award was\n\nimplemented.   As for any  propaganda benefit accruing to the\n\nUnions from  the  existence of  the arbitration  or even  the\n\narbitrator's  findings,  the  Company  is  no  less  free  to\n\npublicize its own  claim that the  arbitration is a  nullity,\n\npointing to  its declaratory  judgment suit as  evidence that\n\nthe challenge is a serious one.  \n\n     In its district court papers the Company argued that  it\n\nneeded a  stay to forestall  a hopeless predicament:   either\n\nparticipate in the arbitration \"and risk waiving its right to\n\njudicial   determination  of   the   issue   of   substantive\n\narbitrability\" or decline to participate and be  bound by the\n\naward if the arbitrator  is later held to have  jurisdiction.\n\nNot surprisingly,  no authority was cited  for the suggestion\n\nthat  the   Company  would   waive  an   explicitly  asserted\n\njurisdictional  objection by  defending on  the merits.   The\n\nsuggestion is mistaken.   E.g., IAM  Lodge 1777 v.  Garsteel,\n                                                             \n\nInc., 900 F.2d 1005, 1008-10 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 111 S.\n                                                     \n\nCt. 143 (1990).  \n\n                             -18-\n\n     It is true  that participating would  cause one form  of\n\nloss, namely, the  time and expense of litigation  before the\n\narbitrator.  But courts have ordinarily not deemed litigation\n\nexpense to be  substantial and irreparable  injury warranting\n\nan  injunction, Renegotiation  Board v.

If the Bannercraft generalization may have some\n                                \n\nexceptions, nothing here makes this case appear exceptional.\n\n     In sum, so far as appears  from this record, there is no\n\nsubstantial and  irreparable injury--or at least  injury of a\n\nkind  that  courts  recognize  in injunction  cases.    Under\n\nordinary standards for injunctive relief,  irreparable injury\n\nis nominally required but courts are often generous where the\n\ncomplainant's  claim   on  the  merits  is   very  strong  or\n\nunanswerable.   Under section  7, however,  there is  no such\n\ngenerosity.   Absent a supported finding  of \"substantial and\n\nirreparable injury,\" the stay of arbitration cannot stand.\n\n                              V.\n\n     This case is not over.  The Company's complaint sought a\n\ndeclaration that there was no collective bargaining agreement\n\nin force after  February 29,  1992, and so  no obligation  to\n\narbitrate disputes arising after that date.  Although section\n\n301 actions are ordinarily  brought to enforce contracts, the\n\n                             -19-\n\nDeclaratory Judgment  Act, 28 U.S.C.     2201-02, permits the\n\ndeclaration of rights about  which a real controversy exists,\n\nand  the  Unions  have  not  disputed  the  district  court's\n\nauthority to grant  declaratory relief.   Nor does section  7\n\npose any barrier to  such a declaration; it is  directed only\n\nagainst injunctions.

Perceived  judicial  abuses gave  rise  to  severe\n\nrestrictions   on   federal   court   authority;    and   the\n\nrestrictions,  being  statutory,   persist  even  though  the\n\nclimate  that led to abuses has altered.  Courts have assumed\n\na  lot of  authority in  recent years,  but the  authority to\n\nrepeal statutes still belongs to Congress.\n\n     The stay of arbitration granted by the district court is\n\nvacated and the  case is remanded for further  proceedings on\n                                 \n\nthe request for declaratory relief.\n\n                             -20-\n",

On January 12, 1993, Teijidos de\n                          \n\nCoamo, Inc. (\"the Company\") filed this suit in district court\n\nagainst the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union  and\n\none  of  its  locals   (collectively,  \"the  Unions\").    The\n\ncomplaint, premised  on section 301 of  the Taft-Hartley Act,\n\n29 U.S.C.     185,  sought  a declaration  that  no  contract\n\nexisted  between the Company and  the Unions; and the Company\n\nalso  requested  a stay  of pending  arbitration proceedings.\n\nThe district  court granted  a stay  pendente  lite, and  the\n                                                   \n\nUnions appealed.  We  vacate the stay and remand  for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                              I.\n\n     Well before the  current law suit,  the Company and  the\n\nUnions  were parties  to  a  collective bargaining  agreement\n\ncovering  the  Company's  knit,  cut, and  sew  employees  at\n\nBarranquitas, Puerto Rico.  That contract expired on February\n\n29, 1992.  Thereafter, on April 17, 1992, the parties entered\n\ninto a  \"summary of agreement\" looking toward a new contract.\n\nIt is enough  for present  purposes to say  that the  Company\n\nbelieves  that no effective contract was adopted at that time\n\nor thereafter;  the Unions, by  contrast, take the  view that\n\n(based on past practice  and the summary of agreement)  a new\n\ncontract  did  go into  effect on  or  after April  17, 1992,\n\nretroactive to February 1, 1992, and is currently in force.\n\n                             -2-\n\n     On November 5,  1992, the Unions requested  arbitration,\n\nbefore arbitrator  David  Helfeld, of  a  dispute  concerning\n\naccess   for   union   representatives   to   the   Company's\n\nBarranquitas mill.   The Company agreed;  its explanation for\n\nagreeing is  that the contract  that expired on  February 29,\n\n1992, had provided for  arbitration of disputes arising under\n\nthat  agreement and that the access dispute dated back to the\n\nperiod before the contract expired.  The arbitrator scheduled\n\na hearing for December 7, 1992.\n\n     On or about November  30, 1992, the Unions  learned that\n\nsome  of the  Company's  employees desired  to decertify  the\n\nUnions as the representative  of the Barranquitas workers and\n\nwere preparing to petition the National Labor Relations Board\n\nfor  a new  election.   In early  December 1992  there was  a\n\nstrike and certain employees  were disciplined by the Company\n\nfor  what it said was strike and picket-line misconduct.  The\n\nUnions then  sought arbitration before  arbitrator Helfeld of\n\nthese disciplinary disputes.  The Company objected that there\n\nwas  no contract  and thus  no basis  for arbitration  of new\n\ndisputes arising after February 29, 1992.\n\n     The arbitrator held a hearing  on December 30, 1992, and\n\nadvised the parties  that he would  determine whether he  had\n\nauthority to  proceed.   The Company  then filed  the present\n\nlawsuit on January 12, 1993; the complaint sought, as already\n\nnoted, a judicial declaration  that no contract existed after\n\n                             -3-\n\nFebruary  29,  1992, a  determination  that  would strip  the\n\narbitrator of  power at  least as to  disputes arising  after\n\nthat date.    The Company also sought a  judicial stay of the\n\narbitration while the contract  issue was being determined by\n\nthe court.\n\n     On January 20, 1993, a magistrate judge denied a stay of\n\nthe  arbitration  proceedings.     On January  27,  1993, the\n\narbitrator  issued  a   decision  finding  that  a   contract\n\ncurrently  existed between  the Company  and the Unions.   He\n\nproposed to schedule additional hearings on the merits of the\n\ndisputes.    The  Company  appealed  the  magistrate  judge's\n\ndecision and  also asked the  district court to  stay further\n\narbitration proceedings  pending the  court's decision  as to\n\nwhether the arbitrator had authority to proceed.  \n\n     On  June 21,  1993,  the district  court  issued a  stay\n\npendente lite of arbitration as to grievances alleged to have\n             \n\narisen  after February 29, 1992.   The Unions  then filed the\n\npresent  appeal  to  this court.    So far  as  we  have been\n\nadvised, the district court has not yet determined the merits\n\nof the dispute  and we  are concerned only  with the  Unions'\n\nclaim  that   interim  relief--reflected   in  the   stay  of\n\narbitration--was improperly granted.\n\n                             II.\n\n     On this appeal, the  first question presented is whether\n\nwe  have  jurisdiction  to  review the  stay  of  arbitration\n\n                             -4-\n\ngranted  by the district court as  either a final order or an\n\nappealable interlocutory injunction.  The Company  has raised\n\nthis issue by  motion to  dismiss the appeal.   Clearly,  the\n\ndistrict court's stay is not a final disposition of the case.\n\nBut  we  agree  with the  Unions  that  it  is an  appealable\n\ninterlocutory injunction.\n\n     The governing statute, 28  U.S.C.   1292(a)(1), provides\n\nfor  immediate  appeals of  interlocutory orders  of district\n\ncourts \"granting . . . [or]  refusing . . . injunctions.\"  An\n\norder staying an arbitration proceedings is in substance, and\n\noften  in form,  a  directive to  the  parties to  cease  the\n\narbitration.  It  is thus  injunctive in character,  A. &amp;  E.\n                                                             \n\nPlastik Pak  Co. v.

However, his  main concern in  Lummus was with\n                                                    \n\n\"the  baneful effect\"  of  permitting appeals  from \"order[s]\n\nrefusing  a stay  of arbitration.\"   297 F.2d  at 86.   As he\n\nexplained,  immediate   appeals   from  such   orders   would\n\ncompromise   the  speedy,   informal  disposition   at  which\n\narbitration  agreements  aim.    Id.    Judge  Friendly  then\n                                   \n\nconcluded  that,  as  a  matter  of  symmetry, \"if  an  order\n\nrefusing a stay\" is deemed not to be  an injunction, then \"an\n\norder granting such  a stay\"  also cannot  be so  classified.\n\nId.  \n   \n\n     Courts since Lummas have  been willing to entertain just\n                        \n\nsuch  a   distinction  between   orders  granting   stays  of\n\narbitration and orders denying them.  Perhaps the best way to\n\nexplain this  outcome is to  say that both  orders constitute\n\ninjunctions   but  that   the  policy   favoring  arbitration\n\nprecludes an  immediate appeal  where the district  court has\n\nrefused a stay.    New England Power Co.,  supra, 456 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n186.  After all,  treating procedure as a special  concern of\n\nthe  courts,  judges  have  not hesitated  to  embroider  the\n\nJudicial Code  with other judge-made rules  on appealability.\n\nE.g., Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104695\"><a href=\"/opinion/104695/cohen-v-beneficial-industrial-loan-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n                                               \n\n(1949).    \n\n     Accordingly we  believe that an order  declining to stay\n\nan arbitration is an injunction but for policy reasons is not\n\n                             -7-\n\nimmediately   reviewable  by   appeal,  although   of  course\n\nfundamental  objections to the  arbitration are preserved for\n\nlater judicial review  if an award is made.   By contrast, an\n\norder  staying   arbitration  is   an   injunction  that   is\n\nimmediately  appealable under  28 U.S.C.     1292(a)(1), even\n\nwhere  section 16  of  the Federal  Arbitration Act  does not\n\napply  to the particular order.  We thus have jurisdiction to\n\nreview the district court's stay order in this case, and turn\n\nnow to  the question whether the district court had authority\n\nto grant such a stay.\n\n                             III.\n\n     The Unions claim  that the stay granted  by the district\n\ncourt was an injunction issued in violation of the  stringent\n\nrequirements  of section  7 of  the Norris-LaGuardia  Act, 29\n\nU.S.C.   107.   In the  alternative, the Union says  that the\n\nstay was unjustified even  under the less stringent equitable\n\nstandards  that govern  ordinary  injunctions.   For  reasons\n\nalready  indicated  we  agree  that  the  stay  comprised  an\n\ninjunction.    The  next,  and more  difficult,  question  is\n\nwhether section 7 supplies the yardstick.\n\n     Section  7 is one of a set of interlocking provisions of\n\nthe Norris-LaGuardia Act designed to curb the use of  federal\n\ncourt injunctions  in cases  \"involving or  growing out  of a\n\n                             -8-\n\nlabor  dispute.\"5   Under  section  7, no  injunction  may be\n\nissued  in such a  case except after  an evidentiary hearing,\n\nspecified  findings by  the  court, and  certain other  steps\n\nincluding  a bond.   The  required findings  include findings\n\nthat absent an injunction \"substantial and irreparable injury\n\nto  complainant's  property  will  follow\"  and  that  public\n\nofficers  \"are  unable  or   unwilling  to  furnish  adequate\n\nprotection.\"  Id.\n                 \n\n     The threshold  question, where section 7  is invoked, is\n\nwhether the case derives  from a \"labor dispute,\"  a critical\n\nphrase that  provides  the outer  boundary  for much  of  the\n\nNorris-LaGuardia Act.  On  the face of the matter,  a dispute\n\nbetween  an employer  and its  unions involving  arbitration,\n\nplant access, discipline of  employees, and the existence vel\n                                                             \n\nnon  of a  collective  bargaining agreement  does comprise  a\n   \n\nlabor dispute,  taking that phrase literally.   The pertinent\n\ndefinitions in  the  statute are  broad, see  section 13,  29\n                                            \n\n                    \n\n     5Section 1 of the statute  says that federal courts have\nno  jurisdiction to  issue  temporary  restraining orders  or\ninjunctions in such cases  except in \"strict conformity\" with\nthe statute; section  4 prohibits  any temporary  restraining\norder or  injunction against certain acts  (e.g., refusing to\n                                                \nwork) regardless  of  circumstances; and  section  7  imposes\nsevere conditions on the grant of injunctive relief  where it\nis not  barred outright by section 4.  29 U.S.C.    101, 104,\n107.\n\n                             -9-\n\nU.S.C.   113, and  have been broadly construed by  the courts\n\nincluding the Supreme Court.6  \n\n     While the Supreme Court has been unwilling to narrow the\n\ndefinition of  \"labor dispute,\"  it  has carved  out a  quite\n\nimportant set  of exceptions  to the Norris-LaGuardia  Act in\n\nrelation to  arbitration.   Following the  Taft-Hartley Act's\n\ncreation  of contract  suits under  section 301,  the Supreme\n\nCourt upheld an injunction requiring an employer to arbitrate\n\na dispute, as  the employer  and union had  agreed.

At least where these objectives coincide, as in\n\nLincoln  Mills and Boys Markets, we are told that the Norris-\n                               \n\nLaGuardia  Act's \"seemingly  absolute terms\"  can be  made to\n\nyield to \"the subsequently enacted provisions of   301(a) . .\n\n. and the purposes of arbitration.\"  Boys Markets, supra, 398\n                                                        \n\nU.S. at 249-50.

Nor can the stay fairly be described as one to\n\nenforce  a  collective bargaining  agreement.   The Company's\n       \n\nposition,  after all, is that  there is no  such agreement at\n\nall.  The Company is seeking not to enforce a contract but to\n\nobtain  a judicial determination that none exists.  This is a\n\n                             -11-\n\npermissible aim but it  is rather far from  the circumstances\n\nof Lincoln Mills and Boys Market.\n                                \n\n     The Company's  argument for  bypassing section 7  is not\n\nwithout some force.

Here  the\n\narbitration clause invoked by  the Unions does not require  a\n\ncourt order:   an  arbitrator being already  designated under\n\nthe alleged  contract--that is,  the prior contract  that the\n\nUnions claim  to have  been extended--the Unions  could begin\n\nthe process without cooperation from the Company or aid  from\n\nthe  courts.  It is the  Company that has taken the offensive\n\nand  sought to  preempt  the arbitration.    Nothing in  AT&amp;T\n                                                             \n\nTechnologies addresses the question whether section 7 applies\n            \n\n                             -12-\n\nto  injunctive  relief  when  an employer  seeks  to  preempt\n\narbitration.\n\n     Taking  a very  broad  view, one  could  argue that  the\n\nLincoln Mills policy of  issuing injunctions to enforce labor\n             \n\ncontracts should entail an  equal willingness to help parties\n\navoid  spurious claims that a contract exists.  It might also\n\nbe argued  that, despite the Norris-LaGuardia  Act's sweeping\n\nlanguage,  the  primary  concerns  that  it  had  with  labor\n\ninjunctions involved conduct such as lawful strikes, peaceful\n\npicketing and union organizing which are very remote from the\n\nconduct--a  disputed  arbitration  proceeding--sought  to  be\n\nstayed in this case.  These are not frivolous arguments.\n\n      On  the  other  hand,   the  judicial  virtues  include\n\nrespecting  statutory language,  and section  7 seems  on its\n\nface  to  apply to  our  case.

Also, what law can  be found in the\n\ncircuits  may lean slightly in favor of the view that section\n\n7 does apply here:  the Ninth Circuit has so held, as did the\n\nThird (though by  a two-to-one vote); and  the Second Circuit\n\ncases  that look  in the opposite  direction do  not directly\n\ndiscuss our issue.7\n\n                    \n\n     7Compare Camping Constr.

That reading, however, goes slightly\n\nbeyond the  precise  words of  the statute.   Further,  there\n\nwould  be some tension  between such a view  of section 7 and\n\nthe Supreme Court's willingness  to uphold injunctions in aid\n\nof contractually  promised  arbitration (Lincoln  Mills)  and\n                                                       \n\neven against peaceful strikes (Boys Markets).  \n                                           \n\n     Having given the term  \"labor disputes\" a broad reading,\n\nwe see good  reason to  preserve at least  the potential  for\n\ninjunctive  relief  where  unlawful  (but  non-violent)  acts\n\nthreaten to  cause  \"substantial and  irreparable injury\"  to\n\nsome  property-like interest (other  than physical security).\n\nThere is even legislative history in the Norris-LaGuardia Act\n\nto  the  effect  that  Congress  did  not  mean  to  preclude\n\ninjunctive  relief against \"unlawful acts or acts of fraud or\n                                                             \n\n                    \n\n     9Section 7  also requires  findings that the  balance of\nharms as to each element of the injunction be in favor of the\ncomplainant and  that complainant lack an  adequate remedy at\nlaw;  but these are  requirements that normally  apply to any\ninjunction.\n\n                             -15-\n\nviolence.\"10    If  the  balance  of  harms  and  irreparable\n\ninjury requirements are taken seriously, little danger exists\n\nof promiscuous injunctions under section 7.\n\n     This  danger   is   further   reduced   by   two   other\n\nconsiderations.  First,  no matter what threats  or harms are\n\npresented, section 4--except as limited by the Supreme court-\n\n-creates  an unqualified  \"no injunction\"  zone for  the core\n\nconduct  of  striking, organizing  in unions,  and picketing.\n\nSecond,  where  the  conduct  falls outside  that  zone,  the\n\nsubstantive  findings required  by  section 7  are backed  by\n\nprocedural  requirements  that go  beyond  those of  ordinary\n\ninjunctions  (e.g., an  evidentiary  hearing and  a bond  for\n                  \n\ncosts and attorney's fees).\n\n     In this case, we  do not think that either  the findings\n\nor the  procedural requirements of section  7 were satisfied.\n\nThe district court may have assimilated a stay of arbitration\n\nto  a stay of  a phase of  its own proceedings,  for which no\n\nfindings of any  kind would  be required.   But despite  some\n\nsimilarities,  the stay  of arbitration  is a  coercive order\n\ndirected not at the  court's own proceedings but at  the out-\n\nof-court activities  of parties before  the court.   That, in\n\nfact,  is why the stay  is an injunction  appealable under 28\n\nU.S.C.   1292(a).\n\n                    \n\n     10S. Rep.

There may be  cases where one or another of  these\n\nprocedural  requirements   is  waived  or   its  omission  is\n\nmanifestly harmless;  but the  lack  of substantive  findings\n\ncannot be so easily ignored.\n\n     Turning  to  substance,  we  do  not  think  that  it is\n\napparent how the lack of an injunction threatened the Company\n\nwith substantial and irreparable injury.  In this  court, the\n\nonly claim made  by the Company under  this head is  that the\n\narbitration  proceedings  would be  used  by  the Unions  \"as\n\ncampaign propaganda  in a  decertification  election.\"   This\n\nassertion is not explained  in the brief, and it  is scarcely\n\n                    \n\n     11Section 7 requires five findings.   The first four are\nthat  unlawful  acts  are threatened,  that  substantial  and\nirreparable injury  will follow, that the balance  of harm on\neach  element  of relief  favors  the  complainant, and  that\ncomplainant  has  no  adequate  remedy at  law.    The  fifth\nfinding,  that public  officers  are unable  or unwilling  to\nfurnish protection,  is (as  we read the  statute) irrelevant\nwhere  the harm is not  of a kind  that the police ordinarily\nprevent.\n\n                             -17-\n\nself-evident that the arbitration proceedings  would or would\n\neven be likely to alter the election results.  \n\n     If the concern is with  relief that the arbitrator might\n\norder,  the short  answer  is that  the  award is  not  self-\n\nexecuting.    A  valid  objection to  jurisdiction  would  be\n\npresented  to and decided by  the court before  the award was\n\nimplemented.   As for any  propaganda benefit accruing to the\n\nUnions from  the  existence of  the arbitration  or even  the\n\narbitrator's  findings,  the  Company  is  no  less  free  to\n\npublicize its own  claim that the  arbitration is a  nullity,\n\npointing to  its declaratory  judgment suit as  evidence that\n\nthe challenge is a serious one.  \n\n     In its district court papers the Company argued that  it\n\nneeded a  stay to forestall  a hopeless predicament:   either\n\nparticipate in the arbitration \"and risk waiving its right to\n\njudicial   determination  of   the   issue   of   substantive\n\narbitrability\" or decline to participate and be  bound by the\n\naward if the arbitrator  is later held to have  jurisdiction.\n\nNot surprisingly,  no authority was cited  for the suggestion\n\nthat  the   Company  would   waive  an   explicitly  asserted\n\njurisdictional  objection by  defending on  the merits.   The\n\nsuggestion is mistaken.   E.g., IAM  Lodge 1777 v.  Garsteel,\n                                                             \n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1008-10 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 111 S.\n                                                     \n\nCt. 143 (1990).  \n\n                             -18-\n\n     It is true  that participating would  cause one form  of\n\nloss, namely, the  time and expense of litigation  before the\n\narbitrator.  But courts have ordinarily not deemed litigation\n\nexpense to be  substantial and irreparable  injury warranting\n\nan  injunction, Renegotiation  Board v.

If the Bannercraft generalization may have some\n                                \n\nexceptions, nothing here makes this case appear exceptional.\n\n     In sum, so far as appears  from this record, there is no\n\nsubstantial and  irreparable injury--or at least  injury of a\n\nkind  that  courts  recognize  in injunction  cases.    Under\n\nordinary standards for injunctive relief,  irreparable injury\n\nis nominally required but courts are often generous where the\n\ncomplainant's  claim   on  the  merits  is   very  strong  or\n\nunanswerable.   Under section  7, however,  there is  no such\n\ngenerosity.   Absent a supported finding  of \"substantial and\n\nirreparable injury,\" the stay of arbitration cannot stand.\n\n                              V.\n\n     This case is not over.  The Company's complaint sought a\n\ndeclaration that there was no collective bargaining agreement\n\nin force after  February 29,  1992, and so  no obligation  to\n\narbitrate disputes arising after that date.  Although section\n\n301 actions are ordinarily  brought to enforce contracts, the\n\n                             -19-\n\nDeclaratory Judgment  Act, 28 U.S.C.     2201-02, permits the\n\ndeclaration of rights about  which a real controversy exists,\n\nand  the  Unions  have  not  disputed  the  district  court's\n\nauthority to grant  declaratory relief.   Nor does section  7\n\npose any barrier to  such a declaration; it is  directed only\n\nagainst injunctions.

See Frankfurter &amp; Greene,  The Labor Injunction\n                                                             \n\n(1930).    Perceived  judicial  abuses gave  rise  to  severe\n\nrestrictions   on   federal   court   authority;    and   the\n\nrestrictions,  being  statutory,   persist  even  though  the\n\nclimate  that led to abuses has altered.  Courts have assumed\n\na  lot of  authority in  recent years,  but the  authority to\n\nrepeal statutes still belongs to Congress.\n\n     The stay of arbitration granted by the district court is\n\nvacated and the  case is remanded for further  proceedings on\n                                 \n\nthe request for declaratory relief.\n\n                             -20-\n</pre>",
