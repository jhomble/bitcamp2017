Michael A. Ponsor,   U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n\n              Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     John M. Thompson with whom Thompson & Thompson, P.C. was on\nbrief for petitioner, appellant.\n     Natalie S. Monroe, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau,\nwith whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General, was on brief for\nrespondent, appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 27, 2010\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.     Alberto Torres was indicted for\n\nmurder in Massachusetts Superior Court in May 1997 for causing the\n\ndeath of his girlfriend's fifteen-month-old child in October 1996\n\nand for charges growing out of the alleged abuse of her two other\n\nchildren.    An autopsy of the deceased child revealed a weeks-old\n\nbroken leg; bruising over most of his body; and significant internal\n\ninjuries, including a tear of the small intestine likely caused by\n\na single blow \"of massive force\" roughly twelve hours before his\n\ndeath.   Torres was tried by a jury, found guilty of murder and\n\nsentenced to life imprisonment in April 1999.\n\n            After his state appeals proved unsuccessful, Torres filed\n\nthis petition for habeas corpus in which he claims, first, that\n\npolice deliberately elicited statements from him in violation of the\n\nSixth Amendment, and, second, that his counsel was ineffective for\n\nnot raising this objection at trial.       To place the objections in\n\ncontext we describe very briefly the evidence at trial and the\n\nevents bearing on the statements that Torres says were improperly\n\nobtained.\n\n            The government's trial evidence consisted primarily of\n\ntestimony from Torres' neighbors, forensic evidence and statements\n\nby Torres himself. Multiple neighbors testified that they had often\n\nseen Torres and his girlfriend, Susan Fappiano, abuse the children,\n\nbut that Fappiano had never done so with the fifteen-month-old, who\n\nwas described as her \"favorite.\"         One neighbor reported seeing\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fTorres throw the baby against a couch, and another testified that on\n\nthe day the baby died, Torres picked him and shook him while yelling\n\n\"shut up.\"    Police responded to a 911 call from Fappiano later that\n\nday and found Torres holding the baby, by then lifeless.\n\n             At    the   scene,   the   police   asked    both   Torres   and   his\n\ngirlfriend for an explanation of bruising on the child.                   Fappiano\n\ntold them that the baby had fallen out of his stroller, and Torres\n\nnodded in agreement; but when Torres was again asked what had\n\nhappened, he stated that he had done nothing wrong and attempted to\n\nwalk away.        Later that night, Torres again denied any wrongdoing,\n\ntelling police that neither he nor Fappiano ever struck their\n\nchildren, aside from Fappiano's occasional \"slap [on] their hands.\"\n\n             This story changed in subsequent meetings with the police.\n\nRoughly a week after the 911 call, Torres met with the police and,\n\nwhen told that Fappiano had blamed him for the child's death, told\n\nthem that Fappiano had \"abused the kids.\"                Two days later, Torres\n\nagain met with the police and now stated that he had seen Fappiano\n\nstrike her children \"quite a few times,\" acknowledging that he had\n\nlied about this in earlier statements.            Throughout these meetings,\n\nTorres continued to deny any wrongdoing and to offer innocuous\n\nexplanations for some of the baby's more serious injuries, saying,\n\nfor example, that the baby had broken his leg by falling off a\n\ncouch.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f          An additional set of statements--those central to the\n\npresent appeal--were given by Torres to the police after he was\n\nindicted in May 1997.   At that time, Torres was in jail on charges\n\nunrelated to this case.     Instead of having the sheriff serve the\n\nindictment on Torres--apparently the normal procedure, Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 277 § 65 (2010)--the prosecutor sent two troopers, Barry\n\nO'Brien and Andrew Bzdel.   O'Brien was the lead investigator in the\n\ncase, and Bzdel had interviewed and taken statements from Torres\n\nduring the initial investigation into the child's death in October\n\n1996.\n\n          The prosecutor instructed the two troopers that Torres was\n\nrepresented by counsel and that they should not question him, but\n\ndid not inform Torres' lawyer of the indictment or that it would be\n\ndelivered directly to Torres.   Torres had been assigned counsel in\n\nconnection with the grand jury proceedings relating to the death of\n\nthe baby and the abuse of the other two children, and it was\n\nanticipated that the same lawyer would be assigned to represent him\n\nonce he was charged with those offenses.\n\n          The two troopers met with Torres in jail; explained to him\n\nthat he had been indicted and that they had a warrant for his arrest\n\non those indictments; and, knowing that Torres could understand\n\nEnglish but could not read it, read the indictments to him out loud.\n\nThe Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (\"SJC\"), described the\n\nremainder of this interaction as follows:\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          After hearing just the first indictment, the\n          defendant interrupted, saying that he had not\n          hit any of the children. The trooper told him\n          to stop, and the trooper resumed the reading of\n          the remaining indictments.       The defendant\n          interrupted again. At that point . . . the\n          trooper   read   the   defendant   his   Miranda\n          warnings.   Beyond the standard warnings, the\n          trooper also told the defendant that he knew\n          the defendant had a lawyer and that he (the\n          defendant) should not say anything about the\n          new charges.    The defendant replied that his\n          lawyer had told him there was nothing to worry\n          about, and that he wanted to speak to the\n          officers.    The trooper asked him whether he\n          really wanted to do so, reminding him of the\n          rights that had been read to him and that he\n          already had a lawyer. The defendant insisted\n          that he wanted to talk. The trooper then read\n          the defendant his Miranda rights a second time,\n          and   the   defendant   acknowledged   that   he\n          understood each of those rights. The defendant\n          then gave a statement, the contents of which\n          were introduced at trial.\n\n\nCommonwealth v. Torres, 813 N.E.2d 1261, 1276-77 (Mass. 2004)\n\n(footnotes omitted).     During this conversation, Torres told the\n\npolice that Fappiano \"must have\" killed the child, but he refused to\n\nreduce his statement to writing, saying his lawyer had advised\n\nagainst it.   Torres eventually told the troopers that he wanted to\n\nspeak with his lawyer, and the conversation ended.\n\n          As Torres was being prepared to return to his cell, he\n\ngestured to Bzdel and asked him to come over.     Torres then said,\n\ncontrary to earlier statements, that he had seen Fappiano kill the\n\nbaby; Bzdel asked what Fappiano had done, but Torres responded that\n\nhe could not tell him.   Later that afternoon, Torres asked to speak\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fwith a correctional officer and told the officer that Fappiano had\n\n\"kicked [the baby] repeatedly\" before his death--a description that\n\nconflicted with forensic evidence.\n\n          Torres was found guilty at trial and sentenced to life\n\nimprisonment, his May 1997 statements being introduced against him\n\nat trial to show evidence of a joint venture with Fappiano and\n\nconsciousness of guilt.   He filed a notice of appeal and thereafter\n\nunsuccessfully moved for a new trial, asserting for the first time\n\nthat his May 1997 statements were taken in violation of his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to counsel because the troopers, knowing that he had\n\nan attorney, visited him at jail in hopes that he would make\n\ninculpatory statements.\n\n          The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the\n\nright to counsel once formal criminal proceedings have begun, see\n\nMoran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 428 (1986); from that point forward,\n\ngovernment agents may not \"deliberately and designedly set out to\n\nelicit information\" from a defendant represented by counsel, Brewer\n\nv. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 399 (1977); see also Massiah v. United\n\nStates, 377 U.S. 201, 205-06 (1964).   However, \"[t]he defendant may\n\nwaive the right whether or not he is already represented by counsel;\n\nthe decision to waive need not itself be counseled.\"     Montejo v.\n\nLouisiana, 129 S. Ct. 2079, 2085 (2009);      see also Michigan v.\n\nHarvey, 494 U.S. 344, 352 (1990).\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f            The SJC affirmed both Torres' conviction and the denial of\n\nhis motion for a new trial, holding among other things that the\n\nrecord failed to show that the troopers had deliberately attempted\n\nto elicit statements from him in violation of the Sixth Amendment.\n\nTorres, 813 N.E.2d at 1278.        On October 19, 2005,        Torres filed a\n\npetition for habeas corpus in federal district court in which he\n\nasserted the Sixth Amendment and inadequate assistance claims, along\n\nwith an attack on the evidence and a Confrontation Clause claim.\n\n            The district court entered summary judgment against Torres\n\non his deliberate elicitation and ineffective assistance claims,\n\nconcluding that while various interpretations of the record might be\n\npossible,     the   SJC's   findings     were    adequately    supported     and\n\nreasonable.    Torres v. Dennehy, No. 05-30226, slip op. at 14-15, 22\n\n(D. Mass. Jan. 4, 2008).       The district court denied reconsideration\n\nbut certified appealability as to all claims except the attack on\n\nthe evidence and entered final judgment denying the habeas petition.\n\nOn this appeal, Torres presses only the deliberate elicitation and\n\nineffective assistance claims.\n\n            We review the district court de novo, Forsyth v. Spencer,\n\n595 F.3d 81, 84 (1st Cir. 2010); but the governing habeas statute,\n\nas amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n\n1996 (\"AEDPA\"), provides that state courts' factual findings are\n\npresumed    correct   absent   clear    and     convincing   evidence   to   the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f contrary,    28   U.S.C.    §   2254(e)(1)   (2006),1       and   that    their\n\n dispositions of federal law are to be set aside only when \"contrary\n\n to, or . . . an unreasonable application of, clearly established\n\n Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\" id. § 2254(d)(1).\n\n             A state court decision is \"contrary to\" federal law if it\n\n \"arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme]\n\n Court on a question of law or . . . decides a case differently than\n\n [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable\n\n facts,\" and it is an \"unreasonable application\" of federal law if it\n\n \"identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme]\n\n Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle                to the\n\n facts of the [defendant's] case.\"          Thaler v. Haynes, 130 S. Ct.\n\n 1171, 1174 (2010) (per curiam) (quoting          Williams v. Taylor, 529\n\n U.S. 362, 413 (2000)).\n\n             Torres first takes issue with the SJC's conclusion--\n\n factual, he says--that the troopers did not \"deliberately elicit\"\n\n information from him when visiting him in jail on May 31, 1997.\n\n Torres'   claim--which     at   times   bleeds   into   a   legal   argument,\n\n addressed later--is that the troopers' visit to read the indictment,\n\n\n\n     1\n      Section 2254(e)(1) states that \"determinations of a factual\nissue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct,\" and\nthat \"[t]he applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the\npresumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence\"; section\n2254(d)(2) of the AEDPA states that a petition alleging factual error\nwill be granted only if the state court proceeding \"resulted in a\ndecision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts\nin light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\"\n\n                                     -8-\n\frather than having the sheriff do so, shows that the government\n\nintended to elicit testimony from him. The district court concluded\n\nthat this argument \"boils down to an ardent presentation of one\n\nversion of what might conceivably have happened on May 31, 1997.\"\n\nTorres, No. 05-30226, slip op. at 14.\n\n            While Torres presents an arguable interpretation of the\n\nfacts, the SJC found otherwise and provided adequate support for its\n\nposition.    In particular, the SJC stated that\n\n            [w]hatever suspicions the defendant might have\n            on that subject, the motion judge's findings\n            with respect to what the troopers actually said\n            to the defendant once they got to the jail\n            would belie the defendant's theory--if their\n            intention and hope had been that reading the\n            indictments out loud would prompt the defendant\n            to start making a statement, they would not\n            have cut off his attempt to do so during the\n            reading of the indictments, nor would they have\n            advised him against speaking to them when he\n            did so a second time, nor would they have\n            suggested that he speak instead with his\n            lawyer.\n\nTorres, 813 N.E.2d at 1278.    Torres' counter-arguments do not show\n\nthat the state courts' determination of the facts was unreasonable.\n\nSee Wood v. Allen, 130 S. Ct. 841, 849 (2010) (quoting Taylor, 529\n\nU.S. at 410-11).\n\n            Torres makes two collateral arguments, the first of which\n\nis that the SJC should not have relied on the motion judge's\n\nfindings of fact because they were made in the context of a Fifth\n\nrather than Sixth Amendment claim.     But this context did not alter\n\nthe historical facts found by the motion judge as to the progression\n\n                                 -9-\n\fof the conversation and conclusions that Torres spoke \"spontaneously\n\nand over the objection of Sergeant O'Brien,\" and the SJC was\n\nentitled to rely upon those findings in reaching its own conclusion.\n\n See Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U.S. 422, 435 (1983); Teti v.\n\nBender, 507 F.3d 50, 59 (1st Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1287\n\n(2008).\n\n          Torres' second, related argument is that the district\n\ncourt should have made supplemental findings of fact because, he\n\nsays, the SJC's findings \"focus[ed] almost exclusively on what\n\ntranspired after the officers already initiated a conversation with\n\nMr. Torres\" when (Torres asserts) other evidence makes clear that\n\nthe troopers knowingly exploited their opportunity to read the\n\nindictments   to   Torres.   Torres    insists   that   \"uncontradicted\n\ntestimony\" supports his argument, but he does not point to any\n\nparticular statements about events prior to that conversation.\n\n          Probably the strongest version of this argument would be\n\nto say that the prosecutor's choice of the troopers rather than the\n\nsheriff to read the indictment must have been intended to elicit\n\nstatements.   But there is no direct proof of this and, as noted, the\n\ntroopers' repeated warnings to Torres were at odds with any supposed\n\neffort to elicit statements.      So there is no need to consider\n\nwhether, even if the prosecutor hoped to elicit statements, the\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f causation chain was broken by the troopers' self-restraint in the\n\n interview.2\n\n           Torres' next set of arguments assert something closer to\n\n legal error, namely, that the SJC decision conflicts with Supreme\n\n Court decisions on elicitation under the Massiah and Brewer line of\n\n cases and so is contrary to, and an unreasonable application of,\n\n clearly established federal law.   In particular, he argues that the\n\n troopers' action should be condemned under an objective standard\n\n even if they lacked a subjective intent to elicit statements.   The\n\n government says that the objective-test argument was not made below\n\n but that the troopers' conduct passes that test as well.\n\n           Brewer neither supports an objective standard nor has any\n\n resemblance to our case.    There the Supreme Court found that the\n\n officer \"deliberately and designedly set out to elicit information\"\n\n from the defendant, 430 U.S. at 399, urging him to \"[j]ust think\n\n about\" the fact that a girl he had been indicted for murdering would\n\n never receive a proper burial given that winter was approaching.\n\n Id. at 393.   The Court went on to quote the officer's testimony at\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The circumstances are less suspicious than they might appear.\nThere is some indication in the record that the prosecutor was\nconcerned that Torres might be released before he was formally\ndetained under the new indictment, which entailed prompt delivery of\nthe indictment most easily accomplished by direction to the troopers;\nand, as for reading rather than mere delivery of the indictment,\nTorres apparently could not read English even though he understood\nit.\n\n                                 -11-\n\ftrial that he had hoped to get the very admission he secured.           Id.\n\nat 399.\n\n            Torres also relies on Fellers v. United States, 540 U.S.\n\n519 (2004). There, officers--who arrived to arrest Fellers after he\n\nhad been indicted on drug charges--said that they wanted to discuss\n\nwith him his involvement in drug dealing and association with\n\ncertain    co-conspirators;    and   the    defendant   made   incriminating\n\nstatements in response.       The Supreme Court held that \"there is no\n\nquestion that the officers . . . 'deliberately elicited' information\n\n. . . . Indeed, the officers . . . informed him that their purpose\n\nin coming was to discuss his involvement in the [crimes].\"           Id. at\n\n524.\n\n            The equating of deliberate elicitation with \"purpose\" in\n\nFellers pretty clearly suggests a concern with subjective intent of\n\nthe officers; and the case is certainly distinguishable on its\n\nfacts.    The troopers did not ask Torres for information and in fact\n\ntold Torres not to interrupt the reading of the indictment and\n\nreminded him that he had a lawyer.          It was Torres who nevertheless\n\ninsisted that he wanted to talk.      Thus the SJC's decision is neither\n\n\"contrary to\" nor an \"unreasonable application\" of Fellers or\n\nBrewer.    Taylor, 529 U.S. at 412-13.\n\n            Finally, one phrase in United States v. Henry, 447 U.S.\n\n264, 274 (1980), could be read to invoke an objective standard, the\n\nCourt saying tersely that police may cause a violation of Sixth\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fAmendment rights by \"intentionally creating a situation likely to\n\ninduce [a defendant] to make incriminating statements without the\n\nassistance of counsel.\"    Although one circuit court has endorsed an\n\nobjective standard, Beaty v. Stewart, 303 F.3d 975, 991 (9th Cir.\n\n2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 1053 (2003), this single sentence in\n\nHenry is far from clear: it could be taken to mean that the police,\n\nhaving deliberately created a situation, could be inferred to have\n\nintended the obvious consequences.\n\n            In fact, Henry, like Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159\n\n(1985),   involved   the   deliberate    use   of   informants    to   elicit\n\ninformation from a defendant represented by counsel.             474 U.S. at\n\n161, 176-77; 447 U.S. at 270-71.    Thus, like the other Supreme Court\n\ncases, Henry and Moulton involved deliberate elicitation.           At best,\n\nthe Supreme Court's standard \"remains somewhat unclear,\"           LaFave et\n\nal., Criminal Procedure § 6.4(g), at 691 (3d ed. 2007), so the SJC's\n\nreading is neither in direct conflict with nor an unreasonable\n\napplication of Supreme Court precedent.\n\n            Even if an objective standard governed, we could hardly\n\nconclude that reading an indictment to a defendant is (in Henry's\n\nterms) \"likely to induce,\" 447 U.S. at 274, a defendant to make\n\nincriminating statements, any more than making an arrest is likely\n\nto do so.    This is especially so where, as here, the \"situation,\"\n\nid., includes statements by the officers telling the defendant not\n\nto interrupt their reading of the indictment and warnings that he\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fwas represented by counsel and should not say anything about the new\n\ncharges in the indictment.\n\n          Because the elicitation issue was resolved on the merits\n\nagainst Torres, it does not matter whether counsel ought to have\n\nraised it earlier, and his ineffective assistance of counsel claim\n\nfails.

Thompson with whom Thompson &amp; Thompson, P.C. was on brief for petitioner, appellant.</p>\n<p>Natalie S. Monroe, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau, with whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General, was on brief for respondent, appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and BOUDIN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Alberto Torres was indicted for murder in Massachusetts Superior Court in May 1997 for causing the death of his girlfriend's fifteen-month-old child in October 1996 and for charges growing out of the alleged abuse of her two other children. An autopsy of the deceased child revealed a weeks-old broken leg; bruising over most of his body; and significant internal injuries, including a tear of the small intestine likely caused by a single blow \"of massive force\" roughly twelve hours before his death. Torres was tried by a jury, found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in April 1999.</p>\n<p>After his state appeals proved unsuccessful, Torres filed this petition for habeas corpus in which he claims, first, that police deliberately elicited statements from him in violation of the Sixth Amendment, and, second, that his counsel was ineffective for not raising this objection at trial. To place the objections in context we describe very briefly the evidence at trial and the events bearing on the statements that Torres says were improperly obtained.</p>\n<p>The government's trial evidence consisted primarily of testimony from Torres' neighbors, forensic evidence and statements by Torres himself. Multiple neighbors testified that they had often seen Torres and his girlfriend, Susan Fappiano, abuse the children, but that Fappiano had never done so with the fifteen-month-old, who was described as her \"favorite.\" One neighbor reported seeing Torres throw the baby against a couch, and another testified that on the day the baby died, Torres picked him and shook him while yelling \"shut up.\" Police responded to a 911 call from Fappiano later that day and found Torres holding the baby, by then lifeless.</p>\n<p>At the scene, the police asked both Torres and his girlfriend for an explanation of bruising on the child. Fappiano told them that the baby had fallen out of his stroller, and Torres nodded in agreement; but when Torres was again asked what had happened, he stated that he had done nothing wrong and attempted to walk away. Later that night, Torres again denied any wrongdoing, telling police that neither he nor Fappiano ever struck their children, aside from Fappiano's occasional \"slap [on] their hands.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> This story changed in subsequent meetings with the police. Roughly a week after the 911 call, Torres met with the police and, when told that Fappiano had blamed him for the child's death, told them that Fappiano had \"abused the kids.\" Two days later, Torres again met with the police and now stated that he had seen Fappiano strike her children \"quite a few times,\" acknowledging that he had lied about this in earlier statements. Throughout these meetings, Torres continued to deny any wrongdoing and to offer innocuous explanations for some of the baby's more serious injuries, saying, for example, that the baby had broken his leg by falling off a couch.</p>\n<p>An additional set of statementsthose central to the present appealwere given by Torres to the police after he was indicted in May 1997. At that time, Torres was in jail on charges unrelated to this case. Instead of having the sheriff serve the indictment on Torresapparently the normal procedure, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 277 § 65 (2010)the prosecutor sent two troopers, Barry O'Brien and Andrew Bzdel. O'Brien was the lead investigator in the case, and Bzdel had interviewed and taken statements from Torres during the initial investigation into the child's death in October 1996.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor instructed the two troopers that Torres was represented by counsel and that they should not question him, but did not inform Torres' lawyer of the indictment or that it would be delivered directly to Torres. Torres had been assigned counsel in connection with the grand jury proceedings relating to the death of the baby and the abuse of the other two children, and it was anticipated that the same lawyer would be assigned to represent him once he was charged with those offenses.</p>\n<p>The two troopers met with Torres in jail; explained to him that he had been indicted and that they had a warrant for his arrest on those indictments; and, knowing that Torres could understand English but could not read it, read the indictments to him out loud. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (\"SJC\"), described the remainder of this interaction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>After hearing just the first indictment, the defendant interrupted, saying that he had not hit any of the children. The trooper told him to stop, and the trooper resumed the reading of the remaining indictments. The defendant interrupted again. At that point ... the trooper read the defendant his <i>Miranda</i> warnings. Beyond the standard warnings, the trooper also told the defendant that he knew the defendant had a lawyer and that he (the defendant) should not say anything about the new charges. The defendant replied that his lawyer had told him there was nothing to worry about, and that he wanted to speak to the officers. The trooper asked him whether he really wanted to do so, reminding him of the rights that had been read to him and that he already had a lawyer. The defendant insisted that he wanted to talk. The trooper then read the defendant his <i>Miranda</i> rights a second time, and the defendant acknowledged that he understood each of those rights. The defendant then gave a statement, the contents of which were introduced at trial.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Commonwealth v. Torres,</i> 442 Mass. 554, 813 N.E.2d 1261, 1276-77 (2004) (footnotes omitted). During this conversation, Torres told the police that Fappiano \"must have\" killed the child, but he refused to reduce his statement to writing, saying his lawyer had advised against it. Torres eventually told the troopers that he wanted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> to speak with his lawyer, and the conversation ended.</p>\n<p>As Torres was being prepared to return to his cell, he gestured to Bzdel and asked him to come over. Torres then said, contrary to earlier statements, that he had seen Fappiano kill the baby; Bzdel asked what Fappiano had done, but Torres responded that he could not tell him. Later that afternoon, Torres asked to speak with a correctional officer and told the officer that Fappiano had \"kicked [the baby] repeatedly\" before his deatha description that conflicted with forensic evidence.</p>\n<p>Torres was found guilty at trial and sentenced to life imprisonment, his May 1997 statements being introduced against him at trial to show evidence of a joint venture with Fappiano and consciousness of guilt. He filed a notice of appeal and thereafter unsuccessfully moved for a new trial, asserting for the first time that his May 1997 statements were taken in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel because the troopers, knowing that he had an attorney, visited him at jail in hopes that he would make inculpatory statements.</p>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to counsel once formal criminal proceedings have begun, <i>see </i><i>Moran v. Burbine,</i> 475 U.S. 412, 428, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986); from that point forward, government agents may not \"deliberately and designedly set out to elicit information\" from a defendant represented by counsel, <i>Brewer v. Williams,</i> 430 U.S. 387, 399, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977); <i>see also </i><i>Massiah v. United States,</i> 377 U.S. 201, 205-06, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964). However, \"[t]he defendant may waive the right whether or not he is already represented by counsel; the decision to waive need not itself be counseled.\" <i>Montejo v. Louisiana,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2079, 2085, 173 L.Ed.2d 955 (2009); <i>see also </i><i>Michigan v. Harvey,</i> 494 U.S. 344, 352, 110 S.Ct. 1176, 108 L.Ed.2d 293 (1990).</p>\n<p>The SJC affirmed both Torres' conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial, holding among other things that the record failed to show that the troopers had deliberately attempted to elicit statements from him in violation of the Sixth Amendment. <i>Torres,</i> 813 N.E.2d at 1278. On October 19, 2005, Torres filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court in which he asserted the Sixth Amendment and inadequate assistance claims, along with an attack on the evidence and a Confrontation Clause claim.</p>\n<p>The district court entered summary judgment against Torres on his deliberate elicitation and ineffective assistance claims, concluding that while various interpretations of the record might be possible, the SJC's findings were adequately supported and reasonable. <i>Torres v. Dennehy,</i> No. 05-30226, slip op. at 14-15, 22 (D.Mass. Jan.4, 2008). The district court denied reconsideration but certified appealability as to all claims except the attack on the evidence and entered final judgment denying the habeas petition. On this appeal, Torres presses only the deliberate elicitation and ineffective assistance claims.</p>\n<p>We review the district court <i>de novo, </i><i>Forsyth v. Spencer,</i> 595 F.3d 81, 84 (1st Cir.2010); but the governing habeas statute, as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), provides that state courts' factual findings are presumed correct absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1) (2006),<sup>[1]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> and that their dispositions of federal law are to be set aside only when \"contrary to, or ... an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\" <i>id.</i> § 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p>A state court decision is \"contrary to\" federal law if it \"arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or ... decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts,\" and it is an \"unreasonable application\" of federal law if it \"identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the [defendant's] case.\" <i>Thaler v. Haynes,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1171, 1174, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010) (per curiam) (quoting <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)).</p>\n<p>Torres first takes issue with the SJC's conclusionfactual, he saysthat the troopers did not \"deliberately elicit\" information from him when visiting him in jail on May 31, 1997. Torres' claim which at times bleeds into a legal argument, addressed lateris that the troopers' visit to read the indictment, rather than having the sheriff do so, shows that the government intended to elicit testimony from him. The district court concluded that this argument \"boils down to an ardent presentation of one version of what might conceivably have happened on May 31, 1997.\" <i>Torres,</i> No. 05-30226, slip op. at 14.</p>\n<p>While Torres presents an arguable interpretation of the facts, the SJC found otherwise and provided adequate support for its position. In particular, the SJC stated that</p>\n<blockquote>[w]hatever suspicions the defendant might have on that subject, the motion judge's findings with respect to what the troopers actually said to the defendant once they got to the jail would belie the defendant's theoryif their intention and hope had been that reading the indictments out loud would prompt the defendant to start making a statement, they would not have cut off his attempt to do so during the reading of the indictments, nor would they have advised him against speaking to them when he did so a second time, nor would they have suggested that he speak instead with his lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Torres,</i> 813 N.E.2d at 1278. Torres' counter-arguments do not show that the state courts' determination of the facts was unreasonable. <i>See </i><i>Wood v. Allen,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 841, 849, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010) (quoting <i>Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. at 410-11, 120 S.Ct. 1495).</p>\n<p>Torres makes two collateral arguments, the first of which is that the SJC should not have relied on the motion judge's findings of fact because they were made in the context of a Fifth rather than Sixth Amendment claim. But this context did not alter the historical facts found by the motion judge as to the progression of the conversation and conclusions that Torres spoke \"spontaneously and over the objection of Sergeant O'Brien,\" and the SJC was entitled to rely upon those findings in reaching its own conclusion. <i>See </i><i>Marshall v. Lonberger,</i> 459 U.S. 422, 435, 103 S.Ct. 843, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983); <i>Teti v. Bender,</i> 507 F.3d 50, 59 (1st Cir.2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> 552 U.S. 1287, 128 S.Ct. 1719, 170 L.Ed.2d 525 (2008).</p>\n<p>Torres' second, related argument is that the district court should have made supplemental findings of fact because, he says, the SJC's findings \"focus[ed] almost exclusively on what transpired after the officers already initiated a conversation with Mr. Torres\" when (Torres asserts) other evidence makes clear that the troopers knowingly exploited their opportunity to read the indictments to Torres. Torres insists that \"uncontradicted testimony\" supports his argument, but he does not point to any particular statements about events prior to that conversation.</p>\n<p>Probably the strongest version of this argument would be to say that the prosecutor's choice of the troopers rather than the sheriff to read the indictment must have been intended to elicit statements. But there is no direct proof of this and, as noted, the troopers' repeated warnings to Torres were at odds with any supposed effort to elicit statements. So there is no need to consider whether, even if the prosecutor hoped to elicit statements, the causation chain was broken by the troopers' self-restraint in the interview.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Torres' next set of arguments assert something closer to legal error, namely, that the SJC decision conflicts with Supreme Court decisions on elicitation under the <i>Massiah</i> and <i>Brewer</i> line of cases and so is contrary to, and an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. In particular, he argues that the troopers' action should be condemned under an objective standard even if they lacked a subjective intent to elicit statements. The government says that the objective-test argument was not made below but that the troopers' conduct passes that test as well.</p>\n<p><i>Brewer</i> neither supports an objective standard nor has any resemblance to our case. There the Supreme Court found that the officer \"deliberately and designedly set out to elicit information\" from the defendant, 430 U.S. at 399, 97 S.Ct. 1232, urging him to \"[j]ust think about\" the fact that a girl he had been indicted for murdering would never receive a proper burial given that winter was approaching. <i>Id.</i> at 393, 97 S.Ct. 1232. The Court went on to quote the officer's testimony at trial that he had hoped to get the very admission he secured. <i>Id.</i> at 399, 97 S.Ct. 1232.</p>\n<p>Torres also relies on <i>Fellers v. United States,</i> 540 U.S. 519, 124 S.Ct. 1019, 157 L.Ed.2d 1016 (2004). There, officerswho arrived to arrest Fellers after he had been indicted on drug chargessaid that they wanted to discuss with him his involvement in drug dealing and association with certain co-conspirators; and the defendant made incriminating statements in response. The Supreme Court held that \"there is no question that the officers ... `deliberately elicited' information.... Indeed, the officers ... informed him that their purpose in coming was to discuss his involvement in the [crimes].\" <i>Id.</i> at 524, 124 S.Ct. 1019.</p>\n<p>The equating of deliberate elicitation with \"purpose\" in <i>Fellers</i> pretty clearly suggests a concern with subjective intent of the officers; and the case is certainly distinguishable on its facts. The troopers did not ask Torres for information and in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> fact told Torres not to interrupt the reading of the indictment and reminded him that he had a lawyer. It was Torres who nevertheless insisted that he wanted to talk. Thus the SJC's decision is neither \"contrary to\" nor an \"unreasonable application\" of <i>Fellers</i> or <i>Brewer. </i><i>Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. at 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p>Finally, one phrase in <i>United States v. Henry,</i> 447 U.S. 264, 274, 100 S.Ct. 2183, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980), could be read to invoke an objective standard, the Court saying tersely that police may cause a violation of Sixth Amendment rights by \"intentionally creating a situation likely to induce [a defendant] to make incriminating statements without the assistance of counsel.\" Although one circuit court has endorsed an objective standard, <i>Beaty v. Stewart,</i> 303 F.3d 975, 991 (9th Cir.2002), <i>cert. denied,</i> 538 U.S. 1053, 123 S.Ct. 2073, 155 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2003), this single sentence in <i>Henry</i> is far from clear: it could be taken to mean that the police, having deliberately created a situation, could be inferred to have intended the obvious consequences.</p>\n<p>In fact, <i>Henry,</i> like <i>Maine v. Moulton,</i> 474 U.S. 159, 106 S.Ct. 477, 88 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985), involved the deliberate use of informants to elicit information from a defendant represented by counsel. 474 U.S. at 161, 176-77, 106 S.Ct. 477, 447 U.S. at 270-71, 100 S.Ct. 2183. Thus, like the other Supreme Court cases, <i>Henry</i> and <i>Moulton</i> involved deliberate elicitation. At best, the Supreme Court's standard \"remains somewhat unclear,\" LaFave et al., <i>Criminal Procedure</i> § 6.4(g), at 691 (3d ed.2007), so the SJC's reading is neither in direct conflict with nor an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p>Even if an objective standard governed, we could hardly conclude that reading an indictment to a defendant is (in <i>Henry's</i> terms) \"likely to induce,\" 447 U.S. at 274, 100 S.Ct. 2183, a defendant to make incriminating statements, any more than making an arrest is likely to do so. This is especially so where, as here, the \"situation,\" <i>id.,</i> includes statements by the officers telling the defendant not to interrupt their reading of the indictment and warnings that he was represented by counsel and should not say anything about the new charges in the indictment.</p>\n<p>Because the elicitation issue was resolved on the merits against Torres, it does not matter whether counsel ought to have raised it earlier, and his ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails. Similarly, we need not reach Torres' argument that his <i>Miranda</i> waivergiven during the interview with the trooperswas invalid since it depends on the assumption that interview was itself a Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p>The district court's judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Section 2254(e)(1) states that \"determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct,\" and that \"[t]he applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence\"; section 2254(d)(2) of the AEDPA states that a petition alleging factual error will be granted only if the state court proceeding \"resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The circumstances are less suspicious than they might appear. There is some indication in the record that the prosecutor was concerned that Torres might be released before he was formally detained under the new indictment, which entailed prompt delivery of the indictment most easily accomplished by direction to the troopers; and, as for reading rather than mere delivery of the indictment, Torres apparently could not read English even though he understood it.</p>\n\n</div>",

Torres' claim which at times bleeds into a legal argument, addressed lateris that the troopers' visit to read the indictment, rather than having the sheriff do so, shows that the government intended to elicit testimony from him. The district court concluded that this argument \"boils down to an ardent presentation of one version of what might conceivably have happened on May 31, 1997.\" <i>Torres,</i> No. 05-30226, slip op. at 14.</p>\n<p>While Torres presents an arguable interpretation of the facts, the SJC found otherwise and provided adequate support for its position. In particular, the SJC stated that</p>\n<blockquote>[w]hatever suspicions the defendant might have on that subject, the motion judge's findings with respect to what the troopers actually said to the defendant once they got to the jail would belie the defendant's theoryif their intention and hope had been that reading the indictments out loud would prompt the defendant to start making a statement, they would not have cut off his attempt to do so during the reading of the indictments, nor would they have advised him against speaking to them when he did so a second time, nor would they have suggested that he speak instead with his lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Torres,</i> 813 N.E.2d at 1278. Torres' counter-arguments do not show that the state courts' determination of the facts was unreasonable. <i>See </i><i>Wood v.

But this context did not alter the historical facts found by the motion judge as to the progression of the conversation and conclusions that Torres spoke \"spontaneously and over the objection of Sergeant O'Brien,\" and the SJC was entitled to rely upon those findings in reaching its own conclusion. <i>See </i><i>Marshall v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></span> (2008).</p>\n<p>Torres' second, related argument is that the district court should have made supplemental findings of fact because, he says, the SJC's findings \"focus[ed] almost exclusively on what transpired after the officers already initiated a conversation with Mr. Torres\" when (Torres asserts) other evidence makes clear that the troopers knowingly exploited their opportunity to read the indictments to Torres. Torres insists that \"uncontradicted testimony\" supports his argument, but he does not point to any particular statements about events prior to that conversation.</p>\n<p>Probably the strongest version of this argument would be to say that the prosecutor's choice of the troopers rather than the sheriff to read the indictment must have been intended to elicit statements. But there is no direct proof of this and, as noted, the troopers' repeated warnings to Torres were at odds with any supposed effort to elicit statements. So there is no need to consider whether, even if the prosecutor hoped to elicit statements, the causation chain was broken by the troopers' self-restraint in the interview.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Torres' next set of arguments assert something closer to legal error, namely, that the SJC decision conflicts with Supreme Court decisions on elicitation under the <i>Massiah</i> and <i>Brewer</i> line of cases and so is contrary to, and an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. In particular, he argues that the troopers' action should be condemned under an objective standard even if they lacked a subjective intent to elicit statements. The government says that the objective-test argument was not made below but that the troopers' conduct passes that test as well.</p>\n<p><i>Brewer</i> neither supports an objective standard nor has any resemblance to our case. There the Supreme Court found that the officer \"deliberately and designedly set out to elicit information\" from the defendant, 430 U.S. at 399, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109624\"><a href=\"/opinion/109624/brewer-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1232</span></a></span>, urging him to \"[j]ust think about\" the fact that a girl he had been indicted for murdering would never receive a proper burial given that winter was approaching. <i>Id.</i> at 393, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109624\"><a href=\"/opinion/109624/brewer-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1232</span></a></span>. The Court went on to quote the officer's testimony at trial that he had hoped to get the very admission he secured. <i>Id.</i> at 399, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109624\"><a href=\"/opinion/109624/brewer-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1232</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Torres also relies on <i>Fellers v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131158\"><a href=\"/opinion/131158/fellers-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131158\"><a href=\"/opinion/131158/fellers-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131158\"><a href=\"/opinion/131158/fellers-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1016</span></a></span> (2004). There, officerswho arrived to arrest Fellers after he had been indicted on drug chargessaid that they wanted to discuss with him his involvement in drug dealing and association with certain co-conspirators; and the defendant made incriminating statements in response. The Supreme Court held that \"there is no question that the officers ... `deliberately elicited' information.... Indeed, the officers ... informed him that their purpose in coming was to discuss his involvement in the [crimes].\" <i>Id.</i> at 524, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131158\"><a href=\"/opinion/131158/fellers-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The equating of deliberate elicitation with \"purpose\" in <i>Fellers</i> pretty clearly suggests a concern with subjective intent of the officers; and the case is certainly distinguishable on its facts. The troopers did not ask Torres for information and in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> fact told Torres not to interrupt the reading of the indictment and reminded him that he had a lawyer. It was Torres who nevertheless insisted that he wanted to talk. Thus the SJC's decision is neither \"contrary to\" nor an \"unreasonable application\" of <i>Fellers</i> or <i>Brewer. </i><i>Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. at 412-13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Henry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110300\"><a href=\"/opinion/110300/united-states-v-henry/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span>, 274, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110300\"><a href=\"/opinion/110300/united-states-v-henry/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span> (1980), could be read to invoke an objective standard, the Court saying tersely that police may cause a violation of Sixth Amendment rights by \"intentionally creating a situation likely to induce [a defendant] to make incriminating statements without the assistance of counsel.\" Although one circuit court has endorsed an objective standard, <i>Beaty v. Stewart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779150\"><a href=\"/opinion/779150/donald-edward-beaty-v-terry-stewart-director/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span>, 991 (9th Cir.2002), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1098</span></span> (2003), this single sentence in <i>Henry</i> is far from clear: it could be taken to mean that the police, having deliberately created a situation, could be inferred to have intended the obvious consequences.</p>\n<p>In fact, <i>Henry,</i> like <i>Maine v. Moulton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111546\"><a href=\"/opinion/111546/maine-v-moulton/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111546\"><a href=\"/opinion/111546/maine-v-moulton/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span> (1985), involved the deliberate use of informants to elicit information from a defendant represented by counsel. 474 U.S. at 161, 176-77, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111546\"><a href=\"/opinion/111546/maine-v-moulton/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span>, 447 U.S. at 270-71, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110300\"><a href=\"/opinion/110300/united-states-v-henry/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2183</span></a></span>. Thus, like the other Supreme Court cases, <i>Henry</i> and <i>Moulton</i> involved deliberate elicitation. At best, the Supreme Court's standard \"remains somewhat unclear,\" LaFave et al., <i>Criminal Procedure</i> § 6.4(g), at 691 (3d ed.2007), so the SJC's reading is neither in direct conflict with nor an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p>Even if an objective standard governed, we could hardly conclude that reading an indictment to a defendant is (in <i>Henry's</i> terms) \"likely to induce,\" 447 U.S. at 274, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110300\"><a href=\"/opinion/110300/united-states-v-henry/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2183</span></a></span>, a defendant to make incriminating statements, any more than making an arrest is likely to do so. This is especially so where, as here, the \"situation,\" <i>id.,</i> includes statements by the officers telling the defendant not to interrupt their reading of the indictment and warnings that he was represented by counsel and should not say anything about the new charges in the indictment.</p>\n<p>Because the elicitation issue was resolved on the merits against Torres, it does not matter whether counsel ought to have raised it earlier, and his ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails. Similarly, we need not reach Torres' argument that his <i>Miranda</i> waivergiven during the interview with the trooperswas invalid since it depends on the assumption that interview was itself a Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p>The district court's judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Section 2254(e)(1) states that \"determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct,\" and that \"[t]he applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence\"; section 2254(d)(2) of the AEDPA states that a petition alleging factual error will be granted only if the state court proceeding \"resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The circumstances are less suspicious than they might appear. There is some indication in the record that the prosecutor was concerned that Torres might be released before he was formally detained under the new indictment, which entailed prompt delivery of the indictment most easily accomplished by direction to the troopers; and, as for reading rather than mere delivery of the indictment, Torres apparently could not read English even though he understood it.</p>\n\n</div>",
