Graves, Jr., with whom Graves & Doyle was on brief,\nfor the petitioner.\n     Katharine E. Clark, Trial Attorney, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, with whom Tony West, Assistant Attorney General, Civil\nDivision, and Shelley R. Goad, Assistant Director, were on brief,\nfor respondent.\n\n\n\n                           December 29, 2010\n\f            Per   Curiam.    On   February   5,    2010,   the   Bureau   of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) rejected the claim of Paul McGruer, a\n\ncitizen of the United Kingdom who has been a lawful permanent\n\nresident of the United States, that he had not committed an\n\naggravated felony.      The BIA held that McGruer was removable and\n\nthat he was not eligible to apply for cancellation of removal.\n\n            The BIA found that the Immigration Judge (IJ), in her\n\nSeptember 10, 2008 decision, had correctly ordered McGruer removed,\n\nand had correctly determined that McGruer was ineligible for\n\ncancellation of removal because McGruer had been convicted of a\n\ndrug trafficking crime and thus of an aggravated felony under 8\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(B) and 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).           The BIA upheld\n\nthe IJ's conclusions that McGruer's 2003 conviction of cultivating\n\nmore than five but fewer than one-hundred marijuana plants under\n\nMaine law, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 1117(1)(B)(3), was\n\n\"cultivation,\" and thus \"manufacturing,\" of marijuana under 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1), and therefore a removable offense under the\n\nfederal Controlled Substances Act.       The state statute under which\n\nMcGruer was convicted is entitled \"Cultivating Marijuana\" and\n\nprovides:     \"A person is guilty of cultivating marijuana if . . .\n\n[t]he   person    intentionally   or   knowingly   grows   or    cultivates\n\nmarijuana.\"      Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 1117.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f          Before the IJ and BIA, McGruer argued that his Maine\n\nmarijuana cultivation offense1 is not a drug trafficking crime\n\nbecause the Maine statute of conviction has no element requiring\n\nproof that the marijuana cultivation be for a commercial purpose,\n\nas opposed to being for personal use.2           Both the IJ and the BIA\n\nrejected this argument.    We deny the petition for review.\n\n                                       I.\n\n          While this court has jurisdiction to review final orders\n\nof removal, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, our jurisdiction in cases involving\n\ncriminal petitioners is restricted to colorable constitutional\n\nclaims and issues of law.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C) and (D).\n\n          In   his   petition    for    review   to   this   court,   McGruer\n\npresents two arguments that the Maine felony marijuana cultivation\n\n\n\n     1\n          In fact, McGruer has a criminal history of at least five\noffenses, including burglary, theft, assault, and two drug\noffenses.   Only two of these offenses were presented by the\ngovernment as bases for removal, one of which is at issue here.\n     The government had appealed to the BIA from the IJ's holding\nthat it had not proven that McGruer's separate conviction in 1994\nof burglary and sentence of two years' imprisonment was not an\naggravated felony. The BIA bypassed this issue as moot, as do we.\n     McGruer had also been convicted of the misdemeanor of\ncultivating less than five marijuana plants in 2001. That was not\ncounted as an aggravated felony.\n     2\n          Neither the BIA nor we make any assumptions that in fact\nthe marijuana McGruer cultivated was meant for his personal use or\nthat in fact he cultivated only six marijuana plants out of the\nrange of more than five but fewer than one-hundred plants. The\ndocket entries of the record of conviction do not reveal these\ndetails. Even if those assumptions were true, McGruer still has\ncommitted a state crime which counts as an aggravated felony under\nfederal law.\n\n                                    -3-\n\foffense is not a federal aggravated felony.3      His first argument is\n\nthat there must be a commercial element to the state offense in\n\norder for it to be a federal drug trafficking offense, an argument\n\nwe reject.\n\n          The   BIA's   rejection   of    McGruer's   commercial   purpose\n\nargument was correct.      The BIA also correctly recognized the\n\ndeference it owed to federal court construction of the pertinent\n\nstatutes, particularly a First Circuit precedent, which rejected\n\nthe same argument.   See United States v. One Parcel of Real Estate\n\nProperty, 960 F.2d 200, 205 (1st Cir. 1992) (rejecting claim that\n\nmarijuana grown for personal use is not within reach of § 841(e)).\n\nThe other federal circuit courts that have addressed the issue\n\nagree.   See, e.g., United States v. Miller, 870 F.2d 1067, 1071\n\n(6th Cir. 1989); United States v. Roberts, 747 F.2d 537, 547 (9th\n\nCir. 1989); United States v. Klein, 850 F.2d 404, 405 (8th Cir.\n\n1988).\n\n          McGruer also presents a second argument in his petition\n\nfor review.   He argues that cultivation under the Maine statute is\n\nnot a per se federal trafficking offense because Maine's definition\n\nof cultivation includes possession of a marijuana plant. In making\n\n\n\n     3\n          McGruer also observes that, under Maine law, cultivation\nis explicitly excluded from the definition of \"trafficking.\" Me.\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 1101(17). But this is irrelevant.\nThe question is whether McGruer's state conviction falls within the\nfederal definition of a drug trafficking offense. See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 924(c)(2).\n\n                                    -4-\n\fthis argument, McGruer refers to the statute's definition of\n\ncultivation as \"to sow a seed; to grow, raise or tend to a plant;\n\nto harvest a plant; or to knowingly possess a plant.\"       Me. Rev.\n\nStat. tit 17-A § 1101(21).         Ignoring the distinction between\n\npossession of plants and possession of dried marijuana plant parts\n\nmeant for inhaling or ingesting, McGruer argues that he did not\n\ncommit an aggravated felony because mere possession of marijuana is\n\nnot a felony under federal law.      See Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S.\n\n47, 53 (2006).   He says the DHS has not shown which of the various\n\ndefinitions of cultivation was involved in his state conviction,\n\nand that it might have been mere possession, and that this is not\n\nenough to meet the government's burden.\n\n           We have no jurisdiction to reach this second argument\n\nbecause McGruer failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to\n\nit.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1).   The BIA's opinion does not respond\n\nto this argument, and there is a reason for that.   The argument was\n\nnot made before the IJ, nor was it made to the BIA.4         McGruer\n\n\n      4\n          Despite conceding that he fully understood the charges in\nthe October 2007 Notice to Appear (NTA), McGruer argued to the IJ\nthat the original NTA did not give him adequate notice because he\nwas convicted of cultivation and not, as the NTA said, of the\noffense of \"Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance to wit,\nCultivating Marijuana in violation of 17-A, Maine Criminal Codes,\nSubsection 1117(1)(B)(3).\" Additional charges of removability were\nadded which referred to conviction of a violation of the laws of a\nState relating to a controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. § 802,\nother than a single offense involving possession for one's own use\nof 30 grams or less of marijuana.\n     Before the BIA, McGruer made a brief eleven-line argument that\n\"Maine cultivation includes possession,\" and that \"DHS itself\n\n                                   -5-\n\ftherefore did not preserve it for judicial review.               See Larios v.\n\nHolder, 608 F.3d 105, 110 (1st Cir. 2010) (\"[B]ecause [petitioner]\n\nfailed to properly raise this claim before the IJ, this argument is\n\ndeemed waived on appeal.\"); Ahmed v. Holder, 611 F.3d 90, 97 (1st\n\nCir. 2010) (\"[A]rguments not made before the BIA may not make their\n\ndebut   in   a   petition   for   judicial   review   of   the    BIA's   final\n\norder.\").     As we have no jurisdiction over the issue, we do not\n\nreach the merits nor discuss it further.\n\n             The BIA correctly held that McGruer was removable and was\n\nnot eligible for the relief of cancellation of removal.\n\n                                     II.\n\n             We vacate the stay of removal that we previously issued\n\nto give us time to consider the issues and we deny McGruer's\n\npetition for review.\n\n             So ordered.\n\n\n\n\ncharacterized [McGruer's] violations [as] possessions in the Notice\nto Appear.\"    The BIA did not view this as making the second\nargument he now makes in his petition, nor do we.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f",
