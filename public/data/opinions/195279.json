Appellant  Bruce T.  Raineri appeals\n                     \n\nfrom  the dismissal  of his  complaint based  on 42  U.C.S.  \n\n1983.  He asserted that health providers at the New Hampshire\n\njail where he was  incarcerated violated the Eighth Amendment\n\nby providing  constitutionally deficient medical care.  After\n\ncarefully reviewing the record and the briefs of the parties,\n\nwe  agree with the reasoning  of the district court contained\n\nin its  Order, dated  June 24,  1993.   We add the  following\n\ncomments concerning the grant of summary judgment to appellee\n\nBarbara  Condon and  the dismissal  of the  complaint against\n\nHillsborough  County House of  Corrections (Hillsborough) and\n\nits  medical  provider,  Pennsylvania   Institutional  Health\n\nServices, Inc. (PIHS).\n\n          To prevail  on a  motion for summary  judgment, the\n\nmoving party must \"show that there is no genuine issue  as to\n\nany material fact  and that the moving party is entitled to a\n\njudgment as a matter  of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.  56(c).  Once\n\nthe  movant has met this  standard, the burden  shifts to the\n\nnon-moving party to establish the existence  of \"at least one\n\nissue that  is  both `genuine'  and  `material.'\"   Kelly  v.\n                                                         \n\nUnited States,  924 F.2d 355,  357 (1st Cir.  1991) (citation\n             \n\nomitted); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n\n          In support  of  her motion  for  summary  judgment,\n\nCondon submitted  her own affidavit  and appellant's  medical\n\nrecords.    She  argues,  and  the  dispensary  cards  (which\n\nchronicle each contact appellant  had with the medical staff)\n\nshow,  that the first  time appellant brought  up the problem\n\nwith  the  timing  of his  morning  dose  of  insulin was  on\n\nSeptember 28 or  29, 1992.   About three  days later,  Condon\n\ninstituted  the change  in the  time at  which appellant  ate\n\nbreakfast to conform to his request that the insulin be given\n\nwithin one-half hour of  his morning meal.   The rest of  the\n\ndispensary  cards  reveal  that  from  June  23,  1992  until\n\nSeptember  28, 1992,  insulin was  given to  appellant daily,\n\napparently without complaint.\n\n          In  opposition  to  the  summary  judgment  motion,\n\nappellant  did  not  file  any  affidavits  or  other  record\n\nevidence\n\nHowever, his complaint is \"verified\" in the sense that it was\n\nmade  under  \"the  pains  and  penalties  of  perjury.\"    In\n\nSheinkopf  v. Stone, 927 F.2d  1259 (1st Cir.  1991), we held\n                   \n\nthat, under  certain circumstances, a  verified complaint can\n\nsuffice for  Rule  56 purposes.    Id. at  1262.   Thus,  the\n                                      \n\nfactual statements in the  complaint, to the extent  they can\n\nbe deemed  to come  within appellant's knowledge,  are \"fully\n\ntantamount  to  a  counter-affidavit, and  hence,  worthy  of\n\nconsideration.\"  Id. at  1262-63.  Conclusory allegations are\n                    \n\ndisregarded.  Id. at 1262.  \n                 \n\n          To state an Eighth Amendment claim, appellant  must\n\nadduce  evidence concerning his medical treatment that raises\n\n                             -3-\n\nan  inference that  Condon's actions  amounted to  the wanton\n\ninfliction of unnecessary  pain.  See Estelle v.  Gamble, 429\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  97, 104  (1976).   \"Deliberate indifference  to serious\n\nmedical needs of prisoners\" satisfies this standard.  Id.  In\n                                                         \n\nturn, this standard  has two components:   (1) the subjection\n\nof the prisoner to  a \"sufficiently serious deprivation\"; and\n\n(2) acts that amount  to \"wanton disregard\" of the  rights of\n\nthe  inmate.  DesRosiers v. Moran, 949  F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n1991).   Negligence  and inadvertence  in  providing  medical\n\ntreatment  do   not  state   a  valid  claim   of  deliberate\n\nindifference.  Estelle, 429 U.S. at 105-06.\n                      \n\n          Appellant states  in Complaint A that he complained\n\nfrequently, if not daily, about the scheduling of his morning\n\ndose  of  insulin.   Given  that  this allegation  is  within\n\nappellant's knowledge,  we think that the  district court was\n\ncorrect  in crediting  this assertion.   However,  it  is not\n\nsufficient to  defeat Condon's summary judgment  motion.  The\n\nrecord plainly  reveals that  appellant received, on  a daily\n\nbasis, the insulin he  required.  Moreover, he  was monitored\n\nclosely by the medical staff, often being seen more than once\n\nper day.\n\n          Where a prisoner's dispute is not with the lack  of\n\nhelp,  but  with  his  course  of  treatment,  we  have  been\n\nreluctant  to  find  deliberate  indifference.    Torraco  v.\n                                                         \n\nMaloney,  923 F.2d  231, 234  (1st Cir.  1991).   A treatment\n       \n\n                             -4-\n\nregime can  amount to  deliberate indifference only  where it\n\neffectively results  in a  complete denial of  basic care  --\n\nthat is, treatment which  is so deficient that it  shocks the\n\nconscience.  Id.  This is not such a case.\n                \n\n          Basically, appellant fails to assert any facts that\n\nsatisfy the  first component  of the  deliberate indifference\n\nstandard -- a \"sufficiently  serious deprivation\" as a result\n\nof Condon's  actions.   All  that  appellant alleges  in  his\n\nverified complaint is that  he suffered \"irreparable harm\" as\n\nthe result of the  treatment he received.1  This  is the kind\n\nof  conclusory  allegation that  is  to  be disregarded  even\n\nthough contained in a verified complaint.  See Sheinkopf, 927\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at 1262.   In  the absence  of an  adequately supported\n\nfactual scenario  that  appellant suffered  specific  medical\n\nconsequences  related  to Condon's  treatment  choices  -- an\n\nessential  element  of  his   case  --  summary  judgment  is\n\nappropriate.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322\n                                          \n\n(1986).\n\n          Finally,  there was  no error  in the  dismissal of\n\nappellant's complaint against Hillsborough.  Appellant failed\n\n                    \n\n1.  Appellant asserts, for the first time on appeal, that due\nto Condon's refusal to reschedule his insulin doses, he  went\ninto a  diabetic reaction on four occasions and suffered from\nsevere  headaches  --  a  symptom of  an  impending  diabetic\nreaction.   Issues  not presented  below normally  are deemed\nwaived.  Knight  v. Mills, 836  F.2d 659, 664  n.6 (1st  Cir.\n                         \n1987).   We see  no reason to  depart from this  rule in this\ncase.\n\n                             -5-\n\nto  allege that  any  action  or  omission  on  the  part  of\n\nHillsborough  was taken  pursuant  to an  official policy  or\n\ncustom.   See  Monell  v.  New  York  City  Dep't  of  Social\n                                                             \n\nServices, 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978).  As for PIHS,  it may not\n        \n\nbe held liable solely on the  basis that it was the  employer\n\nof Condon.  See id. at 691.\n                   \n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                             -6-\n",

He asserted that health providers at the New Hampshire jail where he was incarcerated violated the Eighth Amendment by providing constitutionally deficient medical care.  After carefully reviewing the record and the briefs of the parties, we agree with the reasoning of the district court contained in its Order, dated June 24, 1993.  We add the following comments concerning the grant of summary judgment to appellee Barbara Condon and the dismissal of the complaint against Hillsborough County House of Corrections (Hillsborough) and its medical provider, Pennsylvania Institutional Health Services, Inc.  (PIHS).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail on a motion for summary judgment, the moving party must \"show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  Once the movant has met this standard, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to establish the existence of \"at least one issue that is both 'genuine' and 'material.' \"   Kelly v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555046\"><a href=\"/opinion/555046/john-l-kelly-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span>, 357 (1st Cir. 1991) (citation omitted);  Fed.  R. Civ. P. 56(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of her motion for summary judgment, Condon submitted her own affidavit and appellant's medical records.  She argues, and the dispensary cards (which chronicle each contact appellant had with the medical staff) show, that the first time appellant brought up the problem with the timing of his morning dose of insulin was on September 28 or 29, 1992.  About three days later, Condon instituted the change in the time at which appellant ate breakfast to conform to his request that the insulin be given within one-half hour of his morning meal.  The rest of the dispensary cards reveal that from June 23, 1992 until September 28, 1992, insulin was given to appellant daily, apparently without complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In opposition to the summary judgment motion, appellant did not file any affidavits or other record evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, his complaint is \"verified\" in the sense that it was made under \"the pains and penalties of perjury.\"  In  Sheinkopf v. Stone, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557334\"><a href=\"/opinion/557334/warren-b-sheinkopf-v-john-kp-stone-iii-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1991), we held that, under certain circumstances, a verified complaint can suffice for Rule 56 purposes.   Id. at 1262.  Thus, the factual statements in the complaint, to the extent they can be deemed to come within appellant's knowledge, are \"fully tantamount to a counter-affidavit, and hence, worthy of consideration.\"   Id. at 1262-63.  Conclusory allegations are disregarded.   Id. at 1262.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To state an Eighth Amendment claim, appellant must adduce evidence concerning his medical treatment that raises an inference that Condon's actions amounted to the wanton infliction of unnecessary pain.   See Estelle v. Gamble, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 104 (1976).  \"Deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners\" satisfies this standard.  Id. In turn, this standard has two components:  (1) the subjection of the prisoner to a \"sufficiently serious deprivation\";  and (2) acts that amount to \"wanton disregard\" of the rights of the inmate.   DesRosiers v. Moran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572165\"><a href=\"/opinion/572165/steven-m-desrosiers-v-john-j-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir. 1991).  Negligence and inadvertence in providing medical treatment do not state a valid claim of deliberate indifference.   Estelle, 429 U.S. at 105-06.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant states in Complaint A that he complained frequently, if not daily, about the scheduling of his morning dose of insulin.  Given that this allegation is within appellant's knowledge, we think that the district court was correct in crediting this assertion.  However, it is not sufficient to defeat Condon's summary judgment motion.  The record plainly reveals that appellant received, on a daily basis, the insulin he required.  Moreover, he was monitored closely by the medical staff, often being seen more than once per day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a prisoner's dispute is not with the lack of help, but with his course of treatment, we have been reluctant to find deliberate indifference.   Torraco v. Maloney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554023\"><a href=\"/opinion/554023/ellen-torraco-etc-v-michael-maloney-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 234 (1st Cir. 1991).  A treatment regime can amount to deliberate indifference only where it effectively results in a complete denial of basic care-that is, treatment which is so deficient that it shocks the conscience.  Id. This is not such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Basically, appellant fails to assert any facts that satisfy the first component of the deliberate indifference standard-a \"sufficiently serious deprivation\" as a result of Condon's actions.  All that appellant alleges in his verified complaint is that he suffered \"irreparable harm\" as the result of the treatment he received.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  This is the kind of conclusory allegation that is to be disregarded even though contained in a verified complaint.   See Sheinkopf, 927 F.2d at 1262.  In the absence of an adequately supported factual scenario that appellant suffered specific medical consequences related to Condon's treatment choices-an essential element of his case-summary judgment is appropriate.   See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 322 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there was no error in the dismissal of appellant's complaint against Hillsborough.  Appellant failed to allege that any action or omission on the part of Hillsborough was taken pursuant to an official policy or custom.   See Monell v. New York City Dep't of Social Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>, 694 (1978).  As for PIHS, it may not be held liable solely on the basis that it was the employer of Condon.  See id. at 691.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellant asserts, for the first time on appeal, that due to Condon's refusal to reschedule his insulin doses, he went into a diabetic reaction on four occasions and suffered from severe headaches-a symptom of an impending diabetic reaction.  Issues not presented below normally are deemed waived.   Knight v. Mills, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499724\"><a href=\"/opinion/499724/norman-knight-v-mark-j-mills-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span>, 664 n. 6 (1st Cir. 1987).  We see no reason to depart from this rule in this case</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
