Appellant Johnny\n                                         \n\nBetances  Diaz was  tried to  a  jury and  convicted in  the\n\nUnited   States   District   Court  for   the   District  of\n\nMassachusetts  for  conspiracy  to possess  with  intent  to\n\ndistribute five or  more kilograms of cocaine,  in violation\n\nof  21  U.S.C.      841(a)(1)  and  846.    He  appeals  his\n\nconviction and contends  that:  (1) the  evidence introduced\n\nagainst him was  insufficient to support the  guilty verdict\n\nreturned  by  the  jury, (2)  the  district  court erred  in\n\nadmitting  a hearsay statement made by a co-conspirator, and\n\n(3) the  district court improperly  denied his motion  for a\n\nseverance.  We affirm.1\n\n                             I.\n\n          As   recounted  in  United   States  v.  Matiz,  a\n                                                        \n\ncompanion case decided contemporaneously herewith, this case\n\narose  out of  a  large  scale  investigation  conducted  by\n\nvarious  government   agencies  in  the  United  States  and\n\nColombia,  South  America  into   the  cocaine  distribution\n\nactivities  of a number  of individuals.   The United States\n\n(the  Government) had  the assistance  of  Pedro Alvarez,  a\n\ndefendant in another criminal matter.\n\n                    \n\n1 The district  court possessed subject matter  jurisdiction\npursuant to 18  U.S.C.   3231.  This  court has jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1291 and 18 U.S.C.   3742 (a)(2).\n\n          Alvarez, at the behest of the Government, posed as\n\na purchaser and  contacted a number of  cocaine suppliers in\n\nColombia.      Negotiations  ensued   over   several  months\n\npertaining to the  purchase of large quantities  of cocaine.\n\nIn  the  early  part  of  1991,  the  suppliers in  Colombia\n\ninformed  Alvarez  that  they  were  experiencing  temporary\n\ndifficulties  in  smuggling  the  cocaine  into  the  United\n\nStates.   In light of these difficulties, they asked Alvarez\n\nto  assist them in transporting the shipment.  Additionally,\n\nthe  suppliers asked  Alvarez to  store  and distribute  the\n\ncocaine to their associates.\n\n          The Government  instructed Alvarez  to request  an\n\nup-front  payment  from  the suppliers  of  $30,000  for his\n\ntroubles  and expenses.   Reluctantly, the  suppliers agreed\n\nand told  Alvarez that the  payment would be made  by one of\n\ntheir New York based associates, \"La Negra,\" a code name for\n\nNancy Esperanza Matiz.\n\n          Alvarez and Matiz  ultimately scheduled a  meeting\n\nfor  May 23, 1991,  for Matiz to  hand over the  money to an\n\nassociate of Alvarez, actually Special Agent Dominick Lopez,\n\nat a  Burger King  restaurant in Queens,  New York.   Matiz,\n\nhowever, failed to appear at the scheduled hour.  Only after\n\nMatiz twice contacted Diaz at his residence did  she finally\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\narrive  together  with him,  two  hours  late,  in a  Nissan\n\nPathfinder.  \n\n          As Lopez approached the vehicle he stated the code\n\nword  for the transaction, \"Cubito.\"  Diaz replied \"Cubita,\"\n\napparently correcting Lopez's  use of the masculine  form of\n\nthe word.  After Lopez entered the vehicle, Matiz instructed\n\nDiaz to get the money.  Diaz, without receiving instructions\n\nregarding  the  location  of the  money,  retrieved  it from\n\nunderneath the seat  of the car and  passed it to Matiz  who\n\nthen  gave  it to  Lopez.    In  response to  Lopez's  query\n\nregarding the amount of money contained in each bundle, both\n\nMatiz and Diaz disclosed the correct amount.2 \n\n          After  this  exchange,  Matiz  remained  in  close\n\ncontact  with  Alvarez.    She  informed  him  that she  was\n\npersonally  expecting  to  receive a  large  portion  of the\n\ncocaine shipment upon its arrival.   Upon learning the  date\n\non which the shipment consisting of 615 kilograms of cocaine\n\nwould arrive,  Matiz placed  nine telephone  calls of  short\n\nduration to Diaz.\n\n          After the cocaine shipment arrived, Alvarez called\n\nMatiz on numerous  occasions to discuss  the details of  the\n\n                    \n\n2The sum amounted to only $20,000 and Matiz promised to make\nan additional  payment of  $5,000 the  next day,  explaining\nthat she had been told that the amount due was $25,000.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\npickup  of  her  portion  of  the  cocaine.    During  these\n\nconversations,  Matiz  expressed her  desire  to obtain  her\n\nshare as  soon as possible.   Initially, she also  voiced an\n\ninterest in purchasing some of  the cocaine that Alvarez had\n\nreceived   as  his   fee  for   transporting  the   cocaine.\n\nUltimately,  however,  she  decided  against it  because  of\n\nfinancial constraints.\n\n          Finally, Alvarez informed Matiz that she would  be\n\nable to  collect her allocation  of the cocaine on  June 12,\n\n1991.   Alvarez  reserved a  hotel room  for Matiz  under an\n\nassumed  name in Middleboro, Massachusetts near the site for\n\nthe transfer of the cocaine.  Matiz arrived  at the hotel on\n\nJune  10, along  with Diaz  who also used  a false  name and\n\nfictitious  address to  check in.    The following  evening,\n\nAlvarez  and Matiz  met at  the  hotel to  review the  final\n\narrangements   for  the  pickup.     A  number   of  Matiz's\n\nassistants, who had arrived at the  hotel on the same day as\n\nMatiz, were designated to collect the cocaine.  \n\n          At   the  time  of  the  pickup,  one  of  Matiz's\n\nassistants  followed  an undercover  agent to  the warehouse\n\nwhere the  car was loaded.  Matiz,  however, remained behind\n\nat the hotel with another  undercover agent, Dillon, who was\n\nto accompany her to a meeting with Alvarez to discuss future\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\ncocaine shipments.  Before departing, Matiz introduced  Diaz\n\nto  Dillon as her husband.  She then informed Diaz that \"the\n\nboys\" had gone  to load the  car.  Diaz  asked how long  the\n\nloading  would take and  offered his own  estimate regarding\n\nthe length of the task.   As Matiz was leaving,  Diaz wished\n\nher  a  successful meeting.  In  the car,  Matiz  and Dillon\n\ndecided to purchase a bottle  of champagne to celebrate  the\n\ndeal.  On  the way to the  liquor store, Dillon  asked Matiz\n\nwhether  Diaz minded  that she  met with  other men  late at\n\nnight, as they  had done the night before.   Matiz responded\n\nthat Diaz  did not mind,  that he understood that  Matiz was\n\nworking,  that he  was aware  of the  business, and  that he\n\nliked the money.  Shortly  after an agent placed Matiz under\n\narrest, another agent arrested Diaz outside the hotel.\n\n                            II.\n\n              A.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n          Diaz first  contends that the evidence produced at\n\ntrial does not show that he was a member of  the conspiracy.\n\nEssentially, he  claims that  he was merely  present at  the\n\ntime of Matiz's activities but  did not participate in them.\n\n          In  evaluating a  claim  of insufficiency  of  the\n\nevidence, we \"review the evidence as a whole,  including all\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nreasonable  inferences from that evidence, in the light most\n\nfavorable  to the government.\"  United States v. Argencourt,\n                                                           \n\n996  F.2d 1300,  1303 (1st  Cir. 1993).   In  addition, both\n\ndirect  and  circumstantial  evidence must  be  credited  on\n\nappeal.  United States v.  Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir. 1993).   Thus, as long as a jury  could rationally find\n\nguilt beyond  a reasonable doubt,  we have no choice  but to\n\naffirm.  Argencourt, 996 F.2d at 1303. \n                   \n\n          Although, as the district  court acknowledged, the\n\nevidence  against  Diaz  was  \"thin\",  it  nevertheless  was\n\nsufficient  to  convict  him   beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.\n\nContrary   to  his  assertions,  Diaz  did  more  than  just\n\npassively  and  innocently accompany  Matiz in  her dealings\n\nwith respect  to  the  cocaine  purchase.   He  exhibited  a\n\nknowledge  of  and  participation in  the  conspiracy.   For\n\nexample,   at   the  encounter   with   agent  Lopez,   Diaz\n\nacknowledged the  correct code term for the transaction.  He\n\nalso  retrieved  the  money  without receiving  instructions\n\npertaining  to its location and stated the correct amount in\n\neach  bundle.    In  addition, at  key  moments  of  Matiz's\n\ninvolvement with the cocaine purchase, she communicated with\n\nDiaz.  Furthermore,  on the day of the  cocaine pickup, Diaz\n\nrevealed his familiarity  with the cocaine shipment  when he\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nasked  about the  length of  the  trip and  offered his  own\n\nestimate of  the time  it would take  to complete  the task.\n\nThe reasonable  inference to be drawn from  this evidence is\n\nthat Diaz was intimately involved with Matiz in planning and\n\nexecuting the  conspiracy.   Finally, Matiz  explicitly told\n\nagent Dillon  that Diaz knew  she was working, was  aware of\n\nthe business,  and that he liked the  money.  Based upon the\n\nadmitted evidence,  a jury reasonably  could have  concluded\n\nthat  Diaz knowingly  participated in the  conspiracy rather\n\nthan merely acting as a disinterested bystander.\n\n                            II.\n\n              B.  Statement of Co-Conspirator\n\n          Diaz next maintains that the  district court erred\n\nin   admitting,  pursuant  to   Federal  Rule   of  Evidence\n\n801(d)(2)(E),  Matiz's  statement  implicating  him  in  the\n\nconspiracy.   He argues that  the statement was not  made in\n\nthe course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy.  \n\n          To  admit  a  co-conspirator's   statement  as  an\n\nexception to the hearsay rule, a court must find that \"it is\n\nmore likely than  not that the declarant  and defendant were\n\nmembers of a conspiracy when the hearsay statement was made,\n\nand  that   the  statement   was  in   furtherance  of   the\n\nconspiracy.\"  United States v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 23\n                                           \n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\n(1st  Cir.   1977).     The  district   court  conducted   a\n\nPetrozziello  hearing   and   found   these   facts   by   a\n            \n\npreponderance of the evidence.   We must accept the district\n\ncourt's finding  unless the  finding was  clearly erroneous.\n\nSee United States v. Patterson,  644 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir.\n                              \n\n1981).\n\n          A   co-conspirator's   statement    is   made   in\n\nfurtherance  of a  conspiracy if  it \"'tends to  advance the\n\nobjects  of the  conspiracy  as  opposed  to  thwarting  its\n\npurpose.'\"  United  States v. Masse, 816 F.2d  805, 811 (1st\n                                   \n\ncir. 1987)  (quoting United States  v. Fahey, 769  F.2d 829,\n                                            \n\n839 (1st Cir. 1985)).  On the  way to a meeting with Alvarez\n\nto  discuss  future  shipments  of   cocaine,  Agent  Dillon\n\ninquired  whether  Diaz,  who  was  introduced   as  Matiz's\n\nhusband,  minded the  late night  meetings  with other  men.\n\nUnderstood  in this context, the purpose of Dillon's inquiry\n\nwas  to  determine  the   extent  of  Diaz's  role  in   the\n\nconspiracy.  Matiz answered that Diaz knew what was going on\n\nand was  pleased with  the money.   This statement  was made\n\nduring  the conspiracy  and  tended  to  further  its  goals\n\nbecause  it provided Dillon  with some measure  of assurance\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nthat Matiz could carry out her end of the conspiracy without\n\nobstruction on the part of her husband.3  \n\n                       C. Severance \n\n          Finally, Diaz argues that the district court erred\n\nby  denying  his  motion  for a  severance.  He  argues that\n\nseverance  was  necessary  in  order  to  safeguard  against\n\nprejudicial spillover.      Spillover occurs \"where evidence\n\nestablishing  the guilt of one defendant, but not admissible\n\nagainst the  other, may  create an  atmosphere clouding  the\n\njury's ability to evaluate fairly the guilt or innocence  of\n\nthe latter.\"  United States  v. Perkins, 926 F.2d 1271, 1281\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir. 1991).  \n\n          We review the  denial of a severance  motion under\n\nFed. R.  Crim. P. 14 for abuse of discretion.  United States\n                                                            \n\nv.  Innamorati,  996 F.2d  456,  469  (1st  Cir. 1993).    A\n              \n\ndistrict court's decision not to sever  can only be reversed\n\nupon  a defendant's  maintenance  of  the  heavy  burden  of\n\nshowing substantial prejudice amounting to  a miscarriage of\n\n                    \n\n3Moreover,   in  light   of   the  other   evidence,  albeit\ncircumstantial, introduced  at trial  implicating Diaz  as a\nmember  of the  conspiracy,  any  error  accruing  from  the\nadmission of the statement would be harmless. \n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\njustice.   Id.  Substantial prejudice, however, is extremely\n              \n\ndifficult to prove where, as here, there are obvious reasons\n\nof economy  in trying  Diaz with  his co-conspirator  Matiz.\n\nFed. R.  Crim. P.  8(b).   \"Co-conspirators are  customarily\n\ntried  together  absent  a  strong  showing  of  prejudice.\"\n\nPerkins, 926 F.2d  at 1280.  Evidence regarding  the acts of\n       \n\nMatiz would  have  been admissible  against Diaz  even in  a\n\nseparate trial, as co-conspirators are liable for all of the\n\ncriminal  acts carried out in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nSee United  States v.  Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996  F.2d 436,  440\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir. 1993).  Moreover,  the court's instructions to the\n\njury  that the  guilt of each  defendant must  be determined\n\nindividually  provided  a   further  safeguard  against  the\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nspillover   effect.4    Thus,   Diaz  has  failed   to  show\n\nsubstantial prejudice because of the joint trial.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                    \n\n4 The court warned the jury as follows:\n\n          And I  will throughout  refer mostly  to\n          the defendant, and I will explain to you\n          later on  that as  to one  part of  this\n          case,  you must be very sure to view the\n          evidence as to  each separately, because\n          each    is    entitled    to    separate\n          consideration from you. . . .\n\n          Now, here  it is very important that you\n          review   the   evidence   as   to   each\n          separately.  The government has to prove\n          as  to each  of  them  that  he  or  she\n          knowingly  and   willfully  joined   the\n          unlawful scheme, with  the understanding\n          of its unlawful character.\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n",

Secs. 841(a)(1) and 846.  He appeals his conviction and contends that:  (1) the evidence introduced against him was insufficient to support the guilty verdict returned by the jury, (2) the district court erred in admitting a hearsay statement made by a co-conspirator, and (3) the district court improperly denied his motion for a severance.  We affirm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As recounted in United States v. Matiz, a companion case decided contemporaneously herewith, this case arose out of a large scale investigation conducted by various government agencies in the United States and Colombia, South America into the cocaine distribution activities of a number of individuals.  The United States (the Government) had the assistance of Pedro Alvarez, a defendant in another criminal matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alvarez, at the behest of the Government, posed as a purchaser and contacted a number of cocaine suppliers in Colombia.  Negotiations ensued over several months pertaining to the purchase of large quantities of cocaine.  In the early part of 1991, the suppliers in Colombia informed Alvarez that they were experiencing temporary difficulties in smuggling the cocaine into the United States.  In light of these difficulties, they asked Alvarez to assist them in transporting the shipment.  Additionally, the suppliers asked Alvarez to store and distribute the cocaine to their associates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government instructed Alvarez to request an up-front payment from the suppliers of $30,000 for his troubles and expenses.  Reluctantly, the suppliers agreed and told Alvarez that the payment would be made by one of their New York based associates, \"La Negra,\" a code name for Nancy Esperanza Matiz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alvarez and Matiz ultimately scheduled a meeting for May 23, 1991, for Matiz to hand over the money to an associate of Alvarez, actually Special Agent Dominick Lopez, at a Burger King restaurant in Queens, New York.  Matiz, however, failed to appear at the scheduled hour.  Only after Matiz twice contacted Diaz at his residence did she finally arrive together with him, two hours late, in a Nissan Pathfinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Lopez approached the vehicle he stated the code word for the transaction, \"Cubito.\"  Diaz replied \"Cubita,\" apparently correcting Lopez's use of the masculine form of the word.  After Lopez entered the vehicle, Matiz instructed Diaz to get the money.  Diaz, without receiving instructions regarding the location of the money, retrieved it from underneath the seat of the car and passed it to Matiz who then gave it to Lopez.  In response to Lopez's query regarding the amount of money contained in each bundle, both Matiz and Diaz disclosed the correct amount.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this exchange, Matiz remained in close contact with Alvarez.  She informed him that she was personally expecting to receive a large portion of the cocaine shipment upon its arrival.  Upon learning the date on which the shipment consisting of 615 kilograms of cocaine would arrive, Matiz placed nine telephone calls of short duration to Diaz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the cocaine shipment arrived, Alvarez called Matiz on numerous occasions to discuss the details of the pickup of her portion of the cocaine.  During these conversations, Matiz expressed her desire to obtain her share as soon as possible.  Initially, she also voiced an interest in purchasing some of the cocaine that Alvarez had received as his fee for transporting the cocaine.  Ultimately, however, she decided against it because of financial constraints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Alvarez informed Matiz that she would be able to collect her allocation of the cocaine on June 12, 1991.  Alvarez reserved a hotel room for Matiz under an assumed name in Middleboro, Massachusetts near the site for the transfer of the cocaine.  Matiz arrived at the hotel on June 10, along with Diaz who also used a false name and fictitious address to check in.  The following evening, Alvarez and Matiz met at the hotel to review the final arrangements for the pickup.  A number of Matiz's assistants, who had arrived at the hotel on the same day as Matiz, were designated to collect the cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the pickup, one of Matiz's assistants followed an undercover agent to the warehouse where the car was loaded.  Matiz, however, remained behind at the hotel with another undercover agent, Dillon, who was to accompany her to a meeting with Alvarez to discuss future cocaine shipments.  Before departing, Matiz introduced Diaz to Dillon as her husband.  She then informed Diaz that \"the boys\" had gone to load the car.  Diaz asked how long the loading would take and offered his own estimate regarding the length of the task.  As Matiz was leaving, Diaz wished her a successful meeting.  In the car, Matiz and Dillon decided to purchase a bottle of champagne to celebrate the deal.  On the way to the liquor store, Dillon asked Matiz whether Diaz minded that she met with other men late at night, as they had done the night before.  Matiz responded that Diaz did not mind, that he understood that Matiz was working, that he was aware of the business, and that he liked the money.  Shortly after an agent placed Matiz under arrest, another agent arrested Diaz outside the hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diaz first contends that the evidence produced at trial does not show that he was a member of the conspiracy.  Essentially, he claims that he was merely present at the time of Matiz's activities but did not participate in them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating a claim of insufficiency of the evidence, we \"review the evidence as a whole, including all reasonable inferences from that evidence, in the light most favorable to the government.\"   United States v. Argencourt, 996 F.2d 1300, 1303 (1st Cir. 1993).  In addition, both direct and circumstantial evidence must be credited on appeal.   United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir. 1993).  Thus, as long as a jury could rationally find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, we have no choice but to affirm.   Argencourt, 996 F.2d at 1303.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although, as the district court acknowledged, the evidence against Diaz was \"thin\", it nevertheless was sufficient to convict him beyond a reasonable doubt.  Contrary to his assertions, Diaz did more than just passively and innocently accompany Matiz in her dealings with respect to the cocaine purchase.  He exhibited a knowledge of and participation in the conspiracy.  For example, at the encounter with agent Lopez, Diaz acknowledged the correct code term for the transaction.  He also retrieved the money without receiving instructions pertaining to its location and stated the correct amount in each bundle.  In addition, at key moments of Matiz's involvement with the cocaine purchase, she communicated with Diaz.  Furthermore, on the day of the cocaine pickup, Diaz revealed his familiarity with the cocaine shipment when he asked about the length of the trip and offered his own estimate of the time it would take to complete the task.  The reasonable inference to be drawn from this evidence is that Diaz was intimately involved with Matiz in planning and executing the conspiracy.  Finally, Matiz explicitly told agent Dillon that Diaz knew she was working, was aware of the business, and that he liked the money.  Based upon the admitted evidence, a jury reasonably could have concluded that Diaz knowingly participated in the conspiracy rather than merely acting as a disinterested bystander.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>B. Statement of Co-Conspirator</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diaz next maintains that the district court erred in admitting, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E), Matiz's statement implicating him in the conspiracy.  He argues that the statement was not made in the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To admit a co-conspirator's statement as an exception to the hearsay rule, a court must find that \"it is more likely than not that the declarant and defendant were members of a conspiracy when the hearsay statement was made, and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"   United States v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1977).  The district court conducted a Petrozziello hearing and found these facts by a preponderance of the evidence.  We must accept the district court's finding unless the finding was clearly erroneous.   See United States v. Patterson, 644 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir. 1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A co-conspirator's statement is made in furtherance of a conspiracy if it \" 'tends to advance the objects of the conspiracy as opposed to thwarting its purpose.' \"   United States v. Masse, 816 F.2d 805, 811 (1st cir. 1987) (quoting  United States v. Fahey, 769 F.2d 829, 839 (1st Cir. 1985)).  On the way to a meeting with Alvarez to discuss future shipments of cocaine, Agent Dillon inquired whether Diaz, who was introduced as Matiz's husband, minded the late night meetings with other men.  Understood in this context, the purpose of Dillon's inquiry was to determine the extent of Diaz's role in the conspiracy.  Matiz answered that Diaz knew what was going on and was pleased with the money.  This statement was made during the conspiracy and tended to further its goals because it provided Dillon with some measure of assurance that Matiz could carry out her end of the conspiracy without obstruction on the part of her husband.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Severance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Diaz argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for a severance.  He argues that severance was necessary in order to safeguard against prejudicial spillover.  Spillover occurs \"where evidence establishing the guilt of one defendant, but not admissible against the other, may create an atmosphere clouding the jury's ability to evaluate fairly the guilt or innocence of the latter.\"   United States v. Perkins, 926 F.2d 1271, 1281 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a severance motion under Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 14 for abuse of discretion.   United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 469 (1st Cir. 1993).  A district court's decision not to sever can only be reversed upon a defendant's maintenance of the heavy burden of showing substantial prejudice amounting to a miscarriage of justice.  Id. Substantial prejudice, however, is extremely difficult to prove where, as here, there are obvious reasons of economy in trying Diaz with his co-conspirator Matiz.  Fed. R. Crim.  P. 8(b).  \"Co-conspirators are customarily tried together absent a strong showing of prejudice.\"   Perkins, 926 F.2d at 1280.  Evidence regarding the acts of Matiz would have been admissible against Diaz even in a separate trial, as co conspirators are liable for all of the criminal acts carried out in furtherance of the conspiracy.   See United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia, 996 F.2d 436, 440 (1st Cir. 1993).  Moreover, the court's instructions to the jury that the guilt of each defendant must be determined individually provided a further safeguard against the spillover effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, Diaz has failed to show substantial prejudice because of the joint trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

He argues that the statement was not made in the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To admit a co-conspirator's statement as an exception to the hearsay rule, a court must find that \"it is more likely than not that the declarant and defendant were members of a conspiracy when the hearsay statement was made, and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"   United States v. Petrozziello, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342283\"><a href=\"/opinion/342283/united-states-v-ralph-petrozziello/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir. 1977).  The district court conducted a Petrozziello hearing and found these facts by a preponderance of the evidence.  We must accept the district court's finding unless the finding was clearly erroneous.   See United States v. Patterson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"388752\"><a href=\"/opinion/388752/united-states-v-preston-t-patterson-united-states-of-america-v-benjamin/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></a></span>, 894 (1st Cir. 1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A co-conspirator's statement is made in furtherance of a conspiracy if it \" 'tends to advance the objects of the conspiracy as opposed to thwarting its purpose.' \"   United States v. Masse, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487126\"><a href=\"/opinion/487126/united-states-v-stephen-o-masse/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span>, 811 (1st cir. 1987) (quoting  United States v. Fahey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"456323\"><a href=\"/opinion/456323/united-states-v-joseph-p-fahey/\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></a></span>, 839 (1st Cir. 1985)).  On the way to a meeting with Alvarez to discuss future shipments of cocaine, Agent Dillon inquired whether Diaz, who was introduced as Matiz's husband, minded the late night meetings with other men.  Understood in this context, the purpose of Dillon's inquiry was to determine the extent of Diaz's role in the conspiracy.  Matiz answered that Diaz knew what was going on and was pleased with the money.  This statement was made during the conspiracy and tended to further its goals because it provided Dillon with some measure of assurance that Matiz could carry out her end of the conspiracy without obstruction on the part of her husband.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Severance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Diaz argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for a severance.  He argues that severance was necessary in order to safeguard against prejudicial spillover.  Spillover occurs \"where evidence establishing the guilt of one defendant, but not admissible against the other, may create an atmosphere clouding the jury's ability to evaluate fairly the guilt or innocence of the latter.\"   United States v. Perkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556607\"><a href=\"/opinion/556607/united-states-v-patrick-perkins-united-states-of-america-v-lois-perkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span>, 1281 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a severance motion under Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 14 for abuse of discretion.   United States v. Innamorati, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609734\"><a href=\"/opinion/609734/united-states-v-kenneth-innamorati-united-states-v-william-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 469 (1st Cir. 1993).  A district court's decision not to sever can only be reversed upon a defendant's maintenance of the heavy burden of showing substantial prejudice amounting to a miscarriage of justice.  Id. Substantial prejudice, however, is extremely difficult to prove where, as here, there are obvious reasons of economy in trying Diaz with his co-conspirator Matiz.  Fed. R. Crim.  P. 8(b).  \"Co-conspirators are customarily tried together absent a strong showing of prejudice.\"   Perkins, 926 F.2d at 1280.  Evidence regarding the acts of Matiz would have been admissible against Diaz even in a separate trial, as co conspirators are liable for all of the criminal acts carried out in furtherance of the conspiracy.   See United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoitia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609732\"><a href=\"/opinion/609732/united-states-v-luis-e-ortiz-arrigoitia-aka-colibri-united-states-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 440 (1st Cir. 1993).  Moreover, the court's instructions to the jury that the guilt of each defendant must be determined individually provided a further safeguard against the spillover effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, Diaz has failed to show substantial prejudice because of the joint trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
