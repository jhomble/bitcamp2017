In  the pre-\n\ndawn  of a  late  summer day  in Maine,  plaintiff-appellant1\n\nGerald  Poulin sustained  serious injuries after  driving his\n\ntruck  into  the  flatbed  of  a  tractor-trailer  which  was\n\nblocking the  road.   Subsequently, Poulin sued  the tractor-\n\ntrailer's driver,  Alexander Greer, and its  owner, McConnell\n\nTransport,  Ltd.  A jury  found defendants not  liable on the\n\nground that Greer's negligence was not the proximate cause of\n\nPoulin's injuries.2  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \n\n          It was a clear, dry morning on September 11,  1990.\n\nSometime before 5:00 a.m., while it was still dark, Greer was\n\ntravelling  south along Route 191 in Maine, hauling a load of\n\nbaled straw.   Having missed his turn-off, Greer attempted to\n\nturn  around in the driveway of Ray's Country Store which was\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  More precisely,  plaintiff-appellants in this  action are\nPoulin, who seeks damages for  his personal injuries, and his\nwife Brenda, who seeks damages for loss of consortium.\n\n2.  Although the  special  interrogatories submitted  to  the\njury instructed the  jury to stop  answering questions if  it\nfound that Greer's negligence was  not the proximate cause of\nPoulin's injuries,  the jury ignored this  directive and went\non to  find that Poulin's negligence was  the proximate cause\nof his injuries, and that Poulin's negligence was equal to or\ngreater than  Greer's.  Under  Maine law, the  latter finding\nwould have been sufficient to defeat  plaintiffs' claim.  See\r                                                                         \nMe.  Rev. Stat.  Ann. tit. 14,    156  (West 1980)  (\"If such\nclaimant is  found by the  jury to be  equally at fault,  the\nclaimant shall not recover.\").\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\n\nlocated  off the  west  side of  the road.   While  Greer was\n\nexecuting  this  maneuver, the  rear  wheels  of his  tractor\n\nbecame stuck  in a drainage  ditch off  the east side  of the\n\nroad.  The  tractor of  Greer's truck had  turned around  and\n\nfaced  north; the flatbed or trailer portion of the truck sat\n\nat  a forty-five degree angle across  the road, blocking both\n\nlanes of traffic.\n\n          Greer turned on  the yellow  revolving beacon  atop\n\nthe  tractor,  as well  as its  hazard  lights.   The truck's\n\nheadlights  were   on  low  beam,   facing  oncoming,   i.e.,\r                                                                        \n\nsouthbound, traffic.   Although  Greer testified that  he had\n\nreflective triangles  in the truck,  he never placed  them on\n\nthe  road as a warning  to approaching traffic.   The trailer\n\nhad a  reflector on both sides  of its base and  on each back\n\ncorner.\n\n          At  approximately  4:40 a.m.,  Horace  \"Denny\" Lyon\n\narrived at the scene.  Lyon was travelling north on Route 191\n\nwhen he saw the yellow revolving beacon of Greer's truck from\n\nabout  200  yards  away.    Initially  Lyon  thought  that  a\n\n\"wrecker\" was towing a disabled car off the  road.  He slowed\n\ndown as  he approached.   Once  Lyon was  within seventy-five\n\nfeet  of  the truck,  he realized  that  there was  a flatbed\n\ntrailer  loaded with straw blocking the road.  He pulled into\n\nthe driveway at Ray's, stopped his vehicle, and spoke briefly\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\n\nwith Greer.  After promising to call the police, Lyon went on\n\nhis way.\n\n          Shortly   before   5:00   a.m.,    another   driver\n\nencountered the jackknifed truck.   Ricky Frye was travelling\n\nnorth  on  Route 191  when he  saw  a large  black silhouette\n\nblocking the road  about 100 yards in  front of him.   Before\n\npulling into  the driveway  at Ray's,  Frye noticed the  rear\n\nreflectors on  Greer's  trailer.   After getting  out of  his\n\ntruck,  Frye  noticed that  the  yellow  revolving beacon  on\n\nGreer's truck and its headlights were both on.\n\n          The  crash occurred only minutes after Frye arrived\n\nat the  scene.  Both he  and Greer, who were  talking to each\n\nother  outside  of  Ray's  at  the  time,  saw  Poulin's  car\n\napproaching.  Unlike  Lyon and Frye, Poulin  was headed south\n\non  Route  191.   Although they  expected  Poulin to  see the\n\ntruck, he  apparently did  not.   Poulin neither swerved  nor\n\nbraked as he plowed  head on into the flatbed full  of straw.\n\nHe suffered serious injuries.\n\n          Plaintiffs  commenced  this  diversity   action  in\n\nUnited  States  District Court  for  the  District of  Maine.\n\nAfter  the  jury returned  a  verdict  in defendants'  favor,\n\nplaintiffs appealed.\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\n\n          Plaintiffs seek  a new  trial on the  grounds that:\n\n(1) the district court erroneously  instructed the jury as to\n\nGreer's  duties as a truck  driver and erred  by declining to\n\ngive a  missing witness  instruction; (2) the  district court\n\nabused its discretion by refusing to exclude the testimony of\n\nCarol Ricci  as a sanction for  defendants' alleged discovery\n\nviolation; and  (3) the district court  abused its discretion\n\nin  denying  plaintiffs' motion  to  compel  production of  a\n\nphotograph  of the  accident scene  taken one year  after the\n\naccident by a consultant retained by defendants.\n\n1. The Jury Instructions\r            1. The Jury Instructions\r                                    \n\n          Plaintiffs   contend   that   the  district   court\n\ncommitted reversible  error by  failing to instruct  the jury\n\nthat,  under Maine's  comparative negligence  statute, \"[t]he\n\nfactfinder  must  be  told  [that]  .  .  .  it  should  give\n\nconsideration   to  the   relative  blameworthiness   of  the\n\ncausative fault of the claimant and the  defendant,\" and that\n\n\"[d]eliberate disregard  of safety rules must  be judged more\n\nseverely than merely imperfect  reaction to a crisis.\"   Wing\r                                                                         \n\nv.  Morse, 300 A.2d  491, 500 (Me. 1973).   Because there was\r                     \n\nevidence that  Greer had  violated various state  and federal\n\nsafety regulations, plaintiffs claim that the jury could have\n\nfound  that Greer had  deliberately disregarded safety rules,\n\nand that, therefore, his conduct should have been judged more\n\nseverely than Poulin's.\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\n\n          Plaintiffs also maintain  that the court's  failure\n\nto instruct the jury as to two federal safety regulations was\n\nerror.   Specifically, plaintiffs maintain  that the district\n\ncourt should have  instructed the jury  (1) that Greer  could\n\nlawfully drive  his tractor-trailer only if  he was satisfied\n\nthat  he had  three emergency  reflective triangles  with him\n\nready  for  use,  see  49 C.F.R.      392.8,  393.95(f)(2)(i)\r                                 \n\n(1992);  and (2) that if  Greer's attempt to  turn around had\n\ncaused property damage of any kind, he had a duty to take all\n\nnecessary precaution  to prevent additional  accidents at the\n\nscene.  See 49 C.F.R.   392.40 (1992).\r                       \n\n          Finally, plaintiffs argue  that the court's failure\n\nto give a missing  witness instruction constituted reversible\n\nerror.  The court declined to instruct the jury that it could\n\ndraw  an adverse inference from  the fact that  Greer did not\n\ntestify at trial.   Greer lived beyond the subpoena  power of\n\nthe court, and chose not to attend the trial.  His deposition\n\ntestimony was entered into evidence.\n\n          In response, defendants contend that the failure to\n\ngive  plaintiffs' requested  instructions was  not erroneous,\n\nbut,  in any  event,  plaintiffs waived  their challenges  by\n\nfailing to comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 51.\n\n          Before the  district  court charged  the  jury,  it\n\nreceived proposed  instructions from  the parties and  held a\n\npre-charge conference.  At the conference, the court informed\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\n\nthe parties which portions  of their proposed instructions it\n\nwould read.   Plaintiffs duly stated their objections  to the\n\ncourt's  omission  of  various  portions  of  their  proposed\n\ncharge,  including those  portions at  issue on  this appeal.\n\nAfter the court instructed the jury, the judge called counsel\n\nover to the sidebar and asked:  \"Okay.  First, in addition to\n\nany objections previously  made, do you have an objection you\n\nwish to make as to the general content of the instructions at\n\nthis time?\"  Plaintiffs' counsel replied, \"No.\"\n\n          Rule  51 of  the Federal  Rules of  Civil Procedure\n\nprovides  that, \"[n]o party may assign as error the giving or\n\nfailure  to give  an  instruction unless  that party  objects\n\nthereto  before the jury retires to consider its verdict. . .\n\n.\"   \"We have construed  the Rule's requirement  that a party\n\nmust object `before the jury retires to consider its verdict'\n\nto  mean  that   the  objection  must   be  made  after   the\n\ninstructions are given to the jury.\"   Smith v. Massachusetts\r                                                                         \n\nInst. of  Technology, 877 F.2d 1106 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \n\n493  U.S. 965 (1989); see  Phav v.

Even   if  plaintiffs'  requested\n\ninstructions had been proper,  counsel's failure to object to\n\ntheir  omission after  the charge  constitutes waiver  of the\n\nobjection.  See Smith,  877 F.2d at 1109; Wells  Real Estate,\r                                                                         \n\nInc. v.

The  district court's  post-\n\ncharge indication that the parties' prior objections would be\n\npreserved  is of  no help  to plaintiffs.   \"A  trial court's\n\nstatement  after the charge that  objections made prior to it\n\nwill be saved does not absolve an attorney from following the\n\nstrictures  of  the  rule.    Objections  cannot  be  carried\n\nforward.

The  applicable  version of  Fed.  R. Civ.  P.  26(e), in\neffect prior to December 1, 1993, provides in pertinent part:\n\n          A  party who  has responded to  a request\n          for  discovery with  a response  that was\n          complete when  made is  under no duty  to\n          supplement   the   response  to   include\n          information thereafter acquired, except .\n          .  .  (2) A  party  is  under  a duty  to\n          seasonably  amend a prior response if the\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\n\nalleged  violation, plaintiffs  maintain  that  the  district\n\ncourt  should  have  sanctioned  defendant  by excluding  the\n\ntestimony  of Carol  Ricci,  and that  the  court abused  its\n\ndiscretion by not doing so.\n\n          During discovery, defendants were asked  to provide\n\nplaintiffs with the name  of every witness known to  them who\n\ncould  provide information  about the  accident.   Defendants\n\nwere  also  asked  whether   each  witness  named  \"gave  any\n\nstatement  or account, either oral  or in writing,  of his or\n\nher knowledge of the  alleged occurrence.\"  If a  witness had\n\nmade any  such statement, plaintiffs asked  the defendants to\n\nsupply  the substance  of the  same.   Plaintiffs also  asked\n\ndefendants whether they, or any of their agents, had received\n\nany oral or written statements  from anyone who had knowledge\n\nor  information with  respect  to the  accident,  and if  so,\n\ndefendants were asked to supply the name of the person making\n\nthe  statement and its substance.   In their  answers to both\n\nlines of  inquiry, dated  August 1992, defendants  named only\n\nGreer and Frye.  It is undisputed that at the time defendants\n\nresponded their answers were complete.\n\n                    \r                                \n\n          party obtains information upon  the basis\n          of  which  . . . (B) the party knows that\n          the  response though correct when made is\n          no longer true  and the circumstances are\n          such that a failure to amend the response\n          is in substance a knowing concealment.\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\n\n          In November 1992, after speaking  with Ray Ketchen,\n\nthe  owner of  Ray's Country  Store, defendants  learned that\n\nLyon might have  some information about the  accident.  Carol\n\nRicci,  a paralegal,  contacted Lyon  by telephone  and spoke\n\nbriefly with  him.  According  to Ricci's notes,  Lyon stated\n\n\"that [the] truck was  easy to see\" because of its  \"light on\n\ntop\" and \"running lights,\" and that \"I seen it real easy when\n\nI  came  up  to it  in  [the]  road.\"    Defendants  did  not\n\nsupplement  their answers  to plaintiffs'  interrogatories to\n\ninclude Lyon and his statement.  It   is   unclear    whether\n\nplaintiffs  had spoken  with Lyon  prior to  his conversation\n\nwith   Ricci.     Shortly  thereafter,   however,   Lyon  was\n\ninterviewed  by plaintiffs  and informed  them he  had spoken\n\nwith  Ricci.    Defendants  quickly learned  that  Lyon  told\n\nplaintiffs that he  had spoken with  Ricci.  By the  time the\n\ntrial commenced in May 1993, plaintiffs' counsel had met with\n\nand interviewed Lyon on at least three separate occasions.  \n\n          At trial, Lyon testified  that, although he saw the\n\nyellow revolving beacon from  a distance, the trailer  of the\n\ntruck, which  was blocking the road, was not easy to see.  In\n\nfact, Lyon testified that  he did not see the  truck until he\n\nwas right on top  of it.5  On cross-examination,  Lyon denied\n\nthat he told Ricci that the truck was \"easy to see.\"\n\n                    \r                                \n\n5.  On  cross-examination  Lyon  explained  that  this  meant\napproximately seventy-five feet away.\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\n\n          Defendants  sought  to  have  Ricci  testify  as  a\n\n\"rebuttal\" witness.  Plaintiffs objected to  Ricci testifying\n\nbecause she  was not listed on  defendants' pre-trial witness\n\nlist, and  because defendants  had violated their  duty under\n\nRule    26(e)(2)(B)   to   supplement    their   answers   to\n\ninterrogatories.   The court rejected  plaintiffs' arguments,\n\nand allowed Ricci to testify.\n\n          Defendants  argue that their  failure to supplement\n\nwas  not a violation of Rule 26(e)(2)(B) because there was no\n\n\"knowing  concealment\"  on  their   part.    They  knew  that\n\nplaintiffs  had spoken  with  Lyon, and  that plaintiffs  had\n\nascertained  that  Lyon had  spoken  to  Ricci.   Defendants,\n\ntherefore, assumed  that Lyon communicated to  plaintiffs the\n\nsame thing  that he  told Ricci.   Under  these circumstances\n\ndefendants maintain that there was no \"knowing concealment.\"\n\n          In reviewing  a trial  court's ruling on  whether a\n\ndiscovery-related rule was violated, the abuse of  discretion\n\nstandard  controls.

The court\n\naccepted defendants' contention  that they were  surprised by\n\nLyon's  trial  testimony,  and that  they  reasonably thought\n\nplaintiffs  knew  about  the   change  which  rendered  their\n\ninterrogatory  answers  inaccurate.    The   record  supports\n\ndefendants' contention that the  concealment in this case was\n\nnot \"knowing.\"\n\n          Assuming,  arguendo,  that  defendants' failure  to\r                                         \n\nsupplement  did  constitute a  discovery  rule violation,  we\n\nstill  do  not think  that  the district  court's  refusal to\n\npreclude Ricci's  testimony warrants  a new trial.

Plaintiffs argue only that\r                                           \n\nthe district  court should have  precluded Ricci's  testimony\n\nbecause Lyon was a \"key witness.\"   A trial court's choice of\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\n\nsanction for such a discovery violation is reviewed for abuse\n\nof discretion.

Id.

Id.\r                                    \n\n          Although plaintiffs might  have been surprised upon\n\nlearning of the content  of Lyon's statement to Ricci,  it is\n\ndifficult  to discern any  prejudice arising from defendants'\n\nbelated  disclosure  of  the  same.    Lyon's  testimony  was\n\nimportant to plaintiffs' case because of the time at which he\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\n\nsaw  Greer's  truck, not  because he  was  unable to  see the\n\ntrailer  clearly  from  a  distance.    Plaintiffs'  position\n\nthroughout  the trial  was that,  although Greer's  truck had\n\nbeen disabled  for approximately twenty minutes  prior to the\n\naccident, he never placed  his reflective triangles along the\n\nhighway to alert oncoming vehicles of potential danger.  Lyon\n\nwas the only  witness who  could place Greer's  truck at  the\n\nscene  twenty  minutes  prior  to   the  crash.    In   fact,\n\nplaintiffs' counsel, in arguing for the preclusion of Ricci's\n\ntestimony, stated that, \"[w]hat's  important with Mr. Lyon is\n\nthe time, not whether he could see the trailer.\"\n\n          Furthermore,  Lyon was  travelling  north on  Route\n\n191, whereas Poulin was  travelling south.  Therefore, Lyon's\n\ntestimony on  the issue  of the  trailer's visibility  was of\n\nlimited probative value.   In fact, the issue of  the truck's\n\nvisibility from the standpoint of a southbound driver was the\n\nsubject of extensive expert  testimony offered by both sides.\n\nFinally, plaintiffs never requested a recess prior to Ricci's\n\ntestimony  in order to counter its alleged force.  See Smith,\r                                                                        \n\n877 F.2d  at 1111  (\"`Courts have looked  with disfavor  upon\n\nparties who claim surprise  and prejudice but who do  not ask\n\nfor a recess so that they may attempt to counter the opponent\n\ntestimony.'\" (quoting Johnson, 775 F.2d at 7)).\r                                         \n\n          Thus,  even if  defendants  did commit  a discovery\n\nviolation, the district court could reasonably determine that\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\n\nplaintiffs  did  not   suffer  any   prejudice,  and,   given\n\ndefendants'  plausible  explanation  for  their   failure  to\n\nsupplement, that any violation was not willful.  The district\n\ncourt  did  not,  therefore,  abuse its  discretion  when  it\n\ndeclined  to  sanction  any discovery  violation  and allowed\n\nRicci's testimony.  See, e.g., Prentiss &amp; Carlisle,  972 F.2d\r                                                              \n\nat 9 (absent  prejudice to plaintiff  district court did  not\n\nabuse  its  discretion by  refusing  to  preclude testimony);\n\nJackson, 950 F.2d  at 469  (preclusion is a  grave step,  and\r                   \n\n\"`by  no means an automatic  response . .  . where failure to\n\nmake discovery [is] not willful'\" (quoting Freeman v.

In the pre-dawn of a late summer day in Maine, plaintiff-appellant<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Gerald Poulin sustained serious injuries after driving his truck into the flatbed of a tractor-trailer which was blocking the road.  Subsequently, Poulin sued the tractor-trailer's driver, Alexander Greer, and its owner, McConnell Transport, Ltd.  A jury found defendants not liable on the ground that Greer's negligence was not the proximate cause of Poulin's injuries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We affirm.I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was a clear, dry morning on September 11, 1990.  Sometime before 5:00 a.m., while it was still dark, Greer was travelling south along Route 191 in Maine, hauling a load of baled straw.  Having missed his turn-off, Greer attempted to turn around in the driveway of Ray's Country Store which was located off the west side of the road.  While Greer was executing this maneuver, the rear wheels of his tractor became stuck in a drainage ditch off the east side of the road.  The tractor of Greer's truck had turned around and faced north;  the flatbed or trailer portion of the truck sat at a forty-five degree angle across the road, blocking both lanes of traffic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greer turned on the yellow revolving beacon atop the tractor, as well as its hazard lights.  The truck's headlights were on low beam, facing oncoming, i.e., southbound, traffic.  Although Greer testified that he had reflective triangles in the truck, he never placed them on the road as a warning to approaching traffic.  The trailer had a reflector on both sides of its base and on each back corner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 4:40 a.m., Horace \"Denny\" Lyon arrived at the scene.  Lyon was travelling north on Route 191 when he saw the yellow revolving beacon of Greer's truck from about 200 yards away.  Initially Lyon thought that a \"wrecker\" was towing a disabled car off the road.  He slowed down as he approached.  Once Lyon was within seventy-five feet of the truck, he realized that there was a flatbed trailer loaded with straw blocking the road.  He pulled into the driveway at Ray's, stopped his vehicle, and spoke briefly with Greer.  After promising to call the police, Lyon went on his way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before 5:00 a.m., another driver encountered the jackknifed truck.  Ricky Frye was travelling north on Route 191 when he saw a large black silhouette blocking the road about 100 yards in front of him.  Before pulling into the driveway at Ray's, Frye noticed the rear reflectors on Greer's trailer.  After getting out of his truck, Frye noticed that the yellow revolving beacon on Greer's truck and its headlights were both on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crash occurred only minutes after Frye arrived at the scene.  Both he and Greer, who were talking to each other outside of Ray's at the time, saw Poulin's car approaching.  Unlike Lyon and Frye, Poulin was headed south on Route 191.  Although they expected Poulin to see the truck, he apparently did not.  Poulin neither swerved nor braked as he plowed head on into the flatbed full of straw.  He suffered serious injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs commenced this diversity action in United States District Court for the District of Maine.  After the jury returned a verdict in defendants' favor, plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs seek a new trial on the grounds that:  (1) the district court erroneously instructed the jury as to Greer's duties as a truck driver and erred by declining to give a missing witness instruction;  (2) the district court abused its discretion by refusing to exclude the testimony of Carol Ricci as a sanction for defendants' alleged discovery violation;  and (3) the district court abused its discretion in denying plaintiffs' motion to compel production of a photograph of the accident scene taken one year after the accident by a consultant retained by defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. The Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that the district court committed reversible error by failing to instruct the jury that, under Maine's comparative negligence statute, \"[t]he factfinder must be told [that] ... it should give consideration to the relative blameworthiness of the causative fault of the claimant and the defendant,\" and that \"[d]eliberate disregard of safety rules must be judged more severely than merely imperfect reaction to a crisis.\"  Wing v. Morse, 300 A.2d 491, 500 (Me.1973).  Because there was evidence that Greer had violated various state and federal safety regulations, plaintiffs claim that the jury could have found that Greer had deliberately disregarded safety rules, and that, therefore, his conduct should have been judged more severely than Poulin's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also maintain that the court's failure to instruct the jury as to two federal safety regulations was error.  Specifically, plaintiffs maintain that the district court should have instructed the jury (1) that Greer could lawfully drive his tractor-trailer only if he was satisfied that he had three emergency reflective triangles with him ready for use, see 49 C.F.R. Secs. 392.8, 393.95(f)(2)(i) (1992);  and (2) that if Greer's attempt to turn around had caused property damage of any kind, he had a duty to take all necessary precaution to prevent additional accidents at the scene.  See 49 C.F.R. Sec. 392.40 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs argue that the court's failure to give a missing witness instruction constituted reversible error.  The court declined to instruct the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the fact that Greer did not testify at trial.  Greer lived beyond the subpoena power of the court, and chose not to attend the trial.  His deposition testimony was entered into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, defendants contend that the failure to give plaintiffs' requested instructions was not erroneous, but, in any event, plaintiffs waived their challenges by failing to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the district court charged the jury, it received proposed instructions from the parties and held a pre-charge conference.  At the conference, the court informed the parties which portions of their proposed instructions it would read.  Plaintiffs duly stated their objections to the court's omission of various portions of their proposed charge, including those portions at issue on this appeal.  After the court instructed the jury, the judge called counsel over to the sidebar and asked:  \"Okay.  First, in addition to any objections previously made, do you have an objection you wish to make as to the general content of the instructions at this time?\"   Plaintiffs' counsel replied, \"No.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that, \"[n]o party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict....\"  \"We have construed the Rule's requirement that a party must object 'before the jury retires to consider its verdict' to mean that the objection must be made after the instructions are given to the jury.\"  Smith v. Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, 877 F.2d 1106 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 965, 110 S.Ct. 406, 107 L.Ed.2d 372 (1989);  see Phav v. Trueblood, Inc., 915 F.2d 764, 769 (1st Cir.1990);  McGrath v. Spirito, 733 F.2d 967, 968 (1st Cir.1984).  Even if plaintiffs' requested instructions had been proper, counsel's failure to object to their omission after the charge constitutes waiver of the objection.  See Smith, 877 F.2d at 1109;  Wells Real Estate, Inc. v. Greater Lowell Bd. of Realtors, 850 F.2d 803, 809 (1st Cir.)  (collecting cases), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 955, 109 S.Ct. 392, 102 L.Ed.2d 381 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record here is clear:  no objection was made by plaintiffs after the charge.  The district court's post-charge indication that the parties' prior objections would be preserved is of no help to plaintiffs.  \"A trial court's statement after the charge that objections made prior to it will be saved does not absolve an attorney from following the strictures of the rule.  Objections cannot be carried forward.  The rule is binding on both the court and attorneys and neither can circumvent it.\"  McGrath, 733 F.2d at 969;  see Elgabri v. Lekas, 964 F.2d 1255, 1259 (1st Cir.1992) (\"It is the obligation of trial counsel, as well as the trial court, to comply with the strict requirements of the Rule.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of plaintiffs' failure to comply with Rule 51, we review the trial court's instructions only for plain error.  The \"plain error\" rule \" 'should be applied sparingly and only in exceptional cases or under peculiar circumstances to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice.' \"  Wells Real Estate, 850 F.2d at 809 (quoting Nimrod v. Sylvester, 369 F.2d 870, 873 (1st Cir.1966));  see Elgabri, 964 F.2d at 1259.   Under the \"plain error\" exception, an erroneous instruction warrants a new trial only where the error \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\"   See Lash v. Cutts, 943 F.2d 147, 152 (1st Cir.1991);  Smith, 877 F.2d at 1110.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record reveals nothing exceptional about this case.  It is evident that no \"clear miscarriage of justice\" has occurred, and therefore no \"plain error\" exists.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>2. Refusal to Preclude The Testimony of Carol Ricci</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that defendants violated their duty to supplement answers to plaintiffs' interrogatories pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(e)(2)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Because of this alleged violation, plaintiffs maintain that the district court should have sanctioned defendant by excluding the testimony of Carol Ricci, and that the court abused its discretion by not doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During discovery, defendants were asked to provide plaintiffs with the name of every witness known to them who could provide information about the accident.  Defendants were also asked whether each witness named \"gave any statement or account, either oral or in writing, of his or her knowledge of the alleged occurrence.\"   If a witness had made any such statement, plaintiffs asked the defendants to supply the substance of the same.  Plaintiffs also asked defendants whether they, or any of their agents, had received any oral or written statements from anyone who had knowledge or information with respect to the accident, and if so, defendants were asked to supply the name of the person making the statement and its substance.  In their answers to both lines of inquiry, dated August 1992, defendants named only Greer and Frye.  It is undisputed that at the time defendants responded their answers were complete.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1992, after speaking with Ray Ketchen, the owner of Ray's Country Store, defendants learned that Lyon might have some information about the accident.  Carol Ricci, a paralegal, contacted Lyon by telephone and spoke briefly with him.  According to Ricci's notes, Lyon stated \"that [the] truck was easy to see\" because of its \"light on top\" and \"running lights,\" and that \"I seen it real easy when I came up to it in [the] road.\"   Defendants did not supplement their answers to plaintiffs' interrogatories to include Lyon and his statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear whether plaintiffs had spoken with Lyon prior to his conversation with Ricci.  Shortly thereafter, however, Lyon was interviewed by plaintiffs and informed them he had spoken with Ricci.  Defendants quickly learned that Lyon told plaintiffs that he had spoken with Ricci.  By the time the trial commenced in May 1993, plaintiffs' counsel had met with and interviewed Lyon on at least three separate occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Lyon testified that, although he saw the yellow revolving beacon from a distance, the trailer of the truck, which was blocking the road, was not easy to see.  In fact, Lyon testified that he did not see the truck until he was right on top of it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  On cross-examination, Lyon denied that he told Ricci that the truck was \"easy to see.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants sought to have Ricci testify as a \"rebuttal\" witness.  Plaintiffs objected to Ricci testifying because she was not listed on defendants' pre-trial witness list, and because defendants had violated their duty under Rule 26(e)(2)(B) to supplement their answers to interrogatories.  The court rejected plaintiffs' arguments, and allowed Ricci to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that their failure to supplement was not a violation of Rule 26(e)(2)(B) because there was no \"knowing concealment\" on their part.  They knew that plaintiffs had spoken with Lyon, and that plaintiffs had ascertained that Lyon had spoken to Ricci.  Defendants, therefore, assumed that Lyon communicated to plaintiffs the same thing that he told Ricci.  Under these circumstances defendants maintain that there was no \"knowing concealment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a trial court's ruling on whether a discovery-related rule was violated, the abuse of discretion standard controls.  See Thibeault v. Square D. Co., 960 F.2d 239, 243 (1st Cir.1992);  In re San Juan Dupont Hotel Fire Litigation, 859 F.2d 1007, 1019 (1st Cir.1988).  \"The knowing-concealment clause does not require fraudulent intent;  rather it is designed to protect a party who reasonably believes 'that the change that has made [an] answer no longer accurate is known to [the party's] opponent or that it is a matter of no importance.' \"  Fusco v. General Motors Corp., 11 F.3d 259, 265 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Fortino v. Quasar Co., 950 F.2d 389, 396 (7th Cir.1991)).  Moreover, \"[w]e have read Rule 26(e) generously, in light of its dual purposes, the 'narrowing of issues and elimination of surprise.' \"  Id. (quoting Johnson v. H.K. Webster, Inc., 775 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1985)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing defendants' actions in the context in which they arose, we do not believe that the district court abused its discretion by not finding a Rule 26 violation.  The court accepted defendants' contention that they were surprised by Lyon's trial testimony, and that they reasonably thought plaintiffs knew about the change which rendered their interrogatory answers inaccurate.  The record supports defendants' contention that the concealment in this case was not \"knowing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming, arguendo, that defendants' failure to supplement did constitute a discovery rule violation, we still do not think that the district court's refusal to preclude Ricci's testimony warrants a new trial.  Although plaintiffs argue that a trial court may preclude testimony as a sanction, they fail to explain why preclusion was a necessary sanction in this case.   Plaintiffs argue only that the district court should have precluded Ricci's testimony because Lyon was a \"key witness.\"   A trial court's choice of sanction for such a discovery violation is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  See Prentiss &amp; Carlisle v. Koehring-Waterous, 972 F.2d 6, 9 (1st Cir.1992);  Jackson v. Harvard Univ., 900 F.2d 464, 469 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 848, 111 S.Ct. 137, 112 L.Ed.2d 104 (1990).  This standard of review presupposes that the district court possesses a wide latitude in formulating the appropriate sanction, if any, for a discovery violation.  See Jackson, 900 F.2d at 469 (\"appellate inquiry is limited to whether the trial court's chosen course of action came 'safely within the universe of suitable' alternatives\" (quoting Fashion House, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1082 (1st Cir.1989))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court confronted with a violation of Rule 26(e) may choose from a variety of sanctions.  See Thibeault, 960 F.2d at 245.   Although preclusion is one of the sanctions available, the court is empowered to take whatever action it deems appropriate after considering all of the circumstances surrounding the violation.  Id.  The presence of surprise and prejudice play a central role in our review of a district court's decision to preclude or not to preclude testimony.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although plaintiffs might have been surprised upon learning of the content of Lyon's statement to Ricci, it is difficult to discern any prejudice arising from defendants' belated disclosure of the same.  Lyon's testimony was important to plaintiffs' case because of the time at which he saw Greer's truck, not because he was unable to see the trailer clearly from a distance.  Plaintiffs' position throughout the trial was that, although Greer's truck had been disabled for approximately twenty minutes prior to the accident, he never placed his reflective triangles along the highway to alert oncoming vehicles of potential danger.  Lyon was the only witness who could place Greer's truck at the scene twenty minutes prior to the crash.  In fact, plaintiffs' counsel, in arguing for the preclusion of Ricci's testimony, stated that, \"[w]hat's important with Mr. Lyon is the time, not whether he could see the trailer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Lyon was travelling north on Route 191, whereas Poulin was travelling south.  Therefore, Lyon's testimony on the issue of the trailer's visibility was of limited probative value.  In fact, the issue of the truck's visibility from the standpoint of a southbound driver was the subject of extensive expert testimony offered by both sides.  Finally, plaintiffs never requested a recess prior to Ricci's testimony in order to counter its alleged force.  See Smith, 877 F.2d at 1111 (\" 'Courts have looked with disfavor upon parties who claim surprise and prejudice but who do not ask for a recess so that they may attempt to counter the opponent testimony.' \"  (quoting Johnson, 775 F.2d at 7)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, even if defendants did commit a discovery violation, the district court could reasonably determine that plaintiffs did not suffer any prejudice, and, given defendants' plausible explanation for their failure to supplement, that any violation was not willful.  The district court did not, therefore, abuse its discretion when it declined to sanction any discovery violation and allowed Ricci's testimony.  See, e.g. Prentiss &amp; Carlisle, 972 F.2d at 9 (absent prejudice to plaintiff district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to preclude testimony);  Jackson, 900 F.2d at 469 (preclusion is a grave step, and \" 'by no means an automatic response ... where failure to make discovery [is] not willful' \" (quoting Freeman v. Package Machinery Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1341 (1st Cir.1988))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Production of the Photographs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of discovery, plaintiffs moved to compel the production of photographs depicting a recreation of the accident scene taken exactly one year after the crash by a transportation consultant named Murray Segal.  The district court denied the motion, and found, inter alia:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>1.  Murray D.

The photographs Plaintiffs seek to have produced were taken by Murray D. Segal.  They depict the actual truck and load involved in the accident which is the subject of this action.  However, they were taken one year after the accident.  They are not irreplaceable photographs of the actual scene of the accident;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>4.  Plaintiffs have not shown that they could not have substantially duplicated the photographs themselves using a similar truck and load, nor have they shown any attempt to recreate the accident scene using the truck and load which were involved in the accident at any time during the pendency of this litigation;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to denying plaintiffs' motion, the court prohibited defendants from introducing any evidence or testimony related to the photographs.  Rule 26(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in relevant part that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>a party may obtain discovery of documents and tangible things otherwise discoverable ... and prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party['s attorney] ... only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the party's case and that the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3).  On appeal plaintiffs concede that the photographs constitute work product, but maintain that they demonstrated the requisite substantial need and inability to obtain substantially equivalent photographs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District courts have broad discretionary powers to manage cases and, concomitantly, to manage pretrial discovery.  See Maynard v. CIA, 986 F.2d 547, 567 (1st Cir.1993);  see also Thibeault, 960 F.2d at 242;  San Juan Dupont Hotel Fire Litigation, 859 F.2d at 1019.   Appellate intervention in such matters is warranted, \" 'only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.' \"  Maynard, 986 F.2d at 567 (quoting Mack v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 186 (1st Cir.1989)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no \"manifest injustice\" in the district court's order denying plaintiffs' motion to compel production of the Segal photographs.  As the court lucidly explained, plaintiffs could have hired a similar truck and conducted a \"recreation\" comparable to the one commissioned by defendants.  Any photographs taken at plaintiffs' staging of the accident scene would have provided satisfactory alternatives to defendants' photographs.  But, plaintiffs never sought to obtain such photographs, and it appears that their failure to do so was a result of their own inaction.  Finally, we fail to see how plaintiffs were prejudiced by the court's refusal to order production of photographs that it prohibited the defendants from introducing in evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our examination of the pertinent facts reveals no error let alone an abuse of discretion in the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> More precisely, plaintiff-appellants in this action are Poulin, who seeks damages for his personal injuries, and his wife Brenda, who seeks damages for loss of consortium</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although the special interrogatories submitted to the jury instructed the jury to stop answering questions if it found that Greer's negligence was not the proximate cause of Poulin's injuries, the jury ignored this directive and went on to find that Poulin's negligence was the proximate cause of his injuries, and that Poulin's negligence was equal to or greater than Greer's.  Under Maine law, the latter finding would have been sufficient to defeat plaintiffs' claim.  See Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 14, Sec. 156 (West 1980) (\"If such claimant is found by the jury to be equally at fault, the claimant shall not recover.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In fact, we doubt if there was any error at all in the trial court's instructions.

Computer Indentics Corp. v. Southern Pacific Co., 756 F.2d 200, 205 (1st Cir.1985).

In the present case the district court's instructions clearly and concisely explained the applicable law to the jury, while avoiding the repetitiveness of plaintiffs' proffered charge.  Furthermore, we do not believe that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to give a missing witness instruction.   See United States v.

In the pre-dawn of a late summer day in Maine, plaintiff-appellant<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Gerald Poulin sustained serious injuries after driving his truck into the flatbed of a tractor-trailer which was blocking the road.  Subsequently, Poulin sued the tractor-trailer's driver, Alexander Greer, and its owner, McConnell Transport, Ltd.  A jury found defendants not liable on the ground that Greer's negligence was not the proximate cause of Poulin's injuries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We affirm.I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was a clear, dry morning on September 11, 1990.  Sometime before 5:00 a.m., while it was still dark, Greer was travelling south along Route 191 in Maine, hauling a load of baled straw.  Having missed his turn-off, Greer attempted to turn around in the driveway of Ray's Country Store which was located off the west side of the road.  While Greer was executing this maneuver, the rear wheels of his tractor became stuck in a drainage ditch off the east side of the road.  The tractor of Greer's truck had turned around and faced north;  the flatbed or trailer portion of the truck sat at a forty-five degree angle across the road, blocking both lanes of traffic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greer turned on the yellow revolving beacon atop the tractor, as well as its hazard lights.  The truck's headlights were on low beam, facing oncoming, i.e., southbound, traffic.  Although Greer testified that he had reflective triangles in the truck, he never placed them on the road as a warning to approaching traffic.  The trailer had a reflector on both sides of its base and on each back corner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 4:40 a.m., Horace \"Denny\" Lyon arrived at the scene.  Lyon was travelling north on Route 191 when he saw the yellow revolving beacon of Greer's truck from about 200 yards away.  Initially Lyon thought that a \"wrecker\" was towing a disabled car off the road.  He slowed down as he approached.  Once Lyon was within seventy-five feet of the truck, he realized that there was a flatbed trailer loaded with straw blocking the road.  He pulled into the driveway at Ray's, stopped his vehicle, and spoke briefly with Greer.  After promising to call the police, Lyon went on his way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before 5:00 a.m., another driver encountered the jackknifed truck.  Ricky Frye was travelling north on Route 191 when he saw a large black silhouette blocking the road about 100 yards in front of him.  Before pulling into the driveway at Ray's, Frye noticed the rear reflectors on Greer's trailer.  After getting out of his truck, Frye noticed that the yellow revolving beacon on Greer's truck and its headlights were both on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crash occurred only minutes after Frye arrived at the scene.  Both he and Greer, who were talking to each other outside of Ray's at the time, saw Poulin's car approaching.  Unlike Lyon and Frye, Poulin was headed south on Route 191.  Although they expected Poulin to see the truck, he apparently did not.  Poulin neither swerved nor braked as he plowed head on into the flatbed full of straw.  He suffered serious injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs commenced this diversity action in United States District Court for the District of Maine.  After the jury returned a verdict in defendants' favor, plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs seek a new trial on the grounds that:  (1) the district court erroneously instructed the jury as to Greer's duties as a truck driver and erred by declining to give a missing witness instruction;  (2) the district court abused its discretion by refusing to exclude the testimony of Carol Ricci as a sanction for defendants' alleged discovery violation;  and (3) the district court abused its discretion in denying plaintiffs' motion to compel production of a photograph of the accident scene taken one year after the accident by a consultant retained by defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. The Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that the district court committed reversible error by failing to instruct the jury that, under Maine's comparative negligence statute, \"[t]he factfinder must be told [that] ... it should give consideration to the relative blameworthiness of the causative fault of the claimant and the defendant,\" and that \"[d]eliberate disregard of safety rules must be judged more severely than merely imperfect reaction to a crisis.\"  Wing v. Morse, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></span>, 500 (Me.1973).  Because there was evidence that Greer had violated various state and federal safety regulations, plaintiffs claim that the jury could have found that Greer had deliberately disregarded safety rules, and that, therefore, his conduct should have been judged more severely than Poulin's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also maintain that the court's failure to instruct the jury as to two federal safety regulations was error.  Specifically, plaintiffs maintain that the district court should have instructed the jury (1) that Greer could lawfully drive his tractor-trailer only if he was satisfied that he had three emergency reflective triangles with him ready for use, see 49 C.F.R. Secs. 392.8, 393.95(f)(2)(i) (1992);  and (2) that if Greer's attempt to turn around had caused property damage of any kind, he had a duty to take all necessary precaution to prevent additional accidents at the scene.  See 49 C.F.R. Sec. 392.40 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs argue that the court's failure to give a missing witness instruction constituted reversible error.  The court declined to instruct the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the fact that Greer did not testify at trial.  Greer lived beyond the subpoena power of the court, and chose not to attend the trial.  His deposition testimony was entered into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, defendants contend that the failure to give plaintiffs' requested instructions was not erroneous, but, in any event, plaintiffs waived their challenges by failing to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the district court charged the jury, it received proposed instructions from the parties and held a pre-charge conference.  At the conference, the court informed the parties which portions of their proposed instructions it would read.  Plaintiffs duly stated their objections to the court's omission of various portions of their proposed charge, including those portions at issue on this appeal.  After the court instructed the jury, the judge called counsel over to the sidebar and asked:  \"Okay.  First, in addition to any objections previously made, do you have an objection you wish to make as to the general content of the instructions at this time?\"   Plaintiffs' counsel replied, \"No.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that, \"[n]o party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict....\"  \"We have construed the Rule's requirement that a party must object 'before the jury retires to consider its verdict' to mean that the objection must be made after the instructions are given to the jury.\"  Smith v.

Defendants were also asked whether each witness named \"gave any statement or account, either oral or in writing, of his or her knowledge of the alleged occurrence.\"   If a witness had made any such statement, plaintiffs asked the defendants to supply the substance of the same.  Plaintiffs also asked defendants whether they, or any of their agents, had received any oral or written statements from anyone who had knowledge or information with respect to the accident, and if so, defendants were asked to supply the name of the person making the statement and its substance.  In their answers to both lines of inquiry, dated August 1992, defendants named only Greer and Frye.  It is undisputed that at the time defendants responded their answers were complete.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1992, after speaking with Ray Ketchen, the owner of Ray's Country Store, defendants learned that Lyon might have some information about the accident.  Carol Ricci, a paralegal, contacted Lyon by telephone and spoke briefly with him.  According to Ricci's notes, Lyon stated \"that [the] truck was easy to see\" because of its \"light on top\" and \"running lights,\" and that \"I seen it real easy when I came up to it in [the] road.\"   Defendants did not supplement their answers to plaintiffs' interrogatories to include Lyon and his statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear whether plaintiffs had spoken with Lyon prior to his conversation with Ricci.  Shortly thereafter, however, Lyon was interviewed by plaintiffs and informed them he had spoken with Ricci.  Defendants quickly learned that Lyon told plaintiffs that he had spoken with Ricci.  By the time the trial commenced in May 1993, plaintiffs' counsel had met with and interviewed Lyon on at least three separate occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Lyon testified that, although he saw the yellow revolving beacon from a distance, the trailer of the truck, which was blocking the road, was not easy to see.  In fact, Lyon testified that he did not see the truck until he was right on top of it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  On cross-examination, Lyon denied that he told Ricci that the truck was \"easy to see.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants sought to have Ricci testify as a \"rebuttal\" witness.  Plaintiffs objected to Ricci testifying because she was not listed on defendants' pre-trial witness list, and because defendants had violated their duty under Rule 26(e)(2)(B) to supplement their answers to interrogatories.  The court rejected plaintiffs' arguments, and allowed Ricci to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that their failure to supplement was not a violation of Rule 26(e)(2)(B) because there was no \"knowing concealment\" on their part.  They knew that plaintiffs had spoken with Lyon, and that plaintiffs had ascertained that Lyon had spoken to Ricci.  Defendants, therefore, assumed that Lyon communicated to plaintiffs the same thing that he told Ricci.

The court accepted defendants' contention that they were surprised by Lyon's trial testimony, and that they reasonably thought plaintiffs knew about the change which rendered their interrogatory answers inaccurate.  The record supports defendants' contention that the concealment in this case was not \"knowing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming, arguendo, that defendants' failure to supplement did constitute a discovery rule violation, we still do not think that the district court's refusal to preclude Ricci's testimony warrants a new trial.  Although plaintiffs argue that a trial court may preclude testimony as a sanction, they fail to explain why preclusion was a necessary sanction in this case.   Plaintiffs argue only that the district court should have precluded Ricci's testimony because Lyon was a \"key witness.\"   A trial court's choice of sanction for such a discovery violation is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  See Prentiss &amp; Carlisle v. Koehring-Waterous, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588168\"><a href=\"/opinion/588168/prentiss-carlisle-company-inc-v-koehring-waterous-division-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1992);  Jackson v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></span> (1990).  This standard of review presupposes that the district court possesses a wide latitude in formulating the appropriate sanction, if any, for a discovery violation.  See Jackson, 900 F.2d at 469 (\"appellate inquiry is limited to whether the trial court's chosen course of action came 'safely within the universe of suitable' alternatives\" (quoting Fashion House, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534521\"><a href=\"/opinion/534521/fashion-house-inc-v-k-mart-corporation-fashion-house-inc-v-k-mart/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1076</span></a></span>, 1082 (1st Cir.1989))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court confronted with a violation of Rule 26(e) may choose from a variety of sanctions.  See Thibeault, 960 F.2d at 245.   Although preclusion is one of the sanctions available, the court is empowered to take whatever action it deems appropriate after considering all of the circumstances surrounding the violation.  Id.  The presence of surprise and prejudice play a central role in our review of a district court's decision to preclude or not to preclude testimony.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although plaintiffs might have been surprised upon learning of the content of Lyon's statement to Ricci, it is difficult to discern any prejudice arising from defendants' belated disclosure of the same.  Lyon's testimony was important to plaintiffs' case because of the time at which he saw Greer's truck, not because he was unable to see the trailer clearly from a distance.  Plaintiffs' position throughout the trial was that, although Greer's truck had been disabled for approximately twenty minutes prior to the accident, he never placed his reflective triangles along the highway to alert oncoming vehicles of potential danger.  Lyon was the only witness who could place Greer's truck at the scene twenty minutes prior to the crash.  In fact, plaintiffs' counsel, in arguing for the preclusion of Ricci's testimony, stated that, \"[w]hat's important with Mr. Lyon is the time, not whether he could see the trailer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Lyon was travelling north on Route 191, whereas Poulin was travelling south.  Therefore, Lyon's testimony on the issue of the trailer's visibility was of limited probative value.  In fact, the issue of the truck's visibility from the standpoint of a southbound driver was the subject of extensive expert testimony offered by both sides.  Finally, plaintiffs never requested a recess prior to Ricci's testimony in order to counter its alleged force.  See Smith, 877 F.2d at 1111 (\" 'Courts have looked with disfavor upon parties who claim surprise and prejudice but who do not ask for a recess so that they may attempt to counter the opponent testimony.' \"  (quoting Johnson, 775 F.2d at 7)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, even if defendants did commit a discovery violation, the district court could reasonably determine that plaintiffs did not suffer any prejudice, and, given defendants' plausible explanation for their failure to supplement, that any violation was not willful.  The district court did not, therefore, abuse its discretion when it declined to sanction any discovery violation and allowed Ricci's testimony.  See, e.g. Prentiss &amp; Carlisle, 972 F.2d at 9 (absent prejudice to plaintiff district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to preclude testimony);  Jackson, 900 F.2d at 469 (preclusion is a grave step, and \" 'by no means an automatic response ... where failure to make discovery [is] not willful' \" (quoting Freeman v. Package Machinery Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"517427\"><a href=\"/opinion/517427/49-fair-emplpraccas-1139-48-empl-prac-dec-p-38456-27-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span>, 1341 (1st Cir.1988))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Production of the Photographs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of discovery, plaintiffs moved to compel the production of photographs depicting a recreation of the accident scene taken exactly one year after the crash by a transportation consultant named Murray Segal.  The district court denied the motion, and found, inter alia:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>1.  Murray D.

The photographs Plaintiffs seek to have produced were taken by Murray D. Segal.  They depict the actual truck and load involved in the accident which is the subject of this action.  However, they were taken one year after the accident.  They are not irreplaceable photographs of the actual scene of the accident;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>4.  Plaintiffs have not shown that they could not have substantially duplicated the photographs themselves using a similar truck and load, nor have they shown any attempt to recreate the accident scene using the truck and load which were involved in the accident at any time during the pendency of this litigation;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to denying plaintiffs' motion, the court prohibited defendants from introducing any evidence or testimony related to the photographs.  Rule 26(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in relevant part that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>a party may obtain discovery of documents and tangible things otherwise discoverable ... and prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party['s attorney] ... only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the party's case and that the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3).  On appeal plaintiffs concede that the photographs constitute work product, but maintain that they demonstrated the requisite substantial need and inability to obtain substantially equivalent photographs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District courts have broad discretionary powers to manage cases and, concomitantly, to manage pretrial discovery.  See Maynard v. CIA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600729\"><a href=\"/opinion/600729/beatrice-maynard-v-central-intelligence-agency-beatrice-maynard-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span>, 567 (1st Cir.1993);  see also Thibeault, 960 F.2d at 242;  San Juan Dupont Hotel Fire Litigation, 859 F.2d at 1019.   Appellate intervention in such matters is warranted, \" 'only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.' \"  Maynard, 986 F.2d at 567 (quoting Mack v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520577\"><a href=\"/opinion/520577/thomasina-mack-v-the-great-atlantic-and-pacific-tea-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 186 (1st Cir.1989)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no \"manifest injustice\" in the district court's order denying plaintiffs' motion to compel production of the Segal photographs.  As the court lucidly explained, plaintiffs could have hired a similar truck and conducted a \"recreation\" comparable to the one commissioned by defendants.  Any photographs taken at plaintiffs' staging of the accident scene would have provided satisfactory alternatives to defendants' photographs.  But, plaintiffs never sought to obtain such photographs, and it appears that their failure to do so was a result of their own inaction.  Finally, we fail to see how plaintiffs were prejudiced by the court's refusal to order production of photographs that it prohibited the defendants from introducing in evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our examination of the pertinent facts reveals no error let alone an abuse of discretion in the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> More precisely, plaintiff-appellants in this action are Poulin, who seeks damages for his personal injuries, and his wife Brenda, who seeks damages for loss of consortium</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although the special interrogatories submitted to the jury instructed the jury to stop answering questions if it found that Greer's negligence was not the proximate cause of Poulin's injuries, the jury ignored this directive and went on to find that Poulin's negligence was the proximate cause of his injuries, and that Poulin's negligence was equal to or greater than Greer's.  Under Maine law, the latter finding would have been sufficient to defeat plaintiffs' claim.  See Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 14, Sec. 156 (West 1980) (\"If such claimant is found by the jury to be equally at fault, the claimant shall not recover.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In fact, we doubt if there was any error at all in the trial court's instructions.  In reviewing a court's decision not to give a particular instruction, our duty is to determine whether the instructions as given tend to confuse or mislead the jury with regard to the applicable principles of law.  Computer Indentics Corp. v. Southern Pacific Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"448998\"><a href=\"/opinion/448998/computer-identics-corporation-v-southern-pacific-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">756</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 205 (1st Cir.1985).  If the judge's instruction properly informs the jury of the applicable law, failure to give the exact instruction requested does not prejudice the objecting party.  Service Merchandise Co. v.

In the present case the district court's instructions clearly and concisely explained the applicable law to the jury, while avoiding the repetitiveness of plaintiffs' proffered charge.  Furthermore, we do not believe that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to give a missing witness instruction.   See United States v.
