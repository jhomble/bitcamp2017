Jones argues  on appeal\n\nthat (1) a UCC-3  release of collateral form is  not a \"security\"\n\nas defined by  pertinent statute and his conviction  on Counts IV\n\nand V should,  therefore, be reversed; (2) the  judge incorrectly\n\ngave a  willful blindness  instruction as  to Jones'  intent; (3)\n\nthere was insufficient evidence to support the verdicts; (4)  the\n\ncourt erroneously denied a motion to sever Jones' trial from that\n\nof his  codefendant, and (5)  the sentence was overly  severe and\n\nwas incorrectly based on Jones' occupation as an attorney.\n\n          We conclude that a UCC-3 release of  collateral form is\n\nnot a  security as  provided for in  the applicable  statute, the\n\nwillful blindness instruction was correctly given, and the denial\n\nof  the motion for  severance was not  an error.   We reverse the\n\nconviction  on  Counts IV  and  V  and the  consecutive  ten-year\n\nsentence imposed for the transportation of forged securities.

Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073,\n                                                 \n\n1078-79  (1st  Cir.),  cert.  denied, 492  U.S.  910  (1989), the\n                                    \n\nfollowing facts  were established  at trial.    During the  early\n\n1970s, defendant Stephen C. Jones, together with his father Allan\n\nand  Jones' codefendant, Robert  Welch, formed a  holding company\n\ncalled  Iyanough  Management,  which over  the  years  acquired a\n\nnumber of hotels, motels, and  other property.  In 1985, Iyanough\n\nManagement  entered  into  a partnership  known  as  Armory Hotel\n\nAssociates  with a group of contractors  and developers in Maine.\n\nThe  purpose of  the partnership  was  to convert  an old  armory\n\nbuilding in Portland, Maine, into  the Portland Regency Inn.  The\n\nrenovations were  financed through a  loan from Patriot  Bank for\n\n$8.2 million, which was secured by a mortgage of the building and\n\na  security  interest  covering   the  furniture,  fixtures,  and\n\nequipment of the hotel.  A further cash infusion into the project\n\nwas obtained from the  Berkshire Saving Bank in the form  of a $2\n\nmillion irrevocable line of credit, which was secured by a second\n\nmortgage on  the building and  a second security interest  in the\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nfurniture,  fixtures, and equipment  of the hotel.   As a part of\n\nthe original mortgage agreement with  the two banks, Armory Hotel\n\nAssociates signed a  UCC-1 form with each  bank.  This form  is a\n\nfinancing statement which certifies that a party holds a security\n\ninterest in  particular property.   The UCC-1  is filed  with the\n\nSecretary of  State's office  so that any  later parties  will be\n\naware that there  is an encumbrance  upon the property.   Each of\n\nthe  mortgage  agreements   with  the  banks  provided   that  no\n\nadditional  encumbrances upon  the collateral could  be incurred,\n\nand  in the  event that  any  part of  the security  was  sold or\n\ntransferred, the entire mortgage debt would be due and payable on\n\ndemand.  As one of  the partners in the Armory Hotel  Associates,\n\nJones signed the notarized mortgage security agreements with both\n\nbanks.\n\n          Beginning  in  1987,   Iyanough  Management  began   to\n\nexperience financial difficulties.  As a measure to generate cash\n\nflow,  a sale  and lease  back  of the  furniture, fixtures,  and\n\nequipment  of the  Portland Regency  Inn  was negotiated  through\n\nbroker David  Mudie.   Mudie was originally  led to  believe that\n\nIyanough Management owned the Portland Regency and its furniture,\n\nfixtures and equipment.   Through a search with  the Secretary of\n\nState's  Office, Mudie  found out  that  Armory Hotel  Associates\n\nactually owned  the hotel and  its contents,  and discovered  the\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nlien on the fixtures, furniture  and equipment.  As a result,  in\n\norder  to complete  the sale  and lease  back, Kansallis  Finance\n\nLtd.,  the group  financing  the  transaction,  required  that  a\n\nrelease of  the security  interests of  Berkshire County  Savings\n\nBank and  Patriot Bank be  perfected through the filing  of UCC-3\n\nforms.   A UCC-3  is a document  which can  be used to  release a\n\nsecurity interest in certain property which has been memorialized\n\nin a UCC-1.1   Welch induced employees of  Iyanough Management to\n\nforge the signatures of the loan officers of the two banks on the\n\nrelease forms.   The two forged documents, purporting  to release\n\nthe  interest of the two banks, were  filed with the Secretary of\n\nState's office in Maine in  August 1987.  Welch also directed  an\n\nemployee to forge the  signature of one of the  Maine partners of\n\nthe Armory  Hotel Associates on  various other forms  required by\n\nKansallis.\n\n          One  of Kansallis' prerequisites for the closing was an\n\nopinion letter from  counsel for Armory Hotel  Associates opining\n\nthat Kansallis was  receiving a  first security  interest in  the\n\ncollateral consisting of the  furniture, fixtures, and equipment.\n\nTwo drafts of  the opinion letter were  sent to Jones at  his law\n\nfirm by the attorney for Kansallis.  The final opinion letter was\n\n                    \n\n     1A UCC-3  can also be  used to  continue, assign or  amend a\nsecurity interest.  When we discuss the document in this case, we\nare referring to its use as a release of a security interest.\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\nreturned  to Kansallis' counsel  on the letterhead  of Jones' law\n\nfirm,  and  was signed  by  John  Aufiero, counsel  for  Iyanough\n\nManagement.   Aufiero testified  at trial that  he was  given the\n\nform by Jones to sign.  David Mudie testified that he  spoke with\n\nJones  several  times  about the  transaction  and  the documents\n\nnecessary to complete  the arrangement.  When the transaction was\n\ncompleted,   the  sum  of   $1,288,533  was  wired   to  Iyanough\n\nManagement's  account.  Approximately $290,000 of the proceeds of\n\nthe loan were  eventually transferred into  an account in  Jones'\n\nname.\n\n          FBI Agent  James Osterrieder interviewed Jones  as part\n\nof  his  investigation  of  the  forged  documents.    During the\n\ninterview, Jones stated  that initially it was his  idea to carry\n\nout  the sale  and lease  back  of the  furniture, fixtures,  and\n\nequipment, in order to generate cash.  Jones stated  that he knew\n\nthat the  banks had  a lien  on the equipment,  but thought  that\n\nthere was a clause in the  closing document which would allow for\n\nthe sale and lease  back.  Jones also told the  agent that he and\n\nWelch  had discussed  the need  for a  UCC-3 release  of interest\n\nbefore the sale and lease back could proceed, but that Welch said\n\nthat he would take  care of the problem.  Jones  admitted that he\n\nhad seen  a draft  of the  opinion letter  which was required  by\n\nKansallis to consummate the sale and lease back deal, and that he\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\narranged to have Aufiero sign the letter because Jones was out of\n\ntown at the time.\n\n          Robert Welch pled  guilty to bank fraud  and interstate\n\ntransportation  of forged securities,  and proceeded to  trial on\n\nthe  conspiracy  charge.    At  trial,  Welch  testified that  he\n\ncompleted the  arrangement for  the sale  and lease back  without\n\ntelling Jones  the  details of  the transaction,  and that  Jones\n\nnever questioned  Welch about the  deal.  Both  defendants argued\n\nthat  Welch,  working alone,  caused  the UCC-3  documents  to be\n\nforged  by Iyanough  Management  employees  and  filed  with  the\n\nSecretary of  State.   Welch was found  guilty of  conspiracy and\n\nJones was found guilty on all counts.\n\n                               II.\n\n                            Discussion\n                                      \n\nA.

In Speidel,\n                                                                \n\nthe Eighth Circuit held that a quitclaim deed is a security.  The\n\ncourt found that  although a quitclaim  deed is  not the type  of\n\nitem  normally considered  as a  security  by the  commercial and\n\nfinancial  community, such an instrument is an express conveyance\n\nof  whatever interest and  title the  grantor has  in a  piece of\n\nproperty.  Although it warrants no specific interest in property,\n\nit does transfer some interest in  property.  Such a deed may  be\n\nused  to  convey  interests  in  land, to  clear  title  to  land\n\nencumbered  by  liens  or  to  transmit full  title  to  land  by\n\nconveying the grantor's entire interest  to any grantee.  After a\n\nquitclaim deed is conveyed, the grantee holds the entire interest\n\nwhich the grantor had owned.\n\n          We are unable  to agree with the district  court that a\n\nUCC-3 is analogous to a quitclaim deed.  Unlike a quitclaim deed,\n\nthe  UCC-3 at issue  in this case  is not effective  by itself to\n\ntransfer or assign a title, right or interest  in or to property.\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\nAt most,  one could  argue that the  UCC-3 transfers  an interest\n\nfrom the secured party back to  the owner of the property.   This\n\nis a much  more constrained purpose than the potential  uses of a\n\nquitclaim deed, and only permits a transfer of a limited interest\n\nto one  particular party, the original owner.  The sole result of\n\nthe filing  of a UCC-3 is  that the owner  of the property  has a\n\ntitle free of  encumbrances and can proceed to  transfer the lien\n\nfree  property to  another party.   In  this case, the  UCC-3 was\n\nmerely one step in the process of transferring an interest in the\n\nfixtures,  furniture, and  equipment to  a  third party,  and was\n\ninsufficient on its own to convey title to the items listed.  \n\n          Furthermore,  a   UCC-3  does  not  contain   the  same\n\nqualities as other  documents which have been  deemed securities.\n\nIn determining whether an instrument is a security,  other courts\n\nhave  examined factors such as  whether the document evidences an\n\nobligation  for the payment  of money or  represents a particular\n\ninterest in  goods or  property and  has  inherent value,  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

Austin, 462 F.2d  724, 736 (10th\n                                       \n\nCir.),  cert. denied,  409  U.S.  1048  (1972); and  whether  the\n                    \n\ndocument purports to be valuable and is sufficient to establish a\n\ngiven right, relationship or property interest.  United States v.\n                                                                 \n\nJohnson, 700 F.2d 163, 175 (5th Cir. 1983).      \n       \n\n          The effect of the forged UCC-3 release here was only to\n\nterminate the security  interest which the two banks  held in the\n\nfixtures, furniture, and  equipment of the Portland  Regency Inn.\n\nBy  itself, a  document of  release  has no  value, and  does not\n\nrepresent a tangible or intangible valuable property right.  Such\n\na form  could not  be sold or  used as  collateral.  It  does not\n\nrepresent  an acknowledgment  of  a debt  owed  or a  contractual\n\nobligation to pay in the future.   The form was valuable only  to\n\nthe Armory Hotel Associates and not to  any third party.  A UCC-3\n\nserves  merely to  terminate and  not to  transfer or  assign any\n\nproperty interest.  \n\n          In addition, we recognize  that when, as in  this case,\n\nthere is ambiguity  in a criminal statute, such  ambiguity should\n\nbe  construed  in favor  of  the  defendant.   United  States  v.\n                                                                 \n\nBorowski, 977 F.2d  27 (1st Cir. 1992).   Because we hold  that a\n        \n\nUCC-3 is not a security as defined for the purposes of  18 U.S.C.\n\n  2314,   Jones'   conviction  on   two   counts  of   interstate\n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\ntransportation of forged securities pursuant to this section must\n\nbe reversed.\n\nB.  Willful Blindness Instruction\n                                 \n\n          Next,   Jones  objects   to  the   \"willful  blindness\"\n\ninstruction given to the jury, arguing that there was no evidence\n\nthat he was  aware that  a crime  was likely in  progress and  no\n\nevidence that he facilitated it.  A willful blindness instruction\n\nis  appropriate when  (1) defendant  claims a lack  of knowledge;\n\n(2) the facts suggest a conscious course of deliberate ignorance,\n\nand   (3)  the  instructions,   taken  as  a   whole,  cannot  be\n\nmisunderstood by a juror as  mandating an inference of knowledge.\n\nUnited States  v. St. Michael's  Credit Union, 880 F.2d  579, 584\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir. 1989).    Here, the first  element is obviously present\n\nsince Jones claims  that he was ignorant of any  wrongdoing.  The\n\nsecond requirement may  be established from the  evidence adduced\n\nat  trial.   Jones, as one  of the partners,  signed the original\n\nmortgage  agreements  with  Patriot  Bank  and  Berkshire  County\n\nSavings   Bank.    By  signing  these  agreements,  he  displayed\n\nknowledge  of the encumbrances placed on the fixtures, furniture,\n\nand equipment of  the Portland Regency Inn.   He also would  have\n\nknown that the  agreements provided that Armory  Hotel Associates\n\ncould  not incur any  additional encumbrances on  the collateral,\n\nand that the  mortgage would become due and payable if any of the\n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n\ncollateral  was sold or transferred.  There was evidence produced\n\nat trial that Jones  and Welch discussed the need  to obtain cash\n\nfor  Iyanough Management, and  the possibility of  obtaining such\n\ncash through a deal with Mudie involving a sale of the furniture,\n\nfixtures, and equipment  of the Portland Regency Inn.   There was\n\nevidence that  Mudie  discussed  the deal  with  Jones  and  that\n\nRodr guez,  the lawyer  for Kansallis,  sent  documents to  Jones\n\nregarding the deal,  including drafts of the opinion  letter.  In\n\nits  final form,  this opinion  letter  represented, among  other\n\nthings,  that the  firm was  acting as  counsel for  Armory Hotel\n\nAssociates  and that  there  were no  other  encumbrances on  the\n\nfurniture, fixtures,  and equipment  so that  Kansallis' security\n\ninterest was perfected.  Furthermore, John Aufiero testified that\n\nJones brought him the opinion  letter on the letterhead of Jones'\n\nlaw firm, and requested that Aufiero sign the document. \n\n          Testimony by the  FBI agent established  that initially\n\nit  was Jones'  idea to arrange  the sale  and lease back  of the\n\nfurniture, fixtures, and equipment.  Jones told the agent that he\n\nwas  aware of  the banks'  liens on  the equipment but  felt that\n\nthere was some  way out of them.  According to Jones, Welch later\n\ntold Jones that  Welch did not think that  the bank would release\n\nthe collateral, but  that Welch would take  care of it.   The day\n\nafter the money came through  from Mudie and Kansallis, there was\n\n                               -13-\n                                13\n\nevidence   that  Jones   personally  received   checks  totalling\n\napproximately $290,000. \n\n          This evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, is sufficient for a  jury to conclude that Jones knew\n\nabout  the deal  with Kansallis and  Mudie, and knew  that such a\n\ndeal would not  be able to  go forward without  a release of  the\n\nprior security interests held by  the two banks in the furniture,\n\nfixtures, and equipment of  the Portland Regency Inn.   Moreover,\n\nthere is sufficient  evidence from which  a jury could  conclude,\n\nthat Jones knew  both (1) that the banks  would not release their\n\ninterests unless their mortgages were  paid in full, and (2) that\n\nthe opinion letter  was an alternative  means of representing  to\n\nKansallis that the property was no longer encumbered by any prior\n\nliens.   Even if, as  Welch testified,  Jones was unaware  of the\n\nactual steps taken by Welch  to release the security interest, we\n\nfind that the  facts established at trial suggest  that this lack\n\nof  knowledge  could have  been  due  to  a conscious  course  of\n\ndeliberate ignorance on the part of Jones.    \n\n          The  jury  instruction  given was  not  likely  to give\n\njurors  the  impression  that  they were  compelled  to  make  an\n\ninference  of  knowledge  on  the  part  of  Jones.    The  judge\n\ninstructed the jury \n\n          [t]hat  in   considering  whether   defendant\n          Stephen   Jones   knowingly   committed   any\n\n                               -14-\n                                14\n\n          offense, you  may infer but  are not required\n          to  infer,  knowledge  on  his  part  from  a\n          combination of suspicion  and indifference to\n          the  truth  if you  find beyond  a reasonable\n          doubt that to have existed on his part. [sic]\n          If you find  that he had a  strong suspicious\n          [sic] that things were  not what they seemed,\n          or that someone  had withheld some  important\n          facts, yet that he shut his eyes for  fear of\n          what he would learn, you may conclude that he\n          acted  knowingly . . . . With  regard to  any\n          such  inference you  must  reason with  care.\n          You may not draw this inference  or knowledge\n          from negligence  or mistake.  I  instruct you\n          that  negligence, even  gross negligence,  is\n          not  a proper basis  to support a  finding of\n          wilfulness,  or  to  support   a  finding  of\n          knowledge, nor is error or mistake . . .  I'm\n          not suggesting one  way or the other  how you\n          should find with  respect to this matter.   I\n          am  not suggesting  that  you  make any  such\n          finding,  or that if you do, what the finding\n          should be.  I'm simply telling you . . . that\n          you may infer  knowledge if you  find willful\n          blindness to a fact to have occurred.\n\nThis  instruction clearly did not mandate  a finding of knowledge\n\non the part of the jury.\n\n          Jones  objects that  the court  failed  to utilize  the\n\ninstructions on  willful blindness  which the defendant  offered,\n\narguing that his wording  \"more properly put such  instruction in\n\nthe  proper  context  for  the  jury.\"   The  failure  to  give a\n\nrequested  jury  instruction  is reversible  error  only  if \"the\n\nrequested   instruction   is  substantially   correct,   was  not\n\nsubstantially covered in the charge actually given, and covers an\n\nimportant point  in  the trial  so that  the failure  to give  it\n\n                               -15-\n                                15\n\nseriously impaired  the defendant's  ability to  present a  given\n\ndefense.\"   United States v.  Nason, No. 92-2303,  slip op. at 11\n                                   \n\n(1st Cir. July 9, 1993) (citing United States v. Newton, 891 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n944,  949 (1st  Cir. 1989)).   Jones'  argument fails  under this\n\ntest.    Although  his  requested  instruction  is  substantially\n\ncorrect, Jones fails to point out in what manner his instructions\n\nwere superior to those given, and a comparison of the two sets of\n\ninstructions shows no material difference in what was conveyed to\n\nthe jury.  There is no suggestion that an important point was not\n\nconveyed by  the given  instructions.  We  find no  error in  the\n\njudge's declining to adopt Jones' suggested instructions. \n\nC.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\n                               \n\n          Jones  argues that there  was insufficient  evidence to\n\nsustain  his conviction.  In  order to successfully challenge the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence on appeal, a defendant must show that\n\nno  reasonable   jury  could  have  found  him  guilty  beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt.  United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 469\n                                              \n\n(1st  Cir. 1993).   On appeal, we  must view the  evidence in the\n\nlight  most favorable to  the government, \"drawing  all plausible\n\ninferences  in   its   favor  and   resolving   all   credibility\n\ndeterminations in line  with the jury's verdict.\"   United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.

We will examine the conspiracy and bank fraud charges in\n\nturn.\n\n     1.  Conspiracy Charge\n                          \n\n          Conviction  of  conspiracy   requires  proof  that  the\n\ndefendant  entered into  an  agreement with  another to  commit a\n\ncrime; the agreement need not be express but may be implicit in a\n\nworking  relationship.    Innamorati,  996  F.2d  at  470.    The\n                                    \n\ngovernment must prove two kinds of  intent:  intent to agree  and\n\nintent to commit the crime.  However,  \"[t]he government need not\n\nprove  that  a   co-conspirator  knew  all  of  the   details  or\n\nparticipated  in all  of the  objectives  of the  plan.\"   United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. G mez-Pab n,  911 F.2d 847, 853 (1st  Cir. 1990), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 498 U.S. 1074 (1991) (citations omitted).\n      \n\n          In order to convict Jones of conspiracy to  commit bank\n\nfraud,3 the prosecution must show  that Jones and Welch agreed to\n\ndefraud  Patriot Bank and  Berkshire County Savings  Bank.  Jones\n\nargues that the fraud perpetrated upon the banks was completed on\n\nJuly 23, 1987,  when the forged  UCC-3 forms were filed  with the\n\nMaine Secretary  of  State, and  that  the only  direct  evidence\n\nconnecting  Jones  to  any fraudulent  activity  was  the opinion\n\n                    \n\n     3Our  disposition of this appeal renders moot any discussion\nof  the part  of the  charge for  conspiracy to  transport forged\nsecurities in interstate commerce.  For that reason, we limit the\nanalysis  to the  sufficiency  of the  charge  for conspiracy  to\ncommit bank fraud.\n\n                               -17-\n                                17\n\nletter dated August  10, 1987.  This claim,  however, ignores the\n\nevidence that  Jones knew about  the possibility of the  sale and\n\nlease back  arrangement, and  discussed  with Welch  the need  to\n\nobtain releases  from the two  banks.  From this,  the jury could\n\nhave inferred  that even if  Jones did not have  actual knowledge\n\nthat Welch was forging the UCC-3 forms,  he knew that there was a\n\nneed to obtain  a release from the  banks, he was aware  that the\n\nbank would not  allow such a release unless the mortgage was paid\n\nin full, and he  knew that somehow Welch was going  to \"take care\n\nof it.\"  Based on this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude\n\nthat even if there was  no express agreement, Jones sat passively\n\nby  and let his  partner proceed  with the  sale and  lease back,\n\nknowing that the  transaction could not be  completed legally and\n\nwould effect a fraud on the new lender.  \n\n     2.  Bank Fraud Charges\n                           \n\n          In order to convict Jones of bank fraud under 18 U.S.C.\n\n  1344(1), the  jury had to  find beyond a reasonable  doubt that\n\nJones \"engaged  in or attempted to engage  in a pattern or course\n\nof conduct designed  to deceive a federally chartered  or insured\n\nfinancial institution into releasing property, with the intent to\n\nvictimize the  institution by exposing it to  actual or potential\n\nloss.\"  United States  v. Ragosta, 970 F.2d 1085, 1089 (2d Cir.),\n                                 \n\ncert.  denied,       U.S.       (1992) (quoting  United States v.\n                                                                 \n\n                               -18-\n                                18\n\nStavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 694 (2d Cir. 1992)).   The element of\n            \n\nintent can  be established  through  circumstantial evidence  and\n\ninferences drawn from evidence presented at trial.  Id. at 1090.\n                                                       \n\n          The  same evidence which serves to sustain a conviction\n\nfor conspiracy to commit bank fraud will suffice to affirm Jones'\n\nconviction  for  bank  fraud under  a  willful  blindness theory.\n\nJones knew that a sale and lease back of the furniture, fixtures,\n\nand equipment was being planned.  He knew that Kansallis required\n\na release of  the banks' interest and  that such a release  would\n\nnot  be granted unless  the mortgage was  paid off.   Even if, as\n\nWelch testified, Jones never found out about the forgery and just\n\ntrusted  Welch  to  work  out  a deal  which  would  provide  the\n\ndesperately needed  cash, a  rational jury  could have  concluded\n\nthat  Jones deliberately  shut  his eyes  to what  was occurring.\n\n\"The  purpose  of the  willful  blindness  theory  is  to  impose\n\ncriminal liability on  people who, recognizing the  likelihood of\n\nwrongdoing,  nonetheless   consciously  refuse   to  take   basic\n\ninvestigatory steps.\"  United  States v. Rothrock, 806  F.2d 318,\n                                                 \n\n323  (1st  Cir. 1986).    The  evidence  presented at  trial  was\n\nsufficient for a conviction on the counts of bank fraud.\n\nD.  Motion to Sever\n                   \n\n                               -19-\n                                19\n\n          Jones moved  for severance  of his trial  from that  of\n\ncodefendant Welch under Fed.  R. Crim. P. 14.4   The court denied\n\nhis motion, holding that Jones failed to persuasively demonstrate\n\nthat  he would  incur  prejudice at  trial  as  a result  of  the\n\njoinder.   Jones appeals the denial, arguing that he was a victim\n\nof the prejudicial spillover of evidence against his codefendant,\n\nwho  had already pled  guilty to the  substantive counts charged.\n\nIn addition, Jones  suggests that the jury may have held him to a\n\nhigher standard than Welch since Jones was an attorney.  Finally,\n\nJones argues that the joinder improperly placed him in a position\n\nwhere, in order to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege against\n\nself-incrimination,  he  was  forced to  accept  an  adverse jury\n\ninference.  \n\n          The grant or  denial of a motion for  severance is left\n\nto  the discretion of the trial  court and will only be disturbed\n\nfor an  abuse of that discretion.   United States  v. Porter, 764\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 1985).  For reasons of judicial economy, co-\n\n                    \n\n     4Fed. R. Crim. P. 14 provides in part: \n\n          If  it  appears  that  a   defendant  or  the\n          government  is  prejudiced  by a  joinder  of\n          offenses or of defendants in an indictment or\n          information or  by  such  joinder  for  trial\n          together, the court may order an election  or\n          separate trials of counts,  grant a severance\n          of  defendants  or   provide  whatever  other\n          relief justice requires.\n\n                               -20-\n                                20\n\nconspirators are generally tried together absent a strong showing\n\nof prejudice.  United States v. Perkins, 926 F.2d 1271, 1280 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1991).   In order  to obtain  a severance, a  defendant must\n\nshow  that substantial prejudice,  amounting to a  miscarriage of\n\njustice,  would result  from a  joint  trial.   United States  v.\n                                                                 \n\nSabatino, 943 F.2d  94, 96 (1st Cir.  1991).     Mere speculative\n        \n\nallegations as to possible prejudice from joinder  do not sustain\n\nthe burden of  showing an abuse of discretion in denying a motion\n\nfor severance.  \n\n          Jones  failed to  show that  the  presence of  Welch at\n\ntrial was so  prejudicial as to warrant severance.   Welch argued\n\nat  trial that  there was  no  conspiracy between  Jones and  him\n\nbecause Welch  operated on his  own to perpetrate the  fraud upon\n\nthe  banks  and  the  transportation  of  the  forged  documents.\n\nSeveral times on the stand Welch emphasized that he  was the only\n\none responsible for the criminal  acts.  Such evidence could only\n\nbe helpful  to Jones' claim that  he had no knowledge  of Welch's\n\nactivity.  \n\n          Jones'  claim of a spillover effect is also unavailing.\n\nThe  danger which  is to be  prevented is  that the jury  will be\n\nunable to separate  the evidence against different  defendants or\n\nthat evidence which is admissible against only one defendant will\n\nbe used by the jury  against a co-conspirator.  See Perkins,  926\n                                                           \n\n                               -21-\n                                21\n\nF.2d at 1281.  Usually,  however, any prejudice caused by joinder\n\nis  best  dealt  with  through   instructing  the  jury  to  give\n\nindividual consideration  to each  defendant.   United States  v.\n                                                                 \n\nBruner,  657 F.2d  1278  (D.C. Cir.  1981).   Here,  there is  no\n      \n\nevidence, and  Jones has  not identified any,  that the  jury was\n\nunable  to evaluate separately and  fairly the guilt or innocence\n\nof each  defendant.  The judge instructed  the jury that a guilty\n\nplea by Welch could not  be considered as evidence against Jones,\n\nand  also  noted that  each  defendant should  be  given separate\n\nconsideration.  He informed the  jury that any evidence which was\n\nadmitted solely  against one  defendant could  not be  considered\n\nagainst the other defendant.  \n\n          Jones  argues that  the jury  may  have held  him to  a\n\nhigher standard of conduct than  Welch because he is an attorney.\n\nHowever,  Jones presents no  evidence that his  occupation caused\n\nthe  jury to view  him more harshly.   In any  event, Jones could\n\nhave requested a special jury instruction that attorneys are held\n\nto the same standard  of conduct as others, and failed  to do so.\n\nSee  United States  v. Picciandra,  788 F.2d  39, 46  (1st Cir.),\n                                 \n\ncert. denied, 479 U.S. 847 (1986).\n            \n\n          Finally,  Jones claims that  the joinder, combined with\n\nthe willful blindness instruction, forced  him to risk an adverse\n\ninference  on  the part  of  the  jury  by exercising  his  Fifth\n\n                               -22-\n                                22\n\nAmendment privilege not  to testify.  In Porter,  we rejected the\n                                               \n\nargument  that  the  antagonistic defense  of  a  codefendant was\n\ngrounds  for  severance  of  trial  because  it  would  force the\n\ndefendant to  testify in violation  of the Fifth Amendment.   764\n\nF.2d  at 14.   The  need for  severance  to protect  Jones' Fifth\n\nAmendment rights was even more minimal, since Welch's defense was\n\ncompletely in line  with Jones' claim of innocence.   The joinder\n\nhad no impact on Jones' Fifth  Amendment rights and there was  no\n\nabuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal of the motion to\n\nsever.\n\nE.  Severity of Sentence\n                        \n\n          Jones  objects  to  the   length  of  the  fifteen-year\n\nsentence by the trial court.  He argues that a five-year sentence\n\nwould be appropriate  for a first time offender  such as himself.\n\nBecause  we   reverse  Jones'  conviction   for  the   interstate\n\ntransportation of forged  securities, his sentence is  reduced to\n\nfive years  for conspiracy  to commit bank  fraud and  five years\n\neach for two counts of bank fraud, to be served concurrently.  We\n\nsee no  reason  to  alter  Judge  Carter's  assessment  and  pre-\n\nguideline sentencing  on Counts I,  II, and III.   Therefore, the\n\nsentence on  the remaining  counts will stand  as crafted  by the\n\ntrial judge.  See United  States v. Jim nez-Rivera, 842 F.2d 545,\n                                                  \n\n548 (1st Cir.), cert. denied., 487 U.S. 1223 (1988).\n                            \n\n                               -23-\n                                23\n\n                               III.\n\n                            Conclusion\n                                      \n\n          Because we  hold that a  UCC-3 is not a  \"security\" for\n\nthe purpose of  18 U.S.C.   2314, Jones' conviction  on Counts IV\n\nand  V for the interstate transportation  of forged securities is\n\nreversed.  Sufficient  evidence was adduced  at trial to  convict\nreversed\n        \n\nJones of conspiracy and bank fraud on Counts I, II, and  III, and\n\nthe  trial court  did not  abuse  its discretion  by denying  the\n\nmotion to sever Jones'  trial from that of his codefendant.   For\n\nthese reasons, Jones'  convictions for conspiracy and  bank fraud\n\nare affirmed.  \n    affirmed\n            \n\n                               -24-\n                                24\n",

During the  early\n\n1970s, defendant Stephen C. Jones, together with his father Allan\n\nand  Jones' codefendant, Robert  Welch, formed a  holding company\n\ncalled  Iyanough  Management,  which over  the  years  acquired a\n\nnumber of hotels, motels, and  other property.  In 1985, Iyanough\n\nManagement  entered  into  a partnership  known  as  Armory Hotel\n\nAssociates  with a group of contractors  and developers in Maine.\n\nThe  purpose of  the partnership  was  to convert  an old  armory\n\nbuilding in Portland, Maine, into  the Portland Regency Inn.  The\n\nrenovations were  financed through a  loan from Patriot  Bank for\n\n$8.2 million, which was secured by a mortgage of the building and\n\na  security  interest  covering   the  furniture,  fixtures,  and\n\nequipment of the hotel.  A further cash infusion into the project\n\nwas obtained from the  Berkshire Saving Bank in the form  of a $2\n\nmillion irrevocable line of credit, which was secured by a second\n\nmortgage on  the building and  a second security interest  in the\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\nfurniture,  fixtures, and equipment  of the hotel.   As a part of\n\nthe original mortgage agreement with  the two banks, Armory Hotel\n\nAssociates signed a  UCC-1 form with each  bank.  This form  is a\n\nfinancing statement which certifies that a party holds a security\n\ninterest in  particular property.   The UCC-1  is filed  with the\n\nSecretary of  State's office  so that any  later parties  will be\n\naware that there  is an encumbrance  upon the property.   Each of\n\nthe  mortgage  agreements   with  the  banks  provided   that  no\n\nadditional  encumbrances upon  the collateral could  be incurred,\n\nand  in the  event that  any  part of  the security  was  sold or\n\ntransferred, the entire mortgage debt would be due and payable on\n\ndemand.  As one of  the partners in the Armory Hotel  Associates,\n\nJones signed the notarized mortgage security agreements with both\n\nbanks.\n\n          Beginning  in  1987,   Iyanough  Management  began   to\n\nexperience financial difficulties.  As a measure to generate cash\n\nflow,  a sale  and lease  back  of the  furniture, fixtures,  and\n\nequipment  of the  Portland Regency  Inn  was negotiated  through\n\nbroker David  Mudie.   Mudie was originally  led to  believe that\n\nIyanough Management owned the Portland Regency and its furniture,\n\nfixtures and equipment.   Through a search with  the Secretary of\n\nState's  Office, Mudie  found out  that  Armory Hotel  Associates\n\nactually owned  the hotel and  its contents,  and discovered  the\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nlien on the fixtures, furniture  and equipment.  As a result,  in\n\norder  to complete  the sale  and lease  back, Kansallis  Finance\n\nLtd.,  the group  financing  the  transaction,  required  that  a\n\nrelease of  the security  interests of  Berkshire County  Savings\n\nBank and  Patriot Bank be  perfected through the filing  of UCC-3\n\nforms.   A UCC-3  is a document  which can  be used to  release a\n\nsecurity interest in certain property which has been memorialized\n\nin a UCC-1.1   Welch induced employees of  Iyanough Management to\n\nforge the signatures of the loan officers of the two banks on the\n\nrelease forms.   The two forged documents, purporting  to release\n\nthe  interest of the two banks, were  filed with the Secretary of\n\nState's office in Maine in  August 1987.  Welch also directed  an\n\nemployee to forge the  signature of one of the  Maine partners of\n\nthe Armory  Hotel Associates on  various other forms  required by\n\nKansallis.\n\n          One  of Kansallis' prerequisites for the closing was an\n\nopinion letter from  counsel for Armory Hotel  Associates opining\n\nthat Kansallis was  receiving a  first security  interest in  the\n\ncollateral consisting of the  furniture, fixtures, and equipment.\n\nTwo drafts of  the opinion letter were  sent to Jones at  his law\n\nfirm by the attorney for Kansallis.  The final opinion letter was\n\n                    \n\n     1A UCC-3  can also be  used to  continue, assign or  amend a\nsecurity interest.  When we discuss the document in this case, we\nare referring to its use as a release of a security interest.\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\nreturned  to Kansallis' counsel  on the letterhead  of Jones' law\n\nfirm,  and  was signed  by  John  Aufiero, counsel  for  Iyanough\n\nManagement.   Aufiero testified  at trial that  he was  given the\n\nform by Jones to sign.  David Mudie testified that he  spoke with\n\nJones  several  times  about the  transaction  and  the documents\n\nnecessary to complete  the arrangement.  When the transaction was\n\ncompleted,   the  sum  of   $1,288,533  was  wired   to  Iyanough\n\nManagement's  account.  Approximately $290,000 of the proceeds of\n\nthe loan were  eventually transferred into  an account in  Jones'\n\nname.\n\n          FBI Agent  James Osterrieder interviewed Jones  as part\n\nof  his  investigation  of  the  forged  documents.    During the\n\ninterview, Jones stated  that initially it was his  idea to carry\n\nout  the sale  and lease  back  of the  furniture, fixtures,  and\n\nequipment, in order to generate cash.  Jones stated  that he knew\n\nthat the  banks had  a lien  on the equipment,  but thought  that\n\nthere was a clause in the  closing document which would allow for\n\nthe sale and lease  back.  Jones also told the  agent that he and\n\nWelch  had discussed  the need  for a  UCC-3 release  of interest\n\nbefore the sale and lease back could proceed, but that Welch said\n\nthat he would take  care of the problem.  Jones  admitted that he\n\nhad seen  a draft  of the  opinion letter  which was required  by\n\nKansallis to consummate the sale and lease back deal, and that he\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\narranged to have Aufiero sign the letter because Jones was out of\n\ntown at the time.\n\n          Robert Welch pled  guilty to bank fraud  and interstate\n\ntransportation  of forged securities,  and proceeded to  trial on\n\nthe  conspiracy  charge.    At  trial,  Welch  testified that  he\n\ncompleted the  arrangement for  the sale  and lease back  without\n\ntelling Jones  the  details of  the transaction,  and that  Jones\n\nnever questioned  Welch about the  deal.  Both  defendants argued\n\nthat  Welch,  working alone,  caused  the UCC-3  documents  to be\n\nforged  by Iyanough  Management  employees  and  filed  with  the\n\nSecretary of  State.

In Speidel,\n                                                                \n\nthe Eighth Circuit held that a quitclaim deed is a security.  The\n\ncourt found that  although a quitclaim  deed is  not the type  of\n\nitem  normally considered  as a  security  by the  commercial and\n\nfinancial  community, such an instrument is an express conveyance\n\nof  whatever interest and  title the  grantor has  in a  piece of\n\nproperty.  Although it warrants no specific interest in property,\n\nit does transfer some interest in  property.  Such a deed may  be\n\nused  to  convey  interests  in  land, to  clear  title  to  land\n\nencumbered  by  liens  or  to  transmit full  title  to  land  by\n\nconveying the grantor's entire interest  to any grantee.  After a\n\nquitclaim deed is conveyed, the grantee holds the entire interest\n\nwhich the grantor had owned.\n\n          We are unable  to agree with the district  court that a\n\nUCC-3 is analogous to a quitclaim deed.  Unlike a quitclaim deed,\n\nthe  UCC-3 at issue  in this case  is not effective  by itself to\n\ntransfer or assign a title, right or interest  in or to property.\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\nAt most,  one could  argue that the  UCC-3 transfers  an interest\n\nfrom the secured party back to  the owner of the property.   This\n\nis a much  more constrained purpose than the potential  uses of a\n\nquitclaim deed, and only permits a transfer of a limited interest\n\nto one  particular party, the original owner.  The sole result of\n\nthe filing  of a UCC-3 is  that the owner  of the property  has a\n\ntitle free of  encumbrances and can proceed to  transfer the lien\n\nfree  property to  another party.   In  this case, the  UCC-3 was\n\nmerely one step in the process of transferring an interest in the\n\nfixtures,  furniture, and  equipment to  a  third party,  and was\n\ninsufficient on its own to convey title to the items listed.  \n\n          Furthermore,  a   UCC-3  does  not  contain   the  same\n\nqualities as other  documents which have been  deemed securities.\n\nIn determining whether an instrument is a security,  other courts\n\nhave  examined factors such as  whether the document evidences an\n\nobligation  for the payment  of money or  represents a particular\n\ninterest in  goods or  property and  has  inherent value,  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

Here, the first  element is obviously present\n\nsince Jones claims  that he was ignorant of any  wrongdoing.  The\n\nsecond requirement may  be established from the  evidence adduced\n\nat  trial.   Jones, as one  of the partners,  signed the original\n\nmortgage  agreements  with  Patriot  Bank  and  Berkshire  County\n\nSavings   Bank.    By  signing  these  agreements,  he  displayed\n\nknowledge  of the encumbrances placed on the fixtures, furniture,\n\nand equipment of  the Portland Regency Inn.   He also would  have\n\nknown that the  agreements provided that Armory  Hotel Associates\n\ncould  not incur any  additional encumbrances on  the collateral,\n\nand that the  mortgage would become due and payable if any of the\n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n\ncollateral  was sold or transferred.  There was evidence produced\n\nat trial that Jones  and Welch discussed the need  to obtain cash\n\nfor  Iyanough Management, and  the possibility of  obtaining such\n\ncash through a deal with Mudie involving a sale of the furniture,\n\nfixtures, and equipment  of the Portland Regency Inn.   There was\n\nevidence that  Mudie  discussed  the deal  with  Jones  and  that\n\nRodr guez,  the lawyer  for Kansallis,  sent  documents to  Jones\n\nregarding the deal,  including drafts of the opinion  letter.  In\n\nits  final form,  this opinion  letter  represented, among  other\n\nthings,  that the  firm was  acting as  counsel for  Armory Hotel\n\nAssociates  and that  there  were no  other  encumbrances on  the\n\nfurniture, fixtures,  and equipment  so that  Kansallis' security\n\ninterest was perfected.  Furthermore, John Aufiero testified that\n\nJones brought him the opinion  letter on the letterhead of Jones'\n\nlaw firm, and requested that Aufiero sign the document. \n\n          Testimony by the  FBI agent established  that initially\n\nit  was Jones'  idea to arrange  the sale  and lease back  of the\n\nfurniture, fixtures, and equipment.  Jones told the agent that he\n\nwas  aware of  the banks'  liens on  the equipment but  felt that\n\nthere was some  way out of them.  According to Jones, Welch later\n\ntold Jones that  Welch did not think that  the bank would release\n\nthe collateral, but  that Welch would take  care of it.   The day\n\nafter the money came through  from Mudie and Kansallis, there was\n\n                               -13-\n                                13\n\nevidence   that  Jones   personally  received   checks  totalling\n\napproximately $290,000. \n\n          This evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, is sufficient for a  jury to conclude that Jones knew\n\nabout  the deal  with Kansallis and  Mudie, and knew  that such a\n\ndeal would not  be able to  go forward without  a release of  the\n\nprior security interests held by  the two banks in the furniture,\n\nfixtures, and equipment of  the Portland Regency Inn.   Moreover,\n\nthere is sufficient  evidence from which  a jury could  conclude,\n\nthat Jones knew  both (1) that the banks  would not release their\n\ninterests unless their mortgages were  paid in full, and (2) that\n\nthe opinion letter  was an alternative  means of representing  to\n\nKansallis that the property was no longer encumbered by any prior\n\nliens.   Even if, as  Welch testified,  Jones was unaware  of the\n\nactual steps taken by Welch  to release the security interest, we\n\nfind that the  facts established at trial suggest  that this lack\n\nof  knowledge  could have  been  due  to  a conscious  course  of\n\ndeliberate ignorance on the part of Jones.    \n\n          The  jury  instruction  given was  not  likely  to give\n\njurors  the  impression  that  they were  compelled  to  make  an\n\ninference  of  knowledge  on  the  part  of  Jones.    The  judge\n\ninstructed the jury \n\n          [t]hat  in   considering  whether   defendant\n          Stephen   Jones   knowingly   committed   any\n\n                               -14-\n                                14\n\n          offense, you  may infer but  are not required\n          to  infer,  knowledge  on  his  part  from  a\n          combination of suspicion  and indifference to\n          the  truth  if you  find beyond  a reasonable\n          doubt that to have existed on his part. [sic]\n          If you find  that he had a  strong suspicious\n          [sic] that things were  not what they seemed,\n          or that someone  had withheld some  important\n          facts, yet that he shut his eyes for  fear of\n          what he would learn, you may conclude that he\n          acted  knowingly . . . . With  regard to  any\n          such  inference you  must  reason with  care.\n          You may not draw this inference  or knowledge\n          from negligence  or mistake.  I  instruct you\n          that  negligence, even  gross negligence,  is\n          not  a proper basis  to support a  finding of\n          wilfulness,  or  to  support   a  finding  of\n          knowledge, nor is error or mistake . . .  I'm\n          not suggesting one  way or the other  how you\n          should find with  respect to this matter.   I\n          am  not suggesting  that  you  make any  such\n          finding,  or that if you do, what the finding\n          should be.  I'm simply telling you . . . that\n          you may infer  knowledge if you  find willful\n          blindness to a fact to have occurred.\n\nThis  instruction clearly did not mandate  a finding of knowledge\n\non the part of the jury.\n\n          Jones  objects that  the court  failed  to utilize  the\n\ninstructions on  willful blindness  which the defendant  offered,\n\narguing that his wording  \"more properly put such  instruction in\n\nthe  proper  context  for  the  jury.\"   The  failure  to  give a\n\nrequested  jury  instruction  is reversible  error  only  if \"the\n\nrequested   instruction   is  substantially   correct,   was  not\n\nsubstantially covered in the charge actually given, and covers an\n\nimportant point  in  the trial  so that  the failure  to give  it\n\n                               -15-\n                                15\n\nseriously impaired  the defendant's  ability to  present a  given\n\ndefense.\"   United States v.

Jones'  argument fails  under this\n\ntest.    Although  his  requested  instruction  is  substantially\n\ncorrect, Jones fails to point out in what manner his instructions\n\nwere superior to those given, and a comparison of the two sets of\n\ninstructions shows no material difference in what was conveyed to\n\nthe jury.  There is no suggestion that an important point was not\n\nconveyed by  the given  instructions.  We  find no  error in  the\n\njudge's declining to adopt Jones' suggested instructions. \n\nC.

In  order to successfully challenge the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence on appeal, a defendant must show that\n\nno  reasonable   jury  could  have  found  him  guilty  beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt.

Jones\n\nargues that the fraud perpetrated upon the banks was completed on\n\nJuly 23, 1987,  when the forged  UCC-3 forms were filed  with the\n\nMaine Secretary  of  State, and  that  the only  direct  evidence\n\nconnecting  Jones  to  any fraudulent  activity  was  the opinion\n\n                    \n\n     3Our  disposition of this appeal renders moot any discussion\nof  the part  of the  charge for  conspiracy to  transport forged\nsecurities in interstate commerce.  For that reason, we limit the\nanalysis  to the  sufficiency  of the  charge  for conspiracy  to\ncommit bank fraud.\n\n                               -17-\n                                17\n\nletter dated August  10, 1987.  This claim,  however, ignores the\n\nevidence that  Jones knew about  the possibility of the  sale and\n\nlease back  arrangement, and  discussed  with Welch  the need  to\n\nobtain releases  from the two  banks.  From this,  the jury could\n\nhave inferred  that even if  Jones did not have  actual knowledge\n\nthat Welch was forging the UCC-3 forms,  he knew that there was a\n\nneed to obtain  a release from the  banks, he was aware  that the\n\nbank would not  allow such a release unless the mortgage was paid\n\nin full, and he  knew that somehow Welch was going  to \"take care\n\nof it.\"  Based on this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude\n\nthat even if there was  no express agreement, Jones sat passively\n\nby  and let his  partner proceed  with the  sale and  lease back,\n\nknowing that the  transaction could not be  completed legally and\n\nwould effect a fraud on the new lender.  \n\n     2.  Bank Fraud Charges\n                           \n\n          In order to convict Jones of bank fraud under 18 U.S.C.\n\n  1344(1), the  jury had to  find beyond a reasonable  doubt that\n\nJones \"engaged  in or attempted to engage  in a pattern or course\n\nof conduct designed  to deceive a federally chartered  or insured\n\nfinancial institution into releasing property, with the intent to\n\nvictimize the  institution by exposing it to  actual or potential\n\nloss.\"  United States  v.

He knew that Kansallis required\n\na release of  the banks' interest and  that such a release  would\n\nnot  be granted unless  the mortgage was  paid off.   Even if, as\n\nWelch testified, Jones never found out about the forgery and just\n\ntrusted  Welch  to  work  out  a deal  which  would  provide  the\n\ndesperately needed  cash, a  rational jury  could have  concluded\n\nthat  Jones deliberately  shut  his eyes  to what  was occurring.\n\n\"The  purpose  of the  willful  blindness  theory  is  to  impose\n\ncriminal liability on  people who, recognizing the  likelihood of\n\nwrongdoing,  nonetheless   consciously  refuse   to  take   basic\n\ninvestigatory steps.\"  United  States v.

R. Crim. P. 14.4   The court denied\n\nhis motion, holding that Jones failed to persuasively demonstrate\n\nthat  he would  incur  prejudice at  trial  as  a result  of  the\n\njoinder.   Jones appeals the denial, arguing that he was a victim\n\nof the prejudicial spillover of evidence against his codefendant,\n\nwho  had already pled  guilty to the  substantive counts charged.\n\nIn addition, Jones  suggests that the jury may have held him to a\n\nhigher standard than Welch since Jones was an attorney.  Finally,\n\nJones argues that the joinder improperly placed him in a position\n\nwhere, in order to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege against\n\nself-incrimination,  he  was  forced to  accept  an  adverse jury\n\ninference.  \n\n          The grant or  denial of a motion for  severance is left\n\nto  the discretion of the trial  court and will only be disturbed\n\nfor an  abuse of that discretion.

In order  to obtain  a severance, a  defendant must\n\nshow  that substantial prejudice,  amounting to a  miscarriage of\n\njustice,  would result  from a  joint  trial.   United States  v.\n                                                                 \n\nSabatino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567584\"><a href=\"/opinion/567584/united-states-v-diane-sabatino-united-states-of-america-v-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96 (1st Cir.  1991).     Mere speculative\n        \n\nallegations as to possible prejudice from joinder  do not sustain\n\nthe burden of  showing an abuse of discretion in denying a motion\n\nfor severance.  \n\n          Jones  failed to  show that  the  presence of  Welch at\n\ntrial was so  prejudicial as to warrant severance.   Welch argued\n\nat  trial that  there was  no  conspiracy between  Jones and  him\n\nbecause Welch  operated on his  own to perpetrate the  fraud upon\n\nthe  banks  and  the  transportation  of  the  forged  documents.\n\nSeveral times on the stand Welch emphasized that he  was the only\n\none responsible for the criminal  acts.  Such evidence could only\n\nbe helpful  to Jones' claim that  he had no knowledge  of Welch's\n\nactivity.  \n\n          Jones'  claim of a spillover effect is also unavailing.\n\nThe  danger which  is to be  prevented is  that the jury  will be\n\nunable to separate  the evidence against different  defendants or\n\nthat evidence which is admissible against only one defendant will\n\nbe used by the jury  against a co-conspirator.  See Perkins,  926\n                                                           \n\n                               -21-\n                                21\n\nF.2d at 1281.  Usually,  however, any prejudice caused by joinder\n\nis  best  dealt  with  through   instructing  the  jury  to  give\n\nindividual consideration  to each  defendant.

Cir.  1981).   Here,  there is  no\n      \n\nevidence, and  Jones has  not identified any,  that the  jury was\n\nunable  to evaluate separately and  fairly the guilt or innocence\n\nof each  defendant.  The judge instructed  the jury that a guilty\n\nplea by Welch could not  be considered as evidence against Jones,\n\nand  also  noted that  each  defendant should  be  given separate\n\nconsideration.  He informed the  jury that any evidence which was\n\nadmitted solely  against one  defendant could  not be  considered\n\nagainst the other defendant.  \n\n          Jones  argues that  the jury  may  have held  him to  a\n\nhigher standard of conduct than  Welch because he is an attorney.\n\nHowever,  Jones presents no  evidence that his  occupation caused\n\nthe  jury to view  him more harshly.   In any  event, Jones could\n\nhave requested a special jury instruction that attorneys are held\n\nto the same standard  of conduct as others, and failed  to do so.\n\nSee  United States  v.

In Porter,  we rejected the\n                                               \n\nargument  that  the  antagonistic defense  of  a  codefendant was\n\ngrounds  for  severance  of  trial  because  it  would  force the\n\ndefendant to  testify in violation  of the Fifth Amendment.   764\n\nF.2d  at 14.   The  need for  severance  to protect  Jones' Fifth\n\nAmendment rights was even more minimal, since Welch's defense was\n\ncompletely in line  with Jones' claim of innocence.   The joinder\n\nhad no impact on Jones' Fifth  Amendment rights and there was  no\n\nabuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal of the motion to\n\nsever.\n\nE.  Severity of Sentence\n                        \n\n          Jones  objects  to  the   length  of  the  fifteen-year\n\nsentence by the trial court.  He argues that a five-year sentence\n\nwould be appropriate  for a first time offender  such as himself.\n\nBecause  we   reverse  Jones'  conviction   for  the   interstate\n\ntransportation of forged  securities, his sentence is  reduced to\n\nfive years  for conspiracy  to commit bank  fraud and  five years\n\neach for two counts of bank fraud, to be served concurrently.  We\n\nsee no  reason  to  alter  Judge  Carter's  assessment  and  pre-\n\nguideline sentencing  on Counts I,  II, and III.
