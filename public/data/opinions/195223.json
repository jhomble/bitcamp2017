This is another in the long line\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\nof sentencing  appeals  that  march  beneath the  banner  of  the\n\nfederal  sentencing guidelines.1    The  appeal  poses  only  one\n\nquestion:  Does a state conviction for extortion, under a statute\n\nthat defines  extortion more  broadly than  in  terms of  threats\n\nagainst  a  person,  qualify  as  a  \"crime  of  violence,\"  and,\n\ntherefore, as a  sentence enhancing factor within the  purview of\n\nU.S.S.G.   2K2.1(a)  (a  guideline which  provides  for  a higher\n\noffense  level,   and,  consequently,   greater  punishment,   if\n\nspecified  offenses  are  committed  by a  person  with  a  prior\n\ncriminal record that includes at least one \"crime  of violence\")?\n\nLike the district court, we answer this query in the affirmative.\n\n                                I\n\n          The facts relevant to  this appeal are not in  dispute.\n\nOn February 12, 1992, federal  agents armed with a warrant issued\n\nas part of an ongoing  mail fraud investigation searched the home\n\nof defendant-appellant  Vito DeLuca and  discovered approximately\n\nfive hundred  rounds of  live ammunition.   A federal  grand jury\n\nthereafter indicted  appellant on  a charge of  being a  felon in\n\npossession  of  ammunition,  see 18  U.S.C.     922(g)(1) (1990).\n                                \n\nAppellant pled guilty to this charge on April 20, 1993.\n\n          At  sentencing, the  district  court embraced  U.S.S.G.\n\n                    \n\n     1In  this instance, the  district court imposed  sentence on\nJune  23,  1993.    Hence,  the  November  1992  edition  of  the\nguidelines applies.  See United States v. Lilly,    F.3d    ,    \n                                               \nn.2 (1st Cir. 1994) [No. 93-1577, slip op. at 3  n.2] (explaining\nthat  \"[a] sentencing court customarily applies the guidelines in\neffect on the date of  sentencing\"); United States v. Harotunian,\n                                                                \n920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990) (same).\n\n                                2\n\n 2K2.1, the guideline covering unlawful possession of ammunition.\n\nThat guideline  dictates a higher  base offense level (BOL)  if a\n\ndefendant  has prior felony convictions  for \"a crime of violence\n\nor a controlled  substance offense.\"  Id.    2K2.1(a).   In 1977,\n                                         \n\nDeLuca had  been convicted of  extortion in a Rhode  Island state\n\ncourt.  To ascertain whether this  conviction constituted a crime\n\nof   violence,  the   district  court  followed   the  Sentencing\n\nCommission's internal cross-reference   U.S.S.G.  2K2.1, comment.\n\n(n.5) refers  the reader to  U.S.S.G.  4B1.2 for a  definition of\n\n\"crime  of violence\"    and  determined  that DeLuca's  extortion\n\nconviction   came   within  the   indicated  definition.     This\n\ndetermination   resulted   in   a  BOL   of   20,   see  U.S.S.G.\n                                                       \n\n 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) (providing  for an  enhanced BOL  if a  defendant\n\n\"has one prior  felony conviction of . . . a crime of violence\"),\n\nrather than 12, see id.  2K2.1(a)(7), and substantially increased\n                       \n\nthe  guideline  sentencing  range applicable  to  DeLuca's  case.\n\nSince   the  district  court  sentenced  within  the  range,  the\n\ndetermination  adversely  affected  appellant's  sentence.   This\n\nappeal ensued.\n\n                                II\n\n          In prosecuting  his  appeal,  DeLuca  presents  a  very\n\nnarrow issue.  He acknowledges that the imposition of sentence is\n\ngoverned by  U.S.S.G.  2K2.1, and, through  cross-referencing, by\n\nthe definitions contained in U.S.S.G.  4B1.2.  He also admits the\n\nauthenticity  of the prior extortion conviction.  He nevertheless\n\nchallenges the classification of that prior conviction as a crime\n\n                                3\n\nof violence, saying that the  language of the state statute under\n\nwhich he was charged, R.I. Gen.  Laws   11-42-2, places his prior\n\nconviction outside the scope of the applicable definition.2\n\n          When, as now, an appeal raises a  purely legal question\n\ninvolving the proper interpretation of the sentencing guidelines,\n\nappellate review is plenary.  See United States v. De Jesus,  984\n                                                           \n\nF.2d 21, 22 n.4 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1, 2  (1st  Cir. 1992),  cert. denied,  113 S.  Ct. 1830  (1993);\n                                     \n\nUnited States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir. 1992).\n                        \n\n                               III\n\n          A  crime of  violence  is defined  for purposes  of the\n\nsentencing guidelines in the following manner:\n\n          The  term  \"crime   of  violence\"  means  any\n          offense under federal or state law punishable\n          by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\n          that  \n\n          (i)  has  as  an  element the  use,  attempted  use, or\n               threatened  use  of  physical  force  against  the\n\n                    \n\n     2The state statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n          Whoever, verbally  or by a written or printed\n          communication,   maliciously   threatens   to\n          accuse another of a crime or  offense or by a\n          verbal or  written communication  maliciously\n          threatens   any   injury   to   the   person,\n          reputation, property  or financial  condition\n          of another, or  threatens to engage in  other\n          criminal  conduct  with   intent  thereby  to\n          extort  money   or  any   unlawful  pecuniary\n          advantage,  or  with  intent  to  compel  any\n          person to do any act  against his will, or to\n          prohibit any person from  carrying out a duty\n          imposed by law shall be punished [as provided\n          by law].\n\nR.I. Gen.  Laws   11-42-2.   It has  not changed in  any material\nrespect since DeLuca was charged and convicted.\n\n                                4\n\n               person of another, or\n\n          (ii) is burglary  of a  dwelling, arson,  or extortion,\n               involves use of  explosives, or otherwise involves\n               conduct that presents a  serious potential risk of\n               physical injury to another.\n\nU.S.S.G.  4B1.2(1).  \"A formal categorical approach   an approach\n\nthat looks to a prior  offense's statutory provenance rather than\n\nto  the actual  facts   is  the method of  choice for determining\n\nwhether a felony  constitutes a targeted crime within the meaning\n\nof this definition.\"  De Jesus, 984 F.2d at 23; accord Fiore, 983\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 3;  see also Taylor v.  United States, 495 U.S.  575, 600\n                                             \n\n(1990) (adopting  categorical approach  for similar  definitional\n\ninquiry under the Armed Career  Criminal Act).  Thus, rather than\n\ninvestigating  the  facts  and   circumstances  of  each  earlier\n\nconviction,  an inquiring court,  in the usual  situation,3 looks\n\nexclusively to the crime as the statute of conviction defined it;\n\nor, put  another  way,  the  court examines  only  the  statutory\n\nformulation of the  predicate crime in order to ascertain whether\n\nthat  crime is  a crime of  violence for purposes  of the federal\n\nsentencing guidelines.\n\n          Appellant accepts this body of  law.  But he strives to\n\npersuade us that,  taking the required categorical  approach, his\n\nprior  conviction cannot  be called  a  crime of  violence.   The\n\n                    \n\n     3To  be sure,  there are  certain  limited circumstances  in\nwhich  some investigation beyond identifying the formal nature of\nthe  charge may  be  warranted.   See  Taylor,  495  U.S. at  602\n                                             \n(outlining  circumstances   in  which   indictment  and-or   jury\ninstructions  may be  pertinent); De  Jesus, 984  F.2d at  23 n.5\n                                           \n(same).   Here, however, we have been given nothing more than the\nrecord of  conviction, and neither  side suggests that  we should\ntry to peer beyond it.\n\n                                5\n\nlinchpin of this theory is the suggestion that all extortions are\n\nnot equal.  Even though the guideline identifies \"extortion\" as a\n\ncrime  of violence,  see U.S.S.G.   4B1.2(1)(ii),  that term,  in\n                        \n\nappellant's  view,  only describes  crimes  that  involve threats\n\nagainst the person of another.   Because the Rhode Island statute\n\nsweeps  more  broadly    it encompasses,  in addition  to threats\n\nagainst  the person, threats against the \"reputation, property or\n\nfinancial condition of another,\"  R.I. Gen. Laws    11-42-2   his\n\nRhode  Island  crime  could  have  involved  a  threat,  say,  of\n\ndefamation, or  economic harm.   On this  view of  the sentencing\n\nuniverse, the government, by leaving  the nature of the threat up\n\nin the air, see supra note 3,  failed to prove that appellant had\n                     \n\nbeen convicted of a crime of violence.\n\n          Although we give appellant high marks for ingenuity, we\n\nare not persuaded.  We  have four principal reasons for rejecting\n\nhis thesis.\n\n          First:   The relevant guideline  provision specifically\n          First:\n               \n\nmentions extortion and, in the process, neither says nor  implies\n\nthat extortion, to  be cognizable, must involve a  threat of harm\n\nto the person of another.  This presents a formidable obstacle to\n\nappellant's  argument, for the wording  of the guideline tells us\n\nunequivocally  that  the   Sentencing  Commission  believed  that\n\nextortion,  by its  nature, should  be classified  as a  crime of\n                          \n\nviolence.    A  defendant who  seeks  to  exclude a  specifically\n\nenumerated  offense from the sweep of section 4B1.2 must shoulder\n\na heavy burden of persuasion.\n\n                                6\n\n          Appellant  seeks   to  carry  this  weighty  burden  by\n\npositing that  the term  \"extortion,\" as it  is used  in U.S.S.G.\n\n 4B1.2(1)(ii),   is  federal  in  character  and  has  a  single,\n\ninvariant meaning, rather than a meaning that  changes from state\n\nto  state.   We agree.   See Taylor,  495 U.S. at  590-92 (ruling\n                                   \n\nthat, for  purposes of the  Armed Career Criminal Act,  the place\n\nwhere  the  offense  was committed  cannot  be  the determinative\n\nfactor  in identifying  predicate  offenses);  Dickerson  v.  New\n                                                                 \n\nBanner Inst., Inc., 460 U.S. 103, 119-120 (1983) (explaining that\n                  \n\nfederal laws should not be construed in such a manner as  to make\n\ntheir   application  depend  on  state  law,  absent  some  plain\n\nlegislative directive to that effect); United States v. Nardello,\n                                                                \n\n393 U.S. 286, 293-94 (1969)  (recommending a similar approach  in\n\nextortion cases); United States v.

Nonetheless,  we  disagree with  appellant's\n\nrelated assertion  that extortion,  as that word  is used  in the\n\nguideline, is limited  to the precise definitional  parameters of\n\nthe Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C.   1951 (1988).4\n\n                    \n\n     4Appellant  hawks the notion  that the relevant  language of\nthe Hobbs Act, criminalizing \"the obtaining of property . .  . by\nwrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or\nunder color of official right,\" 18  U.S.C.   1951, is limited  to\nthreats or  violence against  the person of  another.   The Ninth\n\n                                7\n\n          We  can envision  no sound  reason for  looking to  the\n\nHobbs  Act to  borrow a  definition of  a fairly  well understood\n\nterm.    In  the  first  place, terms  used  within  the  federal\n\nsentencing  guidelines  and   not  specifically  defined  therein\n\ngenerally should be given their  common usage.  See, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Butler, 988 F.2d 537, 542 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 114\n                                                            \n\nS. Ct. 413 (1993); United States v. Jones, 979 F.2d 317,  320 (3d\n                                         \n\nCir. 1992); United States v.  Abney, 756 F. Supp. 310, 313  (E.D.\n                                   \n\nKy. 1990).  Taking this approach, it is clear beyond peradventure\n\nthat a conviction under R.I. Gen. Laws   11-42-2, which can aptly\n\nbe  described as a garden-variety extortion statute, comes within\n\nthe reach of U.S.S.G.  4B1.2(1)(ii).\n\n          In the  second  place, even  if resort  to an  external\n\nsource  is  desirable  in  order  to  explicate  the  meaning  of\n\n\"extortion,\" we  think that,  rather than the  Hobbs Act    which\n\nfeatures extortion in  a special, circumscribed sense    a better\n\npoint  of reference  would be  section 223.4  of the  Model Penal\n\nCode.5  This  definition is widely  accepted, see, e.g.,  Black's\n                                                       \n\n                    \n\nCircuit seems  to have embraced this idea.   See United States v.\n                                                              \nAnderson, 989 F.2d 310, 312-13 (9th Cir. 1993).\n        \n\n     5The  Model  Penal Code  defines  extortion as  purposefully\nobtaining the property of another by threatening to:\n\n          (1) inflict bodily injury on anyone or commit\n          any other criminal offense; or\n          (2) accuse anyone of a criminal offense; or\n          (3) expose any secret  tending to subject any\n          person to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or to\n          impair his credit or business repute; or\n          (4) take or withhold  action as an  official,\n          or cause  an  official to  take  or  withhold\n          action; or\n\n                                8\n\nLaw Dictionary  585 (6th  ed. 1990), and  is consistent  with the\n\ntenor of the  most closely analogous federal  crime, extortionate\n\nextension of credit,  18 U.S.C.   891 (1988) (proscribing threats\n\nof harm to \"the person,  reputation, or property of any person\");\n\nsee also  18 U.S.C.    876 (1988)  (proscribing, inter  alia, the\n                                                            \n\nmailing of threatening  communications for extortionate  purposes\n\n\"to injure  the property  or reputation of  the addressee,  or of\n\nanother\").   Hence, defining  extortion in  this commonsense  way\n\nalso   makes  it   clear  that   section  4B1.2(1)(ii)   subsumes\n\nappellant's prior conviction.\n\n          Second:  Even if we were  to look to the Hobbs Act,  as\n          Second:\n                \n\nappellant importunes,  we believe  the \"fear\"  element under  the\n\nHobbs  Act can  be satisfied  by  threats other  than threats  of\n\nbodily harm, say, by putting the victim in fear of economic harm.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Salerno, 868 F.2d 524, 531 (2d Cir.),\n                                   \n\ncert. denied, 493 U.S. 811 (1989); United States v.

Thus,\n                                   \n\nalthough the Rhode Island extortion statute does not  track, word\n\nfor  word, the  Hobbs Act  definition of  extortion, the  two are\n\nsufficiently similar  both in  import and  application to  defuse\n\nappellant's argument.\n\n          Third:    We have  often  said that,  \"[a]ll  words and\n          Third:\n               \n\nprovisions of statutes are intended to have meaning and are to be\n\ngiven effect, and  no construction should be  adopted which would\n\nrender  statutory  words  or phrases  meaningless,  redundant  or\n\nsuperfluous.\"   Lamore v.

We think  that  this principle  is  fully\n\napplicable to the sentencing guidelines, which, although they are\n\nnot statutes, are  to be construed in much the same fashion.  See\n                                                                 \n\nUnited States v.

Appellant's spin on the word \"extortion,\"\n\nas that  word is used  in section 4B1.2(1)(ii), would  reduce the\n\nreference to mere  surplusage.  After all, a  different clause in\n\nthe same  guideline makes a  prior conviction for any  crime that\n                                                     \n\n\"has  as an element  the . .  . threatened use  of physical force\n\nagainst the  person of  another\" a crime  of violence.   U.S.S.G.\n\n 4B1.2(1)(i).  Thus,  were extortion defined  in the cramped  way\n\nthat appellant touts, the Sentencing Commission's inclusion of it\n\nas a  specially enumerated offense  serves no purpose.   In other\n\n                                10\n\nwords, if extortion is intended  to refer only to threats against\n\na person, it is totally redundant.\n\n          Fourth:  We believe that appellant's reliance on United\n          Fourth:\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

The  Anderson court\n                                                           \n\nrelied  heavily on the fact that the defendant's prior conviction\n\nwas for an  attempt, not a completed act of extortion, see id. at\n                                                              \n\n313, and found that  fact sufficient to remove the  case from the\n\nintegument  of the  ACCA, see  id.   Here, however,  it does  not\n                                  \n\nmatter  whether one  calls  the crime  of which  appellant stands\n\nconvicted  \"extortion\"  or  \"attempted  extortion.\"    Regardless\n\nwhether  an  attempt  counts  as  a  completed offense  for  ACCA\n\npurposes,  the  sentencing guidelines  are  transpicuous on  this\n\npoint:  \"The terms `crime of  violence' and `controlled substance\n\noffense' include the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring,\n\nand  attempting to  commit  such  offenses,\"  U.S.S.G.     4B1.2,\n               \n\ncomment.

Because \"commentary  in the\n\nGuidelines  Manual that  interprets or  explains  a guideline  is\n\nauthoritative  unless it violates  the Constitution or  a federal\n\nstatute, or is  inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading\n\nof, that  guideline,\" Stinson v.

Sec. 2K2.1(a) (a guideline which provides for a higher offense level, and, consequently, greater punishment, if specified offenses are committed by a person with a prior criminal record that includes at least one \"crime of violence\")?  Like the district court, we answer this query in the affirmative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The facts relevant to this appeal are not in dispute.  On February 12, 1992, federal agents armed with a warrant issued as part of an ongoing mail fraud investigation searched the home of defendant-appellant Vito DeLuca and discovered approximately five hundred rounds of live ammunition.  A federal grand jury thereafter indicted appellant on a charge of being a felon in possession of ammunition, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1) (1990).  Appellant pled guilty to this charge on April 20, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court embraced U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1, the guideline covering unlawful possession of ammunition.  That guideline dictates a higher base offense level (BOL) if a defendant has prior felony convictions for \"a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\"   Id. Sec. 2K2.1(a).  In 1977, DeLuca had been convicted of extortion in a Rhode Island state court.  To ascertain whether this conviction constituted a crime of violence, the district court followed the Sentencing Commission's internal cross-reference--U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1, comment.  (n. 5) refers the reader to U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2 for a definition of \"crime of violence\"--and determined that DeLuca's extortion conviction came within the indicated definition.  This determination resulted in a BOL of 20, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) (providing for an enhanced BOL if a defendant \"has one prior felony conviction of ... a crime of violence\"), rather than 12, see id. Sec. 2K2.1(a)(7), and substantially increased the guideline sentencing range applicable to DeLuca's case.  Since the district court sentenced within the range, the determination adversely affected appellant's sentence.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In prosecuting his appeal, DeLuca presents a very narrow issue.  He acknowledges that the imposition of sentence is governed by U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1, and, through cross-referencing, by the definitions contained in U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2.  He also admits the authenticity of the prior extortion conviction.  He nevertheless challenges the classification of that prior conviction as a crime of violence, saying that the language of the state statute under which he was charged, R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 11-42-2, places his prior conviction outside the scope of the applicable definition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as now, an appeal raises a purely legal question involving the proper interpretation of the sentencing guidelines, appellate review is plenary.

Sec. 4B1.2(1).  \"A formal categorical approach--an approach that looks to a prior offense's statutory provenance rather than to the actual facts--is the method of choice for determining whether a felony constitutes a targeted crime within the meaning of this definition.\"  De Jesus, 984 F.2d at 23;  accord Fiore, 983 F.2d at 3;  see also Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (adopting categorical approach for similar definitional inquiry under the Armed Career Criminal Act).  Thus, rather than investigating the facts and circumstances of each earlier conviction, an inquiring court, in the usual situation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> looks exclusively to the crime as the statute of conviction defined it;  or, put another way, the court examines only the statutory formulation of the predicate crime in order to ascertain whether that crime is a crime of violence for purposes of the federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant accepts this body of law.  But he strives to persuade us that, taking the required categorical approach, his prior conviction cannot be called a crime of violence.  The linchpin of this theory is the suggestion that all extortions are not equal.  Even though the guideline identifies \"extortion\" as a crime of violence, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii), that term, in appellant's view, only describes crimes that involve threats against the person of another.  Because the Rhode Island statute sweeps more broadly--it encompasses, in addition to threats against the person, threats against the \"reputation, property or financial condition of another,\" R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 11-42-2--his Rhode Island crime could have involved a threat, say, of defamation, or economic harm.  On this view of the sentencing universe, the government, by leaving the nature of the threat up in the air, see supra note 3, failed to prove that appellant had been convicted of a crime of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we give appellant high marks for ingenuity, we are not persuaded.  We have four principal reasons for rejecting his thesis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First:  The relevant guideline provision specifically mentions extortion and, in the process, neither says nor implies that extortion, to be cognizable, must involve a threat of harm to the person of another.  This presents a formidable obstacle to appellant's argument, for the wording of the guideline tells us unequivocally that the Sentencing Commission believed that extortion, by its nature, should be classified as a crime of violence.  A defendant who seeks to exclude a specifically enumerated offense from the sweep of section 4B1.2 must shoulder a heavy burden of persuasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant seeks to carry this weighty burden by positing that the term \"extortion,\" as it is used in U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii), is federal in character and has a single, invariant meaning, rather than a meaning that changes from state to state.  We agree.  See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 590-92, 110 S.Ct. at 2153-55 (ruling that, for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, the place where the offense was committed cannot be the determinative factor in identifying predicate offenses);  Dickerson v. New Banner Inst., Inc., 460 U.S. 103, 119-120, 103 S.Ct. 986, 995-996, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983) (explaining that federal laws should not be construed in such a manner as to make their application depend on state law, absent some plain legislative directive to that effect);  United States v. Nardello, 393 U.S. 286, 293-94, 89 S.Ct. 534, 538, 21 L.Ed.2d 487 (1969) (recommending a similar approach in extortion cases);  United States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 71 (1st Cir.1991) (rejecting state-law characterization of prior state conviction for purposes of the federal sentencing guidelines);  United States v. Unger, 915 F.2d 759, 762-63 (1st Cir.1990) (rejecting \"the idea that state law determines whether an offense runs afoul of [U.S.S.G.] section 4A1.2(c)(2)\"), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1104, 111 S.Ct. 1005, 112 L.Ed.2d 1088 (1991).  Nonetheless, we disagree with appellant's related assertion that extortion, as that word is used in the guideline, is limited to the precise definitional parameters of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951 (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can envision no sound reason for looking to the Hobbs Act to borrow a definition of a fairly well understood term.  In the first place, terms used within the federal sentencing guidelines and not specifically defined therein generally should be given their common usage.  See, e.g., United States v. Butler, 988 F.2d 537, 542 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 413, 126 L.Ed.2d 359 (1993);  United States v. Jones, 979 F.2d 317, 320 (3d Cir.1992);  United States v. Abney, 756 F.Supp. 310, 313 (E.D.Ky.1990).  Taking this approach, it is clear beyond peradventure that a conviction under R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 11-42-2, which can aptly be described as a garden-variety extortion statute, comes within the reach of U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, even if resort to an external source is desirable in order to explicate the meaning of \"extortion,\" we think that, rather than the Hobbs Act--which features extortion in a special, circumscribed sense--a better point of reference would be section 223.4 of the Model Penal Code.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  This definition is widely accepted, see, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 585 (6th ed. 1990), and is consistent with the tenor of the most closely analogous federal crime, extortionate extension of credit, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 891 (1988) (proscribing threats of harm to \"the person, reputation, or property of any person\");  see also 18 U.S.C. Sec. 876 (1988) (proscribing, inter alia, the mailing of threatening communications for extortionate purposes \"to injure the property or reputation of the addressee, or of another\").  Hence, defining extortion in this commonsense way also makes it clear that section 4B1.2(1)(ii) subsumes appellant's prior conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second:  Even if we were to look to the Hobbs Act, as appellant importunes, we believe the \"fear\" element under the Hobbs Act can be satisfied by threats other than threats of bodily harm, say, by putting the victim in fear of economic harm.  See, e.g., United States v. Salerno, 868 F.2d 524, 531 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 811, 110 S.Ct. 56, 107 L.Ed.2d 24 (1989);  United States v. Hathaway, 534 F.2d 386, 393-94 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 819, 97 S.Ct. 64, 50 L.Ed.2d 79 (1976);  United States v. DeMet, 486 F.2d 816, 819 (7th Cir.1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 969, 94 S.Ct. 1991, 40 L.Ed.2d 558 (1974);  United States v. Addonizio, 451 F.2d 49, 72 (3d Cir.1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 936, 92 S.Ct. 949, 30 L.Ed.2d 812 (1972).  Thus, although the Rhode Island extortion statute does not track, word for word, the Hobbs Act definition of extortion, the two are sufficiently similar both in import and application to defuse appellant's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third:  We have often said that, \"[a]ll words and provisions of statutes are intended to have meaning and are to be given effect, and no construction should be adopted which would render statutory words or phrases meaningless, redundant or superfluous.\"  Lamore v. Ives, 977 F.2d 713, 716-17 (1st Cir.1992);  accord United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir.1985).  We think that this principle is fully applicable to the sentencing guidelines, which, although they are not statutes, are to be construed in much the same fashion.  See United States v. Shaw, 979 F.2d 41, 45 (5th Cir.1992);  United States v. McGann, 960 F.2d 846, 847 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 276, 121 L.Ed.2d 204 (1992);  United States v. Castellanos, 904 F.2d 1490, 1497 (11th Cir.1990).  Appellant's spin on the word \"extortion,\" as that word is used in section 4B1.2(1)(ii), would reduce the reference to mere surplusage.  After all, a different clause in the same guideline makes a prior conviction for any crime that \"has as an element the ... threatened use of physical force against the person of another\" a crime of violence.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(i).  Thus, were extortion defined in the cramped way that appellant touts, the Sentencing Commission's inclusion of it as a specially enumerated offense serves no purpose.  In other words, if extortion is intended to refer only to threats against a person, it is totally redundant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth:  We believe that appellant's reliance on United States v. Anderson, 989 F.2d 310 (9th Cir.1993), is mislaid.  Anderson involved a sentence imposed under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e) (ACCA).  The Anderson court relied heavily on the fact that the defendant's prior conviction was for an attempt, not a completed act of extortion, see id. at 313, and found that fact sufficient to remove the case from the integument of the ACCA, see id.   Here, however, it does not matter whether one calls the crime of which appellant stands convicted \"extortion\" or \"attempted extortion.\"   Regardless whether an attempt counts as a completed offense for ACCA purposes, the sentencing guidelines are transpicuous on this point:  \"The terms 'crime of violence' and 'controlled substance offense' include the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses,\" U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2, comment.  (n.1) (emphasis supplied).  Because \"commentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline,\" Stinson v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993);  see also United States v. Zapata, 1 F.3d 46, 47 (1st Cir.1993), we cannot follow Anderson in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Concluding, as we do, that the lower court correctly categorized appellant's 1977 extortion conviction as a \"crime of violence\" under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), we reject the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In this instance, the district court imposed sentence on June 23, 1993.

Sec. 2K2.1(a) (a guideline which provides for a higher offense level, and, consequently, greater punishment, if specified offenses are committed by a person with a prior criminal record that includes at least one \"crime of violence\")?  Like the district court, we answer this query in the affirmative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The facts relevant to this appeal are not in dispute.  On February 12, 1992, federal agents armed with a warrant issued as part of an ongoing mail fraud investigation searched the home of defendant-appellant Vito DeLuca and discovered approximately five hundred rounds of live ammunition.  A federal grand jury thereafter indicted appellant on a charge of being a felon in possession of ammunition, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1) (1990).  Appellant pled guilty to this charge on April 20, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court embraced U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1, the guideline covering unlawful possession of ammunition.  That guideline dictates a higher base offense level (BOL) if a defendant has prior felony convictions for \"a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\"   Id. Sec. 2K2.1(a).  In 1977, DeLuca had been convicted of extortion in a Rhode Island state court.  To ascertain whether this conviction constituted a crime of violence, the district court followed the Sentencing Commission's internal cross-reference--U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1, comment.  (n. 5) refers the reader to U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2 for a definition of \"crime of violence\"--and determined that DeLuca's extortion conviction came within the indicated definition.  This determination resulted in a BOL of 20, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) (providing for an enhanced BOL if a defendant \"has one prior felony conviction of ... a crime of violence\"), rather than 12, see id. Sec. 2K2.1(a)(7), and substantially increased the guideline sentencing range applicable to DeLuca's case.  Since the district court sentenced within the range, the determination adversely affected appellant's sentence.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In prosecuting his appeal, DeLuca presents a very narrow issue.  He acknowledges that the imposition of sentence is governed by U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1, and, through cross-referencing, by the definitions contained in U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2.  He also admits the authenticity of the prior extortion conviction.  He nevertheless challenges the classification of that prior conviction as a crime of violence, saying that the language of the state statute under which he was charged, R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 11-42-2, places his prior conviction outside the scope of the applicable definition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as now, an appeal raises a purely legal question involving the proper interpretation of the sentencing guidelines, appellate review is plenary.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span> (1990) (adopting categorical approach for similar definitional inquiry under the Armed Career Criminal Act).  Thus, rather than investigating the facts and circumstances of each earlier conviction, an inquiring court, in the usual situation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> looks exclusively to the crime as the statute of conviction defined it;  or, put another way, the court examines only the statutory formulation of the predicate crime in order to ascertain whether that crime is a crime of violence for purposes of the federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant accepts this body of law.  But he strives to persuade us that, taking the required categorical approach, his prior conviction cannot be called a crime of violence.  The linchpin of this theory is the suggestion that all extortions are not equal.  Even though the guideline identifies \"extortion\" as a crime of violence, see U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii), that term, in appellant's view, only describes crimes that involve threats against the person of another.  Because the Rhode Island statute sweeps more broadly--it encompasses, in addition to threats against the person, threats against the \"reputation, property or financial condition of another,\" R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 11-42-2--his Rhode Island crime could have involved a threat, say, of defamation, or economic harm.  On this view of the sentencing universe, the government, by leaving the nature of the threat up in the air, see supra note 3, failed to prove that appellant had been convicted of a crime of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we give appellant high marks for ingenuity, we are not persuaded.  We have four principal reasons for rejecting his thesis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First:  The relevant guideline provision specifically mentions extortion and, in the process, neither says nor implies that extortion, to be cognizable, must involve a threat of harm to the person of another.  This presents a formidable obstacle to appellant's argument, for the wording of the guideline tells us unequivocally that the Sentencing Commission believed that extortion, by its nature, should be classified as a crime of violence.  A defendant who seeks to exclude a specifically enumerated offense from the sweep of section 4B1.2 must shoulder a heavy burden of persuasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant seeks to carry this weighty burden by positing that the term \"extortion,\" as it is used in U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii), is federal in character and has a single, invariant meaning, rather than a meaning that changes from state to state.  We agree.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1088</span></span> (1991).  Nonetheless, we disagree with appellant's related assertion that extortion, as that word is used in the guideline, is limited to the precise definitional parameters of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951 (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can envision no sound reason for looking to the Hobbs Act to borrow a definition of a fairly well understood term.  In the first place, terms used within the federal sentencing guidelines and not specifically defined therein generally should be given their common usage.  See, e.g., United States v. Butler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602377\"><a href=\"/opinion/602377/united-states-v-roland-eugene-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 542 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></span> (1993);  United States v.

Taking this approach, it is clear beyond peradventure that a conviction under R.I.Gen.Laws Sec. 11-42-2, which can aptly be described as a garden-variety extortion statute, comes within the reach of U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, even if resort to an external source is desirable in order to explicate the meaning of \"extortion,\" we think that, rather than the Hobbs Act--which features extortion in a special, circumscribed sense--a better point of reference would be section 223.4 of the Model Penal Code.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  This definition is widely accepted, see, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 585 (6th ed. 1990), and is consistent with the tenor of the most closely analogous federal crime, extortionate extension of credit, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 891 (1988) (proscribing threats of harm to \"the person, reputation, or property of any person\");  see also 18 U.S.C. Sec. 876 (1988) (proscribing, inter alia, the mailing of threatening communications for extortionate purposes \"to injure the property or reputation of the addressee, or of another\").  Hence, defining extortion in this commonsense way also makes it clear that section 4B1.2(1)(ii) subsumes appellant's prior conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second:  Even if we were to look to the Hobbs Act, as appellant importunes, we believe the \"fear\" element under the Hobbs Act can be satisfied by threats other than threats of bodily harm, say, by putting the victim in fear of economic harm.  See, e.g., United States v. Salerno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518844\"><a href=\"/opinion/518844/united-states-v-anthony-salerno-carmine-persico-gennaro-langella/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>, 531 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, although the Rhode Island extortion statute does not track, word for word, the Hobbs Act definition of extortion, the two are sufficiently similar both in import and application to defuse appellant's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third:  We have often said that, \"[a]ll words and provisions of statutes are intended to have meaning and are to be given effect, and no construction should be adopted which would render statutory words or phrases meaningless, redundant or superfluous.\"  Lamore v. Ives, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593174\"><a href=\"/opinion/593174/39-socsecrepser-153-medicare-medicaid-guide-p-40867-athalie-lamore/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 716-17 (1st Cir.1992);  accord United States v.

We think that this principle is fully applicable to the sentencing guidelines, which, although they are not statutes, are to be construed in much the same fashion.  See United States v. Shaw, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"594428\"><a href=\"/opinion/594428/united-states-v-thomas-lowell-shaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 45 (5th Cir.1992);  United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></span> (1992);  United States v. Castellanos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542921\"><a href=\"/opinion/542921/united-states-v-alejandro-castellanos/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1490</span></a></span>, 1497 (11th Cir.1990).  Appellant's spin on the word \"extortion,\" as that word is used in section 4B1.2(1)(ii), would reduce the reference to mere surplusage.  After all, a different clause in the same guideline makes a prior conviction for any crime that \"has as an element the ... threatened use of physical force against the person of another\" a crime of violence.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2(1)(i).  Thus, were extortion defined in the cramped way that appellant touts, the Sentencing Commission's inclusion of it as a specially enumerated offense serves no purpose.  In other words, if extortion is intended to refer only to threats against a person, it is totally redundant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth:  We believe that appellant's reliance on United States v. Anderson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602896\"><a href=\"/opinion/602896/united-states-v-brian-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1993), is mislaid.  Anderson involved a sentence imposed under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e) (ACCA).  The Anderson court relied heavily on the fact that the defendant's prior conviction was for an attempt, not a completed act of extortion, see id. at 313, and found that fact sufficient to remove the case from the integument of the ACCA, see id.   Here, however, it does not matter whether one calls the crime of which appellant stands convicted \"extortion\" or \"attempted extortion.\"   Regardless whether an attempt counts as a completed offense for ACCA purposes, the sentencing guidelines are transpicuous on this point:  \"The terms 'crime of violence' and 'controlled substance offense' include the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses,\" U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.2, comment.  (n.1) (emphasis supplied).  Because \"commentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline,\" Stinson v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span> (1993);  see also United States v. Zapata, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194834\"><a href=\"/opinion/194834/united-states-v-zapata-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.1993), we cannot follow Anderson in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Concluding, as we do, that the lower court correctly categorized appellant's 1977 extortion conviction as a \"crime of violence\" under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), we reject the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In this instance, the district court imposed sentence on June 23, 1993.
