The question presented is whether\n\nthe   New   Hampshire   School    Patriot   Act,   N.H.   Rev.   Stat.   Ann.\n\n§ 194:15-c (\"the New Hampshire Act\"), which requires that the\n\nstate's public schools authorize a period during the school day for\n\nstudents to voluntarily participate in the recitation of the Pledge\n\nof Allegiance, violates the First or Fourteenth Amendment to the\n\nConstitution of the United States.          We hold that the statute is\n\nconstitutional and affirm entry of judgment for defendants.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            Plaintiffs are The Freedom From Religion Foundation, its\n\nmembers Jan and Pat Doe, and their three children who attend New\n\nHampshire public schools (collectively \"FFRF\").            Jan and Pat Doe\n\nidentify themselves as atheist and agnostic, respectively, and\n\ntheir children as either atheist or agnostic.             At the time the\n\namended complaint was filed in 2008, the eldest child was in sixth\n\ngrade and attended a middle school jointly administered by New\n\nHampshire's Hanover and Dresden school districts, while the younger\n\ntwo children were enrolled in a public elementary school operated\n\nby the Hanover district.         Pursuant to the New Hampshire Act, the\n\nPledge of Allegiance (\"the Pledge\") is routinely recited in the Doe\n\nchildren's classrooms under the leadership of their teachers.1\n\n\n      1\n          FFRF alleges that the Doe children \"have all been led by\ntheir public school teachers in recitations of the Pledge of\nAllegiance.\" First Am. Complt. ¶ 43, ECF No. 52. New Hampshire\nhas not contested this. The parties have not provided any other\nspecific information about the operation of the statute such as the\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          The full text of the New Hampshire Act, enacted in 2002,\n\nis as follows:\n\n                 I. As a continuation of the policy of\n          teaching   our   country's  history   to   the\n          elementary and secondary pupils of this state,\n          this section shall be known as the New\n          Hampshire School Patriot Act.\n\n                 II. A school district shall authorize\n          a period of time during the school day for the\n          recitation of the pledge of allegiance. Pupil\n          participation in the recitation of the pledge\n          of allegiance shall be voluntary.\n\n                 III. Pupils not participating in the\n          recitation of the pledge of allegiance may\n          silently stand or remain seated but shall be\n          required to respect the rights of those pupils\n          electing to participate. If this paragraph\n          shall be declared to be unconstitutional or\n          otherwise invalid, the remaining paragraphs in\n          this section shall not be affected, and shall\n          continue in full force and effect.\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 194:15-c.\n\n          Several aspects of the statute are worth note.              By\n\nexpressly requiring that student participation in the recitation of\n\nthe Pledge be voluntary, New Hampshire has created a framework in\n\nwhich a school or educator would violate state law by any actions\n\nthat rendered student participation involuntary.      In addition, the\n\nstatute allows any student not to participate in the recitation of\n\nthe   Pledge   regardless   of   the    student's   reasons   for   non-\n\nparticipation.    Those who do not participate may either stand\n\nsilently or remain seated.       The only obligation imposed on non-\n\n\nprocedures used or the number of students who participate.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fparticipants is that they respect the rights of those students\n\nelecting to participate.\n\n          The New Hampshire Act itself does not identify the words\n\nof the Pledge or otherwise specify which words should be used.   The\n\nparties accept that the words of the Pledge that are used in New\n\nHampshire schools are those codified in federal law: \"I pledge\n\nallegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the\n\nRepublic for which it stands, one Nation under God,2 indivisible,\n\nwith liberty and justice for all.\"      4 U.S.C. § 4 (\"the federal\n\nPledge statute\").   The Pledge, which dates to 1892,3 was first\n\ncodified in 1942 to clarify the \"rules and customs pertaining to\n\nthe display and use of the flag of the United States of America.\"\n\nSee Act of June 22, 1942, Pub. L. No. 77-623, 56 Stat. 377.      The\n\nwords \"under God\" were added in 1954.    See Act of June 14, 1954,\n\nPub. L. No. 83-396, 68 Stat. 249.4\n\n\n     2\n          Throughout the opinion, we refer to \"God\" as used in the\ntext of the Pledge.\n     3\n          In 1892, as part of the commemoration of the 400th\nanniversary of Christopher Columbus's discovery of America, a\nnational magazine for youth proposed that students in school recite\nthe following affirmation: \"I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the\nRepublic for which it stands: one Nation indivisible, with Liberty\nand Justice for all.\" Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542\nU.S. 1, 6 (2004) (citing J. Baer, The Pledge of Allegiance: A\nCentennial History, 1892-1992, at 3 (1992)) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n     4\n          The taking of a pledge         of allegiance pre-dates\nChristianity. Certain Athenian males,     at puberty, took a longer\npledge, the opening three sentences of   which were: \"We will never\nbring disgrace to this, our city, by      any act of dishonesty or\n\n                               -5-\n\f           The procedural history of the case before us is not\n\ncomplicated. On November 1, 2007, FFRF filed a lawsuit against the\n\nUnited States Congress and United State of America (\"the Federal\n\nDefendants\"),   the   Hanover   School   District   and   Dresden   School\n\nDistrict (\"the School Districts\"), and School Administrative Unit\n\n70.5   FFRF sought a declaration that the federal Pledge statute and\n\nthe recitation of the Pledge in New Hampshire's public schools\n\nviolated various provisions of the U.S. Constitution, the New\n\n\n\n\ncowardice, nor ever desert our suffering comrades in ranks. We\nwill fight for the ideals and sacred things of the city, both alone\nand with many; we will revere and obey the city's law and do our\nbest to incite a like respect and reverence in those above us who\nare prone to annul and set them at naught.          We will strive\nunceasingly to quicken the public's sense of civic duty, that thus,\nin all these ways, we will transmit this city not only not less,\nbut greater, better, and more beautiful than it was transmitted to\nus.\" Pledge of Allegiance, Lapham's Quarterly, Fall 2010, at 98.\n       5\n          FFRF's claim against School Administrative Unit 70, which\ncontrols the high schools that the Doe children will eventually\nattend, was dropped in the amended complaint.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fHampshire Constitution, and federal and state law,6 and requested\n\ninjunctive relief to ensure the end of these violations.7\n\n           The State of New Hampshire, the United States of America,\n\nand Muriel Cyrus--a student in the Hanover School district, joined\n\nby a group of other students, five of their parents, and the\n\nKnights of Columbus--filed motions to intervene to assist in the\n\ndefense of the New Hampshire      Act.8   The court granted these\n\nmotions.\n\n\n\n     6\n          Specifically, FFRF sought a declaration that Congress\nviolated the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses in passing the\nAct of 1954, which added the words \"under God\" to the Pledge; that\nthe words \"under God\" in the Pledge violated the Establishment and\nFree Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, the Equal Protection\ncomponent of the Fifth Amendment, and The Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act (RFRA); and that the School Districts, in having\ntheir agents lead the recitation of the Pledge, violated the\nEstablishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the RFRA,\nArticle 6 of the New Hampshire Constitution, and other provisions\nof New Hampshire state law.\n     7\n          FFRF asked the court to \"demand\" that Congress act to\nremove the words \"under God\" from 4 U.S.C. § 4; that the United\nStates use its power to remove the words \"under God\" from 4 U.S.C.\n§ 4; and that the School Districts cease and desist using the\nPledge.\n     8\n          Although the United States was already a defendant with\nrespect to FFRF's claim that 4 U.S.C. § 4 is unconstitutional on\nits face, it was not a defendant with respect to FFRF's claims\nchallenging the recitation of the Pledge in New Hampshire schools,\nand it therefore moved to intervene as a defendant against what it\ntook to be an as-applied challenge to 4 U.S.C. § 4. While the\ndistrict court allowed the United State to intervene, it ultimately\nrejected the argument that the federal statute was being \"applied,\"\nas the statute merely prescribes the text of the Pledge and does\nnot command any person to recite it or lead others in its\nrecitation.\n\n                                -7-\n\f           On August 7, 2008, the Federal Defendants filed a motion\n\nto dismiss the claims against them, which the court granted.9         The\n\nconstitutionality of the federal Pledge statute, 4 U.S.C. § 4, is\n\nnot at issue in this appeal.\n\n           FFRF filed an amended complaint on November 17, 2008,\n\nnaming only the School Districts as defendants.      FFRF alleged that\n\nthe School Districts had or would violate the rights of the Doe\n\nchildren   under   the   First   Amendment's   Establishment   and   Free\n\nExercise Clauses; the rights of the Doe parents under the Free\n\nExercise Clause; the rights of both the Doe children and their\n\nparents under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses; and the\n\nDoe parents' federal constitutional rights of parenthood, as well\n\nas the Doe children's concomitant rights.10      The United States, New\n\nHampshire, and Cyrus then renewed their motions to dismiss.11\n\n           On September 30, 2009, the district court dismissed all\n\nof FFRF's federal claims on their merits,12 and issued a final\n\n\n     9\n          The Federal Defendants' motion also requested dismissal\nof the claims against the School Districts on the grounds that FFRF\nfailed to state a claim, but this part of the motion was denied, as\nthe School Districts had not filed a motion to dismiss.\n     10\n          FFRF also advanced a variety of state law claims that are\nnot before us on appeal.\n     11\n          The district court construed these motions to dismiss as\nhaving been advanced by the School Districts as well.\n     12\n          Having done so, the court found that principles of comity\ncounseled in favor of not exercising supplemental jurisdiction over\nthe remaining state law claims and dismissed the state claims\nwithout prejudice.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fjudgment in favor of the United States, the School Districts, and\n\nCyrus.\n\n             FFRF filed a timely notice of appeal from the district\n\ncourt's     dismissal       of   its    federal     claims    against   the    School\n\nDistricts.\n\n                                           II.\n\n             The issue on appeal is whether the New Hampshire Act\n\nrequiring     that    its    public      schools    provide    a   period     for   the\n\nvoluntary recitation of the Pledge violates the Establishment\n\nClause, Free Exercise Clause, Equal Protection Clause, or Due\n\nProcess Clause.       We review de novo the district court's dismissal\n\nof FFRF's amended complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), accepting as true\n\nall well-pleaded facts in the complaint and drawing all reasonable\n\ninferences in the plaintiffs' favor.                   Sutliffe v. Epping Sch.\n\nDist., 584 F.3d 314, 325 (1st Cir. 2009).                     The issue is one of\n\nlaw.13    No material facts are in dispute.\n\nA.           The Pledge Does not Violate the Establishment Clause\n\n             Under the Establishment Clause, \"Congress shall make no\n\nlaw respecting an establishment of religion.\"                  U.S. Const. amend.\n\nI.       Although    applicable        originally    only    against    the   federal\n\n\n     13\n          Every federal circuit court that has addressed a state\npledge statute has rejected the claim of unconstitutionality. See\nCroft v. Perry, No. 09-10347, 2010 WL 3991719 (5th Cir. Oct. 13,\n2010); Newdow v. Rio Linda Union Sch. Dist., 597 F.3d 1007 (2010);\nMyers v. Loudoun County Pub. Sch., 418 F.3d 395 (4th Cir. 2005);\nSherman v. Cmty. Consol. Sch. Dist. 21, 980 F.2d 437 (7th Cir.\n1992).\n\n                                           -9-\n\fgovernment, the Establishment Clause was incorporated to apply to\n\nthe states by the Fourteenth Amendment.                Everson v. Bd. of Educ.,\n\n330 U.S. 1, 8 (1947).\n\n            In    determining        whether    a    law     runs    afoul     of   this\n\nprohibition, the Supreme Court has articulated three interrelated\n\nanalytical approaches: the three-prong analysis set forth in Lemon\n\nv.   Kurtzman,    403   U.S.    602,     612-13      (1971);    the      \"endorsement\"\n\nanalysis, first articulated by Justice O'Connor in her concurrence\n\nin Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 688 (1984), and applied by a\n\nmajority of the Court in County of Allegheny v. ACLU, 492 U.S. 573\n\n(1989); and the \"coercion\" analysis of Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S.\n\n577, 587 (1992).14 Before applying the three approaches to the case\n\nbefore us, we first address a few general matters.\n\n            FFRF's argument is that the School Districts' Pledge\n\npractices pursuant to the New Hampshire Act are religious for\n\npurposes of the First Amendment because the Pledge itself is a\n\nreligious exercise in that it uses the phrase \"under God.\"                          FFRF\n\nargues     that   despite      the     voluntary      nature        of   any    student\n\nparticipation     in    the    Pledge,    the       result    is    nonetheless      the\n\nestablishment by the state of religion.\n\n\n\n      14\n          There is an abundance of commentary from courts and\nothers as to the relationship between these three analytical\napproaches. See, e.g., Freethought Soc. of Greater Philadelphia v.\nChester County, 334 F.3d 247, 256-62 (3rd Cir. 2003); Mellen v.\nBunting, 327 F.3d 355, 370-71 (4th Cir. 2003); Adland v. Russ, 307\nF.3d 471, 479 (6th Cir. 2002). We bypass the question.\n\n                                        -10-\n\f            As to the first part of the argument, we begin with the\n\nunremarkable proposition that the phrase \"under God\" has some\n\nreligious content.      In our view, mere repetition of the phrase in\n\nsecular ceremonies does not by itself deplete the phrase of all\n\nreligious content.15     A belief in God is a religious belief.          That\n\nthe phrase has some religious content is demonstrated by the fact\n\nthat those who are religious, as well as those who are not, could\n\nreasonably be offended by the claim that it does not.             See Myers v.\n\nLoudoun County Pub. Sch., 418 F.3d 395, 407 (4th Cir. 2005)\n\n(\"Undoubtedly, the Pledge contains a religious phrase, and it is\n\ndemeaning to persons of any faith to assert that the words 'under\n\nGod' contain no religious significance.\"); see also Van Orden v.\n\nPerry,    545   U.S.   677,   695-96    (2005)   (Thomas,   J.,   concurring)\n\n(\"[W]ords such as 'God' have religious significance. . . . Telling\n\neither nonbelievers or believers that the words 'under God' have no\n\nmeaning contradicts what they know to be true.\").\n\n\n\n\n     15\n          Even those who find no Establishment Clause violations\nunder the doctrine of \"ceremonial deism\" do not necessarily deny\nthat the phrase has some religious content. See, e.g., Sherman,\n980 F.2d at 445-47.     Justice Brennan, dissenting in Lynch v.\nDonnelly, 465 U.S. 668 (1984), famously said: \"I would suggest that\nsuch practices as . . . the references to God contained in the\nPledge of Allegiance can best be understood . . . as a form a\n'ceremonial deism,' protected from Establishment Clause scrutiny\nchiefly because they have lost through rote repetition any\nsignificant religious content.\"       Id. at 716 (Brennan, J.,\ndissenting) (footnote omitted). We understand Justice Brennan to\nhave considered the context and circumstances of the usage of the\nphrase.\n\n                                       -11-\n\f            That the phrase \"under God\" has some religious content,\n\nhowever,    is   not    determinative        of    the    New    Hampshire    Act's\n\nconstitutionality.       This is in part because the Constitution does\n\nnot \"require complete separation of church and state.\"                 Lynch, 465\n\nU.S. at 673.         The fact of some religious content is also not\n\ndispositive because there are different degrees of religious and\n\nnon-religious meaning. The Supreme Court has upheld a wide variety\n\nof governmental actions that have some religious content.                         See,\n\ne.g., Van Orden, 545 U.S. at 681 (upholding the display of the Ten\n\nCommandments     on    the   Texas   State    Capitol     grounds);    County       of\n\nAllegheny, 492 U.S. at 578-79 (upholding the display of a Chanukah\n\nmenorah outside a government building); Lynch, 465 U.S. at 670-72\n\n(upholding the display of a Nativity scene in a public Christmas\n\ndisplay); Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 784-86 (1983) (upholding\n\na state legislature's practice of opening each day with a prayer\n\nled by a chaplain paid with state funds).\n\n            The Pledge and the phrase \"under God\" are not themselves\n\nprayers, nor are they readings from or recitations of a sacred text\n\nof   a   religion.      That   fact   does        not   itself   dispose     of    the\n\nconstitutional question either. There are many religiously infused\n\npractices that do not rise to the level of prayer that are clearly\n\nprohibited by the Establishment Clause.                   In the public school\n\ncontext, the Supreme Court has struck down the teaching of creation\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fscience, Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 (1987), and the display\n\nof a Ten Commandments poster, Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39 (1980).\n\n           Special considerations are involved when a claim involves\n\npublic school students.        In the Establishment Clause context,\n\npublic schools are different, in part because the students are not\n\nadults, and in part because a purpose of a public school is to\n\ninculcate values and learning.         \"Recognizing the potential dangers\n\nof school-endorsed religious practice,\" the Supreme Court has\n\n\"shown particular 'vigilan[ce] in monitoring compliance with the\n\nEstablishment Clause in elementary and secondary schools.'\" Bd. of\n\nEduc. of Westside Cmty. Sch. v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 264 (1990)\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting Edwards, 482 U.S. at 583-584).\n\nFor example, while the Court has upheld a state legislature's\n\npractice of opening each day with a prayer led by a chaplain paid\n\nwith state funds, Marsh, 463 U.S. at 784-86, it has repeatedly\n\nfound   that   prayers,   invocations,       and   other   overtly   religious\n\nactivities in public schools violate the Establishment Clause.\n\nSee, e.g., Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290 (2000)\n\n(invalidating    a   school   policy    of   permitting     the   delivery   of\n\nstudent-led prayer before high school football games); Lee, 505\n\nU.S. 577 (invalidating the delivery of an invocation by a member of\n\nthe clergy at graduation ceremonies); Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S.\n\n38 (1985) (invalidating a period of silence for meditation or\n\nvoluntary prayer); Sch. Dist. of Abington Twp. v. Schempp, 374 U.S.\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f203 (1963) (invalidating a required Bible reading before each\n\nschool day); Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421 (1962) (invalidating the\n\nsaying of a daily prayer).\n\n            The question is where along this spectrum of cases falls\n\nthe voluntary, teacher-led recitation of the Pledge, including the\n\nphrase \"under God,\" by pupils in New Hampshire's public schools.\n\nWe   turn   to   the   Court's   different   analytical   measures   for\n\nEstablishment Clause claims.\n\n            1.     The Three-factored Lemon Analysis\n\n            Under the Lemon analysis,16 a court must consider three\n\nfactors: \"First, the statute must have a secular legislative\n\npurpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that\n\nneither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must\n\nnot foster 'an excessive government entanglement with religion.'\"\n\nLemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13 (quoting Walz v. Tax Commission, 397 U.S.\n\n664, 674 (1970)) (citation omitted).         As FFRF does not allege\n\nentanglement, the third prong is not at issue here.\n\n            FFRF concedes that the New Hampshire Act has a secular\n\npurpose--the promotion of patriotism--but insists that this does\n\n\n     16\n           Although the Lemon analysis has been often criticized,\nincluding by members of the Supreme Court, see Freethought Soc.,334\nF.3d at 256 (collecting cases), the Court has never expressly\nrejected it in cases such as this, and we have continued to apply\nit in the First Circuit. See, e.g., Boyajian v. Gatzunis, 212 F.3d\n1, 4 (1st Cir. 2000). The Lemon factors have, in the years since\ntheir first use in 1971, been described as \"no more than helpful\nsign posts.\" Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677, 685 (2005) (quoting\nHunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 741 (1973)).\n\n                                  -14-\n\fnot   end   the    inquiry.   FFRF   argues   that   Congress   had   an\n\nimpermissible religious purpose when it added the words \"under God\"\n\nto the text of the Pledge in 1954, and that this fact must be\n\nconsidered in our analysis.     Even if so, the argument does not go\n\nto the first factor.     We look at the purpose of New Hampshire when\n\nit enacted the statute in 2002, in the aftermath of the tragedy of\n\nSeptember 11, 2001. Because FFRF has stipulated that New Hampshire\n\nhad a secular purpose,17 its claim of impermissible governmental\n\npurpose clearly fails on the first prong of Lemon.\n\n            FFRF argues, under the second factor, that the principal\n\nor primary effect of the New Hampshire Act is the advancement of\n\nreligion.    The Pledge's affirmation that ours is a \"nation, under\n\nGod\" is not a mere reference to the fact that many Americans\n\nbelieve in a deity, nor to the undeniable historical significance\n\nof religion in the founding of our nation.       As the Supreme Court\n\nrecognized in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette,\n\n319 U.S. 624 (1943), to recite the Pledge is to \"declare a belief\"\n\nand \"affirm[] . . . an attitude of mind.\"       Id. at 631, 633.      In\n\nreciting the Pledge, a student affirms a belief in its description\n\nof the nation.18    For this reason, it is unconstitutional under the\n\n\n      17\n          There is no claim that New Hampshire articulated a\npatriotic purpose as a subterfuge meant to avoid First Amendment\nstrictures.\n      18\n          See Douglas Laycock, Theology Scholarships, The Pledge of\nAllegiance, and Religious Liberty: Avoiding the Extremes but\nMissing the Liberty, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 156, 228 (2004) (\"To affirm\n\n                                 -15-\n\fFree Speech Clause to require that students recite the Pledge in\n\npublic schools.   See id. at 642 (\"If there is any fixed star in our\n\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or\n\npetty,   can   prescribe   what   shall    be   orthodox    in    politics,\n\nnationalism,   religion,   or   other    matters   of   opinion   or   force\n\ncitizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\").\n\n          In looking at the effect of the state's creation of a\n\ndaily period for the voluntary recitation of the Pledge, we must\n\nconsider the text as a whole and must take account of context and\n\ncircumstances.    See, e.g., Van Orden, 545 U.S. at 701 (Breyer, J.,\n\nconcurring in the judgment) (“[T]o determine the message that the\n\ntext here conveys, we must examine how the text is used. And that\n\ninquiry requires us to consider the context of the display.”);\n\nCounty of Allegheny, 492 U.S. at 598 (“[T]he effect of a créche\n\ndisplay turns on its setting.”).        It takes more than the presence\n\nof words with religious content to have the effect of advancing\n\nreligion, let alone to do so as a primary effect.\n\n          As to context, there is no claim that a student is\n\nrequired to advance a belief in theism (or monotheism), nor is\n\n\n\n\nthis description necessarily affirms the propositions included in\nthat description: that there is a God, and only one, of such a\nnature that a nation can be under that God.\"). But see Elk Grove,\n542 U.S. at 26 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in the judgment)\n(\"[T]he Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily\non the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description\nof the Nation.\").\n\n                                  -16-\n\fthere any claim that a student is even encouraged by the faculty to\n\nsay the Pledge if the student chooses not to do so.\n\n            By design, the recitation of the Pledge in New Hampshire\n\npublic schools is meant to further \"the policy of teaching our\n\ncountry's history to the elementary and secondary pupils of this\n\nstate.\"   N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 194:15-c.        \"The very purpose of a\n\nnational flag is to serve as a symbol of our country.\"          Elk Grove\n\nUnified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 6 (2004) (quoting Texas\n\nv. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 405 (1989)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    As the Court has observed, \"the Pledge of Allegiance\n\nevolved as a common public acknowledgment of the ideals that our\n\nflag symbolizes.     Its recitation is a patriotic exercise designed\n\nto foster national unity and pride in those principles.\"          Id.    In\n\nreciting the Pledge, students promise fidelity to our flag and our\n\nnation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.\n\n            The New Hampshire School Patriot Act's primary effect is\n\nnot the advancement of religion, but the advancement of patriotism\n\nthrough a pledge to the flag as a symbol of the nation.\n\n            2.      The Endorsement Analysis\n\n            Under   the   related   endorsement   analysis,   courts    must\n\nconsider whether the challenged governmental action has the purpose\n\nor effect of endorsing, favoring, or promoting religion. County of\n\nAllegheny, 492 U.S. at 593-94.       \"The   Establishment Clause, at the\n\nvery least, prohibits government from appearing to take a position\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fon questions of religious belief or from 'making adherence to a\n\nreligion   relevant    in   any    way    to   a   person's   standing     in   the\n\npolitical community.'\"       County of Allegheny, 492 U.S. at 593-94\n\n(quoting Lynch, 465 U.S. at 687 (O'Connor, J., concurring)).                     A\n\npractice in which the state is involved may not \"send[] the\n\nancillary message to members of the audience who are nonadherents\n\n'that   they   are   outsiders,     not   full     members    of   the   political\n\ncommunity, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are\n\ninsiders, favored members of the political community.'\"                  Santa Fe,\n\n530 U.S. at 309-10 (quoting Lynch, 465 U.S. at 688 (O'Connor, J.,\n\nconcurring)).\n\n           At the heart of FFRF's claim is its argument that those\n\nstudents who choose not to recite the Pledge for reasons of non-\n\nbelief in God are quite visibly differentiated from other students\n\nwho stand and participate.         The result, FFRF argues, is that the\n\nrecitation of the Pledge makes the Doe children outsiders to their\n\npeer group on the grounds of their religion.\n\n           FFRF's premise is that children who choose not to recite\n\nthe Pledge become outsiders based on their beliefs about religion.\n\nThat premise is flawed.           Under the New Hampshire Act, both the\n\nchoice to engage in the recitation of the Pledge and the choice not\n\nto do so are entirely voluntary.          The reasons pupils choose not to\n\nparticipate are not themselves obvious.              There are a wide variety\n\nof reasons why students may choose not to recite the Pledge,\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fincluding many reasons that do not rest on either religious or\n\nanti-religious belief.    These include political disagreement with\n\nreciting the Pledge, a desire to be different, a view of our\n\ncountry's history or the significance of the flag that differs from\n\nthat contained in the Pledge, and no reason at all.         Even students\n\nwho agree with the Pledge may choose not to recite the Pledge.\n\nThus, the Doe children are not religiously differentiated from\n\ntheir peers merely by virtue of their non-participation in the\n\nPledge.\n\n          Furthermore, the constitutionality of a state statute\n\ndoes not turn on the subjective feelings of plaintiffs as to\n\nwhether a religious endorsement has occurred.             Rather, in the\n\nendorsement   analysis,   the   court    assumes   the   viewpoint   of   an\n\n\"objective observer acquainted with the text, legislative history,\n\nand implementation of the statute.\"         Santa Fe, 530 U.S. at 308\n\n(quoting Wallace, 472 U.S. at 73, 76 (O'Connor, J., concurring in\n\nthe judgment)).19   Indeed, in a wide      variety of contexts, the law\n\n\n     19\n          Because it makes no difference to the outcome, we need\nnot get into the nuances of which observer is at play: for\ninstance, whether the relevant observer is any adult, the parent,\nthe student, the mature student, or the immature student. There\nare cases in which the Supreme Court has assumed the viewpoint of\na high school student affected by the state action. See, e.g.,\nSanta Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290, 308 (2000)\n(referring to the view of \"an objective Santa Fe High School\nstudent\"); Bd. of Educ. of Westside Cmty. Sch. v. Mergens, 496 U.S.\n226, 249-52 (1990) (referring to an objective observer in the\nposition of a secondary school student). But the Second Circuit\nhas cautioned: \"We cannot conclude that it makes equal sense to\ntreat a first or second grader as the 'objective observer' who can\n\n                                  -19-\n\frejects tests relying on subjectivity and utilizes the analytic\n\ndevice of asking how a reasonable and objective observer would view\n\nthe matter in question.        See, e.g., Capitol Square Review &\n\nAdvisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753, 779-781 (1995) (O'Connor,\n\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\"In this\n\nrespect, the applicable observer is similar to the 'reasonable\n\nperson' in tort law, who 'is not to be identified with any ordinary\n\nindividual, who might occasionally do unreasonable things,' but is\n\n'rather a personification of a community ideal of reasonable\n\nbehavior,   determined   by   the   [collective]   social   judgment.'\")\n\n(quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and\n\nKeeton on Law of Torts 175 (5th ed. 1984)).\n\n            Adopting the view of the objective observer fully aware\n\nof the relevant circumstances, we conclude there has been no\n\nendorsement of religion.      The state legislature passed the New\n\nHampshire Act in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 with the\n\nintent of fostering patriotism, see, e.g., N.H.S. Jour. 945-67\n\n(2002), and that is the statute's effect.      Taken in the context of\n\nthe words of the whole Pledge, the phrase \"under God\" does not\n\nconvey a message of endorsement.\n\n\ntake account of the text, history, and implementation of a\nchallenged policy.\" Skoros v. City of New York, 437 F.3d 1, 23 (2d\nCir. 2006); see also Good News Club v. Milford Cent. Sch., 533 U.S.\n98, 115 (2001) (\"[T]o the extent we consider whether the community\nwould feel coercive pressure to engage in the Club's activities,\nthe relevant community would be the parents, not the elementary\nschool children.\") (internal citation omitted).\n\n                                    -20-\n\f            The importance of context in the endorsement inquiry is\n\nmade clear by two cases in which the Supreme Court has addressed\n\nthe display of crèches at Christmas.     In the first case, Lynch, the\n\nCourt concluded that although a crèche displayed by the city was\n\nitself religious, the fact that it was located in a broader holiday\n\ndisplay clarified to the reasonable observer that the city was, as\n\npart of the holiday, simply acknowledging religion with the crèche\n\nand not endorsing it.   Lynch, 465 U.S. at 679-80.      By contrast, the\n\nCourt in County of Allegheny concluded that a display of a crèche\n\nin a county courthouse with an angel bearing a banner proclaiming\n\n\"Gloria in Excelsis Deo,\" with no surrounding secular objects to\n\nchange the message conveyed, was an unconstitutional endorsement of\n\nreligion.   County of Allegheny, 492 U.S. at 598.\n\n            Along this spectrum, the two word phrase \"under God\" in\n\nthe thirty-one words of the Pledge is much closer to the crèche at\n\nissue in Lynch.   The phrase is surrounded by words that modify its\n\nsignificance--not by changing its meaning, but rather by providing\n\nclarity to the message conveyed and its purpose.            Cf. Lynch, 465\n\nU.S. at 692 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"Although the religious and\n\nindeed   sectarian   significance   of   the   crèche   .    .   .   is   not\n\nneutralized by the setting, the overall holiday setting changes\n\nwhat viewers may fairly understand to be the purpose of the\n\ndisplay.\").    Here, the words \"under God\" appear in a pledge to a\n\n\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fflag--itself a secular exercise, accompanied by no other religious\n\nlanguage or symbolism.\n\n            We reject FFRF's claim of unconstitutional endorsement.\n\n            3.          The Coercion Analysis\n\n            Relying heavily on Lee, FFRF finally argues that the\n\nrecitation       of         the   Pledge       in    public      school     classrooms\n\nunconstitutionally coerces the Doe children to \"recite a purely\n\nreligious ideology.\"\n\n            Lee invalidated a public school's practice of inviting\n\nmembers   of     the    clergy     to    give    a   nonsectarian    prayer    at   its\n\ngraduation     ceremonies.             Lee,    505   U.S.   at   581-82.      Although\n\nattendance at the ceremonies and participation during the prayer\n\nwere voluntary, the Court found that there was indirect pressure on\n\nattending students to stand or maintain respectful silence during\n\nthe prayer, and that because silence during prayer signifies\n\nparticipation, this practice was unconstitutional.                         Id. at 598.\n\nLee held that \"the Constitution guarantees that government may not\n\ncoerce    anyone       to    support    or     participate    in   religion    or   its\n\nexercise.\"     Id. at 587.\n\n            Coercion need not be direct to violate the Establishment\n\nClause, but rather can take the form of \"subtle coercive pressure\"\n\nthat interferes with an individual's \"real choice\" about whether to\n\nparticipate in the activity at issue.                  Lee, 505 U.S. at 592, 595.\n\nIn public schools, this danger of impermissible, indirect coercion\n\n\n                                              -22-\n\fis most pronounced because of the \"young impressionable children\n\nwhose school attendance is statutorily compelled.\"     Schempp, 374\n\nU.S. at 307 (Goldberg, J., concurring).      As Lee stated, \"prayer\n\nexercises in public schools carry a particular risk of indirect\n\ncoercion.     The concern may not be limited to the context of\n\nschools, but it is most pronounced there.\"    Lee, 505 U.S. at 592.\n\n            FFRF contends that the Pledge, while not a prayer, is\n\nmore problematic than the prayer at issue in Lee.    It argues that\n\nthe students in this case are younger and more impressionable; that\n\nthey are led by teachers whom they respect as authorities, rather\n\nthan by a member of the clergy whom they do not know; that those\n\nwho participate are encouraged to verbalize the words, rather than\n\nmerely listen; that the Pledge occurs every day, rather than once\n\nor twice in their school career; that a refusal to participate in\n\nthe recitation of the Pledge is more obvious than refusing to\n\nlisten to a prayer; and that unlike at a graduation ceremony, the\n\nstudents do not have their parents next to them to support them in\n\ntheir non-participation.     These concerns do not make the New\n\nHampshire Act unconstitutional.   At least two factors distinguish\n\nLee from this case.\n\n            First, like other courts that have reviewed the Pledge,\n\nwe think it relevant that the religious content of the phrase \"under\n\n\n\n\n                                -23-\n\fGod\" is couched in a non-religious text.20        This fact is not\n\ndispositive, but it is significant.     It removes the case from the\n\ndirect scope of Lee, where the Court explained: \"These dominant\n\nfacts mark and control the confines of our decision: State officials\n\ndirect the performance of a formal religious exercise . . . .\" Lee,\n\n505 U.S. at 586 (emphasis added).    Recitation of the Pledge is not\n\na formal religious exercise.\n\n           Second, the logic of Lee does not apply directly to the\n\ncase before us.     The Lee finding of unconstitutional coercion can\n\nbe read to result from a three-step analysis involving two premises\n\nand a conclusion.    The Court found that students were being coerced\n\ninto silence during the saying of the prayer; that silence was, in\n\nthe eyes of the community, functionally identical to participation\n\nin the prayer; and that therefore, students were being functionally\n\n\n\n\n     20\n          In addressing the claim that the recitation of a pledge\nof allegiance including the phrase \"under God\" is unconstitutional\nunder Lee, other courts have reasoned that the cases are\nfundamentally different because saying the pledge is not itself a\nreligious exercise. See, e.g., Croft, 2010 WL 3991719, at *10 (\"A\npledge of allegiance to a flag is not a prototypical religious\nactivity.\"); Rio Linda, 597 F.3d at 1038 (\"We agree that the\nstudents in elementary schools are being coerced to listen to the\nother students recite the Pledge. They may even feel induced to\nrecite the Pledge themselves. . . . But the main distinction is\nthis: Here, the students are being coerced to participate in a\npatriotic exercise, not a religious exercise.\"); Myers, 418 F.3d at\n408 (\"The indirect coercion analysis discussed in Lee, Schempp, and\nEngel, simply is not relevant in cases, like this one, challenging\nnon-religious activities. Even assuming that the recitation of the\nPledge contains a risk of indirect coercion, the indirect coercion\nis not threatening to establish religion, but patriotism.\").\n\n                                 -24-\n\fcoerced into participation in the prayer in violation of the\n\nConstitution.21\n\n            A key premise is different here.        While in Lee, \"the act\n\nof standing or remaining silent was an expression of participation\n\nin the rabbi's prayer,\" Lee, 505 U.S. at 593, silence by students\n\nis not an expression of participation in the Pledge.               Rather, a\n\nstudent who remains silent during the saying of the Pledge engages\n\nin overt non-participation by doing so, and this non-participation\n\nis not itself an expression of either religious or non-religious\n\nbelief.\n\n            FFRF's   claim    of    unconstitutional   coercion    under   Lee\n\nfails.\n\nB.          The Pledge Does Not Violate the Free Exercise Clause\n\n            Under the Free Exercise Clause, the government may not\n\n\"(1)   compel   affirmation    of    religious   beliefs;   (2)   punish   the\n\n\n       21\n          See Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 593 (1992) (\"The\nundeniable fact is that the school district's supervision and\ncontrol of a high school graduation ceremony places public\npressure, as well as peer pressure, on attending students to stand\nas a group or, at least, maintain respectful silence during the\ninvocation and benediction. . . . There can be no doubt that for\nmany, if not most, of the students at the graduation, the act of\nstanding or remaining silent was an expression of participation in\nthe rabbi's prayer.    That was the very point of the religious\nexercise. It is of little comfort to a dissenter, then, to be told\nthat for her the act of standing or remaining in silence signifies\nmere respect, rather than participation. What matters is that,\ngiven our social conventions, a reasonable dissenter in this milieu\ncould believe that the group exercise signified her own\nparticipation or approval of it. Finding no violation under these\ncircumstances   would   place   objectors   in   the   dilemma   of\nparticipating, with all that implies, or protesting.\").\n\n                                      -25-\n\fexpression of religious doctrines it believes to be false; (3)\n\nimpose special disabilities on the basis of religious views or\n\nreligious status; or (4) lend its power to one side or the other in\n\ncontroversies over religious authorities or dogma.\"              Parker v.\n\nHurley, 514 F.3d 87, 103 (1st Cir. 2008).           The First Amendment's\n\nprohibition on laws \"prohibiting the free exercise\" of religion is\n\nincorporated   against   the   states    by   the   Fourteenth   Amendment.\n\nCantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940).\n\n           FFRF contends that the recitation of the Pledge in the\n\nDoe children's classrooms violates their ability to freely believe\n\nin atheism or agnosticism, and places an unconstitutional burden on\n\nthe Doe parents' free exercise right to instill their religious\n\nvalues in their children.      This claim is foreclosed by Parker.\n\n           In Parker, we explained that \"[p]ublic schools are not\n\nobliged to shield individual students from ideas which potentially\n\nare religiously offensive, particularly when the school imposes no\n\nrequirement that the student agree with or affirm those ideas, or\n\neven participate in discussions about them.\"          Parker, 514 F.3d at\n\n106. Because the Doe children allege mere exposure to the religious\n\ncontent of the Pledge, they cannot state a claim under the Free\n\nExercise Clause, nor can their parents, as \"the mere fact that a\n\nchild is exposed on occasion in public school to a concept offensive\n\nto a parent's religious belief does not inhibit the parent from\n\ninstructing the child differently.\"       Id. at 105.\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\fC.          The Pledge Does Not Violate the Equal Protection Clause\n\n            Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, the Constitution \"guarantees that those who are similarly\n\nsituated will be treated alike.\" In re Subpoena to Witzel, 531 F.3d\n\n113, 118 (1st Cir. 2008).        Invoking the Equal Protection Clause,\n\nFFRF contends that the School Districts have a duty to show equal\n\nrespect for the Does' atheist and agnostic beliefs, that they are\n\nin breach of this duty by leading students in affirming that God\n\nexists, and that they created a social environment that perpetuates\n\nprejudice   against   atheists    and   agnostics.      However,      the   New\n\nHampshire Act does \"not require different treatment of any class of\n\npeople because of their religious beliefs,\" nor does it \"give\n\npreferential treatment to any particular religion.\"             Wirzburger v.\n\nGalvin, 412 F.3d 271, 283 (1st Cir. 2005).      Rather, as the district\n\ncourt found, \"it applies equally to those who believe in God, those\n\nwho do not, and those who do not have a belief either way, giving\n\nadherents of all persuasions the right to participate or not\n\nparticipate   in   reciting   the   pledge,   for    any   or    no   reason.\"\n\nTherefore, FFRF's equal protection claim fails.\n\nD.          The Pledge Does Not Violate the Due Process Clause\n\n            FFRF's final allegation is that the recitation of the\n\nPledge in the Doe children's classrooms violates the Doe parents'\n\nfundamental constitutional right of parenthood protected by the Due\n\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.          FFRF argues that this\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fright is embraced within the general right of parenthood recognized\n\nby Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000).     Because this claim\n\nis adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by any effort\n\nat developed argumentation, it is waived. United States v. Zannino,\n\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).         In any event, the claim lacks\n\nmerit, as \"the substantive due process clause . . . does not give\n\n[parents] the degree of control over their children's education that\n\ntheir requested relief seeks.\"     Parker, 514 F.3d at 102-03.\n\n                                 III.\n\n             We hold that the New Hampshire School Patriot Act and the\n\nvoluntary, teacher-led recitation of the Pledge by the state's\n\npublic school students do not violate the Constitution.     We affirm\n\nthe order and judgment of the district court dismissing FFRF's\n\ncomplaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\f",

Ann. § 194:15-c (\"the New Hampshire Act\"), which requires that the state's public schools authorize a period during the school day for students to voluntarily participate in the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, violates the First or Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. We hold that the statute is constitutional and affirm entry of judgment for defendants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs are The Freedom From Religion Foundation, its members Jan and Pat Doe, and their three children who attend New Hampshire public schools (collectively \"FFRF\"). Jan and Pat Doe identify themselves as atheist and agnostic, respectively, and their children as either atheist or agnostic. At the time the amended complaint was filed in 2008, the eldest child was in sixth grade and attended a middle school jointly administered by New Hampshire's Hanover and Dresden school districts, while the younger two children were enrolled in a public elementary school operated by the Hanover district. Pursuant to the New Hampshire Act, the Pledge of Allegiance (\"the Pledge\") is routinely recited in the Doe children's classrooms under the leadership of their teachers.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The full text of the New Hampshire Act, enacted in 2002, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>I. As a continuation of the policy of teaching our country's history to the elementary and secondary pupils of this state, this section shall be known as the New Hampshire School Patriot Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>II. A school district shall authorize a period of time during the school day for the recitation of the pledge of allegiance. Pupil participation in the recitation of the pledge of allegiance shall be voluntary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>III. Pupils not participating in the recitation of the pledge of allegiance may silently stand or remain seated but shall be required to respect the rights of those pupils electing to participate. If this paragraph shall be declared to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, the remaining paragraphs in this section shall not be affected, and shall continue in full force and effect.</blockquote>\n<p>N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 194:15-c.</p>\n<p>Several aspects of the statute are worth note. By expressly requiring that student participation in the recitation of the Pledge be voluntary, New Hampshire has created a framework in which a school or educator would violate state law by any actions that rendered student participation involuntary. In addition, the statute allows any student not to participate in the recitation of the Pledge regardless of the student's reasons for non-participation. Those who do not participate may either stand silently or remain seated. The only obligation imposed on non-participants is that they respect the rights of those students electing to participate.</p>\n<p>The New Hampshire Act itself does not identify the words of the Pledge or otherwise specify which words should be used. The parties accept that the words of the Pledge that are used in New Hampshire schools are those codified in federal law: \"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> God,<sup>[2]</sup> indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\" 4 U.S.C. § 4 (\"the federal Pledge statute\"). The Pledge, which dates to 1892,<sup>[3]</sup> was first codified in 1942 to clarify the \"rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America.\" <i>See</i> Act of June 22, 1942, Pub.L. No. 77-623, 56 Stat. 377. The words \"under God\" were added in 1954. <i>See</i> Act of June 14, 1954, Pub.L. No. 83-396, 68 Stat. 249.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The procedural history of the case before us is not complicated. On November 1, 2007, FFRF filed a lawsuit against the United States Congress and United State of America (\"the Federal Defendants\"), the Hanover School District and Dresden School District (\"the School Districts\"), and School Administrative Unit 70.<sup>[5]</sup> FFRF sought a declaration that the federal Pledge statute and the recitation of the Pledge in New Hampshire's public schools violated various provisions of the U.S. Constitution, the New Hampshire Constitution, and federal and state law,<sup>[6]</sup> and requested injunctive relief to ensure the end of these violations.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The State of New Hampshire, the United States of America, and Muriel Cyrusa student in the Hanover School district, joined by a group of other students, five of their parents, and the Knights of Columbus filed motions to intervene to assist in the defense of the New Hampshire Act.<sup>[8]</sup> The court granted these motions.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> On August 7, 2008, the Federal Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the claims against them, which the court granted.<sup>[9]</sup> The constitutionality of the federal Pledge statute, 4 U.S.C. § 4, is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p>FFRF filed an amended complaint on November 17, 2008, naming only the School Districts as defendants. FFRF alleged that the School Districts had or would violate the rights of the Doe children under the First Amendment's Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses; the rights of the Doe parents under the Free Exercise Clause; the rights of both the Doe children and their parents under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses; and the Doe parents' federal constitutional rights of parenthood, as well as the Doe children's concomitant rights.<sup>[10]</sup> The United States, New Hampshire, and Cyrus then renewed their motions to dismiss.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>On September 30, 2009, the district court dismissed all of FFRF's federal claims on their merits,<sup>[12]</sup> and issued a final judgment in favor of the United States, the School Districts, and Cyrus.</p>\n<p>FFRF filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court's dismissal of its federal claims against the School Districts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The issue on appeal is whether the New Hampshire Act requiring that its public schools provide a period for the voluntary recitation of the Pledge violates the Establishment Clause, Free Exercise Clause, Equal Protection Clause, or Due Process Clause. We review de novo the district court's dismissal of FFRF's amended complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), accepting as true all well-pleaded facts in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs' favor. <i>Sutliffe v. Epping Sch. Dist.,</i> 584 F.3d 314, 325 (1st Cir.2009). The issue is one of law.<sup>[13]</sup> No material facts are in dispute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Pledge Does not Violate the Establishment Clause</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under the Establishment Clause, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" U.S. Const. amend. I. Although applicable originally only against the federal government, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> Establishment Clause was incorporated to apply to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Everson v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 330 U.S. 1, 8, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947).</p>\n<p>In determining whether a law runs afoul of this prohibition, the Supreme Court has articulated three interrelated analytical approaches: the three-prong analysis set forth in <i>Lemon v. Kurtzman,</i> 403 U.S. 602, 612-13, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971); the \"endorsement\" analysis, first articulated by Justice O'Connor in her concurrence in <i>Lynch v. Donnelly,</i> 465 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 79 L.Ed.2d 604 (1984), and applied by a majority of the Court in <i>County of Allegheny v. ACLU,</i> 492 U.S. 573, 109 S.Ct. 3086, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (1989); and the \"coercion\" analysis of <i>Lee v. Weisman,</i> 505 U.S. 577, 587, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992).<sup>[14]</sup> Before applying the three approaches to the case before us, we first address a few general matters.</p>\n<p>FFRF's argument is that the School Districts' Pledge practices pursuant to the New Hampshire Act are religious for purposes of the First Amendment because the Pledge itself is a religious exercise in that it uses the phrase \"under God.\" FFRF argues that despite the voluntary nature of any student participation in the Pledge, the result is nonetheless the establishment by the state of religion.</p>\n<p>As to the first part of the argument, we begin with the unremarkable proposition that the phrase \"under God\" has some religious content. In our view, mere repetition of the phrase in secular ceremonies does not by itself deplete the phrase of all religious content.<sup>[15]</sup> A belief in God is a religious belief. That the phrase has some religious content is demonstrated by the fact that those who are religious, as well as those who are not, could reasonably be offended by the claim that it does not. <i>See </i><i>Myers v. Loudoun County Pub. Sch.,</i> 418 F.3d 395, 407 (4th Cir.2005) (\"Undoubtedly, the Pledge contains a religious phrase, and it is demeaning to persons of any faith to assert that the words `under God' contain no religious significance.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Van Orden v. Perry,</i> 545 U.S. 677, 695-96, 125 S.Ct. 2854, 162 L.Ed.2d 607 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring) (\"[W]ords such as `God' have religious significance.... Telling either nonbelievers or believers that the words `under God' have no meaning contradicts what they know to be true.\").</p>\n<p>That the phrase \"under God\" has some religious content, however, is not determinative of the New Hampshire Act's constitutionality. This is in part because the Constitution does not \"require complete separation of church and state.\" <i>Lynch,</i> 465 U.S. at 673, 104 S.Ct. 1355. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> The fact of some religious content is also not dispositive because there are different degrees of religious and non-religious meaning. The Supreme Court has upheld a wide variety of governmental actions that have some religious content. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Van Orden,</i> 545 U.S. at 681, 125 S.Ct. 2854 (upholding the display of the Ten Commandments on the Texas State Capitol grounds); <i>County of Allegheny,</i> 492 U.S. at 578-79, 109 S.Ct. 3086 (upholding the display of a Chanukah menorah outside a government building); <i>Lynch,</i> 465 U.S. at 670-72, 104 S.Ct. 1355 (upholding the display of a Nativity scene in a public Christmas display); <i>Marsh v. Chambers,</i> 463 U.S. 783, 784-86, 103 S.Ct. 3330, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983) (upholding a state legislature's practice of opening each day with a prayer led by a chaplain paid with state funds).</p>\n<p>The Pledge and the phrase \"under God\" are not themselves prayers, nor are they readings from or recitations of a sacred text of a religion. That fact does not itself dispose of the constitutional question either. There are many religiously infused practices that do not rise to the level of prayer that are clearly prohibited by the Establishment Clause. In the public school context, the Supreme Court has struck down the teaching of creation science, <i>Edwards v. Aguillard,</i> 482 U.S. 578, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 96 L.Ed.2d 510 (1987), and the display of a Ten Commandments poster, <i>Stone v. Graham,</i> 449 U.S. 39, 101 S.Ct. 192, 66 L.Ed.2d 199 (1980).</p>\n<p>Special considerations are involved when a claim involves public school students. In the Establishment Clause context, public schools are different, in part because the students are not adults, and in part because a purpose of a public school is to inculcate values and learning. \"Recognizing the potential dangers of school-endorsed religious practice,\" the Supreme Court has \"shown particular `vigilan[ce] in monitoring compliance with the Establishment Clause in elementary and secondary schools.'\" <i>Bd. of Educ. of Westside Cmty. Sch. v. Mergens,</i> 496 U.S. 226, 264, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990) (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Edwards,</i> 482 U.S. at 583-584, 107 S.Ct. 2573). For example, while the Court has upheld a state legislature's practice of opening each day with a prayer led by a chaplain paid with state funds, <i>Marsh,</i> 463 U.S. at 784-86, 103 S.Ct. 3330, it has repeatedly found that prayers, invocations, and other overtly religious activities in public schools violate the Establishment Clause. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Doe,</i> 530 U.S. 290, 120 S.Ct. 2266, 147 L.Ed.2d 295 (2000) (invalidating a school policy of permitting the delivery of student-led prayer before high school football games); <i>Lee,</i> 505 U.S. 577, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (invalidating the delivery of an invocation by a member of the clergy at graduation ceremonies); <i>Wallace v. Jaffree,</i> 472 U.S. 38, 105 S.Ct. 2479, 86 L.Ed.2d 29 (1985) (invalidating a period of silence for meditation or voluntary prayer); <i>Sch. Dist. of Abington Twp. v. Schempp,</i> 374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963) (invalidating a required Bible reading before each school day); <i>Engel v. Vitale,</i> 370 U.S. 421, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1962) (invalidating the saying of a daily prayer).</p>\n<p>The question is where along this spectrum of cases falls the voluntary, teacher-led recitation of the Pledge, including the phrase \"under God,\" by pupils in New Hampshire's public schools. We turn to the Court's different analytical measures for Establishment Clause claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The Three-Factored Lemon Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> Under the <i>Lemon</i> analysis,<sup>[16]</sup> a court must consider three factors: \"First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster `an excessive government entanglement with religion.'\" <i>Lemon,</i> 403 U.S. at 612-13, 91 S.Ct. 2105 (quoting <i>Walz v. Tax Commission,</i> 397 U.S. 664, 674, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970)) (citation omitted). As FFRF does not allege entanglement, the third prong is not at issue here.</p>\n<p>FFRF concedes that the New Hampshire Act has a secular purposethe promotion of patriotismbut insists that this does not end the inquiry. FFRF argues that Congress had an impermissible religious purpose when it added the words \"under God\" to the text of the Pledge in 1954, and that this fact must be considered in our analysis. Even if so, the argument does not go to the first factor. We look at the purpose of New Hampshire when it enacted the statute in 2002, in the aftermath of the tragedy of September 11, 2001. Because FFRF has stipulated that New Hampshire had a secular purpose,<sup>[17]</sup> its claim of impermissible governmental purpose clearly fails on the first prong of <i>Lemon.</i></p>\n<p>FFRF argues, under the second factor, that the principal or primary effect of the New Hampshire Act is the advancement of religion. The Pledge's affirmation that ours is a \"nation, under God\" is not a mere reference to the fact that many Americans believe in a deity, nor to the undeniable historical significance of religion in the founding of our nation. As the Supreme Court recognized in <i>West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette,</i> 319 U.S. 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943), to recite the Pledge is to \"declare a belief\" and \"affirm[] ... an attitude of mind.\" <i>Id.</i> at 631, 633, 63 S.Ct. 1178. In reciting the Pledge, a student affirms a belief in its description of the nation.<sup>[18]</sup> For this reason, it is unconstitutional under the Free Speech Clause to <i>require</i> that students recite the Pledge in public schools. <i>See id.</i> at 642, 63 S.Ct. 1178 (\"If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> In looking at the effect of the state's creation of a daily period for the voluntary recitation of the Pledge, we must consider the text as a whole and must take account of context and circumstances. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Van Orden,</i> 545 U.S. at 701, 125 S.Ct. 2854 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment) (\"[T]o determine the message that the text here conveys, we must examine how the text is <i>used.</i> And that inquiry requires us to consider the context of the display.\"); <i>County of Allegheny,</i> 492 U.S. at 598, 109 S.Ct. 3086 (\"[T]he effect of a créche display turns on its setting.\"). It takes more than the presence of words with religious content to have the effect of advancing religion, let alone to do so as a primary effect.</p>\n<p>As to context, there is no claim that a student is required to advance a belief in theism (or monotheism), nor is there any claim that a student is even encouraged by the faculty to say the Pledge if the student chooses not to do so.</p>\n<p>By design, the recitation of the Pledge in New Hampshire public schools is meant to further \"the policy of teaching our country's history to the elementary and secondary pupils of this state.\" N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 194:15-c. \"The very purpose of a national flag is to serve as a symbol of our country.\" <i>Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow,</i> 542 U.S. 1, 6, 124 S.Ct. 2301, 159 L.Ed.2d 98 (2004) (quoting <i>Texas v. Johnson,</i> 491 U.S. 397, 405, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989)) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Court has observed, \"the Pledge of Allegiance evolved as a common public acknowledgment of the ideals that our flag symbolizes. Its recitation is a patriotic exercise designed to foster national unity and pride in those principles.\" <i>Id.</i> In reciting the Pledge, students promise fidelity to our flag and our nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.</p>\n<p>The New Hampshire School Patriot Act's primary effect is not the advancement of religion, but the advancement of patriotism through a pledge to the flag as a symbol of the nation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The Endorsement Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under the related endorsement analysis, courts must consider whether the challenged governmental action has the purpose or effect of endorsing, favoring, or promoting religion. <i>County of Allegheny,</i> 492 U.S. at 593-94, 109 S.Ct. 3086. \"The Establishment Clause, at the very least, prohibits government from appearing to take a position on questions of religious belief or from `making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person's standing in the political community.'\" <i>County of Allegheny,</i> 492 U.S. at 593-94, 109 S.Ct. 3086 (quoting <i>Lynch,</i> 465 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 1355 (O'Connor, J., concurring)). A practice in which the state is involved may not \"send[] the ancillary message to members of the audience who are nonadherents `that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.'\" <i>Santa Fe,</i> 530 U.S. at 309-10, 120 S.Ct. 2266 (quoting <i>Lynch,</i> 465 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 1355 (O'Connor, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p>At the heart of FFRF's claim is its argument that those students who choose not to recite the Pledge for reasons of non-belief in God are quite visibly differentiated from other students who stand and participate. The result, FFRF argues, is that the recitation of the Pledge makes the Doe children outsiders to their peer group on the grounds of their religion.</p>\n<p>FFRF's premise is that children who choose not to recite the Pledge become outsiders based on their beliefs about religion. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> That premise is flawed. Under the New Hampshire Act, both the choice to engage in the recitation of the Pledge and the choice not to do so are entirely voluntary. The reasons pupils choose not to participate are not themselves obvious. There are a wide variety of reasons why students may choose not to recite the Pledge, including many reasons that do not rest on either religious or anti-religious belief. These include political disagreement with reciting the Pledge, a desire to be different, a view of our country's history or the significance of the flag that differs from that contained in the Pledge, and no reason at all. Even students who agree with the Pledge may choose not to <i>recite</i> the Pledge. Thus, the Doe children are not <i>religiously</i> differentiated from their peers merely by virtue of their non-participation in the Pledge.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the constitutionality of a state statute does not turn on the <i>subjective</i> feelings of plaintiffs as to whether a religious endorsement has occurred. Rather, in the endorsement analysis, the court assumes the viewpoint of an \"objective observer acquainted with the text, legislative history, and implementation of the statute.\" <i>Santa Fe,</i> 530 U.S. at 308, 120 S.Ct. 2266 (quoting <i>Wallace,</i> 472 U.S. at 73, 76, 105 S.Ct. 2479 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment)).<sup>[19]</sup> Indeed, in a wide variety of contexts, the law rejects tests relying on subjectivity and utilizes the analytic device of asking how a reasonable and objective observer would view the matter in question. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Capitol Square Review &amp; Advisory Bd. v. Pinette,</i> 515 U.S. 753, 779-781, 115 S.Ct. 2440, 132 L.Ed.2d 650 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\"In this respect, the applicable observer is similar to the `reasonable person' in tort law, who `is not to be identified with any ordinary individual, who might occasionally do unreasonable things,' but is `rather a personification of a community ideal of reasonable behavior, determined by the [collective] social judgment.'\") (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, <i>Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts</i> 175 (5th ed.1984)).</p>\n<p>Adopting the view of the objective observer fully aware of the relevant circumstances, we conclude there has been no endorsement of religion. The state legislature passed the New Hampshire Act in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 with the intent of fostering patriotism, <i>see, e.g.,</i> N.H.S. Jour. 945-67 (2002), and that is the statute's effect. Taken in the context of the words of the whole Pledge, the phrase \"under God\" does not convey a message of endorsement.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> The importance of context in the endorsement inquiry is made clear by two cases in which the Supreme Court has addressed the display of crèches at Christmas. In the first case, <i>Lynch,</i> the Court concluded that although a crèche displayed by the city was itself religious, the fact that it was located in a broader holiday display clarified to the reasonable observer that the city was, as part of the holiday, simply acknowledging religion with the crèche and not endorsing it. <i>Lynch,</i> 465 U.S. at 679-80, 104 S.Ct. 1355. By contrast, the Court in <i>County of Allegheny</i> concluded that a display of a crèche in a county courthouse with an angel bearing a banner proclaiming \"Gloria in Excelsis Deo,\" with no surrounding secular objects to change the message conveyed, was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. <i>County of Allegheny,</i> 492 U.S. at 598, 109 S.Ct. 3086.</p>\n<p>Along this spectrum, the two word phrase \"under God\" in the thirty-one words of the Pledge is much closer to the crèche at issue in <i>Lynch.</i> The phrase is surrounded by words that modify its significancenot by changing its meaning, but rather by providing clarity to the message conveyed and its purpose. <i>Cf. </i><i>Lynch,</i> 465 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. 1355 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"Although the religious and indeed sectarian significance of the crèche ... is not neutralized by the setting, the overall holiday setting changes what viewers may fairly understand to be the purpose of the display.\"). Here, the words \"under God\" appear in a pledge to a flagitself a secular exercise, accompanied by no other religious language or symbolism.</p>\n<p>We reject FFRF's claim of unconstitutional endorsement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>The Coercion Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Relying heavily on <i>Lee,</i> FFRF finally argues that the recitation of the Pledge in public school classrooms unconstitutionally <i>coerces</i> the Doe children to \"recite a purely religious ideology.\"</p>\n<p><i>Lee</i> invalidated a public school's practice of inviting members of the clergy to give a nonsectarian prayer at its graduation ceremonies. <i>Lee,</i> 505 U.S. at 581-82, 112 S.Ct. 2649. Although attendance at the ceremonies and participation during the prayer were voluntary, the Court found that there was indirect pressure on attending students to stand or maintain respectful silence during the prayer, and that because silence during prayer signifies participation, this practice was unconstitutional. <i>Id.</i> at 598, 112 S.Ct. 2649. <i>Lee</i> held that \"the Constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise.\" <i>Id.</i> at 587, 112 S.Ct. 2649.</p>\n<p>Coercion need not be direct to violate the Establishment Clause, but rather can take the form of \"subtle coercive pressure\" that interferes with an individual's \"real choice\" about whether to participate in the activity at issue. <i>Lee,</i> 505 U.S. at 592, 595, 112 S.Ct. 2649. In public schools, this danger of impermissible, indirect coercion is most pronounced because of the \"young impressionable children whose school attendance is statutorily compelled.\" <i>Schempp,</i> 374 U.S. at 307, 83 S.Ct. 1560 (Goldberg, J., concurring). As <i>Lee</i> stated, \"prayer exercises in public schools carry a particular risk of indirect coercion. The concern may not be limited to the context of schools, but it is most pronounced there.\" <i>Lee,</i> 505 U.S. at 592, 112 S.Ct. 2649.</p>\n<p>FFRF contends that the Pledge, while not a prayer, is more problematic than the prayer at issue in <i>Lee.</i> It argues that the students in this case are younger and more impressionable; that they are led by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> teachers whom they respect as authorities, rather than by a member of the clergy whom they do not know; that those who participate are encouraged to verbalize the words, rather than merely listen; that the Pledge occurs every day, rather than once or twice in their school career; that a refusal to participate in the recitation of the Pledge is more obvious than refusing to listen to a prayer; and that unlike at a graduation ceremony, the students do not have their parents next to them to support them in their non-participation. These concerns do not make the New Hampshire Act unconstitutional. At least two factors distinguish <i>Lee</i> from this case.</p>\n<p>First, like other courts that have reviewed the Pledge, we think it relevant that the religious content of the phrase \"under God\" is couched in a non-religious text.<sup>[20]</sup> This fact is not dispositive, but it is significant. It removes the case from the direct scope of <i>Lee,</i> where the Court explained: \"These dominant facts mark and <i>control the confines</i> of our decision: State officials direct the performance of a <i>formal religious exercise....\" </i><i>Lee,</i> 505 U.S. at 586, 112 S.Ct. 2649 (emphasis added). Recitation of the Pledge is not a formal religious exercise.</p>\n<p>Second, the logic of <i>Lee</i> does not apply directly to the case before us. The <i>Lee</i> finding of unconstitutional coercion can be read to result from a three-step analysis involving two premises and a conclusion. The Court found that students were being coerced into silence during the saying of the prayer; that silence was, in the eyes of the community, functionally identical to participation in the prayer; and that therefore, students were being functionally coerced into participation in the prayer in violation of the Constitution.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p>A key premise is different here. While in <i>Lee,</i> \"the act of standing or remaining silent was an expression of participation in the rabbi's prayer,\" <i>Lee,</i> 505 U.S. at 593, 112 S.Ct. 2649, silence by students is not an expression of participation in the Pledge. Rather, a student who remains <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> silent during the saying of the Pledge engages in overt non-participation by doing so, and this non-participation is not itself an expression of either religious or non-religious belief.</p>\n<p>FFRF's claim of unconstitutional coercion under <i>Lee</i> fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Pledge Does Not Violate the Free Exercise Clause</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under the Free Exercise Clause, the government may not \"(1) compel affirmation of religious beliefs; (2) punish the expression of religious doctrines it believes to be false; (3) impose special disabilities on the basis of religious views or religious status; or (4) lend its power to one side or the other in controversies over religious authorities or dogma.\" <i>Parker v. Hurley,</i> 514 F.3d 87, 103 (1st Cir.2008). The First Amendment's prohibition on laws \"prohibiting the free exercise\" of religion is incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Cantwell v. Connecticut,</i> 310 U.S. 296, 303, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940).</p>\n<p>FFRF contends that the recitation of the Pledge in the Doe children's classrooms violates their ability to freely believe in atheism or agnosticism, and places an unconstitutional burden on the Doe parents' free exercise right to instill their religious values in their children. This claim is foreclosed by <i>Parker.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Parker,</i> we explained that \"[p]ublic schools are not obliged to shield individual students from ideas which potentially are religiously offensive, particularly when the school imposes no requirement that the student agree with or affirm those ideas, or even participate in discussions about them.\" <i>Parker,</i> 514 F.3d at 106. Because the Doe children allege mere exposure to the religious content of the Pledge, they cannot state a claim under the Free Exercise Clause, nor can their parents, as \"the mere fact that a child is exposed on occasion in public school to a concept offensive to a parent's religious belief does not inhibit the parent from instructing the child differently.\" <i>Id.</i> at 105.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Pledge Does Not Violate the Equal Protection Clause</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Constitution \"guarantees that those who are similarly situated will be treated alike.\" <i>In re Subpoena to Witzel,</i> 531 F.3d 113, 118 (1st Cir.2008). Invoking the Equal Protection Clause, FFRF contends that the School Districts have a duty to show equal respect for the Does' atheist and agnostic beliefs, that they are in breach of this duty by leading students in affirming that God exists, and that they created a social environment that perpetuates prejudice against atheists and agnostics. However, the New Hampshire Act does \"not require different treatment of any class of people because of their religious beliefs,\" nor does it \"give preferential treatment to any particular religion.\" <i>Wirzburger v. Galvin,</i> 412 F.3d 271, 283 (1st Cir.2005). Rather, as the district court found, \"it applies equally to those who believe in God, those who do not, and those who do not have a belief either way, giving adherents of all persuasions the right to participate or not participate in reciting the pledge, for any or no reason.\" <i>Freedom From Religion Found. v. Hanover Sch. Dist.,</i> 665 F.Supp.2d 58, 72 (D.N.H.2009). Therefore, FFRF's equal protection claim fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>The Pledge Does Not Violate the Due Process Clause</i>\n</h2>\n<p>FFRF's final allegation is that the recitation of the Pledge in the Doe children's classrooms violates the Doe parents' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> fundamental constitutional right of parenthood protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. FFRF argues that this right is embraced within the general right of parenthood recognized by <i>Troxel v. Granville,</i> 530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000). Because this claim is adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by any effort at developed argumentation, it is waived. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990). In any event, the claim lacks merit, as \"the substantive due process clause ... does not give [parents] the degree of control over their children's education that their requested relief seeks.\" <i>Parker,</i> 514 F.3d at 102-03.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We hold that the New Hampshire School Patriot Act and the voluntary, teacher-led recitation of the Pledge by the state's public school students do not violate the Constitution. We affirm the order and judgment of the district court dismissing FFRF's complaint.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  FFRF alleges that the Doe children \"have all been led by their public school teachers in recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance.\" First Am. Complt. ¶ 43, ECF No. 52. New Hampshire has not contested this. The parties have not provided any other specific information about the operation of the statute such as the procedures used or the number of students who participate.</p>\n<p>[2]  Throughout the opinion, we refer to \"God\" as used in the text of the Pledge.</p>\n<p>[3]  In 1892, as part of the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's discovery of America, a national magazine for youth proposed that students in school recite the following affirmation: \"I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands: one Nation indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all.\" <i>Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow,</i> 542 U.S. 1, 6, 124 S.Ct. 2301, 159 L.Ed.2d 98 (2004) (citing J. Baer, <i>The Pledge of Allegiance: A Centennial History, 1892-1992,</i> at 3 (1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[4]  The taking of a pledge of allegiance pre-dates Christianity. Certain Athenian males, at puberty, took a longer pledge, the opening three sentences of which were: \"We will never bring disgrace to this, our city, by any act of dishonesty or cowardice, nor ever desert our suffering comrades in ranks. We will fight for the ideals and sacred things of the city, both alone and with many; we will revere and obey the city's law and do our best to incite a like respect and reverence in those above us who are prone to annul and set them at naught. We will strive unceasingly to quicken the public's sense of civic duty, that thus, in all these ways, we will transmit this city not only not less, but greater, better, and more beautiful than it was transmitted to us.\" <i>Pledge of Allegiance,</i> Lapham's Quarterly, Fall 2010, at 98.</p>\n<p>[5]  FFRF's claim against School Administrative Unit 70, which controls the high schools that the Doe children will eventually attend, was dropped in the amended complaint.</p>\n<p>[6]  Specifically, FFRF sought a declaration that Congress violated the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses in passing the Act of 1954, which added the words \"under God\" to the Pledge; that the words \"under God\" in the Pledge violated the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment, and The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA); and that the School Districts, in having their agents lead the recitation of the Pledge, violated the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the RFRA, Article 6 of the New Hampshire Constitution, and other provisions of New Hampshire state law.</p>\n<p>[7]  FFRF asked the court to \"demand\" that Congress act to remove the words \"under God\" from 4 U.S.C. § 4; that the United States use its power to remove the words \"under God\" from 4 U.S.C. § 4; and that the School Districts cease and desist using the Pledge.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although the United States was already a defendant with respect to FFRF's claim that 4 U.S.C. § 4 is unconstitutional on its face, it was not a defendant with respect to FFRF's claims challenging the recitation of the Pledge in New Hampshire schools, and it therefore moved to intervene as a defendant against what it took to be an as-applied challenge to 4 U.S.C. § 4. While the district court allowed the United State to intervene, it ultimately rejected the argument that the federal statute was being \"applied,\" as the statute merely prescribes the text of the Pledge and does not command any person to recite it or lead others in its recitation.</p>\n<p>[9]  The Federal Defendants' motion also requested dismissal of the claims against the School Districts on the grounds that FFRF failed to state a claim, but this part of the motion was denied, as the School Districts had not filed a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>[10]  FFRF also advanced a variety of state law claims that are not before us on appeal.</p>\n<p>[11]  The district court construed these motions to dismiss as having been advanced by the School Districts as well.</p>\n<p>[12]  Having done so, the court found that principles of comity counseled in favor of not exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims and dismissed the state claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p>[13]  Every federal circuit court that has addressed a state pledge statute has rejected the claim of unconstitutionality. <i>See </i><i>Croft v. Perry,</i> 624 F.3d 157 (5th Cir.2010); <i>Newdow v. Rio Linda Union Sch. Dist.,</i> 597 F.3d 1007 (9th Cir.2010); <i>Myers v. Loudoun County Pub. Sch.,</i> 418 F.3d 395 (4th Cir.2005); <i>Sherman v. Cmty. Consol. Sch. Dist. 21,</i> 980 F.2d 437 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>[14]  There is an abundance of commentary from courts and others as to the relationship between these three analytical approaches. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Freethought Soc. of Greater Philadelphia v. Chester County,</i> 334 F.3d 247, 256-62 (3rd Cir.2003); <i>Mellen v. Bunting,</i> 327 F.3d 355, 370-71 (4th Cir.2003); <i>Adland v. Russ,</i> 307 F.3d 471, 479 (6th Cir.2002). We bypass the question.</p>\n<p>[15]  Even those who find no Establishment Clause violations under the doctrine of \"ceremonial deism\" do not necessarily deny that the phrase has some religious content. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sherman,</i> 980 F.2d at 445-47. Justice Brennan, dissenting in <i>Lynch v. Donnelly,</i> 465 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 79 L.Ed.2d 604 (1984), famously said: \"I would suggest that such practices as ... the references to God contained in the Pledge of Allegiance can best be understood ... as a form a `ceremonial deism,' protected from Establishment Clause scrutiny chiefly because they have lost through rote repetition any significant religious content.\" <i>Id.</i> at 716, 104 S.Ct. 1355 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted). We understand Justice Brennan to have considered the context and circumstances of the usage of the phrase.</p>\n<p>[16]  Although the <i>Lemon</i> analysis has been often criticized, including by members of the Supreme Court, <i>see </i><i>Freethought Soc.,</i> 334 F.3d at 256 (collecting cases), the Court has never expressly rejected it in cases such as this, and we have continued to apply it in the First Circuit. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Boyajian v. Gatzunis,</i> 212 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2000). The <i>Lemon</i> factors have, in the years since their first use in 1971, been described as \"no more than helpful sign posts.\" <i>Van Orden v. Perry,</i> 545 U.S. 677, 685, 125 S.Ct. 2854, 162 L.Ed.2d 607 (2005) (quoting <i>Hunt v. McNair,</i> 413 U.S. 734, 741, 93 S.Ct. 2868, 37 L.Ed.2d 923 (1973)).</p>\n<p>[17]  There is no claim that New Hampshire articulated a patriotic purpose as a subterfuge meant to avoid First Amendment strictures.</p>\n<p>[18]  <i>See</i> Douglas Laycock, <i>Theology Scholarships, The Pledge of Allegiance, and Religious Liberty: Avoiding the Extremes but Missing the Liberty,</i> 118 Harv. L.Rev. 156, 228 (2004) (\"To affirm this description necessarily affirms the propositions included in that description: that there is a God, and only one, of such a nature that a nation can be under that God.\"). <i>But see </i><i>Elk Grove,</i> 542 U.S. at 26, 124 S.Ct. 2301 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in the judgment) (\"[T]he Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description of the Nation.\").</p>\n<p>[19]  Because it makes no difference to the outcome, we need not get into the nuances of which observer is at play: for instance, whether the relevant observer is any adult, the parent, the student, the mature student, or the immature student. There are cases in which the Supreme Court has assumed the viewpoint of a high school student affected by the state action. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Doe,</i> 530 U.S. 290, 308, 120 S.Ct. 2266, 147 L.Ed.2d 295 (2000) (referring to the view of \"an objective Santa Fe High School student\"); <i>Bd. of Educ. of Westside Cmty. Sch. v. Mergens,</i> 496 U.S. 226, 249-52, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990) (referring to an objective observer in the position of a secondary school student). But the Second Circuit has cautioned: \"We cannot conclude that it makes equal sense to treat a first or second grader as the `objective observer' who can take account of the text, history, and implementation of a challenged policy.\" <i>Skoros v. City of New York,</i> 437 F.3d 1, 23 (2d Cir.2006); <i>see also </i><i>Good News Club v. Milford Cent. Sch.,</i> 533 U.S. 98, 115, 121 S.Ct. 2093, 150 L.Ed.2d 151 (2001) (\"[T]o the extent we consider whether the community would feel coercive pressure to engage in the Club's activities, the relevant community would be the parents, not the elementary school children.\") (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p>[20]  In addressing the claim that the recitation of a pledge of allegiance including the phrase \"under God\" is unconstitutional under <i>Lee,</i> other courts have reasoned that the cases are fundamentally different because saying such a pledge is not itself a religious exercise. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Croft,</i> 624 F.3d 157, 170 (\"A pledge of allegiance to a flag is not a prototypical religious activity.\"); <i>Rio Linda,</i> 597 F.3d at 1038 (\"We agree that the students in elementary schools are being coerced to listen to the other students recite the Pledge. They may even feel induced to recite the Pledge themselves.... But the main distinction is this: Here, the students are being coerced to participate in a patriotic exercise, not a religious exercise.\"); <i>Myers,</i> 418 F.3d at 408 (\"The indirect coercion analysis discussed in <i>Lee, Schempp,</i> and <i>Engel,</i> simply is not relevant in cases, like this one, challenging non-religious activities. Even assuming that the recitation of the Pledge contains a risk of indirect coercion, the indirect coercion is not threatening to establish religion, but patriotism.\").</p>\n<p>[21]  <i>See </i><i>Lee v. Weisman,</i> 505 U.S. 577, 593, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992) (\"The undeniable fact is that the school district's supervision and control of a high school graduation ceremony places public pressure, as well as peer pressure, on attending students to stand as a group or, at least, maintain respectful silence during the invocation and benediction.... There can be no doubt that for many, if not most, of the students at the graduation, the act of standing or remaining silent was an expression of participation in the rabbi's prayer. That was the very point of the religious exercise. It is of little comfort to a dissenter, then, to be told that for her the act of standing or remaining in silence signifies mere respect, rather than participation. What matters is that, given our social conventions, a reasonable dissenter in this milieu could believe that the group exercise signified her own participation or approval of it. Finding no violation under these circumstances would place objectors in the dilemma of participating, with all that implies, or protesting.\").</p>\n\n</div>",

Ann. § 194:15-c (\"the New Hampshire Act\"), which requires that the state's public schools authorize a period during the school day for students to voluntarily participate in the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, violates the First or Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. We hold that the statute is constitutional and affirm entry of judgment for defendants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs are The Freedom From Religion Foundation, its members Jan and Pat Doe, and their three children who attend New Hampshire public schools (collectively \"FFRF\"). Jan and Pat Doe identify themselves as atheist and agnostic, respectively, and their children as either atheist or agnostic. At the time the amended complaint was filed in 2008, the eldest child was in sixth grade and attended a middle school jointly administered by New Hampshire's Hanover and Dresden school districts, while the younger two children were enrolled in a public elementary school operated by the Hanover district. Pursuant to the New Hampshire Act, the Pledge of Allegiance (\"the Pledge\") is routinely recited in the Doe children's classrooms under the leadership of their teachers.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The full text of the New Hampshire Act, enacted in 2002, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>I. As a continuation of the policy of teaching our country's history to the elementary and secondary pupils of this state, this section shall be known as the New Hampshire School Patriot Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>II. A school district shall authorize a period of time during the school day for the recitation of the pledge of allegiance. Pupil participation in the recitation of the pledge of allegiance shall be voluntary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>III. Pupils not participating in the recitation of the pledge of allegiance may silently stand or remain seated but shall be required to respect the rights of those pupils electing to participate. If this paragraph shall be declared to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, the remaining paragraphs in this section shall not be affected, and shall continue in full force and effect.</blockquote>\n<p>N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 194:15-c.</p>\n<p>Several aspects of the statute are worth note. By expressly requiring that student participation in the recitation of the Pledge be voluntary, New Hampshire has created a framework in which a school or educator would violate state law by any actions that rendered student participation involuntary. In addition, the statute allows any student not to participate in the recitation of the Pledge regardless of the student's reasons for non-participation. Those who do not participate may either stand silently or remain seated. The only obligation imposed on non-participants is that they respect the rights of those students electing to participate.</p>\n<p>The New Hampshire Act itself does not identify the words of the Pledge or otherwise specify which words should be used. The parties accept that the words of the Pledge that are used in New Hampshire schools are those codified in federal law: \"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> God,<sup>[2]</sup> indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\" 4 U.S.C. § 4 (\"the federal Pledge statute\"). The Pledge, which dates to 1892,<sup>[3]</sup> was first codified in 1942 to clarify the \"rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America.\" <i>See</i> Act of June 22, 1942, Pub.L. No. 77-623, 56 Stat. 377. The words \"under God\" were added in 1954. <i>See</i> Act of June 14, 1954, Pub.L.

On November 1, 2007, FFRF filed a lawsuit against the United States Congress and United State of America (\"the Federal Defendants\"), the Hanover School District and Dresden School District (\"the School Districts\"), and School Administrative Unit 70.<sup>[5]</sup> FFRF sought a declaration that the federal Pledge statute and the recitation of the Pledge in New Hampshire's public schools violated various provisions of the U.S. Constitution, the New Hampshire Constitution, and federal and state law,<sup>[6]</sup> and requested injunctive relief to ensure the end of these violations.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The State of New Hampshire, the United States of America, and Muriel Cyrusa student in the Hanover School district, joined by a group of other students, five of their parents, and the Knights of Columbus filed motions to intervene to assist in the defense of the New Hampshire Act.<sup>[8]</sup> The court granted these motions.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> On August 7, 2008, the Federal Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the claims against them, which the court granted.<sup>[9]</sup> The constitutionality of the federal Pledge statute, 4 U.S.C. § 4, is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p>FFRF filed an amended complaint on November 17, 2008, naming only the School Districts as defendants. FFRF alleged that the School Districts had or would violate the rights of the Doe children under the First Amendment's Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses; the rights of the Doe parents under the Free Exercise Clause; the rights of both the Doe children and their parents under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses; and the Doe parents' federal constitutional rights of parenthood, as well as the Doe children's concomitant rights.<sup>[10]</sup> The United States, New Hampshire, and Cyrus then renewed their motions to dismiss.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>On September 30, 2009, the district court dismissed all of FFRF's federal claims on their merits,<sup>[12]</sup> and issued a final judgment in favor of the United States, the School Districts, and Cyrus.</p>\n<p>FFRF filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court's dismissal of its federal claims against the School Districts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The issue on appeal is whether the New Hampshire Act requiring that its public schools provide a period for the voluntary recitation of the Pledge violates the Establishment Clause, Free Exercise Clause, Equal Protection Clause, or Due Process Clause. We review de novo the district court's dismissal of FFRF's amended complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), accepting as true all well-pleaded facts in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs' favor. <i>Sutliffe v.

In our view, mere repetition of the phrase in secular ceremonies does not by itself deplete the phrase of all religious content.<sup>[15]</sup> A belief in God is a religious belief. That the phrase has some religious content is demonstrated by the fact that those who are religious, as well as those who are not, could reasonably be offended by the claim that it does not. <i>See </i><i>Myers v. Loudoun County Pub.

Telling either nonbelievers or believers that the words `under God' have no meaning contradicts what they know to be true.\").</p>\n<p>That the phrase \"under God\" has some religious content, however, is not determinative of the New Hampshire Act's constitutionality.

That fact does not itself dispose of the constitutional question either.

As FFRF does not allege entanglement, the third prong is not at issue here.</p>\n<p>FFRF concedes that the New Hampshire Act has a secular purposethe promotion of patriotismbut insists that this does not end the inquiry. FFRF argues that Congress had an impermissible religious purpose when it added the words \"under God\" to the text of the Pledge in 1954, and that this fact must be considered in our analysis. Even if so, the argument does not go to the first factor. We look at the purpose of New Hampshire when it enacted the statute in 2002, in the aftermath of the tragedy of September 11, 2001. Because FFRF has stipulated that New Hampshire had a secular purpose,<sup>[17]</sup> its claim of impermissible governmental purpose clearly fails on the first prong of <i>Lemon.</i></p>\n<p>FFRF argues, under the second factor, that the principal or primary effect of the New Hampshire Act is the advancement of religion. The Pledge's affirmation that ours is a \"nation, under God\" is not a mere reference to the fact that many Americans believe in a deity, nor to the undeniable historical significance of religion in the founding of our nation.

The result, FFRF argues, is that the recitation of the Pledge makes the Doe children outsiders to their peer group on the grounds of their religion.</p>\n<p>FFRF's premise is that children who choose not to recite the Pledge become outsiders based on their beliefs about religion. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> That premise is flawed. Under the New Hampshire Act, both the choice to engage in the recitation of the Pledge and the choice not to do so are entirely voluntary. The reasons pupils choose not to participate are not themselves obvious. There are a wide variety of reasons why students may choose not to recite the Pledge, including many reasons that do not rest on either religious or anti-religious belief. These include political disagreement with reciting the Pledge, a desire to be different, a view of our country's history or the significance of the flag that differs from that contained in the Pledge, and no reason at all. Even students who agree with the Pledge may choose not to <i>recite</i> the Pledge. Thus, the Doe children are not <i>religiously</i> differentiated from their peers merely by virtue of their non-participation in the Pledge.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the constitutionality of a state statute does not turn on the <i>subjective</i> feelings of plaintiffs as to whether a religious endorsement has occurred. Rather, in the endorsement analysis, the court assumes the viewpoint of an \"objective observer acquainted with the text, legislative history, and implementation of the statute.\" <i>Santa Fe,</i> 530 U.S. at 308, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118377\"><a href=\"/opinion/118377/santa-fe-independent-school-dist-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, <i>Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts</i> 175 (5th ed.1984)).</p>\n<p>Adopting the view of the objective observer fully aware of the relevant circumstances, we conclude there has been no endorsement of religion. The state legislature passed the New Hampshire Act in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 with the intent of fostering patriotism, <i>see, e.g.,</i> N.H.S. Jour. 945-67 (2002), and that is the statute's effect. Taken in the context of the words of the whole Pledge, the phrase \"under God\" does not convey a message of endorsement.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> The importance of context in the endorsement inquiry is made clear by two cases in which the Supreme Court has addressed the display of crèches at Christmas. In the first case, <i>Lynch,</i> the Court concluded that although a crèche displayed by the city was itself religious, the fact that it was located in a broader holiday display clarified to the reasonable observer that the city was, as part of the holiday, simply acknowledging religion with the crèche and not endorsing it. <i>Lynch,</i> 465 U.S. at 679-80, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111113\"><a href=\"/opinion/111113/lynch-v-donnelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1355</span></a></span>. By contrast, the Court in <i>County of Allegheny</i> concluded that a display of a crèche in a county courthouse with an angel bearing a banner proclaiming \"Gloria in Excelsis Deo,\" with no surrounding secular objects to change the message conveyed, was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. <i>County of Allegheny,</i> 492 U.S. at 598, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112331\"><a href=\"/opinion/112331/allegheny-county-v-greater-pittsburgh-aclu/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3086</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Along this spectrum, the two word phrase \"under God\" in the thirty-one words of the Pledge is much closer to the crèche at issue in <i>Lynch.</i> The phrase is surrounded by words that modify its significancenot by changing its meaning, but rather by providing clarity to the message conveyed and its purpose. <i>Cf. </i><i>Lynch,</i> 465 U.S. at 692, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111113\"><a href=\"/opinion/111113/lynch-v-donnelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Here, the words \"under God\" appear in a pledge to a flagitself a secular exercise, accompanied by no other religious language or symbolism.</p>\n<p>We reject FFRF's claim of unconstitutional endorsement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>The Coercion Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Relying heavily on <i>Lee,</i> FFRF finally argues that the recitation of the Pledge in public school classrooms unconstitutionally <i>coerces</i> the Doe children to \"recite a purely religious ideology.\"</p>\n<p><i>Lee</i> invalidated a public school's practice of inviting members of the clergy to give a nonsectarian prayer at its graduation ceremonies. <i>Lee,</i> 505 U.S. at 581-82, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112779\"><a href=\"/opinion/112779/lee-v-weisman/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2649</span></a></span>. Although attendance at the ceremonies and participation during the prayer were voluntary, the Court found that there was indirect pressure on attending students to stand or maintain respectful silence during the prayer, and that because silence during prayer signifies participation, this practice was unconstitutional. <i>Id.</i> at 598, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112779\"><a href=\"/opinion/112779/lee-v-weisman/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2649</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Coercion need not be direct to violate the Establishment Clause, but rather can take the form of \"subtle coercive pressure\" that interferes with an individual's \"real choice\" about whether to participate in the activity at issue. <i>Lee,</i> 505 U.S. at 592, 595, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112779\"><a href=\"/opinion/112779/lee-v-weisman/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2649</span></a></span>. In public schools, this danger of impermissible, indirect coercion is most pronounced because of the \"young impressionable children whose school attendance is statutorily compelled.\" <i>Schempp,</i> 374 U.S. at 307, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106658\"><a href=\"/opinion/106658/abington-school-dist-v-schempp/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1560</span></a></span> (Goldberg, J., concurring). As <i>Lee</i> stated, \"prayer exercises in public schools carry a particular risk of indirect coercion. The concern may not be limited to the context of schools, but it is most pronounced there.\" <i>Lee,</i> 505 U.S. at 592, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112779\"><a href=\"/opinion/112779/lee-v-weisman/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2649</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>FFRF contends that the Pledge, while not a prayer, is more problematic than the prayer at issue in <i>Lee.</i> It argues that the students in this case are younger and more impressionable; that they are led by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> teachers whom they respect as authorities, rather than by a member of the clergy whom they do not know; that those who participate are encouraged to verbalize the words, rather than merely listen; that the Pledge occurs every day, rather than once or twice in their school career; that a refusal to participate in the recitation of the Pledge is more obvious than refusing to listen to a prayer; and that unlike at a graduation ceremony, the students do not have their parents next to them to support them in their non-participation. These concerns do not make the New Hampshire Act unconstitutional. At least two factors distinguish <i>Lee</i> from this case.</p>\n<p>First, like other courts that have reviewed the Pledge, we think it relevant that the religious content of the phrase \"under God\" is couched in a non-religious text.<sup>[20]</sup> This fact is not dispositive, but it is significant. It removes the case from the direct scope of <i>Lee,</i> where the Court explained: \"These dominant facts mark and <i>control the confines</i> of our decision: State officials direct the performance of a <i>formal religious exercise....\" </i><i>Lee,</i> 505 U.S. at 586, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112779\"><a href=\"/opinion/112779/lee-v-weisman/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2649</span></a></span> (emphasis added). Recitation of the Pledge is not a formal religious exercise.</p>\n<p>Second, the logic of <i>Lee</i> does not apply directly to the case before us. The <i>Lee</i> finding of unconstitutional coercion can be read to result from a three-step analysis involving two premises and a conclusion. The Court found that students were being coerced into silence during the saying of the prayer; that silence was, in the eyes of the community, functionally identical to participation in the prayer; and that therefore, students were being functionally coerced into participation in the prayer in violation of the Constitution.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p>A key premise is different here. While in <i>Lee,</i> \"the act of standing or remaining silent was an expression of participation in the rabbi's prayer,\" <i>Lee,</i> 505 U.S. at 593, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112779\"><a href=\"/opinion/112779/lee-v-weisman/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2649</span></a></span>, silence by students is not an expression of participation in the Pledge. Rather, a student who remains <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> silent during the saying of the Pledge engages in overt non-participation by doing so, and this non-participation is not itself an expression of either religious or non-religious belief.</p>\n<p>FFRF's claim of unconstitutional coercion under <i>Lee</i> fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Pledge Does Not Violate the Free Exercise Clause</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under the Free Exercise Clause, the government may not \"(1) compel affirmation of religious beliefs; (2) punish the expression of religious doctrines it believes to be false; (3) impose special disabilities on the basis of religious views or religious status; or (4) lend its power to one side or the other in controversies over religious authorities or dogma.\" <i>Parker v. Hurley,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></span>, 103 (1st Cir.2008). The First Amendment's prohibition on laws \"prohibiting the free exercise\" of religion is incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Cantwell v.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1213</span></span> (1940).</p>\n<p>FFRF contends that the recitation of the Pledge in the Doe children's classrooms violates their ability to freely believe in atheism or agnosticism, and places an unconstitutional burden on the Doe parents' free exercise right to instill their religious values in their children. This claim is foreclosed by <i>Parker.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Parker,</i> we explained that \"[p]ublic schools are not obliged to shield individual students from ideas which potentially are religiously offensive, particularly when the school imposes no requirement that the student agree with or affirm those ideas, or even participate in discussions about them.\" <i>Parker,</i> 514 F.3d at 106. Because the Doe children allege mere exposure to the religious content of the Pledge, they cannot state a claim under the Free Exercise Clause, nor can their parents, as \"the mere fact that a child is exposed on occasion in public school to a concept offensive to a parent's religious belief does not inhibit the parent from instructing the child differently.\" <i>Id.</i> at 105.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Pledge Does Not Violate the Equal Protection Clause</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Constitution \"guarantees that those who are similarly situated will be treated alike.\" <i>In re Subpoena to Witzel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203374\"><a href=\"/opinion/203374/in-re-subpoena-to-witzel/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, 118 (1st Cir.2008). Invoking the Equal Protection Clause, FFRF contends that the School Districts have a duty to show equal respect for the Does' atheist and agnostic beliefs, that they are in breach of this duty by leading students in affirming that God exists, and that they created a social environment that perpetuates prejudice against atheists and agnostics. However, the New Hampshire Act does \"not require different treatment of any class of people because of their religious beliefs,\" nor does it \"give preferential treatment to any particular religion.\" <i>Wirzburger v. Galvin,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></span>, 283 (1st Cir.2005). Rather, as the district court found, \"it applies equally to those who believe in God, those who do not, and those who do not have a belief either way, giving adherents of all persuasions the right to participate or not participate in reciting the pledge, for any or no reason.\" <i>Freedom From Religion Found. v.

Therefore, FFRF's equal protection claim fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>The Pledge Does Not Violate the Due Process Clause</i>\n</h2>\n<p>FFRF's final allegation is that the recitation of the Pledge in the Doe children's classrooms violates the Doe parents' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> fundamental constitutional right of parenthood protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. FFRF argues that this right is embraced within the general right of parenthood recognized by <i>Troxel v.

In any event, the claim lacks merit, as \"the substantive due process clause ... does not give [parents] the degree of control over their children's education that their requested relief seeks.\" <i>Parker,</i> 514 F.3d at 102-03.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We hold that the New Hampshire School Patriot Act and the voluntary, teacher-led recitation of the Pledge by the state's public school students do not violate the Constitution.

Certain Athenian males, at puberty, took a longer pledge, the opening three sentences of which were: \"We will never bring disgrace to this, our city, by any act of dishonesty or cowardice, nor ever desert our suffering comrades in ranks. We will fight for the ideals and sacred things of the city, both alone and with many; we will revere and obey the city's law and do our best to incite a like respect and reverence in those above us who are prone to annul and set them at naught. We will strive unceasingly to quicken the public's sense of civic duty, that thus, in all these ways, we will transmit this city not only not less, but greater, better, and more beautiful than it was transmitted to us.\" <i>Pledge of Allegiance,</i> Lapham's Quarterly, Fall 2010, at 98.</p>\n<p>[5]  FFRF's claim against School Administrative Unit 70, which controls the high schools that the Doe children will eventually attend, was dropped in the amended complaint.</p>\n<p>[6]  Specifically, FFRF sought a declaration that Congress violated the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses in passing the Act of 1954, which added the words \"under God\" to the Pledge; that the words \"under God\" in the Pledge violated the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment, and The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA); and that the School Districts, in having their agents lead the recitation of the Pledge, violated the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the RFRA, Article 6 of the New Hampshire Constitution, and other provisions of New Hampshire state law.</p>\n<p>[7]  FFRF asked the court to \"demand\" that Congress act to remove the words \"under God\" from 4 U.S.C. § 4; that the United States use its power to remove the words \"under God\" from 4 U.S.C. § 4; and that the School Districts cease and desist using the Pledge.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although the United States was already a defendant with respect to FFRF's claim that 4 U.S.C. § 4 is unconstitutional on its face, it was not a defendant with respect to FFRF's claims challenging the recitation of the Pledge in New Hampshire schools, and it therefore moved to intervene as a defendant against what it took to be an as-applied challenge to 4 U.S.C. § 4. While the district court allowed the United State to intervene, it ultimately rejected the argument that the federal statute was being \"applied,\" as the statute merely prescribes the text of the Pledge and does not command any person to recite it or lead others in its recitation.</p>\n<p>[9]  The Federal Defendants' motion also requested dismissal of the claims against the School Districts on the grounds that FFRF failed to state a claim, but this part of the motion was denied, as the School Districts had not filed a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>[10]  FFRF also advanced a variety of state law claims that are not before us on appeal.</p>\n<p>[11]  The district court construed these motions to dismiss as having been advanced by the School Districts as well.</p>\n<p>[12]  Having done so, the court found that principles of comity counseled in favor of not exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims and dismissed the state claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p>[13]  Every federal circuit court that has addressed a state pledge statute has rejected the claim of unconstitutionality. <i>See </i><i>Croft v.

They may even feel induced to recite the Pledge themselves.... But the main distinction is this: Here, the students are being coerced to participate in a patriotic exercise, not a religious exercise.\"); <i>Myers,</i> 418 F.3d at 408 (\"The indirect coercion analysis discussed in <i>Lee, Schempp,</i> and <i>Engel,</i> simply is not relevant in cases, like this one, challenging non-religious activities. Even assuming that the recitation of the Pledge contains a risk of indirect coercion, the indirect coercion is not threatening to establish religion, but patriotism.\").</p>\n<p>[21]  <i>See </i><i>Lee v.

There can be no doubt that for many, if not most, of the students at the graduation, the act of standing or remaining silent was an expression of participation in the rabbi's prayer. That was the very point of the religious exercise. It is of little comfort to a dissenter, then, to be told that for her the act of standing or remaining in silence signifies mere respect, rather than participation. What matters is that, given our social conventions, a reasonable dissenter in this milieu could believe that the group exercise signified her own participation or approval of it. Finding no violation under these circumstances would place objectors in the dilemma of participating, with all that implies, or protesting.\").</p>\n\n</div>",
