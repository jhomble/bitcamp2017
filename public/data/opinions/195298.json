Stillman for appellant.\n               \nMichael M.  DuBose, Assistant  United States  Attorney, with  whom\n                 \nJay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n           \n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n          Per Curiam.    A  jury  convicted  the  appellant,\n                    \n\nFrancisco  Javier  Pineda-Paz,  of  possessing  cocaine base\n\n(\"crack\")  with  intent  to  distribute it.    The  evidence\n\nagainst him was strong.   A coconspirator, Gonzalo Ceballos-\n\nMejia  (after  pleading  guilty)  testified that,  in  early\n\nFebruary 1993:\n\n          1)   A drug dealer called Manuel met with  Pineda,\n               Ceballos, and  Eduardo Gomez (who  turned out\n               to be a government informant) in Manuel's New\n               Jersey  apartment.    With   Pineda  present,\n               Manuel gave  Ceballos a package of (about 100\n               grams of) crack, told  him it was worth about\n               $21,000, and said he  would pay him $5,000 to\n               take it to Maine.\n\n          2)   On February 12,  Pineda, Ceballos, and  Gomez\n               took the bus to Maine.   Since the package of\n               drugs was too big to fit into Ceballos's coat\n               pocket,  Pineda ended up carrying the package\n               of  drugs in  his coat  pocket for  the first\n               part of the trip.  Pineda later gave Ceballos\n               his (Pineda's)  coat with the drugs,  so that\n               Ceballos would have  the drugs with  him when\n               they got off the bus in Maine.\n\n          3)   Upon   their   arrival   in  Maine,   Pineda,\n               Ceballos,  and  Gomez  met another  disguised\n               government  agent, DEA  Agent Brady,  who was\n               pretending  to be  a  drug buyer.   All  four\n               drove  off in  a  car.   Agent Brady,  asking\n               questions   through   Gomez   who  acted   as\n               interpreter,  established  that Ceballos  had\n               the drugs  and  that the  price was  $21,000.\n               Agent Brady  then examined  the cocaine.   He\n               left  the  car,  ostensibly  to  obtain  more\n               money,  at  which   time  government   agents\n               arrested Pineda and Ceballos.\n\nAgent  Brady  corroborated many  of  these  facts.   Indeed,\n\nPineda  admitted  most of  them,  including  that he  helped\n\nCeballos carry a  \"package\" to Maine.   Pineda, however, did\n\nnot admit that he  was present when Manuel planned  the drug\n\ntransaction.  And, he testified that the package was covered\n\nwith aluminum foil  and that  he did not  know, nor care  to\n\nask, about its contents.   Rather, he said, he was simply  a\n\nfriend of Ceballos  who had  gone along with  him to  Maine,\n\nhelping to carry the package, essentially for the ride.  The\n\njury did not believe Pineda's story,  perhaps because of the\n\nunusual coat-switch; or because  Pineda apparently showed no\n\nsurprise, nor protested, during the drug sale in the car; or\n\nbecause Pineda admitted to law enforcement  officials (after\n\nreceiving Miranda  warnings) that he  had come to  Maine \"to\n                 \n\nhelp  sell the drugs\" (though he later said he admitted this\n\nonly because  the officer  \"frightened\" him  and hurt him  a\n\n\"bit\" when he  \"touch[ed]\"/\"hit\" him  on the leg).   In  any\n\nevent, the jury convicted Pineda; and the court then imposed\n\na sentence of 121 months.\n\n          Pineda's  arguments on appeal  rather clearly lack\n\nmerit  and do  not warrant  lengthy discussion.   First,  he\n\npoints   out  that   Gomez,  the  government   informer  who\n\naccompanied him  and Ceballos,  lied before the  grand jury.\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nIndeed, the government concedes  that Gomez falsely told the\n\ngrand jury that  Pineda had  told him that  he (Pineda)  had\n\npreviously been  in the drug  business and brought  drugs to\n\nMaine.  Pineda, however, does not argue that the  government\n\nknew Gomez would testify falsely or that it acted improperly\n\nin any other way.   And, the district  court found that  any\n\nerror caused by  the admission of  this false testimony  was\n\nharmless, see Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n250, 256 (1988)  (\"customary harmless-error inquiry\" applies\n\nto grand jury stage  errors), for the grand jury  had before\n\nit   other  evidence   more  than   sufficient  to   warrant\n          \n\nindictment.  See United States v.  Maceo, 873 F.2d 1, 3 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.) (district  court finding of harmless  error in respect\n\nto errors at the grand jury stage reviewed only for an abuse\n\nof  discretion), cert.  denied,  493 U.S.  840  (1989).   We\n                              \n\nshould  also  note  the  obvious, that  since  the  perjured\n\ntestimony was not introduced at trial, it did not affect the\n\noutcome of the trial.\n\n          Second, Pineda complains  that the district  court\n\nimproperly  admitted  hearsay  evidence,   namely,  Pineda's\n\naffirmative nod  (and related translations)  in response  to\n\nAgent  Brady's question, translated by Gomez, whether Pineda\n\nhad ever been to Maine before with Ceballos.  Defendant says\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nthis evidence left the jury with  the \"false impression that\n\nhe  had been to Maine  [before] to do  drug deals\" (emphasis\n                                                 \n\nadded).   The defendant did  not object to  the admission of\n\nthe evidence at the  time, however.  And, it  is, therefore,\n\nadmissible  whether or  not it  somehow rests  upon hearsay.\n\nSee  United States v. Tabares,  951 F.2d 405,  409 (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1991)   (\"[H]earsay,  if   no   objection  is   raised,   is\n\nadmissible.\")  (citation omitted); United  States v. Newton,\n                                                           \n\n891 F.2d 944, 947-48  (1st Cir. 1989).  Nor  was defendant's\n\nfailure  to  object  surprising,  since  the  testimony  was\n\nelicited by  the defense,  not the prosecution,  and it  was\n                        \n\nelicited purposefully,  for its supposed  impeachment value.\n                     \n\nWe add that,  in any event,  given the strength of  the case\n\nagainst Pineda, any error on this matter would be harmless.\n\n          Third,  defendant argues  that the  district court\n\nshould have  granted his post-verdict motion,  under Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 33, for a new trial.   He based that motion on  the\n\nlate  discovery  of  two  documents: (1)  a  Honduran  birth\n\ncertificate  in the name of Sergio Pineda, age 15, and (2) a\n\nrecently-issued Honduran  ID card  in the name  of Francisco\n\nJavier Pineda, age  19, containing a photograph  of a person\n\nother  than   the  defendant.    These   two  documents,  in\n\ndefendant's view,  showed that  he was not  Francisco Javier\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nPineda, but Francisco  Javier's 15-year-old younger  brother\n\nSergio, and thus he should have been tried as a juvenile.\n\n          The  district court  concluded, however,  that the\n\ndocuments  did not  show that the  defendant was  Sergio and\n\nthat  \"the defendant  in  front of  me  is Francisco  Javier\n\nPineda-Paz.\"   The only thing connecting  the \"Sergio\" birth\n\ncertificate to  the defendant, or  connecting the \"Francisco\n\nJavier\"  ID to someone  other than the  defendant, the court\n\nexplained,  was the  defendant's testimony  to  that effect.\n\n(On the photo ID connection, the Government had explained to\n\nthe court that  it would  have been easy  for some  Honduran\n\nfriend of the  defendant to take the  defendant's real birth\n\ncertificate and use it  to get a \"Francisco Javier\"  ID with\n\nthe friend's photograph on it.)   And, on issues relating to\n\n\"identification\" and \"age,\"  the court found,  the defendant\n\n\"no longer has any  credibility at all.\"  The  court pointed\n\nout:\n\n          [T]he defendant first identified himself\n          as Francisco Javier Pineda-Paz,  age 19.\n          Sometime thereafter,  in connection with\n          his custody,  he announced that  was age\n          15, . .  . [a claim for which]  a forged\n          birth certificate was provided.\n\n               Thereafter he  withdrew that claim,\n          and by the time  of trial, testified . .\n          .  under  oath  that  he  was  Francisco\n          Javier  Pineda-Paz, and that  he was age\n          19, and testified that he had  lied when\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\n          he had earlier said that he was 15.  And\n          now  when  sentencing  is imminent,  the\n          defendant again come forward challenging\n          his age  and  this for  the first  time,\n          challenges his identity and claims to be\n          Sergio .  . . , who  previously had been\n          identified as one of his brothers.\n\n          On the  basis of  all this evidence,  the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that defendant's new documentary evidence\n\n(and  the  testimony  underlying  it) was  not  credible  is\n\nadequately supportable.  See Veillette v. United States, 778\n                                                       \n\nF.2d  899, 902  (1st Cir.  1985) (trial judge's  findings of\n\nfact are set aside only if clearly erroneous), cert. denied,\n                                                           \n\n476  U.S. 1115 (1986).  The district court's decision not to\n\ngrant a new trial is therefore lawful.  See United States v.\n                                                         \n\nWright, 625 F.2d  1017, 1019  (1st Cir. 1980)  (a new  trial\n      \n\nmotion  is granted  only  if, among  other  things, the  new\n\nevidence \"will probably\" lead to a different outcome).\n\n          Fourth,  Pineda argues  that  the  district  court\n\nshould  not  have  increased  his sentence  (to  121  months\n\ninstead of the 120 months the statute mandatorily imposes, a\n\none  month  difference)  for  an \"obstruction  of  justice.\"\n\nPineda's presentation  of a forged birth  certificate to the\n\nmagistrate  prior to  trial  (purportedly showing  he was  a\n\nminor)  and his attempt, based  on the forgery,  to have the\n\nindictment  dismissed, however,  provide a  sufficient legal\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nbasis for the  increase.   See U.S.S.G    3C1.1  application\n                              \n\nnote  3(c)  (\"[T]his  enhancement applies  [to]  producing a\n\nfalse document during an  official investigation or judicial\n\nproceeding.\")  (ellipses omitted); id. application note 3(f)\n                                     \n\n(same for \"providing materially false information to a judge\n\nor magistrate\");  see also United  States v. Biyaga,  9 F.3d\n                                                   \n\n204 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          Appellant's  remaining  claims are  without merit.\n\nFor the reasons stated,  the judgment of the district  court\n\nis\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n",

The evidence against him was strong.  A coconspirator, Gonzalo Ceballos-Mejia (after pleading guilty) testified that, in early February 1993:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1) A drug dealer called Manuel met with Pineda, Ceballos, and Eduardo Gomez (who turned out to be a government informant) in Manuel's New Jersey apartment.

Since the package of drugs was too big to fit into Ceballos's coat pocket, Pineda ended up carrying the package of drugs in his coat pocket for the first part of the trip.  Pineda later gave Ceballos his (Pineda's) coat with the drugs, so that Ceballos would have the drugs with him when they got off the bus in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3) Upon their arrival in Maine, Pineda, Ceballos, and Gomez met another disguised government agent, DEA Agent Brady, who was pretending to be a drug buyer.  All four drove off in a car.  Agent Brady, asking questions through Gomez who acted as interpreter, established that Ceballos had the drugs and that the price was $21,000.  Agent Brady then examined the cocaine.  He left the car, ostensibly to obtain more money, at which time government agents arrested Pineda and Ceballos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Brady corroborated many of these facts.  Indeed, Pineda admitted most of them, including that he helped Ceballos carry a \"package\" to Maine.  Pineda, however, did not admit that he was present when Manuel planned the drug transaction.  And, he testified that the package was covered with aluminum foil and that he did not know, nor care to ask, about its contents.  Rather, he said, he was simply a friend of Ceballos who had gone along with him to Maine, helping to carry the package, essentially for the ride.  The jury did not believe Pineda's story, perhaps because of the unusual coat-switch;  or because Pineda apparently showed no surprise, nor protested, during the drug sale in the car;  or because Pineda admitted to law enforcement officials (after receiving Miranda warnings) that he had come to Maine \"to help sell the drugs\" (though he later said he admitted this only because the officer \"frightened\" him and hurt him a \"bit\" when he \"touch[ed]\"/\"hit\" him on the leg).  In any event, the jury convicted Pineda;  and the court then imposed a sentence of 121 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pineda's arguments on appeal rather clearly lack merit and do not warrant lengthy discussion.  First, he points out that Gomez, the government informer who accompanied him and Ceballos, lied before the grand jury.  Indeed, the government concedes that Gomez falsely told the grand jury that Pineda had told him that he (Pineda) had previously been in the drug business and brought drugs to Maine.  Pineda, however, does not argue that the government knew Gomez would testify falsely or that it acted improperly in any other way.  And, the district court found that any error caused by the admission of this false testimony was harmless,  see Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250, 256 (1988) (\"customary harmless-error inquiry\" applies to grand jury stage errors), for the grand jury had before it other evidence more than sufficient to warrant indictment.  See United States v.  Maceo, 873 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.)  (district court finding of harmless error in respect to errors at the grand jury stage reviewed only for an abuse of discretion), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 840 (1989).  We should also note the obvious, that since the perjured testimony was not introduced at trial, it did not affect the outcome of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Pineda complains that the district court improperly admitted hearsay evidence, namely, Pineda's affirmative nod (and related translations) in response to Agent Brady's question, translated by Gomez, whether Pineda had ever been to Maine before with Ceballos.  Defendant says this evidence left the jury with the \"false impression that he had been to Maine [before] to do drug deals \" (emphasis added).  The defendant did not object to the admission of the evidence at the time, however.  And, it is, therefore, admissible whether or not it somehow rests upon hearsay.  See  United States v.

Nor was defendant's failure to object surprising, since the testimony was elicited by the defense, not the prosecution, and it was elicited purposefully, for its supposed impeachment value.

He based that motion on the late discovery of two documents:  (1) a Honduran birth certificate in the name of Sergio Pineda, age 15, and (2) a recently-issued Honduran ID card in the name of Francisco Javier Pineda, age 19, containing a photograph of a person other than the defendant.  These two documents, in defendant's view, showed that he was not Francisco Javier Pineda, but Francisco Javier's 15-year-old younger brother Sergio, and thus he should have been tried as a juvenile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded, however, that the documents did not show that the defendant was Sergio and that \"the defendant in front of me is Francisco Javier Pineda-Paz.\"  The only thing connecting the \"Sergio\" birth certificate to the defendant, or connecting the \"Francisco Javier\" ID to someone other than the defendant, the court explained, was the defendant's testimony to that effect.  (On the photo ID connection, the Government had explained to the court that it would have been easy for some Honduran friend of the defendant to take the defendant's real birth certificate and use it to get a \"Francisco Javier\" ID with the friend's photograph on it.)  And, on issues relating to \"identification\" and \"age,\" the court found, the defendant \"no longer has any credibility at all.\"  The court pointed out:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>[T]he defendant first identified himself as Francisco Javier Pineda-Paz, age 19.

See Veillette v. United States, 778 F.2d 899, 902 (1st Cir. 1985) (trial judge's findings of fact are set aside only if clearly erroneous), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1115 (1986).  The district court's decision not to grant a new trial is therefore lawful.   See United States v. Wright, 625 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir. 1980) (a new trial motion is granted only if, among other things, the new evidence \"will probably\" lead to a different outcome).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, Pineda argues that the district court should not have increased his sentence (to 121 months instead of the 120 months the statute mandatorily imposes, a one month difference) for an \"obstruction of justice.\"  Pineda's presentation of a forged birth certificate to the magistrate prior to trial (purportedly showing he was a minor) and his attempt, based on the forgery, to have the indictment dismissed, however, provide a sufficient legal basis for the increase.

The evidence against him was strong.  A coconspirator, Gonzalo Ceballos-Mejia (after pleading guilty) testified that, in early February 1993:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1) A drug dealer called Manuel met with Pineda, Ceballos, and Eduardo Gomez (who turned out to be a government informant) in Manuel's New Jersey apartment.  With Pineda present, Manuel gave Ceballos a package of (about 100 grams of) crack, told him it was worth about $21,000, and said he would pay him $5,000 to take it to Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2) On February 12, Pineda, Ceballos, and Gomez took the bus to Maine.  Since the package of drugs was too big to fit into Ceballos's coat pocket, Pineda ended up carrying the package of drugs in his coat pocket for the first part of the trip.  Pineda later gave Ceballos his (Pineda's) coat with the drugs, so that Ceballos would have the drugs with him when they got off the bus in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3) Upon their arrival in Maine, Pineda, Ceballos, and Gomez met another disguised government agent, DEA Agent Brady, who was pretending to be a drug buyer.  All four drove off in a car.  Agent Brady, asking questions through Gomez who acted as interpreter, established that Ceballos had the drugs and that the price was $21,000.  Agent Brady then examined the cocaine.  He left the car, ostensibly to obtain more money, at which time government agents arrested Pineda and Ceballos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Brady corroborated many of these facts.  Indeed, Pineda admitted most of them, including that he helped Ceballos carry a \"package\" to Maine.  Pineda, however, did not admit that he was present when Manuel planned the drug transaction.  And, he testified that the package was covered with aluminum foil and that he did not know, nor care to ask, about its contents.  Rather, he said, he was simply a friend of Ceballos who had gone along with him to Maine, helping to carry the package, essentially for the ride.  The jury did not believe Pineda's story, perhaps because of the unusual coat-switch;  or because Pineda apparently showed no surprise, nor protested, during the drug sale in the car;  or because Pineda admitted to law enforcement officials (after receiving Miranda warnings) that he had come to Maine \"to help sell the drugs\" (though he later said he admitted this only because the officer \"frightened\" him and hurt him a \"bit\" when he \"touch[ed]\"/\"hit\" him on the leg).  In any event, the jury convicted Pineda;  and the court then imposed a sentence of 121 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pineda's arguments on appeal rather clearly lack merit and do not warrant lengthy discussion.  First, he points out that Gomez, the government informer who accompanied him and Ceballos, lied before the grand jury.  Indeed, the government concedes that Gomez falsely told the grand jury that Pineda had told him that he (Pineda) had previously been in the drug business and brought drugs to Maine.  Pineda, however, does not argue that the government knew Gomez would testify falsely or that it acted improperly in any other way.  And, the district court found that any error caused by the admission of this false testimony was harmless,  see Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112125\"><a href=\"/opinion/112125/bank-of-nova-scotia-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span>, 256 (1988) (\"customary harmless-error inquiry\" applies to grand jury stage errors), for the grand jury had before it other evidence more than sufficient to warrant indictment.  See United States v.  Maceo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521950\"><a href=\"/opinion/521950/united-states-v-roberto-maceo/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.)  (district court finding of harmless error in respect to errors at the grand jury stage reviewed only for an abuse of discretion), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></span> (1989).  We should also note the obvious, that since the perjured testimony was not introduced at trial, it did not affect the outcome of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Pineda complains that the district court improperly admitted hearsay evidence, namely, Pineda's affirmative nod (and related translations) in response to Agent Brady's question, translated by Gomez, whether Pineda had ever been to Maine before with Ceballos.  Defendant says this evidence left the jury with the \"false impression that he had been to Maine [before] to do drug deals \" (emphasis added).  The defendant did not object to the admission of the evidence at the time, however.  And, it is, therefore, admissible whether or not it somehow rests upon hearsay.  See  United States v. Tabares, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573870\"><a href=\"/opinion/573870/united-states-v-martha-tabares-united-states-v-ramiro-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span>, 409 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"[H]earsay, if no objection is raised, is admissible.\")  (citation omitted);   United States v. Newton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533777\"><a href=\"/opinion/533777/united-states-v-stuart-h-newton-united-states-of-america-v-thomas-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span>, 947-48 (1st Cir. 1989).  Nor was defendant's failure to object surprising, since the testimony was elicited by the defense, not the prosecution, and it was elicited purposefully, for its supposed impeachment value.  We add that, in any event, given the strength of the case against Pineda, any error on this matter would be harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, defendant argues that the district court should have granted his post-verdict motion, under Fed.
