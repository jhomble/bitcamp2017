Defendant-Appellant Robert\n\nCarey     (\"Carey\")    appeals       from    his     conviction       and   subsequent\n\nsentencing in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts.         Count    One     charged      Carey   along      with   Chamond\n\nHenderson     (\"Henderson\")       and       Kimberly     Powers   (\"Powers\")       with\n\nconspiring to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams\n\nof   crack   cocaine    in     violation      of    21   U.S.C.   §    846.1    Carey,\n\nHenderson,    and     Powers    were    also       charged   in   Count     Five   with\n\npossessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute it and with\n\ndistribution in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. §\n\n2.\n\n             Carey and Henderson were tried jointly.                        Both were\n\nconvicted and appealed separately.                  Henderson's appeal is also\n\nbefore us, and is the subject of a separate opinion.                        See United\n\nStates v. Henderson, No. 01-2392.                   Powers entered into a plea\n\nbargain with the government and testified at the trial.\n\n                                I.     THE EVIDENCE\n\n             In October 1998, the Drug Enforcement Administration\n\n(\"DEA\") began an investigation into crack cocaine trafficking in\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts.             Special Agents Timothy Anderson and\n\nRobert Guerard of the DEA used Joseph Mozynski (\"Mozynski\"), a\n\n      1\n       Grams and ounces are used interchangeably throughout this\nopinion. It should be noted that one ounce equals 28.35 grams.\nSee United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, §\n2D1.1, comments. (n.11) (Nov. 2002).\n\n                                         -2-\n\fknown crack cocaine user, to serve as a cooperating witness.\n\nMozynski made four purchases of significant quantities of crack\n\ncocaine during the investigation.            The DEA wired Mozynski with a\n\nconcealed monitoring device that enabled agents to tape record the\n\ndrug transactions.        The first of these drug transactions occurred\n\nat Carey's house on 6 Denny Street.            The subsequent transactions\n\noriginated at Carey's house but were completed at various locations\n\nwithin a two-block radius.\n\n            During      the   first   transaction,   on     October    19,   1998,\n\nMozynski purchased 23.7 grams of crack cocaine from co-defendant\n\nHenderson at Carey's house.             Prior to October 19, Carey told\n\nMozynski that all he needed was \"24 hours notice to get the deal\n\ndone.\"     Mozynski and Carey agreed that Mozynski would pay $1,200\n\nfor   25   grams   of    crack   cocaine,    with   Carey    getting    $200   for\n\nfacilitating the deal, and that Mozynski would pick up the crack\n\ncocaine at Carey's residence.            On October 19, Mozynski entered\n\nCarey's house and met with Carey, co-defendant Powers, and a woman\n\nnamed Lynn Cappulett.         Carey paged Henderson after Mozynski showed\n\nPowers the $1,200.            When Henderson called, Carey answered and\n\nhanded the phone to Powers.           Powers told Henderson that Mozynski\n\nwas there with the money, and then informed Mozynski that Henderson\n\nwould arrive within five minutes.             Henderson called one minute\n\nlater, and Carey again answered the phone and gave it to Powers.\n\nCarey also told Mozynski that he wanted his $200 for setting up the\n\n                                       -3-\n\fdeal.     Shortly thereafter, Henderson arrived at Carey's residence.\n\nHenderson, Mozynski, and Powers went into a bedroom where Henderson\n\ngave Mozynski 23.7 grams of crack cocaine in exchange for $1,200.\n\nHenderson and Mozynski discussed doing larger deals in the future,\n\nand Henderson told Mozynski to contact him through Powers.               Carey\n\nlater became angry because he did not get the $200 he expected to\n\nreceive from the drug deal.          Carey told Powers that he was upset\n\nbecause he had been cut out of the deal and lost money as a result.\n\n             On October 27, 1998, Mozynski met Powers at Carey's\n\nresidence.     Carey told Powers \"I don't want nobody around here,\"\n\nand \"[i]ts got nothing to do with me and you know it.\"             Mozysnki\n\nand Powers left Carey's house and successfully conducted a drug\n\ntransaction with Henderson in the basement of Henderson's apartment\n\nbuilding.      On November 3, 1998, Mozysnki again met Powers at\n\nCarey's house,     but   left   to   conclude   a   drug   transaction    with\n\nHenderson in the basement of his apartment.2\n\n             On November 16, 1988, Mozynski met with Carey and Powers\n\nat Carey's house.     Thereafter, Powers and Mozynski left the house\n\nand   conducted    another   drug    transaction    with   Henderson     at   a\n\ndifferent location, except this time Henderson sold them wax. Once\n\nthe agents realized that Henderson had sold wax rather than crack\n\ncocaine, they directed Mozynski to contact Henderson.              Mozynski\n\n\n      2\n       For a more detailed account of the October 27, and November\n3, 1998, transactions, see Henderson, No. 01-2392.\n\n                                      -4-\n\funsuccessfully attempted to contact Henderson and Powers, and then\n\ncalled Carey.     Carey agreed to call Henderson to \"find out what\n\nhappened.\"     After waiting to get a response by phone, the agents\n\ninstructed Mozynski to go to Carey's residence in order to talk to\n\nCarey directly.\n\n             Mozynski went to Carey's residence three separate times\n\nto speak with Carey.         Thereafter, Carey tried to arrange the\n\ndelivery of crack cocaine from Henderson.          Carey called Henderson\n\non the phone so that Mozynski and Henderson could further discuss\n\nHenderson's delivery of the crack cocaine to Agent Guerard.           Carey\n\neven   provided   Mozynski    with   Henderson's    pager   number,   which\n\nMozynski subsequently gave to Agent Guerard.          Agent Guerard paged\n\nHenderson, who returned the page and promised to deliver one ounce\n\nof crack cocaine on the following day, and two-and-one-half ounces\n\non the day after that.       On November 17, 1998, Mozynski arranged\n\nwith Henderson, through Powers, to receive the one ounce of crack\n\ncocaine promised by Henderson to Agent Guerard.              Mozynski met\n\nPowers on Goulding Street in Worcester, two blocks away from\n\nHenderson's     apartment    building.     Henderson    gave   a   package\n\ncontaining 19.68 grams of crack cocaine to Powers and Powers then\n\ngave the crack cocaine to Mozynski.\n\n             Additional evidence relevant to Carey included testimony\n\nat trial by Powers that she saw Carey sell crack cocaine \"hundreds\n\nof times\" and that his supplier was Henderson.          Powers said that\n\n                                     -5-\n\fshe saw Carey purchase crack cocaine from Henderson at least one\n\nhundred times, and that Carey either used the crack cocaine himself\n\nor resold it to his own customers.           Powers further testified that\n\nboth she and Carey sold crack cocaine out of Carey's residence.\n\n           There was other evidence of Carey's drug sales. Mozynski\n\ntestified that he purchased crack cocaine from Carey on a separate\n\noccasion in early October 1998.            A recorded conversation between\n\nCarey and Mozynski at Carey's house included a statement by a third\n\nperson asking Carey for $20 worth of crack cocaine.              At the time of\n\nCarey's arrest, agents seized quantities of crack cocaine and more\n\nthan $1,000 cash from Carey's house.\n\n                              II.    THE ISSUES\n\nA.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           1.     Testimony of Powers and Mozynski\n\n           Carey     argues   that    the     government's       evidence   was\n\ninsufficient to support the jury verdict against him for conspiracy\n\nto   distribute    crack   cocaine   and    for   aiding   and   abetting   the\n\ndistribution of crack cocaine.        In considering Carey's sufficiency\n\nclaims, we must \"view the evidence, together with all reasonable\n\ninferences that may be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable\n\nto the government\" and consider whether a rational fact finder\n\ncould have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v.\n\nLoder, 23 F.3d 586, 589 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal quotations\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fomitted). We review \"the totality of the evidence, both direct and\n\ncircumstantial.\"    United States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d 1069, 1073\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).     All issues of credibility must be resolved in\n\nfavor of the verdict.    United States v. Nueva, 979 F.2d. 880, 883\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          To prove conspiracy in a criminal case, the government\n\nmust demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that an agreement\n\nexisted to commit the underlying substantive offense, that the\n\ndefendant knew of the agreement, and that he opted to join the\n\nconspiracy with the intention that the substantive offense be\n\ncommitted.     See United States v. Barnes, 244 F.3d 172, 175 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).      To convict Carey of the conspiracy charge, the\n\ngovernment had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Carey\n\nintended to agree and intended that crack cocaine be possessed and\n\ndistributed.     See United States v. Cruz, 981 F.2d 613, 616 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).     \"The agreement may be express or tacit and may be\n\nproved by direct or circumstantial evidence.\"     United States v.\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          Carey argues that there was no reliable evidence showing\n\nany agreement on his part to enter into a conspiracy to distribute\n\ncrack cocaine.     Specifically, he contends that the testimony of\n\nPowers and Mozynski was \"inherently unreliable,\" and failed to\n\nestablish his participation in the conspiracy.    We disagree.\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          This circuit has held that \"[u]ncorroborated testimony of\n\na cooperating accomplice may sustain a conviction so long as that\n\ntestimony is not facially incredible.\"             United States v. Torres-\n\nGalindo, 206 F.3d 136, 139-40 (1st Cir. 2000).               The testimony of\n\nPowers and Mozynski was not only corroborated and credible, but\n\nalso established Carey's participation in the conspiracy.                   Each\n\nwitness' testimony about Carey's involvement in the drug deals was\n\ncorroborated by the fact that the first deal took place at Carey's\n\nhouse; the fact that crack cocaine and cash were found in Carey's\n\nhome at the time of his arrest; and the fact that Carey made\n\nincriminating     statements   which       were   recorded    throughout     the\n\ninvestigation.      In   addition,     while      Powers   and   Mozynski    had\n\nquestionable     backgrounds   that    called      their   credibility      into\n\nquestion, those issues were aired before the jury throughout the\n\ntrial.   The jury also was instructed that it was to assess the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses in reaching a verdict of guilt beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.\n\n          Powers' and Mozynski's testimony further demonstrated\n\nCarey's participation in the conspiracy.             Their testimony showed\n\nthat Carey initiated the drug relationship between Mozynski and the\n\nother members of the conspiracy.            Carey agreed to sell Mozynski\n\ncrack cocaine that he would be getting from Henderson prior to\n\nbeing cut out of the deal.     Powers' testimony further demonstrated\n\nthat Carey distributed crack cocaine from his house throughout the\n\n                                     -8-\n\fperiod of the conspiracy, and that he made more than one hundred\n\ncrack cocaine purchases from Henderson.            Mozynski additionally\n\ntestified that he had purchased crack cocaine from Carey the week\n\nbefore the first charged sale.       Given the sufficiency of Powers'\n\nand Mozynski's testimony, a rational trier of fact could find guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n           Finally,    Carey   asserts   that   Powers'    and    Mozynski's\n\ntestimony did not support a conviction for aiding and abetting in\n\nthe distribution of crack cocaine.         See 21 U.S.C. § 841(a); 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2. We observe, however, that the identical circumstantial\n\nand credibility assessments which permitted the jury to determine\n\nthat Carey conspired with Henderson to possess crack cocaine for\n\ndistribution suffice as well to establish, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, that Carey consciously sought to distribute the crack\n\ncocaine.   See United States v. Arias, 238 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n           2.   Tape Recordings\n\n           We   also   disagree   with   Carey's   claim   that    the   tape\n\nrecordings did not provide additional evidence in support of his\n\nconviction.     Although it is not clear from his brief, the gist of\n\nCarey's argument appears to be that the tape recordings did not\n\nconstitute evidence against him because they were either inaudible,\n\nor, in the alternative, actually exculpatory.        Carey contends that\n\nthe tape recordings were \"all somewhat inaudible\" and \"difficult to\n\n                                   -9-\n\fhear,\" yet in the same breath argues that they somehow show that\n\n\"the defendant did not want any part of the transactions.\"\n\n            In any event, we do not find the statements he allegedly\n\nmade on the recordings exculpatory.      Carey believes those comments\n\n-- \"I don't want nobody around here\" and \"It's got nothing to do\n\nwith me and you know it\" -- indicate that he had no desire to\n\nparticipate in the conspiracy.     Be that as it may, his reliance on\n\nthese remarks is misplaced because they do not constitute a legally\n\nsufficient withdrawal from the conspiracy.        Cf. United States v.\n\nJuodakis, 834 F.2d 1099, 1102 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"[T]o withdraw, a\n\nconspirator must act affirmatively either to defeat or disavow the\n\npurposes of the conspiracy\"); United States v. Dunn, 758 F.2d 30,\n\n37-38 (1st Cir. 1985) (mere disagreement with co-conspirators is\n\ninsufficient to constitute withdrawal from conspiracy).         At best,\n\nCarey's statements constituted some evidence from which the jury\n\ncould have found that he never joined the conspiracy in the first\n\ninstance.   Carey argued as much to the jurors, and they ultimately\n\nrejected this argument.\n\n              Carey   also   attacks   the   transcripts   of   the    tape\n\nrecordings the government provided the jury at the trial.             As he\n\nwould have it, the transcripts should have not been considered as\n\nevidence to support a conviction because they were the government's\n\n\"interpretation\" of the tapes.     Carey overlooks the fact that even\n\nif it mattered who \"interpreted\" the recordings, the transcripts\n\n                                  -10-\n\fare not evidence.       See United States v. Richman, 600 F.2d 286, 295\n\n(1st Cir. 1979). The district court, sensitive to this issue, gave\n\na cautionary instruction to the jury explaining that \"if what you\n\nhear on the tape itself is different from what shows up on the\n\ntranscript,      it's    the   tape   that's   the     evidence,    not     the\n\ntranscripts.\"      Thus, we are satisfied that the transcripts were\n\nproperly utilized by the court.\n\n            3.   Carey's Absence\n\n            Carey further argues that his absence during the drug\n\ndeals indicated that he did not participate in the conspiracy. The\n\nrecord, however, supports a finding of the opposite.             We have said\n\nthat \"proof of direct participation in the sale of drugs is not\n\nrequired to convict in a drug conspiracy case.\"              United States v.\n\nMarrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d 768, 773 (1st Cir. 1998).             Here, there was\n\nsufficient evidence from which a rational juror could find that\n\nCarey conspired with Henderson and Powers to distribute crack\n\ncocaine: Carey had initially set up the October 19, 1998 deal and\n\nhad repeatedly demanded that he be paid for doing so; he first\n\ncontacted   Henderson      about   the   possibility    of    selling     ounce\n\nquantities of crack cocaine to Mozynski; he told Mozynski that \"all\n\nhe needed was 24 hours notice to get the deal done\"; he allowed his\n\nhouse to be used for the October 19, 1998 deal; and he facilitated\n\nthe delivery of the crack cocaine on November 17 in order to avoid\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fa dispute between Henderson and Mozynski over the fraudulent sale\n\nof wax.\n\n             Carey's involvement in the distribution of crack cocaine\n\nwas also corroborated by the following evidence:              the November 16,\n\n1998, tape recording where a third party was heard asking Carey for\n\ncrack cocaine; the crack cocaine and cash found in his house at the\n\ntime    of   his    arrest;    the   intimate     knowledge   he   displayed   of\n\nHenderson's trafficking activities during his taped conversation\n\nwith Mozynski on November 16; the awareness he displayed of other\n\ndrug     transactions       throughout    the     investigation;    and   Powers'\n\ntestimony that she saw Carey buy crack cocaine from Henderson\n\nhundreds of times and that Carey resold it to his own customers.\n\n             In sum, based on the record, we conclude that there was\n\nsufficient evidence for a jury to find Carey guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\nB.     Co-Conspirators' Hearsay Declarations\n\n             Carey argues that the trial court erred by improperly\n\nadmitting co-conspirator statements into evidence because there was\n\nno evidence of a conspiracy.             The court reviews a trial court's\n\ndetermination        that   statements     were    co-conspirator    statements\n\nadmissible pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) under the clear\n\nerror standard.        See United States v. Marino, 277 F.3d 11, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).        A statement offered against a party is not hearsay if\n\nit is \"a statement by a co-conspirator of a party during the course\n\n                                         -12-\n\fand in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).\n\nStatements   of   co-conspirators      are    admissible     under     Rule\n\n801(d)(2)(E) only if the trial court finds it \"more likely than not\n\nthat the declarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy\n\n. . . and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"\n\nUnited States v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1977).\n\nDistrict courts frequently allow co-conspirator statements to be\n\nadmitted   provisionally,   subject    to    the   trial   court's   final\n\nPetrozziello determination, which should be made \"at the close of\n\nall the evidence\" and \"out of the hearing of the jury.\"              United\n\nStates v. Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d 632, 638 (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n           At the close of evidence during the trial, Carey argued\n\nfor the exclusion of the co-conspirators' hearsay statements,\n\nreiterating his claim that the testimony of Mozynski and Powers was\n\ninherently unreliable, and therefore should be excluded.             As we\n\nhave already discussed, each witness testified that Carey was\n\ninvolved in the distribution of crack cocaine and assisted in\n\nsetting up the first sale on October 19.             This testimony was\n\ncorroborated by other evidence.       In light of this evidence, the\n\ndistrict court properly admitted the co-conspirator statements.\n\nC.   The Prosecutor's Closing Argument\n\n           Carey relies exclusively on the identical, and ultimately\n\nunavailing, claims raised by co-defendant Henderson alleging that\n\nthe government's closing argument improperly persuaded the jury to\n\n                                -13-\n\fconvict.    We need not address these arguments here because we have\n\nconsidered, and rejected, them in his co-defendant's companion\n\ncase.    See Henderson, No. 01-2392.\n\nD.    The Amount of Crack Cocaine\n\n            We review factual findings by the sentencing court as to\n\ndrug quantity only for clear error.                  See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at\n\n1196.    The sentencing court has broad discretion to determine what\n\ninformation is \"sufficiently dependable to be used in imposing\n\nsentence.\" United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1287 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).     Because of the impact of quantity on the length of\n\nsentence, the sentencing court must \"err on the side of caution.\"\n\nUnited States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 113 (1st Cir. 1990).                 But if\n\nthe   record     permits   more   than    one       plausible   alternative,   the\n\ndistrict court's choice between them cannot be deemed \"clearly\n\nerroneous.\"      United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49 (1st\n\nCir. 1989).\n\n            A    defendant   convicted         of    conspiracy   to   distribute\n\ncontrolled substances is not automatically burdened with the total\n\nweight of the drugs involved in the conspiracy.                 See Sepulveda, 15\n\nF.3d at 1197. The defendant, instead, is responsible for all drugs\n\nhe personally handled or he anticipated handling, and for drugs\n\ninvolved in additional acts that were reasonably foreseeable by the\n\ndefendant and were committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. Id.\n\nHence,     the     touchstone     for     drug        weight    calculations   is\n\n                                        -14-\n\fforeseeability.      See United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456,\n\n488-89 (1st Cir. 1993). Foreseeability is an inherently fact-bound\n\ndetermination,      and   requires   a     sentencing   court   to     make   an\n\nindividualized inquiry into the details of the conspiracy known by\n\nthe defendant, including his understanding of the object of the\n\nconspiracy    and   its   foreseeable      scope.    See United      States   v.\n\nO'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1026 n.11 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Based on the presentence report (\"PSR\"), the district\n\ncourt included the 19.68 grams from the November 17 transaction\n\n(which forms the basis of Carey's substantive charge) and the 23.7\n\ngrams from the October 19, 1998 transaction (for which Carey was\n\nnot substantively charged) in its determination that Carey was\n\nresponsible for 43.38 grams of crack cocaine. Under the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines, a defendant has a Base Offense Level of 30 when he his\n\nresponsible for \"at least 35 grams but less than 50 Grams of\n\nCocaine Base.\"      U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1 (c)\n\n             Carey attacks his sentence by first arguing that a\n\ndiscrepancy    exists     between    the    jury's   finding    that    he    was\n\nresponsible for between 5 and 50 grams of crack cocaine and the\n\nfact that he was charged only with the distribution of 19.68 grams\n\nof crack cocaine for the transaction on November 17, 1998.              We fail\n\nto see any discrepancy.\n\n             Carey also claims that because he was substantively\n\ncharged for only one of the four transactions (the distribution of\n\n                                     -15-\n\f19.68 grams on November 17), the district court should not have\n\nused   cocaine   quantities    from    the   October   19   transaction   in\n\ncalculating his sentence.      He further argues that the jury did not\n\nfind him guilty of the October 19 transaction.          As we have done in\n\nthe past, we reject this argument.        See United States v. Amirault,\n\n224 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"From the standpoint of due\n\nprocess, a district court may properly consider uncharged conduct\n\nat sentencing as long as that conduct either is admitted or\n\nreliably proved by a preponderance of the evidence\"); see generally\n\nUnited States v. Batista, 239 F.3d 16, 21-22 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied,   534    U.S.   850   (2001)   (sentencing     guidelines   require\n\nconsideration of uncharged amounts of drugs \"by including all\n\namounts that were part of the same course of conduct or common\n\nscheme or plan as the offense of the conviction, whether or not the\n\ndefendant has been charged with those transactions\").           As we have\n\nalready described, Carey was extensively involved in the October 19\n\ntransaction.     Thus, drug quantities from that transaction were\n\nreasonably foreseeable.       See Innamorati, 996 F.2d at 491.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f",

Both were\n\nconvicted and appealed separately.                  Henderson's appeal is also\n\nbefore us, and is the subject of a separate opinion.                        See United\n\nStates v.

THE EVIDENCE\n\n             In October 1998, the Drug Enforcement Administration\n\n(\"DEA\") began an investigation into crack cocaine trafficking in\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts.             Special Agents Timothy Anderson and\n\nRobert Guerard of the DEA used Joseph Mozynski (\"Mozynski\"), a\n\n      1\n       Grams and ounces are used interchangeably throughout this\nopinion. It should be noted that one ounce equals 28.35 grams.\nSee United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, §\n2D1.1, comments. (n.11) (Nov. 2002).\n\n                                         -2-\n\fknown crack cocaine user, to serve as a cooperating witness.\n\nMozynski made four purchases of significant quantities of crack\n\ncocaine during the investigation.            The DEA wired Mozynski with a\n\nconcealed monitoring device that enabled agents to tape record the\n\ndrug transactions.        The first of these drug transactions occurred\n\nat Carey's house on 6 Denny Street.            The subsequent transactions\n\noriginated at Carey's house but were completed at various locations\n\nwithin a two-block radius.\n\n            During      the   first   transaction,   on     October    19,   1998,\n\nMozynski purchased 23.7 grams of crack cocaine from co-defendant\n\nHenderson at Carey's house.             Prior to October 19, Carey told\n\nMozynski that all he needed was \"24 hours notice to get the deal\n\ndone.\"     Mozynski and Carey agreed that Mozynski would pay $1,200\n\nfor   25   grams   of    crack   cocaine,    with   Carey    getting    $200   for\n\nfacilitating the deal, and that Mozynski would pick up the crack\n\ncocaine at Carey's residence.            On October 19, Mozynski entered\n\nCarey's house and met with Carey, co-defendant Powers, and a woman\n\nnamed Lynn Cappulett.         Carey paged Henderson after Mozynski showed\n\nPowers the $1,200.            When Henderson called, Carey answered and\n\nhanded the phone to Powers.           Powers told Henderson that Mozynski\n\nwas there with the money, and then informed Mozynski that Henderson\n\nwould arrive within five minutes.             Henderson called one minute\n\nlater, and Carey again answered the phone and gave it to Powers.\n\nCarey also told Mozynski that he wanted his $200 for setting up the\n\n                                       -3-\n\fdeal.     Shortly thereafter, Henderson arrived at Carey's residence.\n\nHenderson, Mozynski, and Powers went into a bedroom where Henderson\n\ngave Mozynski 23.7 grams of crack cocaine in exchange for $1,200.\n\nHenderson and Mozynski discussed doing larger deals in the future,\n\nand Henderson told Mozynski to contact him through Powers.               Carey\n\nlater became angry because he did not get the $200 he expected to\n\nreceive from the drug deal.          Carey told Powers that he was upset\n\nbecause he had been cut out of the deal and lost money as a result.\n\n             On October 27, 1998, Mozynski met Powers at Carey's\n\nresidence.     Carey told Powers \"I don't want nobody around here,\"\n\nand \"[i]ts got nothing to do with me and you know it.\"             Mozysnki\n\nand Powers left Carey's house and successfully conducted a drug\n\ntransaction with Henderson in the basement of Henderson's apartment\n\nbuilding.      On November 3, 1998, Mozysnki again met Powers at\n\nCarey's house,     but   left   to   conclude   a   drug   transaction    with\n\nHenderson in the basement of his apartment.2\n\n             On November 16, 1988, Mozynski met with Carey and Powers\n\nat Carey's house.     Thereafter, Powers and Mozynski left the house\n\nand   conducted    another   drug    transaction    with   Henderson     at   a\n\ndifferent location, except this time Henderson sold them wax. Once\n\nthe agents realized that Henderson had sold wax rather than crack\n\ncocaine, they directed Mozynski to contact Henderson.              Mozynski\n\n\n      2\n       For a more detailed account of the October 27, and November\n3, 1998, transactions, see Henderson, No. 01-2392.\n\n                                      -4-\n\funsuccessfully attempted to contact Henderson and Powers, and then\n\ncalled Carey.     Carey agreed to call Henderson to \"find out what\n\nhappened.\"     After waiting to get a response by phone, the agents\n\ninstructed Mozynski to go to Carey's residence in order to talk to\n\nCarey directly.\n\n             Mozynski went to Carey's residence three separate times\n\nto speak with Carey.         Thereafter, Carey tried to arrange the\n\ndelivery of crack cocaine from Henderson.          Carey called Henderson\n\non the phone so that Mozynski and Henderson could further discuss\n\nHenderson's delivery of the crack cocaine to Agent Guerard.           Carey\n\neven   provided   Mozynski    with   Henderson's    pager   number,   which\n\nMozynski subsequently gave to Agent Guerard.          Agent Guerard paged\n\nHenderson, who returned the page and promised to deliver one ounce\n\nof crack cocaine on the following day, and two-and-one-half ounces\n\non the day after that.       On November 17, 1998, Mozynski arranged\n\nwith Henderson, through Powers, to receive the one ounce of crack\n\ncocaine promised by Henderson to Agent Guerard.              Mozynski met\n\nPowers on Goulding Street in Worcester, two blocks away from\n\nHenderson's     apartment    building.     Henderson    gave   a   package\n\ncontaining 19.68 grams of crack cocaine to Powers and Powers then\n\ngave the crack cocaine to Mozynski.\n\n             Additional evidence relevant to Carey included testimony\n\nat trial by Powers that she saw Carey sell crack cocaine \"hundreds\n\nof times\" and that his supplier was Henderson.          Powers said that\n\n                                     -5-\n\fshe saw Carey purchase crack cocaine from Henderson at least one\n\nhundred times, and that Carey either used the crack cocaine himself\n\nor resold it to his own customers.           Powers further testified that\n\nboth she and Carey sold crack cocaine out of Carey's residence.\n\n           There was other evidence of Carey's drug sales. Mozynski\n\ntestified that he purchased crack cocaine from Carey on a separate\n\noccasion in early October 1998.            A recorded conversation between\n\nCarey and Mozynski at Carey's house included a statement by a third\n\nperson asking Carey for $20 worth of crack cocaine.              At the time of\n\nCarey's arrest, agents seized quantities of crack cocaine and more\n\nthan $1,000 cash from Carey's house.\n\n                              II.    THE ISSUES\n\nA.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           1.     Testimony of Powers and Mozynski\n\n           Carey     argues   that    the     government's       evidence   was\n\ninsufficient to support the jury verdict against him for conspiracy\n\nto   distribute    crack   cocaine   and    for   aiding   and   abetting   the\n\ndistribution of crack cocaine.        In considering Carey's sufficiency\n\nclaims, we must \"view the evidence, together with all reasonable\n\ninferences that may be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable\n\nto the government\" and consider whether a rational fact finder\n\ncould have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Cruz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596488\"><a href=\"/opinion/596488/united-states-v-joseph-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 616 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).     \"The agreement may be express or tacit and may be\n\nproved by direct or circumstantial evidence.\"     United States v.\n\nSepulveda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          Carey argues that there was no reliable evidence showing\n\nany agreement on his part to enter into a conspiracy to distribute\n\ncrack cocaine.     Specifically, he contends that the testimony of\n\nPowers and Mozynski was \"inherently unreliable,\" and failed to\n\nestablish his participation in the conspiracy.    We disagree.\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          This circuit has held that \"[u]ncorroborated testimony of\n\na cooperating accomplice may sustain a conviction so long as that\n\ntestimony is not facially incredible.\"             United States v. Torres-\n\nGalindo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767957\"><a href=\"/opinion/767957/united-states-v-ricardo-torres-galindo-aka-ricky-silva-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 139-40 (1st Cir. 2000).               The testimony of\n\nPowers and Mozynski was not only corroborated and credible, but\n\nalso established Carey's participation in the conspiracy.                   Each\n\nwitness' testimony about Carey's involvement in the drug deals was\n\ncorroborated by the fact that the first deal took place at Carey's\n\nhouse; the fact that crack cocaine and cash were found in Carey's\n\nhome at the time of his arrest; and the fact that Carey made\n\nincriminating     statements   which       were   recorded    throughout     the\n\ninvestigation.      In   addition,     while      Powers   and   Mozynski    had\n\nquestionable     backgrounds   that    called      their   credibility      into\n\nquestion, those issues were aired before the jury throughout the\n\ntrial.   The jury also was instructed that it was to assess the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses in reaching a verdict of guilt beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.\n\n          Powers' and Mozynski's testimony further demonstrated\n\nCarey's participation in the conspiracy.             Their testimony showed\n\nthat Carey initiated the drug relationship between Mozynski and the\n\nother members of the conspiracy.            Carey agreed to sell Mozynski\n\ncrack cocaine that he would be getting from Henderson prior to\n\nbeing cut out of the deal.     Powers' testimony further demonstrated\n\nthat Carey distributed crack cocaine from his house throughout the\n\n                                     -8-\n\fperiod of the conspiracy, and that he made more than one hundred\n\ncrack cocaine purchases from Henderson.            Mozynski additionally\n\ntestified that he had purchased crack cocaine from Carey the week\n\nbefore the first charged sale.       Given the sufficiency of Powers'\n\nand Mozynski's testimony, a rational trier of fact could find guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n           Finally,    Carey   asserts   that   Powers'    and    Mozynski's\n\ntestimony did not support a conviction for aiding and abetting in\n\nthe distribution of crack cocaine.         See 21 U.S.C. § 841(a); 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2. We observe, however, that the identical circumstantial\n\nand credibility assessments which permitted the jury to determine\n\nthat Carey conspired with Henderson to possess crack cocaine for\n\ndistribution suffice as well to establish, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, that Carey consciously sought to distribute the crack\n\ncocaine.   See United States v. Arias, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199237\"><a href=\"/opinion/199237/united-states-v-arias/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n           2.   Tape Recordings\n\n           We   also   disagree   with   Carey's   claim   that    the   tape\n\nrecordings did not provide additional evidence in support of his\n\nconviction.     Although it is not clear from his brief, the gist of\n\nCarey's argument appears to be that the tape recordings did not\n\nconstitute evidence against him because they were either inaudible,\n\nor, in the alternative, actually exculpatory.        Carey contends that\n\nthe tape recordings were \"all somewhat inaudible\" and \"difficult to\n\n                                   -9-\n\fhear,\" yet in the same breath argues that they somehow show that\n\n\"the defendant did not want any part of the transactions.\"\n\n            In any event, we do not find the statements he allegedly\n\nmade on the recordings exculpatory.      Carey believes those comments\n\n-- \"I don't want nobody around here\" and \"It's got nothing to do\n\nwith me and you know it\" -- indicate that he had no desire to\n\nparticipate in the conspiracy.     Be that as it may, his reliance on\n\nthese remarks is misplaced because they do not constitute a legally\n\nsufficient withdrawal from the conspiracy.        Cf. United States v.\n\nJuodakis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498383\"><a href=\"/opinion/498383/united-states-v-aloyisius-juodakis/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1099</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1102 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"[T]o withdraw, a\n\nconspirator must act affirmatively either to defeat or disavow the\n\npurposes of the conspiracy\"); United States v. Dunn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"449678\"><a href=\"/opinion/449678/united-states-v-john-f-dunn-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n37-38 (1st Cir. 1985) (mere disagreement with co-conspirators is\n\ninsufficient to constitute withdrawal from conspiracy).         At best,\n\nCarey's statements constituted some evidence from which the jury\n\ncould have found that he never joined the conspiracy in the first\n\ninstance.   Carey argued as much to the jurors, and they ultimately\n\nrejected this argument.\n\n              Carey   also   attacks   the   transcripts   of   the    tape\n\nrecordings the government provided the jury at the trial.             As he\n\nwould have it, the transcripts should have not been considered as\n\nevidence to support a conviction because they were the government's\n\n\"interpretation\" of the tapes.     Carey overlooks the fact that even\n\nif it mattered who \"interpreted\" the recordings, the transcripts\n\n                                  -10-\n\fare not evidence.       See United States v. Richman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"367065\"><a href=\"/opinion/367065/united-states-v-harold-richman-united-states-of-america-v-george-pappas/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 295\n\n(1st Cir. 1979). The district court, sensitive to this issue, gave\n\na cautionary instruction to the jury explaining that \"if what you\n\nhear on the tape itself is different from what shows up on the\n\ntranscript,      it's    the   tape   that's   the     evidence,    not     the\n\ntranscripts.\"      Thus, we are satisfied that the transcripts were\n\nproperly utilized by the court.\n\n            3.   Carey's Absence\n\n            Carey further argues that his absence during the drug\n\ndeals indicated that he did not participate in the conspiracy. The\n\nrecord, however, supports a finding of the opposite.             We have said\n\nthat \"proof of direct participation in the sale of drugs is not\n\nrequired to convict in a drug conspiracy case.\"              United States v.\n\nMarrero-Ortiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198207\"><a href=\"/opinion/198207/united-states-v-marrero-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 773 (1st Cir. 1998).             Here, there was\n\nsufficient evidence from which a rational juror could find that\n\nCarey conspired with Henderson and Powers to distribute crack\n\ncocaine: Carey had initially set up the October 19, 1998 deal and\n\nhad repeatedly demanded that he be paid for doing so; he first\n\ncontacted   Henderson      about   the   possibility    of    selling     ounce\n\nquantities of crack cocaine to Mozynski; he told Mozynski that \"all\n\nhe needed was 24 hours notice to get the deal done\"; he allowed his\n\nhouse to be used for the October 19, 1998 deal; and he facilitated\n\nthe delivery of the crack cocaine on November 17 in order to avoid\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fa dispute between Henderson and Mozynski over the fraudulent sale\n\nof wax.\n\n             Carey's involvement in the distribution of crack cocaine\n\nwas also corroborated by the following evidence:              the November 16,\n\n1998, tape recording where a third party was heard asking Carey for\n\ncrack cocaine; the crack cocaine and cash found in his house at the\n\ntime    of   his    arrest;    the   intimate     knowledge   he   displayed   of\n\nHenderson's trafficking activities during his taped conversation\n\nwith Mozynski on November 16; the awareness he displayed of other\n\ndrug     transactions       throughout    the     investigation;    and   Powers'\n\ntestimony that she saw Carey buy crack cocaine from Henderson\n\nhundreds of times and that Carey resold it to his own customers.\n\n             In sum, based on the record, we conclude that there was\n\nsufficient evidence for a jury to find Carey guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\nB.     Co-Conspirators' Hearsay Declarations\n\n             Carey argues that the trial court erred by improperly\n\nadmitting co-conspirator statements into evidence because there was\n\nno evidence of a conspiracy.             The court reviews a trial court's\n\ndetermination        that   statements     were    co-conspirator    statements\n\nadmissible pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) under the clear\n\nerror standard.        See United States v. Marino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199776\"><a href=\"/opinion/199776/united-states-v-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).        A statement offered against a party is not hearsay if\n\nit is \"a statement by a co-conspirator of a party during the course\n\n                                         -12-\n\fand in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).\n\nStatements   of   co-conspirators      are    admissible     under     Rule\n\n801(d)(2)(E) only if the trial court finds it \"more likely than not\n\nthat the declarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy\n\n. . . and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"\n\nUnited States v. Petrozziello, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342283\"><a href=\"/opinion/342283/united-states-v-ralph-petrozziello/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1st Cir. 1977).\n\nDistrict courts frequently allow co-conspirator statements to be\n\nadmitted   provisionally,   subject    to    the   trial   court's   final\n\nPetrozziello determination, which should be made \"at the close of\n\nall the evidence\" and \"out of the hearing of the jury.\"              United\n\nStates v. Ciampaglia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"381348\"><a href=\"/opinion/381348/united-states-v-paul-ciampaglia-united-states-of-america-v-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 638 (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n           At the close of evidence during the trial, Carey argued\n\nfor the exclusion of the co-conspirators' hearsay statements,\n\nreiterating his claim that the testimony of Mozynski and Powers was\n\ninherently unreliable, and therefore should be excluded.             As we\n\nhave already discussed, each witness testified that Carey was\n\ninvolved in the distribution of crack cocaine and assisted in\n\nsetting up the first sale on October 19.             This testimony was\n\ncorroborated by other evidence.       In light of this evidence, the\n\ndistrict court properly admitted the co-conspirator statements.\n\nC.   The Prosecutor's Closing Argument\n\n           Carey relies exclusively on the identical, and ultimately\n\nunavailing, claims raised by co-defendant Henderson alleging that\n\nthe government's closing argument improperly persuaded the jury to\n\n                                -13-\n\fconvict.    We need not address these arguments here because we have\n\nconsidered, and rejected, them in his co-defendant's companion\n\ncase.    See Henderson, No. 01-2392.\n\nD.    The Amount of Crack Cocaine\n\n            We review factual findings by the sentencing court as to\n\ndrug quantity only for clear error.                  See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at\n\n1196.    The sentencing court has broad discretion to determine what\n\ninformation is \"sufficiently dependable to be used in imposing\n\nsentence.\" United States v. Tardiff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587242\"><a href=\"/opinion/587242/united-states-v-claude-paul-tardiff/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1287 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).     Because of the impact of quantity on the length of\n\nsentence, the sentencing court must \"err on the side of caution.\"\n\nUnited States v. Sklar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 (1st Cir. 1990).                 But if\n\nthe   record     permits   more   than    one       plausible   alternative,   the\n\ndistrict court's choice between them cannot be deemed \"clearly\n\nerroneous.\"      United States v. Diaz-Villafane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522865\"><a href=\"/opinion/522865/united-states-v-wilfredo-diaz-villafane/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 49 (1st\n\nCir. 1989).\n\n            A    defendant   convicted         of    conspiracy   to   distribute\n\ncontrolled substances is not automatically burdened with the total\n\nweight of the drugs involved in the conspiracy.                 See Sepulveda, 15\n\nF.3d at 1197. The defendant, instead, is responsible for all drugs\n\nhe personally handled or he anticipated handling, and for drugs\n\ninvolved in additional acts that were reasonably foreseeable by the\n\ndefendant and were committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. Id.\n\nHence,     the     touchstone     for     drug        weight    calculations   is\n\n                                        -14-\n\fforeseeability.      See United States v.

Foreseeability is an inherently fact-bound\n\ndetermination,      and   requires   a     sentencing   court   to     make   an\n\nindividualized inquiry into the details of the conspiracy known by\n\nthe defendant, including his understanding of the object of the\n\nconspiracy    and   its   foreseeable      scope.    See United      States   v.\n\nO'Campo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589965\"><a href=\"/opinion/589965/united-states-v-claudia-ocampo-united-states-v-julian-redeondo/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1026 n.11 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Based on the presentence report (\"PSR\"), the district\n\ncourt included the 19.68 grams from the November 17 transaction\n\n(which forms the basis of Carey's substantive charge) and the 23.7\n\ngrams from the October 19, 1998 transaction (for which Carey was\n\nnot substantively charged) in its determination that Carey was\n\nresponsible for 43.38 grams of crack cocaine. Under the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines, a defendant has a Base Offense Level of 30 when he his\n\nresponsible for \"at least 35 grams but less than 50 Grams of\n\nCocaine Base.\"      U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1 (c)\n\n             Carey attacks his sentence by first arguing that a\n\ndiscrepancy    exists     between    the    jury's   finding    that    he    was\n\nresponsible for between 5 and 50 grams of crack cocaine and the\n\nfact that he was charged only with the distribution of 19.68 grams\n\nof crack cocaine for the transaction on November 17, 1998.              We fail\n\nto see any discrepancy.\n\n             Carey also claims that because he was substantively\n\ncharged for only one of the four transactions (the distribution of\n\n                                     -15-\n\f19.68 grams on November 17), the district court should not have\n\nused   cocaine   quantities    from    the   October   19   transaction   in\n\ncalculating his sentence.      He further argues that the jury did not\n\nfind him guilty of the October 19 transaction.          As we have done in\n\nthe past, we reject this argument.        See United States v.
