William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Chauncey B. Wood, with whom Wood & Nathanson, LLP, was on\nbrief for petitioner/appellant.\n     James J. Arguin, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau,\nwith whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General, were on brief for\nrespondent/appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         August 12, 2010\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.             In 2002, a Massachusetts\n\nSuperior Court jury convicted Thomas Junta (\"Junta\") of involuntary\n\nmanslaughter on the theory of unlawful killing by the commission of\n\na   battery.     See     Mass.   Gen.    Laws   ch.   265,   §   13.      After\n\nunsuccessfully appealing his conviction, Junta petitioned for a\n\nwrit of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254.                Junta now\n\nappeals from the denial of his federal petition for habeas corpus\n\nrelief.   The sole question before us is whether the Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court's rejection of Junta's claim that the prosecution\n\nsuppressed exculpatory evidence in violation of Brady v. Maryland,\n\n373 U.S. 83 (1963) violated the deferential standard of review set\n\nforth for habeas claims in the AntiTerrorism and Effective Death\n\nPenalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214.\n\nWe find it did not and thus affirm the denial of habeas corpus\n\nrelief by the district court.\n\n                                 I. Background\n\n           A.   Facts1\n\n           On the afternoon of July 5, 2000, Junta took his ten-year\n\nold son and two friends to the Burbank Ice Arena in Reading,\n\n\n\n1\n   In habeas cases, \"a determination of a factual issue made by a\nState court shall be presumed to be correct.\"           28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(e)(1). This presumption of correctness applies to findings\nof facts made by state trial and appellate courts. Teti v. Bender,\n507 F.3d 50, 58-59 (1st Cir. 2007). As a result, \"[w]e describe\nthe facts as they appear from the state court record.\" Id. at 53.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fMassachusetts for \"stick practice,\" an informal hockey practice.\n\nCommonwealth v. Junta, 815 N.E.2d 254, 256 (Mass. App. Ct. 2004).\n\nDuring the practice, Junta watched from the stands.                   Junta, after\n\nwatching the game for a period of time, believed the game had\n\nbecome too rough and went down to ice-level to complain to Michael\n\nCostin (\"Costin\"), an adult who was participating in the practice\n\nwith his three sons.       Id.    Costin responded, \"That's hockey.\"            Id.\n\nThe men exchanged words, but no physical altercation took place at\n\nthat time.\n\n             The practice ended shortly thereafter, and the players\n\nreturned to the locker room.             While the players were changing out\n\nof   their   hockey     gear,    Junta    and    Costin   again    confronted   one\n\nanother, first verbally and then physically.                Other nearby adults\n\nbroke up the fight.       Junta departed the arena, leaving his son to\n\nfinish changing in the locker room, only to return a few minutes\n\nlater.       Id.   at    257.          Upon     his   return,     Nancy   Blanchard\n\n(\"Blanchard\"), a rink employee, noted that Junta \"appeared angry.\"\n\nId. Junta found Costin, and the two men immediately began throwing\n\npunches at one another.          Id.\n\n             There was conflicting trial testimony as to which of the\n\ntwo men was the first aggressor.                Id.   Junta claimed that Costin\n\nattacked him first, while witnesses for the Commonwealth alleged\n\nthat it was Junta who first grabbed Costin.                     Id.   Costin, who\n\nweighed approximately 160 pounds, wound up on the ground with\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fJunta, who weighed approximately 270 pounds, straddled on top of\n\nhim.    Id.     Costin was punched numerous times in the face and\n\nelsewhere.\n\n              Also at issue at the trial was the number of blows Junta\n\nstruck. Blanchard and other witnesses testified that Junta punched\n\nCostin \"many, many times,\" while Junta and his witnesses claimed\n\nthat   only    \"two   or   three\"   punches   had   been   inflicted.   Id.\n\nBlanchard and another witness asked Junta to stop, screaming,\n\n\"you're going to kill him.\"         Id.\n\n              Costin did not succumb immediately to Junta's blows.\n\nAccording to several witnesses, \"there was a period during that\n\npunching that [Costin] was moving, fighting, kicking, or flailing.\"\n\nId.    By the time that bystanders pulled Junta away from Costin,\n\nCostin was motionless.          Emergency medical technicians and an\n\nadvanced life support team treated Costin while en route to the\n\nhospital, but Costin died the next day.\n\n              The number and nature of the blows inflicted were viewed\n\nas crucial.       \"The law of [the Commonwealth of Massachusetts]\n\nrecognizes unlawful-act manslaughter only if the unlawful act is a\n\nbattery not amounting to a felony, when the defendant knew or\n\nshould have known that the battery he was committing endangered\n\nhuman life.\" Id. (quoting Commonwealth v. Sires, 596 N.E.2d 1018,\n\n1024 n.10 (Mass. 1992)).        As a result, if Junta inflicted only a\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fsingle punch or minor blows, it would tend to negate his knowledge\n\nor imputed knowledge.\n\n            The expert testimony at trial differed as to the number\n\nof blows.    Dr. Stanton Kessler of the Commonwealth's Office of the\n\nChief    Medical   Examiner,   the   expert   for   the   prosecution,   had\n\nperformed the autopsy.     Dr. Kessler testified that, in addition to\n\nthe numerous injuries on Costin's body, there were two areas of\n\nsevere trauma: the base of the neck where the vertebral artery\n\nruptured, cutting off twenty-five percent of the blood supply to\n\nthe brain, and internal trauma to the left side of the head above\n\nthe ear.    Junta, 815 N.E.2d at 257.      The latter injury, unrelated\n\nto the former, resulted in \"severe\" and \"serious\" bleeding of the\n\nbrain.     Id.   The cause of death, in his opinion, was \"blunt head\n\nand neck trauma, contributory factor of bronchopneumonia [i.e.,\n\nfluid in the lungs].\"     Id. at 257-58.      Although he acknowledged on\n\nseveral occasions that the injury to the vertebral artery could\n\nhave been sustained by one blow, he testified that the tearing of\n\nthe ligaments, \"almost tearing the head from the neck,\" indicated\n\nmultiple blows.     Id. at 258.\n\n            Dr. Ira Kanfer, the defense expert, testified that the\n\ncause of death was rupture of the vertebral artery, a rare injury\n\ncaused by minimal force, due to a single blow.            Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f            B.     Procedural History\n\n            On January 11, 2002, a Massachusetts Superior Court jury\n\nconvicted Junta of involuntary manslaughter on the theory of\n\nunlawful killing by the commission of a battery.            Id. at 256; see\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 13.         Junta was sentenced to serve six to\n\nten years at the Massachusetts Correction Institution - Cedar\n\nJunction.     Junta, 815 N.E.2d at 256.\n\n            On February 10, 2003, Junta filed a motion for new trial.\n\nIn support of his motion for a new trial, Junta submitted the\n\naffidavit of Melissa Christie (\"Christie\"), who worked at the\n\nOffice of the Chief Medical Examiner.            She alleged that she had\n\nattended      an   American   Academy    of    Forensic   Science    (\"AAFS\")\n\nconference in Seattle, Washington, where Dr. Kessler had given a\n\npresentation on the technique for evaluating vertebral artery\n\ntrauma   at      autopsy.2    During     his   presentation,   Dr.   Kessler\n\n\"identified the case for the audience as being the famous 'Hockey\n\nDad's' case in Massachusetts,\" and showed slides of Costin's\n\n\n2\n   In the abstract of the presentation, Through the Tight Canal\nSwiftly – A Review of the Technique for Evaluating Vertebral Artery\nTrauma Autopsy, Dr. Kessler and his co-author wrote:\n\n     To make this diagnosis [of traumatic basilar subarachnoid\n     hemorrhage, secondary to vertebral artery injuries] there\n     must not be any other traumatic injury to the brain,\n     dural coverings, spinal cord, or skull. Typical terminal\n     events usually relate to a fight in which the victim has\n     received only minor blows to the head from an assailant.\n     The victim may then be witnessed to collapse, develop\n     seizures and either die immediately or linger brain dead\n     in a surgical intensive care unit. . . .\n\n                                       -6-\n\finjuries.    Id. at 258.      He identified the rupture of the vertebral\n\nartery as the fatal injury and indicated that the injury can easily\n\noccur during a chiropractor visit.                Id.     According to Christie,\n\n\"[t]here    was    nothing    in   his    talk    about    substantial      force    or\n\nmultiple blows having caused the rupture of Mr. Costin's vertebral\n\nartery.\" Id. Following a non-evidentiary hearing, the trial judge\n\ndenied Junta's motion.        Junta filed a notice of appeal, and his two\n\nappeals –- the first from his conviction and the second from the\n\ndenial of his motion for new trial –- were consolidated.                              On\n\nSeptember    23,    2004,    the   Massachusetts         Appeals   Court       affirmed\n\nJunta's conviction and denied his motion for new trial.                    See id. at\n\n262. Junta subsequently filed with the Massachusetts Supreme Court\n\nan application for leave to obtain further appellate review, which\n\nthe court denied.\n\n            Having     exhausted         his     state     court       remedies,     on\n\nFebruary 15, 2006, Junta filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2254\n\nfor a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Massachusetts.            In his petition, Junta set forth a\n\nsingle claim based on the prosecution's alleged failure to disclose\n\nexculpatory    evidence      in    violation     of     Brady,   373    U.S.    at   87.\n\nSpecifically,      Junta     alleged     that    the     prosecution     effectively\n\nsuppressed the fact that Dr. Kessler had presented his findings in\n\nthis case at an AAFS conference, and that the findings presented at\n\nthe conference contradicted his trial testimony, thus depriving\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fJunta of valuable impeachment evidence.          The district court denied\n\nthe petition.    Junta v. Thompson, 647 F. Supp. 2d 94, 102 (D. Mass.\n\n2009). Junta thereafter requested, and the district court granted,\n\na certificate of appealability on the Brady issue.\n\n                               II. Discussion\n\n           A.    Standard of Review\n\n           We review the district court's denial of habeas relief de\n\nnovo.   Aspen v. Bissonnette, 480 F.3d 571, 573 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n           As a threshold matter, we must determine the proper\n\nstandard   of    review   with   which    to   review   the   state    court's\n\ndisposition     of   Junta's   appeal.     Under   AEDPA,     \"the    level   of\n\ndeference owed to a state court decision [on federal habeas review]\n\nhinges on whether the state court ever adjudicated the relevant\n\nclaim on the merits or not.\"       Clements v. Clarke, 592 F.3d 45, 52\n\n(1st Cir. 2010) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)).           If the state court\n\nhas adjudicated the claim on the merits, a federal habeas court\n\nmust defer to the state court adjudication unless it:\n\n           (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary\n           to, or involved an unreasonable application\n           of, clearly established Federal law, as\n           determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n           States; or\n\n           (2) resulted in a decision that was based on\n           an unreasonable determination of the facts in\n           light of the evidence presented in the State\n           court proceeding.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).       \"In contrast, a state court decision that\n\ndoes not address the federal claim on the merits falls beyond the\n\n                                    -8-\n\fambit of AEDPA,\" Clements, 592 F.3d at 52, and the habeas court\n\nreviews such a claim de novo.           Fortini v. Murphy, 257 F.3d 39, 47\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           The    Supreme      Judicial      Court    for   the     Commonwealth        of\n\nMassachusetts     denied      Junta's    application        for   leave    to    obtain\n\nfurther appellate review, and thus, we \"look through to the last\n\nreasoned decision\" to determine the basis for the state court's\n\nholding.      Malone v. Clarke, 536 F.3d 54, 63 n.6 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(internal quotations omitted).                 As a result, we turn to the\n\ndecision of the Massachusetts Appeals Court.\n\n           As to both Dr. Kessler's presentation and the abstract of\n\nhis presentation, Junta contends that we must review his Brady\n\nclaims de novo.       With respect to the presentation, Junta contends\n\nthat the Massachusetts Appeals Court did not address whether the\n\nalleged suppression of Dr. Kessler's presentation violated Brady.\n\nAs to the abstract, Junta alleges that the Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt   did    not    examine     whether       the   prosecution         effectively\n\nsuppressed Dr. Kessler's abstract by disclosing it to defense\n\ncounsel on the last page of Dr. Kessler's updated C.V. on the\n\nmorning of his testimony, thereby ignoring the second prong of the\n\nBrady analysis.       We disagree.\n\n           The Massachusetts Appeals Court addressed Junta's claim\n\nexplaining     that   due   process     is     violated     under    Brady      \"if    the\n\nprosecution      fails   to    produce       'evidence      which    provides         some\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fsignificant aid to the defendant's case, whether it furnishes\n\ncorroboration of the defendant's story, calls into question a\n\nmaterial, although not indispensable, element of the prosecution's\n\nversion of the events, or challenges the credibility of a key\n\nprosecution     witness.'\"      Junta,      815   N.E.2d     at    259.     The\n\nMassachusetts    Appeals     Court   then   addressed      the    Brady   issue,\n\nstating:\n\n           After examining Dr. Kessler's testimony and\n           the abstract, we conclude, as did the motion\n           judge (who was also the trial judge), that the\n           defendant has not met his burden.          The\n           abstract   is   not  inconsistent    with  Dr.\n           Kessler's   testimony,   and,   moreover,  the\n           defendant overstates the factual importance of\n           the experts' testimony in this case. Although\n           the defendant urges that Dr. Kessler testified\n           that multiple blows caused the rupture of the\n           vertebral artery, he did not so testify. What\n           led him to the conclusion of multiple blows\n           was the fact that there were also other\n           injuries including \"the injury in the middle\n           of the brain.\"      He stated, \"Taking into\n           account the tearing of the small vessels in\n           the cavity of the brain we call the ventricle.\n           Taking into account the amount of blood and\n           tearing of the vertebral injury and the\n           bruising and hemorrhage in the vertebral\n           arteries on both sides. And the hemorrhage in\n           the neck. This is a substantial force injury.\n           It takes a lot of trauma to tear ligaments and\n           the ligaments at the back of the skull are\n           torn and hemorrhaged.\"      That the abstract\n           reported that tearing of the vertebral artery\n           may typically be caused by minor blows in no\n           way contradicts Dr. Kessler's testimony that\n           due to the severity of the injuries in this\n           case, multiple blows were here inflicted.\n\n           Perhaps even more important, the testimony of\n           the percipient witnesses belied the claim of\n           one or minimal blows.   No witness testified\n\n                                     -10-\n\f           that the defendant hit Costin only once, and\n           the defendant himself testified that there\n           were two or three punches.      Both experts\n           pointed out that once the vertebral artery is\n           ruptured, the victim would within seconds\n           become unconscious or brain dead.     As the\n           trial judge pointed out in his well-reasoned\n           memorandum denying a new trial,\n\n           \"there was substantial eye testimony that the\n           victim was still moving after a minimum of two\n           punches. There was also substantial testimony\n           from eyewitnesses that [the defendant] punched\n           the victim anywhere from three up to ten or\n           more times.      Therefore, the information\n           contained in Dr. Kessler's [a]bstract would\n           not have provided [the defendant] with\n           effective impeachment material.\"\n\nId. at 259-60 (footnote omitted).\n\n           A matter is \"adjudicated on the merits\" if there is a\n\n\"decision finally resolving the parties' claims, with res judicata\n\neffect, that is based on the substance of the claim advanced,\n\nrather than on a procedural, or other, ground.\"               Teti, 507 F.3d at\n\n56   (internal       quotations   and    citation     omitted).       Here,    the\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court's treatment of Junta's Brady claim\n\nconstituted      a     final    decision       with   res     judicata      effect.\n\nAdditionally, the court relied on substantive grounds in reaching\n\nits decision.        \"Thus, this was neither a disposition on procedural\n\ngrounds   nor    a    summary   disposition      in   which   the   court   simply\n\nremained silent on the issue.\"           Clements, 592 F.3d at 53.\n\n           Moreover, we have previously stated that\n\n           AEDPA's trigger for deferential review is\n           adjudication, not explanation. When a state\n           court has truly avoided (or merely overlooked)\n\n                                        -11-\n\f             the petitioner's federal claim, a federal\n             court may step into the breach and review de\n             novo. But judicial opacity is a far cry from\n             judicial avoidance. It is the result to which\n             we owe deference, not the opinion expounding\n             it.\n\nId. at 55-56 (internal citation omitted).                 Thus, the question\n\nbefore us is not whether the state court opinion engaged in the\n\ncomprehensive      analysis     typically     required    of   \"a    law   school\n\nexamination,\" Rashad v. Walsh, 300 F.3d 27, 45 (1st Cir. 2002), but\n\nwhether the substance of Junta's federal claims was addressed.\n\nBecause we find that the Massachusetts Appeals Court addressed the\n\neffective suppression of Dr. Kessler's C.V.,3 and the suppression\n\nof   both    the   abstract     and     the   substance   of   Dr.     Kessler's\n\npresentation, through the lens of Brady, see Junta, 815 N.E.2d at\n\n259-60,     we   review   the   state    court's   decision     under      AEDPA's\n\ndeferential standard of review.4\n\n\n3\n   In addressing Junta's claim that the Government effectively\nsuppressed the updated copy of Dr. Kessler's C.V. by providing a\ncopy of the C.V. at trial, the Massachusetts Appeals Court\nexplained that the prosecution \"in fact provided defense counsel\nwith an updated copy of Dr. Kessler's curriculum vitae on the\nmorning of his testimony [but that] [t]here were \"conflicting\naffidavits as to whether the prosecution had pointed out to the\ndefense the addition of the abstract to the curriculum vitae.\"\nJunta, 815 N.E.2d at 259 n.6. The Massachusetts Appeals Court,\nhowever, did not decide whether the untimely disclosure of the C.V.\namounted to an effective suppression of the C.V.      Instead, the\nMassachusetts Appeals Court adopted the motion judge's reasoning\nthat \"even assuming all of the facts alleged by [Junta] are true,\n[he] has failed to show that the Commonwealth's nondisclosure of\nDr. Kessler's abstract caused him prejudice.'\" Id.\n4\n   We note that the district court reviewed Junta's Brady claim\nregarding the suppression of Dr. Kessler's presentation de novo.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f            B.   The Brady Claim\n\n            We now turn to the merits of Junta's claim.                  Junta\n\ncontends that the prosecution effectively suppressed exculpatory\n\nevidence in violation of his due process rights.          Specifically, he\n\nmaintains that Dr. Kessler's abstract and presentation, viewed\n\ntogether,    provided    valuable     impeachment   evidence   because   they\n\ncontradicted Dr. Kessler's testimony at trial.\n\n            Junta does not contend that the state court's rejection\n\nof his Brady claim was \"contrary to\" clearly established Supreme\n\nCourt precedent, and thus we limit our inquiry to whether the state\n\ncourt's   decision      was    an   \"unreasonable   application   of\"    such\n\nprecedent.    \"A state court decision is an unreasonable application\n\nof the governing law if the state court identifies the correct\n\ngoverning legal principle from the Supreme Court's then-current\n\ndecisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of\n\nthe prisoner's case.\"         Aspen, 480 F.3d at 574.    The Supreme Court\n\n\nSee Junta, 647 F. Supp. 2d 94 at 99. The district court explained\nthat although the Massachusetts Appeals Court examined the evidence\nregarding the presentation, it declined to issue separate findings\non materiality.    A review of the Massachusetts Appeals Court\ndecision reveals, however, that the court addressed the substance\nof the presentation in light of Junta's Brady claim, but declined\nto issue additional findings given that the presentation had not\nbeen recorded. Junta, 815 N.E.2d at 259 n.4. Because we find that\nthe Massachusetts Appeals Court addressed Junta's claim regarding\nDr. Kessler's presentation in light of Brady, we decline to follow\nthe district court's decision to review this aspect of the\nMassachusetts Appeals Court decision de novo. Moreover, we note\nthat the district court rejected Junta's claim under de novo\nreview, finding that no Brady violation had occurred. Junta, 647\nF. Supp. 2d 94 at 102.\n\n                                      -13-\n\fhas emphasized that \"an unreasonable application of federal law is\n\ndifferent from an incorrect application of federal law.\"                Williams\n\nv. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 410 (2000) (emphasis in original).                Thus,\n\n\"[a] decision can still be reasonable even if the reviewing court\n\nthinks it is wrong; 'unreasonable' here means something more than\n\nincorrect or erroneous.\"         Teti, 507 F.3d at 57 (citation omitted).\n\nIf there is \"a close question [as to] whether the state decision is\n\nin   error,    then   the     state   decision   cannot   be   an   unreasonable\n\napplication.\"       Healy v. Spencer, 453 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n              The   clearly    established     law   governing   the   mandatory\n\ndisclosure of exculpatory evidence is set forth in Brady, 373 U.S.\n\nat 87.    The Supreme Court has identified a three-part test for\n\nadjudicating Brady claims: (1) \"[t]he evidence at issue must be\n\nfavorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or\n\nbecause it is impeaching;\" (2) \"that evidence must have been\n\nsuppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently;\" and\n\n(3) \"prejudice must have ensued.\"              Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S.\n\n263, 281-82 (1999).\n\n              At the outset, we note that there is a dispute as to\n\nwhether the Brady obligation extends to prosecution experts, such\n\nas a medical examiner.5           Assuming arguendo that Brady applies,\n\n\n5\n  The Supreme Court has previously stated that the phrase \"clearly\nestablished as determined by [the Supreme] Court refers to\nholdings, as opposed to the dicta, of [the Supreme] Court's\n\n                                        -14-\n\fthere is nothing to suggest that the Massachusetts Appeals Court\n\nunreasonably applied Brady.\n\n          It was not unreasonable for the Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt to conclude that Dr. Kessler's C.V., the abstract, and the\n\nsubstance of Dr. Kessler's presentation were not favorable to\n\nJunta, given that they were not inconsistent with Dr. Kessler's\n\ntestimony.   At trial, Dr. Kessler conceded on several occasions\n\nthat Costin's fatal injury, rupture of the vertebral artery, could\n\nhave been caused by minimal force or a single blow.   Furthermore,\n\nDr. Kessler's opinion that Junta used substantial force was based\n\n\n\ndecisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\"\nYarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 660-61 (2004) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). In Kyles v. Whitley, the\nSupreme Court held that the prosecution's Brady obligation extends\neven to \"evidence known only to police investigators and not to the\nprosecutor.\" 514 U.S. 419, 438 (1995). The Court noted that \"the\nindividual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence\nknown to the others acting on the government's behalf in the case,\nincluding the police.\"    Id. at 437.   Junta relies, in part, on\nCommonwealth v. Woodward, 694 N.E.2d 1277, 1292 (Mass. 1998), for\nthe proposition that a medical examiner is a government \"agent,\"\nbut this case obviously does not present \"clearly established\nFederal law.\" The government, on the other hand, argues that, in\naddition to there not being guidance from the Court as to who may\nbe considered to be \"acting on the government's behalf,\" courts are\ndivided as to whether evidence in the possession of a medical\nexaminer may be attributed to the prosecution for Brady purposes.\nCompare People v. Stern, 704 N.Y.S.2d 569, 579 (N.Y. App. Div.\n2000) (holding that documents in the possession of a medical\nexaminer cannot be attributed to the prosecution because the Office\nof Medical Examiners is \"not a law enforcement agency\"), with\nWoodward, 694 N.E.2d at 1292 (holding that a medical examiner was\n\"a Commonwealth agent\" for purposes of a failure to preserve\nevidence claim).    Because we assume, arguendo, that a medical\nexaminer falls within the Brady purview and address the merits of\nJunta's Brady claim, we need not resolve this issue.\n\n                               -15-\n\fon all the injuries Costin incurred, not merely on the vertebral\n\nartery   rupture.   Likewise,    Dr.    Kessler's   opinion   that   Junta\n\ninflicted multiple blows was not based on the rupture of the\n\nvertebral artery, but on the fact that Dr. Kessler found fifteen\n\nareas of trauma throughout Costin's body.\n\n           The Massachusetts Appeals Court reasonably concluded that\n\nthe materials would not have undermined Dr. Kessler's opinion that\n\nJunta had used substantial force and inflicted multiple blows. But\n\nmore importantly, as the Massachusetts Appeals Court noted, Junta\n\n\"overstates the factual importance of the experts' testimony in\n\nthis case.\"   Junta, 815 N.E.2d at 259.      Junta, outweighing Costin\n\nby more than one hundred pounds, straddled Costin and \"punched\n\n[him] anywhere from three up to ten or more times,\" even after two\n\nwitnesses had screamed at Junta to stop because he was \"going to\n\nkill [Costin]\" and the latter remained motionless.            Id. at 257,\n\n260.     Given these circumstances, putting aside Dr. Kessler's\n\ntestimony, there was substantial evidence for the jury to conclude\n\nthat Junta knew or should have known that the battery he was\n\ncommitting endangered Costin's life.        The materials do not call\n\nthis conclusion into question.    Thus, it was not unreasonable for\n\nthe Massachusetts Appeals Court to conclude that these materials\n\ndid not provide effective impeachment or exculpatory evidence.6\n\n\n6\n  Given that the materials are not favorable to Junta, we need not\ndecide whether the prosecution \"effectively\" disclosed the abstract\nby providing a copy of the C.V. at trial.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f          In sum, we cannot say that the Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt's treatment of the Brady issue was unreasonable.\n\n                           III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of habeas relief.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f",

Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 13. After unsuccessfully appealing his conviction, Junta petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254. Junta now appeals from the denial of his federal petition for habeas corpus relief. The sole question before us is whether the Massachusetts Appeals Court's rejection of Junta's claim that the prosecution suppressed exculpatory evidence in violation of <i>Brady</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> <i>v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) violated the deferential standard of review set forth for habeas claims in the AntiTerrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214. We find it did not and thus affirm the denial of habeas corpus relief by the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Facts<sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p>On the afternoon of July 5, 2000, Junta took his ten-year old son and two friends to the Burbank Ice Arena in Reading, Massachusetts for \"stick practice,\" an informal hockey practice. <i>Commonwealth v. Junta,</i> 62 Mass.App.Ct. 120, 815 N.E.2d 254, 256 (2004). During the practice, Junta watched from the stands. Junta, after watching the game for a period of time, believed the game had become too rough and went down to ice-level to complain to Michael Costin (\"Costin\"), an adult who was participating in the practice with his three sons. <i>Id.</i> Costin responded, \"That's hockey.\" <i>Id.</i> The men exchanged words, but no physical altercation took place at that time.</p>\n<p>The practice ended shortly thereafter, and the players returned to the locker room. While the players were changing out of their hockey gear, Junta and Costin again confronted one another, first verbally and then physically. Other nearby adults broke up the fight. Junta departed the arena, leaving his son to finish changing in the locker room, only to return a few minutes later. <i>Id.</i> at 257. Upon his return, Nancy Blanchard (\"Blanchard\"), a rink employee, noted that Junta \"appeared angry.\" <i>Id.</i> Junta found Costin, and the two men immediately began throwing punches at one another. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>There was conflicting trial testimony as to which of the two men was the first aggressor. <i>Id.</i> Junta claimed that Costin attacked him first, while witnesses for the Commonwealth alleged that it was Junta who first grabbed Costin. <i>Id.</i> Costin, who weighed approximately 160 pounds, wound up on the ground with Junta, who weighed approximately 270 pounds, straddled on top of him. <i>Id.</i> Costin was punched numerous times in the face and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Also at issue at the trial was the number of blows Junta struck. Blanchard and other witnesses testified that Junta punched Costin \"many, many times,\" while Junta and his witnesses claimed that only \"two or three\" punches had been inflicted. <i>Id.</i> Blanchard and another witness asked Junta to stop, screaming, \"you're going to kill him.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Costin did not succumb immediately to Junta's blows. According to several witnesses, \"there was a period during that punching that [Costin] was moving, fighting, kicking, or flailing.\" <i>Id.</i> By the time that bystanders pulled Junta away from Costin, Costin was motionless. Emergency medical technicians and an advanced life support team treated Costin while en route to the hospital, but Costin died the next day.</p>\n<p>The number and nature of the blows inflicted were viewed as crucial. \"The law of [the Commonwealth of Massachusetts] recognizes unlawful-act manslaughter only if the unlawful act is a battery not amounting to a felony, when the defendant knew or should have known that the battery he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> was committing endangered human life.\" <i>Id.</i> (<i>quoting </i><i>Commonwealth v. Sires,</i> 413 Mass. 292, 596 N.E.2d 1018, 1024 n. 10 (1992)). As a result, if Junta inflicted only a single punch or minor blows, it would tend to negate his knowledge or imputed knowledge.</p>\n<p>The expert testimony at trial differed as to the number of blows. Dr. Stanton Kessler of the Commonwealth's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, the expert for the prosecution, had performed the autopsy. Dr. Kessler testified that, in addition to the numerous injuries on Costin's body, there were two areas of severe trauma: the base of the neck where the vertebral artery ruptured, cutting off twenty-five percent of the blood supply to the brain, and internal trauma to the left side of the head above the ear. <i>Junta,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 257. The latter injury, unrelated to the former, resulted in \"severe\" and \"serious\" bleeding of the brain. <i>Id.</i> The cause of death, in his opinion, was \"blunt head and neck trauma, contributory factor of bronchopneumonia [i.e., fluid in the lungs].\" <i>Id.</i> at 257-58. Although he acknowledged on several occasions that the injury to the vertebral artery could have been sustained by one blow, he testified that the tearing of the ligaments, \"almost tearing the head from the neck,\" indicated multiple blows. <i>Id.</i> at 258.</p>\n<p>Dr. Ira Kanfer, the defense expert, testified that the cause of death was rupture of the vertebral artery, a rare injury caused by minimal force, due to a single blow. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural History</h2>\n<p>On January 11, 2002, a Massachusetts Superior Court jury convicted Junta of involuntary manslaughter on the theory of unlawful killing by the commission of a battery. <i>Id.</i> at 256; <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 13. Junta was sentenced to serve six to ten years at the Massachusetts Correction Institution-Cedar Junction. <i>Junta,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 256.</p>\n<p>On February 10, 2003, Junta filed a motion for new trial. In support of his motion for a new trial, Junta submitted the affidavit of Melissa Christie (\"Christie\"), who worked at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. She alleged that she had attended an American Academy of Forensic Science (\"AAFS\") conference in Seattle, Washington, where Dr. Kessler had given a presentation on the technique for evaluating vertebral artery trauma at autopsy.<sup>[2]</sup> During his presentation, Dr. Kessler \"identified the case for the audience as being the famous `Hockey Dad's' case in Massachusetts,\" and showed slides of Costin's injuries. <i>Id.</i> at 258. He identified the rupture of the vertebral artery as the fatal injury and indicated that the injury can easily occur during a chiropractor visit. <i>Id.</i> According to Christie, \"[t]here was nothing in his talk about substantial force or multiple blows having caused the rupture of Mr. Costin's vertebral artery.\" <i>Id.</i> Following a non-evidentiary hearing, the trial judge denied Junta's motion. Junta filed a notice of appeal, and his two appealsthe first from his conviction and the second from the denial of his motion for new trialwere consolidated. On September <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> 23, 2004, the Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed Junta's conviction and denied his motion for new trial. <i>See id.</i> at 262. Junta subsequently filed with the Massachusetts Supreme Court an application for leave to obtain further appellate review, which the court denied.</p>\n<p>Having exhausted his state court remedies, on February 15, 2006, Junta filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. In his petition, Junta set forth a single claim based on the prosecution's alleged failure to disclose exculpatory evidence in violation of <i>Brady,</i> 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. Specifically, Junta alleged that the prosecution effectively suppressed the fact that Dr. Kessler had presented his findings in this case at an AAFS conference, and that the findings presented at the conference contradicted his trial testimony, thus depriving Junta of valuable impeachment evidence. The district court denied the petition. <i>Junta v. Thompson,</i> 647 F.Supp.2d 94, 102 (D.Mass.2009). Junta thereafter requested, and the district court granted, a certificate of appealability on the <i>Brady</i> issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's denial of habeas relief <i>de novo. </i><i>Aspen v. Bissonnette,</i> 480 F.3d 571, 573 (1st Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p>As a threshold matter, we must determine the proper standard of review with which to review the state court's disposition of Junta's appeal. Under AEDPA, \"the level of deference owed to a state court decision [on federal habeas review] hinges on whether the state court ever adjudicated the relevant claim on the merits or not.\" <i>Clements v. Clarke,</i> 592 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir.2010) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)). If the state court has adjudicated the claim on the merits, a federal habeas court must defer to the state court adjudication unless it:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p>28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). \"In contrast, a state court decision that does not address the federal claim on the merits falls beyond the ambit of AEDPA,\" <i>Clements,</i> 592 F.3d at 52, and the habeas court reviews such a claim <i>de novo. </i><i>Fortini v. Murphy,</i> 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts denied Junta's application for leave to obtain further appellate review, and thus, we \"look through to the last reasoned decision\" to determine the basis for the state court's holding. <i>Malone v. Clarke,</i> 536 F.3d 54, 63 n. 6 (1st Cir.2008) (internal quotations omitted). As a result, we turn to the decision of the Massachusetts Appeals Court.</p>\n<p>As to both Dr. Kessler's presentation and the abstract of his presentation, Junta contends that we must review his <i>Brady</i> claims <i>de novo.</i> With respect to the presentation, Junta contends that the Massachusetts Appeals Court did not address whether the alleged suppression of Dr. Kessler's presentation violated <i>Brady.</i> As to the abstract, Junta alleges that the Massachusetts Appeals Court did not examine whether the prosecution effectively suppressed Dr. Kessler's abstract by disclosing it to defense counsel on the last page of Dr. Kessler's updated C.V. on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> morning of his testimony, thereby ignoring the second prong of the <i>Brady</i> analysis. We disagree.</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Appeals Court addressed Junta's claim explaining that due process is violated under <i>Brady</i> \"if the prosecution fails to produce `evidence which provides some significant aid to the defendant's case, whether it furnishes corroboration of the defendant's story, calls into question a material, although not indispensable, element of the prosecution's version of the events, or challenges the credibility of a key prosecution witness.'\" <i>Junta,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 259. The Massachusetts Appeals Court then addressed the <i>Brady</i> issue, stating:</p>\n<blockquote>After examining Dr. Kessler's testimony and the abstract, we conclude, as did the motion judge (who was also the trial judge), that the defendant has not met his burden. The abstract is not inconsistent with Dr. Kessler's testimony, and, moreover, the defendant overstates the factual importance of the experts' testimony in this case. Although the defendant urges that Dr. Kessler testified that multiple blows caused the rupture of the vertebral artery, he did not so testify. What led him to the conclusion of multiple blows was the fact that there were also other injuries including \"the injury in the middle of the brain.\" He stated, \"Taking into account the tearing of the small vessels in the cavity of the brain we call the ventricle. Taking into account the amount of blood and tearing of the vertebral injury and the bruising and hemorrhage in the vertebral arteries on both sides. And the hemorrhage in the neck. This is a substantial force injury. It takes a lot of trauma to tear ligaments and the ligaments at the back of the skull are torn and hemorrhaged.\" That the abstract reported that tearing of the vertebral artery may typically be caused by minor blows in no way contradicts Dr. Kessler's testimony that due to the severity of the injuries in this case, multiple blows were here inflicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Perhaps even more important, the testimony of the percipient witnesses belied the claim of one or minimal blows. No witness testified that the defendant hit Costin only once, and the defendant himself testified that there were two or three punches. Both experts pointed out that once the vertebral artery is ruptured, the victim would within seconds become unconscious or brain dead. As the trial judge pointed out in his well-reasoned memorandum denying a new trial,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"there was substantial eye testimony that the victim was still moving after a minimum of two punches. There was also substantial testimony from eyewitnesses that [the defendant] punched the victim anywhere from three up to ten or more times. Therefore, the information contained in Dr. Kessler's [a]bstract would not have provided [the defendant] with effective impeachment material.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 259-60 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>A matter is \"adjudicated on the merits\" if there is a \"decision finally resolving the parties' claims, with res judicata effect, that is based on the substance of the claim advanced, rather than on a procedural, or other, ground.\" <i>Teti,</i> 507 F.3d at 56 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Here, the Massachusetts Appeals Court's treatment of Junta's <i>Brady</i> claim constituted a final decision with res judicata effect. Additionally, the court relied on substantive grounds in reaching its decision. \"Thus, this was neither a disposition on procedural grounds nor a summary disposition in which the court simply remained silent on the issue.\" <i>Clements,</i> 592 F.3d at 53.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> Moreover, we have previously stated that</p>\n<blockquote>AEDPA's trigger for deferential review is adjudication, not explanation. When a state court has truly avoided (or merely overlooked) the petitioner's federal claim, a federal court may step into the breach and review de novo. But judicial opacity is a far cry from judicial avoidance. It is the result to which we owe deference, not the opinion expounding it.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 55-56 (internal citation omitted). Thus, the question before us is not whether the state court opinion engaged in the comprehensive analysis typically required of \"a law school examination,\" <i>Rashad v. Walsh,</i> 300 F.3d 27, 45 (1st Cir.2002), but whether the substance of Junta's federal claims was addressed. Because we find that the Massachusetts Appeals Court addressed the effective suppression of Dr. Kessler's C.V.,<sup>[3]</sup> and the suppression of both the abstract and the substance of Dr. Kessler's presentation, through the lens of <i>Brady, see </i><i>Junta,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 259-60, we review the state court's decision under AEDPA's deferential standard of review.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The <i>Brady</i> Claim</h2>\n<p>We now turn to the merits of Junta's claim. Junta contends that the prosecution effectively suppressed exculpatory evidence in violation of his due process rights. Specifically, he maintains that Dr. Kessler's abstract and presentation, viewed together, provided valuable impeachment evidence because they contradicted Dr. Kessler's testimony at trial.</p>\n<p>Junta does not contend that the state court's rejection of his <i>Brady</i> claim was \"contrary to\" clearly established Supreme Court precedent, and thus we limit our inquiry to whether the state court's decision was an \"unreasonable application of\" such precedent. \"A state court decision is an unreasonable application of the governing law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the Supreme Court's then-current decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> <i>Aspen,</i> 480 F.3d at 574. The Supreme Court has emphasized that \"an <i>unreasonable</i> application of federal law is different from an <i>incorrect</i> application of federal law.\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 410, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (emphasis in original). Thus, \"[a] decision can still be reasonable even if the reviewing court thinks it is wrong; `unreasonable' here means something more than incorrect or erroneous.\" <i>Teti,</i> 507 F.3d at 57 (citation omitted). If there is \"a close question [as to] whether the state decision is in error, then the state decision cannot be an unreasonable application.\" <i>Healy v. Spencer,</i> 453 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The clearly established law governing the mandatory disclosure of exculpatory evidence is set forth in <i>Brady,</i> 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. The Supreme Court has identified a three-part test for adjudicating <i>Brady</i> claims: (1) \"[t]he evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching;\" (2) \"that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently;\" and (3) \"prejudice must have ensued.\" <i>Strickler v. Greene,</i> 527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999).</p>\n<p>At the outset, we note that there is a dispute as to whether the <i>Brady</i> obligation extends to prosecution experts, such as a medical examiner.<sup>[5]</sup> Assuming arguendo that <i>Brady</i> applies, there is nothing to suggest that the Massachusetts Appeals Court unreasonably applied <i>Brady.</i></p>\n<p>It was not unreasonable for the Massachusetts Appeals Court to conclude that Dr. Kessler's C.V., the abstract, and the substance of Dr. Kessler's presentation were not favorable to Junta, given that they were not inconsistent with Dr. Kessler's testimony. At trial, Dr. Kessler conceded on several occasions that Costin's fatal injury, rupture of the vertebral artery, could have been caused by minimal force or a single blow. Furthermore, Dr. Kessler's opinion that Junta used substantial force was based on all the injuries Costin incurred, not merely on the vertebral artery rupture. Likewise, Dr. Kessler's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> opinion that Junta inflicted multiple blows was not based on the rupture of the vertebral artery, but on the fact that Dr. Kessler found fifteen areas of trauma throughout Costin's body.</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Appeals Court reasonably concluded that the materials would not have undermined Dr. Kessler's opinion that Junta had used substantial force and inflicted multiple blows. But more importantly, as the Massachusetts Appeals Court noted, Junta \"overstates the factual importance of the experts' testimony in this case.\" <i>Junta,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 259. Junta, outweighing Costin by more than one hundred pounds, straddled Costin and \"punched [him] anywhere from three up to ten or more times,\" even after two witnesses had screamed at Junta to stop because he was \"going to kill [Costin]\" and the latter remained motionless. <i>Id.</i> at 257, 260. Given these circumstances, putting aside Dr. Kessler's testimony, there was substantial evidence for the jury to conclude that Junta knew or should have known that the battery he was committing endangered Costin's life. The materials do not call this conclusion into question. Thus, it was not unreasonable for the Massachusetts Appeals Court to conclude that these materials did not provide effective impeachment or exculpatory evidence.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, we cannot say that the Massachusetts Appeals Court's treatment of the <i>Brady</i> issue was unreasonable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In habeas cases, \"a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1). This presumption of correctness applies to findings of facts made by state trial and appellate courts. <i>Teti v. Bender,</i> 507 F.3d 50, 58-59 (1st Cir.2007). As a result, \"[w]e describe the facts as they appear from the state court record.\" <i>Id.</i> at 53.</p>\n<p>[2]  In the abstract of the presentation, <i>Through the Tight Canal SwiftlyA Review of the Technique for Evaluating Vertebral Artery Trauma Autopsy,</i> Dr. Kessler and his co-author wrote:\n</p>\n<p>To make this diagnosis [of traumatic basilar subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary to vertebral artery injuries] there must not be any other traumatic injury to the brain, dural coverings, spinal cord, or skull. Typical terminal events usually relate to a fight in which the victim has received only minor blows to the head from an assailant. The victim may then be witnessed to collapse, develop seizures and either die immediately or linger brain dead in a surgical intensive care unit....</p>\n<p>[3]  In addressing Junta's claim that the Government effectively suppressed the updated copy of Dr. Kessler's C.V. by providing a copy of the C.V. at trial, the Massachusetts Appeals Court explained that the prosecution \"in fact provided defense counsel with an updated copy of Dr. Kessler's curriculum vitae on the morning of his testimony\" [but that] [t]here were \"conflicting affidavits as to whether the prosecution had pointed out to the defense the addition of the abstract to the curriculum vitae.\" <i>Junta,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 259 n. 6. The Massachusetts Appeals Court, however, did not decide whether the untimely disclosure of the C.V. amounted to an effective suppression of the C.V. Instead, the Massachusetts Appeals Court adopted the motion judge's reasoning that \"even assuming all of the facts alleged by [Junta] are true, [he] has failed to show that the Commonwealth's nondisclosure of Dr. Kessler's abstract caused him prejudice.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[4]  We note that the district court reviewed Junta's <i>Brady</i> claim regarding the suppression of Dr. Kessler's presentation <i>de novo. See </i><i>Junta,</i> 647 F.Supp.2d 94 at 99. The district court explained that although the Massachusetts Appeals Court examined the evidence regarding the presentation, it declined to issue separate findings on materiality. A review of the Massachusetts Appeals Court decision reveals, however, that the court addressed the substance of the presentation in light of Junta's <i>Brady</i> claim, but declined to issue additional findings given that the presentation had not been recorded. <i>Junta,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 259 n. 4. Because we find that the Massachusetts Appeals Court addressed Junta's claim regarding Dr. Kessler's presentation in light of <i>Brady,</i> we decline to follow the district court's decision to review this aspect of the Massachusetts Appeals Court decision <i>de novo.</i> Moreover, we note that the district court rejected Junta's claim under <i>de novo</i> review, finding that no <i>Brady</i> violation had occurred. <i>Junta,</i> 647 F.Supp.2d 94 at 102.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Supreme Court has previously stated that the phrase \"clearly established as determined by [the Supreme] Court refers to holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of [the Supreme] Court's decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\" <i>Yarborough v. Alvarado,</i> 541 U.S. 652, 660-61, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In <i>Kyles v. Whitley,</i> the Supreme Court held that the prosecution's <i>Brady</i> obligation extends even to \"evidence known only to police investigators and not to the prosecutor.\" 514 U.S. 419, 438, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). The Court noted that \"the individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government's behalf in the case, including the police.\" <i>Id.</i> at 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555. Junta relies, in part, on <i>Commonwealth v. Woodward,</i> 427 Mass. 659, 694 N.E.2d 1277, 1292 (1998), for the proposition that a medical examiner is a government \"agent,\" but this case obviously does not present \"clearly established Federal law.\" The government, on the other hand, argues that, in addition to there not being guidance from the Court as to who may be considered to be \"acting on the government's behalf,\" courts are divided as to whether evidence in the possession of a medical examiner may be attributed to the prosecution for <i>Brady</i> purposes. <i>Compare </i><i>People v. Stern,</i> 270 A.D.2d 118, 704 N.Y.S.2d 569, 570 (2000) (holding that documents in the possession of a medical examiner cannot be attributed to the prosecution because the Office of Medical Examiners is \"not a law enforcement agency\"), <i>with </i><i>Woodward,</i> 694 N.E.2d at 1292 (holding that a medical examiner was \"a Commonwealth agent\" for purposes of a failure to preserve evidence claim). Because we assume, arguendo, that a medical examiner falls within the <i>Brady</i> purview and address the merits of Junta's <i>Brady</i> claim, we need not resolve this issue.</p>\n<p>[6]  Given that the materials are not favorable to Junta, we need not decide whether the prosecution \"effectively\" disclosed the abstract by providing a copy of the C.V. at trial.</p>\n\n</div>",

No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214. We find it did not and thus affirm the denial of habeas corpus relief by the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Facts<sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p>On the afternoon of July 5, 2000, Junta took his ten-year old son and two friends to the Burbank Ice Arena in Reading, Massachusetts for \"stick practice,\" an informal hockey practice. <i>Commonwealth v. Junta,</i> 62 Mass.App.Ct. 120, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></span>, 256 (2004). During the practice, Junta watched from the stands. Junta, after watching the game for a period of time, believed the game had become too rough and went down to ice-level to complain to Michael Costin (\"Costin\"), an adult who was participating in the practice with his three sons. <i>Id.</i> Costin responded, \"That's hockey.\" <i>Id.</i> The men exchanged words, but no physical altercation took place at that time.</p>\n<p>The practice ended shortly thereafter, and the players returned to the locker room. While the players were changing out of their hockey gear, Junta and Costin again confronted one another, first verbally and then physically. Other nearby adults broke up the fight. Junta departed the arena, leaving his son to finish changing in the locker room, only to return a few minutes later. <i>Id.</i> at 257. Upon his return, Nancy Blanchard (\"Blanchard\"), a rink employee, noted that Junta \"appeared angry.\" <i>Id.</i> Junta found Costin, and the two men immediately began throwing punches at one another. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>There was conflicting trial testimony as to which of the two men was the first aggressor. <i>Id.</i> Junta claimed that Costin attacked him first, while witnesses for the Commonwealth alleged that it was Junta who first grabbed Costin. <i>Id.</i> Costin, who weighed approximately 160 pounds, wound up on the ground with Junta, who weighed approximately 270 pounds, straddled on top of him. <i>Id.</i> Costin was punched numerous times in the face and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Also at issue at the trial was the number of blows Junta struck. Blanchard and other witnesses testified that Junta punched Costin \"many, many times,\" while Junta and his witnesses claimed that only \"two or three\" punches had been inflicted. <i>Id.</i> Blanchard and another witness asked Junta to stop, screaming, \"you're going to kill him.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Costin did not succumb immediately to Junta's blows. According to several witnesses, \"there was a period during that punching that [Costin] was moving, fighting, kicking, or flailing.\" <i>Id.</i> By the time that bystanders pulled Junta away from Costin, Costin was motionless. Emergency medical technicians and an advanced life support team treated Costin while en route to the hospital, but Costin died the next day.</p>\n<p>The number and nature of the blows inflicted were viewed as crucial. \"The law of [the Commonwealth of Massachusetts] recognizes unlawful-act manslaughter only if the unlawful act is a battery not amounting to a felony, when the defendant knew or should have known that the battery he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> was committing endangered human life.\" <i>Id.</i> (<i>quoting </i><i>Commonwealth v. Sires,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2218611\"><a href=\"/opinion/2218611/commonwealth-v-sires/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2218611\"><a href=\"/opinion/2218611/commonwealth-v-sires/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>, 1024 n. 10 (1992)). As a result, if Junta inflicted only a single punch or minor blows, it would tend to negate his knowledge or imputed knowledge.</p>\n<p>The expert testimony at trial differed as to the number of blows. Dr. Stanton Kessler of the Commonwealth's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, the expert for the prosecution, had performed the autopsy. Dr. Kessler testified that, in addition to the numerous injuries on Costin's body, there were two areas of severe trauma: the base of the neck where the vertebral artery ruptured, cutting off twenty-five percent of the blood supply to the brain, and internal trauma to the left side of the head above the ear. <i>Junta,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 257. The latter injury, unrelated to the former, resulted in \"severe\" and \"serious\" bleeding of the brain. <i>Id.</i> The cause of death, in his opinion, was \"blunt head and neck trauma, contributory factor of bronchopneumonia [i.e., fluid in the lungs].\" <i>Id.</i> at 257-58. Although he acknowledged on several occasions that the injury to the vertebral artery could have been sustained by one blow, he testified that the tearing of the ligaments, \"almost tearing the head from the neck,\" indicated multiple blows. <i>Id.</i> at 258.</p>\n<p>Dr. Ira Kanfer, the defense expert, testified that the cause of death was rupture of the vertebral artery, a rare injury caused by minimal force, due to a single blow. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural History</h2>\n<p>On January 11, 2002, a Massachusetts Superior Court jury convicted Junta of involuntary manslaughter on the theory of unlawful killing by the commission of a battery. <i>Id.</i> at 256; <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 13. Junta was sentenced to serve six to ten years at the Massachusetts Correction Institution-Cedar Junction. <i>Junta,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 256.</p>\n<p>On February 10, 2003, Junta filed a motion for new trial. In support of his motion for a new trial, Junta submitted the affidavit of Melissa Christie (\"Christie\"), who worked at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. She alleged that she had attended an American Academy of Forensic Science (\"AAFS\") conference in Seattle, Washington, where Dr. Kessler had given a presentation on the technique for evaluating vertebral artery trauma at autopsy.<sup>[2]</sup> During his presentation, Dr. Kessler \"identified the case for the audience as being the famous `Hockey Dad's' case in Massachusetts,\" and showed slides of Costin's injuries. <i>Id.</i> at 258. He identified the rupture of the vertebral artery as the fatal injury and indicated that the injury can easily occur during a chiropractor visit. <i>Id.</i> According to Christie, \"[t]here was nothing in his talk about substantial force or multiple blows having caused the rupture of Mr. Costin's vertebral artery.\" <i>Id.</i> Following a non-evidentiary hearing, the trial judge denied Junta's motion. Junta filed a notice of appeal, and his two appealsthe first from his conviction and the second from the denial of his motion for new trialwere consolidated. On September <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> 23, 2004, the Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed Junta's conviction and denied his motion for new trial. <i>See id.</i> at 262. Junta subsequently filed with the Massachusetts Supreme Court an application for leave to obtain further appellate review, which the court denied.</p>\n<p>Having exhausted his state court remedies, on February 15, 2006, Junta filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. In his petition, Junta set forth a single claim based on the prosecution's alleged failure to disclose exculpatory evidence in violation of <i>Brady,</i> 373 U.S. at 87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>. Specifically, Junta alleged that the prosecution effectively suppressed the fact that Dr. Kessler had presented his findings in this case at an AAFS conference, and that the findings presented at the conference contradicted his trial testimony, thus depriving Junta of valuable impeachment evidence. The district court denied the petition. <i>Junta v. Thompson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2401969\"><a href=\"/opinion/2401969/junta-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 102 (D.Mass.2009). Junta thereafter requested, and the district court granted, a certificate of appealability on the <i>Brady</i> issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's denial of habeas relief <i>de novo. </i><i>Aspen v. Bissonnette,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202666\"><a href=\"/opinion/202666/aspen-v-bissonette/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 573 (1st Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p>As a threshold matter, we must determine the proper standard of review with which to review the state court's disposition of Junta's appeal. Under AEDPA, \"the level of deference owed to a state court decision [on federal habeas review] hinges on whether the state court ever adjudicated the relevant claim on the merits or not.\" <i>Clements v. Clarke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204181\"><a href=\"/opinion/204181/clements-v-clarke/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2010) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)). If the state court has adjudicated the claim on the merits, a federal habeas court must defer to the state court adjudication unless it:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p>28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). \"In contrast, a state court decision that does not address the federal claim on the merits falls beyond the ambit of AEDPA,\" <i>Clements,</i> 592 F.3d at 52, and the habeas court reviews such a claim <i>de novo. </i><i>Fortini v. Murphy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199512\"><a href=\"/opinion/199512/fortini-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts denied Junta's application for leave to obtain further appellate review, and thus, we \"look through to the last reasoned decision\" to determine the basis for the state court's holding. <i>Malone v. Clarke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203416\"><a href=\"/opinion/203416/malone-v-clarke/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 63 n. 6 (1st Cir.2008) (internal quotations omitted). As a result, we turn to the decision of the Massachusetts Appeals Court.</p>\n<p>As to both Dr. Kessler's presentation and the abstract of his presentation, Junta contends that we must review his <i>Brady</i> claims <i>de novo.</i> With respect to the presentation, Junta contends that the Massachusetts Appeals Court did not address whether the alleged suppression of Dr. Kessler's presentation violated <i>Brady.</i> As to the abstract, Junta alleges that the Massachusetts Appeals Court did not examine whether the prosecution effectively suppressed Dr. Kessler's abstract by disclosing it to defense counsel on the last page of Dr. Kessler's updated C.V. on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> morning of his testimony, thereby ignoring the second prong of the <i>Brady</i> analysis. We disagree.</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Appeals Court addressed Junta's claim explaining that due process is violated under <i>Brady</i> \"if the prosecution fails to produce `evidence which provides some significant aid to the defendant's case, whether it furnishes corroboration of the defendant's story, calls into question a material, although not indispensable, element of the prosecution's version of the events, or challenges the credibility of a key prosecution witness.'\" <i>Junta,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 259. The Massachusetts Appeals Court then addressed the <i>Brady</i> issue, stating:</p>\n<blockquote>After examining Dr. Kessler's testimony and the abstract, we conclude, as did the motion judge (who was also the trial judge), that the defendant has not met his burden. The abstract is not inconsistent with Dr. Kessler's testimony, and, moreover, the defendant overstates the factual importance of the experts' testimony in this case. Although the defendant urges that Dr. Kessler testified that multiple blows caused the rupture of the vertebral artery, he did not so testify. What led him to the conclusion of multiple blows was the fact that there were also other injuries including \"the injury in the middle of the brain.\" He stated, \"Taking into account the tearing of the small vessels in the cavity of the brain we call the ventricle. Taking into account the amount of blood and tearing of the vertebral injury and the bruising and hemorrhage in the vertebral arteries on both sides. And the hemorrhage in the neck. This is a substantial force injury. It takes a lot of trauma to tear ligaments and the ligaments at the back of the skull are torn and hemorrhaged.\" That the abstract reported that tearing of the vertebral artery may typically be caused by minor blows in no way contradicts Dr. Kessler's testimony that due to the severity of the injuries in this case, multiple blows were here inflicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Perhaps even more important, the testimony of the percipient witnesses belied the claim of one or minimal blows. No witness testified that the defendant hit Costin only once, and the defendant himself testified that there were two or three punches. Both experts pointed out that once the vertebral artery is ruptured, the victim would within seconds become unconscious or brain dead. As the trial judge pointed out in his well-reasoned memorandum denying a new trial,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"there was substantial eye testimony that the victim was still moving after a minimum of two punches. There was also substantial testimony from eyewitnesses that [the defendant] punched the victim anywhere from three up to ten or more times. Therefore, the information contained in Dr. Kessler's [a]bstract would not have provided [the defendant] with effective impeachment material.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 259-60 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>A matter is \"adjudicated on the merits\" if there is a \"decision finally resolving the parties' claims, with res judicata effect, that is based on the substance of the claim advanced, rather than on a procedural, or other, ground.\" <i>Teti,</i> 507 F.3d at 56 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Here, the Massachusetts Appeals Court's treatment of Junta's <i>Brady</i> claim constituted a final decision with res judicata effect. Additionally, the court relied on substantive grounds in reaching its decision. \"Thus, this was neither a disposition on procedural grounds nor a summary disposition in which the court simply remained silent on the issue.\" <i>Clements,</i> 592 F.3d at 53.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> Moreover, we have previously stated that</p>\n<blockquote>AEDPA's trigger for deferential review is adjudication, not explanation. When a state court has truly avoided (or merely overlooked) the petitioner's federal claim, a federal court may step into the breach and review de novo. But judicial opacity is a far cry from judicial avoidance. It is the result to which we owe deference, not the opinion expounding it.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 55-56 (internal citation omitted). Thus, the question before us is not whether the state court opinion engaged in the comprehensive analysis typically required of \"a law school examination,\" <i>Rashad v. Walsh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200079\"><a href=\"/opinion/200079/rashad-v-walsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2002), but whether the substance of Junta's federal claims was addressed. Because we find that the Massachusetts Appeals Court addressed the effective suppression of Dr. Kessler's C.V.,<sup>[3]</sup> and the suppression of both the abstract and the substance of Dr. Kessler's presentation, through the lens of <i>Brady, see </i><i>Junta,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 259-60, we review the state court's decision under AEDPA's deferential standard of review.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The <i>Brady</i> Claim</h2>\n<p>We now turn to the merits of Junta's claim. Junta contends that the prosecution effectively suppressed exculpatory evidence in violation of his due process rights. Specifically, he maintains that Dr. Kessler's abstract and presentation, viewed together, provided valuable impeachment evidence because they contradicted Dr. Kessler's testimony at trial.</p>\n<p>Junta does not contend that the state court's rejection of his <i>Brady</i> claim was \"contrary to\" clearly established Supreme Court precedent, and thus we limit our inquiry to whether the state court's decision was an \"unreasonable application of\" such precedent. \"A state court decision is an unreasonable application of the governing law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the Supreme Court's then-current decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> <i>Aspen,</i> 480 F.3d at 574.

Thus, \"[a] decision can still be reasonable even if the reviewing court thinks it is wrong; `unreasonable' here means something more than incorrect or erroneous.\" <i>Teti,</i> 507 F.3d at 57 (citation omitted). If there is \"a close question [as to] whether the state decision is in error, then the state decision cannot be an unreasonable application.\" <i>Healy v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>. The Supreme Court has identified a three-part test for adjudicating <i>Brady</i> claims: (1) \"[t]he evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching;\" (2) \"that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently;\" and (3) \"prejudice must have ensued.\" <i>Strickler v. Greene,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, 281-82, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span> (1999).</p>\n<p>At the outset, we note that there is a dispute as to whether the <i>Brady</i> obligation extends to prosecution experts, such as a medical examiner.<sup>[5]</sup> Assuming arguendo that <i>Brady</i> applies, there is nothing to suggest that the Massachusetts Appeals Court unreasonably applied <i>Brady.</i></p>\n<p>It was not unreasonable for the Massachusetts Appeals Court to conclude that Dr. Kessler's C.V., the abstract, and the substance of Dr. Kessler's presentation were not favorable to Junta, given that they were not inconsistent with Dr. Kessler's testimony. At trial, Dr. Kessler conceded on several occasions that Costin's fatal injury, rupture of the vertebral artery, could have been caused by minimal force or a single blow. Furthermore, Dr. Kessler's opinion that Junta used substantial force was based on all the injuries Costin incurred, not merely on the vertebral artery rupture. Likewise, Dr. Kessler's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> opinion that Junta inflicted multiple blows was not based on the rupture of the vertebral artery, but on the fact that Dr. Kessler found fifteen areas of trauma throughout Costin's body.</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Appeals Court reasonably concluded that the materials would not have undermined Dr. Kessler's opinion that Junta had used substantial force and inflicted multiple blows. But more importantly, as the Massachusetts Appeals Court noted, Junta \"overstates the factual importance of the experts' testimony in this case.\" <i>Junta,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 259. Junta, outweighing Costin by more than one hundred pounds, straddled Costin and \"punched [him] anywhere from three up to ten or more times,\" even after two witnesses had screamed at Junta to stop because he was \"going to kill [Costin]\" and the latter remained motionless. <i>Id.</i> at 257, 260. Given these circumstances, putting aside Dr. Kessler's testimony, there was substantial evidence for the jury to conclude that Junta knew or should have known that the battery he was committing endangered Costin's life. The materials do not call this conclusion into question. Thus, it was not unreasonable for the Massachusetts Appeals Court to conclude that these materials did not provide effective impeachment or exculpatory evidence.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, we cannot say that the Massachusetts Appeals Court's treatment of the <i>Brady</i> issue was unreasonable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In habeas cases, \"a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1). This presumption of correctness applies to findings of facts made by state trial and appellate courts. <i>Teti v. Bender,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203020\"><a href=\"/opinion/203020/teti-v-bender/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 58-59 (1st Cir.2007). As a result, \"[w]e describe the facts as they appear from the state court record.\" <i>Id.</i> at 53.</p>\n<p>[2]  In the abstract of the presentation, <i>Through the Tight Canal SwiftlyA Review of the Technique for Evaluating Vertebral Artery Trauma Autopsy,</i> Dr. Kessler and his co-author wrote:\n</p>\n<p>To make this diagnosis [of traumatic basilar subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary to vertebral artery injuries] there must not be any other traumatic injury to the brain, dural coverings, spinal cord, or skull. Typical terminal events usually relate to a fight in which the victim has received only minor blows to the head from an assailant. The victim may then be witnessed to collapse, develop seizures and either die immediately or linger brain dead in a surgical intensive care unit....</p>\n<p>[3]  In addressing Junta's claim that the Government effectively suppressed the updated copy of Dr. Kessler's C.V. by providing a copy of the C.V. at trial, the Massachusetts Appeals Court explained that the prosecution \"in fact provided defense counsel with an updated copy of Dr. Kessler's curriculum vitae on the morning of his testimony\" [but that] [t]here were \"conflicting affidavits as to whether the prosecution had pointed out to the defense the addition of the abstract to the curriculum vitae.\" <i>Junta,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 259 n. 6. The Massachusetts Appeals Court, however, did not decide whether the untimely disclosure of the C.V. amounted to an effective suppression of the C.V. Instead, the Massachusetts Appeals Court adopted the motion judge's reasoning that \"even assuming all of the facts alleged by [Junta] are true, [he] has failed to show that the Commonwealth's nondisclosure of Dr. Kessler's abstract caused him prejudice.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[4]  We note that the district court reviewed Junta's <i>Brady</i> claim regarding the suppression of Dr. Kessler's presentation <i>de novo. See </i><i>Junta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2401969\"><a href=\"/opinion/2401969/junta-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span> at 99. The district court explained that although the Massachusetts Appeals Court examined the evidence regarding the presentation, it declined to issue separate findings on materiality. A review of the Massachusetts Appeals Court decision reveals, however, that the court addressed the substance of the presentation in light of Junta's <i>Brady</i> claim, but declined to issue additional findings given that the presentation had not been recorded. <i>Junta,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 259 n. 4. Because we find that the Massachusetts Appeals Court addressed Junta's claim regarding Dr. Kessler's presentation in light of <i>Brady,</i> we decline to follow the district court's decision to review this aspect of the Massachusetts Appeals Court decision <i>de novo.</i> Moreover, we note that the district court rejected Junta's claim under <i>de novo</i> review, finding that no <i>Brady</i> violation had occurred. <i>Junta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2401969\"><a href=\"/opinion/2401969/junta-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span> at 102.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Supreme Court has previously stated that the phrase \"clearly established as determined by [the Supreme] Court refers to holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of [the Supreme] Court's decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\" <i>Yarborough v. Alvarado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134748\"><a href=\"/opinion/134748/yarborough-v-alvarado/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span>, 660-61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134748\"><a href=\"/opinion/134748/yarborough-v-alvarado/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court noted that \"the individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government's behalf in the case, including the police.\" <i>Id.</i> at 437, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Woodward,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1277</span></span>, 1292 (1998), for the proposition that a medical examiner is a government \"agent,\" but this case obviously does not present \"clearly established Federal law.\" The government, on the other hand, argues that, in addition to there not being guidance from the Court as to who may be considered to be \"acting on the government's behalf,\" courts are divided as to whether evidence in the possession of a medical examiner may be attributed to the prosecution for <i>Brady</i> purposes. <i>Compare </i><i>People v. Stern,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.D.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></span>, 570 (2000) (holding that documents in the possession of a medical examiner cannot be attributed to the prosecution because the Office of Medical Examiners is \"not a law enforcement agency\"), <i>with </i><i>Woodward,</i> 694 N.E.2d at 1292 (holding that a medical examiner was \"a Commonwealth agent\" for purposes of a failure to preserve evidence claim). Because we assume, arguendo, that a medical examiner falls within the <i>Brady</i> purview and address the merits of Junta's <i>Brady</i> claim, we need not resolve this issue.</p>\n<p>[6]  Given that the materials are not favorable to Junta, we need not decide whether the prosecution \"effectively\" disclosed the abstract by providing a copy of the C.V. at trial.</p>\n\n</div>",
