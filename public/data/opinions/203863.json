William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                Torruella, Baldock,* and Howard,\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Kenneth I. Seiger, for appellant.\n     Scott A. Katz, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau,\nwith whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 10, 2009\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. On the morning of November 17,\n\n2000,   Annmarie     Kotowski    (\"Mrs.     Kotowski\")      was    found   in   her\n\napartment severely beaten and covered in blood.                She survived, but\n\ncould not remember the details surrounding the attack or the person\n\nwho attacked her.         After an investigation, police identified\n\nPetitioner-Appellant Michael O'Laughlin as the perpetrator.\n\n           A    Massachusetts      Superior        Court    jury     subsequently\n\nconvicted O'Laughlin of the following counts: (1) burglary and\n\narmed assault in a dwelling; (2) armed assault in a dwelling; (3)\n\narmed assault with intent to murder; and (4) assault and battery by\n\nmeans of a dangerous weapon.          The Superior Court then sentenced\n\nO'Laughlin to 35-50 years on Counts One and Two; 19-20 years on\n\nCount 3; and 9-10 years on Count 4, ruling that the sentences were\n\nto be served concurrently.        The intermediate Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt reversed the judgments holding that there was insufficient\n\nevidence to support the verdicts.           Commonwealth v. O'Laughlin, 830\n\nN.E.2d 222 (Mass. App. Ct. 2005) (hereinafter \"O'Laughlin I\"). The\n\nMassachusetts      Supreme     Judicial    Court     (\"SJC\")      reinstated    the\n\njudgment reasoning that there was sufficient evidence to support\n\nthe verdicts.       Commonwealth v. O'Laughlin, 843 N.E.2d 617 (Mass.\n\n2006) (hereinafter \"O'Laughlin II\").\n\n           O'Laughlin filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nin   the   United     States    District     Court    for    the    District     of\n\nMassachusetts on grounds that (1) the SJC's ruling was objectively\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\funreasonable because there was insufficient evidence to support a\n\nguilty verdict and (2) that the SJC violated his constitutional\n\nright to present a defense. The district court denied O'Laughlin's\n\npetition for habeas relief.        After careful consideration, we\n\nreverse the judgment of the district court and order the district\n\ncourt to grant the petition.\n\n                          I.     Background\n\n          A.   Factual Summary\n\n          \"We must 'accept the state court findings of fact unless\n\n[O'Laughlin] convinces us, by clear and convincing evidence, that\n\nthey are in error.'\"   Lynch v. Ficco, 438 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (quoting McCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d 24, 26 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(en banc)); see also 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).      We note that the\n\nSJC's findings of fact may be \"supplemented with other facts from\n\nthe record that are consistent with the SJC's findings.\"    Lynch,\n\n438 F.3d at 39; see also Healy v. Spencer, 453 F.3d 21, 22 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).    Thus, we recount the facts largely as they were\n\npresented in the SJC's opinion.\n\n          In May 2000, Mrs. Kotowski revealed to David Kotowski\n\n(\"Mr. Kotowski\"), her husband of over twenty-five years, that she\n\nwas romantically involved with James Finn. In September 2000, Mrs.\n\nKotowski moved out of her home into the Fox Hollow condominium\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fcomplex in a neighboring town.1        She resided alone.         O'Laughlin, a\n\nmember of Fox Hollow's maintenance staff, lived two doors down from\n\nMrs. Kotowski.     Like other members of the maintenance staff, he\n\npossessed a master key to all the buildings on the property,\n\nincluding a key to Mrs. Kotowski's apartment.2\n\n           The SJC noted that O'Laughlin \"took some interest\" in\n\nMrs.   Kotowski   prior   to    the   attack.    For     example,    when    Mrs.\n\nKotowski's   sister   was      visiting,    O'Laughlin    stood    outside   her\n\napartment and asked Mrs. Kotowski if there were \"any more good\n\nlooking women in there[.]\" Also, he referred to Mrs. Kotowski five\n\nor six times in conversations with acquaintances, citing her\n\n\"beautiful antique furniture\" in her apartment as evidence of her\n\nwealth and remarking that he was attracted to her \"body type.\"3\n\n           The day before the attack, O'Laughlin cashed a $457.16\n\npaycheck and made $200 child support payment to his ex-wife. Also,\n\nthe SJC stated that O'Laughlin was agitated when he was unable to\n\n\n1\n   The SJC indicated a \"difficult\" marital situation: \"Both the\nvictim and her husband characterized their relationship as friendly\nbut strained. (Other witnesses described the husband's attitude as\nalternating between loving and angry.)\"       Approximately a week\nbefore the attack, she conversed for the first time with her\nhusband about the possibility of getting a divorce. Mrs. Kotowski\ntestified that Mr. Kotowski was \"crushed\" by the move.\n2\n   O'Laughlin had been inside Mrs. Kotowski's apartment at least\nonce previously in September to fix a window, among other tasks.\n3\n   In addition, the SJC states that just days before the attack,\none acquaintance testified that O'Laughlin had \"really scared\" Mrs.\nKotowski by inquiring \"about the window in her apartment.\"\nHowever, once Mrs. Kotowski realized he was on the maintenance\nstaff, she simply walked away.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fsell his trailer to his neighbor because the neighbor could not\n\ncome up with $500.    The neighbor paid him the next day.\n\n          On the night of the attack, the SJC described O'Laughlin\n\nas \"[n]ervous, jittery, [and] paranoid . . . .\"    This was \"typical\n\nbehavior when he smoked crack cocaine,\" which O'Laughlin had done\n\nearlier that evening at the home of a friend, Mark Puleri.\n\n          As the night wore on, O'Laughlin was \"depleted of drugs\n\nand most of his cash.\"       At 9:00 or 9:30 p.m. that evening,\n\nO'Laughlin, now at home alone, telephoned another friend, Grover\n\nFinkle, asking him for a ride to purchase drugs.    Finkle, who was\n\nat Richard O'Leary's house, had previously smoked crack cocaine\n\nwith O'Laughlin and knew a drug dealer.      Finkle and O'Leary, a\n\ntaxicab driver, arrived at O'Laughlin's apartment an hour later.\n\nHowever, they soon left without giving O'Laughlin a ride because\n\nO'Laughlin was unable to secure money for cab fare.4\n\n          In the early morning hours of November 17, between 12:10\n\nand 1:43 a.m., fourteen telephone calls were placed to or from\n\nO'Laughlin's apartment. The majority of these calls were placed to\n\nknown drug dealers.\n\n          Shortly before 2:00 a.m. George Whittemore, a neighbor\n\nliving directly above Mrs. Kotowski, awakened to a woman screaming\n\ndirectly below and the sound of \"wood hitting wood.\"   According to\n\n\n\n\n4\n   O'Leary refused to drive unless O'Laughlin provided him with an\nadvance payment.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fWhittemore, a carpenter by profession, these sounds lasted for\n\nabout thirty seconds.\n\n           Whittemore dialed 911 at 1:55 a.m. He stayed awake until\n\nthe police arrived and flashed his apartment lights to indicate his\n\napartment to the police.         Between the time he called 911 and when\n\nthe police arrived, Whittemore did not hear any vehicles arrive or\n\ndepart from the area.      The police later conducted a reenactment of\n\nthe 911 call.       Based on this reenactment, they concluded that a\n\nperson   standing    in   Mrs.    Kotowski's   bedroom    could   have   heard\n\nWhittemore's footsteps as he walked to the telephone as well as\n\nWhittemore's voice, but would have been unable to make out what was\n\nbeing said.\n\n           Officers William Tierney and Phillip Skowron arrived six\n\nor seven minutes after Whittemore's 911 call.            They were unable to\n\nfind apartment number 202, the apartment reported in the dispatch,\n\nbecause the apartment numbers at the complex had been recently\n\nrenumbered.     They did not note anything unusual, but observed\n\nO'Laughlin walking from the building on a walkway leading from\n\napartment number 19.      O'Laughlin was wearing only boxer shorts and\n\nOfficer Tierney testified that O'Laughlin appeared \"impervious\" to\n\nthe near-freezing temperature.\n\n           O'Laughlin questioned the officers regarding what had\n\nhappened and the officers answered that they were responding to a\n\nreport of a woman screaming.        When they asked him if he had heard\n\nany screaming, O'Laughlin replied that he had been awakened by\n\n                                      -6-\n\fscreaming, but believed it to be a raccoon trapped in a dumpster.5\n\nO'Laughlin explained that he had placed a stick in the dumpster so\n\nthat it could escape.     Officer Tierney then looked inside the\n\ndumpster and saw a stick, but no animal.   The SJC noted that during\n\nhis conversation with the officers, O'Laughlin seemed \"uneasy and\n\ndistant,\" not making eye contact with them.       The police further\n\nsearched the area, but left after finding nothing suspicious.\n\n           Whittemore testified that throughout the night he heard\n\na woman moaning and crying directly below him.6     He also testified\n\nthat later in the morning, he heard the sound of glass breaking,\n\nbanging, and a man outside Mrs. Kotowski's apartment calling her\n\nname.   The man subsequently yelled \"Oh, my God.\"\n\n           The man Whittemore was referring to was Mrs. Kotowski's\n\nboyfriend, Finn, who had arrived at 5:45 a.m. at Mrs. Kotowski's\n\napartment.   On weekdays, Finn routinely joined Mrs. Kotowski for a\n\nmorning coffee prior to starting his workday.     On this particular\n\nmorning, when Finn knocked on the door, he only heard her say, \"Who\n\nis it?\" in a strange voice.       After failing to reach her from a\n\nnearby public telephone, Finn testified that he forced open a\n\nlocked sliding glass rear door.    Although the living room appeared\n\nto be in order, he found Mrs. Kotowski lying on the floor next to\n\n\n\n5\n   O'Laughlin's supervisor testified that the complex had been\nhaving problems with raccoons getting caught in the dumpster.\n6\n   Although he heard these sounds, Whittemore did not contact the\npolice again that night.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthe bed.   He testified that \"there was just blood everywhere.\"\n\nFinn dialed 911 just before 6:30 a.m.        Mrs. Kotowski, who had\n\nsevere wounds on her head, was taken to Berkshire Medical Center.\n\nThe police ruled out Finn as a suspect because of his alibi (which\n\nthey confirmed), his reaction of shock upon discovering Mrs.\n\nKotowski, and his cooperation with the police.\n\n           Officers who arrived after Finn's 911 call observed blood\n\nin the victim's bedroom on the bed, the pillow, the floors, the\n\nwalls, and on the door jambs of the bathroom and bedroom.    The SJC\n\nnoted that the crime scene contained \"'quite a bit of blood' that\n\nappeared to be 'splatters' on the comforter.\"       Further, the bed\n\nrail was dented, with wood splinters on the ground beneath the\n\ndent. Officer Skowron testified that everything else was intact as\n\nthe apartment was neat and nothing was displaced.    Mrs. Kotowski's\n\npurse was on the floor, however.      Officer Skowron also testified\n\nthat there were no signs that the front door or the rear sliding\n\ndoor had been forced open (which contradicted a report by an\n\nearlier officer on the scene stating that the rear door was\n\nbroken); that the drawers were closed; and that the light and\n\nfigurines on the dresser were upright.      Mrs. Kotowski testified\n\nthat no items of value were missing from the apartment.        These\n\nitems, which were in plain view on top of the dresser, included\n\ndiamonds, pearls, and an expensive watch in the bedroom.       Also,\n\nMrs. Kotowski's purse contained her credit cards, about $28 in\n\ncash, and a checkbook.   There was $522 in cash in a dresser drawer.\n\n                                -8-\n\f          Constance Cappel, a neighbor who lived in the apartment\n\nbetween O'Laughlin and Mrs. Kotowski, testified that she heard\n\nvoices outside Mrs. Kotowski's apartment at about 6:45 a.m. Cappel\n\nwent outside and saw Mrs. Kotowski being loaded into an ambulance.\n\nShe knocked on O'Laughlin's door and told him that she thought\n\nsomeone had been murdered.        O'Laughlin, who answered the door in\n\nhis boxer shorts and looked like he had just awoken, responded\n\n\"What do you want me to do about it?\"\n\n          At 8:45 a.m. O'Laughlin came out of his apartment dressed\n\nfor work, approached one of his co-workers and Cappel, and inquired\n\nabout what was happening.          After his co-worker explained the\n\nsituation, O'Laughlin described his encounter with the police the\n\nprevious night and how he had been awakened by the police cruisers.\n\nO'Laughlin also informed his co-worker that he told the police that\n\nhe thought raccoons had been in the dumpster making a \"kind of\n\nsquealing sound.\"\n\n          At about 9:40 a.m., Officers Tierney and Todd Briggs\n\ntalked with O'Laughlin outside the apartment building and Officer\n\nTierney noticed a \"scratch or a dig mark in [O'Laughlin's] left\n\ncheek,   [a]   small   cut   on   his     chin    and   a   round,   circular\n\nbruise . . . just below his left ear.\"           Officer Tierney was unsure\n\nabout how fresh these marks were.\n\n          The SJC remarked that although O'Laughlin was initially\n\n\"reluctant,\" he agreed to give a statement at the police station\n\nwhen informed that Officer Tierney would conduct the interview.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fO'Laughlin arrived at the station at 10:40 a.m., but was told by\n\nChief Ronald Glidden to wait for Officer Tierney, who had yet to\n\narrive.    Officer Tierney arrived twenty minutes later and told\n\nO'Laughlin that he would be \"right with him.\"               However, when he\n\nreturned five minutes later, O'Laughlin had left.7\n\n            O'Laughlin returned to the police station twenty minutes\n\nlater and was interviewed by Chief Glidden for about ten minutes.\n\nChief Glidden testified that O'Laughlin \"seemed agitated\" during\n\nthe interview.         In his statement to Chief Glidden, O'Laughlin\n\nstated that he had been \"drinking before he went to bed and he just\n\ndidn't    think   he    was   awake    until   he   heard   the   cruisers   at\n\napproximately two o'clock.\"           He thought he may have heard foxes or\n\nraccoons before that, but was uncertain.            O'Laughlin said that he\n\nhad \"seen [the victim] around,\"; that he and a friend had joked\n\nabout her boyfriend; and that he had been in that apartment to\n\nrepair a window.       After the interview concluded, he went home.\n\n            State Troopers David Buell and Brian Berkel arrived at\n\nthe complex around noon.        Trooper Buell spoke to O'Laughlin, who\n\nstated that he had been out with his friend, Puleri, the previous\n\nnight, returned at 10:30 p.m., went to sleep around 11:30 p.m., and\n\nwas awakened by screaming, which he thought was a fox fighting with\n\n\n\n7\n   O'Laughlin's co-worker testified that O'Laughlin went back to\nthe apartment complex and told him the person O'Laughlin was\nsupposed to meet was not there.     After discussing the matter\nfurther, O'Laughlin decided to go back to the police station\naccompanied by his co-worker.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fa raccoon.     O'Laughlin said that a short time later the police\n\narrived and he went out to speak with them.          After the officers\n\nleft, he slept until 7:30 a.m., when he was awakened by his\n\nneighbor, who had informed him that there had been a murder.\n\n           Trooper Buell asked O'Laughlin for consent to search his\n\napartment in order to eliminate him as a suspect and because his\n\napartment was in close proximity to Mrs. Kotowski's apartment.\n\nO'Laughlin    consented,   and   allowed   Trooper    Berkel   to   take\n\nphotographs and two police chemists to search for blood stains.\n\nTrooper Berkel photographed a red stain on a closet door near the\n\nkitchen area.    A chemist who saw the stain asked O'Laughlin if his\n\nconsent included taking swabbings.      O'Laughlin responded that it\n\ndid not.   Soon thereafter, O'Laughlin asked the officers to leave\n\nhis apartment.\n\n           Outside the apartment, the police decided to apply for a\n\nsearch warrant.      They returned to O'Laughlin's apartment and\n\ninformed him of their intent to secure the apartment and obtain a\n\nwarrant.     O'Laughlin replied that they did not need to pursue a\n\nwarrant because he would allow them back into the apartment.         He\n\nalso told the officers that he had wiped the red stain off the\n\ncloset door with his finger, and thought it was his own blood, but\n\nwas not certain.   O'Laughlin told the police that he was concerned\n\nabout a search because he was afraid police would find his drug\n\nparaphernalia and because he possessed money that he did not want\n\ntaken.     Trooper Buell asked O'Laughlin to give him the drug\n\n                                 -11-\n\fparaphernalia, telling him that he would not be charged with drug\n\npossession.\n\n              When the chemists returned to the apartment, the red\n\nstain on the closet door was gone.             However, the area, where the\n\nstain had been, tested positive for the presumptive presence of\n\nblood.    The chemists collected a sample by swabbing.8\n\n              A   state   trooper   searched    the   area   surrounding   the\n\napartment complex with a dog trained to search by scent.               The dog\n\nfound    an   aluminum    bat   about   twenty-five     yards   away   from   a\n\nbuilding's dumpster in the woods.           It appeared to be covered in\n\nleaves and debris, but was otherwise clean.           O'Laughlin's name was\n\ninscribed on the bat.\n\n              On November 20, O'Laughlin called a friend and informed\n\nhim that he was a suspect in the assault.               The SJC noted that\n\nO'Laughlin was \"upset\" while he told his friend that he was \"very\n\nhappy that [Mrs. Kotowski] had survived . . . [s]o that she could\n\nidentify her assailant,\" but with his bad luck the assailant could\n\nhave been wearing a \"Nixon mask\" and entered with a baseball bat.\n\n\n\n\n8\n   Chemists also collected swabs from two small, red-brown stains\nin the apartment that tested positive for the presumptive presence\nof blood, and cuttings of what appeared to be blood from\nO'Laughlin's bed comforter. O'Laughlin handed over to the police\nthe clothes he said he wore the previous night and permitted the\nchemist to examine his boots.\n\n                                     -12-\n\f            Later    that    day    O'Laughlin     was    arrested.    While    in\n\ncustody, O'Laughlin told an inmate that although he owned the bat,\n\nhe last saw it when he moved into his apartment.9\n\n            The police recovered fourteen fingerprints and one palm\n\nprint from Mrs. Kotowski's apartment, none of which matched those\n\nof O'Laughlin.10     In addition, footprint impressions taken at the\n\napartment    did    not     match   O'Laughlin's      boots.      State   Police\n\nLieutenant   Brian    O'Hara,       trained   in   fingerprint     analysis    and\n\nbloodstain patterns, opined that a blood stain on Mrs. Kotowski's\n\npillow   was caused by the transfer of blood from a person's right\n\nhand, but the handprint was unidentifiable.                He testified that the\n\nhand had to have had a significant amount of blood on it, not all\n\nof which would have been transferred.\n\n            A state police chemist examined the aluminum bat found in\n\nthe woods.    Three small reddish brown stains on the bat tested\n\npositive for the presumptive presence of blood, only one of which\n\ntested positive for human blood. The three stains were swabbed and\n\nsent to the DNA unit for further testing.                There was contamination\n\nin the DNA lab, and thus the tests consumed all the testable\n\nmaterial without yielding results. An additional cutting from tape\n\n\n\n9\n   At booking, O'Laughlin remarked during his photograph that the\nmark on his face was a pimple. Trooper Michael Hill thought it was\na blemish or an injury.\n10\n     Twelve of these prints were identifiable and excluded\nO'Laughlin; two were unidentifiable; and one was identifiable, but\npolice could not match it to any known prints.\n\n                                       -13-\n\fon the bat's handle, an area where the presumptive presence of\n\nblood could still be detected, was submitted to the laboratory.     A\n\nstate police DNA analyst concluded that while Mrs. Kotowski could\n\nnot be excluded as a contributor, one in two of any randomly\n\nselected individuals could have been the contributor.11\n\n             A surgeon who performed reconstructive surgeries on Mrs.\n\nKotowski after the attack testified that she had sustained between\n\nfifteen to twenty blows that broke nearly every bone in her face\n\nand skull.    The only exception was her jaw.   She also had defensive\n\nwounds on her hands caused by five to ten blows.     The surgeon gave\n\nan opinion that Mrs. Kotowski's injuries were caused by a long,\n\nsturdy, hard, round object, consistent with an aluminum bat that\n\nwas recovered in the woods on the day of the attack.\n\n             B.   Procedural History\n\n             In December 2000, A Berkshire County grand jury charged\n\nO'Laughlin with four offenses: (1) burglary and armed assault in a\n\ndwelling, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, § 14; (2) armed assault in\n\na dwelling, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 18A; (3) armed assault\n\nwith intent to murder, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 18(b); and\n\n\n\n11\n   Because of the contamination, only the following samples were\ndeemed adequate for further testing: blood on Mrs. Kotowski's\nbathroom floor; a stain on the wall behind O'Laughlin's dresser;\nand two cuttings from O'Laughlin's comforter. Of these samples, it\nwas concluded that all of the blood found in O'Laughlin's apartment\nbelonged to him, and O'Laughlin was excluded as a possible\ncontributor to the sample of blood taken from Mrs. Kotowski's\nbathroom.\n\n                                  -14-\n\f(4) assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, see Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 265, § 15A(b).\n\n           Following a nine-day jury trial in May 2002, O'Laughlin\n\nwas convicted of all four charges.                 O'Laughlin appealed.\n\n                     1.   The Massachusetts Appeals Court Opinion\n\n           On appeal, the Massachusetts Appeals Court concluded that\n\nthere was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdicts.\n\nThe Appeals Court stated that while the government's evidence\n\ndemonstrated    that      O'Laughlin         had    a    motive   of       robbery,    an\n\nopportunity to commit the crime, a means to commit the crime, and\n\na consciousness of guilt, the evidence was not enough to establish\n\nguilt.    The Appeals Court concluded that \"[n]othing in the record\n\nsufficiently    links     the    defendant         to   the   crime   to    permit    the\n\nconclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the perpetrator\"\n\nand that \"[p]iling inference upon inference does not amount to\n\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" O'Laughlin I, 830 N.E.2d at 231-\n\n32.   In reaching its conclusion, the Appeals Court noted that the\n\nbat was only \"consistent\" with the weapon used in the attack; that\n\nO'Laughlin's lies to the police concerning his whereabouts and his\n\nremoval   of   the   stain      from   his    closet      door,   \"while      certainly\n\npermissible to show a guilty conscience, cannot fill the gap in the\n\nproof of identity\"; that O'Laughlin did not show physical strain in\n\nhis appearance and demeanor when confronted by the police just\n\nabout twelve minutes after the attack, which would have been\n\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fconsistent with someone who had just committed such a \"brutal\"\n\nattack; and that the third-party culprit evidence in this case\n\ndetracted from the government's case.            Id. at 232-34.           Thus, the\n\nAppeals Court reversed O'Laughlin's convictions and directed that\n\njudgments be entered in his favor.\n\n                    2.     The SJC Opinion\n\n           The    Commonwealth       then    sought    and    received      further\n\nappellate review from the SJC. The SJC concluded that the evidence\n\nagainst    O'Laughlin      had     been     sufficient       and    affirmed    his\n\nconvictions,     stating    that    circumstantial         evidence    of   motive,\n\nopportunity,     means,    and     consciousness      of    guilt     \"permissibly\n\nconvinced the jury of the defendant's guilt.\"                O'Laughlin II, 843\n\nN.E.2d at 627.\n\n           The SJC stated that the jury could permissibly find that\n\nO'Laughlin's motive to break into Mrs. Kotowski's apartment was\n\nrobbery.   Id.    It pointed to the fact that O'Laughlin had taken\n\ndrugs twice previously on the night of November 16, had \"run out\"\n\nof drugs and money, and was calling around as late as 1:43 a.m. to\n\npurchase drugs, which the SJC noted was \"only twelve minutes before\n\nthe victims' upstairs neighbor telephoned the police department to\n\nreport screams and banging sounds from downstairs.\"                   Id.\n\n           The SJC further noted that O'Laughlin had previously\n\nentered the victim's apartment and \"had reason to believe that she\n\nwas wealthy and might have cash or valuables.\"                      Id.     The SJC\n\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fcommented that O'Laughlin \"needed money immediately and the victim\n\nwas a nearby and likely source.\"            Id.    Accounting for the fact that\n\nnothing   was    taken      from   the    apartment,      the    SJC   pointed     to   a\n\nreenactment during trial demonstrating that the neighbor could be\n\nheard in the apartment below when he called the police.                       The SJC\n\nconcluded that \"[i]t is a reasonable inference that the defendant\n\nwas frightened off before he could steal anything when he heard the\n\nneighbor speaking.\"         Id. at 627 n.11.\n\n           The       SJC    also    concluded      that     O'Laughlin       had    the\n\nopportunity     to    commit   the   crime       because    he   resided     only   two\n\napartment doors away from Mrs. Kotowski and that he had a master\n\nkey which gave him access to her apartment.                       Id. at 627.           In\n\naddition, the SJC pointed to Whittemore's testimony that he did not\n\nhear any cars going to or from the apartment complex in the\n\ninterval between when he first heard the screaming and when the\n\npolice arrived.       Id.\n\n           The SJC also reasoned that O'Laughlin had the means to\n\ncommit the crime by stating that the aluminum bat was found a short\n\ndistance from Mrs. Kotowski's apartment complex.                       Id.    The SJC\n\nstated that \"[t]he jury would certainly be warranted in concluding\n\nthat the bat was the defendant's.\"                Id.      The SJC explained that\n\n\"[h]is surname, not a common one, was visible on the bat handle and\n\nhe mentioned to someone in jail that he was the owner of the bat\n\nthe police had found.\"         Id.       The SJC further noted, however, that\n\nalthough the bat was covered by some leaves and debris, it was\n\n                                          -17-\n\fotherwise \"clean\" when discovered.                   Id.     It also acknowledged\n\nO'Laughlin's statement that he had not seen the bat since the day\n\nhe had moved into his apartment.           Id. at 627 n.12.\n\n              Most notably, the SJC indicated the significant evidence\n\npointing to O'Laughlin's consciousness of guilt.                       Id. at 627.\n\nFirst, the SJC referenced O'Laughlin's demeanor when the police\n\nfirst arrived on the scene and discovered O'Laughlin outside in his\n\n\"boxer shorts in near freezing temperature.\"                     Id.   The SJC noted\n\nthat when he talked with the police, he was \"uneasy and distant\"\n\nand did not make eye contact with the police officers.                    Id.   Also,\n\nthe SJC remarked that the differing versions O'Laughlin gave to\n\npolice   as    to   the   reason   he    woke    up        was   indicative   of   his\n\nuntruthfulness.12         Id. at 627-28.         The SJC further noted that\n\nO'Laughlin reluctantly participated in an interview with the police\n\nand seemed \"agitated\" when he spoke with them.                    Id. at 628.\n\n              Moreover, the SJC pointed to O'Laughlin's reaction to the\n\npolice's request when they asked for a swabbing of the red stain in\n\nthe closet door of his apartment.              Id.    Although O'Laughlin later\n\nallowed the police to return, the stain was gone and O'Laughlin\n\n12\n   The SJC stated that O'Laughlin lied to the police when he told\nthem that he was awakened by the screaming, but his telephone\nrecords show that he was making phone calls until twenty minutes\nbefore the police arrived on the scene. He later told the police\nthat the police cruisers woke him up. Also, he told the police in\nan another interview that he went to bed at 11:30 p.m., awoke to\nscreaming that he believed were animals fighting, went back to\nsleep and awoke to his neighbor's knock on his door who was there\nto inform O'Laughlin that Mrs. Kotowski was severely beaten. Id.\nat 627-28.\n\n                                        -18-\n\fadmitted to having removed it with his finger, saying that he\n\nbelieved that it was his own blood.             The SJC concluded that \"[t]his\n\nevidence reflected not merely a general consciousness of guilt, but\n\nindicated that the defendant feared that the blood stain could be\n\nthat of the victim, a fear he would have only if he were in fact\n\nthe perpetrator.\"     Id.\n\n            Finally, the SJC pointed to the fact that O'Laughlin had\n\n\"a 'scratch or dig mark' on his cheek, a small cut on his chin and\n\na bruise on his neck.\"        Id.        While acknowledging that the police\n\nofficer could not discern whether the marks were \"fresh,\" the SJC\n\nconcluded   that   \"it    could     be    inferred    that   the   injuries     were\n\nsustained during a physical encounter with the victim.\"                   Id.\n\n            In sum, the SJC stated that the evidence taken together\n\n\"was sufficient to permit the jury to determine beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that the defendant was the perpetrator of the vicious attack\n\non the victim.\"     Id.\n\n            In reversing the lower appellate court decision, the SJC\n\ndistinguished its case law in Commonwealth v. Mazza, 504 N.E.2d 630\n\n(Mass. 1987), stating that in the instant case the prosecution\n\n\"presented more evidence linking [O'Laughlin] to the assault.\"\n\nO'Laughlin II, 843 N.E.2d at 629.               Furthermore, the instant case\n\ncontained evidence of means as represented by the aluminum bat,\n\n\"significantly     stronger    evidence         of   consciousness   of    guilt,\"\n\nbruises on O'Laughlin's face, and the fact that O'Laughlin was\n\nwearing only boxers when the police found him, which \"would be\n\n                                         -19-\n\fconsistent with his having disposed of bloody outer garments.\" Id.\n\nWith respect to O'Laughlin's attire, the SJC added that \"[t]he jury\n\ncould find that, had the defendant gone outside to check for\n\nanimals in the dumpster (as he claimed), it was implausible that he\n\nwould have done so without putting on at least minimal clothing,\n\nnot only for purposes of protection against the cold but also for\n\npurposes of decency.\"   Id.\n\n          The SJC disagreed with the weight placed by the Appeals\n\nCourt on the fact that O'Laughlin \"did not manifest any signs of\n\nrecent physical exertion (sweat, shortness of breath, wet hair or\n\ndisarray)\" twelve minutes after the attack.   Id.   at 629 n.13.   The\n\nSJC stated that this did not detract from the government's case\n\nbecause twelve minutes after the attack there would be no reason\n\nfor O'Laughlin to show signs of this physical exertion.     Id.\n\n          Also, the SJC disagreed with the Appeals Court that the\n\nthird-party culprit evidence presented in this case detracted from\n\nthe government's argument or affected the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence because it was not \"so overwhelming that no rational jury\n\ncould conclude that the defendant was guilty.\"      Id. at 630.    The\n\nSJC stated that the third-party culprit evidence \"simply tended to\n\ncontradict the Commonwealth's evidence; it did not show it to be\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fincredible or conclusively incorrect.\"13       Id. (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n                     3.   O'Laughlin's Habeas Petition\n\n          In   his    habeas   petition   before   the   district   court,\n\nO'Laughlin alleged that (1) the evidence at trial was insufficient\n\n\n13\n    The SJC noted O'Laughlin's third-party culprit evidence in a\nfootnote:\n\n     The defense sought to portray the victim's husband, from\n     whom she had recently separated, as the third-party\n     culprit. The husband was aware of the wife's new address\n     and that she was involved with another man. The victim\n     described the husband as being \"upset\" but not angry\n     about this relationship.       Others said the husband\n     alternated between being \"nice\" and verbally abusive. The\n     husband testified that he was at home at the time of the\n     assault and that he received two telephone calls just\n     before 6 a.m. Each time his \"caller ID\" indicated the\n     source of the call as the victim's apartment, but no one\n     was on the line.      He dialed the number, and a man\n     answered. One witness thought he saw the husband's car\n     in his workplace parking lot at approximately 6 a.m. on\n     the morning of the attack, but a neighbor saw the\n     husband's car parked at home at 6:20 a.m. The husband\n     was generally cooperative with the police, but did not\n     permit the police access to \"personal\" letters to his\n     wife. Tests indicated the presumptive presence of blood\n     on one of the husband's forearms on the day of the\n     attack.   On the evening of November 17, the police\n     observed garbage bags on the floor of the husband's\n     garage and dark clothing in a clothes dryer. Two wet\n     towels strongly smelling of bleach were found in a\n     plastic bag in the trunk of the husband's car. One of\n     the towels was the same as towels found in the victim's\n     linen closet.    The husband explained that the towels\n     smelled because he did not know how to do laundry and had\n     used too much bleach on them. He said he brought them on\n     a hunting trip the previous weekend and had forgotten\n     them in the trunk.     Finally, the husband kept wooden\n     baseball bats and other athletic equipment in his garage.\n\nId. at 630 n.14.\n\n                                   -21-\n\fto prove that he was a perpetrator of the offenses for which he was\n\nconvicted; and (2) the trial court violated his right to present a\n\ndefense     by    excluding     a    handwritten      note    that,     according   to\n\nO'Laughlin, supported his third-party culprit defense.                          After\n\nbriefing by the parties and a non-evidentiary hearing, the district\n\ncourt denied O'Laughlin's petition reasoning that \"like the courts\n\nthat have looked at this cold record before me, this is a close\n\nquestion.        But the petition must be under federal law denied.\"\n\n             O'Laughlin then filed a timely notice of appeal and\n\nrequested     a    Certificate       of    Appealability      (\"COA\")     as   to   his\n\nsufficiency and right-to-present a defense claims.                      The district\n\ncourt granted a COA with respect to both issues.\n\n                                II.       Discussion\n\n             A.     Standard of Review\n\n             We review de novo the district court's decision to grant\n\nor deny a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2254.                  Healy, 453 F.3d\n\nat 25.

No. 104-132, § 104, 110 Stat. 1214, 1219\n\n(1996), a federal court shall not grant a petition for habeas\n\nrelief \"with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the\n\nmerits in State court proceedings\" unless the state court decision:\n\n1) \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\n\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\n\nof   the   United     States\"       or    2)   \"was   based   on   an   unreasonable\n\n\n\n                                           -22-\n\fdetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in\n\nthe State court proceeding.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1)-(2). \"A state\n\ncourt's   findings   on   factual   issues    'shall   be   presumed    to   be\n\ncorrect' and the petitioner bears the burden of disproving factual\n\nfindings by 'clear and convincing evidence.'\"               McCambridge, 303\n\nF.3d at 34-35 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1)).\n\n           Sufficiency     claims   are     generally14     evaluated     under\n\n§ 2254(d)(1) and we look to \"whether the state court decision\n\nconstitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established\n\nSupreme Court case law.\"      Hurtado v.

Virginia,       443 U.S. 307 (1979).            Under Jackson, due\n\nprocess requires that \"no person shall be made to suffer the onus\n\nof a criminal conviction except upon sufficient proof - defined as\n\nevidence necessary to convince a trier of fact beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt of the existence of every element of the offense.\" Id. at\n\n316.    More succinctly, the relevant test we take from Jackson is\n\n\"whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id. at\n\n319 (emphasis in original).\n\n            Thus, for our purposes, we must decide whether the SJC's\n\napplication     of   Jackson    to   O'Laughlin's    case   was    \"objectively\n\nunreasonable.\"       Although \"[t]he term 'unreasonable' is no doubt\n\ndifficult to define,\" Hurtado, 245 F.3d at 17 (quoting Williams v.\n\nTaylor, 529 U.S. 362, 410 (2000)), we have explained that \"some\n\nincrement of incorrectness beyond error is required.\" McCambridge,\n\n303 F.3d at 36 (quoting Francis S. v. Stone, 221 F.3d 100, 111 (2d\n\nCir. 2000)).     \"The increment need not necessarily be great, but it\n\nmust be great enough to make the decision unreasonable in the\n\n                                      -24-\n\findependent and objective judgment of the federal court.\" Id.15   To\n\nbe sure, \"the gap between erroneous state court decisions and\n\nunreasonable ones is narrow,\"    Evans v.

Analysis of the SJC Opinion\n\n          As our sister court has noted, \"[a]lthough circumstantial\n\nevidence alone can support a conviction, there are times that it\n\namounts to only a reasonable speculation and not to sufficient\n\nevidence.\"   Newman, 543 F.3d at 796.        This is such a case.\n\n          The instant facts may support a reasonable speculation\n\nthat O'Laughlin was the assailant, but not sufficient evidence to\n\nestablish his guilt.   Taken together, the circumstantial evidence\n\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\fin this case, even when drawing all reasonable inferences in favor\n\nof the prosecution, does not permit any rational jury to conclude\n\nthat O'Laughlin was the assailant beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n             Specifically, the evidence that O'Laughlin acted upon a\n\nfinancial motive to commit the attack is weak at best.                     A jury\n\ncould permissibly conclude that he needed money to acquire crack\n\ncocaine, giving him reason to break into Mrs. Kotowski's apartment,\n\na person whom he knew had money.         However, Mrs. Kotowski testified\n\nthat nothing of value was taken and no items, not even expensive\n\njewelry in plain view, were disturbed.            The SJC accounted for this\n\nfact by stating that the jury could draw \"a reasonable inference\n\nthat   the   defendant    was    frightened   off   before   he    could    steal\n\nanything     when   he   heard   the   neighbor     [Whittemore]    speaking.\"\n\nO'Laughlin II, 843 N.E.2d at 627 n.11.               Even if the assailant\n\ndeduced that the neighbor was calling the police in response to the\n\nattack,18 no rational juror could conclude that the placement of\n\nthis phone call frightened him off given the volume and duration of\n\nMrs. Kotowski's screams.          Moreover, the assailant's actions are\n\ninconsistent with O'Laughlin's purported financial motive in view\n\nof the savage beating Mrs. Kotowski suffered at the hands of the\n\nassailant, an attack involving at least fifteen to twenty blows\n\nthat nearly broke every bone in her face and skull.                        If the\n\n\n\n\n18\n    A reenactment demonstrated that the assailant would not have\nbeen able to make out that Whittemore was calling the police.\n\n                                       -31-\n\fassailant were motivated by money, a few blows to incapacitate her\n\nwould have been sufficient.\n\n          With respect to the opportunity to commit the crime,\n\nO'Laughlin had a master key and there were no signs of forced\n\nentry; thus, one possible inference is that O'Laughlin used his\n\nmaster key to enter Mrs. Kotowski's apartment.        It is notable,\n\nhowever, that several others on the maintenance staff possessed a\n\nmaster key. Also, Mrs. Kotowski could have let someone familiar to\n\nher into the apartment.\n\n          With respect to the means for the attack, a jury could\n\npermissibly find that the aluminum bat found in the woods was\n\nO'Laughlin's bat given that his name was on the bat and that he\n\nadmitted to owning the bat at one time.        Yet, there was little\n\nevidence connecting the aluminum bat, a non-unique item in a\n\nresidential complex, to the crime scene apart from the fact that it\n\nwas found twenty-five yards from the residential complex the\n\nfollowing day and the use of such an object was \"consistent\" with\n\nMrs. Kotowski's injuries.19   Of course, any bat likely would have\n\nbeen consistent with her injuries.     Also, Whittemore, a carpenter,\n\ntestified that he heard \"wood hitting wood,\" as opposed to hearing\n\n\n\n19\n   This is not to say that each of us is convinced that the state\ncourt's decision is unreasonable in every respect. But this case\ncomes to us on arguments as presented by the parties. This panel\nmay not be in complete unanimity in all particulars, but we do\nagree that the petitioner has the better of the argument with\nrespect to the means evidence introduced by the prosecution at\ntrial.\n\n                                -32-\n\fthe   sound    of    a    hollow   aluminum   bat,    when   he   was     awakened.\n\nFurthermore, wooden bats were found in Mrs. Kotowski's estranged\n\nhusband's garage.\n\n              We next turn to O'Laughlin's consciousness of guilt,\n\nwhich   the    SJC   considered     the   strongest    evidence      in   favor   of\n\nreinstating the conviction.20 When viewed in context, this evidence\n\nis minimally probative on the question of whether O'Laughlin was\n\nthe assailant.\n\n              Notwithstanding the fact that it was just after 2:00\n\na.m., the SJC cited to O'Laughlin's \"uneasy and distant\" demeanor\n\nand his unwillingness to look Officers Tierney and Skowron in the\n\neye   when    they   confronted     him   just   minutes     after   the    attack.\n\nHowever, both officers, even though they were responding to reports\n\nof a possible assault, did not consider O'Laughlin's behavior\n\nsuspicious at the time. Indeed, they initially believed he was the\n\nreporting party and after asking him a few brief questions they\n\nleft the area.           Even the fact that O'Laughlin was only clad in\n\nboxers in near-freezing temperature did not give them pause after\n\nhe explained to them that he was awakened by animal screams and had\n\ngone outside to place a stick in the dumpster, a fact Officer\n\n\n\n20\n   We compare infra the consciousness of guilt evidence in our case\nto that of Juan H. v. Allen, 408 F.3d 1262 (9th Cir. 2005). In\nJuan H., the Ninth Circuit granted habeas relief to a petitioner in\npart because it viewed that any conclusion regarding the\npetitioner's guilt based on the prosecution's consciousness of\nguilt evidence amounted to no more than \"bare conjecture.\" Id. at\n1277.\n\n                                       -33-\n\fTierney promptly verified.       Also, the SJC explained that a jury\n\ncould find it \"implausible\" that O'Laughlin would have gone outside\n\nwithout \"putting on at least minimal clothing\" if his true reason\n\nfor going outside was to check for animals.          Yet, Officer Tierney\n\nstated    that    O'Laughlin   appeared    unfazed    by   the   cold    and\n\nO'Laughlin's alibi shows that he did not intend to stay outside for\n\na very long time.\n\n           The other consciousness of guilt evidence cited by the\n\nSJC -- O'Laughlin's reluctance to be interviewed by the police, the\n\ninconsistent versions of how he was awoken, his reaction to the\n\nneighbor's report of an assault, the fact that he was agitated\n\nduring the interview, and his reaction when the police wanted to\n\nswab his closet door -- while not helpful to his case, are not\n\nenough,    even    when   considered      in   combination    with      other\n\ncircumstantial evidence, to allow a jury to permissibly conclude\n\nO'Laughlin's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n           With respect to this evidence, the fact that O'Laughlin\n\nwas reluctant to come down to the police station and displayed some\n\nagitation during the interview has minimal probative value in\n\ndetermining whether O'Laughlin was the assailant.            Although this\n\nbehavior could indicate consciousness of guilt for some crime, such\n\nas possessing crack cocaine (which the evidence shows he admitted\n\nto being concerned about), it is an impermissible inferential leap\n\nfor a jury to find this behavior significantly probative of whether\n\n\n\n                                  -34-\n\fO'Laughlin    committed   such   a    brutal    attack.21      Likewise,      his\n\nindifferent reaction to his neighbor informing him of the attack\n\nthe following morning may bear on whether he was a compassionate\n\nperson, but has little probative value in assessing O'Laughlin's\n\nguilt.\n\n            Admittedly, the conflicting versions O'Laughlin gave the\n\npolice as to how he was awoken and his reaction to the police's\n\nrequest to swab his closet door when they were searching his home\n\ncould be probative evidence linking O'Laughlin to the crime.\n\nHowever, in light of O'Laughlin's concerns that the police would\n\ndiscover his drug use, this evidence was insufficient to serve as\n\nthe primary basis upon which the jury could rely to conclude\n\nO'Laughlin's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n            Lastly, the SJC cited bruises and marks on O'Laughlin's\n\nface   as   evidence   from   which    the     jury   could   infer    that   an\n\naltercation    occurred   between      O'Laughlin      and    Mrs.    Kotowski.\n\nHowever, these bruises and marks have minimal, if any, probative\n\nforce given the fact that they were not even noted by Officers\n\nTierney and Skowron when they were responding to an assault just\n\nminutes after the attack.\n\n            It bears repeating that the prosecution had to rely on\n\ncircumstantial evidence because no physical or DNA evidence linked\n\n21\n   This is not a case where the defendant stonewalled the police.\nHe approached the police just minutes after the attack, he\nsubmitted to a ten-minute interview with the Chief of Police, and\nultimately allowed the police to search his apartment.\n\n                                     -35-\n\fO'Laughlin to the attack despite the copious amount of blood at the\n\ncrime    scene.         Considering   the     large   amount    of   blood,    it    is\n\ndifficult to fathom how O'Laughlin was able to avoid having any\n\nblood or other DNA evidence connect him to Mrs. Kotowski.                      Given\n\nthe insufficiency of the evidence, circumstantial or otherwise,\n\ntying O'Laughlin to the attack, we conclude that a rational jury\n\ncould not find O'Laughlin's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n            D.   Objectively Unreasonable Standard for Purposes of\n            Habeas Review\n\n            Although we have identified several gaps in the SJC's\n\nanalysis, we are mindful that on habeas review under AEDPA we are\n\nnot permitted to grant a writ if we merely disagree with the jury\n\nverdict or if we identify an error in the SJC's reasoning.                          The\n\nrelevant inquiry is whether the SJC was objectively unreasonable in\n\nupholding the conviction.\n\n            We once again acknowledge the extremely high bar that\n\nmust be overcome on habeas review to overturn a state court\n\ndecision; however, that bar is not insurmountable and on rare\n\noccasions we have held a state court decision to be objectively\n\nunreasonable.       See, e.g., White, 399 F.3d at 25 (holding on habeas\n\nreview    that    state     court   unreasonably      applied    Supreme      Court's\n\nConfrontation       Clause       jurisprudence    where   state      court    barred\n\npetitioner       from    cross    examining    complainants      regarding     prior\n\naccusations).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\f           This court has identified certain guidelines that it\n\nfinds useful in analyzing sufficiency claims on habeas review.22\n\nIn addition, we note that although we evaluate the state court\n\ndecision in light of Supreme Court precedent, we are not precluded\n\nfrom looking at other federal court decisions that may help guide\n\nus in applying the Jackson standard.            Indeed, \"'[d]ecisions from\n\nthe lower federal courts may help inform the AEDPA analysis to the\n\nextent   that    they   state   the   clearly    established       federal     law\n\ndetermined   by   the   Supreme   Court.'\"        Evans,     518   F.3d   at    10\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting Aspen v.

(alteration    in\n\noriginal) (quoting Rashad v. Walsh, 300 F.3d 35 (1st Cir. 2002)).\n\nUnder § 2254(d)(1), we are not constrained in our \"ability to draw\n\nfrom any legal source in determining whether the state court's\n\ndecision rests on constitutional error or is an unreasonable\n\napplication of Supreme Court precedent. [Section 2254(d)(1)] only\n\nlimits the grounds on which habeas relief may be granted.\"              Id.\n\n            With this in mind, we look to a recent case, Newman v.\n\nMetrish, where the Sixth Circuit held a state court ruling to be\n\nobjectively unreasonable on grounds that the prosecution did not\n\npresent sufficient evidence to support a prosecution for murder of\n\na known drug dealer.       543 F.3d at 797.      In Newman, the prosecution\n\npresented evidence at trial that the petitioner planned to rob drug\n\ndealers for drugs or money; that the victim was a known drug dealer\n\nwho kept drugs in his freezer; that the petitioner and the victim\n\nwere known to engage in drug transactions in the past; that the\n\nvictim's freezer was \"open and empty\" after he was killed; and that\n\nthe petitioner had a motive for the killing because he had seen the\n\nvictim \"make a pass\" at the petitioner's girlfriend.              Id. at 794.\n\nFurthermore,     the    prosecution   presented    evidence    supporting     an\n\ninference that Newman had possessed and once purchased the murder\n\nweapon. Id. This evidence included forensic evidence and the fact\n\n\n\n\n                                      -38-\n\fthat the petitioner's friend saw a gun similar to the murder weapon\n\nin the petitioner's home a few weeks prior to the murder.23                Id.\n\n            In analyzing the evidence under Jackson, the Newman court\n\nstated that even when \"consider[ing] all of the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the prosecution, there remains reasonable\n\ndoubt because we are limited by what inferences reason will allow\n\nus to draw.\"        Id. at 797.       It remarked that these limitations\n\nincluded its ability to \"infer only that [the petitioner] intended\n\nto rob a drug dealer and knew that [the victim] was a drug dealer,\n\nthat a gun previously owned by [the petitioner] was used to kill\n\n[the victim], and that a similar looking gun was seen in [the\n\npetitioner's] home approximately two weeks before the murder.\" Id.\n\nThe Newman court added that \"even assuming that [the petitioner's]\n\ngun was indeed the one used in the homicide, there was no evidence\n\nof what happened to it between that date and the date of the\n\nhomicide,    and    we   need   not   speculate   as   to   what   might   have\n\nhappened.\"    Id.\n\n            The Newman court reasoned that while there was \"a wealth\n\nof information showing that [the petitioner] owned the gun,\"\n\n\n\n23\n   With respect to the murder weapon, the Newman court acknowledged\nthat \"the prosecution offered ample evidence to support an\ninference that [the petitioner] had previously possessed at least\none of the murder weapons.\" Id. at 795. However, it noted that\n\"the prosecution did not offer any evidence that [the petitioner]\nhad used or possessed the weapons on the day of the murder,\" any\n\"eyewitness testimony,\" any \"latent fingerprints from the crime\nscene or the items in the gym bag\" in which the alleged murder\nweapon was found. Id.\n\n                                      -39-\n\f\"evidence placing [the petitioner] at the scene\" was \"conspicuously\n\nabsent.\"     Id. at 797.       It pointed to the fact that there was no\n\neyewitness     testimony      and    the     police        did   not       recover   any\n\nfingerprints from the crime scene.                 Id.    The Newman court stated\n\nthat \"[w]ithout additional evidence placing [him] at the scene of\n\nthe   crime,   there   is     only   a    reasonable        speculation      that    [the\n\npetitioner] himself was present.\"                 Id.    It concluded that \"where\n\nthe evidence taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution\n\ncreates only a reasonable speculation that a defendant was present\n\nat the crime, there is insufficient evidence to satisfy the Jackson\n\nstandard.\"     Id.   Accordingly, the Newman court declared the state\n\ncourt ruling an unreasonable application of clearly established\n\nfederal law.     Id.\n\n           While Newman's reasoning certainly does not control our\n\nanalysis, it is significant that our sister court ruled a state\n\ncourt decision to be objectively unreasonable under Jackson on\n\nfacts more probative of a petitioner's guilt than what we have\n\nhere.   For example, O'Laughlin, like the petitioner in Newman, was\n\nnot connected to the crime scene by forensic evidence or eyewitness\n\ntestimony; however, unlike the petitioner in Newman who had prior\n\nbusiness dealings with the victim in that case, O'Laughlin had\n\nminimal    contact     with    the       victim     apart     from     a    few   casual\n\nconversations and a maintenance call.                   Moreover, the petitioner's\n\nrobbery motive in Newman was consistent with the evidence -- as the\n\nvictim's freezer, which was his storage place for drugs, was open\n\n                                          -40-\n\fand empty.24   In the instant case, however, O'Laughlin's alleged\n\nmotive of robbery to satisfy his need for crack cocaine does not\n\nalign with the fact that nothing of value was taken from Mrs.\n\nKotowski's apartment or with how savagely she was beaten at the\n\nhands of her assailant.   Lastly, in Newman, the petitioner owned a\n\ngun whose spent cartridges and bullets matched those found in the\n\nvictim's body.    Here, the aluminum baseball bat that O'Laughlin\n\nowned was merely \"consistent\" with Mrs. Kotowski's injuries, in the\n\nsame way a metal pipe or some other long, sturdy object would be\n\nconsistent with her injuries.\n\n            Another decision from a sister court also informs our\n\nanalysis as to whether the SJC unreasonably applied the Jackson\n\nstandard.    In Juan H. v. Allen, the Ninth Circuit held that the\n\nstate court decision was objectively unreasonable because there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to conclude that a juvenile petitioner aided\n\nand abetted a principal in committing first-degree murder and\n\nfirst-degree attempted murder.    408 F.3d at 1278-79.\n\n            In Juan H., the state court had concluded that the\n\npetitioner had \"manifested consciousness of guilt\" because he fled\n\nfrom the crime scene; he attempted to leave his home with his\n\nfamily after the shooting; and he gave a false alibi to the police\n\nthat he was in a trailer and not present during the shooting.   Id.\n\n\n\n24\n   Even if, in Newman, the petitioner's motive was anger because\nthe victim had made a pass at the petitioner's girlfriend, the\nvictim's gunshot wound is not inconsistent with this motive.\n\n                                 -41-\n\fat    1277.     Also,      as    motive   evidence,    the    state   court      cited\n\npetitioner's gang gestures towards the victim and the fact that the\n\npetitioner had punched the victim on a prior occasion.                    Id.\n\n              With respect to the evidence of flight, the Juan H. court\n\nreasoned that \"[n]o reasonable trier of fact could find evidence of\n\ncriminal culpability in the decision of a teenager to run home from\n\nthe scene of a shooting, regardless of whether the home was in the\n\nsame general direction as the car of a fleeing suspect.\"                   Id.     The\n\nJuan H. court added that \"[l]ikewise, any rational factfinder would\n\nfind   little    or   no    evidence      of   guilt   in    the   fact   that    [the\n\npetitioner] attempted, along with the rest of his family, to leave\n\nhis home as it was being surrounded by an angry mob of neighbors.\"\n\nId.\n\n              Regarding the false alibi, the Juan H. court remarked\n\nthat it was \"bare conjecture\" to regard the petitioner's untrue\n\nstatements to the police as reflective of consciousness of guilt.\n\nId.    The court explained that the petitioner \"might have made a\n\nfalse statement to law enforcement for any number of reasons,\n\nespecially given that any statements he made as a witness would\n\nlikely be used to prosecute his older brother, a member of his\n\nimmediate family.\"         Id.    The Juan H. court stressed:         \"Although we\n\nmust draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, a\n\n'reasonable' inference is one that is supported by a chain of\n\nlogic, rather than, as in this case, mere speculation dressed up in\n\nthe guise of evidence.\"           Id.\n\n                                          -42-\n\f            Finally, the Juan H. court stated that the prosecution's\n\nmotive     evidence      was    mere        conjecture,    reasoning      that   the\n\n\"interpersonal tensions\" between the petitioner and the victim \"do\n\nnot create a sufficiently strong inference of motive to allow a\n\nreasonable trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\n[the petitioner] had reason to aid and abet first-degree murder.\"\n\nId. at 1278.\n\n            The    Juan H. court maintained that \"[s]peculation and\n\nconjecture cannot take the place of reasonable inferences and\n\nevidence    --    whether      direct       or   circumstantial      --   that   [the\n\npetitioner] -- through both guilty mind and guilty act -- acted in\n\nconsort with [the principal].\"              Id. at 1279.    Applying the Jackson\n\nstandard to the state court decision, the Juan H. court ruled that\n\n\"only speculation . . . supports a conclusion\" that the petitioner\n\nwas guilty of aiding and abetting the first-degree murders.                      Id.\n\nIt   concluded    that    \"[s]uch       a    lack   of    evidence    violates    the\n\nFourteenth Amendment guarantee that an accused must go free unless\n\nand until the prosecution presents evidence that proves guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\"             Id. (citing In re Winship, 397 U.S.\n\n358, 365-68 (1970)).\n\n            Admittedly, the facts in Juan H. do not line up precisely\n\nwith those of the instant case.               However, we find instructive the\n\nJuan H. court's treatment of its consciousness of guilt evidence.25\n\n25\n   As we stated above, here the SJC viewed its consciousness of\nguilt evidence to be most probative of O'Laughlin's guilt.\n\n                                        -43-\n\fThe Juan H. court held that the petitioner's lies about his\n\npresence at the crime scene and the fact that he fled the area were\n\ninsufficient to support an inference that he aided and abetted the\n\nmurderer, reasoning that a conclusion regarding the petitioner's\n\nguilt from this evidence would be no more than \"bare conjecture.\"\n\n            The    evidence       in   Juan   H.   is   far     more   reflective    of\n\nconsciousness      of     guilt    than    what    we    have      here.   Unlike   the\n\npetitioner in Juan H., O'Laughlin was not caught in a lie about\n\nwhether he was present at the crime scene and did not flee the\n\nscene of the crime. In fact, O'Laughlin approached the police just\n\nminutes    after    the    attack.26       Similar      to   the    Juan   H.   court's\n\nreasoning, this consciousness of guilt evidence constituted \"bare\n\nconjecture\" regarding O'Laughlin's guilt and thus renders the SJC\n\ndecision   that     relied     primarily      on   this      evidence,     objectively\n\nunreasonable.\n\n            We     reiterate      that    Juan     H.   and     Newman,    while    not\n\ncontrolling, powerfully illustrate how federal courts, acting under\n\nthe AEDPA regime, can hold in appropriate circumstances state court\n\ndecisions to be objectively unreasonable when applying Jackson.\n\n\n\n26\n   As explained above, O'Laughlin's interactions with the police\nimmediately after the assault and the day after, while not\nirrelevant, did not constitute sufficient evidence for a rational\njury, even combined with the other circumstantial evidence, to\nconclude he was the assailant. Again, it may have been permissible\nfor the jury to find that O'Laughlin possessed consciousness of\nguilt of some crime, such as drug possession, for which the\nevidence showed there was some basis, but not of a vicious attack\non a neighbor with whom he had very little prior contact.\n\n                                          -44-\n\fOur sister courts' reasoning in these cases underscore why we\n\nbelieve habeas relief should be granted in the instant case.\n\n             Our holding is further bolstered by a post-AEDPA case of\n\nour own, Leftwich v. Maloney, where a petitioner claimed there to\n\nbe insufficient evidence for a state court to correctly identify\n\nhim as the perpetrator of the offense for which he was convicted.\n\nSee Leftwich, 532 F.3d at 21.          Although we held that habeas relief\n\nwas not warranted in Leftwich, it is helpful to consider the\n\nfactors we considered relevant.\n\n             In   Leftwich,    the     petitioner   argued      that   there     was\n\ninsufficient evidence to conclude that he was a principal rather\n\nthan an accessory to the murder of a bishop who had taken the\n\npetitioner in when he was released from prison.                 Id.    In holding\n\nthat there was sufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict, the\n\nLeftwich court considered that the petitioner confessed to being in\n\nthe   same   place,    a    ditch,    within   minutes   of    when    the   murder\n\noccurred;     that    the    police    recovered    from      the   petitioner    a\n\nLeatherman tool whose length and width were consistent with the\n\nvictim's wounds; that he \"embarked on a wide-ranging cleaning\n\nspree\" shortly before his arrest; that forensic evidence included\n\nfingerprint evidence and the victim's blood on the petitioner's\n\nclothes and hands; that the petitioner lied about having any\n\nknowledge of the victim's death; that the petitioner's motive\n\nresulted from the victim's disapproval of the petitioner's use of\n\ncompany credit card to satisfy a gambling debt; and that the\n\n                                        -45-\n\f\"record    [was]    barren     of   any     evidence      as    to    who    besides     the\n\npetitioner could have inflicted the fatal stab wounds.\" Id. at 25-\n\n27.\n\n            We note the many distinguishing features of the instant\n\ncase as compared to Leftwich.              Specifically, unlike the petitioner\n\nin Leftwich, there was no physical or forensic evidence linking\n\nO'Laughlin to the crime scene; O'Laughlin's financial motive was\n\ninconsistent with the evidence in Mrs. Kotowski's apartment; and\n\nO'Laughlin   presented       compelling          third-party     evidence        that   Mr.\n\nKotowski was the actual assailant.                We recognize that the stronger\n\nevidence    supporting       the    petitioner's        guilt    in       Leftwich,     when\n\ncompared to the present case, is not persuasive by itself to render\n\nthe evidence insufficient here. However, the fact that the instant\n\nfacts   satisfy     very     few    of     the    criteria      the       Leftwich    court\n\nconsidered relevant in its Jackson analysis, provides additional\n\nsupport    for    our   conclusion         here   that    the    SJC's       decision     to\n\nreinstate the conviction was objectively unreasonable.\n\n            We     acknowledge       the    many     strands         of    circumstantial\n\nevidence the prosecution has presented in this case; however, when\n\nviewing this evidence in its totality, as we must do on habeas\n\nreview,    that     evidence       is    far     from    sufficient         to   establish\n\nO'Laughlin's guilt under Jackson.                 Based on the record before us\n\nand drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution,\n\nwe hold that it would be overly speculative to conclude O'Laughlin\n\nto be the assailant beyond a reasonable doubt.                            Accordingly, we\n\n                                           -46-\n\fconclude that the SJC's decision to uphold O'Laughlin's conviction\n\nwas objectively unreasonable.\n\n                             III.    Conclusion\n\n            Because double jeopardy principles apply here, we remand\n\nto the district court to order O'Laughlin's unconditional release\n\nwith prejudice to reprosecution.        See Burks v. United States, 437\n\nU.S.   1,   18   (1978)   (holding   that   \"the   Double   Jeopardy   Clause\n\nprecludes a second trial once the reviewing court has found the\n\nevidence legally insufficient\"), quoted in Foxworth v. Maloney, 515\n\nF.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2008).27\n\n            Reversed and Remanded for action consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n27\n    O'Laughlin also claims that the SJC, in concluding that the\ntrial judge properly excluded a note O'Laughlin alleged to have\nsupported   his   third-party   culprit   defense,   violated   his\nconstitutional right to present a defense. In view of our holding\nregarding O'Laughlin's Jackson claim, we need not reach this issue.\n\n                                     -47-\n\f",

She survived, but could not remember the details surrounding the attack or the person who attacked her. After an investigation, police identified Petitioner-Appellant Michael O'Laughlin as the perpetrator.</p>\n<p>A Massachusetts Superior Court jury subsequently convicted O'Laughlin of the following counts: (1) burglary and armed assault in a dwelling; (2) armed assault in a dwelling; (3) armed assault with intent to murder; and (4) assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. The Superior Court then sentenced O'Laughlin to 35-50 years on Counts One and Two; 19-20 years on Count 3; and 9-10 years on Count 4, ruling that the sentences were to be served concurrently.

The district court denied O'Laughlin's petition for habeas relief.

Factual Summary</h2>\n<p>\"We must `accept the state court findings of fact unless [O'Laughlin] convinces us, by clear and convincing evidence, that they are in error.'\" <i>Lynch v. Ficco,</i> 438 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>McCambridge v. Hall,</i> 303 F.3d 24, 26 (1st Cir.2002) (en banc)); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1). We note that the SJC's findings of fact may be \"supplemented with other facts from the record that are consistent with the SJC's findings.\" <i>Lynch,</i> 438 F.3d at 39; <i>see also </i><i>Healy v. Spencer,</i> 453 F.3d 21, 22 (1st Cir.2006). Thus, we recount the facts largely as they were presented in the SJC's opinion.</p>\n<p>In May 2000, Mrs. Kotowski revealed to David Kotowski (\"Mr. Kotowski\"), her husband of over twenty-five years, that she was romantically involved with James Finn. In September 2000, Mrs. Kotowski moved out of her home into the Fox Hollow condominium complex in a neighboring town.<sup>[1]</sup> She resided alone. O'Laughlin, a member of Fox Hollow's maintenance staff, lived two doors down from Mrs. Kotowski. Like other members of the maintenance staff, he possessed a master key to all the buildings on the property, including a key to Mrs. Kotowski's apartment.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The SJC noted that O'Laughlin \"took some interest\" in Mrs. Kotowski prior to the attack. For example, when Mrs. Kotowski's sister was visiting, O'Laughlin stood outside her apartment and asked Mrs. Kotowski if there were \"any more good looking women in there[.]\" Also, he referred to Mrs. Kotowski five or six times in conversations with acquaintances, citing her \"beautiful antique furniture\" in her apartment as evidence of her wealth and remarking that he was attracted to her \"body type.\"<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The day before the attack, O'Laughlin cashed a $457.16 paycheck and made $200 child support payment to his ex-wife. Also, the SJC stated that O'Laughlin was agitated when he was unable to sell his trailer to his neighbor because the neighbor could not come up with $500. The neighbor paid him the next day.</p>\n<p>On the night of the attack, the SJC described O'Laughlin as \"[n]ervous, jittery, [and] paranoid....\" This was \"typical behavior when he smoked crack cocaine,\" which O'Laughlin had done earlier <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> that evening at the home of a friend, Mark Puleri.</p>\n<p>As the night wore on, O'Laughlin was \"depleted of drugs and most of his cash.\" At 9:00 or 9:30 p.m. that evening, O'Laughlin, now at home alone, telephoned another friend, Grover Finkle, asking him for a ride to purchase drugs. Finkle, who was at Richard O'Leary's house, had previously smoked crack cocaine with O'Laughlin and knew a drug dealer. Finkle and O'Leary, a taxicab driver, arrived at O'Laughlin's apartment an hour later. However, they soon left without giving O'Laughlin a ride because O'Laughlin was unable to secure money for cab fare.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In the early morning hours of November 17, between 12:10 and 1:43 a.m., fourteen telephone calls were placed to or from O'Laughlin's apartment. The majority of these calls were placed to known drug dealers.</p>\n<p>Shortly before 2:00 a.m. George Whittemore, a neighbor living directly above Mrs. Kotowski, awakened to a woman screaming directly below and the sound of \"wood hitting wood.\" According to Whittemore, a carpenter by profession, these sounds lasted for about thirty seconds.</p>\n<p>Whittemore dialed 911 at 1:55 a.m. He stayed awake until the police arrived and flashed his apartment lights to indicate his apartment to the police. Between the time he called 911 and when the police arrived, Whittemore did not hear any vehicles arrive or depart from the area. The police later conducted a reenactment of the 911 call. Based on this reenactment, they concluded that a person standing in Mrs. Kotowski's bedroom could have heard Whittemore's footsteps as he walked to the telephone as well as Whittemore's voice, but would have been unable to make out what was being said.</p>\n<p>Officers William Tierney and Phillip Skowron arrived six or seven minutes after Whittemore's 911 call. They were unable to find apartment number 202, the apartment reported in the dispatch, because the apartment numbers at the complex had been recently renumbered. They did not note anything unusual, but observed O'Laughlin walking from the building on a walkway leading from apartment number 19. O'Laughlin was wearing only boxer shorts and Officer Tierney testified that O'Laughlin appeared \"impervious\" to the near-freezing temperature.</p>\n<p>O'Laughlin questioned the officers regarding what had happened and the officers answered that they were responding to a report of a woman screaming. When they asked him if he had heard any screaming, O'Laughlin replied that he had been awakened by screaming, but believed it to be a raccoon trapped in a dumpster.<sup>[5]</sup> O'Laughlin explained that he had placed a stick in the dumpster so that it could escape. Officer Tierney then looked inside the dumpster and saw a stick, but no animal. The SJC noted that during his conversation with the officers, O'Laughlin seemed \"uneasy and distant,\" not making eye contact with them. The police further searched the area, but left after finding nothing suspicious.</p>\n<p>Whittemore testified that throughout the night he heard a woman moaning and crying directly below him.<sup>[6]</sup> He also testified that later in the morning, he heard the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> sound of glass breaking, banging, and a man outside Mrs. Kotowski's apartment calling her name. The man subsequently yelled \"Oh, my God.\"</p>\n<p>The man Whittemore was referring to was Mrs. Kotowski's boyfriend, Finn, who had arrived at 5:45 a.m. at Mrs. Kotowski's apartment. On weekdays, Finn routinely joined Mrs. Kotowski for a morning coffee prior to starting his workday. On this particular morning, when Finn knocked on the door, he only heard her say, \"Who is it?\" in a strange voice. After failing to reach her from a nearby public telephone, Finn testified that he forced open a locked sliding glass rear door. Although the living room appeared to be in order, he found Mrs. Kotowski lying on the floor next to the bed. He testified that \"there was just blood everywhere.\" Finn dialed 911 just before 6:30 a.m. Mrs. Kotowski, who had severe wounds on her head, was taken to Berkshire Medical Center. The police ruled out Finn as a suspect because of his alibi (which they confirmed), his reaction of shock upon discovering Mrs. Kotowski, and his cooperation with the police.</p>\n<p>Officers who arrived after Finn's 911 call observed blood in the victim's bedroom on the bed, the pillow, the floors, the walls, and on the door jambs of the bathroom and bedroom. The SJC noted that the crime scene contained \"`quite a bit of blood' that appeared to be `splatters' on the comforter.\" Further, the bed rail was dented, with wood splinters on the ground beneath the dent. Officer Skowron testified that everything else was intact as the apartment was neat and nothing was displaced. Mrs. Kotowski's purse was on the floor, however. Officer Skowron also testified that there were no signs that the front door or the rear sliding door had been forced open (which contradicted a report by an earlier officer on the scene stating that the rear door was broken); that the drawers were closed; and that the light and figurines on the dresser were upright. Mrs. Kotowski testified that no items of value were missing from the apartment. These items, which were in plain view on top of the dresser, included diamonds, pearls, and an expensive watch in the bedroom. Also, Mrs. Kotowski's purse contained her credit cards, about $28 in cash, and a checkbook. There was $522 in cash in a dresser drawer.</p>\n<p>Constance Cappel, a neighbor who lived in the apartment between O'Laughlin and Mrs. Kotowski, testified that she heard voices outside Mrs. Kotowski's apartment at about 6:45 a.m. Cappel went outside and saw Mrs. Kotowski being loaded into an ambulance. She knocked on O'Laughlin's door and told him that she thought someone had been murdered. O'Laughlin, who answered the door in his boxer shorts and looked like he had just awoken, responded \"What do you want me to do about it?\"</p>\n<p>At 8:45 a.m. O'Laughlin came out of his apartment dressed for work, approached one of his co-workers and Cappel, and inquired about what was happening. After his co-worker explained the situation, O'Laughlin described his encounter with the police the previous night and how he had been awakened by the police cruisers. O'Laughlin also informed his co-worker that he told the police that he thought raccoons had been in the dumpster making a \"kind of squealing sound.\"</p>\n<p>At about 9:40 a.m., Officers Tierney and Todd Briggs talked with O'Laughlin outside the apartment building and Officer Tierney noticed a \"scratch or a dig mark in [O'Laughlin's] left cheek, [a] small cut on his chin and a round, circular bruise ... just below his left ear.\" Officer Tierney was unsure about how fresh these marks were.</p>\n<p>The SJC remarked that although O'Laughlin was initially \"reluctant,\" he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> agreed to give a statement at the police station when informed that Officer Tierney would conduct the interview. O'Laughlin arrived at the station at 10:40 a.m., but was told by Chief Ronald Glidden to wait for Officer Tierney, who had yet to arrive. Officer Tierney arrived twenty minutes later and told O'Laughlin that he would be \"right with him.\" However, when he returned five minutes later, O'Laughlin had left.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>O'Laughlin returned to the police station twenty minutes later and was interviewed by Chief Glidden for about ten minutes. Chief Glidden testified that O'Laughlin \"seemed agitated\" during the interview. In his statement to Chief Glidden, O'Laughlin stated that he had been \"drinking before he went to bed and he just didn't think he was awake until he heard the cruisers at approximately two o'clock.\" He thought he may have heard foxes or raccoons before that, but was uncertain. O'Laughlin said that he had \"seen [the victim] around,\"; that he and a friend had joked about her boyfriend; and that he had been in that apartment to repair a window. After the interview concluded, he went home.</p>\n<p>State Troopers David Buell and Brian Berkel arrived at the complex around noon. Trooper Buell spoke to O'Laughlin, who stated that he had been out with his friend, Puleri, the previous night, returned at 10:30 p.m., went to sleep around 11:30 p.m., and was awakened by screaming, which he thought was a fox fighting with a raccoon. O'Laughlin said that a short time later the police arrived and he went out to speak with them. After the officers left, he slept until 7:30 a.m., when he was awakened by his neighbor, who had informed him that there had been a murder.</p>\n<p>Trooper Buell asked O'Laughlin for consent to search his apartment in order to eliminate him as a suspect and because his apartment was in close proximity to Mrs. Kotowski's apartment. O'Laughlin consented, and allowed Trooper Berkel to take photographs and two police chemists to search for blood stains. Trooper Berkel photographed a red stain on a closet door near the kitchen area. A chemist who saw the stain asked O'Laughlin if his consent included taking swabbings. O'Laughlin responded that it did not. Soon thereafter, O'Laughlin asked the officers to leave his apartment.</p>\n<p>Outside the apartment, the police decided to apply for a search warrant. They returned to O'Laughlin's apartment and informed him of their intent to secure the apartment and obtain a warrant. O'Laughlin replied that they did not need to pursue a warrant because he would allow them back into the apartment. He also told the officers that he had wiped the red stain off the closet door with his finger, and thought it was his own blood, but was not certain. O'Laughlin told the police that he was concerned about a search because he was afraid police would find his drug paraphernalia and because he possessed money that he did not want taken. Trooper Buell asked O'Laughlin to give him the drug paraphernalia, telling him that he would not be charged with drug possession.</p>\n<p>When the chemists returned to the apartment, the red stain on the closet door was gone. However, the area, where the stain had been, tested positive for the presumptive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> presence of blood. The chemists collected a sample by swabbing.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>A state trooper searched the area surrounding the apartment complex with a dog trained to search by scent. The dog found an aluminum bat about twenty-five yards away from a building's dumpster in the woods. It appeared to be covered in leaves and debris, but was otherwise clean. O'Laughlin's name was inscribed on the bat.</p>\n<p>On November 20, O'Laughlin called a friend and informed him that he was a suspect in the assault. The SJC noted that O'Laughlin was \"upset\" while he told his friend that he was \"very happy that [Mrs. Kotowski] had survived ... [s]o that she could identify her assailant,\" but with his bad luck the assailant could have been wearing a \"Nixon mask\" and entered with a baseball bat.</p>\n<p>Later that day O'Laughlin was arrested. While in custody, O'Laughlin told an inmate that although he owned the bat, he last saw it when he moved into his apartment.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>The police recovered fourteen fingerprints and one palm print from Mrs. Kotowski's apartment, none of which matched those of O'Laughlin.<sup>[10]</sup> In addition, footprint impressions taken at the apartment did not match O'Laughlin's boots. State Police Lieutenant Brian O'Hara, trained in fingerprint analysis and bloodstain patterns, opined that a blood stain on Mrs. Kotowski's pillow was caused by the transfer of blood from a person's right hand, but the handprint was unidentifiable. He testified that the hand had to have had a significant amount of blood on it, not all of which would have been transferred.</p>\n<p>A state police chemist examined the aluminum bat found in the woods. Three small reddish brown stains on the bat tested positive for the presumptive presence of blood, only one of which tested positive for human blood. The three stains were swabbed and sent to the DNA unit for further testing. There was contamination in the DNA lab, and thus the tests consumed all the testable material without yielding results. An additional cutting from tape on the bat's handle, an area where the presumptive presence of blood could still be detected, was submitted to the laboratory. A state police DNA analyst concluded that while Mrs. Kotowski could not be excluded as a contributor, one in two of any randomly selected individuals could have been the contributor.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>A surgeon who performed reconstructive surgeries on Mrs. Kotowski after the attack testified that she had sustained between fifteen to twenty blows that broke <span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> nearly every bone in her face and skull. The only exception was her jaw. She also had defensive wounds on her hands caused by five to ten blows. The surgeon gave an opinion that Mrs. Kotowski's injuries were caused by a long, sturdy, hard, round object, consistent with an aluminum bat that was recovered in the woods on the day of the attack.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural History</h2>\n<p>In December 2000, A Berkshire County grand jury charged O'Laughlin with four offenses: (1) burglary and armed assault in a dwelling, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, § 14; (2) armed assault in a dwelling, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 18A; (3) armed assault with intent to murder, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 18(b); and (4) assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 15A(b).</p>\n<p>Following a nine-day jury trial in May 2002, O'Laughlin was convicted of all four charges. O'Laughlin appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The Massachusetts Appeals Court Opinion</h2>\n<p>On appeal, the Massachusetts Appeals Court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdicts. The Appeals Court stated that while the government's evidence demonstrated that O'Laughlin had a motive of robbery, an opportunity to commit the crime, a means to commit the crime, and a consciousness of guilt, the evidence was not enough to establish guilt. The Appeals Court concluded that \"[n]othing in the record sufficiently links the defendant to the crime to permit the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the perpetrator\" and that \"[p]iling inference upon inference does not amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>O'Laughlin I,</i> 830 N.E.2d at 231-32. In reaching its conclusion, the Appeals Court noted that the bat was only \"consistent\" with the weapon used in the attack; that O'Laughlin's lies to the police concerning his whereabouts and his removal of the stain from his closet door, \"while certainly permissible to show a guilty conscience, cannot fill the gap in the proof of identity\"; that O'Laughlin did not show physical strain in his appearance and demeanor when confronted by the police just about twelve minutes after the attack, which would have been consistent with someone who had just committed such a \"brutal\" attack; and that the third-party culprit evidence in this case detracted from the government's case. <i>Id.</i> at 232-34. Thus, the Appeals Court reversed O'Laughlin's convictions and directed that judgments be entered in his favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The SJC Opinion</h2>\n<p>The Commonwealth then sought and received further appellate review from the SJC. The SJC concluded that the evidence against O'Laughlin had been sufficient and affirmed his convictions, stating that circumstantial evidence of motive, opportunity, means, and consciousness of guilt \"permissibly convinced the jury of the defendant's guilt.\" <i>O'Laughlin II,</i> 843 N.E.2d at 627.</p>\n<p>The SJC stated that the jury could permissibly find that O'Laughlin's motive to break into Mrs. Kotowski's apartment was robbery. <i>Id.</i> It pointed to the fact that O'Laughlin had taken drugs twice previously on the night of November 16, had \"run out\" of drugs and money, and was calling around as late as 1:43 a.m. to purchase drugs, which the SJC noted was \"only twelve minutes before the victims' upstairs neighbor telephoned the police department to report screams and banging sounds from downstairs.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The SJC further noted that O'Laughlin had previously entered the victim's apartment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*296</span> and \"had reason to believe that she was wealthy and might have cash or valuables.\" <i>Id.</i> The SJC commented that O'Laughlin \"needed money immediately and the victim was a nearby and likely source.\" <i>Id.</i> Accounting for the fact that nothing was taken from the apartment, the SJC pointed to a reenactment during trial demonstrating that the neighbor could be heard in the apartment below when he called the police. The SJC concluded that \"[i]t is a reasonable inference that the defendant was frightened off before he could steal anything when he heard the neighbor speaking.\" <i>Id.</i> at 627 n. 11.</p>\n<p>The SJC also concluded that O'Laughlin had the opportunity to commit the crime because he resided only two apartment doors away from Mrs. Kotowski and that he had a master key which gave him access to her apartment. <i>Id.</i> at 627. In addition, the SJC pointed to Whittemore's testimony that he did not hear any cars going to or from the apartment complex in the interval between when he first heard the screaming and when the police arrived. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The SJC also reasoned that O'Laughlin had the means to commit the crime by stating that the aluminum bat was found a short distance from Mrs. Kotowski's apartment complex. <i>Id.</i> The SJC stated that \"[t]he jury would certainly be warranted in concluding that the bat was the defendant's.\" <i>Id.</i> The SJC explained that \"[h]is surname, not a common one, was visible on the bat handle and he mentioned to someone in jail that he was the owner of the bat the police had found.\" <i>Id.</i> The SJC further noted, however, that although the bat was covered by some leaves and debris, it was otherwise \"clean\" when discovered. <i>Id.</i> It also acknowledged O'Laughlin's statement that he had not seen the bat since the day he had moved into his apartment. <i>Id.</i> at 627 n. 12.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the SJC indicated the significant evidence pointing to O'Laughlin's consciousness of guilt. <i>Id.</i> at 627. First, the SJC referenced O'Laughlin's demeanor when the police first arrived on the scene and discovered O'Laughlin outside in his \"boxer shorts in near freezing temperature.\" <i>Id.</i> The SJC noted that when he talked with the police, he was \"uneasy and distant\" and did not make eye contact with the police officers. <i>Id.</i> Also, the SJC remarked that the differing versions O'Laughlin gave to police as to the reason he woke up was indicative of his untruthfulness.<sup>[12]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 627-28. The SJC further noted that O'Laughlin reluctantly participated in an interview with the police and seemed \"agitated\" when he spoke with them. <i>Id.</i> at 628.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the SJC pointed to O'Laughlin's reaction to the police's request when they asked for a swabbing of the red stain in the closet door of his apartment. <i>Id.</i> Although O'Laughlin later allowed the police to return, the stain was gone and O'Laughlin admitted to having removed it with his finger, saying that he believed that it was his own blood. The SJC concluded that \"[t]his evidence reflected not merely a general consciousness of guilt, but indicated that the defendant feared that the blood stain could be that of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*297</span> victim, a fear he would have only if he were in fact the perpetrator.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, the SJC pointed to the fact that O'Laughlin had \"a `scratch or dig mark' on his cheek, a small cut on his chin and a bruise on his neck.\" <i>Id.</i> While acknowledging that the police officer could not discern whether the marks were \"fresh,\" the SJC concluded that \"it could be inferred that the injuries were sustained during a physical encounter with the victim.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In sum, the SJC stated that the evidence taken together \"was sufficient to permit the jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the perpetrator of the vicious attack on the victim.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In reversing the lower appellate court decision, the SJC distinguished its case law in <i>Commonwealth v. Mazza,</i> 399 Mass. 395, 504 N.E.2d 630 (1987), stating that in the instant case the prosecution \"presented more evidence linking [O'Laughlin] to the assault.\" <i>O'Laughlin II,</i> 843 N.E.2d at 629. Furthermore, the instant case contained evidence of means as represented by the aluminum bat, \"significantly stronger evidence of consciousness of guilt,\" bruises on O'Laughlin's face, and the fact that O'Laughlin was wearing only boxers when the police found him, which \"would be consistent with his having disposed of bloody outer garments.\" <i>Id.</i> With respect to O'Laughlin's attire, the SJC added that \"[t]he jury could find that, had the defendant gone outside to check for animals in the dumpster (as he claimed), it was implausible that he would have done so without putting on at least minimal clothing, not only for purposes of protection against the cold but also for purposes of decency.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The SJC disagreed with the weight placed by the Appeals Court on the fact that O'Laughlin \"did not manifest any signs of recent physical exertion (sweat, shortness of breath, wet hair or disarray)\" twelve minutes after the attack. <i>Id.</i> at 629 n. 13. The SJC stated that this did not detract from the government's case because twelve minutes after the attack there would be no reason for O'Laughlin to show signs of this physical exertion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Also, the SJC disagreed with the Appeals Court that the third-party culprit evidence presented in this case detracted from the government's argument or affected the sufficiency of the evidence because it was not \"so overwhelming that no rational jury could conclude that the defendant was guilty.\" <i>Id.</i> at 630. The SJC stated that the third-party culprit evidence \"simply tended to contradict the Commonwealth's evidence; it did not show it to be incredible or conclusively incorrect.\"<sup>[13]</sup><i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*298</span> 3. O'Laughlin's Habeas Petition</h2>\n<p>In his habeas petition before the district court, O'Laughlin alleged that (1) the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove that he was a perpetrator of the offenses for which he was convicted; and (2) the trial court violated his right to present a defense by excluding a handwritten note that, according to O'Laughlin, supported his third-party culprit defense. After briefing by the parties and a non-evidentiary hearing, the district court denied O'Laughlin's petition reasoning that \"like the courts that have looked at this cold record before me, this is a close question. But the petition must be under federal law denied.\"</p>\n<p>O'Laughlin then filed a timely notice of appeal and requested a Certificate of Appealability (\"COA\") as to his sufficiency and right-to-present a defense claims. The district court granted a COA with respect to both issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review <i>de novo</i> the district court's decision to grant or deny a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2254. <i>Healy,</i> 453 F.3d at 25. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), Pub.L. No. 104-132, § 104, 110 Stat. 1214, 1219 (1996), a federal court shall not grant a petition for habeas relief \"with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\" unless the state court decision: 1) \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\" or 2) \"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1)-(2). \"A state court's findings on factual issues `shall be presumed to be correct' and the petitioner bears the burden of disproving factual findings by `clear and convincing evidence.'\" <i>McCambridge,</i> 303 F.3d at 34-35 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1)).</p>\n<p>Sufficiency claims are generally<sup>[14]</sup> evaluated under § 2254(d)(1) and we look to \"whether the state court decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court case law.\" <i>Hurtado v. Tucker,</i> 245 F.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Williams v. Matesanz,</i> 230 F.3d 421, 426 (1st Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*299</span> \"[T]he `unreasonable application of' prong of § 2254(d)(1) `reduces to a question of whether the state court's derivation of a case-specific rule from the [Supreme] Court's generally relevant jurisprudence appears objectively reasonable.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 16 (quoting <i>Matesanz,</i> 230 F.3d at 425).</p>\n<p>\"Habeas review involves the layering of two standards. The habeas question of whether the state court decision is objectively unreasonable is layered on top of the underlying standard governing the constitutional right asserted.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The constitutional right asserted in sufficiency of the evidence claims is set forth by the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Jackson v. Virginia,</i> 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Under <i>Jackson,</i> due process requires that \"no person shall be made to suffer the onus of a criminal conviction except upon sufficient proof-defined as evidence necessary to convince a trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of every element of the offense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 316, 99 S.Ct. 2781. More succinctly, the relevant test we take from <i>Jackson</i> is \"whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <i>any</i> rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.</i> at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>Thus, for our purposes, we must decide whether the SJC's application of <i>Jackson</i> to O'Laughlin's case was \"objectively unreasonable.\" Although \"[t]he term `unreasonable' is no doubt difficult to define,\" <i>Hurtado,</i> 245 F.3d at 17 (quoting <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 410, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)), we have explained that \"some increment of incorrectness beyond error is required.\" <i>McCambridge,</i> 303 F.3d at 36 (quoting <i>Francis S. v. Stone,</i> 221 F.3d 100, 111 (2d Cir.2000)). \"The increment need not necessarily be great, but it must be great enough to make the decision unreasonable in the independent and objective judgment of the federal court.\" <i>Id.</i><sup>[15]</sup> To be sure, \"the gap between erroneous state court decisions and unreasonable ones is narrow,\" <i>Evans v. Thompson,</i> 518 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2008), and \"it will be the rare case that will fall into this gap,\" <i>id.</i> (citing <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 388, 120 S.Ct. 1495). However, for an erroneous decision to be unreasonable, judicial incompetence is not necessary and \"a case will fall into this narrow gap precluding relief only when `it is a <i>close question</i> whether the state decision is in error.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 7 (quoting <i>McCambridge,</i> 303 F.3d at 36) (emphasis in original). \"`It is enough if the Supreme Court's general principles can be discerned and if, respectfully but with confidence,' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*300</span> the federal court concludes that the state court unreasonably applied federal law.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>White,</i> 399 F.3d at 25).</p>\n<p>Further, in our inquiry of objective unreasonableness the question \"is not how well reasoned the state court decision is, but whether the outcome is reasonable.\" <i>Hurtado,</i> 245 F.3d at 20. We note that just because an opinion is poorly reasoned does not \"mean that the outcome represents an unreasonable application, although ... it is certainly ground for further inquiry if the state court ignores material facts.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citation omitted). \"`It is not necessary that the federal court agree with every last detail of the state court's analysis. By like token, state courts are not required to supply the specific reasons that a federal court thinks are most persuasive for upholding the judgment.'\" <i>Healy,</i> 453 F.3d at 28-29 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Bui v. DiPaolo,</i> 170 F.3d 232, 243 (1st Cir. 1999)).</p>\n<p>As a final note, we emphasize the great degree of deference state court judgments are due, especially those that uphold jury verdicts.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Applicable Law</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The <i>Jackson</i> Standard</h2>\n<p>Turning to the underlying constitutional right asserted here, O'Laughlin maintains that his due process rights were violated because after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, no rational trier of fact could have identified him as the assailant beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See </i><i>Jackson,</i> 443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781 (\"whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <i>any</i> rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\") (emphasis in original); <i>United States v.

This is particularly the case where we have no eyewitness to identify the perpetrator. In cases based on circumstantial evidence such as the instant case,<sup>[17]</sup> \"we face head-on the disturbing truth that guilty verdicts rest on judgments about probabilities and those judgments are usually intuitive rather <span class=\"star-pagination\">*301</span> than scientific.\" <i>Stewart v.

Analysis of the SJC Opinion</h2>\n<p>As our sister court has noted, \"[a]lthough circumstantial evidence alone can support a conviction, there are times that it amounts to only a reasonable speculation and not to sufficient evidence.\" <i>Newman,</i> 543 F.3d at 796. This is such a case.</p>\n<p>The instant facts may support a reasonable speculation that O'Laughlin was the assailant, but not sufficient evidence to establish his guilt. Taken together, the circumstantial evidence in this case, even when drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, does not permit any rational jury to conclude that O'Laughlin was the assailant beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the evidence that O'Laughlin acted upon a financial motive to commit the attack is weak at best. A jury could permissibly conclude that he needed money to acquire crack cocaine, giving him reason to break into Mrs. Kotowski's apartment, a person whom he knew had money. However, Mrs. Kotowski testified that nothing of value was taken and no items, not even expensive jewelry in plain view, were disturbed. The SJC accounted for this fact by stating that the jury could draw \"a reasonable inference that the defendant was frightened off before he could steal anything when he heard the neighbor [Whittemore] speaking.\" <i>O'Laughlin II,</i> 843 N.E.2d at 627 n. 11. Even if the assailant deduced that the neighbor was calling the police in response to the attack,<sup>[18]</sup> no rational juror could conclude that the placement of this phone call frightened him off given the volume and duration of Mrs. Kotowski's screams. Moreover, the assailant's actions are inconsistent with O'Laughlin's purported financial motive in view of the savage beating Mrs. Kotowski suffered at the hands of the assailant, an attack involving at least fifteen to twenty blows that nearly broke every bone in her face and skull. If the assailant were motivated by money, a few blows to incapacitate her would have been sufficient.</p>\n<p>With respect to the opportunity to commit the crime, O'Laughlin had a master key and there were no signs of forced entry; thus, one possible inference is that O'Laughlin used his master key to enter Mrs. Kotowski's apartment. It is notable, however, that several others on the maintenance staff possessed a master key. Also, Mrs. Kotowski could have let someone familiar to her into the apartment.</p>\n<p>With respect to the means for the attack, a jury could permissibly find that the aluminum bat found in the woods was O'Laughlin's bat given that his name was on the bat and that he admitted to owning the bat at one time. Yet, there was little evidence connecting the aluminum bat, a non-unique item in a residential complex, to the crime scene apart from the fact that it was found twenty-five yards from the residential complex the following day and the use of such an object was \"consistent\" with Mrs. Kotowski's injuries.<sup>[19]</sup> Of course, any bat likely would have been consistent with her injuries. Also, Whittemore, a carpenter, testified that he heard \"wood hitting wood,\" as opposed to hearing the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*303</span> sound of a hollow aluminum bat, when he was awakened. Furthermore, wooden bats were found in Mrs. Kotowski's estranged husband's garage.</p>\n<p>We next turn to O'Laughlin's consciousness of guilt, which the SJC considered the strongest evidence in favor of reinstating the conviction.<sup>[20]</sup> When viewed in context, this evidence is minimally probative on the question of whether O'Laughlin was the assailant.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the fact that it was just after 2:00 a.m., the SJC cited to O'Laughlin's \"uneasy and distant\" demeanor and his unwillingness to look Officers Tierney and Skowron in the eye when they confronted him just minutes after the attack. However, both officers, even though they were responding to reports of a possible assault, did not consider O'Laughlin's behavior suspicious at the time. Indeed, they initially believed he was the reporting party and after asking him a few brief questions they left the area. Even the fact that O'Laughlin was only clad in boxers in near-freezing temperature did not give them pause after he explained to them that he was awakened by animal screams and had gone outside to place a stick in the dumpster, a fact Officer Tierney promptly verified. Also, the SJC explained that a jury could find it \"implausible\" that O'Laughlin would have gone outside without \"putting on at least minimal clothing\" if his true reason for going outside was to check for animals. Yet, Officer Tierney stated that O'Laughlin appeared unfazed by the cold and O'Laughlin's alibi shows that he did not intend to stay outside for a very long time.</p>\n<p>The other consciousness of guilt evidence cited by the SJC  O'Laughlin's reluctance to be interviewed by the police, the inconsistent versions of how he was awoken, his reaction to the neighbor's report of an assault, the fact that he was agitated during the interview, and his reaction when the police wanted to swab his closet door  while not helpful to his case, are not enough, even when considered in combination with other circumstantial evidence, to allow a jury to permissibly conclude O'Laughlin's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>With respect to this evidence, the fact that O'Laughlin was reluctant to come down to the police station and displayed some agitation during the interview has minimal probative value in determining whether O'Laughlin was the assailant. Although this behavior could indicate consciousness of guilt for some crime, such as possessing crack cocaine (which the evidence shows he admitted to being concerned about), it is an impermissible inferential leap for a jury to find this behavior significantly probative of whether O'Laughlin committed such a brutal attack.<sup>[21]</sup> Likewise, his indifferent reaction to his neighbor informing him of the attack the following morning may bear on whether he was a compassionate person, but has little probative value in assessing O'Laughlin's guilt.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*304</span> Admittedly, the conflicting versions O'Laughlin gave the police as to how he was awoken and his reaction to the police's request to swab his closet door when they were searching his home could be probative evidence linking O'Laughlin to the crime. However, in light of O'Laughlin's concerns that the police would discover his drug use, this evidence was insufficient to serve as the primary basis upon which the jury could rely to conclude O'Laughlin's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the SJC cited bruises and marks on O'Laughlin's face as evidence from which the jury could infer that an altercation occurred between O'Laughlin and Mrs. Kotowski. However, these bruises and marks have minimal, if any, probative force given the fact that they were not even noted by Officers Tierney and Skowron when they were responding to an assault just minutes after the attack.</p>\n<p>It bears repeating that the prosecution had to rely on circumstantial evidence because no physical or DNA evidence linked O'Laughlin to the attack despite the copious amount of blood at the crime scene. Considering the large amount of blood, it is difficult to fathom how O'Laughlin was able to avoid having any blood or other DNA evidence connect him to Mrs. Kotowski. Given the insufficiency of the evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, tying O'Laughlin to the attack, we conclude that a rational jury could not find O'Laughlin's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Objectively Unreasonable Standard for Purposes of Habeas Review</h2>\n<p>Although we have identified several gaps in the SJC's analysis, we are mindful that on habeas review under AEDPA we are not permitted to grant a writ if we merely disagree with the jury verdict or if we identify an error in the SJC's reasoning. The relevant inquiry is whether the SJC was objectively unreasonable in upholding the conviction.</p>\n<p>We once again acknowledge the extremely high bar that must be overcome on habeas review to overturn a state court decision; however, that bar is not insurmountable and on rare occasions we have held a state court decision to be objectively unreasonable. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>White,</i> 399 F.3d at 25 (holding on habeas review that state court unreasonably applied Supreme Court's Confrontation Clause jurisprudence where state court barred petitioner from cross examining complainants regarding prior accusations).</p>\n<p>This court has identified certain guidelines that it finds useful in analyzing sufficiency claims on habeas review.<sup>[22]</sup> In addition, we note that although we evaluate the state court decision in light of Supreme Court precedent, we are not precluded from looking at other federal court decisions that may help guide us in applying <span class=\"star-pagination\">*305</span> the <i>Jackson</i> standard. Indeed, \"`[d]ecisions from the lower federal courts may help inform the AEDPA analysis to the extent that they state the clearly established federal law determined by the Supreme Court.'\" <i>Evans,</i> 518 F.3d at 10 (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Aspen v. Bissonnette,</i> 480 F.3d 571, 574 n. 1 (1st Cir.2007)). This is especially true when \"`factually similar cases from the lower federal courts' can `provid[e] a valuable reference point' when considering the reasonableness of a state court's application of Supreme Court precedent to a particular set of facts.\" <i>Id.</i> (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Rashad v. Walsh,</i> 300 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir.2002)). Under § 2254(d)(1), we are not constrained in our \"ability to draw from any legal source in determining whether the state court's decision rests on constitutional error or is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. [Section 2254(d)(1)] only limits the grounds on which habeas relief may be granted.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>With this in mind, we look to a recent case, <i>Newman v. Metrish</i><i>,</i> where the Sixth Circuit held a state court ruling to be objectively unreasonable on grounds that the prosecution did not present sufficient evidence to support a prosecution for murder of a known drug dealer. 543 F.3d at 797. In <i>Newman,</i> the prosecution presented evidence at trial that the petitioner planned to rob drug dealers for drugs or money; that the victim was a known drug dealer who kept drugs in his freezer; that the petitioner and the victim were known to engage in drug transactions in the past; that the victim's freezer was \"open and empty\" after he was killed; and that the petitioner had a motive for the killing because he had seen the victim \"make a pass\" at the petitioner's girlfriend. <i>Id.</i> at 794. Furthermore, the prosecution presented evidence supporting an inference that Newman had possessed and once purchased the murder weapon. <i>Id.</i> This evidence included forensic evidence and the fact that the petitioner's friend saw a gun similar to the murder weapon in the petitioner's home a few weeks prior to the murder.<sup>[23]</sup><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In analyzing the evidence under <i>Jackson,</i> the <i>Newman</i> court stated that even when \"consider[ing] all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, there remains reasonable doubt because we are limited by what inferences reason will allow us to draw.\" <i>Id.</i> at 797. It remarked that these limitations included its ability to \"infer only that [the petitioner] intended to rob a drug dealer and knew that [the victim] was a drug dealer, that a gun previously owned by [the petitioner] was used to kill [the victim], and that a similar looking gun was seen in [the petitioner's] home approximately two weeks before the murder.\" <i>Id.</i> The <i>Newman</i> court added that \"even assuming that [the petitioner's] gun was indeed the one used in the homicide, there was no evidence of what happened to it between that date and the date of the homicide, and we need not speculate as to what might have happened.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The <i>Newman</i> court reasoned that while there was \"a wealth of information showing that [the petitioner] owned the gun,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*306</span> \"evidence placing [the petitioner] at the scene\" was \"conspicuously absent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 797. It pointed to the fact that there was no eyewitness testimony and the police did not recover any fingerprints from the crime scene. <i>Id.</i> The <i>Newman</i> court stated that \"[w]ithout additional evidence placing [him] at the scene of the crime, there is only a reasonable speculation that [the petitioner] himself was present.\" <i>Id.</i> It concluded that \"where the evidence taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution creates only a reasonable speculation that a defendant was present at the crime, there is insufficient evidence to satisfy the <i>Jackson</i> standard.\" <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, the <i>Newman</i> court declared the state court ruling an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>While <i>Newman</i>'s reasoning certainly does not control our analysis, it is significant that our sister court ruled a state court decision to be objectively unreasonable under <i>Jackson</i> on facts more probative of a petitioner's guilt than what we have here. For example, O'Laughlin, like the petitioner in <i>Newman,</i> was not connected to the crime scene by forensic evidence or eyewitness testimony; however, unlike the petitioner in <i>Newman</i> who had prior business dealings with the victim in that case, O'Laughlin had minimal contact with the victim apart from a few casual conversations and a maintenance call. Moreover, the petitioner's robbery motive in <i>Newman</i> was consistent with the evidence  as the victim's freezer, which was his storage place for drugs, was open and empty.<sup>[24]</sup> In the instant case, however, O'Laughlin's alleged motive of robbery to satisfy his need for crack cocaine does not align with the fact that nothing of value was taken from Mrs. Kotowski's apartment or with how savagely she was beaten at the hands of her assailant. Lastly, in <i>Newman,</i> the petitioner owned a gun whose spent cartridges and bullets matched those found in the victim's body. Here, the aluminum baseball bat that O'Laughlin owned was merely \"consistent\" with Mrs. Kotowski's injuries, in the same way a metal pipe or some other long, sturdy object would be consistent with her injuries.</p>\n<p>Another decision from a sister court also informs our analysis as to whether the SJC unreasonably applied the <i>Jackson</i> standard. In <i>Juan H. v. Allen</i><i>,</i> the Ninth Circuit held that the state court decision was objectively unreasonable because there was insufficient evidence to conclude that a juvenile petitioner aided and abetted a principal in committing first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder. 408 F.3d at 1278-79.</p>\n<p>In <i>Juan H.,</i> the state court had concluded that the petitioner had \"manifested consciousness of guilt\" because he `fled from the crime scene; he attempted to leave his home with his family after the shooting; and he gave a false alibi to the police that he was in a trailer and not present during the shooting. <i>Id.</i> at 1277. Also, as motive evidence, the state court cited petitioner's gang gestures towards the victim and the fact that the petitioner had punched the victim on a prior occasion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>With respect to the evidence of flight, the <i>Juan H.</i> court reasoned that \"[n]o reasonable trier of fact could find evidence of criminal culpability in the decision of a teenager to run home from the scene of a shooting, regardless of whether the home was in the same general direction as the car of a fleeing suspect.\" <i>Id.</i> The <i>Juan H.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*307</span> court added that \"[l]ikewise, any rational factfinder would find little or no evidence of guilt in the fact that [the petitioner] attempted, along with the rest of his family, to leave his home as it was being surrounded by an angry mob of neighbors.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Regarding the false alibi, the <i>Juan H.</i> court remarked that it was \"bare conjecture\" to regard the petitioner's untrue statements to the police as reflective of consciousness of guilt. <i>Id.</i> The court explained that the petitioner \"might have made a false statement to law enforcement for any number of reasons, especially given that any statements he made as a witness would likely be used to prosecute his older brother, a member of his immediate family.\" <i>Id.</i> The <i>Juan H.</i> court stressed: \"Although we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, a `reasonable' inference is one that is supported by a chain of logic, rather than, as in this case, mere speculation dressed up in the guise of evidence.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, the <i>Juan H.</i> court stated that the prosecution's motive evidence was mere conjecture, reasoning that the \"interpersonal tensions\" between the petitioner and the victim \"do not create a sufficiently strong inference of motive to allow a reasonable trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that [the petitioner] had reason to aid and abet first-degree murder.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1278.</p>\n<p>The <i>Juan H.</i> court maintained that \"[s]peculation and conjecture cannot take the place of reasonable inferences and evidence  whether direct or circumstantial  that [the petitioner]  through both guilty mind and guilty act  acted in consort with [the principal].\" <i>Id.</i> at 1279. Applying the <i>Jackson</i> standard to the state court decision, the <i>Juan H.</i> court ruled that \"only speculation ... supports a conclusion\" that the petitioner was guilty of aiding and abetting the first-degree murders. <i>Id.</i> It concluded that \"[s]uch a lack of evidence violates the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee that an accused must go free unless and until the prosecution presents evidence that proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>In re Winship,</i> 397 U.S. 358, 365-68, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970)).</p>\n<p>Admittedly, the facts in <i>Juan H.</i> do not line up precisely with those of the instant case. However, we find instructive the <i>Juan H.</i> court's treatment of its consciousness of guilt evidence.<sup>[25]</sup> The <i>Juan H.</i> court held that the petitioner's lies about his presence at the crime scene and the fact that he fled the area were insufficient to support an inference that he aided and abetted the murderer, reasoning that a conclusion regarding the petitioner's guilt from this evidence would be no more than \"bare conjecture.\"</p>\n<p>The evidence in <i>Juan H.</i> is far more reflective of consciousness of guilt than what we have here. Unlike the petitioner in <i>Juan H.,</i> O'Laughlin was not caught in a lie about whether he was present at the crime scene and did not flee the scene of the crime. In fact, O'Laughlin approached the police just minutes after the attack.<sup>[26]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*308</span> Similar to the <i>Juan H.</i> court's reasoning, this consciousness of guilt evidence constituted \"bare conjecture\" regarding O'Laughlin's guilt and thus renders the SJC decision that relied primarily on this evidence, objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p>We reiterate that <i>Juan H.</i> and <i>Newman,</i> while not controlling, powerfully illustrate how federal courts, acting under the AEDPA regime, can hold in appropriate circumstances state court decisions to be objectively unreasonable when applying <i>Jackson.</i> Our sister courts' reasoning in these cases underscore why we believe habeas relief should be granted in the instant case.</p>\n<p>Our holding is further bolstered by a post-AEDPA case of our own, <i>Leftwich v. Maloney</i><i>,</i> where a petitioner claimed there to be insufficient evidence for a state court to correctly identify him as the perpetrator of the offense for which he was convicted. <i>See </i><i>Leftwich,</i> 532 F.3d at 21. Although we held that habeas relief was not warranted in <i>Leftwich,</i> it is helpful to consider the factors we considered relevant.</p>\n<p>In <i>Leftwich,</i> the petitioner argued that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that he was a principal rather than an accessory to the murder of a bishop who had taken the petitioner in when he was released from prison. <i>Id.</i> In holding that there was sufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict, the <i>Leftwich</i> court considered that the petitioner confessed to being in the same place, a ditch, within minutes of when the murder occurred; that the police recovered from the petitioner a Leatherman tool whose length and width were consistent with the victim's wounds; that he \"embarked on a wide-ranging cleaning spree\" shortly before his arrest; that forensic evidence included fingerprint evidence and the victim's blood on the petitioner's clothes and hands; that the petitioner lied about having any knowledge of the victim's death; that the petitioner's motive resulted from the victim's disapproval of the petitioner's use of company credit card to satisfy a gambling debt; and that the \"record [was] barren of any evidence as to who besides the petitioner could have inflicted the fatal stab wounds.\" <i>Id.</i> at 25-27.</p>\n<p>We note the many distinguishing features of the instant case as compared to <i>Leftwich.</i> Specifically, unlike the petitioner in <i>Leftwich,</i> there was no physical or forensic evidence linking O'Laughlin to the crime scene; O'Laughlin's financial motive was inconsistent with the evidence in Mrs. Kotowski's apartment; and O'Laughlin presented compelling third-party evidence that Mr. Kotowski was the actual assailant. We recognize that the stronger evidence supporting the petitioner's guilt in <i>Leftwich,</i> when compared to the present case, is not persuasive by itself to render the evidence insufficient here. However, the fact that the instant facts satisfy very few of the criteria the <i>Leftwich</i> court considered relevant in its <i>Jackson</i> analysis, provides additional support for our conclusion here that the SJC's decision to reinstate the conviction was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge the many strands of circumstantial evidence the prosecution has presented in this case; however, when viewing this evidence in its totality, as we must do on habeas review, that evidence is far from sufficient to establish O'Laughlin's guilt under <i>Jackson.</i> Based on the record before us and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, we hold that it would be overly speculative to conclude O'Laughlin to be the assailant beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we conclude that the SJC's decision to uphold O'Laughlin's conviction was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*309</span> III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because double jeopardy principles apply here, we remand to the district court to order O'Laughlin's unconditional release with prejudice to reprosecution. <i>See </i><i>Burks v. United States,</i> 437 U.S. 1, 18, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978) (holding that \"the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a second trial once the reviewing court has found the evidence legally insufficient\"), quoted in <i>Foxworth v. Maloney,</i> 515 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.2008).<sup>[27]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Reversed and Remanded for action consistent with this opinion.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The SJC indicated a \"difficult\" marital situation: \"Both the victim and her husband characterized their relationship as friendly but strained. (Other witnesses described the husband's attitude as alternating between loving and angry.)\" Approximately a week before the attack, she conversed for the first time with her husband about the possibility of getting a divorce. Mrs. Kotowski testified that Mr. Kotowski was \"crushed\" by the move.</p>\n<p>[2]  O'Laughlin had been inside Mrs. Kotowski's apartment at least once previously in September to fix a window, among other tasks.</p>\n<p>[3]  In addition, the SJC states that just days before the attack, one acquaintance testified that O'Laughlin had \"really scared\" Mrs. Kotowski by inquiring \"about the window in her apartment.\" However, once Mrs. Kotowski realized he was on the maintenance staff, she simply walked away.</p>\n<p>[4]  O'Leary refused to drive unless O'Laughlin provided him with an advance payment.</p>\n<p>[5]  O'Laughlin's supervisor testified that the complex had been having problems with raccoons getting caught in the dumpster.</p>\n<p>[6]  Although he heard these sounds, Whittemore did not contact the police again that night.</p>\n<p>[7]  O'Laughlin's co-worker testified that O'Laughlin went back to the apartment complex and told him the person O'Laughlin was supposed to meet was not there. After discussing the matter further, O'Laughlin decided to go back to the police station accompanied by his co-worker.</p>\n<p>[8]  Chemists also collected swabs from two small, red-brown stains in the apartment that tested positive for the presumptive presence of blood, and cuttings of what appeared to be blood from O'Laughlin's bed comforter. O'Laughlin handed over to the police the clothes he said he wore the previous night and permitted the chemist to examine his boots.</p>\n<p>[9]  At booking, O'Laughlin remarked during his photograph that the mark on his face was a pimple. Trooper Michael Hill thought it was a blemish or an injury.</p>\n<p>[10]  Twelve of these prints were identifiable and excluded O'Laughlin; two were unidentifiable; and one was identifiable, but police could not match it to any known prints.</p>\n<p>[11]  Because of the contamination, only the following samples were deemed adequate for further testing: blood on Mrs. Kotowski's bathroom floor; a stain on the wall behind O'Laughlin's dresser; and two cuttings from O'Laughlin's comforter. Of these samples, it was concluded that all of the blood found in O'Laughlin's apartment belonged to him, and O'Laughlin was excluded as a possible contributor to the sample of blood taken from Mrs. Kotowski's bathroom.</p>\n<p>[12]  The SJC stated that O'Laughlin lied to the police when he told them that he was awakened by the screaming, but his telephone records show that he was making phone calls until twenty minutes before the police arrived on the scene. He later told the police that the police cruisers woke him up. Also, he told the police in an another interview that he went to bed at 11:30 p.m., awoke to screaming that he believed were animals fighting, went back to sleep and awoke to his neighbor's knock on his door who was there to inform O'Laughlin that Mrs. Kotowski was severely beaten. <i>Id.</i> at 627-28.</p>\n<p>[13]  The SJC noted O'Laughlin's third-party culprit evidence in a footnote:\n</p>\n<p>The defense sought to portray the victim's husband, from whom she had recently separated, as the third-party culprit. The husband was aware of the wife's new address and that she was involved with another man. The victim described the husband as being \"upset\" but not angry about this relationship. Others said the husband alternated between being \"nice\" and verbally abusive. The husband testified that he was at home at the time of the assault and that he received two telephone calls just before 6 a.m. Each time his \"caller ID\" indicated the source of the call as the victim's apartment, but no one was on the line. He dialed the number, and a man answered. One witness thought he saw the husband's car in his workplace parking lot at approximately 6 a.m. on the morning of the attack, but a neighbor saw the husband's car parked at home at 6:20 a.m. The husband was generally cooperative with the police, but did not permit the police access to \"personal\" letters to his wife. Tests indicated the presumptive presence of blood on one of the husband's forearms on the day of the attack. On the evening of November 17, the police observed garbage bags on the floor of the husband's garage and dark clothing in a clothes dryer. Two wet towels strongly smelling of bleach were found in a plastic bag in the trunk of the husband's car. One of the towels was the same as towels found in the victim's linen closet. The husband explained that the towels smelled because he did not know how to do laundry and had used too much bleach on them. He said he brought them on a hunting trip the previous weekend and had forgotten them in the trunk. Finally, the husband kept wooden baseball bats and other athletic equipment in his garage.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 630 n. 14.</p>\n<p>[14]  Although an analysis under § 2254(d)(1) is appropriate in the present case, we say \"generally\" because we need not conclude that we must \"evaluate a state court's resolution of a <i>Jackson</i> sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim in <i>all</i> cases under § 2254(d)(1) rather than § 2254(d)(2).\" <i>Sarausad v. Porter,</i> 479 F.3d 671, 678 (9th Cir.2007) (emphasis added), <i>rev'd on other grounds sub nom. </i><i>Waddington v. Sarausad,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 129 S.Ct. 823, 172 L.Ed.2d 532 (2009); <i>cf. id.</i> at 695 (Reinhardt, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"I see nothing in law or logic preventing us from evaluating <i>Jackson</i> claims under § 2254(d)(2), which authorizes us to grant habeas relief when the state court decision we are reviewing is `based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.'\") (quoting § 2254(d)(2)).</p>\n<p>[15]  We also note \"that a state-court adjudication of an issue framed in terms of state law may receive section 2254(d)(1) deference so long as the state standard is at least as protective of the defendant's rights as its federal counterpart.\" <i>Leftwich v. Maloney,</i> 532 F.3d 20, 23-24 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>White v. Coplan,</i> 399 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir.2005) (explaining that a federal habeas court may \"infer that the federal claim was considered if the state court rejects a counterpart state claim and then cites to a case holding that the federal constitution provides no greater protection\"). Even though the SJC did not cite <i>Jackson,</i> we have no qualms with its analysis in this respect. The SJC relied on Massachusetts case law that has expressly adopted the federal constitutional standard in <i>Jackson. See </i><i>Commonwealth v. Latimore,</i> 378 Mass. 671, 393 N.E.2d 370, 375 (1979); <i>see also </i><i>Leftwich,</i> 532 F.3d at 24 (\"Because the <i>Latimore</i> court adopted the governing federal constitutional standard as the Massachusetts standard for sufficiency of the evidence challenges,... we can securely reason that in scouring the record for <i>Latimore</i> error and finding none the SJC effectively answered the federal constitutional question.\") (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>[16]  For example, in <i>Hurtado,</i> we explained:\n</p>\n<p>[A]s a general rule, federal courts should be particularly cautious about issuing habeas, on grounds of the objective unreasonableness of a state court's conclusion that the evidence is sufficient, where there has been a verdict of guilt by a jury of a defendant's peers, where the defendant's credibility was evaluated by the jury hearing his testimony, where that verdict has been affirmed on appeal in the state system, and where there is no claim of constitutional error in the conduct of the trial. Even on direct appeal, claims that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict are \"often made, but rarely successful.\"</p>\n<p>245 F.3d at 19-20 (quoting <i>United States v. Moran,</i> 984 F.2d 1299, 1300 (1st Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p>[17]  Like the SJC, we acknowledge that to pass constitutional muster, direct evidence of identification is not necessary. \"Identification can be inferred from all the facts and circumstances that are in evidence.\" <i>Ayala,</i> 289 F.3d at 25 (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>[18]  A reenactment demonstrated that the assailant would not have been able to make out that Whittemore was calling the police.</p>\n<p>[19]  This is not to say that each of us is convinced that the state court's decision is unreasonable in every respect. But this case comes to us on arguments as presented by the parties. This panel may not be in complete unanimity in all particulars, but we do agree that the petitioner has the better of the argument with respect to the means evidence introduced by the prosecution at trial.</p>\n<p>[20]  We compare <i>infra</i> the consciousness of guilt evidence in our case to that of <i>Juan H. v. Allen,</i> 408 F.3d 1262 (9th Cir.2005). In <i>Juan H.,</i> the Ninth Circuit granted habeas relief to a petitioner in part because it viewed that any conclusion regarding the petitioner's guilt based on the prosecution's consciousness of guilt evidence amounted to no more than \"bare conjecture.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1277.</p>\n<p>[21]  This is not a case where the defendant stonewalled the police. He approached the police just minutes after the attack, he submitted to a ten-minute interview with the Chief of Police, and ultimately allowed the police to search his apartment.</p>\n<p>[22]  These include:\n</p>\n<p>(1) The focus of the inquiry is on the state court decision;</p>\n<p>(2) Even with the deference due by statute to the state court's determinations, the federal habeas court must itself look to \"the totality of the evidence\" in evaluating the state court's decision;</p>\n<p>(3) The failure of the state court to consider at all a key argument of the defendant may indicate that its conclusion is objectively unreasonable; however, the paucity of reasoning employed by the state court does not itself establish that its result is objectively unreasonable;</p>\n<p>(4) The failure of a state court to give appropriate weight to all of the evidence may mean that its conclusion is objectively unreasonable; and</p>\n<p>(5) The absence of cases of conviction precisely parallel on their facts does not, by itself, establish objective unreasonableness.</p>\n<p><i>Hurtado,</i> 245 F.3d at 18.</p>\n<p>[23]  With respect to the murder weapon, the <i>Newman</i> court acknowledged that \"the prosecution offered ample evidence to support an inference that [the petitioner] had previously possessed at least one of the murder weapons.\" <i>Id.</i> at 795. However, it noted that \"the prosecution did not offer any evidence that [the petitioner] had used or possessed the weapons on the day of the murder,\" any \"eyewitness testimony,\" any \"latent fingerprints from the crime scene or the items in the gym bag\" in which the alleged murder weapon was found. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[24]  Even if, in <i>Newman,</i> the petitioner's motive was anger because the victim had made a pass at the petitioner's girlfriend, the victim's gunshot wound is not inconsistent with this motive.</p>\n<p>[25]  As we stated above, here the SJC viewed its consciousness of guilt evidence to be most probative of O'Laughlin's guilt.</p>\n<p>[26]  As explained above, O'Laughlin's interactions with the police immediately after the assault and the day after, while not irrelevant, did not constitute sufficient evidence for a rational jury, even combined with the other circumstantial evidence, to conclude he was the assailant. Again, it may have been permissible for the jury to find that O'Laughlin possessed consciousness of guilt of some crime, such as drug possession, for which the evidence showed there was some basis, but not of a vicious attack on a neighbor with whom he had very little prior contact.</p>\n<p>[27]  O'Laughlin also claims that the SJC, in concluding that the trial judge properly excluded a note O'Laughlin alleged to have supported his third-party culprit defense, violated his constitutional right to present a defense. In view of our holding regarding O'Laughlin's <i>Jackson</i> claim, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n\n</div>",

Thus, we recount the facts largely as they were presented in the SJC's opinion.</p>\n<p>In May 2000, Mrs. Kotowski revealed to David Kotowski (\"Mr. Kotowski\"), her husband of over twenty-five years, that she was romantically involved with James Finn. In September 2000, Mrs. Kotowski moved out of her home into the Fox Hollow condominium complex in a neighboring town.<sup>[1]</sup> She resided alone. O'Laughlin, a member of Fox Hollow's maintenance staff, lived two doors down from Mrs. Kotowski. Like other members of the maintenance staff, he possessed a master key to all the buildings on the property, including a key to Mrs. Kotowski's apartment.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The SJC noted that O'Laughlin \"took some interest\" in Mrs. Kotowski prior to the attack. For example, when Mrs. Kotowski's sister was visiting, O'Laughlin stood outside her apartment and asked Mrs. Kotowski if there were \"any more good looking women in there[.]\" Also, he referred to Mrs. Kotowski five or six times in conversations with acquaintances, citing her \"beautiful antique furniture\" in her apartment as evidence of her wealth and remarking that he was attracted to her \"body type.\"<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The day before the attack, O'Laughlin cashed a $457.16 paycheck and made $200 child support payment to his ex-wife. Also, the SJC stated that O'Laughlin was agitated when he was unable to sell his trailer to his neighbor because the neighbor could not come up with $500. The neighbor paid him the next day.</p>\n<p>On the night of the attack, the SJC described O'Laughlin as \"[n]ervous, jittery, [and] paranoid....\" This was \"typical behavior when he smoked crack cocaine,\" which O'Laughlin had done earlier <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> that evening at the home of a friend, Mark Puleri.</p>\n<p>As the night wore on, O'Laughlin was \"depleted of drugs and most of his cash.\" At 9:00 or 9:30 p.m. that evening, O'Laughlin, now at home alone, telephoned another friend, Grover Finkle, asking him for a ride to purchase drugs. Finkle, who was at Richard O'Leary's house, had previously smoked crack cocaine with O'Laughlin and knew a drug dealer. Finkle and O'Leary, a taxicab driver, arrived at O'Laughlin's apartment an hour later. However, they soon left without giving O'Laughlin a ride because O'Laughlin was unable to secure money for cab fare.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In the early morning hours of November 17, between 12:10 and 1:43 a.m., fourteen telephone calls were placed to or from O'Laughlin's apartment. The majority of these calls were placed to known drug dealers.</p>\n<p>Shortly before 2:00 a.m. George Whittemore, a neighbor living directly above Mrs. Kotowski, awakened to a woman screaming directly below and the sound of \"wood hitting wood.\" According to Whittemore, a carpenter by profession, these sounds lasted for about thirty seconds.</p>\n<p>Whittemore dialed 911 at 1:55 a.m. He stayed awake until the police arrived and flashed his apartment lights to indicate his apartment to the police. Between the time he called 911 and when the police arrived, Whittemore did not hear any vehicles arrive or depart from the area. The police later conducted a reenactment of the 911 call. Based on this reenactment, they concluded that a person standing in Mrs. Kotowski's bedroom could have heard Whittemore's footsteps as he walked to the telephone as well as Whittemore's voice, but would have been unable to make out what was being said.</p>\n<p>Officers William Tierney and Phillip Skowron arrived six or seven minutes after Whittemore's 911 call. They were unable to find apartment number 202, the apartment reported in the dispatch, because the apartment numbers at the complex had been recently renumbered. They did not note anything unusual, but observed O'Laughlin walking from the building on a walkway leading from apartment number 19. O'Laughlin was wearing only boxer shorts and Officer Tierney testified that O'Laughlin appeared \"impervious\" to the near-freezing temperature.</p>\n<p>O'Laughlin questioned the officers regarding what had happened and the officers answered that they were responding to a report of a woman screaming. When they asked him if he had heard any screaming, O'Laughlin replied that he had been awakened by screaming, but believed it to be a raccoon trapped in a dumpster.<sup>[5]</sup> O'Laughlin explained that he had placed a stick in the dumpster so that it could escape. Officer Tierney then looked inside the dumpster and saw a stick, but no animal. The SJC noted that during his conversation with the officers, O'Laughlin seemed \"uneasy and distant,\" not making eye contact with them. The police further searched the area, but left after finding nothing suspicious.</p>\n<p>Whittemore testified that throughout the night he heard a woman moaning and crying directly below him.<sup>[6]</sup> He also testified that later in the morning, he heard the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> sound of glass breaking, banging, and a man outside Mrs. Kotowski's apartment calling her name. The man subsequently yelled \"Oh, my God.\"</p>\n<p>The man Whittemore was referring to was Mrs. Kotowski's boyfriend, Finn, who had arrived at 5:45 a.m. at Mrs. Kotowski's apartment. On weekdays, Finn routinely joined Mrs. Kotowski for a morning coffee prior to starting his workday. On this particular morning, when Finn knocked on the door, he only heard her say, \"Who is it?\" in a strange voice. After failing to reach her from a nearby public telephone, Finn testified that he forced open a locked sliding glass rear door. Although the living room appeared to be in order, he found Mrs. Kotowski lying on the floor next to the bed. He testified that \"there was just blood everywhere.\" Finn dialed 911 just before 6:30 a.m. Mrs. Kotowski, who had severe wounds on her head, was taken to Berkshire Medical Center. The police ruled out Finn as a suspect because of his alibi (which they confirmed), his reaction of shock upon discovering Mrs. Kotowski, and his cooperation with the police.</p>\n<p>Officers who arrived after Finn's 911 call observed blood in the victim's bedroom on the bed, the pillow, the floors, the walls, and on the door jambs of the bathroom and bedroom. The SJC noted that the crime scene contained \"`quite a bit of blood' that appeared to be `splatters' on the comforter.\" Further, the bed rail was dented, with wood splinters on the ground beneath the dent. Officer Skowron testified that everything else was intact as the apartment was neat and nothing was displaced. Mrs. Kotowski's purse was on the floor, however. Officer Skowron also testified that there were no signs that the front door or the rear sliding door had been forced open (which contradicted a report by an earlier officer on the scene stating that the rear door was broken); that the drawers were closed; and that the light and figurines on the dresser were upright. Mrs. Kotowski testified that no items of value were missing from the apartment. These items, which were in plain view on top of the dresser, included diamonds, pearls, and an expensive watch in the bedroom. Also, Mrs. Kotowski's purse contained her credit cards, about $28 in cash, and a checkbook. There was $522 in cash in a dresser drawer.</p>\n<p>Constance Cappel, a neighbor who lived in the apartment between O'Laughlin and Mrs. Kotowski, testified that she heard voices outside Mrs. Kotowski's apartment at about 6:45 a.m. Cappel went outside and saw Mrs. Kotowski being loaded into an ambulance. She knocked on O'Laughlin's door and told him that she thought someone had been murdered. O'Laughlin, who answered the door in his boxer shorts and looked like he had just awoken, responded \"What do you want me to do about it?\"</p>\n<p>At 8:45 a.m. O'Laughlin came out of his apartment dressed for work, approached one of his co-workers and Cappel, and inquired about what was happening. After his co-worker explained the situation, O'Laughlin described his encounter with the police the previous night and how he had been awakened by the police cruisers. O'Laughlin also informed his co-worker that he told the police that he thought raccoons had been in the dumpster making a \"kind of squealing sound.\"</p>\n<p>At about 9:40 a.m., Officers Tierney and Todd Briggs talked with O'Laughlin outside the apartment building and Officer Tierney noticed a \"scratch or a dig mark in [O'Laughlin's] left cheek, [a] small cut on his chin and a round, circular bruise ... just below his left ear.\" Officer Tierney was unsure about how fresh these marks were.</p>\n<p>The SJC remarked that although O'Laughlin was initially \"reluctant,\" he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> agreed to give a statement at the police station when informed that Officer Tierney would conduct the interview. O'Laughlin arrived at the station at 10:40 a.m., but was told by Chief Ronald Glidden to wait for Officer Tierney, who had yet to arrive. Officer Tierney arrived twenty minutes later and told O'Laughlin that he would be \"right with him.\" However, when he returned five minutes later, O'Laughlin had left.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>O'Laughlin returned to the police station twenty minutes later and was interviewed by Chief Glidden for about ten minutes. Chief Glidden testified that O'Laughlin \"seemed agitated\" during the interview. In his statement to Chief Glidden, O'Laughlin stated that he had been \"drinking before he went to bed and he just didn't think he was awake until he heard the cruisers at approximately two o'clock.\" He thought he may have heard foxes or raccoons before that, but was uncertain. O'Laughlin said that he had \"seen [the victim] around,\"; that he and a friend had joked about her boyfriend; and that he had been in that apartment to repair a window. After the interview concluded, he went home.</p>\n<p>State Troopers David Buell and Brian Berkel arrived at the complex around noon. Trooper Buell spoke to O'Laughlin, who stated that he had been out with his friend, Puleri, the previous night, returned at 10:30 p.m., went to sleep around 11:30 p.m., and was awakened by screaming, which he thought was a fox fighting with a raccoon. O'Laughlin said that a short time later the police arrived and he went out to speak with them. After the officers left, he slept until 7:30 a.m., when he was awakened by his neighbor, who had informed him that there had been a murder.</p>\n<p>Trooper Buell asked O'Laughlin for consent to search his apartment in order to eliminate him as a suspect and because his apartment was in close proximity to Mrs. Kotowski's apartment. O'Laughlin consented, and allowed Trooper Berkel to take photographs and two police chemists to search for blood stains. Trooper Berkel photographed a red stain on a closet door near the kitchen area. A chemist who saw the stain asked O'Laughlin if his consent included taking swabbings. O'Laughlin responded that it did not. Soon thereafter, O'Laughlin asked the officers to leave his apartment.</p>\n<p>Outside the apartment, the police decided to apply for a search warrant. They returned to O'Laughlin's apartment and informed him of their intent to secure the apartment and obtain a warrant. O'Laughlin replied that they did not need to pursue a warrant because he would allow them back into the apartment. He also told the officers that he had wiped the red stain off the closet door with his finger, and thought it was his own blood, but was not certain. O'Laughlin told the police that he was concerned about a search because he was afraid police would find his drug paraphernalia and because he possessed money that he did not want taken. Trooper Buell asked O'Laughlin to give him the drug paraphernalia, telling him that he would not be charged with drug possession.</p>\n<p>When the chemists returned to the apartment, the red stain on the closet door was gone. However, the area, where the stain had been, tested positive for the presumptive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> presence of blood. The chemists collected a sample by swabbing.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>A state trooper searched the area surrounding the apartment complex with a dog trained to search by scent. The dog found an aluminum bat about twenty-five yards away from a building's dumpster in the woods. It appeared to be covered in leaves and debris, but was otherwise clean. O'Laughlin's name was inscribed on the bat.</p>\n<p>On November 20, O'Laughlin called a friend and informed him that he was a suspect in the assault. The SJC noted that O'Laughlin was \"upset\" while he told his friend that he was \"very happy that [Mrs. Kotowski] had survived ... [s]o that she could identify her assailant,\" but with his bad luck the assailant could have been wearing a \"Nixon mask\" and entered with a baseball bat.</p>\n<p>Later that day O'Laughlin was arrested. While in custody, O'Laughlin told an inmate that although he owned the bat, he last saw it when he moved into his apartment.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>The police recovered fourteen fingerprints and one palm print from Mrs. Kotowski's apartment, none of which matched those of O'Laughlin.<sup>[10]</sup> In addition, footprint impressions taken at the apartment did not match O'Laughlin's boots. State Police Lieutenant Brian O'Hara, trained in fingerprint analysis and bloodstain patterns, opined that a blood stain on Mrs. Kotowski's pillow was caused by the transfer of blood from a person's right hand, but the handprint was unidentifiable. He testified that the hand had to have had a significant amount of blood on it, not all of which would have been transferred.</p>\n<p>A state police chemist examined the aluminum bat found in the woods. Three small reddish brown stains on the bat tested positive for the presumptive presence of blood, only one of which tested positive for human blood. The three stains were swabbed and sent to the DNA unit for further testing. There was contamination in the DNA lab, and thus the tests consumed all the testable material without yielding results. An additional cutting from tape on the bat's handle, an area where the presumptive presence of blood could still be detected, was submitted to the laboratory. A state police DNA analyst concluded that while Mrs. Kotowski could not be excluded as a contributor, one in two of any randomly selected individuals could have been the contributor.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>A surgeon who performed reconstructive surgeries on Mrs. Kotowski after the attack testified that she had sustained between fifteen to twenty blows that broke <span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> nearly every bone in her face and skull. The only exception was her jaw. She also had defensive wounds on her hands caused by five to ten blows. The surgeon gave an opinion that Mrs. Kotowski's injuries were caused by a long, sturdy, hard, round object, consistent with an aluminum bat that was recovered in the woods on the day of the attack.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural History</h2>\n<p>In December 2000, A Berkshire County grand jury charged O'Laughlin with four offenses: (1) burglary and armed assault in a dwelling, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, § 14; (2) armed assault in a dwelling, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 18A; (3) armed assault with intent to murder, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 18(b); and (4) assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 15A(b).</p>\n<p>Following a nine-day jury trial in May 2002, O'Laughlin was convicted of all four charges. O'Laughlin appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The Massachusetts Appeals Court Opinion</h2>\n<p>On appeal, the Massachusetts Appeals Court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdicts. The Appeals Court stated that while the government's evidence demonstrated that O'Laughlin had a motive of robbery, an opportunity to commit the crime, a means to commit the crime, and a consciousness of guilt, the evidence was not enough to establish guilt. The Appeals Court concluded that \"[n]othing in the record sufficiently links the defendant to the crime to permit the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the perpetrator\" and that \"[p]iling inference upon inference does not amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>O'Laughlin I,</i> 830 N.E.2d at 231-32. In reaching its conclusion, the Appeals Court noted that the bat was only \"consistent\" with the weapon used in the attack; that O'Laughlin's lies to the police concerning his whereabouts and his removal of the stain from his closet door, \"while certainly permissible to show a guilty conscience, cannot fill the gap in the proof of identity\"; that O'Laughlin did not show physical strain in his appearance and demeanor when confronted by the police just about twelve minutes after the attack, which would have been consistent with someone who had just committed such a \"brutal\" attack; and that the third-party culprit evidence in this case detracted from the government's case. <i>Id.</i> at 232-34. Thus, the Appeals Court reversed O'Laughlin's convictions and directed that judgments be entered in his favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The SJC Opinion</h2>\n<p>The Commonwealth then sought and received further appellate review from the SJC. The SJC concluded that the evidence against O'Laughlin had been sufficient and affirmed his convictions, stating that circumstantial evidence of motive, opportunity, means, and consciousness of guilt \"permissibly convinced the jury of the defendant's guilt.\" <i>O'Laughlin II,</i> 843 N.E.2d at 627.</p>\n<p>The SJC stated that the jury could permissibly find that O'Laughlin's motive to break into Mrs. Kotowski's apartment was robbery. <i>Id.</i> It pointed to the fact that O'Laughlin had taken drugs twice previously on the night of November 16, had \"run out\" of drugs and money, and was calling around as late as 1:43 a.m. to purchase drugs, which the SJC noted was \"only twelve minutes before the victims' upstairs neighbor telephoned the police department to report screams and banging sounds from downstairs.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The SJC further noted that O'Laughlin had previously entered the victim's apartment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*296</span> and \"had reason to believe that she was wealthy and might have cash or valuables.\" <i>Id.</i> The SJC commented that O'Laughlin \"needed money immediately and the victim was a nearby and likely source.\" <i>Id.</i> Accounting for the fact that nothing was taken from the apartment, the SJC pointed to a reenactment during trial demonstrating that the neighbor could be heard in the apartment below when he called the police. The SJC concluded that \"[i]t is a reasonable inference that the defendant was frightened off before he could steal anything when he heard the neighbor speaking.\" <i>Id.</i> at 627 n. 11.</p>\n<p>The SJC also concluded that O'Laughlin had the opportunity to commit the crime because he resided only two apartment doors away from Mrs. Kotowski and that he had a master key which gave him access to her apartment. <i>Id.</i> at 627. In addition, the SJC pointed to Whittemore's testimony that he did not hear any cars going to or from the apartment complex in the interval between when he first heard the screaming and when the police arrived. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The SJC also reasoned that O'Laughlin had the means to commit the crime by stating that the aluminum bat was found a short distance from Mrs. Kotowski's apartment complex. <i>Id.</i> The SJC stated that \"[t]he jury would certainly be warranted in concluding that the bat was the defendant's.\" <i>Id.</i> The SJC explained that \"[h]is surname, not a common one, was visible on the bat handle and he mentioned to someone in jail that he was the owner of the bat the police had found.\" <i>Id.</i> The SJC further noted, however, that although the bat was covered by some leaves and debris, it was otherwise \"clean\" when discovered. <i>Id.</i> It also acknowledged O'Laughlin's statement that he had not seen the bat since the day he had moved into his apartment. <i>Id.</i> at 627 n. 12.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the SJC indicated the significant evidence pointing to O'Laughlin's consciousness of guilt. <i>Id.</i> at 627. First, the SJC referenced O'Laughlin's demeanor when the police first arrived on the scene and discovered O'Laughlin outside in his \"boxer shorts in near freezing temperature.\" <i>Id.</i> The SJC noted that when he talked with the police, he was \"uneasy and distant\" and did not make eye contact with the police officers. <i>Id.</i> Also, the SJC remarked that the differing versions O'Laughlin gave to police as to the reason he woke up was indicative of his untruthfulness.<sup>[12]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 627-28. The SJC further noted that O'Laughlin reluctantly participated in an interview with the police and seemed \"agitated\" when he spoke with them. <i>Id.</i> at 628.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the SJC pointed to O'Laughlin's reaction to the police's request when they asked for a swabbing of the red stain in the closet door of his apartment. <i>Id.</i> Although O'Laughlin later allowed the police to return, the stain was gone and O'Laughlin admitted to having removed it with his finger, saying that he believed that it was his own blood. The SJC concluded that \"[t]his evidence reflected not merely a general consciousness of guilt, but indicated that the defendant feared that the blood stain could be that of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*297</span> victim, a fear he would have only if he were in fact the perpetrator.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, the SJC pointed to the fact that O'Laughlin had \"a `scratch or dig mark' on his cheek, a small cut on his chin and a bruise on his neck.\" <i>Id.</i> While acknowledging that the police officer could not discern whether the marks were \"fresh,\" the SJC concluded that \"it could be inferred that the injuries were sustained during a physical encounter with the victim.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In sum, the SJC stated that the evidence taken together \"was sufficient to permit the jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the perpetrator of the vicious attack on the victim.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In reversing the lower appellate court decision, the SJC distinguished its case law in <i>Commonwealth v. Mazza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2034862\"><a href=\"/opinion/2034862/commonwealth-v-mazza/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2034862\"><a href=\"/opinion/2034862/commonwealth-v-mazza/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span> (1987), stating that in the instant case the prosecution \"presented more evidence linking [O'Laughlin] to the assault.\" <i>O'Laughlin II,</i> 843 N.E.2d at 629. Furthermore, the instant case contained evidence of means as represented by the aluminum bat, \"significantly stronger evidence of consciousness of guilt,\" bruises on O'Laughlin's face, and the fact that O'Laughlin was wearing only boxers when the police found him, which \"would be consistent with his having disposed of bloody outer garments.\" <i>Id.</i> With respect to O'Laughlin's attire, the SJC added that \"[t]he jury could find that, had the defendant gone outside to check for animals in the dumpster (as he claimed), it was implausible that he would have done so without putting on at least minimal clothing, not only for purposes of protection against the cold but also for purposes of decency.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The SJC disagreed with the weight placed by the Appeals Court on the fact that O'Laughlin \"did not manifest any signs of recent physical exertion (sweat, shortness of breath, wet hair or disarray)\" twelve minutes after the attack. <i>Id.</i> at 629 n. 13. The SJC stated that this did not detract from the government's case because twelve minutes after the attack there would be no reason for O'Laughlin to show signs of this physical exertion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Also, the SJC disagreed with the Appeals Court that the third-party culprit evidence presented in this case detracted from the government's argument or affected the sufficiency of the evidence because it was not \"so overwhelming that no rational jury could conclude that the defendant was guilty.\" <i>Id.</i> at 630. The SJC stated that the third-party culprit evidence \"simply tended to contradict the Commonwealth's evidence; it did not show it to be incredible or conclusively incorrect.\"<sup>[13]</sup><i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*298</span> 3. O'Laughlin's Habeas Petition</h2>\n<p>In his habeas petition before the district court, O'Laughlin alleged that (1) the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove that he was a perpetrator of the offenses for which he was convicted; and (2) the trial court violated his right to present a defense by excluding a handwritten note that, according to O'Laughlin, supported his third-party culprit defense. After briefing by the parties and a non-evidentiary hearing, the district court denied O'Laughlin's petition reasoning that \"like the courts that have looked at this cold record before me, this is a close question. But the petition must be under federal law denied.\"</p>\n<p>O'Laughlin then filed a timely notice of appeal and requested a Certificate of Appealability (\"COA\") as to his sufficiency and right-to-present a defense claims.

Analysis of the SJC Opinion</h2>\n<p>As our sister court has noted, \"[a]lthough circumstantial evidence alone can support a conviction, there are times that it amounts to only a reasonable speculation and not to sufficient evidence.\" <i>Newman,</i> 543 F.3d at 796. This is such a case.</p>\n<p>The instant facts may support a reasonable speculation that O'Laughlin was the assailant, but not sufficient evidence to establish his guilt. Taken together, the circumstantial evidence in this case, even when drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, does not permit any rational jury to conclude that O'Laughlin was the assailant beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the evidence that O'Laughlin acted upon a financial motive to commit the attack is weak at best. A jury could permissibly conclude that he needed money to acquire crack cocaine, giving him reason to break into Mrs. Kotowski's apartment, a person whom he knew had money. However, Mrs. Kotowski testified that nothing of value was taken and no items, not even expensive jewelry in plain view, were disturbed. The SJC accounted for this fact by stating that the jury could draw \"a reasonable inference that the defendant was frightened off before he could steal anything when he heard the neighbor [Whittemore] speaking.\" <i>O'Laughlin II,</i> 843 N.E.2d at 627 n. 11. Even if the assailant deduced that the neighbor was calling the police in response to the attack,<sup>[18]</sup> no rational juror could conclude that the placement of this phone call frightened him off given the volume and duration of Mrs. Kotowski's screams. Moreover, the assailant's actions are inconsistent with O'Laughlin's purported financial motive in view of the savage beating Mrs. Kotowski suffered at the hands of the assailant, an attack involving at least fifteen to twenty blows that nearly broke every bone in her face and skull. If the assailant were motivated by money, a few blows to incapacitate her would have been sufficient.</p>\n<p>With respect to the opportunity to commit the crime, O'Laughlin had a master key and there were no signs of forced entry; thus, one possible inference is that O'Laughlin used his master key to enter Mrs. Kotowski's apartment. It is notable, however, that several others on the maintenance staff possessed a master key. Also, Mrs. Kotowski could have let someone familiar to her into the apartment.</p>\n<p>With respect to the means for the attack, a jury could permissibly find that the aluminum bat found in the woods was O'Laughlin's bat given that his name was on the bat and that he admitted to owning the bat at one time. Yet, there was little evidence connecting the aluminum bat, a non-unique item in a residential complex, to the crime scene apart from the fact that it was found twenty-five yards from the residential complex the following day and the use of such an object was \"consistent\" with Mrs. Kotowski's injuries.<sup>[19]</sup> Of course, any bat likely would have been consistent with her injuries. Also, Whittemore, a carpenter, testified that he heard \"wood hitting wood,\" as opposed to hearing the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*303</span> sound of a hollow aluminum bat, when he was awakened. Furthermore, wooden bats were found in Mrs. Kotowski's estranged husband's garage.</p>\n<p>We next turn to O'Laughlin's consciousness of guilt, which the SJC considered the strongest evidence in favor of reinstating the conviction.<sup>[20]</sup> When viewed in context, this evidence is minimally probative on the question of whether O'Laughlin was the assailant.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the fact that it was just after 2:00 a.m., the SJC cited to O'Laughlin's \"uneasy and distant\" demeanor and his unwillingness to look Officers Tierney and Skowron in the eye when they confronted him just minutes after the attack. However, both officers, even though they were responding to reports of a possible assault, did not consider O'Laughlin's behavior suspicious at the time. Indeed, they initially believed he was the reporting party and after asking him a few brief questions they left the area. Even the fact that O'Laughlin was only clad in boxers in near-freezing temperature did not give them pause after he explained to them that he was awakened by animal screams and had gone outside to place a stick in the dumpster, a fact Officer Tierney promptly verified. Also, the SJC explained that a jury could find it \"implausible\" that O'Laughlin would have gone outside without \"putting on at least minimal clothing\" if his true reason for going outside was to check for animals. Yet, Officer Tierney stated that O'Laughlin appeared unfazed by the cold and O'Laughlin's alibi shows that he did not intend to stay outside for a very long time.</p>\n<p>The other consciousness of guilt evidence cited by the SJC  O'Laughlin's reluctance to be interviewed by the police, the inconsistent versions of how he was awoken, his reaction to the neighbor's report of an assault, the fact that he was agitated during the interview, and his reaction when the police wanted to swab his closet door  while not helpful to his case, are not enough, even when considered in combination with other circumstantial evidence, to allow a jury to permissibly conclude O'Laughlin's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>With respect to this evidence, the fact that O'Laughlin was reluctant to come down to the police station and displayed some agitation during the interview has minimal probative value in determining whether O'Laughlin was the assailant. Although this behavior could indicate consciousness of guilt for some crime, such as possessing crack cocaine (which the evidence shows he admitted to being concerned about), it is an impermissible inferential leap for a jury to find this behavior significantly probative of whether O'Laughlin committed such a brutal attack.<sup>[21]</sup> Likewise, his indifferent reaction to his neighbor informing him of the attack the following morning may bear on whether he was a compassionate person, but has little probative value in assessing O'Laughlin's guilt.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*304</span> Admittedly, the conflicting versions O'Laughlin gave the police as to how he was awoken and his reaction to the police's request to swab his closet door when they were searching his home could be probative evidence linking O'Laughlin to the crime. However, in light of O'Laughlin's concerns that the police would discover his drug use, this evidence was insufficient to serve as the primary basis upon which the jury could rely to conclude O'Laughlin's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the SJC cited bruises and marks on O'Laughlin's face as evidence from which the jury could infer that an altercation occurred between O'Laughlin and Mrs. Kotowski. However, these bruises and marks have minimal, if any, probative force given the fact that they were not even noted by Officers Tierney and Skowron when they were responding to an assault just minutes after the attack.</p>\n<p>It bears repeating that the prosecution had to rely on circumstantial evidence because no physical or DNA evidence linked O'Laughlin to the attack despite the copious amount of blood at the crime scene. Considering the large amount of blood, it is difficult to fathom how O'Laughlin was able to avoid having any blood or other DNA evidence connect him to Mrs. Kotowski. Given the insufficiency of the evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, tying O'Laughlin to the attack, we conclude that a rational jury could not find O'Laughlin's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Objectively Unreasonable Standard for Purposes of Habeas Review</h2>\n<p>Although we have identified several gaps in the SJC's analysis, we are mindful that on habeas review under AEDPA we are not permitted to grant a writ if we merely disagree with the jury verdict or if we identify an error in the SJC's reasoning. The relevant inquiry is whether the SJC was objectively unreasonable in upholding the conviction.</p>\n<p>We once again acknowledge the extremely high bar that must be overcome on habeas review to overturn a state court decision; however, that bar is not insurmountable and on rare occasions we have held a state court decision to be objectively unreasonable. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>White,</i> 399 F.3d at 25 (holding on habeas review that state court unreasonably applied Supreme Court's Confrontation Clause jurisprudence where state court barred petitioner from cross examining complainants regarding prior accusations).</p>\n<p>This court has identified certain guidelines that it finds useful in analyzing sufficiency claims on habeas review.<sup>[22]</sup> In addition, we note that although we evaluate the state court decision in light of Supreme Court precedent, we are not precluded from looking at other federal court decisions that may help guide us in applying <span class=\"star-pagination\">*305</span> the <i>Jackson</i> standard. Indeed, \"`[d]ecisions from the lower federal courts may help inform the AEDPA analysis to the extent that they state the clearly established federal law determined by the Supreme Court.'\" <i>Evans,</i> 518 F.3d at 10 (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Aspen v. Bissonnette,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202666\"><a href=\"/opinion/202666/aspen-v-bissonette/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 574 n. 1 (1st Cir.2007)). This is especially true when \"`factually similar cases from the lower federal courts' can `provid[e] a valuable reference point' when considering the reasonableness of a state court's application of Supreme Court precedent to a particular set of facts.\" <i>Id.</i> (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Rashad v. Walsh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200079\"><a href=\"/opinion/200079/rashad-v-walsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2002)). Under § 2254(d)(1), we are not constrained in our \"ability to draw from any legal source in determining whether the state court's decision rests on constitutional error or is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. [Section 2254(d)(1)] only limits the grounds on which habeas relief may be granted.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>With this in mind, we look to a recent case, <i>Newman v. Metrish</i><i>,</i> where the Sixth Circuit held a state court ruling to be objectively unreasonable on grounds that the prosecution did not present sufficient evidence to support a prosecution for murder of a known drug dealer. 543 F.3d at 797. In <i>Newman,</i> the prosecution presented evidence at trial that the petitioner planned to rob drug dealers for drugs or money; that the victim was a known drug dealer who kept drugs in his freezer; that the petitioner and the victim were known to engage in drug transactions in the past; that the victim's freezer was \"open and empty\" after he was killed; and that the petitioner had a motive for the killing because he had seen the victim \"make a pass\" at the petitioner's girlfriend. <i>Id.</i> at 794. Furthermore, the prosecution presented evidence supporting an inference that Newman had possessed and once purchased the murder weapon. <i>Id.</i> This evidence included forensic evidence and the fact that the petitioner's friend saw a gun similar to the murder weapon in the petitioner's home a few weeks prior to the murder.<sup>[23]</sup><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In analyzing the evidence under <i>Jackson,</i> the <i>Newman</i> court stated that even when \"consider[ing] all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, there remains reasonable doubt because we are limited by what inferences reason will allow us to draw.\" <i>Id.</i> at 797. It remarked that these limitations included its ability to \"infer only that [the petitioner] intended to rob a drug dealer and knew that [the victim] was a drug dealer, that a gun previously owned by [the petitioner] was used to kill [the victim], and that a similar looking gun was seen in [the petitioner's] home approximately two weeks before the murder.\" <i>Id.</i> The <i>Newman</i> court added that \"even assuming that [the petitioner's] gun was indeed the one used in the homicide, there was no evidence of what happened to it between that date and the date of the homicide, and we need not speculate as to what might have happened.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The <i>Newman</i> court reasoned that while there was \"a wealth of information showing that [the petitioner] owned the gun,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*306</span> \"evidence placing [the petitioner] at the scene\" was \"conspicuously absent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 797. It pointed to the fact that there was no eyewitness testimony and the police did not recover any fingerprints from the crime scene. <i>Id.</i> The <i>Newman</i> court stated that \"[w]ithout additional evidence placing [him] at the scene of the crime, there is only a reasonable speculation that [the petitioner] himself was present.\" <i>Id.</i> It concluded that \"where the evidence taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution creates only a reasonable speculation that a defendant was present at the crime, there is insufficient evidence to satisfy the <i>Jackson</i> standard.\" <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, the <i>Newman</i> court declared the state court ruling an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>While <i>Newman</i>'s reasoning certainly does not control our analysis, it is significant that our sister court ruled a state court decision to be objectively unreasonable under <i>Jackson</i> on facts more probative of a petitioner's guilt than what we have here. For example, O'Laughlin, like the petitioner in <i>Newman,</i> was not connected to the crime scene by forensic evidence or eyewitness testimony; however, unlike the petitioner in <i>Newman</i> who had prior business dealings with the victim in that case, O'Laughlin had minimal contact with the victim apart from a few casual conversations and a maintenance call. Moreover, the petitioner's robbery motive in <i>Newman</i> was consistent with the evidence  as the victim's freezer, which was his storage place for drugs, was open and empty.<sup>[24]</sup> In the instant case, however, O'Laughlin's alleged motive of robbery to satisfy his need for crack cocaine does not align with the fact that nothing of value was taken from Mrs. Kotowski's apartment or with how savagely she was beaten at the hands of her assailant. Lastly, in <i>Newman,</i> the petitioner owned a gun whose spent cartridges and bullets matched those found in the victim's body. Here, the aluminum baseball bat that O'Laughlin owned was merely \"consistent\" with Mrs. Kotowski's injuries, in the same way a metal pipe or some other long, sturdy object would be consistent with her injuries.</p>\n<p>Another decision from a sister court also informs our analysis as to whether the SJC unreasonably applied the <i>Jackson</i> standard. In <i>Juan H. v. Allen</i><i>,</i> the Ninth Circuit held that the state court decision was objectively unreasonable because there was insufficient evidence to conclude that a juvenile petitioner aided and abetted a principal in committing first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder. 408 F.3d at 1278-79.</p>\n<p>In <i>Juan H.,</i> the state court had concluded that the petitioner had \"manifested consciousness of guilt\" because he `fled from the crime scene; he attempted to leave his home with his family after the shooting; and he gave a false alibi to the police that he was in a trailer and not present during the shooting. <i>Id.</i> at 1277. Also, as motive evidence, the state court cited petitioner's gang gestures towards the victim and the fact that the petitioner had punched the victim on a prior occasion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>With respect to the evidence of flight, the <i>Juan H.</i> court reasoned that \"[n]o reasonable trier of fact could find evidence of criminal culpability in the decision of a teenager to run home from the scene of a shooting, regardless of whether the home was in the same general direction as the car of a fleeing suspect.\" <i>Id.</i> The <i>Juan H.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*307</span> court added that \"[l]ikewise, any rational factfinder would find little or no evidence of guilt in the fact that [the petitioner] attempted, along with the rest of his family, to leave his home as it was being surrounded by an angry mob of neighbors.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Regarding the false alibi, the <i>Juan H.</i> court remarked that it was \"bare conjecture\" to regard the petitioner's untrue statements to the police as reflective of consciousness of guilt. <i>Id.</i> The court explained that the petitioner \"might have made a false statement to law enforcement for any number of reasons, especially given that any statements he made as a witness would likely be used to prosecute his older brother, a member of his immediate family.\" <i>Id.</i> The <i>Juan H.</i> court stressed: \"Although we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, a `reasonable' inference is one that is supported by a chain of logic, rather than, as in this case, mere speculation dressed up in the guise of evidence.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, the <i>Juan H.</i> court stated that the prosecution's motive evidence was mere conjecture, reasoning that the \"interpersonal tensions\" between the petitioner and the victim \"do not create a sufficiently strong inference of motive to allow a reasonable trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that [the petitioner] had reason to aid and abet first-degree murder.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1278.</p>\n<p>The <i>Juan H.</i> court maintained that \"[s]peculation and conjecture cannot take the place of reasonable inferences and evidence  whether direct or circumstantial  that [the petitioner]  through both guilty mind and guilty act  acted in consort with [the principal].\" <i>Id.</i> at 1279. Applying the <i>Jackson</i> standard to the state court decision, the <i>Juan H.</i> court ruled that \"only speculation ... supports a conclusion\" that the petitioner was guilty of aiding and abetting the first-degree murders. <i>Id.</i> It concluded that \"[s]uch a lack of evidence violates the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee that an accused must go free unless and until the prosecution presents evidence that proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>In re Winship,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, 365-68, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span> (1970)).</p>\n<p>Admittedly, the facts in <i>Juan H.</i> do not line up precisely with those of the instant case. However, we find instructive the <i>Juan H.</i> court's treatment of its consciousness of guilt evidence.<sup>[25]</sup> The <i>Juan H.</i> court held that the petitioner's lies about his presence at the crime scene and the fact that he fled the area were insufficient to support an inference that he aided and abetted the murderer, reasoning that a conclusion regarding the petitioner's guilt from this evidence would be no more than \"bare conjecture.\"</p>\n<p>The evidence in <i>Juan H.</i> is far more reflective of consciousness of guilt than what we have here. Unlike the petitioner in <i>Juan H.,</i> O'Laughlin was not caught in a lie about whether he was present at the crime scene and did not flee the scene of the crime. In fact, O'Laughlin approached the police just minutes after the attack.<sup>[26]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*308</span> Similar to the <i>Juan H.</i> court's reasoning, this consciousness of guilt evidence constituted \"bare conjecture\" regarding O'Laughlin's guilt and thus renders the SJC decision that relied primarily on this evidence, objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p>We reiterate that <i>Juan H.</i> and <i>Newman,</i> while not controlling, powerfully illustrate how federal courts, acting under the AEDPA regime, can hold in appropriate circumstances state court decisions to be objectively unreasonable when applying <i>Jackson.</i> Our sister courts' reasoning in these cases underscore why we believe habeas relief should be granted in the instant case.</p>\n<p>Our holding is further bolstered by a post-AEDPA case of our own, <i>Leftwich v. Maloney</i><i>,</i> where a petitioner claimed there to be insufficient evidence for a state court to correctly identify him as the perpetrator of the offense for which he was convicted. <i>See </i><i>Leftwich,</i> 532 F.3d at 21. Although we held that habeas relief was not warranted in <i>Leftwich,</i> it is helpful to consider the factors we considered relevant.</p>\n<p>In <i>Leftwich,</i> the petitioner argued that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that he was a principal rather than an accessory to the murder of a bishop who had taken the petitioner in when he was released from prison. <i>Id.</i> In holding that there was sufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict, the <i>Leftwich</i> court considered that the petitioner confessed to being in the same place, a ditch, within minutes of when the murder occurred; that the police recovered from the petitioner a Leatherman tool whose length and width were consistent with the victim's wounds; that he \"embarked on a wide-ranging cleaning spree\" shortly before his arrest; that forensic evidence included fingerprint evidence and the victim's blood on the petitioner's clothes and hands; that the petitioner lied about having any knowledge of the victim's death; that the petitioner's motive resulted from the victim's disapproval of the petitioner's use of company credit card to satisfy a gambling debt; and that the \"record [was] barren of any evidence as to who besides the petitioner could have inflicted the fatal stab wounds.\" <i>Id.</i> at 25-27.</p>\n<p>We note the many distinguishing features of the instant case as compared to <i>Leftwich.</i> Specifically, unlike the petitioner in <i>Leftwich,</i> there was no physical or forensic evidence linking O'Laughlin to the crime scene; O'Laughlin's financial motive was inconsistent with the evidence in Mrs. Kotowski's apartment; and O'Laughlin presented compelling third-party evidence that Mr. Kotowski was the actual assailant. We recognize that the stronger evidence supporting the petitioner's guilt in <i>Leftwich,</i> when compared to the present case, is not persuasive by itself to render the evidence insufficient here. However, the fact that the instant facts satisfy very few of the criteria the <i>Leftwich</i> court considered relevant in its <i>Jackson</i> analysis, provides additional support for our conclusion here that the SJC's decision to reinstate the conviction was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge the many strands of circumstantial evidence the prosecution has presented in this case; however, when viewing this evidence in its totality, as we must do on habeas review, that evidence is far from sufficient to establish O'Laughlin's guilt under <i>Jackson.</i> Based on the record before us and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, we hold that it would be overly speculative to conclude O'Laughlin to be the assailant beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we conclude that the SJC's decision to uphold O'Laughlin's conviction was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*309</span> III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because double jeopardy principles apply here, we remand to the district court to order O'Laughlin's unconditional release with prejudice to reprosecution. <i>See </i><i>Burks v.

(Other witnesses described the husband's attitude as alternating between loving and angry.)\" Approximately a week before the attack, she conversed for the first time with her husband about the possibility of getting a divorce. Mrs. Kotowski testified that Mr. Kotowski was \"crushed\" by the move.</p>\n<p>[2]  O'Laughlin had been inside Mrs. Kotowski's apartment at least once previously in September to fix a window, among other tasks.</p>\n<p>[3]  In addition, the SJC states that just days before the attack, one acquaintance testified that O'Laughlin had \"really scared\" Mrs. Kotowski by inquiring \"about the window in her apartment.\" However, once Mrs. Kotowski realized he was on the maintenance staff, she simply walked away.</p>\n<p>[4]  O'Leary refused to drive unless O'Laughlin provided him with an advance payment.</p>\n<p>[5]  O'Laughlin's supervisor testified that the complex had been having problems with raccoons getting caught in the dumpster.</p>\n<p>[6]  Although he heard these sounds, Whittemore did not contact the police again that night.</p>\n<p>[7]  O'Laughlin's co-worker testified that O'Laughlin went back to the apartment complex and told him the person O'Laughlin was supposed to meet was not there. After discussing the matter further, O'Laughlin decided to go back to the police station accompanied by his co-worker.</p>\n<p>[8]  Chemists also collected swabs from two small, red-brown stains in the apartment that tested positive for the presumptive presence of blood, and cuttings of what appeared to be blood from O'Laughlin's bed comforter. O'Laughlin handed over to the police the clothes he said he wore the previous night and permitted the chemist to examine his boots.</p>\n<p>[9]  At booking, O'Laughlin remarked during his photograph that the mark on his face was a pimple. Trooper Michael Hill thought it was a blemish or an injury.</p>\n<p>[10]  Twelve of these prints were identifiable and excluded O'Laughlin; two were unidentifiable; and one was identifiable, but police could not match it to any known prints.</p>\n<p>[11]  Because of the contamination, only the following samples were deemed adequate for further testing: blood on Mrs. Kotowski's bathroom floor; a stain on the wall behind O'Laughlin's dresser; and two cuttings from O'Laughlin's comforter. Of these samples, it was concluded that all of the blood found in O'Laughlin's apartment belonged to him, and O'Laughlin was excluded as a possible contributor to the sample of blood taken from Mrs. Kotowski's bathroom.</p>\n<p>[12]  The SJC stated that O'Laughlin lied to the police when he told them that he was awakened by the screaming, but his telephone records show that he was making phone calls until twenty minutes before the police arrived on the scene. He later told the police that the police cruisers woke him up. Also, he told the police in an another interview that he went to bed at 11:30 p.m., awoke to screaming that he believed were animals fighting, went back to sleep and awoke to his neighbor's knock on his door who was there to inform O'Laughlin that Mrs. Kotowski was severely beaten. <i>Id.</i> at 627-28.</p>\n<p>[13]  The SJC noted O'Laughlin's third-party culprit evidence in a footnote:\n</p>\n<p>The defense sought to portray the victim's husband, from whom she had recently separated, as the third-party culprit. The husband was aware of the wife's new address and that she was involved with another man. The victim described the husband as being \"upset\" but not angry about this relationship. Others said the husband alternated between being \"nice\" and verbally abusive. The husband testified that he was at home at the time of the assault and that he received two telephone calls just before 6 a.m. Each time his \"caller ID\" indicated the source of the call as the victim's apartment, but no one was on the line. He dialed the number, and a man answered. One witness thought he saw the husband's car in his workplace parking lot at approximately 6 a.m. on the morning of the attack, but a neighbor saw the husband's car parked at home at 6:20 a.m. The husband was generally cooperative with the police, but did not permit the police access to \"personal\" letters to his wife. Tests indicated the presumptive presence of blood on one of the husband's forearms on the day of the attack. On the evening of November 17, the police observed garbage bags on the floor of the husband's garage and dark clothing in a clothes dryer. Two wet towels strongly smelling of bleach were found in a plastic bag in the trunk of the husband's car. One of the towels was the same as towels found in the victim's linen closet. The husband explained that the towels smelled because he did not know how to do laundry and had used too much bleach on them. He said he brought them on a hunting trip the previous weekend and had forgotten them in the trunk. Finally, the husband kept wooden baseball bats and other athletic equipment in his garage.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 630 n. 14.</p>\n<p>[14]  Although an analysis under § 2254(d)(1) is appropriate in the present case, we say \"generally\" because we need not conclude that we must \"evaluate a state court's resolution of a <i>Jackson</i> sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim in <i>all</i> cases under § 2254(d)(1) rather than § 2254(d)(2).\" <i>Sarausad v.

Latimore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2083224\"><a href=\"/opinion/2083224/commonwealth-v-latimore/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2083224\"><a href=\"/opinion/2083224/commonwealth-v-latimore/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 375 (1979); <i>see also </i><i>Leftwich,</i> 532 F.3d at 24 (\"Because the <i>Latimore</i> court adopted the governing federal constitutional standard as the Massachusetts standard for sufficiency of the evidence challenges,... we can securely reason that in scouring the record for <i>Latimore</i> error and finding none the SJC effectively answered the federal constitutional question.\") (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>[16]  For example, in <i>Hurtado,</i> we explained:\n</p>\n<p>[A]s a general rule, federal courts should be particularly cautious about issuing habeas, on grounds of the objective unreasonableness of a state court's conclusion that the evidence is sufficient, where there has been a verdict of guilt by a jury of a defendant's peers, where the defendant's credibility was evaluated by the jury hearing his testimony, where that verdict has been affirmed on appeal in the state system, and where there is no claim of constitutional error in the conduct of the trial. Even on direct appeal, claims that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict are \"often made, but rarely successful.\"</p>\n<p>245 F.3d at 19-20 (quoting <i>United States v. Moran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599257\"><a href=\"/opinion/599257/united-states-v-george-a-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1300 (1st Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p>[17]  Like the SJC, we acknowledge that to pass constitutional muster, direct evidence of identification is not necessary. \"Identification can be inferred from all the facts and circumstances that are in evidence.\" <i>Ayala,</i> 289 F.3d at 25 (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>[18]  A reenactment demonstrated that the assailant would not have been able to make out that Whittemore was calling the police.</p>\n<p>[19]  This is not to say that each of us is convinced that the state court's decision is unreasonable in every respect. But this case comes to us on arguments as presented by the parties. This panel may not be in complete unanimity in all particulars, but we do agree that the petitioner has the better of the argument with respect to the means evidence introduced by the prosecution at trial.</p>\n<p>[20]  We compare <i>infra</i> the consciousness of guilt evidence in our case to that of <i>Juan H. v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790372\"><a href=\"/opinion/790372/juan-h-v-walter-allen-iii/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1262</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2005). In <i>Juan H.,</i> the Ninth Circuit granted habeas relief to a petitioner in part because it viewed that any conclusion regarding the petitioner's guilt based on the prosecution's consciousness of guilt evidence amounted to no more than \"bare conjecture.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1277.</p>\n<p>[21]  This is not a case where the defendant stonewalled the police. He approached the police just minutes after the attack, he submitted to a ten-minute interview with the Chief of Police, and ultimately allowed the police to search his apartment.</p>\n<p>[22]  These include:\n</p>\n<p>(1) The focus of the inquiry is on the state court decision;</p>\n<p>(2) Even with the deference due by statute to the state court's determinations, the federal habeas court must itself look to \"the totality of the evidence\" in evaluating the state court's decision;</p>\n<p>(3) The failure of the state court to consider at all a key argument of the defendant may indicate that its conclusion is objectively unreasonable; however, the paucity of reasoning employed by the state court does not itself establish that its result is objectively unreasonable;</p>\n<p>(4) The failure of a state court to give appropriate weight to all of the evidence may mean that its conclusion is objectively unreasonable; and</p>\n<p>(5) The absence of cases of conviction precisely parallel on their facts does not, by itself, establish objective unreasonableness.</p>\n<p><i>Hurtado,</i> 245 F.3d at 18.</p>\n<p>[23]  With respect to the murder weapon, the <i>Newman</i> court acknowledged that \"the prosecution offered ample evidence to support an inference that [the petitioner] had previously possessed at least one of the murder weapons.\" <i>Id.</i> at 795. However, it noted that \"the prosecution did not offer any evidence that [the petitioner] had used or possessed the weapons on the day of the murder,\" any \"eyewitness testimony,\" any \"latent fingerprints from the crime scene or the items in the gym bag\" in which the alleged murder weapon was found. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[24]  Even if, in <i>Newman,</i> the petitioner's motive was anger because the victim had made a pass at the petitioner's girlfriend, the victim's gunshot wound is not inconsistent with this motive.</p>\n<p>[25]  As we stated above, here the SJC viewed its consciousness of guilt evidence to be most probative of O'Laughlin's guilt.</p>\n<p>[26]  As explained above, O'Laughlin's interactions with the police immediately after the assault and the day after, while not irrelevant, did not constitute sufficient evidence for a rational jury, even combined with the other circumstantial evidence, to conclude he was the assailant. Again, it may have been permissible for the jury to find that O'Laughlin possessed consciousness of guilt of some crime, such as drug possession, for which the evidence showed there was some basis, but not of a vicious attack on a neighbor with whom he had very little prior contact.</p>\n<p>[27]  O'Laughlin also claims that the SJC, in concluding that the trial judge properly excluded a note O'Laughlin alleged to have supported his third-party culprit defense, violated his constitutional right to present a defense. In view of our holding regarding O'Laughlin's <i>Jackson</i> claim, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n\n</div>",
