Flaherty  and  Wolf, Block,  Schorr and  Solis-Cohen  on\n                                                                  \nbrief for appellee Israel Roizman.\n\n                                             \n\n                                             \n\n    Per Curiam.     On  March  7,  1991,  appellant Peter  Grabler,  a\n              \n\nresident of  Massachusetts, filed a complaint  against appellee Israel\n\nRoizman, a  resident  of  Pennsylvania.   Jurisdiction  was  based  on\n\ndiversity of citizenship.   Grabler essentially  claimed that  Roizman\n\nhad breached an agreement to  purchase all of Grabler's  shareholdings\n\nin  Benchmark  Broadway  Corporation and  Benchmark  Developers,  Inc.\n\nAmong other  forms of relief, Grabler  requested damages (unspecified)\n\nand  an accounting.   He  also included  allegations that  Roizman had\n\ncommitted fraud, engaged in economic duress and had violated M.G.L. c.\n\n93A and Section  10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the  1934 Securities Exchange\n\nAct.   The details  of the complaint  are not relevant  to this appeal\n\nbecause Roizman  agreed to pay  Grabler approximately $96,000  for the\n\nstock.\n\n    In May  1991, Roizman  filed an  answer and  a counterclaim.   The\n\ncounterclaim,  which  essentially forms  the  basis  for this  appeal,\n\nconcerns  the  deterioration  in  the  business  relationships   among\n\nGrabler,  Roizman  and  a third  person,  David  Kohen.   These  three\n\nindividuals  are  the  sole   shareholders  in  Benchmark   Properties\n\nCorporation (\"Benchmark\").*   Benchmark  is  in the  business of  real\n\nestate  development.   Specifically, it  is a  general partner  in two\n\nhousing projects -- Elm Hill Limited Partnership (\"Elm Hill\") and Blue\n\nHill  Limited Partnership (\"Blue Hill\").  Benchmark has a 50% interest\n\nin each project.   The other general partners are  Benchmark Financial\n\nGroup, Ltd. (\"BFGL\")  and an  individual, Frank Jones.   Each  project\n\nalso has a  limited partnership as  its limited partner.   Grabler and\n\nKohen are the sole shareholders of BFGL.\n\n                    \n\n*Grabler and  Kohen  are  directors of  Benchmark;  Roizman  holds  no\noffice.  All  decisions concerning  Benchmark must be  by a  unanimous\nvote of the three shareholders.\n\n    In June 1991, the parties reached a  final settlement and the case\n\nwas dismissed.   Paragraphs 2 through 4 of the  settlement concern how\n\nmuch Roizman  owed Grabler for the stock  purchase and how Roizman was\n\nto effect payment to Grabler.  Paragraph 7 of the settlement stated:\n\n    After Grabler  and Roizman have  reached agreement  regarding\n    the allocation  of expenses and partnership  distributions in\n    connection  with Elm  Hill Housing Limited  Partnership, Blue\n    Hill  Housing Limited  Partnership and  Benchmark Properties,\n    Inc., Grabler  shall add Roizman  as a required  signatory on\n    the  Massachusetts escrow  account, as  well as  all savings,\n    checking and other  banking accounts maintained  by Elm  Hill\n    Housing  Limited  Partnership,   Blue  Hill  Housing  Limited\n    Partnership  and  Benchmark  Properties, Inc.    Grabler  and\n    Roizman  agree that they will proceed in good faith to affect\n    [sic] a resolution of this issue.\n\nUnfortunately, the obligation to  use good faith failed to  ensure the\n\nsettlement  of  the  disputes  concerning  Elm  Hill,  Blue  Hill  and\n\nBenchmark  pursuant to  the  above paragraph.    Also in  dispute  was\n\nwhether  Grabler was  due  interest  on  the  payment  for  the  stock\n\npurchased by Roizman.   Thus, on October 15, 1991,  the district court\n\ngranted Roizman's motion to reopen and set the case for hearing.\n\n    The specific  claims presented  at that  time by  Roizman were  as\n\nfollows:  (1) Grabler and Kohen caused Benchmark to pay all of certain\n                                                           \n\nexpenses incurred by  Blue Hill and  Elm Hill, despite  the fact  that\n\nBenchmark only had a fifty percent  interest in each project, and  the\n                                  \n\nexcess costs  should be deducted from the profits of Blue Hill and Elm\n\nHill; (2) Grabler and  Kohen each received salaries from  Benchmark to\n\nwhich they were not entitled and, having reimbursed Benchmark for part\n\nof the salaries, still owed  Benchmark approximately $23,000; (3) Blue\n\nHill incurred  expenses for deleading  and $18,200  of these  expenses\n\nwere  \"double deducted\" from the  profits of Blue  Hill; (4) Benchmark\n\npaid  for Grabler's  personal phone  calls in  an estimated  amount of\n\n$2563;  and (5)  Benchmark,  at  the  end  of  1989,  had  $50,529  in\n\n                                  3\n\ndevelopment  cash (profits  from both  Elm Hill  and Blue  Hill) which\n\nshould have been  distributed to the  Benchmark shareholders,  Roizman\n\nbeing entitled to one-third of that amount.\n\n    The district court ultimately  found in Roizman's  favor on  these\n\nfive  claims,  holding that  he \"is  owed the  sum  of $37,335  as the\n\nappropriate allocation  of expenses  and partnership  distributions in\n\nconnection  with Elm  Hill  Housing  LP,  Blue  Hill  Housing  LP  and\n\nBenchmark Properties  Corporation  (\"BPC\") .  . .  .\"   See Order  and\n                                                           \n\nJudgment,   2.  This order also provided that\n\n    [s]ubject  to  making  provision  for  the  payment  of   the\n    reasonable  expenses  of  BPC  in  the  ordinary  course   of\n    business, Peter Grabler  and Israel Roizman  are directed  to\n    take  all appropriate action to effect  the prompt payment of\n    $37,335 to  Israel Roizman  from the future  profits of  BPC,\n    such payments to  be arranged in such fashion as  to have the\n    same  economic effect as if  these payments had  been made in\n    the ordinary course.\n\nId.   3.  The judgment finally stated that if Grabler and Roizman were\n   \n\nnot able to  agree on  a method to  effect the payment  of $37,335  to\n\nRoizman, the court  would appoint an independent auditor  to recommend\n\nhow the payment should be made.  Id.   4.\n                                    \n\n                                  4\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n                                        \n\n    Grabler attacks the district court's findings  on four out of  the\n\nfive  claims asserted  by Roizman.**   He also  argues that  he should\n\nhave been awarded  interest on the $96,000  owed to him  for Roizman's\n\nfailure to  pay for the stock.  We review the district court's factual\n\nfindings under the clearly erroneous standard.\n\n    \"If the district court's account of the evidence is plausible\n    in light of  the record viewed in its entirety,  the court of\n    appeals  may not reverse it even though convinced that had it\n    been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have  weighed the\n    evidence differently.  Where there are two permissible  views\n    of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them  cannot\n    be clearly erroneous.\"\n\nAnderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., 900 F.2d 388, 392  (1st Cir.) (quoting\n                             \n\nAnderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985)), cert.\n                                                                     \n\ndenied., 111 S.Ct. 233 (1990).  In this case, which depends heavily on\n      \n\nthe inferences to be drawn from conflicting views of the facts, we may\n\nnot substitute our opinion  as to conclusions reached by  the district\n\ncourt absent clear  error.    Id. at  392.  Keeping  this standard  in\n                                \n\nmind, we turn to the disputed findings.\n\n    A.  The Counterclaims\n                         \n\n    1.   Roizman asserts  that during 1988,  1989  and  1990 Benchmark\n\nincurred certain expenses connected with its operation of Elm Hill and\n\nBlue  Hill.  Pages D, E  and F of Trial Exhibit  6 reflect these costs\n\nfor each year.   In total,  Benchmark paid $221,454  for the years  in\n\nquestion.   Roizman's basic claim  is that Benchmark  should have been\n\n                    \n\n**  Grabler  does  not  challenge  on  appeal   the  district  court's\nconclusion that, at the end of 1989, Benchmark should have distributed\nto  the shareholders $50,529 as profits.   Issues not raised on appeal\nare waived. Cf. Pignons S.A. de  Mecanique v. Polaroid Corp., 701 F.2d\n                                                           \n1, 3  (1st  Cir. 1983)  (issues  not presented  in initial  brief  are\nwaived).  As for Grabler's contention that Roizman did not have \"clean\nhands,\" it  was not  raised below  and  is thus  forfeited on  review.\nJohnston v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 595 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir. 1979).\n                             \n\n                                  5\n\ncharged  for only  half of  this amount  because it  only had  a fifty\n\npercent  interest in each  project.  That  is, Elm Hill  and Blue Hill\n\nshould have absorbed  half of  these expenses.   As Roizman  explained\n\nduring trial:  \n\n    The basis is  as follow[s]:   When  in this  industry of  low\n    income housing  when you have a  partnership [Benchmark] that\n    operates two projects, and that's it, and this partnership is\n    supposed to  get income for  management fee[s], but  does not\n    receive any management fee because the project is not healthy\n    financially to  pay  the  management  fee, and  there  is  an\n    expense of rent, taxes, interest, copying, office supply, and\n    everything else  that shows in RD,  E and F.   When you don't\n    have an income  to this  project, to this  company, there  is\n    someplace where  the money has to be paid from.  And the only\n    place where the  money can be paid is from  profit that comes\n    in from the two entities and that's Elm Hill and Blue Hill.\n\nApp. I, Tab 1, at 40. \n\n    As  a result,  Roizman  concludes,  the  profits of  both  limited\n\npartnerships should  have been reduced  by their respective  shares of\n\nthe $221,454  in expenses incurred by Benchmark.  Accordingly, Note #1\n\non page A  of Trial Exhibit 6  reflects a deduction in the  profits of\n\nBlue Hill of $112,942.  Similarly, Note #1 of page B of Trial  Exhibit\n\n6 shows a reduction in Elm Hill's profits of $108,512.***\n\n    Grabler  claims  that  these calculations  are  wrong.   He  first\n\nargues that because Benchmark was running projects in addition to Blue\n\nHill and Elm Hill, see Trial Exhibit 6, at pages J  and K, these other\n                      \n\nprojects also should have absorbed some of Benchmark's costs. Although\n\nnot entirely clear, Roizman's accountant, Stuart Briefer (who also had\n\nbeen  the  accountant for  Benchmark  and  the limited  partnerships),\n\ntestified  that the costs  listed in Trial  Exhibit 6 were  not all of\n                                                                   \n\nBenchmark's costs  for the  years 1988-1990.   App. I,  Tab 2,  at 64.\n\n                    \n\n***Although Benchmark has  a fifty percent  interest in each  project,\nBlue  Hill was charged with fifty-one percent of Benchmark's costs and\nElm Hill was charged  forty-nine percent. There is no  explanation for\nthis difference but, in any event, it is not challenged on appeal.\n\n                                  6\n\nRather, the  inference from the testimony is that the amounts on pages\n\nD, E and F were Benchmark expenses that related solely to Elm Hill and\n                                                      \n\nBlue Hill.  Id.  at 64-65.  Grabler  did not submit any  evidence that\n              \n\nwould contradict Briefer's testimony.**** \n\n    Next, Grabler contends that  an independent auditor's  report, see\n                                                                      \n\nApp. III, Tab 7, at 7 and Tab 8, at 9, demonstrates that Blue Hill and\n\nElm  Hill  each   paid  about   $57,811  for   their  own   respective\n\norganizational   costs.    However,  Grabler  did  not  point  to  any\n\ndocumentary  or other evidence that  this money was  spent on the same\n\nitems listed on pages D, E and F of Trial Exhibit 6.  Indeed, there is\n\nno explanation concerning exactly how the independent auditor's report\n\nrelates to the payment of Benchmark's expenses. \n                                     \n\n    Grabler also  alleges that Benchmark  in fact  received income  in\n\nthe form of management fees for 1988-1990, but assigned this income to\n\nanother company,  Benchmark Apartment  Management  Corp.   As  Grabler\n\nnever put in evidence any agreements concerning the assignment of such\n\nfees or any documents indicating the dollar amounts of these fees,  we\n\ncannot say that the district court's decision to credit Roizman's view\n\nof the evidence was plainly wrong.\n\n    2.   Roizman claims that $18,200  -- which reflects  a payment for\n\ndeleading at the Blue Hill housing project -- was erroneously \"double-\n\ndeducted\" from the profits of Blue Hill.  Thus, as reflected on page A\n\nof  Trial Exhibit  6, $18,200  was added  to  the calculation  of Blue\n\nHill's profits.  To support his position, Roizman relies on a document\n\nentitled \"Calculation of Syndication Profits,\"  Exhibit RO, #5, and  a\n\n                    \n\n****Similarly, Grabler's claim that there were no charges for ordinary\nexpenses  such  as telephone,  rent and  copying  listed on  the pages\nconcerning these other projects seems irrelevant, without more, to the\nquestion  whether Elm Hill and Blue Hill should have been charged with\nsome of Benchmark's expenses.\n\n                                  7\n\nrecord  of  Syndication Account  Transactions  for Blue  Hill.   Trial\n\nExhibit 7, at 4.  \n\n    It is  undisputed that Blue Hill  has two  accounts -- syndication\n\nand operations.   Under  this arrangement,  the operations account  is\n\nfunded by the syndication account.  It also is undisputed that most of\n\nthe expenses for the deleading were paid from the syndication account,\n\nexcept  for the  $18,200 which,  for some  reason, was  paid  from the\n\noperations account.  According to Briefer's testimony, in  calculating\n\nBlue  Hill's profits,  one  of the  expenses  listed in  RO  #5 is  an\n\n\"operating deficit\" of $75,000.   App. I, Tab 3, at 17-19 and App. II,\n\nTab 1, at 17-20.  However, this deficit was reduced  by $18,200 -- the\n\namount  for  deleading  which had  been  paid  out  of the  operations\n                                                                      \n\naccount.  Id.\n            \n\n    Although not free from doubt, it  appears that Roizman is  arguing\n\nthat the \"double deduction\"  occurred when $75,000 was wired  from the\n\nsyndication account to the  operations account in December 1990.   See\n                                                                      \n\nTrial  Exhibit 7, at  4.  Briefer  testified that only  $56,800 should\n\nhave been transferred.   App. I, Tab 2, at 61.   As a result, not only\n\ndid  the  operations account  lay out  $18,200  for deleading,  but by\n\ntransferring the  full  $75,000,  the  syndication  account  also  was\n\ncharged $18,200.  \n\n    Grabler  first argues  that  Exhibit  RO  was  never  admitted  in\n\nevidence  and that,  in any event,  it was \"superseded\"  by Exhibit 7.\n\nExhibit RO  contains the underlying documents from which Trial Exhibit\n\n6 was prepared  by Roizman and  Briefer.  The district  court admitted\n\nExhibit 6 in evidence on the second day  of trial.  App. I, Tab 2,  at\n\n32.  It later described RO as \"part of exhibit 6,\"   App. I, Tab 2, at\n\n59, and referred to it during the course of the trial.  As such, it is\n\n                                  8\n\nplain that RO was considered  as admitted in evidence by  the district\n\ncourt.  \n\n    As for Exhibit 7,  it is a  memorandum, dated September 20,  1991,\n\nfrom Kohen to  Roizman.  Page 4 reflects Blue Hill syndication account\n\ntransactions for 1990  and 1991.   Grabler points  out that Exhibit  7\n\ndoes not list  $18,200 as a deduction.  He  then makes the observation\n\nthat  RO #5  reflects  only an  \"estimate\"  of Blue  Hill  syndication\n\nprofits.   From this  he concludes that the  $18,200 was accounted for\n\nonly once -- when it was paid out from the operations account.\n\n    Based on  the evidence and testimony,  we think  that the district\n\ncourt's  decision  to credit  Roizman's  explanation  was not  clearly\n\nerroneous.  Exhibit RO  #5 was prepared on February 8,  1991.  At this\n\ntime,  the  operations  account  already  had  paid  the  $18,200  for\n\ndeleading.  Indeed, according to Grabler, the  operations account paid\n\nthis amount in December 1990.  This is the same time that $75,000 from\n\nthe  syndication account  was wired  to the  operations account.   See\n                                                                      \n\nTrial  Exhibit  7, at  4.    To  this  extent,  it  appears  that  the\n\ncalculation concerning the operations deficit of $56,800 (the  $75,000\n\nminus $18,200) is not an estimate.\n\n    3.  Roizman's  claim that Grabler  and Kohen  agreed to return  to\n\nBenchmark  salaries  they  had  received  is  well  supported  by  the\n\nevidence.  In fact, in his brief, Grabler candidly admits  that he and\n\nKohen \"repaid all but $7,800  of the salary they had each  received in\n\n1989\"   to  Benchmark.*****     Appellant's   Brief,  at  33.     This\n\nadmission lends direct support to Roizman's  contention that Kohen and\n\n                    \n\n*****  Grabler's  argument  that he  and  Kohen  each retained  $7,800\nbecause  Roizman allegedly  received  $7,800 in  extra  salary is  not\nrelevant  to the  question whether  an agreement  concerning repayment\nexisted.\n\n                                  9\n\nGrabler had, in fact, agreed  to repay the salaries they  had received\n\nin 1989.  In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the district\n\ncourt's finding that Benchmark still is owed approximately $23,000 for\n\nsalary reimbursement is not clearly erroneous.\n\n    4.    Roizman claims  that  during 1988,  1989  and part  of  1990\n\nGrabler charged all of  his personal calls  to Benchmark.  To  support\n\nthis assertion, Roizman submitted four cellular  one phone bills dated\n\nNovember  11, 1988, January  8, 1989,  July 6,  1989 and  September 7,\n\n1989.  According to Briefer's testimony,  see App. I, Tab 1, at 65-70,\n                                             \n\nhe  reviewed  the above  bills,  identified  Grabler's personal  phone\n\ncharges,  added them  up,  determined an  average  monthly figure  and\n\nmultiplied  it by  the number  of  covered months.   Page  L of  Trial\n\nExhibit 6 contains Briefer's  calculations.  It reveals that  based on\n\nthe four phone  bills, the average  amount of personal phone  calls is\n\n$82.66.  Thus,  for the period June  1988 to December  1990, Benchmark\n\nallegedly  paid  approximately  $2,563  for  Grabler's  personal phone\n\ncalls.   Page H of Trial Exhibit 6,  which contains the summary of how\n\nthe profits of Benchmark should  be adjusted, therefore indicates that\n\nGrabler owes Benchmark $2563.  Grabler  first  argues  that the  claim\n\nmust fail because the telephone bills should not have been admitted in\n\nevidence under Fed. R.  Evid. 1006 (admission of summaries).   Second,\n\nhe  points  out that  Briefer testified  that  he had  no recollection\n\nconcerning whether Benchmark actually  had paid these bills.   App. I,\n\nTab 3, at 25.  Indeed, Briefer  stated that he could not \"recall  what\n\nentity paid  for the  bills.\"  Id.   We believe  that, even  under the\n                                 \n\nclearly  erroneous standard, this claim  must fail.   Therefore, we do\n\nnot address the evidentiary question.\n\n                                  10\n\n    Simply stated,  how much  Roizman might  be due  in damages  would\n\ndepend  on  which entity  paid the  phone  bills.   Assuming Roizman's\n\nfigures are accurate, and Grabler owes Benchmark $2,563, Roizman might\n\nbe  entitled to recover as much as  one-third.  However, if Blue Hill,\n\nElm Hill or some  other entity paid these bills, the  $2,563 repayment\n\nwould not  go directly to Benchmark.   As a result,  Roizman would not\n\nreceive  one-third.  For example,  if one of  the limited partnerships\n\npaid the phone bills, Grabler would reimburse the limited partnership,\n\nand Benchmark, as a fifty percent  owner, might be entitled to as much\n\nas one-half of $2,563 or $1,281.50.   Roizman's share would be reduced\n\nto approximately  $427.  As  Roizman failed to establish  who paid the\n\nphone bills, on the present  record it is impossible to  calculate the\n\namount of any damages due.\n\n    B.  Interest on the Stock Transaction\n                                         \n\n    The final order of the district  court regarding the  disbursement\n\nof  the  purchase price  of  the stock  (which  had been  held  in the\n\nregistry  of  the   district  court),  stated,   subject  to   certain\n\npreconditions not relevant to this appeal, that\n\n    the sum of $96,333.84 shall be released by the Clerk from the\n    Registry of  this Court to Peter  Grabler, representing final\n                                                                 \n    payment  to Grabler  for his  100 shares  of common  stock of\n           \n    Benchmark  Broadway  Corporation  and  Benchmark  Developers,\n    Inc., each,  pursuant to  paragraph 2 of  the Stipulation  of\n    6/28/91. \n\nOrder of  Court, dated November 1991,  reproduced in App.  III, Tab 17\n\n(emphasis added).  \n\n    Grabler  argues that  the  November  1991  Order only  applies  to\n\nparagraph 2  -- the  underlying obligation  of Roizman  concerning the\n\npurchase  price for  the stock  -- and  not to  paragraph 5  which, he\n\n                                  11\n\nasserts, addresses interest on the purchase price.  Grabler also avers\n\nthat contrary to  Roizman's statement in Roizman's  draft order (which\n\nthe  district court adopted) he (Grabler) never agreed to the language\n\nin  Roizman's draft.   Grabler  points  out that  the  draft order  he\n\nsubmitted  to the court,  App. III, Tab  18, did not  specify that the\n\n$96,000 was a \"final payment.\"\n\n    We are  unable to ascertain any basis in the  record for Grabler's\n\nclaim that  he is due  interest on  the purchase price  for the  stock\n\nnotwithstanding    the   final    judgment    of   the    court.******\n\nSpecifically, he  has not  carried  his burden  of demonstrating  that\n\nparagraph 5 of the June Stipulation applied to the stock purchase.  In\n\nany event,  it is not  clear from the  record how such  interest would\n\nhave been calculated and Grabler, in support of his claim to interest,\n\nhas not even established  the period during which such  interest would\n\nhave  accrued.  Consequently, we decline to disturb the final judgment\n\nof the district court regarding this claim.       C. Rule 19 \n                                                            \n\n    Grabler finally  argues on appeal  that the  district court failed\n\nto join Kohen,  Benchmark, Blue  Hill, Elm Hill,  BFGL, Jones and  the\n\nlimited  partners of Blue Hill  and Elm Hill  as indispensable parties\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 19.   We note in this context that Grabler never\n\nfiled a Rule  19 motion for joinder.  Nonetheless,  the district court\n\nwas  aware that  it had  only Grabler  and Roizman  before it  when it\n\nentered judgment and acknowledged that it was directing enforcement of\n\n                    \n\n******Indeed,  the only  reference  the  district  court  made  to  an\ninterest claim by Grabler was its  statement that it was not persuaded\nthat  Roizman was required  to pay  interest on  the sum  of $102,441.\nApp. II,  Tab 2, at 101, which amount appears to relate to the Flipper\nTemple deal  in  Atlanta, not  the  stock purchase  agreement  between\nGrabler and Roizman.\n\n                                  12\n\nthe  June  stipulation  between  Grabler  and  Roizman.*******     For\n\nthe reasons stated below,  it would be premature to  address Grabler's\n\nRule 19 claim at the present time.\n\n    First,  Grabler specifically  promised  to exercise  \"good  faith\"\n\nefforts to  reach an \"agreement  regarding the allocation  of expenses\n\nand partnership distributions\"  in connection with  Benchmark and  the\n\nlimited  partnerships.  June  Stipulation,   7.   He  entered into the\n\nstipulation, which  the court  treated as  an enforceable  contract at\n\ntrial, knowing that  the resolution of  the accounting disputes  might\n\nrequire action on behalf of Benchmark, Blue Hill, Elm Hill and others.\n\n    Second,  after both Grabler  and Roizman  filed post-trial motions\n\n                    \n\n*          *          *          *          *          *          *\n    Now,  it's important to understand that  there are before the\n    Court  only Mr.  Grabler  and  Mr.  Roizman.    None  of  the\n    corporations  have been  joined and  Mr. Kohen  has  not been\n    joined.  The Court infers, but  makes no finding, that one of\n    the reasons  these  parties were  not enjoined  was it  would\n    destroy the  diversity jurisdiction . . .  which is necessary\n    for this  Court to act  and the disputes  arising out of  the\n    settlement agreements  would then have  to be disposed  of in\n    the state court.\n\nApp.  II,  Tab 2,  at 94.    As for  Grabler's  ability to  effect the\njudgment, the district court stated:\n\n    [W]hile  it's certainly  appropriate  for me  to resolve  all\n    matters  as between  Mr. Grabler  and Mr. Roizman  and indeed\n    equitably  to make sure that those two parties who are before\n    the  Court give  effect to  the Court's  judgment, I  have no\n    right to enter orders, nor have I yet entered . . . any order\n    against Mr. Kohen. . . .\n\n                               . . . .\n\n    So,  I  can  imagine   saying,  and  correct  me,  that   the\n    accountings  shall be  as  I decreed  them  and I  order  the\n    parties before the  Court to  give effect  to the  accounting\n    resolution that I have made and leave it at that.\n\nId. at 67.\n   \n\n                                  13\n\nrequesting enforcement  of the court's final  order, Roizman's counsel\n\nfiled a letter  with the court indicating that \"the  parties have been\n\nable to agree in  [sic] the manner in  which to carry out  the Court's\n\nOrder.\"   Thus, it appears that the  means are available with which to\n\nenable Grabler  to effect payment  to Roizman.   Even if  any Rule  19\n\nclaim has not been waived, it  clearly was not addressed below, and is\n\nunripe for review.  For the present, therefore, issues relating to the\n\nenforcement of the district court order are properly presented to that\n\ncourt in the first instance.\n\n    For the  foregoing reasons, the case  is remanded  to the district\n                                                                      \n\ncourt  for further  proceedings  consistent with  this  opinion.   The\n                                                                      \n\njudgment of the  district court  is affirmed, except  as concerns  the\n                                                                      \n\naward of $2,563 to Roizman.  SO ORDERED.\n                                       \n\n                                  14\n",

Flaherty  and  Wolf, Block,  Schorr and  Solis-Cohen  on\n                                                                  \nbrief for appellee Israel Roizman.\n\n                                             \n\n                                             \n\n    Per Curiam.     On  March  7,  1991,  appellant Peter  Grabler,  a\n              \n\nresident of  Massachusetts, filed a complaint  against appellee Israel\n\nRoizman, a  resident  of  Pennsylvania.   Jurisdiction  was  based  on\n\ndiversity of citizenship.   Grabler essentially  claimed that  Roizman\n\nhad breached an agreement to  purchase all of Grabler's  shareholdings\n\nin  Benchmark  Broadway  Corporation and  Benchmark  Developers,  Inc.\n\nAmong other  forms of relief, Grabler  requested damages (unspecified)\n\nand  an accounting.   He  also included  allegations that  Roizman had\n\ncommitted fraud, engaged in economic duress and had violated M.G.L. c.\n\n93A and Section  10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the  1934 Securities Exchange\n\nAct.   The details  of the complaint  are not relevant  to this appeal\n\nbecause Roizman  agreed to pay  Grabler approximately $96,000  for the\n\nstock.\n\n    In May  1991, Roizman  filed an  answer and  a counterclaim.   The\n\ncounterclaim,  which  essentially forms  the  basis  for this  appeal,\n\nconcerns  the  deterioration  in  the  business  relationships   among\n\nGrabler,  Roizman  and  a third  person,  David  Kohen.   These  three\n\nindividuals  are  the  sole   shareholders  in  Benchmark   Properties\n\nCorporation (\"Benchmark\").*   Benchmark  is  in the  business of  real\n\nestate  development.   Specifically, it  is a  general partner  in two\n\nhousing projects -- Elm Hill Limited Partnership (\"Elm Hill\") and Blue\n\nHill  Limited Partnership (\"Blue Hill\").  Benchmark has a 50% interest\n\nin each project.   The other general partners are  Benchmark Financial\n\nGroup, Ltd. (\"BFGL\")  and an  individual, Frank Jones.   Each  project\n\nalso has a  limited partnership as  its limited partner.   Grabler and\n\nKohen are the sole shareholders of BFGL.\n\n                    \n\n*Grabler and  Kohen  are  directors of  Benchmark;  Roizman  holds  no\noffice.  All  decisions concerning  Benchmark must be  by a  unanimous\nvote of the three shareholders.\n\n    In June 1991, the parties reached a  final settlement and the case\n\nwas dismissed.   Paragraphs 2 through 4 of the  settlement concern how\n\nmuch Roizman  owed Grabler for the stock  purchase and how Roizman was\n\nto effect payment to Grabler.  Paragraph 7 of the settlement stated:\n\n    After Grabler  and Roizman have  reached agreement  regarding\n    the allocation  of expenses and partnership  distributions in\n    connection  with Elm  Hill Housing Limited  Partnership, Blue\n    Hill  Housing Limited  Partnership and  Benchmark Properties,\n    Inc., Grabler  shall add Roizman  as a required  signatory on\n    the  Massachusetts escrow  account, as  well as  all savings,\n    checking and other  banking accounts maintained  by Elm  Hill\n    Housing  Limited  Partnership,   Blue  Hill  Housing  Limited\n    Partnership  and  Benchmark  Properties, Inc.    Grabler  and\n    Roizman  agree that they will proceed in good faith to affect\n    [sic] a resolution of this issue.\n\nUnfortunately, the obligation to  use good faith failed to  ensure the\n\nsettlement  of  the  disputes  concerning  Elm  Hill,  Blue  Hill  and\n\nBenchmark  pursuant to  the  above paragraph.    Also in  dispute  was\n\nwhether  Grabler was  due  interest  on  the  payment  for  the  stock\n\npurchased by Roizman.   Thus, on October 15, 1991,  the district court\n\ngranted Roizman's motion to reopen and set the case for hearing.\n\n    The specific  claims presented  at that  time by  Roizman were  as\n\nfollows:  (1) Grabler and Kohen caused Benchmark to pay all of certain\n                                                           \n\nexpenses incurred by  Blue Hill and  Elm Hill, despite  the fact  that\n\nBenchmark only had a fifty percent  interest in each project, and  the\n                                  \n\nexcess costs  should be deducted from the profits of Blue Hill and Elm\n\nHill; (2) Grabler and  Kohen each received salaries from  Benchmark to\n\nwhich they were not entitled and, having reimbursed Benchmark for part\n\nof the salaries, still owed  Benchmark approximately $23,000; (3) Blue\n\nHill incurred  expenses for deleading  and $18,200  of these  expenses\n\nwere  \"double deducted\" from the  profits of Blue  Hill; (4) Benchmark\n\npaid  for Grabler's  personal phone  calls in  an estimated  amount of\n\n$2563;  and (5)  Benchmark,  at  the  end  of  1989,  had  $50,529  in\n\n                                  3\n\ndevelopment  cash (profits  from both  Elm Hill  and Blue  Hill) which\n\nshould have been  distributed to the  Benchmark shareholders,  Roizman\n\nbeing entitled to one-third of that amount.\n\n    The district court ultimately  found in Roizman's  favor on  these\n\nfive  claims,  holding that  he \"is  owed the  sum  of $37,335  as the\n\nappropriate allocation  of expenses  and partnership  distributions in\n\nconnection  with Elm  Hill  Housing  LP,  Blue  Hill  Housing  LP  and\n\nBenchmark Properties  Corporation  (\"BPC\") .  . .  .\"   See Order  and\n                                                           \n\nJudgment,   2.  This order also provided that\n\n    [s]ubject  to  making  provision  for  the  payment  of   the\n    reasonable  expenses  of  BPC  in  the  ordinary  course   of\n    business, Peter Grabler  and Israel Roizman  are directed  to\n    take  all appropriate action to effect  the prompt payment of\n    $37,335 to  Israel Roizman  from the future  profits of  BPC,\n    such payments to  be arranged in such fashion as  to have the\n    same  economic effect as if  these payments had  been made in\n    the ordinary course.\n\nId.   3.  The judgment finally stated that if Grabler and Roizman were\n   \n\nnot able to  agree on  a method to  effect the payment  of $37,335  to\n\nRoizman, the court  would appoint an independent auditor  to recommend\n\nhow the payment should be made.  Id.   4.\n                                    \n\n                                  4\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n                                        \n\n    Grabler attacks the district court's findings  on four out of  the\n\nfive  claims asserted  by Roizman.**   He also  argues that  he should\n\nhave been awarded  interest on the $96,000  owed to him  for Roizman's\n\nfailure to  pay for the stock.  We review the district court's factual\n\nfindings under the clearly erroneous standard.\n\n    \"If the district court's account of the evidence is plausible\n    in light of  the record viewed in its entirety,  the court of\n    appeals  may not reverse it even though convinced that had it\n    been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have  weighed the\n    evidence differently.  Where there are two permissible  views\n    of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them  cannot\n    be clearly erroneous.\"\n\nAnderson v.

Pages D, E  and F of Trial Exhibit  6 reflect these costs\n\nfor each year.   In total,  Benchmark paid $221,454  for the years  in\n\nquestion.   Roizman's basic claim  is that Benchmark  should have been\n\n                    \n\n**  Grabler  does  not  challenge  on  appeal   the  district  court's\nconclusion that, at the end of 1989, Benchmark should have distributed\nto  the shareholders $50,529 as profits.

That  is, Elm Hill  and Blue Hill\n\nshould have absorbed  half of  these expenses.   As Roizman  explained\n\nduring trial:  \n\n    The basis is  as follow[s]:   When  in this  industry of  low\n    income housing  when you have a  partnership [Benchmark] that\n    operates two projects, and that's it, and this partnership is\n    supposed to  get income for  management fee[s], but  does not\n    receive any management fee because the project is not healthy\n    financially to  pay  the  management  fee, and  there  is  an\n    expense of rent, taxes, interest, copying, office supply, and\n    everything else  that shows in RD,  E and F.   When you don't\n    have an income  to this  project, to this  company, there  is\n    someplace where  the money has to be paid from.  And the only\n    place where the  money can be paid is from  profit that comes\n    in from the two entities and that's Elm Hill and Blue Hill.\n\nApp. I, Tab 1, at 40. \n\n    As  a result,  Roizman  concludes,  the  profits of  both  limited\n\npartnerships should  have been reduced  by their respective  shares of\n\nthe $221,454  in expenses incurred by Benchmark.  Accordingly, Note #1\n\non page A  of Trial Exhibit 6  reflects a deduction in the  profits of\n\nBlue Hill of $112,942.  Similarly, Note #1 of page B of Trial  Exhibit\n\n6 shows a reduction in Elm Hill's profits of $108,512.***\n\n    Grabler  claims  that  these calculations  are  wrong.   He  first\n\nargues that because Benchmark was running projects in addition to Blue\n\nHill and Elm Hill, see Trial Exhibit 6, at pages J  and K, these other\n                      \n\nprojects also should have absorbed some of Benchmark's costs. Although\n\nnot entirely clear, Roizman's accountant, Stuart Briefer (who also had\n\nbeen  the  accountant for  Benchmark  and  the limited  partnerships),\n\ntestified  that the costs  listed in Trial  Exhibit 6 were  not all of\n                                                                   \n\nBenchmark's costs  for the  years 1988-1990.   App. I,  Tab 2,  at 64.\n\n                    \n\n***Although Benchmark has  a fifty percent  interest in each  project,\nBlue  Hill was charged with fifty-one percent of Benchmark's costs and\nElm Hill was charged  forty-nine percent. There is no  explanation for\nthis difference but, in any event, it is not challenged on appeal.\n\n                                  6\n\nRather, the  inference from the testimony is that the amounts on pages\n\nD, E and F were Benchmark expenses that related solely to Elm Hill and\n                                                      \n\nBlue Hill.  Id.  at 64-65.  Grabler  did not submit any  evidence that\n              \n\nwould contradict Briefer's testimony.**** \n\n    Next, Grabler contends that  an independent auditor's  report, see\n                                                                      \n\nApp. III, Tab 7, at 7 and Tab 8, at 9, demonstrates that Blue Hill and\n\nElm  Hill  each   paid  about   $57,811  for   their  own   respective\n\norganizational   costs.    However,  Grabler  did  not  point  to  any\n\ndocumentary  or other evidence that  this money was  spent on the same\n\nitems listed on pages D, E and F of Trial Exhibit 6.  Indeed, there is\n\nno explanation concerning exactly how the independent auditor's report\n\nrelates to the payment of Benchmark's expenses. \n                                     \n\n    Grabler also  alleges that Benchmark  in fact  received income  in\n\nthe form of management fees for 1988-1990, but assigned this income to\n\nanother company,  Benchmark Apartment  Management  Corp.   As  Grabler\n\nnever put in evidence any agreements concerning the assignment of such\n\nfees or any documents indicating the dollar amounts of these fees,  we\n\ncannot say that the district court's decision to credit Roizman's view\n\nof the evidence was plainly wrong.\n\n    2.   Roizman claims that $18,200  -- which reflects  a payment for\n\ndeleading at the Blue Hill housing project -- was erroneously \"double-\n\ndeducted\" from the profits of Blue Hill.  Thus, as reflected on page A\n\nof  Trial Exhibit  6, $18,200  was added  to  the calculation  of Blue\n\nHill's profits.  To support his position, Roizman relies on a document\n\nentitled \"Calculation of Syndication Profits,\"  Exhibit RO, #5, and  a\n\n                    \n\n****Similarly, Grabler's claim that there were no charges for ordinary\nexpenses  such  as telephone,  rent and  copying  listed on  the pages\nconcerning these other projects seems irrelevant, without more, to the\nquestion  whether Elm Hill and Blue Hill should have been charged with\nsome of Benchmark's expenses.\n\n                                  7\n\nrecord  of  Syndication Account  Transactions  for Blue  Hill.   Trial\n\nExhibit 7, at 4.  \n\n    It is  undisputed that Blue Hill  has two  accounts -- syndication\n\nand operations.   Under  this arrangement,  the operations account  is\n\nfunded by the syndication account.  It also is undisputed that most of\n\nthe expenses for the deleading were paid from the syndication account,\n\nexcept  for the  $18,200 which,  for some  reason, was  paid  from the\n\noperations account.  According to Briefer's testimony, in  calculating\n\nBlue  Hill's profits,  one  of the  expenses  listed in  RO  #5 is  an\n\n\"operating deficit\" of $75,000.   App. I, Tab 3, at 17-19 and App. II,\n\nTab 1, at 17-20.  However, this deficit was reduced  by $18,200 -- the\n\namount  for  deleading  which had  been  paid  out  of the  operations\n                                                                      \n\naccount.  Id.\n            \n\n    Although not free from doubt, it  appears that Roizman is  arguing\n\nthat the \"double deduction\"  occurred when $75,000 was wired  from the\n\nsyndication account to the  operations account in December 1990.   See\n                                                                      \n\nTrial  Exhibit 7, at  4.  Briefer  testified that only  $56,800 should\n\nhave been transferred.   App. I, Tab 2, at 61.   As a result, not only\n\ndid  the  operations account  lay out  $18,200  for deleading,  but by\n\ntransferring the  full  $75,000,  the  syndication  account  also  was\n\ncharged $18,200.  \n\n    Grabler  first argues  that  Exhibit  RO  was  never  admitted  in\n\nevidence  and that,  in any event,  it was \"superseded\"  by Exhibit 7.\n\nExhibit RO  contains the underlying documents from which Trial Exhibit\n\n6 was prepared  by Roizman and  Briefer.  The district  court admitted\n\nExhibit 6 in evidence on the second day  of trial.  App. I, Tab 2,  at\n\n32.  It later described RO as \"part of exhibit 6,\"   App. I, Tab 2, at\n\n59, and referred to it during the course of the trial.  As such, it is\n\n                                  8\n\nplain that RO was considered  as admitted in evidence by  the district\n\ncourt.  \n\n    As for Exhibit 7,  it is a  memorandum, dated September 20,  1991,\n\nfrom Kohen to  Roizman.  Page 4 reflects Blue Hill syndication account\n\ntransactions for 1990  and 1991.   Grabler points  out that Exhibit  7\n\ndoes not list  $18,200 as a deduction.  He  then makes the observation\n\nthat  RO #5  reflects  only an  \"estimate\"  of Blue  Hill  syndication\n\nprofits.   From this  he concludes that the  $18,200 was accounted for\n\nonly once -- when it was paid out from the operations account.\n\n    Based on  the evidence and testimony,  we think  that the district\n\ncourt's  decision  to credit  Roizman's  explanation  was not  clearly\n\nerroneous.  Exhibit RO  #5 was prepared on February 8,  1991.  At this\n\ntime,  the  operations  account  already  had  paid  the  $18,200  for\n\ndeleading.  Indeed, according to Grabler, the  operations account paid\n\nthis amount in December 1990.  This is the same time that $75,000 from\n\nthe  syndication account  was wired  to the  operations account.   See\n                                                                      \n\nTrial  Exhibit  7, at  4.    To  this  extent,  it  appears  that  the\n\ncalculation concerning the operations deficit of $56,800 (the  $75,000\n\nminus $18,200) is not an estimate.\n\n    3.  Roizman's  claim that Grabler  and Kohen  agreed to return  to\n\nBenchmark  salaries  they  had  received  is  well  supported  by  the\n\nevidence.  In fact, in his brief, Grabler candidly admits  that he and\n\nKohen \"repaid all but $7,800  of the salary they had each  received in\n\n1989\"   to  Benchmark.*****     Appellant's   Brief,  at  33.     This\n\nadmission lends direct support to Roizman's  contention that Kohen and\n\n                    \n\n*****  Grabler's  argument  that he  and  Kohen  each retained  $7,800\nbecause  Roizman allegedly  received  $7,800 in  extra  salary is  not\nrelevant  to the  question whether  an agreement  concerning repayment\nexisted.\n\n                                  9\n\nGrabler had, in fact, agreed  to repay the salaries they  had received\n\nin 1989.  In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the district\n\ncourt's finding that Benchmark still is owed approximately $23,000 for\n\nsalary reimbursement is not clearly erroneous.\n\n    4.    Roizman claims  that  during 1988,  1989  and part  of  1990\n\nGrabler charged all of  his personal calls  to Benchmark.  To  support\n\nthis assertion, Roizman submitted four cellular  one phone bills dated\n\nNovember  11, 1988, January  8, 1989,  July 6,  1989 and  September 7,\n\n1989.  According to Briefer's testimony,  see App. I, Tab 1, at 65-70,\n                                             \n\nhe  reviewed  the above  bills,  identified  Grabler's personal  phone\n\ncharges,  added them  up,  determined an  average  monthly figure  and\n\nmultiplied  it by  the number  of  covered months.   Page  L of  Trial\n\nExhibit 6 contains Briefer's  calculations.  It reveals that  based on\n\nthe four phone  bills, the average  amount of personal phone  calls is\n\n$82.66.  Thus,  for the period June  1988 to December  1990, Benchmark\n\nallegedly  paid  approximately  $2,563  for  Grabler's  personal phone\n\ncalls.   Page H of Trial Exhibit 6,  which contains the summary of how\n\nthe profits of Benchmark should  be adjusted, therefore indicates that\n\nGrabler owes Benchmark $2563.  Grabler  first  argues  that the  claim\n\nmust fail because the telephone bills should not have been admitted in\n\nevidence under Fed. R.  Evid. 1006 (admission of summaries).   Second,\n\nhe  points  out that  Briefer testified  that  he had  no recollection\n\nconcerning whether Benchmark actually  had paid these bills.   App. I,\n\nTab 3, at 25.  Indeed, Briefer  stated that he could not \"recall  what\n\nentity paid  for the  bills.\"  Id.   We believe  that, even  under the\n                                 \n\nclearly  erroneous standard, this claim  must fail.   Therefore, we do\n\nnot address the evidentiary question.\n\n                                  10\n\n    Simply stated,  how much  Roizman might  be due  in damages  would\n\ndepend  on  which entity  paid the  phone  bills.   Assuming Roizman's\n\nfigures are accurate, and Grabler owes Benchmark $2,563, Roizman might\n\nbe  entitled to recover as much as  one-third.  However, if Blue Hill,\n\nElm Hill or some  other entity paid these bills, the  $2,563 repayment\n\nwould not  go directly to Benchmark.   As a result,  Roizman would not\n\nreceive  one-third.  For example,  if one of  the limited partnerships\n\npaid the phone bills, Grabler would reimburse the limited partnership,\n\nand Benchmark, as a fifty percent  owner, might be entitled to as much\n\nas one-half of $2,563 or $1,281.50.   Roizman's share would be reduced\n\nto approximately  $427.  As  Roizman failed to establish  who paid the\n\nphone bills, on the present  record it is impossible to  calculate the\n\namount of any damages due.\n\n    B.  Interest on the Stock Transaction\n                                         \n\n    The final order of the district  court regarding the  disbursement\n\nof  the  purchase price  of  the stock  (which  had been  held  in the\n\nregistry  of  the   district  court),  stated,   subject  to   certain\n\npreconditions not relevant to this appeal, that\n\n    the sum of $96,333.84 shall be released by the Clerk from the\n    Registry of  this Court to Peter  Grabler, representing final\n                                                                 \n    payment  to Grabler  for his  100 shares  of common  stock of\n           \n    Benchmark  Broadway  Corporation  and  Benchmark  Developers,\n    Inc., each,  pursuant to  paragraph 2 of  the Stipulation  of\n    6/28/91. \n\nOrder of  Court, dated November 1991,  reproduced in App.  III, Tab 17\n\n(emphasis added).  \n\n    Grabler  argues that  the  November  1991  Order only  applies  to\n\nparagraph 2  -- the  underlying obligation  of Roizman  concerning the\n\npurchase  price for  the stock  -- and  not to  paragraph 5  which, he\n\n                                  11\n\nasserts, addresses interest on the purchase price.  Grabler also avers\n\nthat contrary to  Roizman's statement in Roizman's  draft order (which\n\nthe  district court adopted) he (Grabler) never agreed to the language\n\nin  Roizman's draft.   Grabler  points  out that  the  draft order  he\n\nsubmitted  to the court,  App. III, Tab  18, did not  specify that the\n\n$96,000 was a \"final payment.\"\n\n    We are  unable to ascertain any basis in the  record for Grabler's\n\nclaim that  he is due  interest on  the purchase price  for the  stock\n\nnotwithstanding    the   final    judgment    of   the    court.******\n\nSpecifically, he  has not  carried  his burden  of demonstrating  that\n\nparagraph 5 of the June Stipulation applied to the stock purchase.  In\n\nany event,  it is not  clear from the  record how such  interest would\n\nhave been calculated and Grabler, in support of his claim to interest,\n\nhas not even established  the period during which such  interest would\n\nhave  accrued.  Consequently, we decline to disturb the final judgment\n\nof the district court regarding this claim.       C. Rule 19 \n                                                            \n\n    Grabler finally  argues on appeal  that the  district court failed\n\nto join Kohen,  Benchmark, Blue  Hill, Elm Hill,  BFGL, Jones and  the\n\nlimited  partners of Blue Hill  and Elm Hill  as indispensable parties\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 19.   We note in this context that Grabler never\n\nfiled a Rule  19 motion for joinder.  Nonetheless,  the district court\n\nwas  aware that  it had  only Grabler  and Roizman  before it  when it\n\nentered judgment and acknowledged that it was directing enforcement of\n\n                    \n\n******Indeed,  the only  reference  the  district  court  made  to  an\ninterest claim by Grabler was its  statement that it was not persuaded\nthat  Roizman was required  to pay  interest on  the sum  of $102,441.\nApp. II,  Tab 2, at 101, which amount appears to relate to the Flipper\nTemple deal  in  Atlanta, not  the  stock purchase  agreement  between\nGrabler and Roizman.\n\n                                  12\n\nthe  June  stipulation  between  Grabler  and  Roizman.*******     For\n\nthe reasons stated below,  it would be premature to  address Grabler's\n\nRule 19 claim at the present time.\n\n    First,  Grabler specifically  promised  to exercise  \"good  faith\"\n\nefforts to  reach an \"agreement  regarding the allocation  of expenses\n\nand partnership distributions\"  in connection with  Benchmark and  the\n\nlimited  partnerships.  June  Stipulation,   7.   He  entered into the\n\nstipulation, which  the court  treated as  an enforceable  contract at\n\ntrial, knowing that  the resolution of  the accounting disputes  might\n\nrequire action on behalf of Benchmark, Blue Hill, Elm Hill and others.\n\n    Second,  after both Grabler  and Roizman  filed post-trial motions\n\n                    \n\n*          *          *          *          *          *          *\n    Now,  it's important to understand that  there are before the\n    Court  only Mr.  Grabler  and  Mr.  Roizman.    None  of  the\n    corporations  have been  joined and  Mr. Kohen  has  not been\n    joined.  The Court infers, but  makes no finding, that one of\n    the reasons  these  parties were  not enjoined  was it  would\n    destroy the  diversity jurisdiction . . .  which is necessary\n    for this  Court to act  and the disputes  arising out of  the\n    settlement agreements  would then have  to be disposed  of in\n    the state court.\n\nApp.  II,  Tab 2,  at 94.    As for  Grabler's  ability to  effect the\njudgment, the district court stated:\n\n    [W]hile  it's certainly  appropriate  for me  to resolve  all\n    matters  as between  Mr. Grabler  and Mr. Roizman  and indeed\n    equitably  to make sure that those two parties who are before\n    the  Court give  effect to  the Court's  judgment, I  have no\n    right to enter orders, nor have I yet entered . . . any order\n    against Mr. Kohen. . . .\n\n                               . . . .\n\n    So,  I  can  imagine   saying,  and  correct  me,  that   the\n    accountings  shall be  as  I decreed  them  and I  order  the\n    parties before the  Court to  give effect  to the  accounting\n    resolution that I have made and leave it at that.\n\nId. at 67.\n   \n\n                                  13\n\nrequesting enforcement  of the court's final  order, Roizman's counsel\n\nfiled a letter  with the court indicating that \"the  parties have been\n\nable to agree in  [sic] the manner in  which to carry out  the Court's\n\nOrder.\"   Thus, it appears that the  means are available with which to\n\nenable Grabler  to effect payment  to Roizman.   Even if  any Rule  19\n\nclaim has not been waived, it  clearly was not addressed below, and is\n\nunripe for review.  For the present, therefore, issues relating to the\n\nenforcement of the district court order are properly presented to that\n\ncourt in the first instance.\n\n    For the  foregoing reasons, the case  is remanded  to the district\n                                                                      \n\ncourt  for further  proceedings  consistent with  this  opinion.   The\n                                                                      \n\njudgment of the  district court  is affirmed, except  as concerns  the\n                                                                      \n\naward of $2,563 to Roizman.  SO ORDERED.\n                                       \n\n                                  14\n</pre>",
