Gabriel       Rivera-Rodríguez\n\n(\"Rivera-Rodríguez\"), Excel Muñiz-Massa (\"Muñiz-Massa\"), Eduardo\n\nPabón-Mandrell (\"Pabón-Mandrell\"), José Rivera-Moreno (\"Rivera-\n\nMoreno\"),      and   Christian      Arzola-Martínez         (\"Arzola-Martínez\"),\n\n(collectively \"Appellants\") were convicted by a jury of a drug\n\ntrafficking conspiracy. Appellants were later sentenced to lengthy\n\nprison terms.\n\n              On appeal, Appellants challenge both their convictions\n\nand sentences.       They advance a spate of claims in the process,\n\nincluding challenges to certain evidentiary rulings the district\n\ncourt   made,     challenges       to   the       sufficiency    of    the   evidence\n\nunderlying      their      convictions,       a    challenge    to    the    ex   parte\n\ncommunications the district judge conducted with prospective jurors\n\nduring voir dire, and challenges to the district court's sentencing\n\nprocess and outcomes.         After careful review of the record, we find\n\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion regarding the\n\nevidentiary rulings and that the evidence adduced at trial was\n\nsufficient for the jury to convict Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa,\n\nand Rivera-Moreno.          We also find that the ex parte conversations\n\nthe district judge held with prospective jurors, though troubling,\n\ndid not amount to plain error.          Moreover, we find that the district\n\ncourt   did    not   err    when   it   provided      Arzola-Martínez        with   the\n\nopportunity to allocute during sentencing or when it found Rivera-\n\nRodríguez individually responsible for at least 4.5 kilograms of\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fcrack cocaine.    Finally, we find that the district court committed\n\nno error concerning the prior criminal histories of Arzola-Martínez\n\nor Pabón-Mandrell when calculating their sentences.        Given our\n\nfindings, we affirm in all respects.\n\n                 I.   Background and Procedural History\n\nA.   Indictment (2007)\n\n           On March 19, 2007, a grand jury sitting in the District\n\nof Puerto Rico returned a two-count indictment against the five\n\nAppellants and thirty-seven other individuals.      Count One of the\n\nindictment charged that, between an unknown date (\"but no later\n\nthan in or about 2003\") and 2007, the group of forty-two defendants\n\nconspired to possess with intent to distribute and did distribute\n\nnarcotics, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(a)(1), and 860.1\n\nB.   Joint Trial and Appeal (2008)\n\n           Over the course of twelve days from February 11 to 27,\n\n2008, Appellants were tried jointly.      Appellants, witnesses, and\n\nthe government referred to the drug trafficking organization of\n\nwhich Appellants were accused of being members as \"Las Avispas\" (in\n\nEnglish, \"The Wasps\").     The original Las Avispas, Las Avispas Uno,\n\noperated in the Borinquen Ward of Guayama, Puerto Rico.        After\n\napproximately forty-three members of Las Avispas Uno were arrested\n\nin 2002, the organization reconstituted itself in 2003 as Las\n\n\n1\n   Count Two, relating to forfeiture of property upon a conviction\nunder Count One, 21 U.S.C. § 853(a)(1) and (2), was dismissed at\neach Appellant's sentencing hearing.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fAvispas Dos, also in the Borinquen Ward.            Las Avispas Dos managed\n\na drug distribution point, Las Vías, approximately 752 feet from\n\nthe   Luis   Muñoz   Elementary      School    (\"the     School\"),    which   was\n\noperational at the time.         Multiple witnesses testified at trial\n\nthat Las Avispas Dos also operated a second drug distribution\n\npoint, La Pluma.\n\n             At   trial,   the   government       presented    evidence       that\n\nAppellants were each active members, if not leaders, of Las Avispas\n\nDos, which conspired to distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine base\n\n(also known as crack cocaine), and marijuana.              Evidence presented\n\nat trial also indicated that members of Las Avispas Dos, including\n\nsome Appellants, (1) possessed firearms to ward off rival drug\n\ntrafficking organizations and to maintain control over their drug\n\ndistribution      points   and   (2)    killed     and    attempted    to     kill\n\nindividuals to further intimidate and exert control.                 Among other\n\nthings, the government specifically alleged that Rivera-Rodríguez\n\nand   Muñiz-Massa,    along   with     two    indicted    co-conspirators      not\n\nappellants in this case, killed Ricardo Haddock-Collazo (\"Haddock\n\n-Collazo\"), on or about September 12, 2004, \"since they believed he\n\nwas providing information about the drug distribution organization\n\nto law enforcement authorities.\"\n\n             On the final day of the trial, the jury found each\n\nAppellant guilty as to Count One of the indictment.              Furthermore,\n\nthe jury unanimously agreed to the following findings, by proof\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fbeyond a reasonable doubt: (1) all Appellants conspired to possess\n\nwith the intent to distribute fifty grams or more of a mixture or\n\nsubstance containing cocaine base (crack); (2) Muñiz-Massa, Pabón-\n\nMandrell, and Rivera-Moreno conspired to possess with the intent to\n\ndistribute    one    kilogram   or     more    of    a    mixture    or       substance\n\ncontaining a detectable amount of heroin; (3) Arzola-Martínez and\n\nRivera-Rodríguez conspired to possess with the intent to distribute\n\nless than one hundred grams of a mixture or substance containing a\n\ndetectable amount of heroin; (4) all Appellants conspired to\n\npossess with the intent to distribute five kilograms or more of a\n\nmixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine; (5)\n\nMuñiz-Massa, Pabón-Mandrell, Rivera-Moreno, and Rivera-Rodríguez\n\nconspired to possess with the intent to distribute one hundred\n\nkilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable\n\namount of marijuana; (6) Arzola-Martínez conspired to possess with\n\nthe intent to distribute less than one hundred kilograms of a\n\nmixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana;\n\nand   (7)   all   Appellants    were   involved      in    conspiracy         and   drug\n\ndistribution activities that took place within 1,000 feet of a\n\npublic and/or private school.\n\n            Appellants were sentenced between May and July of 2008.\n\nOn May 20, the district court sentenced Rivera-Rodríguez to a term\n\nof    imprisonment   of   forty-three        years   followed       by    a    term   of\n\nsupervised release of fifteen years. On May 30, the district court\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fsentenced Muñiz-Massa to a term of imprisonment of sixty years\n\nfollowed by a term of supervised release of fifteen years.        On\n\nJune 6, the district court sentenced Pabón-Mandrell to a term of\n\nimprisonment for the remainder of his natural life followed by a\n\nterm of supervised release of ten years.    On June 25, the district\n\ncourt sentenced Rivera-Moreno to a term of imprisonment of thirty-\n\nfive years followed by a term of supervised release of fifteen\n\nyears.     Finally, on July 28, the district court sentenced Arzola-\n\nMartínez to a term of imprisonment for the remainder of his natural\n\nlife followed by a term of supervised release of fifteen years.2\n\n            Between May and August of 2008, each Appellant filed his\n\ntimely notice of appeal.    Each Appellant raises multiple issues on\n\nappeal.3    First, we address challenges by Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-\n\n\n2\n   In the companion cases of United States v. Cintrón-Echautegui,\n604 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2010), and United States v. Rivera-Moreno, No.\n08-1961, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 14677 (1st Cir. July 19, 2010), two\nco-conspirators in Las Avispas Dos pled guilty to the conspiracy\ncount, and we affirmed the district court's judgments in each case.\n3\n    Besides the issues discussed here, Arzola-Martínez, Pabón-\nMandrell, and Rivera-Rodríguez raised, in their initial brief,\nanother issue, concerning the number of peremptory challenges the\ndistrict court granted to the prosecution at trial.           These\nAppellants argued that the district court committed plain error\nwhen it granted the prosecution twelve peremptory challenges, which\nthese Appellants argued violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n24(b)(2). These Appellants thus requested that we find that the\ndistrict court committed plain error and grant them a new trial.\nIn supplemental appellate briefing that we ordered both parties to\nsubmit after oral argument, the government noted that, during a\nsupplemental conference with the district court on March 12, 2010,\n\"[t]he district court and the trial attorneys (both for the\ngovernment and defense) clarified that although the record says\n'12' only six (6) peremptory challenges were given to the\n\n                                  -7-\n\fMassa,   and     Rivera-Moreno        to    the   district   court's      evidentiary\n\nrulings.    Second, we consider the argument made by these three\n\nAppellants that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient\n\nfor a jury to find them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.                       We then\n\nconsider,      under    plain       error    review,      whether   the    ex    parte\n\nconversations that the district judge held with prospective jurors\n\nviolated Appellants' Sixth Amendment rights.                 Finally, we evaluate\n\nvarious issues raised concerning the sentencing of Arzola-Martínez,\n\nRivera-Rodríguez, and Pabón-Mandrell.\n\n                                    II.    Discussion\n\nA.   Evidentiary Rulings\n\n            On appeal, Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-\n\nMoreno   claim     that      the    district      court   made   several   erroneous\n\nevidentiary rulings at trial.               We disagree.     We conclude that the\n\ndistrict    court      did    not    abuse     its   discretion     in    making   the\n\nevidentiary rulings at issue.\n\n            1.    Standard / Scope of Review\n\n            We review a district court's evidentiary rulings and\n\nBrady determinations for abuse of discretion.                     United States v.\n\nDeCologero, 530 F.3d 36, 65 (1st Cir. 2008); United States v.\n\nWalter, 434 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2006).                         We review de novo\n\n\"whether the strictures of the Confrontation Clause have been met.\"\n\n\ngovernment with two challenges for the 3 alternates.\" Appellants\nconceded the point during that conference, and so we do not address\nthis issue further.\n\n                                            -8-\n\fWalter, 434 F.3d at 33 (quoting United States v. Vega Molina, 407\n\nF.3d 511, 522 (1st Cir. 2005))(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\"Only rarely -- and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances --\n\nwill we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a\n\ndistrict   court's     on-the-spot   judgment    concerning    the    relative\n\nweighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" Freeman v. Package\n\nMach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n           2.    Analysis\n\n                      a.   Arzola-Martínez\n\n           Arzola-Martínez claims that the district court erred when\n\nit   allowed    the   prosecution    to    present,   as   evidence    of   his\n\nmembership in the conspiracy, a firearm and narcotics the police\n\nseized during separate arrests that he argues were unconnected to,\n\neven if they were contemporaneous with, the charged conspiracy.\n\nArzola-Martínez argues that no evidence linked these events to the\n\ncharged conspiracy, so admission of these events was improper\n\ncharacter evidence under Rule 404(b) and prejudicial under Rule\n\n403.\n\n           Víctor     Javier   Veguilla-Figueroa      (\"Officer      Veguilla-\n\nFigueroa\"), a member of the Puerto Rico Police Department (\"PRPD\"),\n\ntestified that, around 9:00 p.m. on October 13, 2005, a date which\n\nfell within the time frame of the charged conspiracy, he and two\n\nother PRPD police officers performing surveillance in Guayama\n\nreceived a communication over their radio that three individuals in\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fa   particular   vehicle   were    armed   and    had   threatened   someone.\n\nOfficer   Veguilla-Figueroa       stated   that   he    and   his   colleagues\n\nidentified and pursued the car, which initially refused to stop.\n\nWhen the vehicle finally did stop, Officer Veguilla-Figueroa placed\n\nthe driver, Arzola-Martínez, under arrest and searched him, seizing\n\na firearm.\n\n           José A. Ortiz-Reyes (\"Officer Ortiz-Reyes\"), another PRPD\n\nmember, testified that, around 2:20 p.m. on April 24, 2006, he and\n\na fellow PRPD police officer performing preventive patrolling in\n\nGuayama observed a particular vehicle almost negligently collide\n\nwith a second vehicle. Officer Ortiz-Reyes indicated to the driver\n\nof the first vehicle that he should stop.               Instead, the vehicle\n\nfled, and Officer Ortiz-Reyes chased it. After the vehicle finally\n\ndid stop, Officer Ortiz-Reyes approached it and observed on the\n\nback floor rug behind the seat of the passenger, whom Officer\n\nOrtiz-Reyes identified as Arzola-Martínez, a plastic ziplock bag\n\ncontaining plastic vials filled with powder that later tested\n\npositive for cocaine. The police then arrested Arzola-Martínez and\n\nthe vehicle's driver.\n\n           The police retrieved the gun from Arzola-Martínez, who\n\npossessed the weapon during the time and in the vicinity of the\n\ndrug conspiracy.    The police retrieved the narcotics from a car in\n\nwhich Arzola-Martínez was a passenger during the time and in the\n\nvicinity of the drug conspiracy. We have previously found that the\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fpresence of firearms and narcotics is probative of an intent to\n\ndistribute narcotics.     See United States v. Rivera-Calderón, 578\n\nF.3d 78, 94 (1st Cir. 2009) (holding that a gun retrieved by police\n\nfrom a defendant who possessed the gun during the time and in the\n\nvicinity of a drug conspiracy \"clearly was relevant evidence\" and\n\nmade it more probable that the defendant was a member of this\n\nparticular conspiracy because, \"in drug trafficking[,] firearms\n\nhave become 'tools of the trade' and thus are probative of the\n\nexistence of a drug conspiracy.\" (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)); see also United States v. Cannon, 589 F.3d 514,\n\n518-19 (1st Cir. 2010).       Because the events to which Officer\n\nVeguilla-Figueroa and Officer Ortiz-Reyes testified occurred at the\n\ntime and in the vicinity of the conspiracy, and also because the\n\nevidence confiscated included \"tools of the trade\" used in the\n\nconspiracy, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nadmitting the testimonies of Officer Veguilla-Figueroa and Officer\n\nOrtiz-Reyes   as   relevant   to      Arzola-Martínez's   role   in   the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n                   b.   Muñiz-Massa\n\n          As we discuss below, the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in making its rulings related to the first three of four\n\nevidentiary rulings Muñiz-Massa claims were erroneous, and we need\n\nnot reach the fourth.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f            First, Muñiz-Massa claims that the district court erred\n\nwhen it prevented him from fully cross-examining the criminal\n\nhistories   of    Carlos   Brito-Pacheco      (\"Brito-Pacheco\")     and   José\n\nRivera-Díaz   (\"Rivera-Díaz\"),     the    government's     two    cooperating\n\nwitnesses, for the purpose of impeaching them as witnesses against\n\nhim.     Muñiz-Massa argues that the district court's evidentiary\n\nruling that prevented the defense from effectively cross-examining\n\nthe government's two main witnesses as to their prior convictions\n\nand arrests unfairly infringed Muñiz-Massa's Confrontation Clause\n\nright under the Sixth Amendment.\n\n            We have previously noted that\n\n            the   right  to   cross-examination   is   not\n            unbridled. So long as the trial court affords\n            the defendant a fair opportunity for effective\n            cross-examination, it may impose reasonable\n            restrictions based on concerns such as undue\n            prejudice, confusion of the issues, witness\n            badgering, redundancy, or questioning that\n            appears to be of marginal relevance.       The\n            trial court's latitude in shaping such\n            restrictions is \"wide.\"\n\nUnited   States   v.   Molina,   407   F.3d   511,   523   (1st   Cir.    2005)\n\n(internal citation omitted).       Specifically, as relevant to Muñiz-\n\nMassa's claim, we have observed that district courts may exercise\n\ndiscretion in restricting a defendant's impeachment of a witness\n\nagainst him by limiting cross-examination of that witness's prior\n\nconduct.    See United States v. Bunchan, 580 F.3d 66, 71 (1st Cir.\n\n2009)(finding no abuse of discretion in the district court's\n\nrestriction of appellant's cross-examination regarding criminal\n\n                                   -12-\n\fcharges pending against a witness where the district court found\n\nreference to the nature of the charged crime too prejudicial under\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 403); see also Fed. R. Evid. 403; Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 608.\n\n            At one point during cross-examination, defense counsel\n\nsought to show that Brito-Pacheco was in prison in 2004 and so\n\ncould not have had first-hand knowledge of events concerning Las\n\nAvispas Dos during a portion of the time to which he testified.          In\n\nfront of the jury, defense counsel asked Brito-Pacheco if it was\n\ntrue that, after his release from prison on June 16, 2003, he was\n\n\"sent back to jail because [he] did not comply with the conditions\n\n[of his probation], right?\"        On the government's objection that\n\ndefense counsel's suggestion was not in good faith (because the\n\ngovernment claimed the defense counsel knew that Brito-Pacheco was\n\nnot, in fact, sent back to jail for violating the conditions of his\n\nprobation) and would leave the jury with an incorrect impression\n\nabout when Brito-Pacheco was incarcerated, the district court\n\ndetermined    that   Brito-Pacheco   was,    in   fact,   imprisoned   from\n\nSeptember 2002 to June 2003 and again from September 2005 through\n\nand including his testimony at trial in February 2008, and so was\n\n\"out on the streets\" in 2004.4            After this review of Brito-\n\nPacheco's    criminal   history,   the    defense   counsel   acknowledged\n\n\n4\n   The record is not clear about the nature of these two arrests\nand convictions.   We can only glean that they were related to\nweapons charges.\n\n                                   -13-\n\f\"[t]hat clears it up Your Honor\"    and that he had \"no problem with\n\nthat.\" At a later point during cross-examination, defense counsel,\n\nBrito-Pacheco, the district court, and the government engaged in\n\nthe following dialogue:\n\n          [Defense counsel]:   I would like to get a\n          chronology of your arrests, convictions,\n          revocations. You were first arrested back in\n          the year 2000 what?\n\n          [Brito-Pacheco]:   2002\n\n          [Defense counsel]:   Was that a drug charge?\n\n          [The government]: Objection, and we object as\n          to the line of questioning being asked and\n          answered as to the specific - -\n\n          [The court]:   The objection goes as to the\n          nature of the charges.       There has been\n          testimony as to the arrests and sentences.\n\nWhile Muñiz-Massa claims in his appellate brief that, at this\n\npoint, the trial court \"prevented defense counsel from cross-\n\nexamining the nature of the prior criminal charges presented\n\nagainst Brito-Pacheco,\" it is clear from the record that the trial\n\ncourt made no ruling either way on the government's objection and\n\ndefense counsel did not seek to clarify or otherwise pursue the\n\nmatter at trial.   Instead, the district court permitted defense\n\ncounsel, uninterrupted, to establish for the jury the dates during\n\nwhich Brito-Pacheco was incarcerated in order to make the point, in\n\nfront of the jury, that Brito-Pacheco had \"no personal knowledge of\n\nanything that occurred in this case after September of 2005.\"    We\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fthus find that the district court allowed Muñiz-Massa \"a fair\n\nopportunity for effective cross-examination\" of Brito-Pacheco.\n\n           With respect to Rivera-Díaz, defense counsel attempted to\n\nquestion the witness about whether he qualified for a reduction in\n\nthe range of his sentencing for a previous arrest.5          Rivera-Díaz\n\nresponded during the cross-examination that he did not qualify for\n\nthe sentence reduction.      The defense counsel then sought to admit\n\nRivera-Díaz's plea agreement about the prior arrest as an exhibit\n\nand to ask Rivera-Díaz why he did not qualify for the sentence\n\nreduction. On the government's objection that the prior conviction\n\ndid not entail truthfulness or dishonesty, the district court\n\nstated   that   it   would   not   permit   defense   counsel's   further\n\nquestioning on the matter.         The district court stated that the\n\ndefense counsel's line of questioning was not in good faith because\n\nthe attorney already knew that Rivera-Díaz did not qualify for the\n\nsentence reduction, and the exhibit could only mislead the jury\n\ninto thinking otherwise.\n\n           In another instance, defense counsel asked Rivera-Díaz to\n\nexplain the criminal history category listed on his plea agreement.\n\nRivera-Díaz responded that he could not explain the concept.          On\n\nthe government's objection to defense counsel continuing the line\n\nof questioning, the district court asked defense counsel to explain\n\n\n5\n    The record is not clear about the nature of this arrest.\nDefense counsel stated that it was for larceny but noted that\nRivera-Díaz said it was drug-related.\n\n                                   -15-\n\fwhere the questioning was leading.               Defense counsel responded that\n\nhe intended to elicit from Rivera-Díaz that the criminal history\n\ncategory is based on the record of conviction and then to ask the\n\nwitness about his prior conviction and government cooperation. The\n\ndistrict   court       precluded   the     line    of   questioning         because   it\n\nconcluded that the questioning was not to be used to explain the\n\nlegal principles involved in various criminal history categories,\n\nas defense counsel claimed, but rather to introduce, indirectly,\n\nthe   witness's    prior    criminal       convictions        that   were    otherwise\n\ninadmissible.      In sum, the district court, through the application\n\nof Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) and the balancing required by\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 403, determined that cross-examination of\n\nthe prior criminal conduct of Rivera-Díaz in these two instances\n\nwas prohibited.\n\n           As     in    Bunchan,    see    id.    at    71,   and    as   Muñiz-Massa\n\nacknowledges, the district judge did permit other cross-examination\n\nof each witness.        Both witnesses were cross-examined on their drug\n\nsales and usage, and Brito-Pacheco was also cross-examined on the\n\nfact of his imprisonment from 2002 to 2003 and from 2005 until his\n\ntestimony at trial and on his cooperation with the government in\n\n2006.   Any restriction of Muñiz-Massa's Confrontation rights was\n\nthus reasonable.\n\n           Second, Muñiz-Massa contends that the district court\n\nerred when it allowed the          government to present witness testimony\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fthrough the use of leading questions.           Muñiz-Massa argues that, at\n\none point during cross-examination, Rivera-Díaz listed the members\n\nof Las Avispas but did not mention Muñiz-Massa, saying, after\n\nnaming fourteen members, that he did not \"recall anybody else[]\n\nright off the top of my head.\"                Muñiz-Massa argues that the\n\nprosecutor then, on redirect examination, had to lead the witness\n\nto elicit a response that included Muñiz-Massa in the membership of\n\nLas Avispas Dos.        The prosecutor asked Rivera-Díaz \"what were the\n\ndifferent roles of the members of Las Avispas, that you see here\n\ntoday?\"    The district court overruled defense counsel's objection\n\nthat the question went beyond his cross-examination, stating that,\n\nalthough defense counsel had not specifically inquired about the\n\nroles of Las Avispas Dos members, because Rivera-Díaz provided a\n\ndescription of roles in cross-examination from other attorneys, the\n\ndistrict judge would allow the testimony.             After the prosecutor\n\nasked \"out of the members of Las Avispas that are present here in\n\ncourt,    what    are    their   different     roles?,\"    Rivera-Díaz   then\n\nidentified Muñiz-Massa as a \"pusher,\" or \"seller,\" at Las Vías.\n\n            In another instance, when the government asked Rivera-\n\nDíaz to \"identify which members of Las Avispas actually carried\n\nfirearms with them,\" Rivera-Díaz did not include Muñiz-Massa in the\n\nlist. The government then asked Rivera-Díaz: \"Are you aware of any\n\nof the members of Las Avispas that you have identified here in\n\ncourt    today,   that    used   to   carry   firearms?\"    Defense   counsel\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fobjected, stating that the prosecution \"is trying to jiggle the\n\nwitness recollection.\" The district court overruled the objection,\n\nstating \"[t]he government may refresh his recollection, with a\n\ndocument or statements or asking him to look around . . . .            [T]his\n\nmorning we had to take a break because [Rivera-Díaz] had not eaten.\n\nSo the government is entitled to probe, and refresh other things\n\nfor   this   witness.\"    The     government    then   asked     Rivera-Díaz:\n\n\"[L]ooking around in the courtroom and out of the members of Las\n\nAvispas that you have identified that are present here in court,\n\nare you aware if any of them used to carry firearms?\"             Rivera-Díaz\n\nthen identified, among others, Muñiz-Massa.\n\n             We have found that any error in the prosecution's use of\n\nleading questions is harmless where there is no evidence that the\n\nleading questions prompted inaccurate testimony. See United States\n\nv. De León-Quiñones, 588 F.3d 748, 756-57 (1st Cir. 2009).             Here,\n\nthe district court explained that it would permit the questions\n\nover defense counsel's objections because they were designed to\n\nelicit   further    information    to   which   the    witness    previously\n\ntestified and also because they were used to refresh recollection.\n\nTwo days before both of the incidents described above, Rivera-Díaz\n\nhad identified Muñiz-Massa as a \"seller\" for Las Avispas Dos who\n\n\"always had the pistol on him and he was always hanging out with\n\n[Rivera-Rodríguez].\"     That testimony is consistent with Rivera-\n\nDíaz's testimony, in response to leading questions, two days later\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fabout   Muñiz-Massa's    membership     in   Las   Avispas   Dos   and   gun\n\npossession.     We thus conclude that any error in allowing these\n\nleading questions was harmless and that there is no evidence that\n\nthey prompted inaccurate testimony.\n\n            Third, Muñiz-Massa argues that the district court erred\n\nwhen it admitted the testimony of Brito-Pacheco, a cooperating\n\nwitness, about Muñiz-Massa's alleged admission that he participated\n\nin Haddock-Collazo's murder. Specifically, Muñiz-Massa claims that\n\nthe government failed to disclose his inculpatory admission to the\n\ndefense before the government presented Brito-Pacheco's testimony\n\nat trial.      Muñiz-Massa argues that this disclosure was required\n\npursuant to Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), and its\n\nprogeny, which held that \"a defendant is deprived of his Sixth\n\nAmendment right of confrontation when the facially incriminating\n\nconfession of a nontestifying codefendant is introduced at their\n\njoint trial, even if the jury is instructed to consider the\n\nconfession only against the codefendant.\" Richardson v. Marsh, 481\n\nU.S. 200, 207 (1987)(citing Bruton, 391 U.S. at 135-36).           However,\n\nalthough Muñiz-Massa objected at trial to Brito-Pacheco's testimony\n\nabout Muñiz-Massa's admission on hearsay grounds, Muñiz-Massa did\n\nnot   object   on   Bruton   grounds.     Muñiz-Massa   thus   waived    any\n\nobjection to this matter by not raising it at trial.           See Campos-\n\nOrrego v. Rivera, 175 F.3d 89, 95 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"We have\n\nreiterated, with a regularity bordering on the echolalic, that a\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fparty's failure to advance an issue in the nisi prius court\n\nordinarily bars consideration of that issue on appellate review.\").\n\nFurthermore, even if Muñiz-Massa had raised this matter at trial,\n\nBruton is inapplicable because the statement in question was his\n\nown, not that of a codefendant.      The district court thus did not\n\nerr in admitting Brito-Pacheco's testimony about Muñiz-Massa's\n\nalleged admission.\n\n          Finally, Muñiz-Massa contends that the district court\n\nerred when it admitted photographic evidence of Haddock-Collazo's\n\nmurdered body.      Rule 403 gives trial courts broad discretion to\n\nreject   evidence    when   its   probative   value   is   substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.         Fed. R. Evid. 403;\n\nsee also United States v. Smith, 292 F.3d 90, 99 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nIn a prosecution alleging that the defendants participated in a\n\nmurder, the district court may conclude that photographic evidence\n\nof the murder helps the jury understand the nature and severity of\n\nthe charged conduct and is not unfairly prejudicial.         See United\n\nStates v. Cartano, 420 F.2d 362, 364-65 (1st Cir. 1970); see also,\n\ne.g., United States v. Greatwalker, 356 F.3d 908, 912-13 (8th Cir.\n\n2004).   Even if the district court abused its discretion here,\n\nwhich we seriously doubt, any purported error was harmless in light\n\nof the other overwhelming evidence against Muñiz-Massa. See United\n\nStates v. Hicks, 575 F.3d 130, 143 (1st Cir. 2009) (\"We review non-\n\nconstitutional evidentiary errors for harmlessness; an error is\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fharmless if it is 'highly probable that the error did not influence\n\nthe verdict.'\" (citation omitted)).\n\n                    c.    Rivera-Moreno\n\n            Rivera-Moreno claims that the government violated his\n\nrights protected by Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), when it\n\nfailed to disclose the allegedly exculpatory testimony Rivera-Díaz\n\nprovided during sentencing, which Rivera-Moreno claims contradicted\n\ntestimony Rivera-Díaz provided during trial. Rivera-Moreno's claim\n\nconcerns testimony Rivera-Díaz provided in an interview with a\n\nprobation     officer    during    the   preparation    of   Rivera-Moreno's\n\nPresentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\").\n\n            Rivera-Moreno        concedes     that     \"[t]he   government's\n\nobligations     under    Brady    only   extend   to   information   in   its\n\npossession, custody, or control.\"           United States v. Hall, 434 F.3d\n\n42, 55 (1st Cir. 2006).      Nevertheless, Rivera-Moreno contends that\n\nthe government had a duty to learn and disclose the details of\n\nRivera-Díaz's sentencing-related testimony.            That, however, is not\n\nthe law.    \"While a prosecutor must disclose information maintained\n\nby government agents even if the prosecutor herself does not\n\npossess the information, this duty does not extend to information\n\npossessed by government agents not working with the prosecution.\"\n\nId. (internal citations omitted). Rivera-Díaz's sentencing-related\n\ntestimony was maintained by the probation officer preparing the\n\nPSR, and there is no evidence that the federal prosecutor or any\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fagent working on the U.S. Attorney's behalf had this information\n\nprior to or during trial. Accordingly, the government committed no\n\nBrady violation.\n\nB.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           At the close of the government's case-in-chief, Arzola-\n\nMartínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-Moreno each filed a timely motion\n\nfor judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n\n29(a) (\"Rule 29 motion\").   The district court denied each of these\n\nmotions and proceeded with closing arguments before submitting the\n\ncase to the jury.   On appeal, these three Appellants, although not\n\nchallenging whether a drug conspiracy existed, claim that the\n\nevidence presented at trial was insufficient for a jury to find\n\nthem guilty of participating in it.6    These three Appellants thus\n\nrequest that we reverse their convictions and remand their cases to\n\nthe district court for a new trial.    We decline to do so.   In this\n\nsection, we consider whether the evidence discussed in the previous\n\nsection, along with other evidence, could have led a reasonable\n\njury to find each of these three Appellants guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt of the conspiracy charged.      We conclude that a\n\n\n\n\n6\n   Arzola-Martínez and Muñiz-Massa also attack the credibility of\nwitnesses who testified at trial as a basis for finding that the\nevidence was insufficient for a jury to find them guilty. However,\n\"[w]e do not assess the credibility of a witness, as that is a role\nreserved for the jury.\" United States v. Troy, 583 F.3d 20, 24\n(1st Cir. 2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nWe thus need not consider this matter.\n\n                                -22-\n\freasonable jury could find Appellants guilty beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\n\n            1.    Standard / Scope of Review\n\n            We review the denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal de novo.        Troy, 583 F.3d at 24.       In so doing,\n\n            we examine the evidence, both direct and\n            circumstantial, in the light most favorable to\n            the jury's verdict.     We do not assess the\n            credibility of a witness, as that is a role\n            reserved for the jury.       Nor need we be\n            convinced that the government succeeded in\n            eliminating every possible theory consistent\n            with the defendant's innocence.     Rather, we\n            must decide whether that evidence, including\n            all plausible inferences drawn therefrom,\n            would allow a rational factfinder to conclude\n            beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\n            committed the charged crime.\n\nId.

Legal Framework\n\n          Appellants   were   charged   with   participating   in    a\n\nconspiracy to distribute drugs.    We have previously found that,\n\n          [t]o establish that a conspiracy existed, the\n          government had to prove beyond a reasonable\n          doubt that each defendant knowingly and\n          voluntarily agreed with others to commit a\n          particular crime.   Such an agreement may be\n          express or tacit, that is, represented by\n          words or actions, and may be proved by direct\n          or circumstantial evidence.\n\nRivera-Calderón, 578 F.3d at 88-89 (citations omitted); United\n\nStates v.

Analysis\n\n                   a.   Arzola-Martínez\n\n          Arzola-Martínez argues that evidence of what he claims\n\nwere merely \"occasional\" sales of \"small\" amounts of cocaine to\n\nRivera-Rodríguez was insufficient to warrant his conviction as a\n\nconspirator of Las Avispas Dos or to establish a violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 860.    Arzola-Martínez contends that the prosecution did\n\nnot establish that he had a stake in the success of the retail\n\nsales made by the drug organization at the housing project or in\n\nits profits.    Furthermore, Arzola-Martínez argues that, because\n\nthere was no evidence that Arzola-Martínez sold cocaine to Rivera-\n\nRodríguez near the School, the evidence was insufficient to convict\n\nhim under 21 U.S.C. § 860.\n\n          Arzola-Martínez's arguments miss the mark.      We find that\n\nsufficient evidence was presented at trial for a rational jury to\n\nconclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Arzola-Martínez was a\n\nconspirator of Las Avispas Dos and to establish his violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 860.    First, a former member of both Las Avispas Uno and\n\nDos, Brito-Pacheco, testified that Arzola-Martínez was a member of\n\nLas Avispas Dos with whom he would \"sell drugs\" and \"shoot\" people.\n\nBrito-Pacheco    further   testified    that   Arzola-Martínez   \"quite\n\nfrequently\" sold cocaine in the Borinquen Ward to Rivera-Rodríguez\n\nin order for Rivera-Rodríguez to manufacture crack because the\n\ncrack \"sells alot [sic] and makes alot [sic] of money.\"\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\f               Second, as discussed above, Officer Veguilla-Figueroa\n\ntestified that when he arrested Arzola-Martínez in 2005, Officer\n\nVeguilla-Figueroa seized a firearm from him.           Third, also as\n\ndiscussed above, Officer Ortiz-Reyes testified that in 2006 Arzola-\n\nMartínez was a passenger in a car in which the police found plastic\n\nvials of a substance later shown to contain cocaine.       A search of\n\nthe vehicle conducted in the presence of both Arzola-Martínez and\n\nthe driver also uncovered in the front glove compartment $468 in\n\ncash, which Arzola-Martínez told Officer Ortiz-Reyes belonged to\n\nhim.\n\n               We find that this direct and circumstantial evidence was\n\nsufficient to convict Arzola-Martínez of Count One.      The testimony\n\nof     these     three   witnesses    about   Arzola-Martínez's   role,\n\nrelationships, and activities in Las Avispas Dos was sufficient for\n\na reasonable jury to conclude that Arzola-Martínez knowingly and\n\nvoluntarily agreed with others to participate in Las Avispas Dos's\n\ndrug-related activities.        A reasonable jury could conclude from\n\nBrito-Pacheco's testimony that Arzola-Martínez was a member of Las\n\nAvispas Dos who engaged in drug dealing, shooting people, and\n\nsupplying cocaine to Rivera-Rodríguez.         A reasonable jury could\n\ninfer from the testimony of Officer Veguilla-Figueroa and Officer\n\nOrtiz-Reyes that the firearm, cocaine, and cash they found on or\n\nwith Arzola-Martínez were related to his participation in Las\n\nAvispas Dos.       Not only, as discussed above, have we previously\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\ffound the presence of drugs and guns to be probative of an intent\n\nto distribute narcotics, but we have also found lesser sums than\n\nthat with which Arzola-Martínez was found to be \"substantial\n\namounts [of cash]\" that, when discovered near narcotics in a\n\nvehicle, \"support the inference that the car's occupants were\n\nengaged in the sale, rather than casual use, of drugs.\"              Cannon,\n\n589 F.3d at 518.\n\n           In   order   to   convict    Arzola-Martínez   of   the   charged\n\nconspiracy, the government need not have established that Arzola-\n\nMartínez sold cocaine at a particular frequency or of a certain\n\namount, or that he had a personal stake in the success of Las\n\nAvispas Dos's sales or profits. Rather, the government only had to\n\nprove that he was a member of the conspiracy and that the sales and\n\nprofits were reasonably foreseeable to him.           As discussed above,\n\nthe government met that burden.\n\n           The government, moreover, need not have established that\n\nArzola-Martínez himself sold cocaine near the School, again so long\n\nas the government proved he was a member of the conspiracy and the\n\nlocation   of   those   sales   was    reasonably    foreseeable     to   him.\n\nAccording to a former member of Las Avispas Uno and Dos, Rivera-\n\nDíaz, Las Avispas Dos members would prepare crack in a house\n\nadjacent to the School.         As discussed above, Las Vías, a drug\n\ndistribution    point    Las    Avispas      Dos   managed,    was   located\n\napproximately 752 feet from the School.\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\f                 b.    Muñiz-Massa\n\n          Muñiz-Massa claims that the evidence was \"insufficient to\n\nshow [his] knowledge and/or participation in\" the conspiracy.      In\n\nparticular, Muñiz-Massa alleges that \"it was never clear on the\n\nrecord whether he was associated and part of the 'Las V[í]as' or\n\n'La Pluma' drug organization or both.\"\n\n          At trial, cooperating witness Brito-Pacheco testified\n\nthat, like Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa was a member of Las Avispas\n\nDos with whom he would \"sell drugs\" and \"shoot\" people.      Brito-\n\nPacheco specified that Muñiz-Massa sold drugs and was a \"runner\"7\n\nfor Las Avispas Dos.    Brito-Pacheco further testified that Muñiz-\n\nMassa was his partner in selling drugs in order to \"keep an eye on\n\neach other and to make money [for] both of us.\"   Brito-Pacheco also\n\nstated that Muñiz-Massa told him that, in September 2004 and in\n\nfurtherance of the charged conspiracy, Muñiz-Massa, along with\n\nRivera-Rodríguez and three others, killed Haddock-Collazo, whom\n\nthey suspected of cooperating with law enforcement's investigation\n\nof Las Avispas Dos.    Brito-Pacheco helped dispose of the body.   In\n\nhis testimony at trial, Charles Alvarado-Dávila, a member of the\n\nPRPD, corroborated Brito-Pacheco's description of the date on\n\nwhich, and the location where, Haddock-Collazo's body was found,\n\n\n\n7\n  Rivera-Díaz testified that a runner \"is in charge of keeping the\nmaterial in his house to then bring it over to the drug point and\nhand it over to the seller, and then to collect the monies and keep\nit for the owner of the material.\"\n\n                                 -28-\n\fits condition, and, also consistent with Brito-Pacheco's testimony,\n\nthat the body had been moved between two locations.                      At trial, a\n\nforensic      pathologist     testified     that,    through      an    autopsy    she\n\nperformed on his body, she determined Haddock-Collazo's cause of\n\ndeath   to    be    from   \"severe   head   trauma.\"           This    testimony   was\n\nconsistent with the description of the murder about which Brito-\n\nPacheco testified that Muñiz-Massa had told him.\n\n              Rivera-Díaz testified that, during the course of and\n\nrelated      to    the   charged   conspiracy,      he   saw    Muñiz-Massa    carry\n\nfirearms. Rivera-Díaz stated that Muñiz-Massa \"would sell for [Las\n\nAvispas Dos] . . . .          He always had the pistol on him and he was\n\nalways hanging out with [Rivera-Rodríguez].\"\n\n              We find that this evidence was sufficient to convict\n\nMuñiz-Massa.        The testimony of these four witnesses about Muñiz-\n\nMassa's role, relationships, and activities in Las Avispas Dos was\n\nsufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Muñiz-Massa\n\nknowingly and voluntarily agreed with others to participate in Las\n\nAvispas Dos's drug-related activities, engaged in drug dealing and,\n\nin furtherance of the conspiracy, violently confronted other people\n\nwhom Muñiz-Massa perceived as a threat to the organization.\n\n              As discussed above, multiple witnesses testified at trial\n\nthat the single Las Avispas Dos organization operated two drug\n\ndistribution points, called Las Vías and La Pluma. Las Avispas Dos\n\n-- and not Las Vías and La Pluma -- was the organization of which\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fMuñiz-Massa and others were charged with being members.               The jury\n\ncould have reasonably concluded that Las Vías and La Pluma, both\n\nareas in the Borinquen Ward of Guayama, were merely locations of\n\nLas Avispas Dos's operations.            The government need only to have\n\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt that Muñiz-Massa was involved in\n\nLas Avispas Dos, irrespective of his involvement in a particular\n\ndrug distribution point, and it did just that.\n\n                     c.     Rivera-Moreno\n\n              Rivera-Moreno claims that the record lacked \"any evidence\n\nor a reliable inference from any evidence to establish any intent\n\nor partial intent to enter into an agreement\" sufficient to convict\n\nhim of the charged conspiracy.           We find otherwise.\n\n              According to Rivera-Díaz's testimony at trial, in 2003,\n\nhe and other former members of Las Avispas Uno, including Rivera-\n\nMoreno    (Rivera-Díaz's       brother-in-law),       met   to    discuss   the\n\nestablishment,      management,    and    operation   of    Las   Avispas   Dos.\n\nRivera-Díaz testified that, because Rivera-Moreno \"was the runner\n\nfor the owner of [Las Avispas Uno] . . . and he knew who to buy the\n\ndrugs or heroin from,\" the group decided that Rivera-Moreno would\n\n\"stay in charge\" of Las Avispas Dos, which meant he would \"be the\n\nowner    of   the   [drug    distribution]    point.\"       Rivera-Díaz     also\n\ntestified that Rivera-Moreno would obtain heroin from a contact and\n\nthen pass it along to other members of Las Avispas Dos who served\n\nas runners and distributors.             Rivera-Díaz further testified to\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fRivera-Moreno's leadership role in Las Avispas Dos when the former\n\nstated that the latter \"ordered\" Las Avispas Dos members \"not to\n\nsell on Holy Friday\" and that the runner of heroin for Las Avispas\n\nDos would give to Rivera-Moreno $9.00 of the $10.00 cost of each of\n\n800 to 900 packages of heroin sold during each of three shifts per\n\nday.\n\n          A second cooperating witness, Brito-Pacheco, corroborated\n\nRivera-Díaz's testimony about Rivera-Moreno's participation in Las\n\nAvispas Dos, including Rivera-Moreno's role as the organization's\n\nheroin supplier.      As he had done with Arzola-Martínez and Muñiz-\n\nMassa, Brito-Pacheco testified that he would \"sell drugs\" and\n\n\"shoot\" people with Rivera-Moreno.\n\n          A   third    witness,   César   Alicea-Léon    (\"Alicea-Léon\"),\n\ntestified that, between 2003 and 2006, he distributed \"large\n\namounts\" of heroin to Rivera-Moreno, whom Alicea-Léon stated \"was\n\nin charge\" of the drug distribution point in the Borinquen Ward.\n\n          A fourth witness, Roberto Ayala-Vega (\"Officer Ayala-\n\nVega\"), who worked in the PRPD's Tactical Division from 2005 to\n\n2007, testified that on or about November 4, 2006 he was patrolling\n\nthe Borinquen Ward when Rivera-Moreno and another person \"became\n\naware of [his] patrol car . . . .         They started running off and\n\nthey dropped controlled substances . . . .\"             Field tests later\n\nrevealed that the substances contained cocaine and heroin, which a\n\ntrained and licensed chemist at the Puerto Rico Forensic Science\n\n\n                                   -31-\n\fInstitute specializing in controlled substances corroborated in\n\nseparate testimony. In the vehicle Rivera-Moreno and his associate\n\nabandoned,     Officer   Ayala-Vega     found    Rivera-Moreno's   driver's\n\nlicense, Social Security card, and medical plan card.\n\n            Rivera-Moreno argues that this evidence is insufficient\n\nbecause \"[t]he United States did not have available at trial any\n\naudio, video[,] or photograph depicting [him] doing any illegal\n\nact.     Much less, we should consider that no firearms, monies, or\n\ndrugs were either seized or observed in [his] immediate presence.\"\n\nHowever, as we have previously observed, \"[t]he fact that the\n\ngovernment did not present certain kinds of evidence does not\n\n[necessarily]    mean    that   there   was     insufficient   evidence   for\n\nconviction.\"    United States v. Liranzo, 385 F.3d 66, 70 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n            We find that the evidence presented was sufficient to\n\nconvict Rivera-Moreno. The testimony of these four witnesses about\n\nRivera-Moreno's role, relationships, and activities in Las Avispas\n\nDos was sufficient for a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat Rivera-Moreno knowingly and voluntarily agreed with others to\n\nparticipate in, if not also to lead, Las Avispas Dos's drug-related\n\nactivities.\n\n            In sum, a jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-Moreno were guilty of\n\nparticipating in the charged conspiracy.           We have previously found\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\fsimilar evidence sufficient to sustain a drug-related conspiracy\n\nconviction. See, e.g., United States v. Rodríguez-Lozada, 558 F.3d\n\n29, 39 (explaining that \"[t]he evidence is more than sufficient for\n\na rational jury to find\" that defendant was part of a drug-\n\ntrafficking conspiracy where there was evidence of defendant's\n\ndrug-related relationships and drug-supplying activities).\n\nC.   Ex Parte Communications\n\n           A third claim concerns the process by which the district\n\ncourt conducted voir dire at trial.         In their initial appellate\n\nbriefs,   Arzola-Martínez,    Pabón-Mandrell,     and    Rivera-Rodríguez\n\nclaimed that the district court committed plain error when it\n\nconducted individual, ex parte voir dire of prospective jurors,\n\nwhich these Appellants argue violated Federal Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure 43(a)(2).    Through supplemental briefing that we ordered\n\nduring oral argument, which the parties filed after the district\n\njudge   held   a   supplemental   hearing   on   March   12,   2010   (\"the\n\nsupplemental hearing\"), the other two Appellants, Muñiz-Massa and\n\nRivera-Moreno, also asserted this claim, arguing that \"the method\n\nemployed [was] the equivalent of depriving [A]ppellants of their\n\nSixth Amendment constitutional right to a public trial and that\n\nthey be present during all stages of the trial.\"         Appellants thus\n\nrequest we find that the district court committed plain error by\n\nengaging in ex parte communications with prospective jurors and\n\ngrant Appellants a new trial.     The government responds that any ex\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\fparte   conversations    between    the   judge   and    jurors    were   not\n\nstructural error and harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and, in\n\nany case, Appellants waived any objection to them by not raising\n\nthe matter at trial.     As discussed below, we find that the ex parte\n\nconversations that the district judge held with prospective jurors\n\nshould be reviewed under -- and fail to satisfy -- the plain error\n\nstandard.\n\n            1.   Standard / Scope of Review\n\n            Neither Appellants nor the government objected to the ex\n\nparte communications described below at trial.           The Supreme Court\n\nrecently clarified the standard of review an appellate court must\n\napply when considering a claim not raised at trial.               See United\n\nStates v. Marcus, 130 S. Ct. 2159, 2164 (2010).          The Supreme Court\n\nobserved that \"[Federal] Rule [of Criminal Procedure] 52(b) permits\n\nan   appellate   court   to   recognize   a   'plain   error   that   affects\n\nsubstantial rights,' even if the claim of error was 'not brought'\n\nto the district court's 'attention.'\"         Id.; see also Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 52(b).    The Court held:\n\n            an appellate court may, in its discretion,\n            correct an error not raised at trial only\n            where the appellant demonstrates that (1)\n            there is an error; (2) the error is clear or\n            obvious, rather than subject to reasonable\n            dispute;    (3)   the   error   affected   the\n            appellant's substantial rights, which in the\n            ordinary case means it affected the outcome of\n            the district court proceedings; and (4) the\n            error   seriously   affect[s]  the   fairness,\n            integrity or public reputation of judicial\n            proceedings.\n\n                                   -34-\n\fMarcus, 130 S. Ct. at 2164 (alteration in original)(citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          As discussed below, we assume arguendo that Appellants'\n\nclaim satisfies the first and second prong of the Supreme Court's\n\narticulation of the plain error standard.      However, because we do\n\nnot find that Appellants' claim satisfies the third prong, we need\n\nnot resolve the fourth prong, and Appellants' claim fails.        Before\n\nengaging in our plain error review, we summarize the ex parte\n\ncommunications and the district court's rationale for them.\n\n          2.    The Ex Parte Communications\n\n          Appellants claim, and the government does not refute,\n\nthat the district court conducted ex parte examinations of fifteen\n\nprospective jurors -- Juror Nos. 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 21, 23, 35, 40,8\n\n41, 47, 58, 60, 64, and 66 -- out of a total of seventy-one\n\nprospective    jurors.9,10   In   other   words,   21   percent   of   the\n\n\n8\n   An inconsistency exists in the record with respect to Juror No.\n40. At one point during voir dire on February 11, 2008, Juror No.\n40 is recorded as referring to \"my wife,\" whereas at another point\non the same day the juror is recorded as referring to \"[m]y\nhusband.\" Furthermore, despite the jury list indicating a female\nname for Juror No. 40, the district judge, during the supplemental\nhearing, referred to the prospective juror using the masculine\npronoun and mentioned the juror's \"wife.\" The gender of the juror\nand the juror's spouse are irrelevant to our inquiry, so we need\nnot resolve these matters.\n9\n    We derive the total number of prospective jurors from the\ndistrict judge's list provided in Appellants' supplemental brief.\n10\n   In the cases of Juror Nos. 2 and 35, the trial transcript does\nnot explicitly state that the conversations occurred \"[a]t the\nbench,\" as the trial transcripts of the other ex parte\n\n                                  -35-\n\fprospective jurors were examined ex parte by the district court.\n\nSix of those prospective jurors -- Juror Nos. 1, 2, 10, 23, 35, and\n\n40 -- were not excused by the district judge and thus were\n\ncandidates   for    peremptory    strike   challenges.       Four   of   those\n\nunexcused prospective jurors -- Juror Nos. 10, 23, 35, and 40 --\n\nwere struck by the defendants (the government did not strike any of\n\nthem), leaving two of those prospective jurors -- Juror Nos. 1 and\n\n2 -- on the panel.         As a result, 16.7 percent of the empaneled\n\njurors were subjected to ex parte communications by the court\n\nduring the voir dire process.\n\n          The      district     judge   employed   various     methods    for\n\nmemorializing      these   ex   parte   communications.      For    ex   parte\n\n\ncommunications do.\n     In the case of Juror No. 2, the district judge summarized the\nconversation when she summarized the ex parte communications she\nconducted with other prospective jurors, suggesting that the\njudge's communication with this juror was also ex parte. During\nthe supplemental hearing, the district judge resolved this matter\nby acknowledging that the prospective juror \"was examined at the\nbench.\"\n     In the case of Juror No. 35, the trial transcript reflects\nthat that prospective juror stated his number and then that the\ndistrict judge summarized what the prospective juror said. This\nportion of the transcript thus suggests that the district judge did\nconduct an unrecorded ex parte communication with this prospective\njuror.\n     Given that (1) the district judge summarized the conversations\nshe had with both Juror Nos. 2 and 35, as she did with the other\nthirteen prospective jurors with whom she conducted ex parte\ncommunications, (2) Appellants claim and the government does not\nrefute that Juror Nos. 2 and 35 were subject to ex parte\ncommunications, and (3) the district judge concedes that at least\nthe communication with Juror No. 2 was ex parte, we assume that\nboth of these jurors were indeed among the prospective jurors\nquestioned by the district judge outside the presence of counsel.\n\n                                    -36-\n\fcommunications with nine of the fifteen prospective jurors (Juror\n\nNos. 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 21, 23, 40, and 47), the court reporter was\n\npresent and the trial transcript thus reflects the conversations\n\nbetween the district judge and the prospective jurors.                For ex\n\nparte communications with six of the prospective jurors (Juror Nos.\n\n35, 41, 58, 60,11 64, and 66), the court reporter was not present\n\nand the trial transcript thus does not reflect the conversations\n\nbetween the district judge and the prospective jurors, or at least,\n\nin one of these cases (Juror No. 60), what the prospective juror\n\nsaid.      After each    of these six sets of unrecorded ex parte\n\ncommunications, the district judge provided a summary of the\n\nconversation, as reflected in the trial transcript.\n\n            In the course of conducting these ex parte communications\n\nwith prospective jurors, the district judge made at least two\n\nmistakes    of   fact   and   at   least   one   significant   omission   when\n\nsummarizing the prospective jurors' statements to counsel. The two\n\nmistakes of fact concerned Juror Nos. 1 and 2, both of whom, as\n\nnoted above, were ultimately empaneled on the jury.             The omission\n\n\n11\n   In the case of Juror No. 60, the trial transcript omits what the\nprospective juror said, noting only that it was in Spanish. The\ntrial transcript does, however, reflect what the district judge\nstated. Because the transcript of the district judge's statement\nis within the portion of the transcript noted as being \"[a]t the\nbench,\" and not \"[i]n open court,\" that suggests that, contrary to\nAppellants' claim, the court reporter was present and did\ntranscribe the district judge's statement, but omitted the\nprospective juror's statement. The Spanish answers of Juror No. 60\ncould have been translated by the court reporter if proper\nprocedure had been followed.\n\n                                      -37-\n\fconcerned Juror No. 40, who, as noted above, was later removed by\n\na peremptory strike exercised by defense counsel.\n\n            During the ex parte communication that the district judge\n\nheld with Juror No. 1, that juror told the judge that his \"son is\n\nincarcerated in the state of Florida for a drug related charge\"\n\n(emphasis    added).    However,    when   summarizing   the   ex   parte\n\ncommunication to counsel, the judge stated that this juror's \"son\n\nhad a drug case for which he is incarcerated in the state of\n\nConnecticut\" (emphasis added).      When asked whether either counsel\n\nwanted to question this juror, both parties did so briefly about a\n\nprevious case in which the individual served as a juror.            During\n\nthe supplemental hearing, the district judge acknowledged that the\n\nstate in which the juror's son was incarcerated \"may have been\n\nmisstated\" but noted that \"the information that the individual had\n\na son incarcerated for a conviction . . . is correct.\"\n\n            During the ex parte communication that the district judge\n\nheld with Juror No. 2, the juror told the judge that he \"was a\n\nwitness in court, in a criminal case for the defense\" (emphasis\n\nadded).   When asked by the judge if it was \"a drug case,\" the juror\n\nresponded that \"[i]t was a criminal state case\" (emphasis added).\n\nHowever, when summarizing the ex parte communication to counsel,\n\nthe judge stated that this juror \"served as a witness in a local\n\ncourt case, he was a witness for the defense and it was a sex\n\noffender case.   He was a witness for the defense in a criminal sex\n\n\n                                   -38-\n\foffender case\" (emphasis added). When asked whether either counsel\n\nwanted to question this juror, both parties declined.\n\n           During the ex parte communication that the district judge\n\nheld with Juror No. 40, the juror told the judge: \"The brother of\n\nmy wife has been a drug user for sometime [sic].   He is now in the\n\nmental ward, he has never been a [sic] accused or anything like\n\nthat, but that is the situation.\"   When asked by the judge \"[d]oes\n\nthat affect your impartiality?,\" the juror responded \"[h]opefully\n\nnot.\"   The record indicates that this information was not conveyed\n\nto counsel, either during the judge's summaries of the ex parte\n\ncommunications to counsel or at any other time.\n\n           3.   The District Court's Rationale for the Ex Parte\n           Communications\n\n           The district judge explained, before conducting the ex\n\nparte communications, that she felt they were necessary \"to save\n\ntime,\" because, given that the trial involved multiple defendants,\n\n\"having 12 attorneys moving into and out of the bench [would] be\n\ntime consuming.\"   The district judge stated at the beginning of\n\nvoir dire that, after she heard all of the prospective jurors'\n\nexcuses for not being empaneled, she would \"make a judgment call\n\njointly with the attorneys.\"   The district judge also stated that\n\nex parte communications would enable prospective jurors to discuss\n\n\"personal matters\" with the judge that the jurors did not \"want to\n\nshare . . . publicly.\"   It was thus the district court -- not one\n\n\n\n                                -39-\n\fof     the   parties       --    that,   sua      sponte,      initiated      ex    parte\n\ncommunications.\n\n             At the supplemental hearing, the district judge stated\n\nmultiple times that the communications described above were all \"on\n\nthe record,\" despite not occurring in the presence of counsel and\n\nsome not being recorded by the court reporter.                      She justified her\n\nexplanation by stating that \"notes were taken.\" The district court\n\nfurther stated that several of the communications are \"not an\n\nissue\" because the \"juror was excused for cause\" and thus \"never\n\nbecame a member of the jury panel.\"\n\n             4.    Plain Error Review\n\n             As    the    government     concedes,       ex    parte   communications\n\nbetween the judge and the jury may raise concerns under Federal\n\nRule    of   Criminal       Procedure     43(a)        and    the   Fifth     and   Sixth\n\nAmendments.        See Presley v. Georgia, 130 S. Ct. 721, 724 (2010)\n\n(holding that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial extends\n\nto   voir    dire);       United    States   v.    Gagnon,      470    U.S.    522,   528\n\n(1985)(explaining that the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause\n\ngives the defendant the right to be present and confront all\n\nwitnesses and evidence against him and that the Fifth Amendment's\n\nDue Process Clause protects the right to be present \"in some\n\nsituations        where    the     defendant      is    not    actually     confronting\n\nwitnesses or evidence against him\"); Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S.\n\n337, 338, 342-43 (1970)(holding that the Sixth Amendment protects\n\n\n                                         -40-\n\fa defendant's right not to be completely excluded from voir dire);\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 43(a).\n\n          Still, the defendant's right to be present during voir\n\ndire is not absolute; it must be balanced against the need to\n\nconduct a fair, safe, and orderly trial.   See, e.g., Presley, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 724-25 (noting that some circumstances may justify\n\nclosing voir dire to the public); Gagnon, 470 U.S. at 526-27\n\n(noting that \"[t]he defense has no constitutional right to be\n\npresent at every interaction between a judge and a juror\" and\n\nholding that the Due Process Clause only protects the accused's\n\nright to be present when his presence has a reasonably substantial\n\nrelationship to the need to defend himself); Allen, 397 U.S. at\n\n342-43 (holding that a defendant, with disruptive behavior, may\n\nforfeit his Sixth Amendment right to be present); see also United\n\nStates v. Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d 163, 182 (1st Cir. 2000)(finding\n\nno Rule 43 violation when the defendant was \"restricted from full\n\nparticipation in a limited number of sidebar conferences that\n\noccurred during voir dire\").\n\n          We assume arguendo that the first and second prongs of\n\nplain error review, as articulated in Marcus, are satisfied based\n\non Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43(a) and the Fifth and Sixth\n\nAmendments.   We thus consider the third prong in more detail.   The\n\nSupreme Court noted that, \"[i]n the ordinary case, to meet this\n\n[third prong] standard[,] an error must be 'prejudicial,' which\n\n\n                               -41-\n\fmeans that there must be a reasonable probability that the error\n\naffected the outcome of the trial.\"              Marcus, 130 S. Ct. at 2164.\n\nIn further explicating this prong, the Supreme Court noted \"the\n\npossibility that certain errors, termed 'structural errors,' might\n\n'affect substantial rights' regardless of their actual impact on an\n\nappellant's trial.\"      Id.\n\n            We have previously observed that \"[t]he [Supreme] Court\n\nhas classified an error as structural in only a very limited class\n\nof cases.\"    United States v. Fazal-Ur-Raheman-Fazal, 355 F.3d 40,\n\n48 (1st Cir. 2004)(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nExamples of structural errors that the Court has identified include\n\n\"complete denial of counsel, presence of a biased trial judge,\n\nracial discrimination in the selection of a grand jury, denial of\n\nself-representation      at    trial,    denial      of     a   public     trial,    and\n\noffering a defective reasonable doubt instruction.\"                    Id. (internal\n\ncitations    omitted).        As   we   do     not   find       that   the   ex   parte\n\ncommunications   constituted        such     \"structural         error,\"     we   assess\n\nwhether there is \"a reasonable probability that the error affected\n\nthe outcome of the trial.\"\n\n            Very few of these ex parte communications even arguably\n\naffected the outcome of the trial.                   Of the fifteen ex parte\n\ncommunications, only six were not placed on the record, and of\n\nthose six, only three jurors' information was incorrectly or\n\nincompletely communicated to the parties.                 Further, we cannot see\n\n\n                                        -42-\n\fhow, had the district judge correctly told the parties that Juror\n\nNo. 1's son was incarcerated in Florida rather than Connecticut,\n\nthe parties would have responded differently.             That leaves us with\n\nonly two jurors as the bases for Appellants' claim of substantial\n\nprejudice.\n\n            We find no reasonable probability that errors as to these\n\njurors affected the trial's outcome.        Appellants' argument asks us\n\nto make too many assumptions.          Juror No. 2 did not answer the\n\ndistrict judge's question about what kind of trial he was a witness\n\nin.    Yet Appellants ask us to assume that, had the district court\n\nmerely reported that he had been a witness in a criminal trial,\n\ncounsel would have followed up and successfully learned what kind\n\nof trial it was.       Counsel explicitly declined to ask any other\n\nquestions of the witness at the court's invitation.               Moreover, we\n\nmust   assume   that   the   juror   testified   in   a    drug   case,   which\n\nAppellants have not established. And we must assume that, although\n\nhe was a witness for the defense, Juror No. 2's participation in\n\nthis hypothetical drug case so biased him against the defense that\n\nhe affected the guilty verdict.        These guesses do not establish a\n\nreasonable probability that Juror No. 2's participation affected\n\nthe outcome of the trial.\n\n            Appellants make an equally attenuated argument regarding\n\nJuror No. 40, whose brother-in-law abused drugs.                   Appellants\n\nexercised a peremptory challenge and struck this juror.              Thus, to\n\n\n                                     -43-\n\fconclude that the court's mistake probably changed the outcome of\n\nthe trial, we must assume that Appellants would have moved to\n\nstrike this juror for cause and that the court would have granted\n\nthe motion.     We further must assume that Appellants would have\n\nexercised the peremptory they used for Juror No. 40 on another\n\njuror and that this other juror's replacement would have voted for\n\nan acquittal.\n\n          Because     of    the   highly   speculative    nature    of   these\n\ncounterfactuals and in light of the very strong evidence against\n\nthese   Appellants,    we     cannot   conclude    with    any     reasonable\n\nprobability that the district judge's omission regarding Juror No.\n\n40, along with the error the district judge made with respect to\n\nJuror No. 2, necessarily affected the outcome of the district court\n\nproceedings.    We do not, for example, have any basis in the record\n\nto conclude that the ex parte communications and what followed from\n\nthem violated Appellants' Sixth Amendment right to an impartial\n\njury or that any change in the jury composition -- whether or not\n\nit was impartial -- would have affected the outcome of the district\n\ncourt's proceedings.       Cf. United States v. González-Meléndez, 594\n\nF.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir. 2010)(\"[T]here is no basis in the record for\n\nconcluding that the alteration in jury composition had an injurious\n\ninfluence on the verdict.\").\n\n          Because Appellants cannot satisfy the third prong of the\n\nplain error test as articulated by the Supreme Court in Marcus,\n\n\n                                    -44-\n\fthey fail to satisfy the plain error test itself.              We thus need not\n\nreach the fourth prong, concerning whether \"the error seriously\n\naffect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\"      Marcus, 130 S. Ct. at 2164.\n\nD.   Arzola-Martínez's Allocution\n\n            We next address a claim concerning Arzola-Martínez's\n\nright to allocute during sentencing.              Arzola-Martínez argues that\n\nthe district court committed reversible error during his sentencing\n\nhearing    when   it    granted     him    the   opportunity   to   address    his\n\nobjections only to the PSR, a constraint which Arzola-Martínez\n\nargues violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(4)(A)(ii)\n\nin not permitting him a full, personal opportunity to speak or\n\npresent information to mitigate his sentence. Arzola-Martínez thus\n\nrequests   that    we   remand    his     case   to   the   district   court   for\n\nresentencing.\n\n            1.    Standard / Scope of Review\n\n            We review de novo a sentencing court's compliance with\n\nprocedural rules, including Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.\n\nUnited States v. Burgos-Andújar, 275 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            2.    Legal Framework\n\n            Federal     Rule   of    Criminal      Procedure    32(i)(4)(A)(ii)\n\nprovides that, before imposing a sentence, the court must \"address\n\nthe defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak\n\nor present any information to mitigate the sentence.\"                  Where the\n\n\n                                          -45-\n\fcourt   does     not   afford   a   defendant    this    opportunity     or    its\n\nfunctional equivalent, \"the reviewing court must remand the case\n\nfor   resentencing,      generally    without    needing      to   inquire    into\n\nprejudice.\" United States v. Catalán-Román, 585 F.3d 453, 475 (1st\n\nCir. 2009) (citing Burgos-Andújar, 274 F.3d at 28).\n\n            We have found that the right of allocution conferred to\n\ncriminal defendants by Rule 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) can be satisfied by its\n\n\"functional equivalent.\"        United States v. Mescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d\n\n1, 11 (1st Cir. 2004).          \"To achieve functional equivalency, the\n\ncourt, the prosecutor, and the defendant must at the very least\n\ninteract in a manner that shows clearly and convincingly that the\n\ndefendant knew he had a right to speak on any subject of his\n\nchoosing prior to the imposition of sentence.\"                Id. (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            3.    Analysis\n\n            During the sentencing hearing that the district judge\n\nconducted   with       Arzola-Martínez   on     July    28,   2008,   the    court\n\ndiscussed Arzola-Martínez's PSR with his counsel, Juan Pedrosa\n\n(\"Pedrosa\").      At the end of that discussion, during which Pedrosa\n\nraised several objections to the PSR, the court asked Pedrosa: \"So,\n\ncounsel, any other statements that you would be submitting on\n\nbehalf of your client?\"         Pedrosa responded: \"No, Your Honor, just\n\nfor allocution on his behalf.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -46-\n\f            After Pedrosa allocuted on behalf of Arzola-Martínez, the\n\ndistrict court stated that \"[Pedrosa] mentioned that [his] client\n\nwanted to address the court,\" and so asked Arzola-Martínez: \"Let me\n\nask you if you have any objections, any other objections or any\n\nobjections that you would like to discuss with the court, to the\n\ncontents of the [PSR]?\"            After taking issue with some portions of\n\nthe PSR, Arzola-Martínez argued that he was not guilty as a co-\n\nconspirator     in    Las     Avispas      Dos.   He    denied     knowing   certain\n\nwitnesses     or     having    visited      certain     places     crucial   to    his\n\nconviction.     After hearing Arzola-Martínez's statement, the court\n\nasked:   \"Any      other    statements[?]\"         Arzola-Martínez's         counsel\n\nresponded: \"No [y]our Honor.\"\n\n            From the record of he sentencing transcript, several\n\naspects of Arzola-Martínez's hearing are clear. The district judge\n\nprovided Pedrosa with the opportunity to speak or present any\n\ninformation     to    mitigate       the   sentence     of   his   client,   Arzola-\n\nMartínez, which Pedrosa then did, asserting that he was doing so on\n\nhis client's \"behalf.\"             The district judge then addressed Arzola-\n\nMartínez    personally        in    soliciting    any    objections    to    the   PSR\n\nspecifically, which Arzola-Martínez then provided and took the\n\nopportunity to broaden into more general comments about the facts\n\nalleged in the instant case.               Afterwards, in the context of this\n\nconversation between the district judge and Arzola-Martínez, the\n\ndistrict judge generally provided further opportunity to speak or\n\n\n                                           -47-\n\fpresent any information to mitigate the sentence by soliciting\n\n\"[a]ny other statements,\" an invitation that Pedrosa answered in\n\nthe negative on behalf of himself and his client. Although Pedrosa\n\nanswered this question, it may well have been directed to Arzola-\n\nMartínez.\n\n            We find that Arzola-Martínez was afforded the functional\n\nequivalent of the right to allocute during his sentencing hearing.\n\nThat the trial court did not address its final question to Pedrosa\n\nby name or otherwise seem to address the question to any particular\n\nperson supports the conclusion that the district court did not deny\n\nArzola-Martínez his allocution opportunity.     See Green v. United\n\nStates, 365 U.S. 301, 304 (1961) (finding that the district court\n\ndid not deny the defendant the allocution opportunity to which Rule\n\n32(a) entitled him where the trial judge's question, \"Did you want\n\nto say something?,\" without being addressed to any particular\n\nperson, \"may well have been directed to the defendant and not to\n\nhis counsel\"); see also Domenica v. United States, 292 F.2d 483,\n\n486 (1st Cir. 1961) (distinguishing Green, 365 U.S. 301, by noting\n\nthat in Domenica \"there can be no mistake [about to whom an\n\ninvitation for allocution was directed]. . . [because] the court's\n\nquestion was addressed to counsel by name\").    The totality of the\n\ncircumstances suggests to us that the interactions between the\n\ncourt, the prosecutor, and Arzola-Martínez \"show[] clearly and\n\nconvincingly that the defendant knew he had a right to speak on any\n\n\n                                -48-\n\fsubject of his choosing prior to the imposition of sentence.\"\n\nMescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d at 11.         We have held similarly in another\n\ncase where a criminal defendant was not explicitly invited by the\n\ndistrict court to speak on any subject of his choice.           See United\n\nStates v. O'Connell, 252 F.3d 524, 528 (1st Cir. 2001)(holding that\n\nthe record demonstrated \"clearly and convincingly\" that criminal\n\ndefendant \"knew of his right to speak prior to the imposition of\n\nhis sentence and that he took advantage of that opportunity by\n\ncommunicating those things that he found important to say\" where\n\ndefense counsel \"seized the opportunity before the district court\n\nhad the chance to address [the defendant] unprompted,\" \"expressed\n\nhis views on an appropriate sentence,\" and indicated that his\n\nclient would like to address the court, which the client then did).\n\nAccordingly, the district court committed no error concerning\n\nArzola-Martínez's allocution.\n\nE.   Rivera-Rodríguez's Sentencing Based on Drug Quantity\n     Responsibility\n\n            Rivera-Rodríguez argues that his sentence was based on an\n\nunreliable calculation of the quantity of drugs attributable to\n\nhim. Specifically, he contends, the district court committed clear\n\nerror in determining that the average weight of each crack capsule\n\nat   the   Borinquen   Ward   drug   point   was   0.075   grams,   as   this\n\ncalculation was unsubstantiated by the evidence presented at trial.\n\nThe district court, Rivera-Rodríguez argues, thus erroneously found\n\nhim responsible for a total of more than 4.5 kilograms of crack\n\n                                     -49-\n\fcocaine.12    Rivera-Rodríguez requests that we remand this issue to\n\nthe district court for resentencing.\n\n             1.   Standard / Scope of Review\n\n             \"We review the district court's factual finding as to\n\ndrug quantity for clear error.\"      United States v. Correa-Alicea,\n\n585 F.3d 484, 489 (1st Cir. 2009) (citation omitted); see also\n\nUnited States v. Feliciano-Rodríguez, 525 F.3d 85, 107 (1st Cir.\n\n2008)(\"A district court's factual finding regarding the amount of\n\ndrugs attributable to a member of a drug conspiracy will be\n\ndisturbed only if it is clearly erroneous.\"(citation omitted)). We\n\nhave found that, to determine drug quantity, a district court\n\n             looks to all acts that were part of the same\n             course of conduct or common scheme or plan as\n             the offense of conviction, and takes into\n             account not only what the defendant knew, but\n             what conduct he reasonably foresaw. . . .\n             Thus, each co-conspirator is responsible not\n             only for the drugs he actually handled but\n             also for the full amount of drugs that he\n             could reasonably have anticipated would be\n             within the ambit of the conspiracy. The trial\n             court's determination of drug quantity need\n             only be by a preponderance of the evidence and\n             is not required to be an exact determination\n             but rather only a reasoned estimate. Further,\n             if the trial court bases its estimate on one\n             of two plausible views, the determination is\n             not clearly erroneous.\n\n\n\n12\n   Rivera-Rodríguez does not challenge the mathematical formula and\nhypotheticals that the district court employed to conclude that if\na vial of crack cocaine weighed 0.075 grams, Rivera-Rodríguez would\nbe responsible for a total of more than 4.5 kilograms of crack\ncocaine. We thus focus only on Rivera-Rodríguez's challenge to the\naverage weight of each vial.\n\n                                  -50-\n\fFeliciano-Rodríguez,      525   F.3d    at    107     (internal       citations     and\n\nquotation   marks    omitted).         We    also     review    for    clear    error\n\nchallenges to factual findings made at sentencing.                    United States\n\nv. Shinderman, 515 F.3d 5, 18 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            2.    Factual Findings\n\n            José A. Mercado-Negrón (\"Mercado-Negrón\"), a chemist who\n\nhad worked twenty-six years for the Puerto Rico Forensic Science\n\nInstitute, where he analyzed controlled substances, including crack\n\ncocaine, testified at trial.            He stated that he had analyzed\n\ncontrolled substances in \"thousands of cases\" and had testified as\n\nan expert witness in federal court approximately five to six times\n\nand in state court hundreds of times.                   Mercado-Negrón further\n\nstated that, based on his experience analyzing crack cocaine seized\n\nin the area of Guayama, the average weight of a capsule of such\n\ncrack   cocaine    was   approximately        0.075    grams.         Based    on   his\n\ntestimony, the district court concluded that, in a given year, Las\n\nAvispas Dos could distribute 27 kilograms of crack cocaine and,\n\nthrough the life of the conspiracy, 109 kilograms of crack cocaine.\n\n            3.    Analysis\n\n            Rivera-Rodríguez makes much ado about the fact that\n\nMercado-Negrón did not personally weigh the capsules of crack\n\ncocaine distributed by Las Avispas Dos and instead relied on his\n\nexperience to provide his estimate of 0.075 grams per capsule.                       As\n\nRivera-Rodríguez points out, at trial, the only exhibit upon which\n\n\n                                       -51-\n\fMercado-Negrón relied was of powder cocaine, not crack cocaine.\n\nThat exhibit contained two bags of powder cocaine totaling 0.080\n\ngrams   that   Rivera-Rodríguez   sold   to   Luis    A.   Sepúlveda-Rivera\n\n(\"Officer Sepúlveda-Rivera\"), a member of the PRPD, in July 2006\n\nwhile    Officer     Sepúlveda-Rivera       was      working      undercover.\n\nFurthermore, Rivera-Rodríguez points to testimony of Rivera-Díaz in\n\nwhich Rivera-Díaz stated that he did not weigh the amounts of crack\n\ncocaine he placed into vials to be sold because he did not have the\n\nproper equipment to do so and because he did not pay attention to\n\nexactly what amount of crack cocaine he would measure and then\n\ndeposit into the vials.\n\n             We find that the district court did not clearly err in\n\nrelying on Mercado-Negrón's figure of 0.075 grams of crack cocaine\n\nper capsule even though Mercado-Negrón did not personally weigh the\n\ncapsules of crack cocaine at issue in this case.                 \"The court's\n\nfinding as to drug quantity was not a mere hunch or intuition, but\n\nwas a reasoned estimate based on reliable evidence in the record.\"\n\nCorrea-Alicea, 585 F.3d at 490 (internal citation and quotation\n\nmarks omitted).     The district court's reasoned estimate here was\n\nbased   on   Mercado-Negrón's   extensive     experience    as    a   forensic\n\nchemist specializing in controlled substances, including crack\n\ncocaine, for which he was admitted to testify at trial as an\n\nexpert, and he had previously analyzed crack cocaine seized from\n\nthe location in which Las Avispas Dos operated.            Rivera-Rodríguez\n\n\n                                  -52-\n\falso presented no developed argument about an alternative weight on\n\nwhich the district court could rely to formulate its calculations\n\nfor sentencing.      It was thus in the district court's discretion to\n\nrely on Mercado-Negrón's testimony in assessing the drug quantity\n\nfor which Rivera-Rodríguez was responsible.               See United States v.\n\nRivera-Maldonado, 194 F.3d 224, 228 n.2 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"The\n\nsentencing court possesses broad discretion in determining which\n\ndata   are   sufficiently    dependable         for    sentencing   purposes.\").\n\nIndeed, other circuits \"have endorsed other practices that yield\n\nonly very rough estimates of quantity.\"               United States v. Uwaeme,\n\n975 F.2d 1016, 1019 (4th Cir. 1992).\n\nF.   Arzola-Martínez's and Pabón-Mandrell's Sentencing Based on\n     Prior Criminal History\n\n             Arzola-Martínez      and    Pabón-Mandrell        argue   that    the\n\ndistrict court, in calculating their sentences, erroneously used\n\ntheir prior criminal histories.          Arzola-Martínez contends that the\n\ndistrict     court   improperly      used      his    prior   simple   possession\n\ndeferrals, which he argues never became final convictions, to apply\n\nthe three strikes mandatory life imprisonment provisions of 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A), 851, and 860. Pabón-Mandrell contends that\n\nthe district court improperly utilized his two simple possession\n\nnarcotics     convictions,     the    underlying        conduct   of   which   was\n\nspecifically included as an overt act of Count One, to apply the\n\nthree strikes mandatory life imprisonment provisions of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(b)(1)(A), 851, and 860.          Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell\n\n                                        -53-\n\fthus request that we set aside their sentences and remand their\n\ncases to the district court for resentencing.\n\n          The government responds that Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-\n\nMandrell's   sentences    should   be    affirmed   because   their   prior\n\nfelonies were sufficient under 21 U.S.C. § 851.               As discussed\n\nbelow, we agree.\n\n          1.   Standard / Scope of Review\n\n          We review de novo questions of the proper interpretation\n\nof statutes, including whether prior convictions count for purposes\n\nof 21 U.S.C. § 851.      See United States v. Lino, 493 F.3d 41, 43\n\n(1st Cir. 2007). To trigger \"a mandatory term of life imprisonment\n\nwithout release,\" 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) requires that the\n\ndefendant have \"two or more prior convictions for a felony drug\n\noffense\" and that those prior convictions \"have become final.\"\n\n          2.   Analysis\n\n                   a.    Arzola-Martínez's Sentencing\n\n          To support its determination that Arzola-Martínez was\n\nsubject to a life sentence under the provisions of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(A), the district court cited three instances in 2000 in\n\nwhich Arzola-Martínez was found in possession of marijuana and/or\n\ncrack cocaine. These arrests and related charges were processed by\n\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.        The cases were consolidated and,\n\nin 2001, upon Arzola-Martínez's guilty plea to the charges, the\n\nPuerto Rico Superior Court (\"PRSC\") placed Arzola-Martínez on\n\n\n                                   -54-\n\fprobation for a term of eighteen months under a rehabilitation\n\nprogram. Pursuant to a favorable 2002 report by the coordinator of\n\nArzola-Martínez's rehabilitation program, the PRSC expunged what\n\nthe PSR termed the \"conviction\" resulting from these incidents.\n\n           Arzola-Martínez argues that, contrary to the requirements\n\nof 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), none of these instances, which Arzola-\n\nMartínez characterizes as \"simple drug possession cases,\" qualify\n\nas a \"prior conviction[]\" that has \"become final.\" Arzola-Martínez\n\nbases this contention on his argument that, \"since no conviction\n\nnor finding of guilt was ever entered[,] no appeal could have been\n\ntaken.\"   To support this conclusion, Arzola-Martínez notes that he\n\nentered the rehabilitation program and the PRSC expunged the record\n\nof these two cases.   He further observes that Puerto Rico Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 247.1 provides that the rehabilitation program\n\nbe \"implemented without a finding of guilt\" and \"shall not be\n\ndeemed as a conviction.\"\n\n           Arzola-Martínez's arguments are unavailing.   The Supreme\n\nCourt and our circuit indicate that federal law and not, as Arzola-\n\nMartínez argues, Puerto Rico Rule of Criminal Procedure 247.1\n\ndetermines whether these instances constitute prior convictions\n\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 851.     Cf. Dickerson v. New Banner Inst., Inc.,\n\n460 U.S. 103, 111-12 (1983) (\"Whether one has been 'convicted'\n\nwithin the language of the gun control statutes is necessarily\n\n. . . a question of federal, not state, law, despite the fact that\n\n\n                                -55-\n\fthe predicate offense and its punishment are defined by the law of\n\nthe State. This makes for desirable national uniformity unaffected\n\nby   varying        state    laws,      procedures,      and    definitions    of\n\n'conviction.'\" (internal citations omitted)); United States v.\n\nBustamante, 706 F.2d 13, 14 (1st Cir. 1983) (describing the holding\n\nin Dickerson).       Although Dickerson and Bustamante related to the\n\nfederal gun control statute, we see no justification why their\n\nunderlying reasoning should not be applied, as here, to felony drug\n\noffenses.    Indeed, we have already cited the principles for which\n\nDickerson    and     Bustamante      stand     in   adjudicating    other   cases\n\ninvolving felony drug offenses.              See United States v. Cuevas, 75\n\nF.3d 778, 782 (1st Cir. 1996)(\"The decisions in Dickerson and\n\nBustamante still stand for the proposition that, absent legislative\n\nindication     to    the    contrary,    the   meaning   of    'conviction'   for\n\npurposes of a federal statutory scheme is to be determined under\n\nprevailing federal law.\"). Consequently, we find that the district\n\ncourt properly considered Arzola-Martínez's prior criminal history\n\nbased on federal -- not state -- law.\n\n            Moreover, we find that these incidents do constitute\n\n\"convictions\" for the purposes of 21 U.S.C. § 851.                 We agree with\n\nour sister courts of appeals that,\n\n            [f]or purposes of sentences imposed under\n            § 841, . . . Congress has not exempted from\n            the \"prior convictions\" that must be counted\n            those convictions removed from a criminal\n            record for policy reasons unrelated to\n            innocence or an error of law. The courts of\n\n                                        -56-\n\f             appeals that have considered this § 841\n             question therefore have counted prior felony\n             drug convictions even where those convictions\n             had been set aside, expunged, or otherwise\n             removed from a defendant's record for such\n             reasons.\n\nUnited States v. Law, 528 F.3d 888, 911 (D.C. Cir. 2008)(citing\n\ncases from the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and\n\nEleventh Circuits).         We thus find that Arzola-Martínez's prior\n\noffenses qualify as \"convictions\" pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851.\n\n                      b.   Pabón-Mandrell's Sentencing\n\n             On   March    30,   2005,    Pabón-Mandrell    was   arrested   for\n\nillegally possessing, with the intent to distribute, cocaine (\"the\n\n2005 incident\").       His conviction became final on June 20, 2006,\n\nwhen he was sentenced to probation.              Pabón-Mandrell argues that,\n\nwhen the government chose to include the 2005 incident as part of\n\nCount One,13 the government \"waived the right to claim the local\n\nconviction arising out of said incident as a predicate 'prior'\n\nconviction for purposes of qualifying [Pabón-Mandrell] as a third\n\nstrike offender.\"          Pabón-Mandrell bases this argument on our\n\nholding in United States v. De Jesús-Mateo that \"[p]rior felony\n\ndrug convictions will be counted separately for purposes of 21\n\nU.S.C.   §   841(b)    only      when    they   represent   distinct   criminal\n\n\n\n13\n   The indictment's section on \"Overt Acts in Furtherance of the\nConspiracy\" includes the following: \"On or about March 30, 2005,\n[Pabón-Mandrell] possessed a measurable amount of cocaine and\nmarihuana, in or around the area of a 'drug distribution point',\nlocated in Borinquen Ward, Guayama, PR.\"\n\n                                         -57-\n\fepisodes,\" 373 F.3d 70, 74 (1st Cir. 2004)(emphasis added)(citation\n\nomitted), and that the March 2005 incident was not a \"distinct\n\ncriminal   episode[]\"   from   the   charged   offense   in   Count   One.\n\nRegardless, the district court did include the 2005 incident in\n\nmaking its determination that the three strikes mandatory life term\n\napplied to Pabón-Mandrell.\n\n           The same case Pabón-Mandrell cites settles this matter.\n\nIn De Jesús Mateo, we held that our circuit's precedent forecloses\n\nthe argument that prior convictions do not represent \"distinct\n\ncriminal episodes\" when they are part and parcel of a defendant's\n\nparticipation in a drug trafficking conspiracy.          373 F.3d at 74\n\n(holding that prior convictions for separate drug transactions that\n\nwere eleven months apart constituted separate criminal episodes\n\neven though the conduct underlying both convictions was arguably\n\npart of the same conspiracy).        Our reasoning in De Jesús-Mateo\n\nrelied on an earlier ruling, in United States v. Martínez-Medina,\n\nin which we quoted a Ninth Circuit opinion stating that\n\n           [a]n ongoing course of criminal conduct such\n           as narcotics trafficking may involve many such\n           criminal episodes, each a discrete occurrence.\n           The fact that all are related, part of a\n           series, or part of a continuous course of\n           criminal dealing, does not necessarily render\n           them a \"single\" criminal episode, particularly\n           where the episodes occur over time.      To so\n           hold would insulate the very career criminals\n           the statute is designed to reach -- those\n           continuously engaged in criminal conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -58-\n\f279 F.3d 105, 123 (1st Cir. 2002)(quoting United States v. Maxey,\n\n989 F.2d 303, 307 (9th Cir. 1993)(holding that the district court\n\nproperly imposed a life sentence under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)\n\nbecause the defendant's prior convictions, although part of one\n\ndrug trafficking conspiracy, stemmed from several transactions\n\noccurring several months apart)).           We also have previously held\n\nthat \"[a] prior drug conviction constitutes a 'distinct criminal\n\nepisode' sufficient to trigger the enhancement so long as the\n\ndefendant continued to participate in drug activity after the\n\nconviction became final.\"        Lino, 493 F.3d at 43.\n\n            The   2005   incident,    despite   being   part    of   the   drug\n\nconspiracy of which Pabón-Mandrell was charged in the instant case,\n\nconstitutes a \"distinct criminal episode[]\" because Pabón-Mandrell\n\ncontinued to participate in drug activity after that conviction\n\nbecame final.      Rivera-Díaz and Brito-Pacheco testified at trial\n\nthat Pabón-Mandrell was the \"runner\" of heroin for Las Avispas Dos.\n\nIrving   Ofray-Vázquez     (\"Agent    Ofray-Vázquez\"),     an    FBI   agent,\n\ntestified during Pabón-Mandrell's sentencing hearing that Pabón-\n\nMandrell participated in the drug conspiracy charged in the instant\n\ncase even after he was convicted for the 2005 incident and put on\n\nprobation    in   June   2006.       Specifically,   Agent      Ofray-Vázquez\n\ntestified that, as late as December 2006, Pabón-Mandrell was still\n\na leader of Las Avispas Dos at the La Pluma drug point.                      As\n\nevidence to support this conclusion, Agent Ofray-Vázquez cited the\n\n\n                                     -59-\n\fstatement of a cooperating witness who reported that, in almost all\n\ncases, either Pabón-Mandrell or another man would pick up money\n\nfrom or take drugs to be sold at La Pluma.     Agent Ofray-Vázquez\n\nalso stated that further testimony provided to him by informants,\n\nincluding Rivera-Díaz, indicated that Pabón-Mandrell had a \"big\n\nrole\" in Las Avispas Dos from its inception in 2003 until law\n\nenforcement ceased its operations in 2007.     Agent Ofray-Vázquez\n\nalso testified that, even after June 2006, while he was conducting\n\nsurveillance on the areas, Agent Ofray-Vázquez \"always\" saw Pabón-\n\nMandrell at both the La Pluma and Las Vías drug points.\n\n          The mere fact that Pabón-Mandrell's conduct during the\n\nMarch 2005 incident was cited in the list of overt acts in the\n\ninstant case's indictment does not mean the government waived its\n\nassertion that the associated conviction was a prior conviction for\n\npurposes of qualifying Pabón-Mandrell as a third strike offender.\n\nAlthough there is no indication that the conduct leading to the\n\nprior convictions at issue in De Jesús-Mateo was listed in that\n\ncase's indictment, the distinction does not compel a different\n\noutcome here.   In De Jesús-Mateo, we explicitly noted the failure\n\nof the defendant's attempt to distinguish his case from Martínez-\n\nMedina on the basis that, in De Jesús-Mateo, \"the government\n\npresented evidence of marijuana trafficking . . . which was the\n\nsame conduct underlying De Jes[ú]s's prior marijuana conviction.\"\n\n373 F.3d at 75 n.3.   We observed that\n\n\n                               -60-\n\f            [t]he dispositive point here is not that\n            evidence of De Jes[ú]s distributing marijuana\n            was presented at his conspiracy trial but\n            rather that his prior cocaine conviction was a\n            separate criminal episode from his prior\n            marijuana conviction even though the conduct\n            underlying both convictions was arguably part\n            of the same conspiracy. As for any claim that\n            the conspiracy comprised the same episode as\n            either of the two prior convictions, the short\n            answer is that the conviction in this case was\n            for conspiring to distribute heroin and\n            cocaine, an episode continuing well beyond\n            either of the prior convictions for discrete\n            episodes of possession and distribution.\n\nId.   Similarly,    the   dispositive     point   here    is   not   that   an\n\nallegation   of   Pabón-Mandrell    possessing,    with    the   intent     to\n\ndistribute, cocaine was included as an overt act in the indictment\n\nin the instant case but rather that his prior cocaine conviction\n\nwas a separate criminal episode from his conspiracy conviction even\n\nthough the conduct underlying both convictions was arguably part of\n\nthe same conspiracy.      Pabón-Mandrell's conviction in the instant\n\ncase was for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute and\n\nactual distribution of narcotics, an episode continuing well beyond\n\nhis prior conviction for a discrete episode of possessing, with the\n\nintent to distribute, cocaine.\n\n            Both Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell also argue that\n\nat least one of the prior convictions that the district court\n\ncounted in sentencing each of them to the three strikes life terms\n\nshould not, in fact, count because the law's \"absurd result\" of\n\npunishing    \"cases of simple possession involving small amounts of\n\n\n                                   -61-\n\fdrugs\" is \"counter to Congressional intent\" to punish \"dangerous\n\nnarcotics traffickers.\"          While acknowledging that the \"literal\n\napplication of the language utilized in the statute may appear to\n\nforeclose any further analysis concerning its proper application\"\n\nhere,   to    support    their    contentions,    these     two   Appellants\n\nnonetheless cite the Supreme Court's decision in Green v. Bock\n\nLaundry Mach. Co., 490 U.S. 504, 510-11 (1989), in which the Court\n\nheld that a statute's literal interpretation can be ignored if it\n\n\"can't mean what it says\" (citation omitted).             See also id., 490\n\nU.S. at 527 (Scalia, J., concurring)(suggesting that the literal\n\ninterpretation of a statute can be ignored if it \"produces an\n\nabsurd, and perhaps unconstitutional, result\").            However, besides\n\npunishing    serious    drug   offenders,   we   have   observed    that   an\n\nadditional purpose of such a sentencing enhancement is to punish\n\nrecidivism.     See Lino, 493 F.3d at 43.          Such recidivism is a\n\nconcern with both of these Appellants, given that their prior\n\nconvictions and the instant case all relate to drug offenses.\n\n\"Indeed, if the rule advocated by [Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-\n\nMandrell] were adopted, we would insulate the very career criminals\n\nthe [enhancement] is designed to reach -- those continuously\n\nengaged in criminal conduct.\"       Id. at 43-44 (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (alterations in the original).            As such,\n\nimposing the three strikes life term on Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-\n\n\n\n\n                                    -62-\n\fMandrell    for   these   repeat    offenses   is   neither   absurd   nor   a\n\nviolation of Congressional intent.\n\n            In sum, we find that the district court did not err in\n\ncounting the aforementioned instances as \"prior convictions\" that\n\nled the district court to impose the three strikes life term on the\n\nfelony drug offense repeat offenders Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-\n\nMandrell.\n\n                             III.    Conclusion\n\n            We conclude that there was sufficient evidence adduced at\n\ntrial for the jury to convict Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and\n\nRivera-Moreno. We further conclude that the ex parte conversations\n\nthat the district judge held with prospective jurors were not plain\n\nerror.     Moreover, the district court did not err with respect to\n\nthe various sentencing claims made by Arzola-Martínez, Rivera-\n\nRodríguez, and Pabón-Mandrell.         Accordingly, the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -63-\n\f",

They advance a spate of claims in the process, including challenges to certain evidentiary rulings the district court made, challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence underlying their convictions, a challenge to the ex parte communications the district judge conducted with prospective jurors during voir dire, and challenges to the district court's sentencing process and outcomes. After careful review of the record, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion regarding the evidentiary rulings and that the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient for the jury to convict Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-Moreno. We also find that the ex parte conversations the district judge held with prospective jurors, though troubling, did not amount to plain error. Moreover, we find that the district court did not err when it provided Arzola-Martínez with the opportunity to allocute during sentencing or when it found Rivera-Rodríguez individually responsible for at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. Finally, we find that the district court committed no error concerning the prior criminal histories of Arzola-Martínez or Pabón-Mandrell when calculating their sentences. Given our findings, we affirm in all respects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background and Procedural History</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Indictment (2007)</h2>\n<p>On March 19, 2007, a grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico returned a two-count indictment against the five Appellants and thirty-seven other individuals. Count One of the indictment charged that, between an unknown date (\"but no later than in or about 2003\") and 2007, the group of forty-two defendants conspired to possess with intent to distribute and did distribute narcotics, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(a)(1), and 860.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Joint Trial and Appeal (2008)</h2>\n<p>Over the course of twelve days from February 11 to 27, 2008, Appellants were tried jointly. Appellants, witnesses, and the government referred to the drug trafficking organization of which Appellants were accused of being members as \"Las Avispas\" (in English, \"The Wasps\"). The original Las Avispas, Las Avispas Uno, operated in the Borinquen Ward of Guayama, Puerto Rico. After approximately forty-three members of Las Avispas Uno were arrested in 2002, the organization reconstituted itself in 2003 as Las Avispas Dos, also in the Borinquen Ward. Las Avispas Dos managed a drug distribution point, Las Vías, approximately 752 feet from the Luis Muñoz Elementary School (\"the School\"), which was operational at the time. Multiple witnesses testified at trial that Las Avispas Dos also operated a second drug distribution point, La Pluma.</p>\n<p>At trial, the government presented evidence that Appellants were each active members, if not leaders, of Las Avispas Dos, which conspired to distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine base (also known as crack cocaine), and marijuana. Evidence presented at trial also indicated that members of Las Avispas Dos, including some Appellants, (1) possessed firearms to ward off rival drug trafficking organizations and to maintain control over their drug distribution points and (2) killed and attempted to kill individuals to further intimidate and exert control. Among other things, the government specifically alleged that Rivera-Rodríguez and Muñiz-Massa, along with two indicted co-conspirators not appellants in this case, killed Ricardo Haddock-Collazo (\"Haddock-Collazo\"), on or about September 12, 2004, \"since they believed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*589</span> he was providing information about the drug distribution organization to law enforcement authorities.\"</p>\n<p>On the final day of the trial, the jury found each Appellant guilty as to Count One of the indictment. Furthermore, the jury unanimously agreed to the following findings, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) all Appellants conspired to possess with the intent to distribute fifty grams or more of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base (crack); (2) Muñiz-Massa, Pabón-Mandrell, and Rivera-Moreno conspired to possess with the intent to distribute one kilogram or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of heroin; (3) Arzola-Martínez and Rivera-Rodríguez conspired to possess with the intent to distribute less than one hundred grams of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of heroin; (4) all Appellants conspired to possess with the intent to distribute five kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine; (5) Muñiz-Massa, Pabón-Mandrell, Rivera-Moreno, and Rivera-Rodríguez conspired to possess with the intent to distribute one hundred kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana; (6) Arzola-Martínez conspired to possess with the intent to distribute less than one hundred kilograms of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana; and (7) all Appellants were involved in conspiracy and drug distribution activities that took place within 1,000 feet of a public and/or private school.</p>\n<p>Appellants were sentenced between May and July of 2008. On May 20, the district court sentenced Rivera-Rodríguez to a term of imprisonment of forty-three years followed by a term of supervised release of fifteen years. On May 30, the district court sentenced Muñiz-Massa to a term of imprisonment of sixty years followed by a term of supervised release of fifteen years. On June 6, the district court sentenced Pabón-Mandrell to a term of imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life followed by a term of supervised release of ten years. On June 25, the district court sentenced Rivera-Moreno to a term of imprisonment of thirty-five years followed by a term of supervised release of fifteen years. Finally, on July 28, the district court sentenced Arzola-Martínez to a term of imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life followed by a term of supervised release of fifteen years.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Between May and August of 2008, each Appellant filed his timely notice of appeal. Each Appellant raises multiple issues on appeal.<sup>[3]</sup> First, we address challenges by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*590</span> Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-Moreno to the district court's evidentiary rulings. Second, we consider the argument made by these three Appellants that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient for a jury to find them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. We then consider, under plain error review, whether the ex parte conversations that the district judge held with prospective jurors violated Appellants' Sixth Amendment rights. Finally, we evaluate various issues raised concerning the sentencing of Arzola-Martínez, Rivera-Rodríguez, and Pabón-Mandrell.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Evidentiary Rulings</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-Moreno claim that the district court made several erroneous evidentiary rulings at trial. We disagree. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in making the evidentiary rulings at issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's evidentiary rulings and <i>Brady</i> determinations for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d 36, 65 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Walter,</i> 434 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir.2006). We review <i>de novo</i> \"whether the strictures of the Confrontation Clause have been met.\" <i>Walter,</i> 434 F.3d at 33 (quoting <i>United States v. Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d 511, 522 (1st Cir.2005))(internal quotation marks omitted). \"Only rarelyand in extraordinarily compelling circumstanceswill we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" <i>Freeman v. Package Mach. Co.,</i> 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Analysis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Arzola-Martínez</h2>\n<p>Arzola-Martínez claims that the district court erred when it allowed the prosecution to present, as evidence of his membership in the conspiracy, a firearm and narcotics the police seized during separate arrests that he argues were unconnected to, even if they were contemporaneous with, the charged conspiracy. Arzola-Martínez argues that no evidence linked these events to the charged conspiracy, so admission of these events was improper character evidence under Rule 404(b) and prejudicial under Rule 403.</p>\n<p>Víctor Javier Veguilla-Figueroa (\"Officer Veguilla-Figueroa\"), a member of the Puerto Rico Police Department (\"PRPD\"), testified that, around 9:00 p.m. on October 13, 2005, a date which fell within the time frame of the charged conspiracy, he and two other PRPD police officers performing surveillance in Guayama received a communication over their radio that three individuals in a particular vehicle were armed and had threatened someone. Officer Veguilla-Figueroa stated that he and his colleagues identified and pursued the car, which initially refused to stop. When the vehicle finally did stop, Officer Veguilla-Figueroa placed the driver, Arzola-Martínez, under arrest and searched him, seizing a firearm.</p>\n<p>José A. Ortiz-Reyes (\"Officer Ortiz-Reyes\"), another PRPD member, testified that, around 2:20 p.m. on April 24, 2006, he and a fellow PRPD police officer performing preventive patrolling in Guayama observed a particular vehicle almost negligently collide with a second vehicle. Officer Ortiz-Reyes indicated to the driver of the first vehicle that he should stop. Instead, the vehicle fled, and Officer Ortiz-Reyes chased it. After the vehicle finally did stop, Officer Ortiz-Reyes approached it and observed on the back floor rug <span class=\"star-pagination\">*591</span> behind the seat of the passenger, whom Officer Ortiz-Reyes identified as Arzola-Martínez, a plastic ziplock bag containing plastic vials filled with powder that later tested positive for cocaine. The police then arrested Arzola-Martínez and the vehicle's driver.</p>\n<p>The police retrieved the gun from Arzola-Martínez, who possessed the weapon during the time and in the vicinity of the drug conspiracy. The police retrieved the narcotics from a car in which Arzola-Martínez was a passenger during the time and in the vicinity of the drug conspiracy. We have previously found that the presence of firearms and narcotics is probative of an intent to distribute narcotics. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rivera Calderón,</i> 578 F.3d 78, 94 (1st Cir.2009) (holding that a gun retrieved by police from a defendant who possessed the gun during the time and in the vicinity of a drug conspiracy \"clearly was relevant evidence\" and made it more probable that the defendant was a member of this particular conspiracy because, \"in drug trafficking[,] firearms have become `tools of the trade' and thus are probative of the existence of a drug conspiracy.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>see also United States v. Cannon,</i> 589 F.3d 514, 518-19 (1st Cir.2009). Because the events to which Officer Veguilla-Figueroa and Officer Ortiz-Reyes testified occurred at the time and in the vicinity of the conspiracy, and also because the evidence confiscated included \"tools of the trade\" used in the conspiracy, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimonies of Officer Veguilla-Figueroa and Officer Ortiz-Reyes as relevant to Arzola-Martínez's role in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Muñiz-Massa</h2>\n<p>As we discuss below, the district court did not abuse its discretion in making its rulings related to the first three of four evidentiary rulings Muñiz-Massa claims were erroneous, and we need not reach the fourth.</p>\n<p>First, Muñiz-Massa claims that the district court erred when it prevented him from fully cross-examining the criminal histories of Carlos Brito-Pacheco (\"Brito-Pacheco\") and José Rivera-Díaz (\"Rivera-Díaz\"), the government's two cooperating witnesses, for the purpose of impeaching them as witnesses against him. Muñiz-Massa argues that the district court's evidentiary ruling that prevented the defense from effectively cross-examining the government's two main witnesses as to their prior convictions and arrests unfairly infringed Muñiz-Massa's Confrontation Clause right under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>We have previously noted that</p>\n<blockquote>the right to cross-examination is not unbridled. So long as the trial court affords the defendant a fair opportunity for effective cross-examination, it may impose reasonable restrictions based on concerns such as undue prejudice, confusion of the issues, witness badgering, redundancy, or questioning that appears to be of marginal relevance. The trial court's latitude in shaping such restrictions is \"wide.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Molina,</i> 407 F.3d 511, 523 (1st Cir.2005) (internal citation omitted). Specifically, as relevant to Muñiz-Massa's claim, we have observed that district courts may exercise discretion in restricting a defendant's impeachment of a witness against him by limiting cross-examination of that witness's prior conduct. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bunchan,</i> 580 F.3d 66, 71 (1st Cir.2009)(finding no abuse of discretion in the district court's restriction of appellant's cross-examination regarding criminal charges pending against a witness where the district court found reference to the nature of the charged crime too prejudicial under Federal Rule of Evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*592</span> 403); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403; Fed. R.Evid. 608.</p>\n<p>At one point during cross-examination, defense counsel sought to show that Brito-Pacheco was in prison in 2004 and so could not have had first-hand knowledge of events concerning Las Avispas Dos during a portion of the time to which he testified. In front of the jury, defense counsel asked Brito-Pacheco if it was true that, after his release from prison on June 16, 2003, he was \"sent back to jail because [he] did not comply with the conditions [of his probation], right?\" On the government's objection that defense counsel's suggestion was not in good faith (because the government claimed the defense counsel knew that Brito-Pacheco was not, in fact, sent back to jail for violating the conditions of his probation) and would leave the jury with an incorrect impression about when Brito-Pacheco was incarcerated, the district court determined that Brito-Pacheco was, in fact, imprisoned from September 2002 to June 2003 and again from September 2005 through and including his testimony at trial in February 2008, and so was \"out on the streets\" in 2004.<sup>[4]</sup> After this review of Brito-Pacheco's criminal history, the defense counsel acknowledged \"[t]hat clears it up Your Honor\" and that he had \"no problem with that.\" At a later point during cross-examination, defense counsel, Brito-Pacheco, the district court, and the government engaged in the following dialogue:</p>\n<blockquote>[Defense counsel]: I would like to get a chronology of your arrests, convictions, revocations. You were first arrested back in the year 2000 what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Brito-Pacheco]: 2002</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Defense counsel]: Was that a drug charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[The government]: Objection, and we object as to the line of questioning being asked and answered as to the specific</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[The court]: The objection goes as to the nature of the charges. There has been testimony as to the arrests and sentences.</blockquote>\n<p>While Muñiz-Massa claims in his appellate brief that, at this point, the trial court \"prevented defense counsel from cross-examining the nature of the prior criminal charges presented against Brito-Pacheco,\" it is clear from the record that the trial court made no ruling either way on the government's objection and defense counsel did not seek to clarify or otherwise pursue the matter at trial. Instead, the district court permitted defense counsel, uninterrupted, to establish for the jury the dates during which Brito-Pacheco was incarcerated in order to make the point, in front of the jury, that Brito-Pacheco had \"no personal knowledge of anything that occurred in this case after September of 2005.\" We thus find that the district court allowed Muñiz-Massa \"a fair opportunity for effective cross-examination\" of Brito-Pacheco.</p>\n<p>With respect to Rivera-Díaz, defense counsel attempted to question the witness about whether he qualified for a reduction in the range of his sentencing for a previous arrest.<sup>[5]</sup> Rivera-Díaz responded during the cross-examination that he did not qualify for the sentence reduction. The defense counsel then sought to admit Rivera-Díaz's plea agreement about the prior arrest as an exhibit and to ask Rivera-Díaz why he did not qualify for the sentence reduction. On the government's objection that the prior conviction did not entail truthfulness or dishonesty, the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*593</span> court stated that it would not permit defense counsel's further questioning on the matter. The district court stated that the defense counsel's line of questioning was not in good faith because the attorney already knew that Rivera-Díaz did not qualify for the sentence reduction, and the exhibit could only mislead the jury into thinking otherwise.</p>\n<p>In another instance, defense counsel asked Rivera-Díaz to explain the criminal history category listed on his plea agreement. Rivera-Díaz responded that he could not explain the concept. On the government's objection to defense counsel continuing the line of questioning, the district court asked defense counsel to explain where the questioning was leading. Defense counsel responded that he intended to elicit from Rivera-Díaz that the criminal history category is based on the record of conviction and then to ask the witness about his prior conviction and government cooperation. The district court precluded the line of questioning because it concluded that the questioning was not to be used to explain the legal principles involved in various criminal history categories, as defense counsel claimed, but rather to introduce, indirectly, the witness's prior criminal convictions that were otherwise inadmissible. In sum, the district court, through the application of Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) and the balancing required by Federal Rule of Evidence 403, determined that cross-examination of the prior criminal conduct of Rivera-Díaz in these two instances was prohibited.</p>\n<p>As in <i>Bunchan, see id.</i> at 71, and as Muñiz-Massa acknowledges, the district judge did permit other cross-examination of each witness. Both witnesses were cross-examined on their drug sales and usage, and Brito-Pacheco was also cross-examined on the fact of his imprisonment from 2002 to 2003 and from 2005 until his testimony at trial and on his cooperation with the government in 2006. Any restriction of Muñiz-Massa's Confrontation rights was thus reasonable.</p>\n<p>Second, Muñiz-Massa contends that the district court erred when it allowed the government to present witness testimony through the use of leading questions. Muñiz-Massa argues that, at one point during cross-examination, Rivera-Díaz listed the members of Las Avispas but did not mention Muñiz-Massa, saying, after naming fourteen members, that he did not \"recall anybody else[ ] right off the top of my head.\" Muñiz-Massa argues that the prosecutor then, on redirect examination, had to lead the witness to elicit a response that included Muñiz-Massa in the membership of Las Avispas Dos. The prosecutor asked Rivera-Díaz \"what were the different roles of the members of Las Avispas, that you see here today?\" The district court overruled defense counsel's objection that the question went beyond his cross-examination, stating that, although defense counsel had not specifically inquired about the roles of Las Avispas Dos members, because Rivera-Díaz provided a description of roles in cross-examination from other attorneys, the district judge would allow the testimony. After the prosecutor asked \"out of the members of Las Avispas that are present here in court, what are their different roles?,\" Rivera-Díaz then identified Muñiz-Massa as a \"pusher,\" or \"seller,\" at Las Vías.</p>\n<p>In another instance, when the government asked Rivera-Díaz to \"identify which members of Las Avispas actually carried firearms with them,\" Rivera-Díaz did not include Muñiz-Massa in the list. The government then asked Rivera-Díaz: \"Are you aware of any of the members of Las Avispas that you have identified here in court today, that used to carry firearms?\" Defense counsel objected, stating that the prosecution \"is trying to jiggle the witness <span class=\"star-pagination\">*594</span> recollection.\" The district court overruled the objection, stating \"[t]he government may refresh his recollection, with a document or statements or asking him to look around.... [T]his morning we had to take a break because [Rivera-Díaz] had not eaten. So the government is entitled to probe, and refresh other things for this witness.\" The government then asked Rivera-Díaz: \"[L]ooking around in the courtroom and out of the members of Las Avispas that you have identified that are present here in court, are you aware if any of them used to carry firearms?\" Rivera-Díaz then identified, among others, Muñiz-Massa.</p>\n<p>We have found that any error in the prosecution's use of leading questions is harmless where there is no evidence that the leading questions prompted inaccurate testimony. <i>See </i><i>United States v. De León-Quiñones,</i> 588 F.3d 748, 756-57 (1st Cir. 2009). Here, the district court explained that it would permit the questions over defense counsel's objections because they were designed to elicit further information to which the witness previously testified and also because they were used to refresh recollection. Two days before both of the incidents described above, Rivera-Díaz had identified Muñiz-Massa as a \"seller\" for Las Avispas Dos who \"always had the pistol on him and he was always hanging out with [Rivera-Rodríguez].\" That testimony is consistent with Rivera-Díaz's testimony, in response to leading questions, two days later about Muñiz-Massa's membership in Las Avispas Dos and gun possession. We thus conclude that any error in allowing these leading questions was harmless and that there is no evidence that they prompted inaccurate testimony.</p>\n<p>Third, Muñiz-Massa argues that the district court erred when it admitted the testimony of Brito-Pacheco, a cooperating witness, about Muñiz-Massa's alleged admission that he participated in Haddock-Collazo's murder. Specifically, Muñiz-Massa claims that the government failed to disclose his inculpatory admission to the defense before the government presented Brito-Pacheco's testimony at trial. Muñiz-Massa argues that this disclosure was required pursuant to <i>Bruton v. United States,</i> 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), and its progeny, which held that \"a defendant is deprived of his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation when the facially incriminating confession of a nontestifying codefendant is introduced at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed to consider the confession only against the codefendant.\" <i>Richardson v. Marsh,</i> 481 U.S. 200, 207, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987)(citing <i>Bruton,</i> 391 U.S. at 135-36, 88 S.Ct. 1620). However, although Muñiz-Massa objected at trial to Brito-Pacheco's testimony about Muñiz-Massa's admission on hearsay grounds, Muñiz-Massa did not object on <i>Bruton</i> grounds. Muñiz-Massa thus waived any objection to this matter by not raising it at trial. <i>See </i><i>Campos-Orrego v. Rivera,</i> 175 F.3d 89, 95 (1st Cir.1999) (\"We have reiterated, with a regularity bordering on the echolalic, that a party's failure to advance an issue in the <i>nisi prius</i> court ordinarily bars consideration of that issue on appellate review.\"). Furthermore, even if Muñiz-Massa had raised this matter at trial, <i>Bruton</i> is inapplicable because the statement in question was his own, not that of a codefendant. The district court thus did not err in admitting Brito-Pacheco's testimony about Muñiz-Massa's alleged admission.</p>\n<p>Finally, Muñiz-Massa contends that the district court erred when it admitted photographic evidence of Haddock-Collazo's murdered body. Rule 403 gives trial courts broad discretion to reject evidence when its probative value is <i>substantially outweighed by</i> the danger of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*595</span> <i>unfair</i> prejudice. Fed.R.Evid. 403; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Smith,</i> 292 F.3d 90, 99 (1st Cir.2002). In a prosecution alleging that the defendants participated in a murder, the district court may conclude that photographic evidence of the murder helps the jury understand the nature and severity of the charged conduct and is not unfairly prejudicial. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cartano,</i> 420 F.2d 362, 364-65 (1st Cir. 1970); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Greatwalker,</i> 356 F.3d 908, 912-13 (8th Cir.2004). Even if the district court abused its discretion here, which we seriously doubt, any purported error was harmless in light of the other overwhelming evidence against Muñiz-Massa. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hicks,</i> 575 F.3d 130, 143 (1st Cir.2009) (\"We review non-constitutional evidentiary errors for harmlessness; an error is harmless if it is `highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.'\" (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. Rivera-Moreno</h2>\n<p>Rivera-Moreno claims that the government violated his rights protected by <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), when it failed to disclose the allegedly exculpatory testimony Rivera-Díaz provided during sentencing, which Rivera-Moreno claims contradicted testimony Rivera-Díaz provided during trial. Rivera-Moreno's claim concerns testimony Rivera-Díaz provided in an interview with a probation officer during the preparation of Rivera-Moreno's Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\").</p>\n<p>Rivera-Moreno concedes that \"[t]he government's obligations under <i>Brady</i> only extend to information in its possession, custody, or control.\" <i>United States v. Hall,</i> 434 F.3d 42, 55 (1st Cir.2006). Nevertheless, Rivera-Moreno contends that the government had a duty to learn and disclose the details of Rivera-Díaz's sentencing-related testimony. That, however, is not the law. \"While a prosecutor must disclose information maintained by government agents even if the prosecutor herself does not possess the information, this duty does not extend to information possessed by government agents not working with the prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted). Rivera-Díaz's sentencing-related testimony was maintained by the probation officer preparing the PSR, and there is no evidence that the federal prosecutor or any agent working on the U.S. Attorney's behalf had this information prior to or during trial. Accordingly, the government committed no <i>Brady</i> violation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</h2>\n<p>At the close of the government's case-in-chief, Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-Moreno each filed a timely motion for judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(a) (\"Rule 29 motion\"). The district court denied each of these motions and proceeded with closing arguments before submitting the case to the jury. On appeal, these three Appellants, although not challenging whether a drug conspiracy existed, claim that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient for a jury to find them guilty of participating in it.<sup>[6]</sup> These three Appellants thus request that we reverse their convictions and remand their cases to the district court for a new trial. We decline to do so. In this section, we consider whether the evidence discussed in the previous section, along with other evidence, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*596</span> could have led a reasonable jury to find each of these three Appellants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the conspiracy charged. We conclude that a reasonable jury could find Appellants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>We review the denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal <i>de novo. </i><i>Troy,</i> 583 F.3d at 24. In so doing,</p>\n<blockquote>we examine the evidence, both direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. We do not assess the credibility of a witness, as that is a role reserved for the jury. Nor need we be convinced that the government succeeded in eliminating every possible theory consistent with the defendant's innocence. Rather, we must decide whether that evidence, including all plausible inferences drawn therefrom, would allow a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\"We have described this standard of review as `formidable,' and defendants challenging convictions for insufficiency of evidence face an uphill battle on appeal.\" <i>United States v. Lipscomb,</i> 539 F.3d 32, 40 (1st Cir.2008) (internal citation, quotation marks, and brackets omitted). We have repeatedly emphasized, however, that, \"despite the prosecution-friendly overtones of the standard of review, appellate oversight of sufficiency challenges is not an empty ritual.\" <i>United States v. de</i><i> la Cruz-Paulino,</i> 61 F.3d 986, 999 n. 11 (1st Cir.1995) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Legal Framework</h2>\n<p>Appellants were charged with participating in a conspiracy to distribute drugs. We have previously found that,</p>\n<blockquote>[t]o establish that a conspiracy existed, the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant knowingly and voluntarily agreed with others to commit a particular crime. Such an agreement may be express or tacit, that is, represented by words or actions, and may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Rivera Calderón,</i> 578 F.3d at 88-89 (citations omitted); <i>United States v. Famania-Roche,</i> 537 F.3d 71, 78 (1st Cir.2008). \"To establish that the defendants belonged to and participated in the drug conspiracy, the government must show two kinds of intent: intent to agree and intent to commit the substantive offense.\" <i>United States v. Bristol-Mártir,</i> 570 F.3d 29, 39 (1st Cir.2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have also previously observed that \"[u]nder established case law, members of a conspiracy are substantively liable for the foreseeable criminal conduct of the other members of the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Hurley,</i> 63 F.3d 1, 22 (1st Cir.1995) (citing <i>Pinkerton v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946)). However, \"the government need not show that the conspirators knew all the details of the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Orrego-Martínez,</i> 575 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Analysis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Arzola-Martínez</h2>\n<p>Arzola-Martínez argues that evidence of what he claims were merely \"occasional\" sales of \"small\" amounts of cocaine to Rivera-Rodríguez was insufficient to warrant his conviction as a conspirator of Las Avispas Dos or to establish a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 860. Arzola-Martínez contends that the prosecution did not establish that he had a stake in the success of the retail sales made by the drug organization <span class=\"star-pagination\">*597</span> at the housing project or in its profits. Furthermore, Arzola-Martínez argues that, because there was no evidence that Arzola-Martínez sold cocaine to Rivera-Rodríguez near the School, the evidence was insufficient to convict him under 21 U.S.C. § 860.</p>\n<p>Arzola-Martínez's arguments miss the mark. We find that sufficient evidence was presented at trial for a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Arzola-Martínez was a conspirator of Las Avispas Dos and to establish his violation of 21 U.S.C. § 860. First, a former member of both Las Avispas Uno and Dos, Brito-Pacheco, testified that Arzola-Martínez was a member of Las Avispas Dos with whom he would \"sell drugs\" and \"shoot\" people. Brito-Pacheco further testified that Arzola-Martínez \"quite frequently\" sold cocaine in the Borinquen Ward to Rivera-Rodríguez in order for Rivera-Rodríguez to manufacture crack because the crack \"sells alot [sic] and makes alot [sic] of money.\"</p>\n<p>Second, as discussed above, Officer Veguilla-Figueroa testified that when he arrested Arzola-Martínez in 2005, Officer Veguilla-Figueroa seized a firearm from him. Third, also as discussed above, Officer Ortiz-Reyes testified that in 2006 Arzola-Martínez was a passenger in a car in which the police found plastic vials of a substance later shown to contain cocaine. A search of the vehicle conducted in the presence of both Arzola-Martínez and the driver also uncovered in the front glove compartment $468 in cash, which Arzola-Martínez told Officer Ortiz-Reyes belonged to him.</p>\n<p>We find that this direct and circumstantial evidence was sufficient to convict Arzola-Martínez of Count One. The testimony of these three witnesses about Arzola-Martínez's role, relationships, and activities in Las Avispas Dos was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Arzola-Martínez knowingly and voluntarily agreed with others to participate in Las Avispas Dos's drug-related activities. A reasonable jury could conclude from Brito-Pacheco's testimony that Arzola-Martínez was a member of Las Avispas Dos who engaged in drug dealing, shooting people, and supplying cocaine to Rivera-Rodríguez. A reasonable jury could infer from the testimony of Officer Veguilla-Figueroa and Officer Ortiz-Reyes that the firearm, cocaine, and cash they found on or with Arzola-Martínez were related to his participation in Las Avispas Dos. Not only, as discussed above, have we previously found the presence of drugs and guns to be probative of an intent to distribute narcotics, but we have also found lesser sums than that with which Arzola-Martínez was found to be \"substantial amounts [of cash]\" that, when discovered near narcotics in a vehicle, \"support the inference that the car's occupants were engaged in the sale, rather than casual use, of drugs.\" <i>Cannon,</i> 589 F.3d at 518.</p>\n<p>In order to convict Arzola-Martínez of the charged conspiracy, the government need not have established that Arzola-Martínez sold cocaine at a particular frequency or of a certain amount, or that he had a personal stake in the success of Las Avispas Dos's sales or profits. Rather, the government only had to prove that he was a member of the conspiracy and that the sales and profits were reasonably foreseeable to him. As discussed above, the government met that burden.</p>\n<p>The government, moreover, need not have established that Arzola-Martínez himself sold cocaine near the School, again so long as the government proved he was a member of the conspiracy and the location of those sales was reasonably foreseeable to him. According to a former member of Las Avispas Uno and Dos, Rivera-Díaz, Las Avispas Dos members would prepare <span class=\"star-pagination\">*598</span> crack in a house adjacent to the School. As discussed above, Las Vías, a drug distribution point Las Avispas Dos managed, was located approximately 752 feet from the School.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Muñiz-Massa</h2>\n<p>Muñiz-Massa claims that the evidence was \"insufficient to show [his] knowledge and/or participation in\" the conspiracy. In particular, Muñiz-Massa alleges that \"it was never clear on the record whether he was associated and part of the `Las V[í]as' or `La Pluma' drug organization or both.\"</p>\n<p>At trial, cooperating witness Brito-Pacheco testified that, like Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa was a member of Las Avispas Dos with whom he would \"sell drugs\" and \"shoot\" people. Brito-Pacheco specified that Muñiz-Massa sold drugs and was a \"runner\"<sup>[7]</sup> for Las Avispas Dos. Brito-Pacheco further testified that Muñiz-Massa was his partner in selling drugs in order to \"keep an eye on each other and to make money [for] both of us.\" Brito-Pacheco also stated that Muñiz-Massa told him that, in September 2004 and in furtherance of the charged conspiracy, Muñiz-Massa, along with Rivera-Rodríguez and three others, killed Haddock-Collazo, whom they suspected of cooperating with law enforcement's investigation of Las Avispas Dos. Brito-Pacheco helped dispose of the body. In his testimony at trial, Charles Alvarado-Dávila, a member of the PRPD, corroborated Brito-Pacheco's description of the date on which, and the location where, Haddock-Collazo's body was found, its condition, and, also consistent with Brito-Pacheco's testimony, that the body had been moved between two locations. At trial, a forensic pathologist testified that, through an autopsy she performed on his body, she determined Haddock-Collazo's cause of death to be from \"severe head trauma.\" This testimony was consistent with the description of the murder about which Brito-Pacheco testified that Muñiz-Massa had told him.</p>\n<p>Rivera-Díaz testified that, during the course of and related to the charged conspiracy, he saw Muñiz-Massa carry firearms. Rivera-Díaz stated that Muñiz-Massa \"would sell for [Las Avispas Dos].... He always had the pistol on him and he was always hanging out with [Rivera-Rodríguez].\"</p>\n<p>We find that this evidence was sufficient to convict Muñiz-Massa. The testimony of these four witnesses about Muñiz-Massa's role, relationships, and activities in Las Avispas Dos was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Muñiz-Massa knowingly and voluntarily agreed with others to participate in Las Avispas Dos's drug-related activities, engaged in drug dealing and, in furtherance of the conspiracy, violently confronted other people whom Muñiz-Massa perceived as a threat to the organization.</p>\n<p>As discussed above, multiple witnesses testified at trial that the single Las Avispas Dos organization operated two drug distribution points, called Las Vías and La Pluma. Las Avispas Dosand not Las Vías and La Plumawas the organization of which Muñiz-Massa and others were charged with being members. The jury could have reasonably concluded that Las Vías and La Pluma, both areas in the Borinquen Ward of Guayama, were merely locations of Las Avispas Dos's operations. The government need only to have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Muñiz-Massa was involved in Las Avispas Dos, irrespective of his involvement in a particular <span class=\"star-pagination\">*599</span> drug distribution point, and it did just that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. Rivera-Moreno</h2>\n<p>Rivera-Moreno claims that the record lacked \"any evidence or a reliable inference from any evidence to establish any intent or partial intent to enter into an agreement\" sufficient to convict him of the charged conspiracy. We find otherwise.</p>\n<p>According to Rivera-Díaz's testimony at trial, in 2003, he and other former members of Las Avispas Uno, including Rivera-Moreno (Rivera-Díaz's brother-in-law), met to discuss the establishment, management, and operation of Las Avispas Dos. Rivera-Díaz testified that, because Rivera-Moreno \"was the runner for the owner of [Las Avispas Uno] ... and he knew who to buy the drugs or heroin from,\" the group decided that Rivera-Moreno would \"stay in charge\" of Las Avispas Dos, which meant he would \"be the owner of the [drug distribution] point.\" Rivera-Díaz also testified that Rivera-Moreno would obtain heroin from a contact and then pass it along to other members of Las Avispas Dos who served as runners and distributors. Rivera-Díaz further testified to Rivera-Moreno's leadership role in Las Avispas Dos when the former stated that the latter \"ordered\" Las Avispas Dos members \"not to sell on Holy Friday\" and that the runner of heroin for Las Avispas Dos would give to Rivera-Moreno $9.00 of the $10.00 cost of each of 800 to 900 packages of heroin sold during each of three shifts per day.</p>\n<p>A second cooperating witness, Brito-Pacheco, corroborated Rivera-Díaz's testimony about Rivera-Moreno's participation in Las Avispas Dos, including Rivera-Moreno's role as the organization's heroin supplier. As he had done with Arzola-Martínez and Muñiz-Massa, Brito-Pacheco testified that he would \"sell drugs\" and \"shoot\" people with Rivera-Moreno.</p>\n<p>A third witness, César Alicea-Léon (\"Alicea-Léon\"), testified that, between 2003 and 2006, he distributed \"large amounts\" of heroin to Rivera-Moreno, whom Alicea-Léon stated \"was in charge\" of the drug distribution point in the Borinquen Ward.</p>\n<p>A fourth witness, Roberto Ayala-Vega (\"Officer Ayala-Vega\"), who worked in the PRPD's Tactical Division from 2005 to 2007, testified that on or about November 4, 2006 he was patrolling the Borinquen Ward when Rivera-Moreno and another person \"became aware of [his] patrol car.... They started running off and they dropped controlled substances....\" Field tests later revealed that the substances contained cocaine and heroin, which a trained and licensed chemist at the Puerto Rico Forensic Science Institute specializing in controlled substances corroborated in separate testimony. In the vehicle Rivera-Moreno and his associate abandoned, Officer Ayala-Vega found Rivera-Moreno's driver's license, Social Security card, and medical plan card.</p>\n<p>Rivera-Moreno argues that this evidence is insufficient because \"[t]he United States did not have available at trial any audio, video[,] or photograph depicting [him] doing any illegal act. Much less, we should consider that no firearms, monies, or drugs were either seized or observed in [his] immediate presence.\" However, as we have previously observed, \"[t]he fact that the government did not present certain kinds of evidence does not [necessarily] mean that there was insufficient evidence for conviction.\" <i>United States v. Liranzo,</i> 385 F.3d 66, 70 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>We find that the evidence presented was sufficient to convict Rivera-Moreno. The testimony of these four witnesses about Rivera-Moreno's role, relationships, and activities in Las Avispas Dos was sufficient for a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Rivera-Moreno knowingly and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*600</span> voluntarily agreed with others to participate in, if not also to lead, Las Avispas Dos's drug-related activities.</p>\n<p>In sum, a jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-Moreno were guilty of participating in the charged conspiracy. We have previously found similar evidence sufficient to sustain a drug-related conspiracy conviction. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Rodríguez-Lozada,</i> 558 F.3d 29, 39 (explaining that \"[t]he evidence is more than sufficient for a rational jury to find\" that defendant was part of a drug-trafficking conspiracy where there was evidence of defendant's drug-related relationships and drug-supplying activities).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Ex Parte Communications</h2>\n<p>A third claim concerns the process by which the district court conducted voir dire at trial. In their initial appellate briefs, Arzola-Martínez, Pabón-Mandrell, and Rivera-Rodríguez claimed that the district court committed plain error when it conducted individual, ex parte voir dire of prospective jurors, which these Appellants argue violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43(a)(2). Through supplemental briefing that we ordered during oral argument, which the parties filed after the district judge held a supplemental hearing on March 12, 2010 (\"the supplemental hearing\"), the other two Appellants, Muñiz-Massa and Rivera-Moreno, also asserted this claim, arguing that \"the method employed [was] the equivalent of depriving [A]ppellants of their Sixth Amendment constitutional right to a public trial and that they be present during all stages of the trial.\" Appellants thus request we find that the district court committed plain error by engaging in ex parte communications with prospective jurors and grant Appellants a new trial. The government responds that any ex parte conversations between the judge and jurors were not structural error and harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and, in any case, Appellants waived any objection to them by not raising the matter at trial. As discussed below, we find that the ex parte conversations that the district judge held with prospective jurors should be reviewed underand fail to satisfythe plain error standard.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>Neither Appellants nor the government objected to the ex parte communications described below at trial. The Supreme Court recently clarified the standard of review an appellate court must apply when considering a claim not raised at trial. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Marcus,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2159, 2164, 176 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2010). The Supreme Court observed that \"[Federal] Rule [of Criminal Procedure] 52(b) permits an appellate court to recognize a `plain error that affects substantial rights,' even if the claim of error was `not brought' to the district court's `attention.'\" <i>Id.; see also</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote>an appellate court may, in its discretion, correct an error not raised at trial only where the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an error; (2) the error is clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute; (3) the error affected the appellant's substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings; and (4) the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Marcus,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2164 (alteration in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>As discussed below, we assume arguendo that Appellants' claim satisfies the first and second prong of the Supreme Court's articulation of the plain error standard. However, because we do not find that Appellants' claim satisfies the third prong, we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*601</span> need not resolve the fourth prong, and Appellants' claim fails. Before engaging in our plain error review, we summarize the ex parte communications and the district court's rationale for them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Ex Parte Communications</h2>\n<p>Appellants claim, and the government does not refute, that the district court conducted ex parte examinations of fifteen prospective jurorsJuror Nos. 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 21, 23, 35, 40,<sup>[8]</sup> 41, 47, 58, 60, 64, and 66out of a total of seventy-one prospective jurors.<sup>[9]</sup>, <sup>[10]</sup> In other words, 21 percent of the prospective jurors were examined ex parte by the district court. Six of those prospective jurorsJuror Nos. 1, 2, 10, 23, 35, and 40were not excused by the district judge and thus were candidates for peremptory strike challenges. Four of those unexcused prospective jurorsJuror Nos. 10, 23, 35, and 40were struck by the defendants (the government did not strike any of them), leaving two of those prospective jurorsJuror Nos. 1 and 2 on the panel. As a result, 16.7 percent of the empaneled jurors were subjected to ex parte communications by the court during the voir dire process.</p>\n<p>The district judge employed various methods for memorializing these ex parte communications. For ex parte communications with nine of the fifteen prospective jurors (Juror Nos. 1, 2, 3,10, 13, 21, 23, 40, and 47), the court reporter was present and the trial transcript thus reflects the conversations between the district judge and the prospective jurors. For ex parte communications with six of the prospective jurors (Juror Nos. 35, 41, 58, 60,<sup>[11]</sup> 64, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*602</span> 66), the court reporter was not present and the trial transcript thus does not reflect the conversations between the district judge and the prospective jurors, or at least, in one of these cases (Juror No. 60), what the prospective juror said. After each of these six sets of unrecorded ex parte communications, the district judge provided a summary of the conversation, as reflected in the trial transcript.</p>\n<p>In the course of conducting these ex parte communications with prospective jurors, the district judge made at least two mistakes of fact and at least one significant omission when summarizing the prospective jurors' statements to counsel. The two mistakes of fact concerned Juror Nos. 1 and 2, both of whom, as noted above, were ultimately empaneled on the jury. The omission concerned Juror No. 40, who, as noted above, was later removed by a peremptory strike exercised by defense counsel.</p>\n<p>During the ex parte communication that the district judge held with Juror No. 1, that juror told the judge that his \"son is incarcerated in the state of <i>Florida</i> for a drug related charge\" (emphasis added). However, when summarizing the ex parte communication to counsel, the judge stated that this juror's \"son had a drug case for which he is incarcerated in the state of <i>Connecticut</i>\" (emphasis added). When asked whether either counsel wanted to question this juror, both parties did so briefly about a previous case in which the individual served as a juror. During the supplemental hearing, the district judge acknowledged that the state in which the juror's son was incarcerated \"may have been misstated\" but noted that \"the information that the individual had a son incarcerated for a conviction ... is correct.\"</p>\n<p>During the ex parte communication that the district judge held with Juror No. 2, the juror told the judge that he \"was a witness in court, in a <i>criminal case</i> for the defense\" (emphasis added). When asked by the judge if it was \"a <i>drug</i> case,\" the juror responded that \"[i]t was a <i>criminal state case</i>\" (emphasis added). However, when summarizing the ex parte communication to counsel, the judge stated that this juror \"served as a witness in a local court case, he was a witness for the defense and it was a <i>sex offender case.</i> He was a witness for the defense in a <i>criminal sex offender case</i>\" (emphasis added). When asked whether either counsel wanted to question this juror, both parties declined.</p>\n<p>During the ex parte communication that the district judge held with Juror No. 40, the juror told the judge: \"The brother of my wife has been a drug user for sometime [sic]. He is now in the mental ward, he has never been a [sic] accused or anything like that, but that is the situation.\" When asked by the judge \"[d]oes that affect your impartiality?,\" the juror responded \"[h]opefully not.\" The record indicates that this information was not conveyed to counsel, either during the judge's summaries of the ex parte communications to counsel or at any other time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. The District Court's Rationale for the Ex Parte Communications</h2>\n<p>The district judge explained, before conducting the ex parte communications, that she felt they were necessary \"to save time,\" because, given that the trial involved multiple defendants, \"having 12 attorneys moving into and out of the bench [would] be time consuming.\" The district judge stated at the beginning of voir dire <span class=\"star-pagination\">*603</span> that, after she heard all of the prospective jurors' excuses for not being empaneled, she would \"make a judgment call jointly with the attorneys.\" The district judge also stated that ex parte communications would enable prospective jurors to discuss \"personal matters\" with the judge that the jurors did not \"want to share ... publicly.\" It was thus the district courtnot one of the partiesthat, <i>sua sponte,</i> initiated ex parte communications.</p>\n<p>At the supplemental hearing, the district judge stated multiple times that the communications described above were all \"on the record,\" despite not occurring in the presence of counsel and some not being recorded by the court reporter. She justified her explanation by stating that \"notes were taken.\" The district court further stated that several of the communications are \"not an issue\" because the \"juror was excused for cause\" and thus \"never became a member of the jury panel.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Plain Error Review</h2>\n<p>As the government concedes, ex parte communications between the judge and the jury may raise concerns under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43(a) and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. <i>See </i><i>Presley v. Georgia,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 721, 724, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010) (holding that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial extends to voir dire); <i>United States v. Gagnon,</i> 470 U.S. 522, 528, 105 S.Ct. 1482, 84 L.Ed.2d 486 (1985)(explaining that the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause gives the defendant the right to be present and confront all witnesses and evidence against him and that the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause protects the right to be present \"in some situations where the defendant is not actually confronting witnesses or evidence against him\"); <i>Illinois v. Allen,</i> 397 U.S. 337, 338, 342-43, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970)(holding that the Sixth Amendment protects a defendant's right not to be completely excluded from voir dire); Fed. R.Crim.P. 43(a).</p>\n<p>Still, the defendant's right to be present during voir dire is not absolute; it must be balanced against the need to conduct a fair, safe, and orderly trial. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Presley,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 724-25 (noting that some circumstances may justify closing voir dire to the public); <i>Gagnon,</i> 470 U.S. at 526-27, 105 S.Ct. 1482 (noting that \"[t]he defense has no constitutional right to be present at every interaction between a judge and a juror\" and holding that the Due Process Clause only protects the accused's right to be present when his presence has a reasonably substantial relationship to the need to defend himself); <i>Allen,</i> 397 U.S. at 342-43, 90 S.Ct. 1057 (holding that a defendant, with disruptive behavior, may forfeit his Sixth Amendment right to be present); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Collazo-Aponte,</i> 216 F.3d 163, 182 (1st Cir.2000)(finding no Rule 43 violation when the defendant was \"restricted from full participation in a limited number of sidebar conferences that occurred during voir dire\").</p>\n<p>We assume arguendo that the first and second prongs of plain error review, as articulated in <i>Marcus,</i> are satisfied based on Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43(a) and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. We thus consider the third prong in more detail. The Supreme Court noted that, \"[i]n the ordinary case, to meet this [third prong] standard[,] an error must be `prejudicial,' which means that there must be a reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of the trial.\" <i>Marcus,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2164. In further explicating this prong, the Supreme Court noted \"the possibility that certain errors, termed `structural errors,' might `affect substantial rights' regardless of their actual impact on an appellant's trial.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*604</span> We have previously observed that \"[t]he [Supreme] Court has classified an error as structural in only a very limited class of cases.\" <i>United States v. Fazal-Ur-Raheman-Fazal,</i> 355 F.3d 40, 48 (1st Cir.2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Examples of structural errors that the Court has identified include \"complete denial of counsel, presence of a biased trial judge, racial discrimination in the selection of a grand jury, denial of self-representation at trial, denial of a public trial, and offering a defective reasonable doubt instruction.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted). As we do not find that the ex parte communications constituted such \"structural error,\" we assess whether there is \"a reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of the trial.\"</p>\n<p>Very few of these ex parte communications even arguably affected the outcome of the trial. Of the fifteen ex parte communications, only six were not placed on the record, and of those six, only three jurors' information was incorrectly or incompletely communicated to the parties. Further, we cannot see how, had the district judge correctly told the parties that Juror No. 1's son was incarcerated in Florida rather than Connecticut, the parties would have responded differently. That leaves us with only two jurors as the bases for Appellants' claim of substantial prejudice.</p>\n<p>We find no reasonable probability that errors as to these jurors affected the trial's outcome. Appellants' argument asks us to make too many assumptions. Juror No. 2 did not answer the district judge's question about what kind of trial he was a witness in. Yet Appellants ask us to assume that, had the district court merely reported that he had been a witness in a criminal trial, counsel would have followed up and successfully learned what kind of trial it was. Counsel explicitly declined to ask any other questions of the witness at the court's invitation. Moreover, we must assume that the juror testified in a drug case, which Appellants have not established. And we must assume that, although he was a witness for the defense, Juror No. 2's participation in this hypothetical drug case so biased him against the defense that he affected the guilty verdict. These guesses do not establish a reasonable probability that Juror No. 2's participation affected the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p>Appellants make an equally attenuated argument regarding Juror No. 40, whose brother-in-law abused drugs. Appellants exercised a peremptory challenge and struck this juror. Thus, to conclude that the court's mistake probably changed the outcome of the trial, we must assume that Appellants would have moved to strike this juror for cause and that the court would have granted the motion. We further must assume that Appellants would have exercised the peremptory they used for Juror No. 40 on another juror and that this other juror's replacement would have voted for an acquittal.</p>\n<p>Because of the highly speculative nature of these counterfactuals and in light of the very strong evidence against these Appellants, we cannot conclude with any reasonable probability that the district judge's omission regarding Juror No. 40, along with the error the district judge made with respect to Juror No. 2, necessarily affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. We do not, for example, have any basis in the record to conclude that the ex parte communications and what followed from them violated Appellants' Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury or that any change in the jury composition whether or not it was impartialwould have affected the outcome of the district court's proceedings. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. González-Meléndez,</i> 594 F.3d 28, 34 (1st <span class=\"star-pagination\">*605</span> Cir.2010)(\"[T]here is no basis in the record for concluding that the alteration in jury composition had an injurious influence on the verdict.\").</p>\n<p>Because Appellants cannot satisfy the third prong of the plain error test as articulated by the Supreme Court in <i>Marcus,</i> they fail to satisfy the plain error test itself. We thus need not reach the fourth prong, concerning whether \"the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Marcus,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2164.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Arzola-Martínez's Allocution</h2>\n<p>We next address a claim concerning Arzola-Martínez's right to allocute during sentencing. Arzola-Martínez argues that the district court committed reversible error during his sentencing hearing when it granted him the opportunity to address his objections only to the PSR, a constraint which Arzola-Martínez argues violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) in not permitting him a full, personal opportunity to speak or present information to mitigate his sentence. Arzola-Martínez thus requests that we remand his case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>We review <i>de novo</i> a sentencing court's compliance with procedural rules, including Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. <i>United States v. Burgos-Andújar,</i> 275 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Legal Framework</h2>\n<p>Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) provides that, before imposing a sentence, the court must \"address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence.\" Where the court does not afford a defendant this opportunity or its functional equivalent, \"the reviewing court must remand the case for resentencing, generally without needing to inquire into prejudice.\" <i>United States v. Catalán-Román,</i> 585 F.3d 453, 475 (1st Cir.2009) (citing <i>Burgos-Andújar,</i> 274 F.3d at 28).</p>\n<p>We have found that the right of allocution conferred to criminal defendants by Rule 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) can be satisfied by its \"functional equivalent.\" <i>United States v. Mescual-Cruz,</i> 387 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2004). \"To achieve functional equivalency, the court, the prosecutor, and the defendant must at the very least interact in a manner that shows clearly and convincingly that the defendant knew he had a right to speak on any subject of his choosing prior to the imposition of sentence.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Analysis</h2>\n<p>During the sentencing hearing that the district judge conducted with Arzola-Martínez on July 28, 2008, the court discussed Arzola-Martínez's PSR, with his counsel, Juan Pedrosa (\"Pedrosa\"). At the end of that discussion, during which Pedrosa raised several objections to the PSR, the court asked Pedrosa: \"So, counsel, any other statements that you would be submitting on behalf of your client?\" Pedrosa responded: \"No, Your Honor, just for allocution on his behalf.\"</p>\n<p>After Pedrosa allocuted on behalf of Arzola-Martínez, the district court stated that \"[Pedrosa] mentioned that [his] client wanted to address the court,\" and so asked Arzola-Martínez: \"Let me ask you if you have any objections, any other objections or any objections that you would like to discuss with the court, to the contents of the [PSR]?\" After taking issue with some portions of the PSR, Arzola-Martínez argued that he was not guilty as a co-conspirator in Las Avispas Dos. He denied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*606</span> knowing certain witnesses or having visited certain places crucial to his conviction. After hearing Arzola-Martínez's statement, the court asked: \"Any other statements[?]\" Arzola-Martínez's counsel responded: \"No [y]our Honor.\"</p>\n<p>From the record of he sentencing transcript, several aspects of Arzola-Martínez's hearing are clear. The district judge provided Pedrosa with the opportunity to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence of his client, Arzola-Martínez, which Pedrosa then did, asserting that he was doing so on his client's \"behalf.\" The district judge then addressed Arzola-Martínez personally in soliciting any objections to the PSR specifically, which Arzola-Martínez then provided and took the opportunity to broaden into more general comments about the facts alleged in the instant case. Afterwards, in the context of this conversation between the district judge and Arzola-Martínez, the district judge generally provided further opportunity to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence by soliciting \"[a]ny other statements,\" an invitation that Pedrosa answered in the negative on behalf of himself and his client. Although Pedrosa answered this question, it may well have been directed to Arzola-Martínez.</p>\n<p>We find that Arzola-Martínez was afforded the functional equivalent of the right to allocute during his sentencing hearing. That the trial court did not address its final question to Pedrosa by name or otherwise seem to address the question to any particular person supports the conclusion that the district court did not deny Arzola-Martínez his allocution opportunity. <i>See </i><i>Green v. United States,</i> 365 U.S. 301, 304, 81 S.Ct. 653, 5 L.Ed.2d 670 (1961) (finding that the district court did not deny the defendant the allocution opportunity to which Rule 32(a) entitled him where the trial judge's question, \"Did you want to say something?,\" without being addressed to any particular person, \"may well have been directed to the defendant and not to his counsel\"); <i>see also </i><i>Domenica v. United States,</i> 292 F.2d 483, 486 (1st Cir.1961) (distinguishing <i>Green,</i> 365 U.S. 301, 81 S.Ct. 653, by noting that in <i>Domenica</i> \"there can be no mistake [about to whom an invitation for allocution was directed]... [because] the court's question was addressed to counsel by name\"). The totality of the circumstances suggests to us that the interactions between the court, the prosecutor, and Arzola-Martínez \"show[] clearly and convincingly that the defendant knew he had a right to speak on any subject of his choosing prior to the imposition of sentence.\" <i>Mescual-Cruz,</i> 387 F.3d at 11. We have held similarly in another case where a criminal defendant was not explicitly invited by the district court to speak on any subject of his choice. <i>See </i><i>United States v. O'Connell,</i> 252 F.3d 524, 528 (1st Cir.2001)(holding that the record demonstrated \"clearly and convincingly\" that criminal defendant \"knew of his right to speak prior to the imposition of his sentence and that he took advantage of that opportunity by communicating those things that he found important to say\" where defense counsel \"seized the opportunity before the district court had the chance to address [the defendant] unprompted,\" \"expressed his views on an appropriate sentence,\" and indicated that his client would like to address the court, which the client then did). Accordingly, the district court committed no error concerning Arzola-Martínez's allocution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Rivera-Rodríguez's Sentencing Based on Drug Quantity Responsibility</h2>\n<p>Rivera-Rodríguez argues that his sentence was based on an unreliable calculation of the quantity of drugs attributable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*607</span> to him. Specifically, he contends, the district court committed clear error in determining that the average weight of each crack capsule at the Borinquen Ward drug point was 0.075 grams, as this calculation was unsubstantiated by the evidence presented at trial. The district court, Rivera-Rodríguez argues, thus erroneously found him responsible for a total of more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine.<sup>[12]</sup> Rivera-Rodríguez requests that we remand this issue to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>\"We review the district court's factual finding as to drug quantity for clear error.\" <i>United States v. Correa-Alicea,</i> 585 F.3d 484, 489 (1st Cir.2009) (citation omitted); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Feliciano Rodríguez,</i> 525 F.3d 85, 107 (1st Cir.2008)(\"A district court's factual finding regarding the amount of drugs attributable to a member of a drug conspiracy will be disturbed only if it is clearly erroneous.\" (citation omitted)). We have found that, to determine drug quantity, a district court</p>\n<blockquote>looks to all acts that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction, and takes into account not only what the defendant knew, but what conduct he reasonably foresaw.... Thus, each co-conspirator is responsible not only for the drugs he actually handled but also for the full amount of drugs that he could reasonably have anticipated would be within the ambit of the conspiracy. The trial court's determination of drug quantity need only be by a preponderance of the evidence and is not required to be an exact determination but rather only a reasoned estimate. Further, if the trial court bases its estimate on one of two plausible views, the determination is not clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Feliciano Rodríguez,</i> 525 F.3d at 107 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). We also review for clear error challenges to factual findings made at sentencing. <i>United States v. Shinderman,</i> 515 F.3d 5, 18 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Factual Findings</h2>\n<p>José A. Mercado-Negrón (\"Mercado-Negrón\"), a chemist who had worked twenty-six years for the Puerto Rico Forensic Science Institute, where he analyzed controlled substances, including crack cocaine, testified at trial. He stated that he had analyzed controlled substances in \"thousands of cases\" and had testified as an expert witness in federal court approximately five to six times and in state court hundreds of times. Mercado-Negrón further stated that, based on his experience analyzing crack cocaine seized in the area of Guayama, the average weight of a capsule of such crack cocaine was approximately 0.075 grams. Based on his testimony, the district court concluded that, in a given year, Las Avispas Dos could distribute 27 kilograms of crack cocaine and, through the life of the conspiracy, 109 kilograms of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Analysis</h2>\n<p>Rivera-Rodríguez makes much ado about the fact that Mercado-Negrón did not personally weigh the capsules of crack cocaine distributed by Las Avispas Dos and instead relied on his experience to provide his estimate of 0.075 grams per capsule. As Rivera-Rodríguez points out, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*608</span> at trial, the only exhibit upon which Mercado-Negrón relied was of powder cocaine, not crack cocaine. That exhibit contained two bags of powder cocaine totaling 0.080 grams that Rivera-Rodríguez sold to Luis A. Sepúlveda-Rivera (\"Officer Sepúlveda-Rivera\"), a member of the PRPD, in July 2006 while Officer Sepúlveda-Rivera was working undercover. Furthermore, Rivera-Rodríguez points to testimony of Rivera-Díaz in which Rivera-Díaz stated that he did not weigh the amounts of crack cocaine he placed into vials to be sold because he did not have the proper equipment to do so and because he did not pay attention to exactly what amount of crack cocaine he would measure and then deposit into the vials.</p>\n<p>We find that the district court did not clearly err in relying on Mercado-Negrón's figure of 0.075 grams of crack cocaine per capsule even though Mercado-Negrón did not personally weigh the capsules of crack cocaine at issue in this case. \"The court's finding as to drug quantity was not a mere hunch or intuition, but was a reasoned estimate based on reliable evidence in the record.\" <i>Correa-Alicea,</i> 585 F.3d at 490 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The district court's reasoned estimate here was based on Mercado-Negrón's extensive experience as a forensic chemist specializing in controlled substances, including crack cocaine, for which he was admitted to testify at trial as an expert, and he had previously analyzed crack cocaine seized from the location in which Las Avispas Dos operated. Rivera-Rodríguez also presented no developed argument about an alternative weight on which the district court could rely to formulate its calculations for sentencing. It was thus in the district court's discretion to rely on Mercado-Negrón's testimony in assessing the drug quantity for which Rivera-Rodríguez was responsible. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rivera-Maldonado,</i> 194 F.3d 224, 228 n. 2 (1st Cir.1999) (\"The sentencing court possesses broad discretion in determining which data are sufficiently dependable for sentencing purposes.\"). Indeed, other circuits \"have endorsed other practices that yield only very rough estimates of quantity.\" <i>United States v. Uwaeme,</i> 975 F.2d 1016, 1019 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. Arzola-Martínez's and Pabón-Mandrell's Sentencing Based on Prior Criminal History</h2>\n<p>Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell argue that the district court, in calculating their sentences, erroneously used their prior criminal histories. Arzola-Martínez contends that the district court improperly used his prior simple possession deferrals, which he argues never became final convictions, to apply the three strikes mandatory life imprisonment provisions of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A), 851, and 860. Pabón-Mandrell contends that the district court improperly utilized his two simple possession narcotics convictions, the underlying conduct of which was specifically included as an overt act of Count One, to apply the three strikes mandatory life imprisonment provisions of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A), 851, and 860. Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell thus request that we set aside their sentences and remand their cases to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p>The government responds that Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell's sentences should be affirmed because their prior felonies were sufficient under 21 U.S.C. § 851. As discussed below, we agree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>We review <i>de novo</i> questions of the proper interpretation of statutes, including whether prior convictions count for purposes of 21 U.S.C. § 851. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lino,</i> 493 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir. 2007). To trigger \"a mandatory term of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*609</span> life imprisonment without release,\" 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) requires that the defendant have \"two or more prior convictions for a felony drug offense\" and that those prior convictions \"have become final.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Analysis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Arzola-Martínez's Sentencing</h2>\n<p>To support its determination that Arzola-Martínez was subject to a life sentence under the provisions of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), the district court cited three instances in 2000 in which Arzola-Martínez was found in possession of marijuana and/or crack cocaine. These arrests and related charges were processed by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The cases were consolidated and, in 2001, upon Arzola-Martínez's guilty plea to the charges, the Puerto Rico Superior Court (\"PRSC\") placed Arzola-Martínez on probation for a term of eighteen months under a rehabilitation program. Pursuant to a favorable 2002 report by the coordinator of Arzola-Martínez's rehabilitation program, the PRSC expunged what the PSR termed the \"conviction\" resulting from these incidents.</p>\n<p>Arzola-Martínez argues that, contrary to the requirements of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), none of these instances, which Arzola-Martínez characterizes as \"simple drug possession cases,\" qualify as a \"prior conviction[]\" that has \"become final.\" Arzola-Martínez bases this contention on his argument that, \"since no conviction nor finding of guilt was ever entered[,] no appeal could have been taken.\" To support this conclusion, Arzola-Martínez notes that he entered the rehabilitation program and the PRSC expunged the record of these two cases. He further observes that Puerto Rico Rule of Criminal Procedure 247.1 provides that the rehabilitation program be \"implemented without a finding of guilt\" and \"shall not be deemed as a conviction.\"</p>\n<p>Arzola-Martínez's arguments are unavailing. The Supreme Court and our circuit indicate that federal law and not, as Arzola-Martínez argues, Puerto Rico Rule of Criminal Procedure 247.1 determines whether these instances constitute prior convictions under 21 U.S.C. § 851. <i>Cf. </i><i>Dickerson v. New Banner Inst., Inc.,</i> 460 U.S. 103, 111-12, 103 S.Ct. 986, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983) (\"Whether one has been `convicted' within the language of the gun control statutes is necessarily ... a question of federal, not state, law, despite the fact that the predicate offense and its punishment are defined by the law of the State. This makes for desirable national uniformity unaffected by varying state laws, procedures, and definitions of `conviction.'\" (internal citations omitted)); <i>United States v. Bustamante,</i> 706 F.2d 13, 14 (1st Cir.1983) (describing the holding in <i>Dickerson</i>). Although <i>Dickerson</i> and <i>Bustamante</i> related to the federal gun control statute, we see no justification why their underlying reasoning should not be applied, as here, to felony drug offenses. Indeed, we have already cited the principles for which <i>Dickerson</i> and <i>Bustamante</i> stand in adjudicating other cases involving felony drug offenses. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cuevas,</i> 75 F.3d 778, 782 (1st Cir.1996)(\"The decisions in <i>Dickerson</i> and <i>Bustamante</i> still stand for the proposition that, absent legislative indication to the contrary, the meaning of `conviction' for purposes of a federal statutory scheme is to be determined under prevailing federal law.\"). Consequently, we find that the district court properly considered Arzola-Martínez's prior criminal history based on federalnot state law.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we find that these incidents do constitute \"convictions\" for the purposes of 21 U.S.C. § 851. We agree with our sister courts of appeals that,</p>\n<blockquote>[f]or purposes of sentences imposed under § 841, ... Congress has not exempted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*610</span> from the \"prior convictions\" that must be counted those convictions removed from a criminal record for policy reasons unrelated to innocence or an error of law. The courts of appeals that have considered this § 841 question therefore have counted prior felony drug convictions even where those convictions had been set aside, expunged, or otherwise removed from a defendant's record for such reasons.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Law,</i> 528 F.3d 888, 911 (D.C.Cir.2008)(citing cases from the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits). We thus find that Arzola-Martínez's prior offenses qualify as \"convictions\" pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Pabón-Mandrell's Sentencing</h2>\n<p>On March 30, 2005, Pabón-Mandrell was arrested for illegally possessing, with the intent to distribute, cocaine (\"the 2005 incident\"). His conviction became final on June 20, 2006, when he was sentenced to probation. Pabón-Mandrell argues that, when the government chose to include the 2005 incident as part of Count One,<sup>[13]</sup> the government \"waived the right to claim the local conviction arising out of said incident as a predicate `prior' conviction for purposes of qualifying [Pabón-Mandrell] as a third strike offender.\" Pabón-Mandrell bases this argument on our holding in <i>United States v. De</i><i> Jesús Mateo</i> that \"[p]rior felony drug convictions will be counted separately for purposes of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) <i>only when</i> they represent distinct criminal episodes,\" 373 F.3d 70, 74 (1st Cir.2004)(emphasis added) (citation omitted), and that the March 2005 incident was not a \"distinct criminal episode[]\" from the charged offense in Count One. Regardless, the district court did include the 2005 incident in making its determination that the three strikes mandatory life term applied to Pabón-Mandrell.</p>\n<p>The same case Pabón-Mandrell cites settles this matter. In <i>De Jesús Mateo,</i> we held that our circuit's precedent forecloses the argument that prior convictions do not represent \"distinct criminal episodes\" when they are part and parcel of a defendant's participation in a drug trafficking conspiracy. 373 F.3d at 74 (holding that prior convictions for separate drug transactions that were eleven months apart constituted separate criminal episodes even though the conduct underlying both convictions was arguably part of the same conspiracy). Our reasoning in <i>De Jesús Mateo</i> relied on an earlier ruling, in <i>United States v. Martínez-Medina,</i> in which we quoted a Ninth Circuit opinion stating that</p>\n<blockquote>[a]n ongoing course of criminal conduct such as narcotics trafficking may involve many such criminal episodes, each a discrete occurrence. The fact that all are related, part of a series, or part of a continuous course of criminal dealing, does not necessarily render them a \"single\" criminal episode, particularly where the episodes occur over time. To so hold would insulate the very career criminals the statute is designed to reachthose continuously engaged in criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<p>279 F.3d 105, 123 (1st Cir.2002)(quoting <i>United States v. Maxey,</i> 989 F.2d 303, 307 (9th Cir.1993)(holding that the district court properly imposed a life sentence under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) because the defendant's prior convictions, although part of one drug trafficking conspiracy, stemmed from several transactions occurring several months apart)). We also have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*611</span> previously held that \"[a] prior drug conviction constitutes a `distinct criminal episode' sufficient to trigger the enhancement so long as the defendant continued to participate in drug activity after the conviction became final.\" <i>Lino,</i> 493 F.3d at 43.</p>\n<p>The 2005 incident, despite being part of the drug conspiracy of which Pabón-Mandrell was charged in the instant case, constitutes a \"distinct criminal episode[]\" because Pabón-Mandrell continued to participate in drug activity after that conviction became final. Rivera-Díaz and Brito-Pacheco testified at trial that Pabón-Mandrell was the \"runner\" of heroin for Las Avispas Dos. Irving Ofray-Vázquez (\"Agent Ofray-Vázquez\"), an FBI agent, testified during Pabón-Mandrell's sentencing hearing that Pabón-Mandrell participated in the drug conspiracy charged in the instant case even after he was convicted for the 2005 incident and put on probation in June 2006. Specifically, Agent Ofray-Vázquez testified that, as late as December 2006, Pabón-Mandrell was still a leader of Las Avispas Dos at the La Pluma drug point. As evidence to support this conclusion, Agent Ofray-Vázquez cited the statement of a cooperating witness who reported that, in almost all cases, either Pabón-Mandrell or another man would pick up money from or take drugs to be sold at La Pluma. Agent Ofray-Vázquez also stated that further testimony provided to him by informants, including Rivera-Díaz, indicated that Pabón-Mandrell had a \"big role\" in Las Avispas Dos from its inception in 2003 until law enforcement ceased its operations in 2007. Agent Ofray-Vázquez also testified that, even after June 2006, while he was conducting surveillance on the areas, Agent Ofray-Vázquez \"always\" saw Pabón-Mandrell at both the La Pluma and Las Vías drug points.</p>\n<p>The mere fact that Pabón-Mandrell's conduct during the March 2005 incident was cited in the list of overt acts in the instant case's indictment does not mean the government waived its assertion that the associated conviction was a prior conviction for purposes of qualifying Pabón-Mandrell as a third strike offender. Although there is no indication that the conduct leading to the prior convictions at issue in <i>De Jesús Mateo</i> was listed in that case's indictment, the distinction does not compel a different outcome here. In <i>De Jesús Mateo,</i> we explicitly noted the failure of the defendant's attempt to distinguish his case from <i>Martínez-Medina</i> on the basis that, in <i>De Jesús Mateo,</i> \"the government presented evidence of marijuana trafficking ... which was the same conduct underlying De Jes[ú]s's prior marijuana conviction.\" 373 F.3d at 75 n. 3. We observed that</p>\n<blockquote>[t]he dispositive point here is not that evidence of De Jes[ú]s distributing marijuana was presented at his conspiracy trial but rather that his prior cocaine conviction was a separate criminal episode from his prior marijuana conviction even though the conduct underlying both convictions was arguably part of the same conspiracy. As for any claim that the conspiracy comprised the same episode as either of the two prior convictions, the short answer is that the conviction in this case was for conspiring to distribute heroin and cocaine, an episode continuing well beyond either of the prior convictions for discrete episodes of possession and distribution.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> Similarly, the dispositive point here is not that an allegation of Pabón-Mandrell possessing, with the intent to distribute, cocaine was included as an overt act in the indictment in the instant case but rather that his prior cocaine conviction was a separate criminal episode from his conspiracy conviction even though the conduct underlying both convictions was arguably part of the same conspiracy. Pabón-Mandrell's conviction in the instant case <span class=\"star-pagination\">*612</span> was for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute and actual distribution of narcotics, an episode continuing well beyond his prior conviction for a discrete episode of possessing, with the intent to distribute, cocaine.</p>\n<p>Both Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell also argue that at least one of the prior convictions that the district court counted in sentencing each of them to the three strikes life terms should not, in fact, count because the law's \"absurd result\" of punishing \"cases of simple possession involving small amounts of drugs\" is \"counter to Congressional intent\" to punish \"dangerous narcotics traffickers.\" While acknowledging that the \"literal application of the language utilized in the statute may appear to foreclose any further analysis concerning its proper application\" here, to support their contentions, these two Appellants nonetheless cite the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Green v. Bock Laundry Mach. Co.,</i> 490 U.S. 504, 510-11, 109 S.Ct. 1981, 104 L.Ed.2d 557 (1989), in which the Court held that a statute's literal interpretation can be ignored if it \"can't mean what it says\" (citation omitted). <i>See also id.,</i> 490 U.S. at 527, 109 S.Ct. 1981 (Scalia, J., concurring)(suggesting that the literal interpretation of a statute can be ignored if it \"produces an absurd, and perhaps unconstitutional, result\"). However, besides punishing serious drug offenders, we have observed that an additional purpose of such a sentencing enhancement is to punish recidivism. <i>See </i><i>Lino,</i> 493 F.3d at 43. Such recidivism is a concern with both of these Appellants, given that their prior convictions and the instant case all relate to drug offenses. \"Indeed, if the rule advocated by [Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell] were adopted, we would insulate the very career criminals the [enhancement] is designed to reachthose continuously engaged in criminal conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 43-44 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in the original). As such, imposing the three strikes life term on Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell for these repeat offenses is neither absurd nor a violation of Congressional intent.</p>\n<p>In sum, we find that the district court did not err in counting the aforementioned instances as \"prior convictions\" that led the district court to impose the three strikes life term on the felony drug offense repeat offenders Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We conclude that there was sufficient evidence adduced at trial for the jury to convict Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-Moreno. We further conclude that the ex parte conversations that the district judge held with prospective jurors were not plain error. Moreover, the district court did not err with respect to the various sentencing claims made by Arzola-Martínez, Rivera-Rodríguez, and Pabón-Mandrell. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Count Two, relating to forfeiture of property upon a conviction under Count One, 21 U.S.C. § 853(a)(1) and (2), was dismissed at each Appellant's sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p>[2]  In the companion cases of <i>United States v. Cintrón-Echautegui,</i> 604 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2010), and <i>United States v. Rivera-Moreno,</i> 613 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2010), two co-conspirators in Las Avispas Dos pled guilty to the conspiracy count, and we affirmed the district court's judgments in each case.</p>\n<p>[3]  Besides the issues discussed here, Arzola-Martínez, Pabón-Mandrell, and Rivera-Rodríguez raised, in their initial brief, another issue, concerning the number of peremptory challenges the district court granted to the prosecution at trial. These Appellants argued that the district court committed plain error when it granted the prosecution twelve peremptory challenges, which these Appellants argued violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(b)(2). These Appellants thus requested that we find that the district court committed plain error and grant them a new trial. In supplemental appellate briefing that we ordered both parties to submit after oral argument, the government noted that, during a supplemental conference with the district court on March 12, 2010, \"[t]he district court and the trial attorneys (both for the government and defense) clarified that although the record says '12' only six (6) peremptory challenges were given to the government with two challenges for the 3 alternates.\" Appellants conceded the point during that conference, and so we do not address this issue further.</p>\n<p>[4]  The record is not clear about the nature of these two arrests and convictions. We can only glean that they were related to weapons charges.</p>\n<p>[5]  The record is not clear about the nature of this arrest. Defense counsel stated that it was for larceny but noted that Rivera-Díaz said it was drug-related.</p>\n<p>[6]  Arzola-Martínez and Muñiz-Massa also attack the credibility of witnesses who testified at trial as a basis for finding that the evidence was insufficient for a jury to find them guilty. However, \"[w]e do not assess the credibility of a witness, as that is a role reserved for the jury.\" <i>United States v. Troy,</i> 583 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We thus need not consider this matter.</p>\n<p>[7]  Rivera-Díaz testified that a runner \"is in charge of keeping the material in his house to then bring it over to the drug point and hand it over to the seller, and then to collect the monies and keep it for the owner of the material.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  An inconsistency exists in the record with respect to Juror No. 40. At one point during voir dire on February 11, 2008, Juror No. 40 is recorded as referring to \"my wife,\" whereas at another point on the same day the juror is recorded as referring to \"[m]y husband.\" Furthermore, despite the jury list indicating a female name for Juror No. 40, the district judge, during the supplemental hearing, referred to the prospective juror using the masculine pronoun and mentioned the juror's \"wife.\" The gender of the juror and the juror's spouse are irrelevant to our inquiry, so we need not resolve these matters.</p>\n<p>[9]  We derive the total number of prospective jurors from the district judge's list provided in Appellants' supplemental brief.</p>\n<p>[10]  In the cases of Juror Nos. 2 and 35, the trial transcript does not explicitly state that the conversations occurred \"[a]t the bench,\" as the trial transcripts of the other ex parte communications do.\n</p>\n<p>In the case of Juror No. 2, the district judge summarized the conversation when she summarized the ex parte communications she conducted with other prospective jurors, suggesting that the judge's communication with this juror was also ex parte. During the supplemental hearing, the district judge resolved this matter by acknowledging that the prospective juror \"was examined at the bench.\"</p>\n<p>In the case of Juror No. 35, the trial transcript reflects that that prospective juror stated his number and then that the district judge summarized what the prospective juror said. This portion of the transcript thus suggests that the district judge did conduct an unrecorded ex parte communication with this prospective juror.</p>\n<p>Given that (1) the district judge summarized the conversations she had with both Juror Nos. 2 and 35, as she did with the other thirteen prospective jurors with whom she conducted ex parte communications, (2) Appellants claim and the government does not refute that Juror Nos. 2 and 35 were subject to ex parte communications, and (3) the district judge concedes that at least the communication with Juror No. 2 was ex parte, we assume that both of these jurors were indeed among the prospective jurors questioned by the district judge outside the presence of counsel.</p>\n<p>[11]  In the case of Juror No. 60, the trial transcript omits what the prospective juror said, noting only that it was in Spanish. The trial transcript does, however, reflect what the district judge stated. Because the transcript of the district judge's statement is within the portion of the transcript noted as being \"[a]t the bench,\" and not \"[i]n open court,\" that suggests that, contrary to Appellants' claim, the court reporter was present and did transcribe the district judge's statement, but omitted the prospective juror's statement. The Spanish answers of Juror No. 60 could have been translated by the court reporter if proper procedure had been followed.</p>\n<p>[12]  Rivera-Rodríguez does not challenge the mathematical formula and hypotheticals that the district court employed to conclude that if a vial of crack cocaine weighed 0.075 grams, Rivera-Rodríguez would be responsible for a total of more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. We thus focus only on Rivera-Rodríguez's challenge to the average weight of each vial.</p>\n<p>[13]  The indictment's section on \"Overt Acts in Furtherance of the Conspiracy\" includes the following: \"On or about March 30, 2005, [Pabón-Mandrell] possessed a measurable amount of cocaine and marihuana, in or around the area of a `drug distribution point', located in Borinquen Ward, Guayama, PR.\"</p>\n\n</div>",

After careful review of the record, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion regarding the evidentiary rulings and that the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient for the jury to convict Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-Moreno. We also find that the ex parte conversations the district judge held with prospective jurors, though troubling, did not amount to plain error. Moreover, we find that the district court did not err when it provided Arzola-Martínez with the opportunity to allocute during sentencing or when it found Rivera-Rodríguez individually responsible for at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. Finally, we find that the district court committed no error concerning the prior criminal histories of Arzola-Martínez or Pabón-Mandrell when calculating their sentences. Given our findings, we affirm in all respects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background and Procedural History</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Indictment (2007)</h2>\n<p>On March 19, 2007, a grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico returned a two-count indictment against the five Appellants and thirty-seven other individuals. Count One of the indictment charged that, between an unknown date (\"but no later than in or about 2003\") and 2007, the group of forty-two defendants conspired to possess with intent to distribute and did distribute narcotics, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(a)(1), and 860.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Joint Trial and Appeal (2008)</h2>\n<p>Over the course of twelve days from February 11 to 27, 2008, Appellants were tried jointly. Appellants, witnesses, and the government referred to the drug trafficking organization of which Appellants were accused of being members as \"Las Avispas\" (in English, \"The Wasps\"). The original Las Avispas, Las Avispas Uno, operated in the Borinquen Ward of Guayama, Puerto Rico. After approximately forty-three members of Las Avispas Uno were arrested in 2002, the organization reconstituted itself in 2003 as Las Avispas Dos, also in the Borinquen Ward. Las Avispas Dos managed a drug distribution point, Las Vías, approximately 752 feet from the Luis Muñoz Elementary School (\"the School\"), which was operational at the time. Multiple witnesses testified at trial that Las Avispas Dos also operated a second drug distribution point, La Pluma.</p>\n<p>At trial, the government presented evidence that Appellants were each active members, if not leaders, of Las Avispas Dos, which conspired to distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine base (also known as crack cocaine), and marijuana. Evidence presented at trial also indicated that members of Las Avispas Dos, including some Appellants, (1) possessed firearms to ward off rival drug trafficking organizations and to maintain control over their drug distribution points and (2) killed and attempted to kill individuals to further intimidate and exert control. Among other things, the government specifically alleged that Rivera-Rodríguez and Muñiz-Massa, along with two indicted co-conspirators not appellants in this case, killed Ricardo Haddock-Collazo (\"Haddock-Collazo\"), on or about September 12, 2004, \"since they believed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*589</span> he was providing information about the drug distribution organization to law enforcement authorities.\"</p>\n<p>On the final day of the trial, the jury found each Appellant guilty as to Count One of the indictment. Furthermore, the jury unanimously agreed to the following findings, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) all Appellants conspired to possess with the intent to distribute fifty grams or more of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base (crack); (2) Muñiz-Massa, Pabón-Mandrell, and Rivera-Moreno conspired to possess with the intent to distribute one kilogram or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of heroin; (3) Arzola-Martínez and Rivera-Rodríguez conspired to possess with the intent to distribute less than one hundred grams of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of heroin; (4) all Appellants conspired to possess with the intent to distribute five kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine; (5) Muñiz-Massa, Pabón-Mandrell, Rivera-Moreno, and Rivera-Rodríguez conspired to possess with the intent to distribute one hundred kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana; (6) Arzola-Martínez conspired to possess with the intent to distribute less than one hundred kilograms of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana; and (7) all Appellants were involved in conspiracy and drug distribution activities that took place within 1,000 feet of a public and/or private school.</p>\n<p>Appellants were sentenced between May and July of 2008. On May 20, the district court sentenced Rivera-Rodríguez to a term of imprisonment of forty-three years followed by a term of supervised release of fifteen years. On May 30, the district court sentenced Muñiz-Massa to a term of imprisonment of sixty years followed by a term of supervised release of fifteen years. On June 6, the district court sentenced Pabón-Mandrell to a term of imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life followed by a term of supervised release of ten years. On June 25, the district court sentenced Rivera-Moreno to a term of imprisonment of thirty-five years followed by a term of supervised release of fifteen years. Finally, on July 28, the district court sentenced Arzola-Martínez to a term of imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life followed by a term of supervised release of fifteen years.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Between May and August of 2008, each Appellant filed his timely notice of appeal. Each Appellant raises multiple issues on appeal.<sup>[3]</sup> First, we address challenges by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*590</span> Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-Moreno to the district court's evidentiary rulings. Second, we consider the argument made by these three Appellants that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient for a jury to find them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. We then consider, under plain error review, whether the ex parte conversations that the district judge held with prospective jurors violated Appellants' Sixth Amendment rights. Finally, we evaluate various issues raised concerning the sentencing of Arzola-Martínez, Rivera-Rodríguez, and Pabón-Mandrell.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Evidentiary Rulings</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-Moreno claim that the district court made several erroneous evidentiary rulings at trial. We disagree. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in making the evidentiary rulings at issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's evidentiary rulings and <i>Brady</i> determinations for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v.

Analysis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Arzola-Martínez</h2>\n<p>Arzola-Martínez claims that the district court erred when it allowed the prosecution to present, as evidence of his membership in the conspiracy, a firearm and narcotics the police seized during separate arrests that he argues were unconnected to, even if they were contemporaneous with, the charged conspiracy. Arzola-Martínez argues that no evidence linked these events to the charged conspiracy, so admission of these events was improper character evidence under Rule 404(b) and prejudicial under Rule 403.</p>\n<p>Víctor Javier Veguilla-Figueroa (\"Officer Veguilla-Figueroa\"), a member of the Puerto Rico Police Department (\"PRPD\"), testified that, around 9:00 p.m. on October 13, 2005, a date which fell within the time frame of the charged conspiracy, he and two other PRPD police officers performing surveillance in Guayama received a communication over their radio that three individuals in a particular vehicle were armed and had threatened someone. Officer Veguilla-Figueroa stated that he and his colleagues identified and pursued the car, which initially refused to stop. When the vehicle finally did stop, Officer Veguilla-Figueroa placed the driver, Arzola-Martínez, under arrest and searched him, seizing a firearm.</p>\n<p>José A. Ortiz-Reyes (\"Officer Ortiz-Reyes\"), another PRPD member, testified that, around 2:20 p.m. on April 24, 2006, he and a fellow PRPD police officer performing preventive patrolling in Guayama observed a particular vehicle almost negligently collide with a second vehicle. Officer Ortiz-Reyes indicated to the driver of the first vehicle that he should stop. Instead, the vehicle fled, and Officer Ortiz-Reyes chased it. After the vehicle finally did stop, Officer Ortiz-Reyes approached it and observed on the back floor rug <span class=\"star-pagination\">*591</span> behind the seat of the passenger, whom Officer Ortiz-Reyes identified as Arzola-Martínez, a plastic ziplock bag containing plastic vials filled with powder that later tested positive for cocaine. The police then arrested Arzola-Martínez and the vehicle's driver.</p>\n<p>The police retrieved the gun from Arzola-Martínez, who possessed the weapon during the time and in the vicinity of the drug conspiracy. The police retrieved the narcotics from a car in which Arzola-Martínez was a passenger during the time and in the vicinity of the drug conspiracy. We have previously found that the presence of firearms and narcotics is probative of an intent to distribute narcotics. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rivera Calderón,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></span>, 94 (1st Cir.2009) (holding that a gun retrieved by police from a defendant who possessed the gun during the time and in the vicinity of a drug conspiracy \"clearly was relevant evidence\" and made it more probable that the defendant was a member of this particular conspiracy because, \"in drug trafficking[,] firearms have become `tools of the trade' and thus are probative of the existence of a drug conspiracy.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>see also United States v. Cannon,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span>, 518-19 (1st Cir.2009). Because the events to which Officer Veguilla-Figueroa and Officer Ortiz-Reyes testified occurred at the time and in the vicinity of the conspiracy, and also because the evidence confiscated included \"tools of the trade\" used in the conspiracy, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimonies of Officer Veguilla-Figueroa and Officer Ortiz-Reyes as relevant to Arzola-Martínez's role in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Muñiz-Massa</h2>\n<p>As we discuss below, the district court did not abuse its discretion in making its rulings related to the first three of four evidentiary rulings Muñiz-Massa claims were erroneous, and we need not reach the fourth.</p>\n<p>First, Muñiz-Massa claims that the district court erred when it prevented him from fully cross-examining the criminal histories of Carlos Brito-Pacheco (\"Brito-Pacheco\") and José Rivera-Díaz (\"Rivera-Díaz\"), the government's two cooperating witnesses, for the purpose of impeaching them as witnesses against him. Muñiz-Massa argues that the district court's evidentiary ruling that prevented the defense from effectively cross-examining the government's two main witnesses as to their prior convictions and arrests unfairly infringed Muñiz-Massa's Confrontation Clause right under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>We have previously noted that</p>\n<blockquote>the right to cross-examination is not unbridled. So long as the trial court affords the defendant a fair opportunity for effective cross-examination, it may impose reasonable restrictions based on concerns such as undue prejudice, confusion of the issues, witness badgering, redundancy, or questioning that appears to be of marginal relevance. The trial court's latitude in shaping such restrictions is \"wide.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Molina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201589\"><a href=\"/opinion/201589/united-states-v-vega-molina/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 523 (1st Cir.2005) (internal citation omitted). Specifically, as relevant to Muñiz-Massa's claim, we have observed that district courts may exercise discretion in restricting a defendant's impeachment of a witness against him by limiting cross-examination of that witness's prior conduct. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bunchan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203986\"><a href=\"/opinion/203986/united-states-v-bunchan/\"><span class=\"volume\">580</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 71 (1st Cir.2009)(finding no abuse of discretion in the district court's restriction of appellant's cross-examination regarding criminal charges pending against a witness where the district court found reference to the nature of the charged crime too prejudicial under Federal Rule of Evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*592</span> 403); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403; Fed. R.Evid. 608.</p>\n<p>At one point during cross-examination, defense counsel sought to show that Brito-Pacheco was in prison in 2004 and so could not have had first-hand knowledge of events concerning Las Avispas Dos during a portion of the time to which he testified. In front of the jury, defense counsel asked Brito-Pacheco if it was true that, after his release from prison on June 16, 2003, he was \"sent back to jail because [he] did not comply with the conditions [of his probation], right?\" On the government's objection that defense counsel's suggestion was not in good faith (because the government claimed the defense counsel knew that Brito-Pacheco was not, in fact, sent back to jail for violating the conditions of his probation) and would leave the jury with an incorrect impression about when Brito-Pacheco was incarcerated, the district court determined that Brito-Pacheco was, in fact, imprisoned from September 2002 to June 2003 and again from September 2005 through and including his testimony at trial in February 2008, and so was \"out on the streets\" in 2004.<sup>[4]</sup> After this review of Brito-Pacheco's criminal history, the defense counsel acknowledged \"[t]hat clears it up Your Honor\" and that he had \"no problem with that.\" At a later point during cross-examination, defense counsel, Brito-Pacheco, the district court, and the government engaged in the following dialogue:</p>\n<blockquote>[Defense counsel]: I would like to get a chronology of your arrests, convictions, revocations. You were first arrested back in the year 2000 what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Brito-Pacheco]: 2002</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Defense counsel]: Was that a drug charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[The government]: Objection, and we object as to the line of questioning being asked and answered as to the specific</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[The court]: The objection goes as to the nature of the charges. There has been testimony as to the arrests and sentences.</blockquote>\n<p>While Muñiz-Massa claims in his appellate brief that, at this point, the trial court \"prevented defense counsel from cross-examining the nature of the prior criminal charges presented against Brito-Pacheco,\" it is clear from the record that the trial court made no ruling either way on the government's objection and defense counsel did not seek to clarify or otherwise pursue the matter at trial. Instead, the district court permitted defense counsel, uninterrupted, to establish for the jury the dates during which Brito-Pacheco was incarcerated in order to make the point, in front of the jury, that Brito-Pacheco had \"no personal knowledge of anything that occurred in this case after September of 2005.\" We thus find that the district court allowed Muñiz-Massa \"a fair opportunity for effective cross-examination\" of Brito-Pacheco.</p>\n<p>With respect to Rivera-Díaz, defense counsel attempted to question the witness about whether he qualified for a reduction in the range of his sentencing for a previous arrest.<sup>[5]</sup> Rivera-Díaz responded during the cross-examination that he did not qualify for the sentence reduction. The defense counsel then sought to admit Rivera-Díaz's plea agreement about the prior arrest as an exhibit and to ask Rivera-Díaz why he did not qualify for the sentence reduction. On the government's objection that the prior conviction did not entail truthfulness or dishonesty, the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*593</span> court stated that it would not permit defense counsel's further questioning on the matter. The district court stated that the defense counsel's line of questioning was not in good faith because the attorney already knew that Rivera-Díaz did not qualify for the sentence reduction, and the exhibit could only mislead the jury into thinking otherwise.</p>\n<p>In another instance, defense counsel asked Rivera-Díaz to explain the criminal history category listed on his plea agreement. Rivera-Díaz responded that he could not explain the concept. On the government's objection to defense counsel continuing the line of questioning, the district court asked defense counsel to explain where the questioning was leading. Defense counsel responded that he intended to elicit from Rivera-Díaz that the criminal history category is based on the record of conviction and then to ask the witness about his prior conviction and government cooperation. The district court precluded the line of questioning because it concluded that the questioning was not to be used to explain the legal principles involved in various criminal history categories, as defense counsel claimed, but rather to introduce, indirectly, the witness's prior criminal convictions that were otherwise inadmissible. In sum, the district court, through the application of Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) and the balancing required by Federal Rule of Evidence 403, determined that cross-examination of the prior criminal conduct of Rivera-Díaz in these two instances was prohibited.</p>\n<p>As in <i>Bunchan, see id.</i> at 71, and as Muñiz-Massa acknowledges, the district judge did permit other cross-examination of each witness. Both witnesses were cross-examined on their drug sales and usage, and Brito-Pacheco was also cross-examined on the fact of his imprisonment from 2002 to 2003 and from 2005 until his testimony at trial and on his cooperation with the government in 2006. Any restriction of Muñiz-Massa's Confrontation rights was thus reasonable.</p>\n<p>Second, Muñiz-Massa contends that the district court erred when it allowed the government to present witness testimony through the use of leading questions. Muñiz-Massa argues that, at one point during cross-examination, Rivera-Díaz listed the members of Las Avispas but did not mention Muñiz-Massa, saying, after naming fourteen members, that he did not \"recall anybody else[ ] right off the top of my head.\" Muñiz-Massa argues that the prosecutor then, on redirect examination, had to lead the witness to elicit a response that included Muñiz-Massa in the membership of Las Avispas Dos. The prosecutor asked Rivera-Díaz \"what were the different roles of the members of Las Avispas, that you see here today?\" The district court overruled defense counsel's objection that the question went beyond his cross-examination, stating that, although defense counsel had not specifically inquired about the roles of Las Avispas Dos members, because Rivera-Díaz provided a description of roles in cross-examination from other attorneys, the district judge would allow the testimony. After the prosecutor asked \"out of the members of Las Avispas that are present here in court, what are their different roles?,\" Rivera-Díaz then identified Muñiz-Massa as a \"pusher,\" or \"seller,\" at Las Vías.</p>\n<p>In another instance, when the government asked Rivera-Díaz to \"identify which members of Las Avispas actually carried firearms with them,\" Rivera-Díaz did not include Muñiz-Massa in the list. The government then asked Rivera-Díaz: \"Are you aware of any of the members of Las Avispas that you have identified here in court today, that used to carry firearms?\" Defense counsel objected, stating that the prosecution \"is trying to jiggle the witness <span class=\"star-pagination\">*594</span> recollection.\" The district court overruled the objection, stating \"[t]he government may refresh his recollection, with a document or statements or asking him to look around.... [T]his morning we had to take a break because [Rivera-Díaz] had not eaten. So the government is entitled to probe, and refresh other things for this witness.\" The government then asked Rivera-Díaz: \"[L]ooking around in the courtroom and out of the members of Las Avispas that you have identified that are present here in court, are you aware if any of them used to carry firearms?\" Rivera-Díaz then identified, among others, Muñiz-Massa.</p>\n<p>We have found that any error in the prosecution's use of leading questions is harmless where there is no evidence that the leading questions prompted inaccurate testimony. <i>See </i><i>United States v. De León-Quiñones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204096\"><a href=\"/opinion/204096/united-states-v-de-leon-quinones/\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span>, 756-57 (1st Cir. 2009). Here, the district court explained that it would permit the questions over defense counsel's objections because they were designed to elicit further information to which the witness previously testified and also because they were used to refresh recollection. Two days before both of the incidents described above, Rivera-Díaz had identified Muñiz-Massa as a \"seller\" for Las Avispas Dos who \"always had the pistol on him and he was always hanging out with [Rivera-Rodríguez].\" That testimony is consistent with Rivera-Díaz's testimony, in response to leading questions, two days later about Muñiz-Massa's membership in Las Avispas Dos and gun possession. We thus conclude that any error in allowing these leading questions was harmless and that there is no evidence that they prompted inaccurate testimony.</p>\n<p>Third, Muñiz-Massa argues that the district court erred when it admitted the testimony of Brito-Pacheco, a cooperating witness, about Muñiz-Massa's alleged admission that he participated in Haddock-Collazo's murder. Specifically, Muñiz-Massa claims that the government failed to disclose his inculpatory admission to the defense before the government presented Brito-Pacheco's testimony at trial. Muñiz-Massa argues that this disclosure was required pursuant to <i>Bruton v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span> (1968), and its progeny, which held that \"a defendant is deprived of his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation when the facially incriminating confession of a nontestifying codefendant is introduced at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed to consider the confession only against the codefendant.\" <i>Richardson v. Marsh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 207, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1702</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span> (1987)(citing <i>Bruton,</i> 391 U.S. at 135-36, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1620</span></a></span>). However, although Muñiz-Massa objected at trial to Brito-Pacheco's testimony about Muñiz-Massa's admission on hearsay grounds, Muñiz-Massa did not object on <i>Bruton</i> grounds. Muñiz-Massa thus waived any objection to this matter by not raising it at trial. <i>See </i><i>Campos-Orrego v. Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198453\"><a href=\"/opinion/198453/campos-orrego-v-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir.1999) (\"We have reiterated, with a regularity bordering on the echolalic, that a party's failure to advance an issue in the <i>nisi prius</i> court ordinarily bars consideration of that issue on appellate review.\"). Furthermore, even if Muñiz-Massa had raised this matter at trial, <i>Bruton</i> is inapplicable because the statement in question was his own, not that of a codefendant. The district court thus did not err in admitting Brito-Pacheco's testimony about Muñiz-Massa's alleged admission.</p>\n<p>Finally, Muñiz-Massa contends that the district court erred when it admitted photographic evidence of Haddock-Collazo's murdered body. Rule 403 gives trial courts broad discretion to reject evidence when its probative value is <i>substantially outweighed by</i> the danger of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*595</span> <i>unfair</i> prejudice. Fed.R.Evid. 403; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199997\"><a href=\"/opinion/199997/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 99 (1st Cir.2002). In a prosecution alleging that the defendants participated in a murder, the district court may conclude that photographic evidence of the murder helps the jury understand the nature and severity of the charged conduct and is not unfairly prejudicial. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cartano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"287916\"><a href=\"/opinion/287916/united-states-v-anthony-cartano-aka-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 364-65 (1st Cir. 1970); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>United States v.

Even if the district court abused its discretion here, which we seriously doubt, any purported error was harmless in light of the other overwhelming evidence against Muñiz-Massa. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hicks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203949\"><a href=\"/opinion/203949/united-states-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, 143 (1st Cir.2009) (\"We review non-constitutional evidentiary errors for harmlessness; an error is harmless if it is `highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.'\" (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. Rivera-Moreno</h2>\n<p>Rivera-Moreno claims that the government violated his rights protected by <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span> (1963), when it failed to disclose the allegedly exculpatory testimony Rivera-Díaz provided during sentencing, which Rivera-Moreno claims contradicted testimony Rivera-Díaz provided during trial. Rivera-Moreno's claim concerns testimony Rivera-Díaz provided in an interview with a probation officer during the preparation of Rivera-Moreno's Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\").</p>\n<p>Rivera-Moreno concedes that \"[t]he government's obligations under <i>Brady</i> only extend to information in its possession, custody, or control.\" <i>United States v. Hall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202011\"><a href=\"/opinion/202011/united-states-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.2006). Nevertheless, Rivera-Moreno contends that the government had a duty to learn and disclose the details of Rivera-Díaz's sentencing-related testimony. That, however, is not the law. \"While a prosecutor must disclose information maintained by government agents even if the prosecutor herself does not possess the information, this duty does not extend to information possessed by government agents not working with the prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted). Rivera-Díaz's sentencing-related testimony was maintained by the probation officer preparing the PSR, and there is no evidence that the federal prosecutor or any agent working on the U.S. Attorney's behalf had this information prior to or during trial. Accordingly, the government committed no <i>Brady</i> violation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</h2>\n<p>At the close of the government's case-in-chief, Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-Moreno each filed a timely motion for judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(a) (\"Rule 29 motion\"). The district court denied each of these motions and proceeded with closing arguments before submitting the case to the jury. On appeal, these three Appellants, although not challenging whether a drug conspiracy existed, claim that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient for a jury to find them guilty of participating in it.<sup>[6]</sup> These three Appellants thus request that we reverse their convictions and remand their cases to the district court for a new trial. We decline to do so. In this section, we consider whether the evidence discussed in the previous section, along with other evidence, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*596</span> could have led a reasonable jury to find each of these three Appellants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the conspiracy charged. We conclude that a reasonable jury could find Appellants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>We review the denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal <i>de novo. </i><i>Troy,</i> 583 F.3d at 24. In so doing,</p>\n<blockquote>we examine the evidence, both direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. We do not assess the credibility of a witness, as that is a role reserved for the jury. Nor need we be convinced that the government succeeded in eliminating every possible theory consistent with the defendant's innocence. Rather, we must decide whether that evidence, including all plausible inferences drawn therefrom, would allow a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\"We have described this standard of review as `formidable,' and defendants challenging convictions for insufficiency of evidence face an uphill battle on appeal.\" <i>United States v.

Legal Framework</h2>\n<p>Appellants were charged with participating in a conspiracy to distribute drugs. We have previously found that,</p>\n<blockquote>[t]o establish that a conspiracy existed, the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant knowingly and voluntarily agreed with others to commit a particular crime. Such an agreement may be express or tacit, that is, represented by words or actions, and may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Rivera Calderón,</i> 578 F.3d at 88-89 (citations omitted); <i>United States v.

Analysis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Arzola-Martínez</h2>\n<p>Arzola-Martínez argues that evidence of what he claims were merely \"occasional\" sales of \"small\" amounts of cocaine to Rivera-Rodríguez was insufficient to warrant his conviction as a conspirator of Las Avispas Dos or to establish a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 860. Arzola-Martínez contends that the prosecution did not establish that he had a stake in the success of the retail sales made by the drug organization <span class=\"star-pagination\">*597</span> at the housing project or in its profits. Furthermore, Arzola-Martínez argues that, because there was no evidence that Arzola-Martínez sold cocaine to Rivera-Rodríguez near the School, the evidence was insufficient to convict him under 21 U.S.C. § 860.</p>\n<p>Arzola-Martínez's arguments miss the mark. We find that sufficient evidence was presented at trial for a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Arzola-Martínez was a conspirator of Las Avispas Dos and to establish his violation of 21 U.S.C. § 860. First, a former member of both Las Avispas Uno and Dos, Brito-Pacheco, testified that Arzola-Martínez was a member of Las Avispas Dos with whom he would \"sell drugs\" and \"shoot\" people. Brito-Pacheco further testified that Arzola-Martínez \"quite frequently\" sold cocaine in the Borinquen Ward to Rivera-Rodríguez in order for Rivera-Rodríguez to manufacture crack because the crack \"sells alot [sic] and makes alot [sic] of money.\"</p>\n<p>Second, as discussed above, Officer Veguilla-Figueroa testified that when he arrested Arzola-Martínez in 2005, Officer Veguilla-Figueroa seized a firearm from him. Third, also as discussed above, Officer Ortiz-Reyes testified that in 2006 Arzola-Martínez was a passenger in a car in which the police found plastic vials of a substance later shown to contain cocaine. A search of the vehicle conducted in the presence of both Arzola-Martínez and the driver also uncovered in the front glove compartment $468 in cash, which Arzola-Martínez told Officer Ortiz-Reyes belonged to him.</p>\n<p>We find that this direct and circumstantial evidence was sufficient to convict Arzola-Martínez of Count One. The testimony of these three witnesses about Arzola-Martínez's role, relationships, and activities in Las Avispas Dos was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Arzola-Martínez knowingly and voluntarily agreed with others to participate in Las Avispas Dos's drug-related activities. A reasonable jury could conclude from Brito-Pacheco's testimony that Arzola-Martínez was a member of Las Avispas Dos who engaged in drug dealing, shooting people, and supplying cocaine to Rivera-Rodríguez. A reasonable jury could infer from the testimony of Officer Veguilla-Figueroa and Officer Ortiz-Reyes that the firearm, cocaine, and cash they found on or with Arzola-Martínez were related to his participation in Las Avispas Dos. Not only, as discussed above, have we previously found the presence of drugs and guns to be probative of an intent to distribute narcotics, but we have also found lesser sums than that with which Arzola-Martínez was found to be \"substantial amounts [of cash]\" that, when discovered near narcotics in a vehicle, \"support the inference that the car's occupants were engaged in the sale, rather than casual use, of drugs.\" <i>Cannon,</i> 589 F.3d at 518.</p>\n<p>In order to convict Arzola-Martínez of the charged conspiracy, the government need not have established that Arzola-Martínez sold cocaine at a particular frequency or of a certain amount, or that he had a personal stake in the success of Las Avispas Dos's sales or profits. Rather, the government only had to prove that he was a member of the conspiracy and that the sales and profits were reasonably foreseeable to him. As discussed above, the government met that burden.</p>\n<p>The government, moreover, need not have established that Arzola-Martínez himself sold cocaine near the School, again so long as the government proved he was a member of the conspiracy and the location of those sales was reasonably foreseeable to him. According to a former member of Las Avispas Uno and Dos, Rivera-Díaz, Las Avispas Dos members would prepare <span class=\"star-pagination\">*598</span> crack in a house adjacent to the School. As discussed above, Las Vías, a drug distribution point Las Avispas Dos managed, was located approximately 752 feet from the School.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Muñiz-Massa</h2>\n<p>Muñiz-Massa claims that the evidence was \"insufficient to show [his] knowledge and/or participation in\" the conspiracy. In particular, Muñiz-Massa alleges that \"it was never clear on the record whether he was associated and part of the `Las V[í]as' or `La Pluma' drug organization or both.\"</p>\n<p>At trial, cooperating witness Brito-Pacheco testified that, like Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa was a member of Las Avispas Dos with whom he would \"sell drugs\" and \"shoot\" people. Brito-Pacheco specified that Muñiz-Massa sold drugs and was a \"runner\"<sup>[7]</sup> for Las Avispas Dos. Brito-Pacheco further testified that Muñiz-Massa was his partner in selling drugs in order to \"keep an eye on each other and to make money [for] both of us.\" Brito-Pacheco also stated that Muñiz-Massa told him that, in September 2004 and in furtherance of the charged conspiracy, Muñiz-Massa, along with Rivera-Rodríguez and three others, killed Haddock-Collazo, whom they suspected of cooperating with law enforcement's investigation of Las Avispas Dos. Brito-Pacheco helped dispose of the body. In his testimony at trial, Charles Alvarado-Dávila, a member of the PRPD, corroborated Brito-Pacheco's description of the date on which, and the location where, Haddock-Collazo's body was found, its condition, and, also consistent with Brito-Pacheco's testimony, that the body had been moved between two locations. At trial, a forensic pathologist testified that, through an autopsy she performed on his body, she determined Haddock-Collazo's cause of death to be from \"severe head trauma.\" This testimony was consistent with the description of the murder about which Brito-Pacheco testified that Muñiz-Massa had told him.</p>\n<p>Rivera-Díaz testified that, during the course of and related to the charged conspiracy, he saw Muñiz-Massa carry firearms. Rivera-Díaz stated that Muñiz-Massa \"would sell for [Las Avispas Dos].... He always had the pistol on him and he was always hanging out with [Rivera-Rodríguez].\"</p>\n<p>We find that this evidence was sufficient to convict Muñiz-Massa. The testimony of these four witnesses about Muñiz-Massa's role, relationships, and activities in Las Avispas Dos was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Muñiz-Massa knowingly and voluntarily agreed with others to participate in Las Avispas Dos's drug-related activities, engaged in drug dealing and, in furtherance of the conspiracy, violently confronted other people whom Muñiz-Massa perceived as a threat to the organization.</p>\n<p>As discussed above, multiple witnesses testified at trial that the single Las Avispas Dos organization operated two drug distribution points, called Las Vías and La Pluma. Las Avispas Dosand not Las Vías and La Plumawas the organization of which Muñiz-Massa and others were charged with being members. The jury could have reasonably concluded that Las Vías and La Pluma, both areas in the Borinquen Ward of Guayama, were merely locations of Las Avispas Dos's operations. The government need only to have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Muñiz-Massa was involved in Las Avispas Dos, irrespective of his involvement in a particular <span class=\"star-pagination\">*599</span> drug distribution point, and it did just that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. Rivera-Moreno</h2>\n<p>Rivera-Moreno claims that the record lacked \"any evidence or a reliable inference from any evidence to establish any intent or partial intent to enter into an agreement\" sufficient to convict him of the charged conspiracy. We find otherwise.</p>\n<p>According to Rivera-Díaz's testimony at trial, in 2003, he and other former members of Las Avispas Uno, including Rivera-Moreno (Rivera-Díaz's brother-in-law), met to discuss the establishment, management, and operation of Las Avispas Dos. Rivera-Díaz testified that, because Rivera-Moreno \"was the runner for the owner of [Las Avispas Uno] ... and he knew who to buy the drugs or heroin from,\" the group decided that Rivera-Moreno would \"stay in charge\" of Las Avispas Dos, which meant he would \"be the owner of the [drug distribution] point.\" Rivera-Díaz also testified that Rivera-Moreno would obtain heroin from a contact and then pass it along to other members of Las Avispas Dos who served as runners and distributors. Rivera-Díaz further testified to Rivera-Moreno's leadership role in Las Avispas Dos when the former stated that the latter \"ordered\" Las Avispas Dos members \"not to sell on Holy Friday\" and that the runner of heroin for Las Avispas Dos would give to Rivera-Moreno $9.00 of the $10.00 cost of each of 800 to 900 packages of heroin sold during each of three shifts per day.</p>\n<p>A second cooperating witness, Brito-Pacheco, corroborated Rivera-Díaz's testimony about Rivera-Moreno's participation in Las Avispas Dos, including Rivera-Moreno's role as the organization's heroin supplier. As he had done with Arzola-Martínez and Muñiz-Massa, Brito-Pacheco testified that he would \"sell drugs\" and \"shoot\" people with Rivera-Moreno.</p>\n<p>A third witness, César Alicea-Léon (\"Alicea-Léon\"), testified that, between 2003 and 2006, he distributed \"large amounts\" of heroin to Rivera-Moreno, whom Alicea-Léon stated \"was in charge\" of the drug distribution point in the Borinquen Ward.</p>\n<p>A fourth witness, Roberto Ayala-Vega (\"Officer Ayala-Vega\"), who worked in the PRPD's Tactical Division from 2005 to 2007, testified that on or about November 4, 2006 he was patrolling the Borinquen Ward when Rivera-Moreno and another person \"became aware of [his] patrol car.... They started running off and they dropped controlled substances....\" Field tests later revealed that the substances contained cocaine and heroin, which a trained and licensed chemist at the Puerto Rico Forensic Science Institute specializing in controlled substances corroborated in separate testimony. In the vehicle Rivera-Moreno and his associate abandoned, Officer Ayala-Vega found Rivera-Moreno's driver's license, Social Security card, and medical plan card.</p>\n<p>Rivera-Moreno argues that this evidence is insufficient because \"[t]he United States did not have available at trial any audio, video[,] or photograph depicting [him] doing any illegal act. Much less, we should consider that no firearms, monies, or drugs were either seized or observed in [his] immediate presence.\" However, as we have previously observed, \"[t]he fact that the government did not present certain kinds of evidence does not [necessarily] mean that there was insufficient evidence for conviction.\" <i>United States v. Liranzo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201265\"><a href=\"/opinion/201265/united-states-v-liranzo/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 70 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>We find that the evidence presented was sufficient to convict Rivera-Moreno. The testimony of these four witnesses about Rivera-Moreno's role, relationships, and activities in Las Avispas Dos was sufficient for a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Rivera-Moreno knowingly and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*600</span> voluntarily agreed with others to participate in, if not also to lead, Las Avispas Dos's drug-related activities.</p>\n<p>In sum, a jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-Moreno were guilty of participating in the charged conspiracy. We have previously found similar evidence sufficient to sustain a drug-related conspiracy conviction. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Rodríguez-Lozada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203687\"><a href=\"/opinion/203687/united-states-v-rodriguez-lozada/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 39 (explaining that \"[t]he evidence is more than sufficient for a rational jury to find\" that defendant was part of a drug-trafficking conspiracy where there was evidence of defendant's drug-related relationships and drug-supplying activities).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Ex Parte Communications</h2>\n<p>A third claim concerns the process by which the district court conducted voir dire at trial. In their initial appellate briefs, Arzola-Martínez, Pabón-Mandrell, and Rivera-Rodríguez claimed that the district court committed plain error when it conducted individual, ex parte voir dire of prospective jurors, which these Appellants argue violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43(a)(2). Through supplemental briefing that we ordered during oral argument, which the parties filed after the district judge held a supplemental hearing on March 12, 2010 (\"the supplemental hearing\"), the other two Appellants, Muñiz-Massa and Rivera-Moreno, also asserted this claim, arguing that \"the method employed [was] the equivalent of depriving [A]ppellants of their Sixth Amendment constitutional right to a public trial and that they be present during all stages of the trial.\" Appellants thus request we find that the district court committed plain error by engaging in ex parte communications with prospective jurors and grant Appellants a new trial. The government responds that any ex parte conversations between the judge and jurors were not structural error and harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and, in any case, Appellants waived any objection to them by not raising the matter at trial. As discussed below, we find that the ex parte conversations that the district judge held with prospective jurors should be reviewed underand fail to satisfythe plain error standard.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>Neither Appellants nor the government objected to the ex parte communications described below at trial. The Supreme Court recently clarified the standard of review an appellate court must apply when considering a claim not raised at trial. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Marcus,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"146982\"><a href=\"/opinion/146982/united-states-v-marcus/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2159</span></a></span>, 2164, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"146982\"><a href=\"/opinion/146982/united-states-v-marcus/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1012</span></a></span> (2010). The Supreme Court observed that \"[Federal] Rule [of Criminal Procedure] 52(b) permits an appellate court to recognize a `plain error that affects substantial rights,' even if the claim of error was `not brought' to the district court's `attention.'\" <i>Id.; see also</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote>an appellate court may, in its discretion, correct an error not raised at trial only where the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an error; (2) the error is clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute; (3) the error affected the appellant's substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings; and (4) the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Marcus,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2164 (alteration in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>As discussed below, we assume arguendo that Appellants' claim satisfies the first and second prong of the Supreme Court's articulation of the plain error standard. However, because we do not find that Appellants' claim satisfies the third prong, we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*601</span> need not resolve the fourth prong, and Appellants' claim fails. Before engaging in our plain error review, we summarize the ex parte communications and the district court's rationale for them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Ex Parte Communications</h2>\n<p>Appellants claim, and the government does not refute, that the district court conducted ex parte examinations of fifteen prospective jurorsJuror Nos. 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 21, 23, 35, 40,<sup>[8]</sup> 41, 47, 58, 60, 64, and 66out of a total of seventy-one prospective jurors.<sup>[9]</sup>, <sup>[10]</sup> In other words, 21 percent of the prospective jurors were examined ex parte by the district court. Six of those prospective jurorsJuror Nos. 1, 2, 10, 23, 35, and 40were not excused by the district judge and thus were candidates for peremptory strike challenges. Four of those unexcused prospective jurorsJuror Nos. 10, 23, 35, and 40were struck by the defendants (the government did not strike any of them), leaving two of those prospective jurorsJuror Nos. 1 and 2 on the panel. As a result, 16.7 percent of the empaneled jurors were subjected to ex parte communications by the court during the voir dire process.</p>\n<p>The district judge employed various methods for memorializing these ex parte communications. For ex parte communications with nine of the fifteen prospective jurors (Juror Nos. 1, 2, 3,10, 13, 21, 23, 40, and 47), the court reporter was present and the trial transcript thus reflects the conversations between the district judge and the prospective jurors. For ex parte communications with six of the prospective jurors (Juror Nos. 35, 41, 58, 60,<sup>[11]</sup> 64, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*602</span> 66), the court reporter was not present and the trial transcript thus does not reflect the conversations between the district judge and the prospective jurors, or at least, in one of these cases (Juror No. 60), what the prospective juror said. After each of these six sets of unrecorded ex parte communications, the district judge provided a summary of the conversation, as reflected in the trial transcript.</p>\n<p>In the course of conducting these ex parte communications with prospective jurors, the district judge made at least two mistakes of fact and at least one significant omission when summarizing the prospective jurors' statements to counsel. The two mistakes of fact concerned Juror Nos. 1 and 2, both of whom, as noted above, were ultimately empaneled on the jury. The omission concerned Juror No. 40, who, as noted above, was later removed by a peremptory strike exercised by defense counsel.</p>\n<p>During the ex parte communication that the district judge held with Juror No. 1, that juror told the judge that his \"son is incarcerated in the state of <i>Florida</i> for a drug related charge\" (emphasis added). However, when summarizing the ex parte communication to counsel, the judge stated that this juror's \"son had a drug case for which he is incarcerated in the state of <i>Connecticut</i>\" (emphasis added). When asked whether either counsel wanted to question this juror, both parties did so briefly about a previous case in which the individual served as a juror. During the supplemental hearing, the district judge acknowledged that the state in which the juror's son was incarcerated \"may have been misstated\" but noted that \"the information that the individual had a son incarcerated for a conviction ... is correct.\"</p>\n<p>During the ex parte communication that the district judge held with Juror No. 2, the juror told the judge that he \"was a witness in court, in a <i>criminal case</i> for the defense\" (emphasis added). When asked by the judge if it was \"a <i>drug</i> case,\" the juror responded that \"[i]t was a <i>criminal state case</i>\" (emphasis added). However, when summarizing the ex parte communication to counsel, the judge stated that this juror \"served as a witness in a local court case, he was a witness for the defense and it was a <i>sex offender case.</i> He was a witness for the defense in a <i>criminal sex offender case</i>\" (emphasis added). When asked whether either counsel wanted to question this juror, both parties declined.</p>\n<p>During the ex parte communication that the district judge held with Juror No. 40, the juror told the judge: \"The brother of my wife has been a drug user for sometime [sic]. He is now in the mental ward, he has never been a [sic] accused or anything like that, but that is the situation.\" When asked by the judge \"[d]oes that affect your impartiality?,\" the juror responded \"[h]opefully not.\" The record indicates that this information was not conveyed to counsel, either during the judge's summaries of the ex parte communications to counsel or at any other time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. The District Court's Rationale for the Ex Parte Communications</h2>\n<p>The district judge explained, before conducting the ex parte communications, that she felt they were necessary \"to save time,\" because, given that the trial involved multiple defendants, \"having 12 attorneys moving into and out of the bench [would] be time consuming.\" The district judge stated at the beginning of voir dire <span class=\"star-pagination\">*603</span> that, after she heard all of the prospective jurors' excuses for not being empaneled, she would \"make a judgment call jointly with the attorneys.\" The district judge also stated that ex parte communications would enable prospective jurors to discuss \"personal matters\" with the judge that the jurors did not \"want to share ... publicly.\" It was thus the district courtnot one of the partiesthat, <i>sua sponte,</i> initiated ex parte communications.</p>\n<p>At the supplemental hearing, the district judge stated multiple times that the communications described above were all \"on the record,\" despite not occurring in the presence of counsel and some not being recorded by the court reporter. She justified her explanation by stating that \"notes were taken.\" The district court further stated that several of the communications are \"not an issue\" because the \"juror was excused for cause\" and thus \"never became a member of the jury panel.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4.

We thus consider the third prong in more detail. The Supreme Court noted that, \"[i]n the ordinary case, to meet this [third prong] standard[,] an error must be `prejudicial,' which means that there must be a reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of the trial.\" <i>Marcus,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2164. In further explicating this prong, the Supreme Court noted \"the possibility that certain errors, termed `structural errors,' might `affect substantial rights' regardless of their actual impact on an appellant's trial.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*604</span> We have previously observed that \"[t]he [Supreme] Court has classified an error as structural in only a very limited class of cases.\" <i>United States v. Fazal-Ur-Raheman-Fazal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200819\"><a href=\"/opinion/200819/united-states-v-raheman-fazal/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Examples of structural errors that the Court has identified include \"complete denial of counsel, presence of a biased trial judge, racial discrimination in the selection of a grand jury, denial of self-representation at trial, denial of a public trial, and offering a defective reasonable doubt instruction.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted). As we do not find that the ex parte communications constituted such \"structural error,\" we assess whether there is \"a reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of the trial.\"</p>\n<p>Very few of these ex parte communications even arguably affected the outcome of the trial. Of the fifteen ex parte communications, only six were not placed on the record, and of those six, only three jurors' information was incorrectly or incompletely communicated to the parties. Further, we cannot see how, had the district judge correctly told the parties that Juror No. 1's son was incarcerated in Florida rather than Connecticut, the parties would have responded differently. That leaves us with only two jurors as the bases for Appellants' claim of substantial prejudice.</p>\n<p>We find no reasonable probability that errors as to these jurors affected the trial's outcome. Appellants' argument asks us to make too many assumptions. Juror No. 2 did not answer the district judge's question about what kind of trial he was a witness in. Yet Appellants ask us to assume that, had the district court merely reported that he had been a witness in a criminal trial, counsel would have followed up and successfully learned what kind of trial it was. Counsel explicitly declined to ask any other questions of the witness at the court's invitation. Moreover, we must assume that the juror testified in a drug case, which Appellants have not established. And we must assume that, although he was a witness for the defense, Juror No. 2's participation in this hypothetical drug case so biased him against the defense that he affected the guilty verdict. These guesses do not establish a reasonable probability that Juror No. 2's participation affected the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p>Appellants make an equally attenuated argument regarding Juror No. 40, whose brother-in-law abused drugs. Appellants exercised a peremptory challenge and struck this juror. Thus, to conclude that the court's mistake probably changed the outcome of the trial, we must assume that Appellants would have moved to strike this juror for cause and that the court would have granted the motion. We further must assume that Appellants would have exercised the peremptory they used for Juror No. 40 on another juror and that this other juror's replacement would have voted for an acquittal.</p>\n<p>Because of the highly speculative nature of these counterfactuals and in light of the very strong evidence against these Appellants, we cannot conclude with any reasonable probability that the district judge's omission regarding Juror No. 40, along with the error the district judge made with respect to Juror No. 2, necessarily affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. We do not, for example, have any basis in the record to conclude that the ex parte communications and what followed from them violated Appellants' Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury or that any change in the jury composition whether or not it was impartialwould have affected the outcome of the district court's proceedings. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. González-Meléndez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1379893\"><a href=\"/opinion/1379893/united-states-v-gonzalez-melendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 34 (1st <span class=\"star-pagination\">*605</span> Cir.2010)(\"[T]here is no basis in the record for concluding that the alteration in jury composition had an injurious influence on the verdict.\").</p>\n<p>Because Appellants cannot satisfy the third prong of the plain error test as articulated by the Supreme Court in <i>Marcus,</i> they fail to satisfy the plain error test itself. We thus need not reach the fourth prong, concerning whether \"the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Marcus,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2164.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Arzola-Martínez's Allocution</h2>\n<p>We next address a claim concerning Arzola-Martínez's right to allocute during sentencing. Arzola-Martínez argues that the district court committed reversible error during his sentencing hearing when it granted him the opportunity to address his objections only to the PSR, a constraint which Arzola-Martínez argues violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) in not permitting him a full, personal opportunity to speak or present information to mitigate his sentence. Arzola-Martínez thus requests that we remand his case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard/Scope of Review</h2>\n<p>We review <i>de novo</i> a sentencing court's compliance with procedural rules, including Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. <i>United States v.

Legal Framework</h2>\n<p>Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) provides that, before imposing a sentence, the court must \"address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence.\" Where the court does not afford a defendant this opportunity or its functional equivalent, \"the reviewing court must remand the case for resentencing, generally without needing to inquire into prejudice.\" <i>United States v.

Analysis</h2>\n<p>During the sentencing hearing that the district judge conducted with Arzola-Martínez on July 28, 2008, the court discussed Arzola-Martínez's PSR, with his counsel, Juan Pedrosa (\"Pedrosa\"). At the end of that discussion, during which Pedrosa raised several objections to the PSR, the court asked Pedrosa: \"So, counsel, any other statements that you would be submitting on behalf of your client?\" Pedrosa responded: \"No, Your Honor, just for allocution on his behalf.\"</p>\n<p>After Pedrosa allocuted on behalf of Arzola-Martínez, the district court stated that \"[Pedrosa] mentioned that [his] client wanted to address the court,\" and so asked Arzola-Martínez: \"Let me ask you if you have any objections, any other objections or any objections that you would like to discuss with the court, to the contents of the [PSR]?\" After taking issue with some portions of the PSR, Arzola-Martínez argued that he was not guilty as a co-conspirator in Las Avispas Dos. He denied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*606</span> knowing certain witnesses or having visited certain places crucial to his conviction. After hearing Arzola-Martínez's statement, the court asked: \"Any other statements[?]\" Arzola-Martínez's counsel responded: \"No [y]our Honor.\"</p>\n<p>From the record of he sentencing transcript, several aspects of Arzola-Martínez's hearing are clear. The district judge provided Pedrosa with the opportunity to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence of his client, Arzola-Martínez, which Pedrosa then did, asserting that he was doing so on his client's \"behalf.\" The district judge then addressed Arzola-Martínez personally in soliciting any objections to the PSR specifically, which Arzola-Martínez then provided and took the opportunity to broaden into more general comments about the facts alleged in the instant case. Afterwards, in the context of this conversation between the district judge and Arzola-Martínez, the district judge generally provided further opportunity to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence by soliciting \"[a]ny other statements,\" an invitation that Pedrosa answered in the negative on behalf of himself and his client. Although Pedrosa answered this question, it may well have been directed to Arzola-Martínez.</p>\n<p>We find that Arzola-Martínez was afforded the functional equivalent of the right to allocute during his sentencing hearing. That the trial court did not address its final question to Pedrosa by name or otherwise seem to address the question to any particular person supports the conclusion that the district court did not deny Arzola-Martínez his allocution opportunity. <i>See </i><i>Green v.

Accordingly, the district court committed no error concerning Arzola-Martínez's allocution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Rivera-Rodríguez's Sentencing Based on Drug Quantity Responsibility</h2>\n<p>Rivera-Rodríguez argues that his sentence was based on an unreliable calculation of the quantity of drugs attributable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*607</span> to him. Specifically, he contends, the district court committed clear error in determining that the average weight of each crack capsule at the Borinquen Ward drug point was 0.075 grams, as this calculation was unsubstantiated by the evidence presented at trial. The district court, Rivera-Rodríguez argues, thus erroneously found him responsible for a total of more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine.<sup>[12]</sup> Rivera-Rodríguez requests that we remand this issue to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1.

We have found that, to determine drug quantity, a district court</p>\n<blockquote>looks to all acts that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction, and takes into account not only what the defendant knew, but what conduct he reasonably foresaw.... Thus, each co-conspirator is responsible not only for the drugs he actually handled but also for the full amount of drugs that he could reasonably have anticipated would be within the ambit of the conspiracy. The trial court's determination of drug quantity need only be by a preponderance of the evidence and is not required to be an exact determination but rather only a reasoned estimate. Further, if the trial court bases its estimate on one of two plausible views, the determination is not clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Feliciano Rodríguez,</i> 525 F.3d at 107 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). We also review for clear error challenges to factual findings made at sentencing. <i>United States v. Shinderman,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Factual Findings</h2>\n<p>José A. Mercado-Negrón (\"Mercado-Negrón\"), a chemist who had worked twenty-six years for the Puerto Rico Forensic Science Institute, where he analyzed controlled substances, including crack cocaine, testified at trial. He stated that he had analyzed controlled substances in \"thousands of cases\" and had testified as an expert witness in federal court approximately five to six times and in state court hundreds of times. Mercado-Negrón further stated that, based on his experience analyzing crack cocaine seized in the area of Guayama, the average weight of a capsule of such crack cocaine was approximately 0.075 grams. Based on his testimony, the district court concluded that, in a given year, Las Avispas Dos could distribute 27 kilograms of crack cocaine and, through the life of the conspiracy, 109 kilograms of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Analysis</h2>\n<p>Rivera-Rodríguez makes much ado about the fact that Mercado-Negrón did not personally weigh the capsules of crack cocaine distributed by Las Avispas Dos and instead relied on his experience to provide his estimate of 0.075 grams per capsule. As Rivera-Rodríguez points out, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*608</span> at trial, the only exhibit upon which Mercado-Negrón relied was of powder cocaine, not crack cocaine. That exhibit contained two bags of powder cocaine totaling 0.080 grams that Rivera-Rodríguez sold to Luis A. Sepúlveda-Rivera (\"Officer Sepúlveda-Rivera\"), a member of the PRPD, in July 2006 while Officer Sepúlveda-Rivera was working undercover. Furthermore, Rivera-Rodríguez points to testimony of Rivera-Díaz in which Rivera-Díaz stated that he did not weigh the amounts of crack cocaine he placed into vials to be sold because he did not have the proper equipment to do so and because he did not pay attention to exactly what amount of crack cocaine he would measure and then deposit into the vials.</p>\n<p>We find that the district court did not clearly err in relying on Mercado-Negrón's figure of 0.075 grams of crack cocaine per capsule even though Mercado-Negrón did not personally weigh the capsules of crack cocaine at issue in this case. \"The court's finding as to drug quantity was not a mere hunch or intuition, but was a reasoned estimate based on reliable evidence in the record.\" <i>Correa-Alicea,</i> 585 F.3d at 490 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The district court's reasoned estimate here was based on Mercado-Negrón's extensive experience as a forensic chemist specializing in controlled substances, including crack cocaine, for which he was admitted to testify at trial as an expert, and he had previously analyzed crack cocaine seized from the location in which Las Avispas Dos operated. Rivera-Rodríguez also presented no developed argument about an alternative weight on which the district court could rely to formulate its calculations for sentencing. It was thus in the district court's discretion to rely on Mercado-Negrón's testimony in assessing the drug quantity for which Rivera-Rodríguez was responsible. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Arzola-Martínez's and Pabón-Mandrell's Sentencing Based on Prior Criminal History</h2>\n<p>Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell argue that the district court, in calculating their sentences, erroneously used their prior criminal histories. Arzola-Martínez contends that the district court improperly used his prior simple possession deferrals, which he argues never became final convictions, to apply the three strikes mandatory life imprisonment provisions of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A), 851, and 860. Pabón-Mandrell contends that the district court improperly utilized his two simple possession narcotics convictions, the underlying conduct of which was specifically included as an overt act of Count One, to apply the three strikes mandatory life imprisonment provisions of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A), 851, and 860. Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell thus request that we set aside their sentences and remand their cases to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p>The government responds that Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell's sentences should be affirmed because their prior felonies were sufficient under 21 U.S.C. § 851. As discussed below, we agree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1.

To trigger \"a mandatory term of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*609</span> life imprisonment without release,\" 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) requires that the defendant have \"two or more prior convictions for a felony drug offense\" and that those prior convictions \"have become final.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Analysis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Arzola-Martínez's Sentencing</h2>\n<p>To support its determination that Arzola-Martínez was subject to a life sentence under the provisions of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), the district court cited three instances in 2000 in which Arzola-Martínez was found in possession of marijuana and/or crack cocaine. These arrests and related charges were processed by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The cases were consolidated and, in 2001, upon Arzola-Martínez's guilty plea to the charges, the Puerto Rico Superior Court (\"PRSC\") placed Arzola-Martínez on probation for a term of eighteen months under a rehabilitation program. Pursuant to a favorable 2002 report by the coordinator of Arzola-Martínez's rehabilitation program, the PRSC expunged what the PSR termed the \"conviction\" resulting from these incidents.</p>\n<p>Arzola-Martínez argues that, contrary to the requirements of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), none of these instances, which Arzola-Martínez characterizes as \"simple drug possession cases,\" qualify as a \"prior conviction[]\" that has \"become final.\" Arzola-Martínez bases this contention on his argument that, \"since no conviction nor finding of guilt was ever entered[,] no appeal could have been taken.\" To support this conclusion, Arzola-Martínez notes that he entered the rehabilitation program and the PRSC expunged the record of these two cases. He further observes that Puerto Rico Rule of Criminal Procedure 247.1 provides that the rehabilitation program be \"implemented without a finding of guilt\" and \"shall not be deemed as a conviction.\"</p>\n<p>Arzola-Martínez's arguments are unavailing. The Supreme Court and our circuit indicate that federal law and not, as Arzola-Martínez argues, Puerto Rico Rule of Criminal Procedure 247.1 determines whether these instances constitute prior convictions under 21 U.S.C. § 851. <i>Cf. </i><i>Dickerson v. New Banner Inst., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110876\"><a href=\"/opinion/110876/dickerson-v-new-banner-institute-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 111-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110876\"><a href=\"/opinion/110876/dickerson-v-new-banner-institute-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">845</span></a></span> (1983) (\"Whether one has been `convicted' within the language of the gun control statutes is necessarily ... a question of federal, not state, law, despite the fact that the predicate offense and its punishment are defined by the law of the State. This makes for desirable national uniformity unaffected by varying state laws, procedures, and definitions of `conviction.'\" (internal citations omitted)); <i>United States v. Bustamante,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"417769\"><a href=\"/opinion/417769/united-states-v-oscar-d-bustamante/\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1983) (describing the holding in <i>Dickerson</i>). Although <i>Dickerson</i> and <i>Bustamante</i> related to the federal gun control statute, we see no justification why their underlying reasoning should not be applied, as here, to felony drug offenses. Indeed, we have already cited the principles for which <i>Dickerson</i> and <i>Bustamante</i> stand in adjudicating other cases involving felony drug offenses. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cuevas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196562\"><a href=\"/opinion/196562/united-states-v-cuevas/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span>, 782 (1st Cir.1996)(\"The decisions in <i>Dickerson</i> and <i>Bustamante</i> still stand for the proposition that, absent legislative indication to the contrary, the meaning of `conviction' for purposes of a federal statutory scheme is to be determined under prevailing federal law.\"). Consequently, we find that the district court properly considered Arzola-Martínez's prior criminal history based on federalnot state law.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we find that these incidents do constitute \"convictions\" for the purposes of 21 U.S.C. § 851. We agree with our sister courts of appeals that,</p>\n<blockquote>[f]or purposes of sentences imposed under § 841, ... Congress has not exempted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*610</span> from the \"prior convictions\" that must be counted those convictions removed from a criminal record for policy reasons unrelated to innocence or an error of law. The courts of appeals that have considered this § 841 question therefore have counted prior felony drug convictions even where those convictions had been set aside, expunged, or otherwise removed from a defendant's record for such reasons.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Law,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187186\"><a href=\"/opinion/187186/united-states-v-law/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span>, 911 (D.C.Cir.2008)(citing cases from the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits). We thus find that Arzola-Martínez's prior offenses qualify as \"convictions\" pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Pabón-Mandrell's Sentencing</h2>\n<p>On March 30, 2005, Pabón-Mandrell was arrested for illegally possessing, with the intent to distribute, cocaine (\"the 2005 incident\"). His conviction became final on June 20, 2006, when he was sentenced to probation. Pabón-Mandrell argues that, when the government chose to include the 2005 incident as part of Count One,<sup>[13]</sup> the government \"waived the right to claim the local conviction arising out of said incident as a predicate `prior' conviction for purposes of qualifying [Pabón-Mandrell] as a third strike offender.\" Pabón-Mandrell bases this argument on our holding in <i>United States v. De</i><i> Jesús Mateo</i> that \"[p]rior felony drug convictions will be counted separately for purposes of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) <i>only when</i> they represent distinct criminal episodes,\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201077\"><a href=\"/opinion/201077/united-states-v-de-jesus-mateo/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2004)(emphasis added) (citation omitted), and that the March 2005 incident was not a \"distinct criminal episode[]\" from the charged offense in Count One. Regardless, the district court did include the 2005 incident in making its determination that the three strikes mandatory life term applied to Pabón-Mandrell.</p>\n<p>The same case Pabón-Mandrell cites settles this matter. In <i>De Jesús Mateo,</i> we held that our circuit's precedent forecloses the argument that prior convictions do not represent \"distinct criminal episodes\" when they are part and parcel of a defendant's participation in a drug trafficking conspiracy. 373 F.3d at 74 (holding that prior convictions for separate drug transactions that were eleven months apart constituted separate criminal episodes even though the conduct underlying both convictions was arguably part of the same conspiracy). Our reasoning in <i>De Jesús Mateo</i> relied on an earlier ruling, in <i>United States v. Martínez-Medina,</i> in which we quoted a Ninth Circuit opinion stating that</p>\n<blockquote>[a]n ongoing course of criminal conduct such as narcotics trafficking may involve many such criminal episodes, each a discrete occurrence. The fact that all are related, part of a series, or part of a continuous course of criminal dealing, does not necessarily render them a \"single\" criminal episode, particularly where the episodes occur over time. To so hold would insulate the very career criminals the statute is designed to reachthose continuously engaged in criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776396\"><a href=\"/opinion/776396/united-states-v-marcos-martinez-medina-united-states-of-america-v-manuel/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 123 (1st Cir.2002)(quoting <i>United States v. Maxey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602894\"><a href=\"/opinion/602894/united-states-v-joe-sherman-maxey/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, 307 (9th Cir.1993)(holding that the district court properly imposed a life sentence under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) because the defendant's prior convictions, although part of one drug trafficking conspiracy, stemmed from several transactions occurring several months apart)). We also have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*611</span> previously held that \"[a] prior drug conviction constitutes a `distinct criminal episode' sufficient to trigger the enhancement so long as the defendant continued to participate in drug activity after the conviction became final.\" <i>Lino,</i> 493 F.3d at 43.</p>\n<p>The 2005 incident, despite being part of the drug conspiracy of which Pabón-Mandrell was charged in the instant case, constitutes a \"distinct criminal episode[]\" because Pabón-Mandrell continued to participate in drug activity after that conviction became final. Rivera-Díaz and Brito-Pacheco testified at trial that Pabón-Mandrell was the \"runner\" of heroin for Las Avispas Dos. Irving Ofray-Vázquez (\"Agent Ofray-Vázquez\"), an FBI agent, testified during Pabón-Mandrell's sentencing hearing that Pabón-Mandrell participated in the drug conspiracy charged in the instant case even after he was convicted for the 2005 incident and put on probation in June 2006. Specifically, Agent Ofray-Vázquez testified that, as late as December 2006, Pabón-Mandrell was still a leader of Las Avispas Dos at the La Pluma drug point. As evidence to support this conclusion, Agent Ofray-Vázquez cited the statement of a cooperating witness who reported that, in almost all cases, either Pabón-Mandrell or another man would pick up money from or take drugs to be sold at La Pluma. Agent Ofray-Vázquez also stated that further testimony provided to him by informants, including Rivera-Díaz, indicated that Pabón-Mandrell had a \"big role\" in Las Avispas Dos from its inception in 2003 until law enforcement ceased its operations in 2007. Agent Ofray-Vázquez also testified that, even after June 2006, while he was conducting surveillance on the areas, Agent Ofray-Vázquez \"always\" saw Pabón-Mandrell at both the La Pluma and Las Vías drug points.</p>\n<p>The mere fact that Pabón-Mandrell's conduct during the March 2005 incident was cited in the list of overt acts in the instant case's indictment does not mean the government waived its assertion that the associated conviction was a prior conviction for purposes of qualifying Pabón-Mandrell as a third strike offender. Although there is no indication that the conduct leading to the prior convictions at issue in <i>De Jesús Mateo</i> was listed in that case's indictment, the distinction does not compel a different outcome here. In <i>De Jesús Mateo,</i> we explicitly noted the failure of the defendant's attempt to distinguish his case from <i>Martínez-Medina</i> on the basis that, in <i>De Jesús Mateo,</i> \"the government presented evidence of marijuana trafficking ... which was the same conduct underlying De Jes[ú]s's prior marijuana conviction.\" 373 F.3d at 75 n. 3. We observed that</p>\n<blockquote>[t]he dispositive point here is not that evidence of De Jes[ú]s distributing marijuana was presented at his conspiracy trial but rather that his prior cocaine conviction was a separate criminal episode from his prior marijuana conviction even though the conduct underlying both convictions was arguably part of the same conspiracy. As for any claim that the conspiracy comprised the same episode as either of the two prior convictions, the short answer is that the conviction in this case was for conspiring to distribute heroin and cocaine, an episode continuing well beyond either of the prior convictions for discrete episodes of possession and distribution.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> Similarly, the dispositive point here is not that an allegation of Pabón-Mandrell possessing, with the intent to distribute, cocaine was included as an overt act in the indictment in the instant case but rather that his prior cocaine conviction was a separate criminal episode from his conspiracy conviction even though the conduct underlying both convictions was arguably part of the same conspiracy. Pabón-Mandrell's conviction in the instant case <span class=\"star-pagination\">*612</span> was for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute and actual distribution of narcotics, an episode continuing well beyond his prior conviction for a discrete episode of possessing, with the intent to distribute, cocaine.</p>\n<p>Both Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell also argue that at least one of the prior convictions that the district court counted in sentencing each of them to the three strikes life terms should not, in fact, count because the law's \"absurd result\" of punishing \"cases of simple possession involving small amounts of drugs\" is \"counter to Congressional intent\" to punish \"dangerous narcotics traffickers.\" While acknowledging that the \"literal application of the language utilized in the statute may appear to foreclose any further analysis concerning its proper application\" here, to support their contentions, these two Appellants nonetheless cite the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Green v. Bock Laundry Mach. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112264\"><a href=\"/opinion/112264/green-v-bock-laundry-machine-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 510-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112264\"><a href=\"/opinion/112264/green-v-bock-laundry-machine-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span> (1989), in which the Court held that a statute's literal interpretation can be ignored if it \"can't mean what it says\" (citation omitted). <i>See also id.,</i> 490 U.S. at 527, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112264\"><a href=\"/opinion/112264/green-v-bock-laundry-machine-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1981</span></a></span> (Scalia, J., concurring)(suggesting that the literal interpretation of a statute can be ignored if it \"produces an absurd, and perhaps unconstitutional, result\"). However, besides punishing serious drug offenders, we have observed that an additional purpose of such a sentencing enhancement is to punish recidivism. <i>See </i><i>Lino,</i> 493 F.3d at 43. Such recidivism is a concern with both of these Appellants, given that their prior convictions and the instant case all relate to drug offenses. \"Indeed, if the rule advocated by [Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell] were adopted, we would insulate the very career criminals the [enhancement] is designed to reachthose continuously engaged in criminal conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 43-44 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in the original). As such, imposing the three strikes life term on Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell for these repeat offenses is neither absurd nor a violation of Congressional intent.</p>\n<p>In sum, we find that the district court did not err in counting the aforementioned instances as \"prior convictions\" that led the district court to impose the three strikes life term on the felony drug offense repeat offenders Arzola-Martínez and Pabón-Mandrell.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We conclude that there was sufficient evidence adduced at trial for the jury to convict Arzola-Martínez, Muñiz-Massa, and Rivera-Moreno. We further conclude that the ex parte conversations that the district judge held with prospective jurors were not plain error. Moreover, the district court did not err with respect to the various sentencing claims made by Arzola-Martínez, Rivera-Rodríguez, and Pabón-Mandrell. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Count Two, relating to forfeiture of property upon a conviction under Count One, 21 U.S.C. § 853(a)(1) and (2), was dismissed at each Appellant's sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p>[2]  In the companion cases of <i>United States v. Cintrón-Echautegui,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1675\"><a href=\"/opinion/1675/united-states-v-cintron-echautegui/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 2010), and <i>United States v. Rivera-Moreno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150927\"><a href=\"/opinion/150927/united-states-v-rivera-moreno/\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2010), two co-conspirators in Las Avispas Dos pled guilty to the conspiracy count, and we affirmed the district court's judgments in each case.</p>\n<p>[3]  Besides the issues discussed here, Arzola-Martínez, Pabón-Mandrell, and Rivera-Rodríguez raised, in their initial brief, another issue, concerning the number of peremptory challenges the district court granted to the prosecution at trial. These Appellants argued that the district court committed plain error when it granted the prosecution twelve peremptory challenges, which these Appellants argued violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(b)(2). These Appellants thus requested that we find that the district court committed plain error and grant them a new trial. In supplemental appellate briefing that we ordered both parties to submit after oral argument, the government noted that, during a supplemental conference with the district court on March 12, 2010, \"[t]he district court and the trial attorneys (both for the government and defense) clarified that although the record says '12' only six (6) peremptory challenges were given to the government with two challenges for the 3 alternates.\" Appellants conceded the point during that conference, and so we do not address this issue further.</p>\n<p>[4]  The record is not clear about the nature of these two arrests and convictions. We can only glean that they were related to weapons charges.</p>\n<p>[5]  The record is not clear about the nature of this arrest. Defense counsel stated that it was for larceny but noted that Rivera-Díaz said it was drug-related.</p>\n<p>[6]  Arzola-Martínez and Muñiz-Massa also attack the credibility of witnesses who testified at trial as a basis for finding that the evidence was insufficient for a jury to find them guilty. However, \"[w]e do not assess the credibility of a witness, as that is a role reserved for the jury.\" <i>United States v. Troy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204022\"><a href=\"/opinion/204022/united-states-v-troy/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We thus need not consider this matter.</p>\n<p>[7]  Rivera-Díaz testified that a runner \"is in charge of keeping the material in his house to then bring it over to the drug point and hand it over to the seller, and then to collect the monies and keep it for the owner of the material.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  An inconsistency exists in the record with respect to Juror No. 40. At one point during voir dire on February 11, 2008, Juror No. 40 is recorded as referring to \"my wife,\" whereas at another point on the same day the juror is recorded as referring to \"[m]y husband.\" Furthermore, despite the jury list indicating a female name for Juror No. 40, the district judge, during the supplemental hearing, referred to the prospective juror using the masculine pronoun and mentioned the juror's \"wife.\" The gender of the juror and the juror's spouse are irrelevant to our inquiry, so we need not resolve these matters.</p>\n<p>[9]  We derive the total number of prospective jurors from the district judge's list provided in Appellants' supplemental brief.</p>\n<p>[10]  In the cases of Juror Nos. 2 and 35, the trial transcript does not explicitly state that the conversations occurred \"[a]t the bench,\" as the trial transcripts of the other ex parte communications do.\n</p>\n<p>In the case of Juror No. 2, the district judge summarized the conversation when she summarized the ex parte communications she conducted with other prospective jurors, suggesting that the judge's communication with this juror was also ex parte. During the supplemental hearing, the district judge resolved this matter by acknowledging that the prospective juror \"was examined at the bench.\"</p>\n<p>In the case of Juror No. 35, the trial transcript reflects that that prospective juror stated his number and then that the district judge summarized what the prospective juror said. This portion of the transcript thus suggests that the district judge did conduct an unrecorded ex parte communication with this prospective juror.</p>\n<p>Given that (1) the district judge summarized the conversations she had with both Juror Nos. 2 and 35, as she did with the other thirteen prospective jurors with whom she conducted ex parte communications, (2) Appellants claim and the government does not refute that Juror Nos. 2 and 35 were subject to ex parte communications, and (3) the district judge concedes that at least the communication with Juror No. 2 was ex parte, we assume that both of these jurors were indeed among the prospective jurors questioned by the district judge outside the presence of counsel.</p>\n<p>[11]  In the case of Juror No. 60, the trial transcript omits what the prospective juror said, noting only that it was in Spanish. The trial transcript does, however, reflect what the district judge stated. Because the transcript of the district judge's statement is within the portion of the transcript noted as being \"[a]t the bench,\" and not \"[i]n open court,\" that suggests that, contrary to Appellants' claim, the court reporter was present and did transcribe the district judge's statement, but omitted the prospective juror's statement. The Spanish answers of Juror No. 60 could have been translated by the court reporter if proper procedure had been followed.</p>\n<p>[12]  Rivera-Rodríguez does not challenge the mathematical formula and hypotheticals that the district court employed to conclude that if a vial of crack cocaine weighed 0.075 grams, Rivera-Rodríguez would be responsible for a total of more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. We thus focus only on Rivera-Rodríguez's challenge to the average weight of each vial.</p>\n<p>[13]  The indictment's section on \"Overt Acts in Furtherance of the Conspiracy\" includes the following: \"On or about March 30, 2005, [Pabón-Mandrell] possessed a measurable amount of cocaine and marihuana, in or around the area of a `drug distribution point', located in Borinquen Ward, Guayama, PR.\"</p>\n\n</div>",
