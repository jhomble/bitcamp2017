José Julian Cruz-Berríos, an\n\ninmate currently serving a sentence under the jurisdiction of the\n\nPuerto Rico Department of Corrections, brought a federal civil\n\nrights action against various corrections officers whom he alleges\n\nexerted excessive force against him.    The district court dismissed\n\nthe action after determining that it was precluded as res judicata\n\nby his previous, unsuccessful state suit based on similar alleged\n\nconduct.1   Cruz-Berríos v. Gonzalez-Rosario, 577 F. Supp. 2d 561\n\n(D.P.R. 2008).   Cruz-Berríos now appeals.   After review, we affirm\n\nin part, reverse in part, and remand the case to the district court\n\nfor further development of the record and clarification on matters\n\nof Puerto Rico law.\n\n\n\n                                  I.\n\n            In March 2004, Cruz-Berríos filed a lawsuit in the Puerto\n\nRico Court of First Instance under Article 1802 of the P.R. Civil\n\nCode, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31 § 5141, alleging that officers in the\n\nPuerto Rico correctional facility where he was housed had assaulted\n\nhim in retaliation for implicating them in a drug trafficking\n\ninvestigation. His complaint referred to two separate incidents of\n\nabuse, one on November 9, 2002, and another on February 28, 2004.\n\n\n     1\n      Puerto Rico is the functional equivalent of a state for all\npurposes relevant to this case.    Accordingly, we refer here to\nstate actions and state courts, notwithstanding Puerto Rico's\nunique commonwealth status. See, e.g., R.G. Fin. Corp. v. Vergara-\nNunez, 446 F.3d 178, 183 n.2 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                 -2-\n\f                Shortly after initiating that action, Cruz-Berríos also\n\nfiled a complaint in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\nmaking similar allegations.                  Some, though not all, of the named\n\ndefendants in the federal complaint were also defendants in the\n\nstate        court    case.       Cruz-Berríos      twice   amended     the   federal\n\ncomplaint, each time adding a new incident that he claimed had\n\noccurred after the most recent filing.2                     In the first amended\n\ncomplaint,           he   added     additional      corrections        officers    and\n\nadministrators as defendants and included a third assault that had\n\nallegedly occurred on August 18, 2004, which he claimed was part of\n\nthe   same      general       pattern   of    retaliation   as   the    original   two\n\nincidents.           In the second amended complaint, he alleged a fourth\n\nsuch incident, which he claimed occurred on March 2, 2005, and\n\nadded another prison administrator as a defendant.3                    Of these four\n\nalleged incidents, only the claims concerning the last three were\n\npermitted to proceed, as the district court determined that the\n\nclaim arising out of the November 2002 incident was time-barred.4\n\n                Due to developments in the state court case, however,\n\nthose three claims did not proceed very far.                 After a bench trial,\n\n\n        2\n            At no point did Cruz-Berríos amend his state complaint.\n      3\n      In order to avoid a sovereign immunity bar, he also specified\nthat any claims for damages were against the defendants in their\npersonal capacities, while any injunctive relief sought was against\nthe defendants in both their personal and official capacities. See\nEdelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 664–65 (1974).\n        4\n            Cruz-Berríos does not challenge this conclusion on appeal.\n\n                                              -3-\n\fthe Court of First Instance entered judgment against Cruz-Berríos,\n\nfinding that no excessive use of force had been used on either of\n\nthe dates discussed in the state complaint (November 2002 and\n\nFebruary 2004) and that he had failed to show that he had been\n\nsingled out for retaliatory persecution or harassment.         That\n\nadverse judgment, the federal district court later held, precluded\n\nthe § 1983 action in its entirety, including the allegations\n\nagainst the additional defendants concerning incidents that had not\n\npreviously been the subject of litigation.     The district court\n\ndismissed the case, and this appeal ensued.\n\n\n\n                                II.\n\n          The defendants ask us to affirm on two separate bases.\n\nThey primarily argue that we may rely on the district court's\n\npreclusion rationale, which is subject to de novo review.   Ramallo\n\nBros. Printing, Inc. v. El Dia, Inc., 490 F.3d 86, 89 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).   Offering an alternative means to the same end, they also\n\nassert that Cruz-Berríos failed to exhaust his administrative\n\nremedies before filing his federal claim, in violation of 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1997e(a).   Because the second of these arguments may provide an\n\nuncomplicated means of resolving this case on a more developed\n\nrecord, we begin there.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f                                   A.\n\n           The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PLRA\"), 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1997e(a), provides that \"[n]o action shall be brought with\n\nrespect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or\n\nany other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison,\n\nor other correctional facility until such administrative remedies\n\nas are available are exhausted.\"           This exhaustion requirement\n\napplies to allegations of physical violence by prison guards.\n\nPorter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 532 (2002).\n\n           The defendants contend that dismissal is warranted here\n\nbecause the complaint fails to indicate whether or not Cruz-Berríos\n\nhas exhausted his administrative remedies.        But it was not Cruz-\n\nBerríos's burden to plead exhaustion, which must be raised and\n\nproved by the defense.      Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 216 (2007).\n\nAlthough the defendants have now raised the issue, neither they nor\n\nCruz-Berríos have pointed to any evidence in the record that would\n\nindicate one way or the other whether the exhaustion requirement\n\nhas in fact been satisfied.            And because the district court\n\ndismissed the case on preclusion grounds, it never addressed the\n\nmatter.   Accordingly, we remand the case to the district court for\n\nadditional   fact-finding    as   to    whether   the   PLRA   exhaustion\n\nrequirement bars Cruz-Berríos's suit or not.            If so, it would\n\nobviate any further need to consider the preclusive effect of the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fCourt of First Instance's decision.           But this is the defendants'\n\nburden to prove.\n\n\n\n                                    B.\n\n          A   final    judgment     on    a    matter   may,   in   certain\n\ncircumstances,     prevent   that   matter's      re-adjudication    in   a\n\nsubsequent case. The doctrine of res judicata5 \"relieve[s] parties\n\nof the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve[s] judicial\n\nresources, and, by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage[s]\n\nreliance on adjudication.\"        Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94\n\n(1980).   Because \"[u]nder the full faith and credit statute, 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1738, a judgment rendered in a state court is entitled to\n\nthe same preclusive effect in federal court as it would be given\n\nwithin the state in which it was rendered,\" In re Sonus Networks,\n\nInc., 499 F.3d 47, 56 (1st Cir. 2007), we look to Puerto Rico law\n\nin order to determine the res judicata implications of the Court of\n\nFirst Instance's judgment.\n\n          Puerto Rico's law of res judicata is codified at P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 31, § 3343, which provides that a prior judgment\n\n\n     5\n      Depending on the speaker's intention, the term \"res judicata\"\nmay refer either to the doctrine of claim preclusion specifically\n(coupled with \"collateral estoppel\" as a synonym for issue\npreclusion) or else to the doctrines of claim and issue preclusion\ncollectively. We here use the phrase in the second sense. See\nTaylor v. Sturgell, 128 S. Ct. 2161, 2170 n.5 (2008) (explaining\nthat the broad meaning of res judicata as an umbrella term that\nencompasses both claim preclusion and issue preclusion \"ha[s]\nreplaced a more confusing lexicon\").\n\n                                    -6-\n\fwill       have    preclusive       effect    when    there     is    \"the    most      perfect\n\nidentity between the things, causes, and persons of the litigants,\n\nand their capacity as such.\"                  This provision encompasses both of\n\nthe two traditional aspects of res judicata:                         claim preclusion and\n\nissue preclusion.               Coors Brewing Co. v. Mendez-Torres, 562 F.3d 3,\n\n19 (1st Cir. 2009). Under Puerto Rico's res judicata scheme, claim\n\npreclusion \"binds parties from litigating or relitigating any claim\n\nthat was or could have been litigated in a prior adjudication and\n\nprevents claim splitting,\" Gener-Villar v. Adcom Group, Inc., 417\n\nF.3d 201, 205 (1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (internal brackets\n\nomitted);          issue    preclusion,       on     the    other     hand,       \"forecloses\n\nrelitigation         in    a     subsequent    action      of   a    fact    essential     for\n\nrendering a judgment in a prior action between the same parties,\n\neven when different causes of action are involved.\" Id. at 205–06.\n\n                  The three claims presented to us on appeal, corresponding\n\nto the final three alleged incidents of abuse, fall into two\n\ncategories.6             The February 2004 incident has already been the\n\nsubject of actual litigation in the Court of First Instance.                               The\n\nAugust 2004 and March 2005 incidents, on the other hand, have not.\n\nThe district court concluded that this distinction was irrelevant\n\nand that all three claims were subject to issue preclusion. Citing\n\nthe    rule       that     \"a    plaintiff    cannot       avoid     the    bar    of   [issue\n\n\n       6\n      Cruz-Berríos claimed four separate incidents of abuse in his\nsecond amended complaint, but because the first of these claims was\ntime-barred, our review extends only to the final three.\n\n                                              -7-\n\fpreclusion] simply by suing a defendant for continuing the same\n\nconduct that was found to be lawful in a previous suit brought by\n\nthe same plaintiff,\"7       Ramallo Bros. Printing, Inc., 490 F.3d at\n\n91, the court held that no material differences existed between any\n\nof the alleged incidents of abuse because the plaintiff presented\n\nthem as part of a \"continuing pattern of violation.\" Cruz-Berríos,\n\n577 F. Supp. 2d at 564 (emphasis in original).           As a result, to the\n\nextent that the first set of incidents was found to be lawful in\n\nthe state case, the second set of incidents would also be lawful as\n\na matter of issue preclusion.\n\n           We disagree.        The distinction between the claims already\n\nadjudicated and those not already adjudicated remains critical\n\nhere.    It     is   therefore    necessary    to   unravel   the   individual\n\nallegations that the district court viewed as part of a single\n\nwhole.\n\n\n\n                                       1.\n\n           To begin with, issue preclusion does not apply to the\n\nevents   that    the   Court    of   First   Instance   never   expressly   or\n\nimplicitly considered.          The alleged August 2004 and March 2005\n\n\n     7\n      Cruz-Berríos correctly observes that this principle is taken\nfrom a case concerning federal, rather than Puerto Rico, issue\npreclusion principles. He does not, however, offer any authority\none way or the other as to whether Puerto Rico law encompasses an\nanalogous rule. Because we ultimately conclude that the principle\nis inapposite to this situation anyway, we will assume without\ndeciding that Puerto Rico law mirrors federal law on this point.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fbeatings, which appeared for the first time in the federal case,\n\nare independent events that are far too fact-specific to lend\n\nthemselves to generalization as \"the same conduct\" examined in the\n\nstate case.       That the Court of First Instance held Cruz-Berríos's\n\ntreatment in prison to be lawful on certain occasions does not\n\nnecessarily dictate as a matter of issue preclusion that his\n\ntreatment on subsequent occasions must be held lawful as well. Cf.\n\nDawkins v. Nabisco, Inc., 549 F.2d 396, 397 (5th Cir. 1977)\n\n(holding under federal res judicata principles that a dismissal of\n\na   Title   VII    retaliation   claim   could      not    preclude     claims    of\n\nsubsequent retaliation because otherwise \"a company that had once\n\nwon a suit alleging retaliation for participation in Title VII\n\nproceedings would be free to retaliate at will against the earlier\n\nplaintiff     without    fear    of   being    held       accountable    for     its\n\nactions.\"). At this juncture, it is impossible to tell whether the\n\nconduct newly alleged in the federal case would turn out to be\n\nmeaningfully different from the conduct tried on the merits in the\n\nstate   case.       Further   proceedings     may   establish    that     the    new\n\nallegations are simply more of the same, or they may turn out to be\n\nsomething more egregious.\n\n            The defendants argue that insofar as Cruz-Berríos has\n\nchosen to present the individual incidents as part of a continuing\n\npattern of abuse, the issue posed by the new claims is actually\n\nidentical to the one already adjudicated in state court.                         The\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fresponse is that this is not necessarily so.                      It discounts the fact\n\nthat there are two more alleged incidents of beatings later.                                It\n\nalso discounts the possibility that Cruz-Berrios's rights were\n\nviolated in at least one instance, creating potential liability for\n\nat least some defendants regardless of whether there is a pattern.\n\n                  At the same time, even if issue preclusion does not\n\napply       to    these        newly    alleged       incidents,      claim       preclusion\n\nnevertheless might apply.                 The district court indicated that Cruz-\n\nBerríos should have amended his state complaint to reflect these\n\ntwo new incidents, which arose before his state case went to\n\ntrial.8      Cruz-Berríos, 577 F. Supp. 2d at 564.                    The court did not\n\nindicate         the   source      of   this    rule,    and    while    the      defendants\n\nunderstandably defend it on appeal, they similarly provide no\n\nauthority for it.            It is true that some jurisdictions employ a rule\n\nthat a party is obligated, on pain of preclusion, to amend a\n\ncomplaint to reflect events that postdate the commencement of the\n\naction.      See, e.g., Monterey Plaza Hotel Ltd. P'ship. v. Local 483\n\nof Hotel Employees, 215 F.3d 923, 928 (9th Cir. 2000) (applying\n\nCalifornia         law      that   \"the     doctrine    of     res   judicata      bars    the\n\nrelitigation           of   all    events    which     occurred      prior   to    entry    of\n\njudgment,        and     not    just    those    acts    that     happened     before      the\n\n\n\n        8\n      Although the district court portrayed this as a matter of\nissue preclusion, we think it is actually one of claim preclusion,\nwhich, unlike issue preclusion, can bar a matter that has not yet\nbeen actually litigated.\n\n                                               -10-\n\fcomplaint was filed.\"). But other jurisdictions do not impose such\n\na burden on plaintiffs, see, e.g., Doe v. Allied-Signal, Inc., 985\n\nF.2d 908, 915 (7th Cir. 1993), and there is no reason to assume\n\nconclusorily what Puerto Rico's rule may be.    Because this issue\n\nhas not yet been briefed, we think it best to remand the case to\n\nthe district court, where the parties may have a chance to argue\n\nwhether Puerto Rico law would apply claim preclusion to post-\n\ncomplaint events that could have been but were not raised through\n\nan amended complaint.\n\n\n\n                                2.\n\n          We turn then to the preclusion of the federal claim\n\nconcerning the February 2004 incident, which the Court of First\n\nInstance did adjudicate on the merits.   Cruz-Berríos contends that\n\nthis claim was not precluded, notwithstanding the state court's\n\nadjudication of the same facts, because the res judicata statute's\n\nrequirements of \"perfect identity between the things, causes, and\n\npersons of the litigants\" have not been met.   For the most part at\n\nleast, he is mistaken.    As we shall explain, an underdeveloped\n\nrecord prevents us from making a less qualified statement.\n\n\n\n                                i.\n\n          Cruz-Berríos sued all of the federal action defendants in\n\nboth their official and personal capacities.    We can immediately\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fresolve the official-capacity claim.              Cruz-Berríos first posits\n\nthat the parties are not identical inasmuch as his federal action\n\ncontains   new     defendants.        Yet   the   Puerto     Rico    res   judicata\n\nstatute's \"perfect identity of parties\" clause does not demand a\n\nliteral identity; it operates, rather, as a privity requirement.\n\nR.G. Fin. Corp. v. Vergara-Nunez, 446 F.3d 178, 185–86 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Perez-Guzman v. Gracia, 346 F.3d 229, 234 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nThis means that the clause is satisfied whenever \"one party acts\n\nfor or stands in the place of another in relation to a particular\n\nsubject matter,\" R.G. Fin. Corp., 446 F.3d at 187, or, in the\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court's words, whenever those parties amount to\n\nthe same \"party really interested.\"               Puerto Rican Independence\n\nParty v. Commonwealth Elections Comm'n, 20 P.R. Offic. Trans. 607,\n\n632 (1988).\n\n            That    condition    is    satisfied     here.          Traditionally,\n\n\"[t]here is privity between officers of the same government so that\n\na judgment in a suit between a party and a representative of the\n\n[government] is res judicata in relitigation of the same issue\n\nbetween    that    party   and   another      officer   of    the     government.\"\n\nSunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U.S. 381, 402–03\n\n(1940); see also Barclay v. Lowe, 131 F. App'x 778, 779 (2d Cir.\n\n2005) (applying the privity principle to state corrections officers\n\nsued in their official capacities for allegedly assaulting an\n\ninmate).    As stated, Puerto Rico law treats such privity between\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fparties as identity.       With respect to the plaintiff's official-\n\ncapacity   claim   based   on   the    February    2004   allegations,   the\n\nrepresentative roles of the defendants in this action are the same\n\nas those in the state action. The parties in the official-capacity\n\nsuit are therefore perfectly identical to the parties in the prior\n\nlitigation.   See Del Carmen Tirado v. Dep't of Educ., 296 F. Supp.\n\n2d 127, 134 (D.P.R. 2003) (noting that official-capacity claims\n\nagainst officers in the Puerto Rico Department of Education were\n\nbarred by res judicata, notwithstanding those officers' nonparty\n\nstatus in a prior state suit).\n\n           Cruz-Berríos next avers that the \"things\" and \"causes\"\n\nare not identical because his federal claim arises under § 1983,\n\nwhile his state claim arose under a state tort statute.          As we have\n\ndiscussed elsewhere, this sort of argument \"mistakes the legal\n\ncause of action for the factual 'cause' contemplated by Puerto\n\nRico's preclusion statute:      preclusion requires an identity of the\n\nlatter, not the former.\" Baez-Cruz v. Municipality of Comerio, 140\n\nF.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir. 1998).     Thus, regardless of the legal vehicle\n\nthrough which an action is brought, claims share a perfect identity\n\nof cause \"when they flow from the same principal ground or origin.\"\n\nR.G. Fin. Corp., 446 F.3d at 183.            So long as the claims \"either\n\nwere or could have been asserted in a prior action\" based on the\n\nsame transaction, they are precludable.            Id.    Similarly, \"[t]wo\n\nactions share an identity of 'things' if a decision in the second\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\faction might function to contradict a right arisen or arising from,\n\nor a right affirmed by a prior decision.\"           Id.   (internal brackets\n\nand quotation marks omitted).        Accordingly, \"a mere difference in\n\nthe legal theories on which two causes of action are grounded does\n\nnot destroy the identity of thing or cause that otherwise exists\n\nbetween two suits arising out of a common nucleus of operative\n\nfact.\"    Id. at 184.    This all amounts to what is known in common\n\nlaw   jurisdictions     as   the   \"transactional     approach\"      to    claim\n\npreclusion.    Id. at 183.\n\n            Here,   Cruz-Berríos's    federal   claim     entails    the    same\n\nfactual cause as was dealt with in the analogous claim in his state\n\nsuit, namely, the officers' conduct on February 28, 2004; the\n\n§ 1983 theory of liability could have originally been raised in his\n\nstate suit, Acevedo v. Srio. Servicios Sociales, 12 P.R. Offic.\n\nTrans. 317 (1982); and a finding of liability in his federal suit\n\nwould    necessarily    contradict    the   Court    of   First     Instance's\n\ndetermination that the corrections officers acted lawfully.                  The\n\nthing and cause, like the identity of the parties, are identical.\n\nThus, Cruz-Berríos's state suit precludes his current official-\n\ncapacity claim against the defendants concerning the events in\n\nFebruary 2004.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f                                   ii.\n\n          Cruz-Berríos's personal-capacity claim, on the other\n\nhand, is not so neatly resolved.         Although the capacity in which\n\nthe defendants are sued does not affect the identities of thing and\n\ncause, there is some possibility that it would affect the identity\n\nof the parties.   At the outset, we note our skepticism that Puerto\n\nRico law would allow a plaintiff who lost against one defendant to\n\nthen bring a new claim against another defendant (to say nothing of\n\na claim against the same defendant merely in a different capacity)\n\nbased on the same transaction where the outcome in the first case\n\neffectively   negates   the    claim     in   the   second.     Were   such\n\nrelitigation permissible, a plaintiff could in principle have as\n\nmany bites of the apple as there were non-privy defendants to be\n\nsued.   This is precisely the sort of outcome that defensive non-\n\nmutual issue preclusion typically guards against.\n\n          At the same time, we are not in a position to convert\n\nthat instinctive skepticism into an authoritative statement that\n\nPuerto Rico law would dispense with its mutuality requirement under\n\nthese circumstances.    So far as we can glean, the case law does not\n\ndefinitively foreclose the possibility that Puerto Rico would\n\nrequire mutuality even under these circumstances.             We therefore\n\nproceed with caution, and will await further development of the\n\ncase, before making any definitive statement as to which result\n\nPuerto Rico law intends.      On remand, the parties and the district\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fcourt should devote some attention to this issue if it proves\n\nnecessary to resolve the case.\n\n           If the personal-capacity claims are indeed subject to\n\nnon-mutual issue preclusion, then the February 2004 claim would be\n\nbarred as to all defendants, and nothing more need be said.          If, on\n\nthe other hand, it turns out that a mutuality requirement does\n\nprevent   preclusion   against   such    newly   named   personal-capacity\n\ndefendants, we would need to take the further step of looking to\n\nsee who was named in the state suit.            It is clear that at least\n\nsome of the newly named defendants were included in the federal\n\ncomplaint solely because of the August 2004 and March 2005 claims.9\n\nSubject to our earlier discussion of post-complaint events, the\n\nCourt of First Instance's decision would not appear to preclude\n\nthose claims against those defendants.10\n\n           Thus, a strict mutuality requirement would necessitate a\n\ncomplete tally of who was named in the first suit.          Unfortunately,\n\nthe record before us contains none.          Its only reference to the\n\nparties   before   the   Court   of     First    Instance   occurs   in   a\n\n\n     9\n      So far as we can tell from our reading of the second amended\ncomplaint, these defendants are:     William Class-Quirós, Santos\nJiménez-Colón, Eddie M. Cruz-Santiago, Erick García-Santos, Enil\nMontalvo-Morales, Osvaldo Rivera-Domínguez, and Wilmer Sepúlveda.\n     10\n      This conclusion, which follows from Puerto Rico's \"identity\nof parties\" requirement, seems inconsistent with the extension of\nres judicata to post-complaint events, even those involving\nnonparties, as the district court appears to have assumed. But we\nleave it to the litigants and the district court on remand to\nconsider in the first instance what the actual state of the law is.\n\n                                  -16-\n\fnonexhaustive list appearing in a Puerto Rico appeals court's\n\nrecitation of facts in the underlying case.       Although the list\n\nmentions some defendants by name, it also adds the cryptic phrase\n\n\"and others.\"11   Because we cannot divine the identity of those\n\nothers, we can only speculate as to who may be shielded by res\n\njudicata and who may not.       At the very least, any individual\n\nclearly named as a personal-capacity defendant in the state case\n\nwould be able to preclude Cruz-Berríos's claim concerning the\n\nevents of February 2004.12   Any other individual who wishes to reap\n\nthe benefit of claim preclusion would have the opportunity on\n\nremand to present the district court with evidence that he, too,\n\nwas a personal-capacity defendant in the state case.13      On this\n\n\n     11\n      It is possible that this phrase was meant as a John Doe–style\nplaceholder for as-yet unidentified defendants. If so, then it\nwould raise a question as to whether res judicata principles would\nallow Cruz-Berríos for the first time in his federal complaint to\nfill in who these \"others\" were.     We have previously expressed\ndoubt that a party's presence as a John Doe defendant in one suit\nwould preclude subsequent claims against it as a named party in a\nfuture suit, see Iantosca v. Step Plan Servs., Inc., 604 F.3d 24,\n30 (1st Cir. 2010), but the question would ultimately be governed\nby Puerto Rico law, which might have a different take.       In any\ncase, because the reference to \"others\" could easily mean named\ndefendants, rather than John Does, the question may yet turn out to\nbe academic.\n     12\n      These defendants are Carlos González-Rosario, Miguel Pereira,\nUziel Ruiz-Ledée, and Reinaldo Surén.\n     13\n      To the extent that a personal-capacity defendant in the\nfederal suit was named only as an official-capacity defendant in\nthe state action, we again defer a definitive ruling. Some courts\nhave found privity elastic enough to be asserted defensively by a\ngovernment official who, after prevailing in an official capacity,\nis later sued personally. See 18A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.\n\n                                -17-\n\fissue, like exhaustion under the PLRA, the defense bears the burden\n\nof proof.      Perez-Guzman v. Garcia, 346 F.3d 229, 234 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   But we stress again that all of this becomes necessary only\n\nif   Puerto    Rico's   \"identity   of   parties\"   rule   would   not   allow\n\ndefensive non-mutual issue preclusion on these facts.\n\n\n\n                                    III.\n\n              In summary, our holding varies by claim, by defendant,\n\nand by capacity.        First, we remand for the district court to\n\nconsider whether Cruz-Berríos failed to exhaust all administrative\n\nremedies available to him before initiating his federal action.\n\nResolution of that issue has the potential to dispose of the entire\n\naction without need for further consideration of the res judicata\n\nquestions.\n\n              As to the February 28, 2004, incident, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of the official-capacity claim against\n\nall defendants; we also affirm the district court's dismissal of\n\nthe personal-capacity claim against those defendants already named\n\nas personal-capacity defendants in the state case; but as to the\n\npersonal-capacity claim against those defendants whose party status\n\nin the state case remains unclear, we reverse the dismissal and\n\n\n\nMiller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4458,\nat 570-71 & n.21 (2d ed. 20002). But this question must be decided\nunder Puerto Rico law and is thus another matter for attention in\nthe district court in the first instance, if necessary.\n\n                                    -18-\n\fremand for such further consideration as this opinion requires.\n\nSimilarly, as to the claims concerning the events of August 18,\n\n2004, and March 2, 2005, we reverse the dismissal and remand so\n\nthat the district court may, again depending on the resolution of\n\nthe exhaustion issue, consider whether Puerto Rico law would\n\npreclude claims arising out of post-complaint events that could\n\nhave been but were not incorporated into the state case through an\n\namended complaint.\n\n          Each party shall bear its own costs of appeal.\n\n\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -19-\n\f",

Civil\n\nCode, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31 § 5141, alleging that officers in the\n\nPuerto Rico correctional facility where he was housed had assaulted\n\nhim in retaliation for implicating them in a drug trafficking\n\ninvestigation. His complaint referred to two separate incidents of\n\nabuse, one on November 9, 2002, and another on February 28, 2004.\n\n\n     1\n      Puerto Rico is the functional equivalent of a state for all\npurposes relevant to this case.

Some, though not all, of the named\n\ndefendants in the federal complaint were also defendants in the\n\nstate        court    case.       Cruz-Berríos      twice   amended     the   federal\n\ncomplaint, each time adding a new incident that he claimed had\n\noccurred after the most recent filing.2                     In the first amended\n\ncomplaint,           he   added     additional      corrections        officers    and\n\nadministrators as defendants and included a third assault that had\n\nallegedly occurred on August 18, 2004, which he claimed was part of\n\nthe   same      general       pattern   of    retaliation   as   the    original   two\n\nincidents.           In the second amended complaint, he alleged a fourth\n\nsuch incident, which he claimed occurred on March 2, 2005, and\n\nadded another prison administrator as a defendant.3                    Of these four\n\nalleged incidents, only the claims concerning the last three were\n\npermitted to proceed, as the district court determined that the\n\nclaim arising out of the November 2002 incident was time-barred.4\n\n                Due to developments in the state court case, however,\n\nthose three claims did not proceed very far.                 After a bench trial,\n\n\n        2\n            At no point did Cruz-Berríos amend his state complaint.\n      3\n      In order to avoid a sovereign immunity bar, he also specified\nthat any claims for damages were against the defendants in their\npersonal capacities, while any injunctive relief sought was against\nthe defendants in both their personal and official capacities. See\nEdelman v.

That\n\nadverse judgment, the federal district court later held, precluded\n\nthe § 1983 action in its entirety, including the allegations\n\nagainst the additional defendants concerning incidents that had not\n\npreviously been the subject of litigation.

Offering an alternative means to the same end, they also\n\nassert that Cruz-Berríos failed to exhaust his administrative\n\nremedies before filing his federal claim, in violation of 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1997e(a).   Because the second of these arguments may provide an\n\nuncomplicated means of resolving this case on a more developed\n\nrecord, we begin there.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f                                   A.\n\n           The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PLRA\"), 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1997e(a), provides that \"[n]o action shall be brought with\n\nrespect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or\n\nany other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison,\n\nor other correctional facility until such administrative remedies\n\nas are available are exhausted.\"           This exhaustion requirement\n\napplies to allegations of physical violence by prison guards.\n\nPorter v.

But it was not Cruz-\n\nBerríos's burden to plead exhaustion, which must be raised and\n\nproved by the defense.      Jones v.

And because the district court\n\ndismissed the case on preclusion grounds, it never addressed the\n\nmatter.   Accordingly, we remand the case to the district court for\n\nadditional   fact-finding    as   to    whether   the   PLRA   exhaustion\n\nrequirement bars Cruz-Berríos's suit or not.

The distinction between the claims already\n\nadjudicated and those not already adjudicated remains critical\n\nhere.

At this juncture, it is impossible to tell whether the\n\nconduct newly alleged in the federal case would turn out to be\n\nmeaningfully different from the conduct tried on the merits in the\n\nstate   case.       Further   proceedings     may   establish    that     the    new\n\nallegations are simply more of the same, or they may turn out to be\n\nsomething more egregious.\n\n            The defendants argue that insofar as Cruz-Berríos has\n\nchosen to present the individual incidents as part of a continuing\n\npattern of abuse, the issue posed by the new claims is actually\n\nidentical to the one already adjudicated in state court.

With respect to the plaintiff's official-\n\ncapacity   claim   based   on   the    February    2004   allegations,   the\n\nrepresentative roles of the defendants in this action are the same\n\nas those in the state action.

As we have\n\ndiscussed elsewhere, this sort of argument \"mistakes the legal\n\ncause of action for the factual 'cause' contemplated by Puerto\n\nRico's preclusion statute:      preclusion requires an identity of the\n\nlatter, not the former.\" Baez-Cruz v.

Thus, regardless of the legal vehicle\n\nthrough which an action is brought, claims share a perfect identity\n\nof cause \"when they flow from the same principal ground or origin.\"\n\nR.G. Fin. Corp., 446 F.3d at 183.            So long as the claims \"either\n\nwere or could have been asserted in a prior action\" based on the\n\nsame transaction, they are precludable.            Id.    Similarly, \"[t]wo\n\nactions share an identity of 'things' if a decision in the second\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\faction might function to contradict a right arisen or arising from,\n\nor a right affirmed by a prior decision.\"           Id.

Accordingly, \"a mere difference in\n\nthe legal theories on which two causes of action are grounded does\n\nnot destroy the identity of thing or cause that otherwise exists\n\nbetween two suits arising out of a common nucleus of operative\n\nfact.\"    Id. at 184.    This all amounts to what is known in common\n\nlaw   jurisdictions     as   the   \"transactional     approach\"      to    claim\n\npreclusion.    Id. at 183.\n\n            Here,   Cruz-Berríos's    federal   claim     entails    the    same\n\nfactual cause as was dealt with in the analogous claim in his state\n\nsuit, namely, the officers' conduct on February 28, 2004; the\n\n§ 1983 theory of liability could have originally been raised in his\n\nstate suit, Acevedo v. Srio. Servicios Sociales, 12 P.R. Offic.\n\nTrans. 317 (1982); and a finding of liability in his federal suit\n\nwould    necessarily    contradict    the   Court    of   First     Instance's\n\ndetermination that the corrections officers acted lawfully.                  The\n\nthing and cause, like the identity of the parties, are identical.\n\nThus, Cruz-Berríos's state suit precludes his current official-\n\ncapacity claim against the defendants concerning the events in\n\nFebruary 2004.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f                                   ii.\n\n          Cruz-Berríos's personal-capacity claim, on the other\n\nhand, is not so neatly resolved.         Although the capacity in which\n\nthe defendants are sued does not affect the identities of thing and\n\ncause, there is some possibility that it would affect the identity\n\nof the parties.   At the outset, we note our skepticism that Puerto\n\nRico law would allow a plaintiff who lost against one defendant to\n\nthen bring a new claim against another defendant (to say nothing of\n\na claim against the same defendant merely in a different capacity)\n\nbased on the same transaction where the outcome in the first case\n\neffectively   negates   the    claim     in   the   second.     Were   such\n\nrelitigation permissible, a plaintiff could in principle have as\n\nmany bites of the apple as there were non-privy defendants to be\n\nsued.   This is precisely the sort of outcome that defensive non-\n\nmutual issue preclusion typically guards against.\n\n          At the same time, we are not in a position to convert\n\nthat instinctive skepticism into an authoritative statement that\n\nPuerto Rico law would dispense with its mutuality requirement under\n\nthese circumstances.    So far as we can glean, the case law does not\n\ndefinitively foreclose the possibility that Puerto Rico would\n\nrequire mutuality even under these circumstances.             We therefore\n\nproceed with caution, and will await further development of the\n\ncase, before making any definitive statement as to which result\n\nPuerto Rico law intends.      On remand, the parties and the district\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fcourt should devote some attention to this issue if it proves\n\nnecessary to resolve the case.\n\n           If the personal-capacity claims are indeed subject to\n\nnon-mutual issue preclusion, then the February 2004 claim would be\n\nbarred as to all defendants, and nothing more need be said.          If, on\n\nthe other hand, it turns out that a mutuality requirement does\n\nprevent   preclusion   against   such    newly   named   personal-capacity\n\ndefendants, we would need to take the further step of looking to\n\nsee who was named in the state suit.            It is clear that at least\n\nsome of the newly named defendants were included in the federal\n\ncomplaint solely because of the August 2004 and March 2005 claims.9\n\nSubject to our earlier discussion of post-complaint events, the\n\nCourt of First Instance's decision would not appear to preclude\n\nthose claims against those defendants.10\n\n           Thus, a strict mutuality requirement would necessitate a\n\ncomplete tally of who was named in the first suit.          Unfortunately,\n\nthe record before us contains none.          Its only reference to the\n\nparties   before   the   Court   of     First    Instance   occurs   in   a\n\n\n     9\n      So far as we can tell from our reading of the second amended\ncomplaint, these defendants are:     William Class-Quirós, Santos\nJiménez-Colón, Eddie M. Cruz-Santiago, Erick García-Santos, Enil\nMontalvo-Morales, Osvaldo Rivera-Domínguez, and Wilmer Sepúlveda.\n     10\n      This conclusion, which follows from Puerto Rico's \"identity\nof parties\" requirement, seems inconsistent with the extension of\nres judicata to post-complaint events, even those involving\nnonparties, as the district court appears to have assumed. But we\nleave it to the litigants and the district court on remand to\nconsider in the first instance what the actual state of the law is.\n\n                                  -16-\n\fnonexhaustive list appearing in a Puerto Rico appeals court's\n\nrecitation of facts in the underlying case.

At the very least, any individual\n\nclearly named as a personal-capacity defendant in the state case\n\nwould be able to preclude Cruz-Berríos's claim concerning the\n\nevents of February 2004.12   Any other individual who wishes to reap\n\nthe benefit of claim preclusion would have the opportunity on\n\nremand to present the district court with evidence that he, too,\n\nwas a personal-capacity defendant in the state case.13      On this\n\n\n     11\n      It is possible that this phrase was meant as a John Doe–style\nplaceholder for as-yet unidentified defendants. If so, then it\nwould raise a question as to whether res judicata principles would\nallow Cruz-Berríos for the first time in his federal complaint to\nfill in who these \"others\" were.     We have previously expressed\ndoubt that a party's presence as a John Doe defendant in one suit\nwould preclude subsequent claims against it as a named party in a\nfuture suit, see Iantosca v. Step Plan Servs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145519\"><a href=\"/opinion/145519/iantosca-v-step-plan-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n30 (1st Cir. 2010), but the question would ultimately be governed\nby Puerto Rico law, which might have a different take.       In any\ncase, because the reference to \"others\" could easily mean named\ndefendants, rather than John Does, the question may yet turn out to\nbe academic.\n     12\n      These defendants are Carlos González-Rosario, Miguel Pereira,\nUziel Ruiz-Ledée, and Reinaldo Surén.\n     13\n      To the extent that a personal-capacity defendant in the\nfederal suit was named only as an official-capacity defendant in\nthe state action, we again defer a definitive ruling. Some courts\nhave found privity elastic enough to be asserted defensively by a\ngovernment official who, after prevailing in an official capacity,\nis later sued personally. See 18A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.\n\n                                -17-\n\fissue, like exhaustion under the PLRA, the defense bears the burden\n\nof proof.      Perez-Guzman v. Garcia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200687\"><a href=\"/opinion/200687/perez-guzman-v-commonwealth-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 234 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   But we stress again that all of this becomes necessary only\n\nif   Puerto    Rico's   \"identity   of   parties\"   rule   would   not   allow\n\ndefensive non-mutual issue preclusion on these facts.\n\n\n\n                                    III.\n\n              In summary, our holding varies by claim, by defendant,\n\nand by capacity.        First, we remand for the district court to\n\nconsider whether Cruz-Berríos failed to exhaust all administrative\n\nremedies available to him before initiating his federal action.\n\nResolution of that issue has the potential to dispose of the entire\n\naction without need for further consideration of the res judicata\n\nquestions.\n\n              As to the February 28, 2004, incident, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of the official-capacity claim against\n\nall defendants; we also affirm the district court's dismissal of\n\nthe personal-capacity claim against those defendants already named\n\nas personal-capacity defendants in the state case; but as to the\n\npersonal-capacity claim against those defendants whose party status\n\nin the state case remains unclear, we reverse the dismissal and\n\n\n\nMiller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4458,\nat 570-71 & n.21 (2d ed. 20002). But this question must be decided\nunder Puerto Rico law and is thus another matter for attention in\nthe district court in the first instance, if necessary.\n\n                                    -18-\n\fremand for such further consideration as this opinion requires.\n\nSimilarly, as to the claims concerning the events of August 18,\n\n2004, and March 2, 2005, we reverse the dismissal and remand so\n\nthat the district court may, again depending on the resolution of\n\nthe exhaustion issue, consider whether Puerto Rico law would\n\npreclude claims arising out of post-complaint events that could\n\nhave been but were not incorporated into the state case through an\n\namended complaint.\n\n          Each party shall bear its own costs of appeal.\n\n\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -19-\n\f</pre>",
