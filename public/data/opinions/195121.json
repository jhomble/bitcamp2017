This appeal arises from a civil action\n                    \n\nbrought by the  named fiduciary of a pension  plan to recover\n\ncertain  assets  alleged   to  be  wrongfully  held   by  the\n\nadministrator of another pension plan.   The plaintiff is the\n\nPension Administration Committee of the Sheraton  Corporation\n\nRetirement  Plan for  Salaried Employees  (\"the  PAC\").   The\n\ndefendant  is William  J.  Carroll  d/b/a Carroll  Consulting\n\nActuaries (Carroll).  Pursuant  to Fed. R. Civ. P.  37(b)(2),\n\nthe district court entered a default judgment against Carroll\n\nfor his  failure to  comply with  multiple orders  compelling\n\ndiscovery.   Carroll now  appeals from the  default judgment.\n\nWe affirm. \n\n                          Background\n                                    \n\n     The PAC  commenced this  action by  filing a  five-count\n\ncomplaint which stated  claims for relief under  the Employee\n\nRetirement Income Security  Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),  29 U.S.C.\n\n 1001  et.  seq.,  the Declaratory  Judgment  Act,  28 U.S.C.\n                \n\n 2201,  federal  common law,  and state  law.   The complaint\n\nalleged the following facts.\n\n     PGA Resort  Ltd. (PGA),  a Florida limited  partnership,\n\nowned  the  former Sheraton  PGA  Resort Hotel  in  West Palm\n\nBeach,  Florida.   In 1980,  PGA  began providing  retirement\n\nbenefits for its salaried and hourly employees.  PGA provided\n\nthose  benefits by becoming  a participating employer  in the\n\nPension Plan and Trust for  Hotels and Motor Inns  Associated\n\n                             -2-\n\nWith  The  Sheraton Corporation  (Plan  I).    Under Plan  I,\n\nindividual  owners  of hotels  associated  with  the Sheraton\n\nCorporation (Sheraton)  adopted  as their  pension plans  the\n\nterms of  two \"master\" documents  - a Pension  Plan Agreement\n\nand a  Pension Trust Agreement  (the Plan Documents).   These\n\ndocuments  provided  that  a   participating  employer  could\n\nwithdraw  from  Plan  I and  establish  a  separate qualified\n\npension  or  retirement  plan  provided  that  the  new  plan\n\nprovided   equal  or  greater  rights  and  benefits  to  the\n\nemployees covered by Plan I.                   Under  Plan I,\n\nPGA and other participating employers made contributions to a\n\ncommon  trust fund which  was held by  the Bank of  Boston as\n\ntrustee.  The  Plan Documents further provided  that, upon an\n\nemployer's   withdrawal  from  Plan  I,  the  assets  in  the\n\nparticipating  employer's   account  in   Plan  I   shall  be\n\ntransferred to the trustee designated by the employer.\n\n     Carroll is  the administrator  for Plan I.   He  has the\n\nduty  to  account  separately for  the  Plan  assets of  each\n\nparticipating  employer   and  exclusive  control   over  the\n\ndisposition of Plan  I's assets.  The  complaint alleged that\n\nas  a result  of  the  following  events,  Carroll  continued\n\nimproperly  to  exercise  control over  the  assets  in PGA's\n\naccount in Plan I.\n\n      In 1986, PGA  decided to participate  in a new  pension\n\nplan (Plan II) that preserved  the rights and benefits of all\n\n                             -3-\n\nPGA employees  covered by  Plan I, in  addition to  providing\n\nother benefits.1   PGA informed  Carroll of its  intention to\n\nwithdraw from  Plan I.   Carroll informed PGA and  its agent,\n\nthe  actuarial firm  of  Towers,  Perrin,  Forster  &amp;  Crosby\n\n(TPF&amp;C), that  a new pension  plan and trust approved  by the\n\nInternal  Revenue Service (IRS) was the only authorization he\n\nrequired to transfer  PGA's assets to the trustee  of the new\n\npension plan.  PGA subsequently adopted Plan II and requested\n\na ruling from  the IRS that  Plan II was a  qualified pension\n\nplan under 26 U.S.C.  401(a).   The IRS issued such a  ruling\n\nin  1988.  Thereafter,  TPF&amp;C instructed Carroll  to transfer\n\nPGA's assets in  Plan I to the Shawmut  Bank, the trustee for\n\nPlan II.  The complaint alleged that despite PGA's compliance\n\nwith the requirements  for transferring the assets  set forth\n\nin Plan I  and Carroll's own  conditions, Carroll refused  to\n\ntransfer PGA's assets without justification.2  \n\n     Effective January  1, 1989,  PGA discontinued  providing\n\nretirement  benefits  to  its  employees.    Pursuant  to  an\n\nagreement between  PGA  and  Sheraton,  the  liabilities  and\n\nassets of Plan II were merged into a third pension  plan, the\n\n                    \n\n1.  Plan II is also known as the Sheraton Salaried and Hourly\nRetirement Plans and Trusts for Managed Hotels.\n\n2.  The  complaint further  alleged that  TPF&amp;C made  further\ndemands  on Carroll  to  transfer  PGA's  assets  during  the\nremainder  of 1988.  Carroll continued to retain control over\nthe  assets.   In December,  1988, Carroll  urged the  IRS to\nrescind its  favorable determination letters  concerning Plan\nII.  The IRS did not do so. \n\n                             -4-\n\nSheraton Corporation  Retirement Plan for  Salaried Employees\n\n(Plan  III).   The  PAC  is  the  administrator and  a  named\n\nfiduciary of Plan III.  See 29 U.S.C.   1102(16)(A), 1102(a).\n                           \n\nThe  complaint alleged  that  at the  time  this merger  took\n\nplace, PGA's  assets in  Plan I were  the lawful  property of\n\nPlan II and thus  should have been received by Plan  III as a\n\nresult  of the merger.  However, Carroll improperly continued\n\nto  refuse  to  transfer PGA's  assets  to  Plan  III despite\n\nmultiple  demands by  PGA,  its  agents, and  the  PAC.   The\n\ncomplaint alleged  that PGA's  assets in  Plan I  (hereafter,\n\n\"the Assets\") have been the lawful property of Plan III since\n\nJanuary  1, 1989  and that  Carroll's  improper retention  of\n\ncontrol over the Assets is  in derogation of Plan III's right\n\nto possession and control.   The PAC commenced this action to\n\ncompel Carroll to  transfer the Assets to Plan III. According\n\nto the complaint, Carroll's most  recent accounting indicated\n\nthat the Assets were worth at least $230,000.  \n\n     The  first  two  counts of  the  complaint  alleged that\n\nCarroll's improper refusal to transfer the Assets constituted\n\na breach of his fiduciary duty to act solely in  the interest\n\nof the participants and beneficiaries of Plan I in  violation\n\nof 29 U.S.C.  1104(a)(1), and  a breach of his fiduciary duty\n\nto  act  in  accordance with  the  documents  and instruments\n\n                             -5-\n\ngoverning Plan I  in violation of 29  U.S.C.  1104(a)(1)(D).3\n\nCarroll's refusal  to transfer  the Assets  also was  said to\n\nviolate of the terms of  Plan I.  These violations were  said\n\nto  entitle the  PAC to  an order  compelling Carroll  to (1)\n\ndirect the Bank of Boston, the trustee of Plan I, to transfer\n\nall assets in PGA's account in Plan I to the trustee for Plan\n\nIII, Northern Trust Company, and,  (2) provide the PAC with a\n\nfinal accounting  of the assets  in PGA's account in  Plan I.\n\nThe PAC claimed  this relief under ERISA's  civil enforcement\n\nprovision,  29  U.S.C.  1132(a)(3).4      Count  II sought  a\n\n                    \n\n3.  29 U.S.C.  1104(a) provides, in relevant part, that:\n\n     (1) Subject to sections 1103 (c) and (d), 1342, and\n     1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge his\n     duties  with  respect  to  a  plan  solely  in  the\n     interest of the participants and beneficiaries and\n\n                    *      *      *\n\n          (D) in accordance with the documents  and\n          instruments governing the plan insofar as\n          such   documents   and   instruments  are\n          consistent  with the  provisions of  this\n          subchapter  and  subchapter III  of  this\n          chapter.     \n\n4.  29 U.S.C.  1132(a) provides that, \n\n          A civil action may be brought -\n                    *    *    *\n          (3)  by  a participant,  beneficiary,  or\n          fiduciary  (A)  to  enjoin  any  act   or\n          practice which violates  any provision of\n          this subchapter or the terms of the plan,\n          or  (B)   to  obtain   other  appropriate\n          equitable  relief  (i)  to  redress  such\n          violations   or  (ii)   to  enforce   any\n          provisions  of  this  subchapter  or  the\n          terms of the plan; ....      \n\n                             -6-\n\ndeclaratory  judgment that the PAC, not Carroll, was entitled\n\nto possession  and control of  the Assets in addition  to the\n\naforementioned  equitable relief. Counts four and five of the\n\ncomplaint  stated common law  claims for breach  of fiduciary\n\nduty and conversion and claimed damages in an amount not less\n\nthan the market value of the Assets.5\n\n                      Procedural History\n                                        \n\n     Throughout the course of  the proceedings below, Carroll\n\nmaintained that since  the summons  and complaint  identified\n\nhim   as  \"William  J.   Carroll  d/b/a   Carroll  Consulting\n\nActuaries,\" he had been sued in his individual capacity only,\n\nand therefore lacked the ability to respond to the  complaint\n\nand  the PAC's  discovery  requests in  his  capacity as  the\n\nadministrator of Plan I.   Thus, the PAC filed a request  for\n\nproduction of documents shortly after it filed its complaint.\n\nThat  request  sought  all  correspondence, notes  and  files\n\nrelating to PGA, its pension plans, or the Assets, as well as\n\nall  correspondence between Carroll  and any other  person or\n\nentity relating  to Carroll's  role as  the administrator  of\n\nPlan I.\n\n     Carroll  initially did  not  file  a  response  to  this\n\nrequest for production of documents.  Instead, proceeding pro\n                                                             \n\nse, he  filed an \"Objection  to Complaint and Motion  to Stay\n  \n\n                    \n\n5.  The complaint  also  claimed attorney's  fees  and  costs\nunder 29 U.S.C.  1132(g).\n\n                             -7-\n\nProceedings.\"   This document  alleged, inter alia,  that the\n                                                  \n\nPAC lacked the standing to bring this action and that Carroll\n\nlacked the capacity to defend it since he  had been sued only\n\nin  his individual capacity.6   Carroll withdrew  this motion\n\nbefore it was heard.  On  June 5, 1992, an initial scheduling\n\nconference  (ISC) was held before  the district court.  After\n\nexplaining to Carroll that the  PAC was entitled to  discover\n\nthe  documents it had  requested, the district  judge ordered\n\nCarroll to produce the  requisite documents by June  26, 1992\n\nand to submit  to a deposition on August 10th and 11th, 1992.\n\nA  written order embodying  these requirements was  issued on\n\nJune 10, 1992.\n\n     On June 26, 1992, Carroll  filed a response to the PAC's\n\nrequest for production of documents.  For the most part, that\n\nresponse  denied   that  Carroll   possessed  the   requested\n\ndocuments in his individual capacity  and expressly disavowed\n\nthe capacity or authority to  respond to the PAC's request as\n\nthe  administrator of  Plan I.7   On  July  2, 1992,  the PAC\n\n                    \n\n6.  We  note that attached to this motion were twelve letters\nand an incomplete list of other documents in Carroll's files.\nThese  appear  to be  responsive  to  the PAC's  request  for\nproduction of documents, albeit incomplete.  \n\n7.  Several letters between Carroll  and various parties were\nattached  to the  response, as  well as  accountings for  the\nHourly and  Salaried Pension  Plans from  1983 through  1990.\nThese  documents and those that were  attached to his initial\nobjection to the complaint indicate that Carroll's claim that\nhe did not possess the documents is disingenuous.\n\n                             -8-\n\nfiled  a motion  to compel  production  of documents  and for\n\nsanctions.   The motion  stated that  Carroll had  refused to\n\nproduce   documents  based  on   his  meritless   attempt  to\n\ndistinguish documents he possessed in an individual  capacity\n\nand documents he  possessed in his capacity  as administrator\n\nof Plan  I.8  On  August 14, 1992, the  district court denied\n\nCarroll's motion  for disqualification and allowed  the PAC's\n\nmotion to compel production  of documents.  The court  issued\n\nan order that required Carroll to produce all documents which\n\nhe held in his individual or representative capacity.9  \n\n     By  letter dated  August  20, 1992,  plaintiff's counsel\n\nnotified Carroll to produce the requisite documents by August\n\n24th  and to appear for his deposition  on August 28th.  Once\n\nagain, Carroll did not comply. On  August 31,  1992, the  PAC\n\nfiled a motion  for sanctions based  on Carroll's failure  to\n\ncomply  with the district  court's August  14, 1992  order to\n\nproduce documents and on his subsequent failure to appear for\n\nhis deposition on August 28th.   The PAC also filed  a motion\n\nfor summary judgment on August 31,  1992.  In support of this\n\nmotion,  the PAC filed multiple affidavits, including that of\n\n                    \n\n8.  Carroll filed  a rambling  and prolix  opposition to  the\nPAC's  motion to compel  which raised no  meritorious issues.\nHe also filed a motion to disqualify the district judge based\non her alleged pro-plaintiff bias.\n\n9.  Carroll  appealed  the   order  denying  his  motion   to\ndisqualify the district judge and the order compelling him to\nproduce the requested  documents.  This court  dismissed both\nappeals on October 29, 1992.\n\n                             -9-\n\nKathy  Bascik,  Sheraton's  Director  of  Employee  Benefits.\n\nBascik averred that  after Plans II and III  merged, Plan III\n\nbegan  paying  claims  submitted  by  the   participants  and\n\nbeneficiaries  of PGA's pension  plans.  She  further averred\n\nthat  Plan III  would continue  to  pay all  valid claims  of\n\nparticipants  and  beneficiaries  of   PGA's  pension  plans,\n\nalthough Plan  III  had been  deprived  of the  assets  which\n\ncorrespond  to these  liabilities as  a  result of  Carroll's\n\nrefusal to transfer PGA's assets in Plan I.\n\n    The district court  did not rule on the  PAC's motion for\n\nsanctions  while its  motion  for summary  judgment  remained\n\nunder advisement.   On November 3,  1992, the district  court\n\ndenied  that motion  on  the ground  that  genuine issues  of\n\nmaterial fact remained about the validity of the amendment to\n\nPlan  I and  the validity  of Plan II.   Thereafter,  the PAC\n\nresumed its efforts to secure discovery from Carroll.\n\n     On   December  18,  1992,   the  PAC  noticed  Carroll's\n\ndeposition  for January 5,  1993.  Anticipating  that Carroll\n\nwould not comply on the ground that he could not do so in his\n\nindividual capacity,  plaintiff's counsel  subpoenaed Carroll\n\nfor this  deposition in his capacity as  the administrator of\n\nPlan I.   The subpoena  also required Carroll to  produce the\n\npreviously  requested documents by January 4,  1993.  The PAC\n\nalso requested  a ruling  on its August  31, 1992  motion for\n\nsanctions.     On   December   29,  1992,   Carroll  informed\n\n                             -10-\n\nplaintiff's  counsel  that  counsel   was  being  engaged  to\n\nrepresent  Plan I and that he would  be unable to comply with\n\nthe subpoena for his deposition.10\n\n     On January 5, 1993, the district court allowed the PAC's\n\nmotion for sanctions.  The court ordered Carroll to pay $2000\n\nto  the plaintiff forthwith  as partial compensation  for the\n\ncosts  it  had  incurred  in  its  unsuccessful  attempts  to\n\ndiscover documents  and depose him.11   On January  13, 1993,\n\nhaving received no  payment from  Carroll, the  PAC moved  to\n\ndefault Carroll  pursuant to Fed.  R. Civ. P. 37(b)  and (d).\n\nThe motion was based on Carroll's willful refusal to obey the\n\ndistrict court's orders to produce documents and submit to  a\n\ndeposition as well as the order compelling Carroll to pay the\n\n$2000 sanction for his past misconduct.12\n\n     On March 10, 1993, the  district court held a hearing on\n\nthe PAC's motion for a  default judgment.  Despite  Carroll's\n\n                    \n\n10.  We note  that Carroll  has proceeded  pro se  throughout\n                                                 \nthis litigation and never secured counsel.\n\n11.  On  January 25, 1993,  Carroll filed a  notice of appeal\nfrom the sanction  order.  We dismissed that  appeal for lack\nof jurisdiction on March 17, 1993.\n\n12.  On January 18, 1993, Carroll forwarded a $2000 check  to\nthe  Senior Counsel  for ITT  Corporation (Sheraton's  parent\ncorporation) in New  York.  While the check  was made payable\nto  the  PAC,  it included  a  list  of conditions  seemingly\ndesigned to render it non-negotiable.  For example, the check\nindicated that it was good for 30 days only.  An accompanying\ndocument  provided that the PAC's  deposit of the check would\nconstitute   an  admission   against   its  interest.   Thus,\nplaintiff's counsel was unable to use this check. \n\n                             -11-\n\nobstinacy, the court  deferred ruling on the motion  and gave\n\nCarroll one last chance.  The court ordered Carroll to appear\n\nfor  his deposition  on March  15,  1993 and  to produce  the\n\nrequested  documents at  his  deposition.    In  making  this\n\nruling,  the court explained to Carroll  that he was required\n\nto  appear and  answer  questions  in  whatever  capacity  he\n\nthought  he was acting  with respects  to the  pension plans.\n\n(Supp. App.  pp. 255-60).   Carroll responded, \"I  don't know\n\nwhat you mean by me[,]\"  and repeatedly protested that he was\n\nnot  able to  comply with  discovery in  his capacity  as the\n\nadministrator  of Plan  I  because  he had  been  sued as  an\n\nindividual.   The court  specifically  instructed Carroll  to\n\nanswer \"whatever  question is put  to you\" and to  \"have with\n\nyou all  the documents that  pertain to the pension  plan. It\n\ndoesn't matter  whether you are William  Carroll, personally,\n\nWilliam    Carroll,    trustee,   William    Carroll,    plan\n\nadministrator,  you  will  appear  with  all the  documents.\"\n\n(Supp. App. pp.  260, 272).  When Carroll  protested, \"I hear\n\nthe words,  but I  don't understand the  meaning,\" the  court\n\nurged him to try, noting that, \"[i]f you don't succeed, there\n\nwill be  further sanctions against you Mr.  Carroll.\"  (Supp.\n\nApp. p.  273). The court  further ordered Carroll to  issue a\n\n$2000 check  to  plaintiff's  counsel  without  restrictions.\n\n(Supp. App. p. 278).  \n\n                             -12-\n\n     On March 11,  1993, the district court issued  a written\n\norder  embodying  its  oral orders  from  the  previous day's\n\nhearing.  Carroll failed to appear for his deposition and did\n\nnot pay the $2000 sanction.  On March 17, 1993, the PAC filed\n\na  renewed  motion   to  default  Carroll  and   for  further\n\nsanctions.  Carroll  filed a response  in which he  indicated\n\nthat he  agreed that a  default was \"the desired  solution of\n\nthe moment\" because he wanted to get this case before another\n\ncourt.  The  court scheduled a hearing on  the renewed motion\n\nto default Carroll  for April 27, 1992.   In response  to the\n\nhearing  notice, Carroll  filed  another rambling  and prolix\n\ndocument generally protesting  his treatment in  the district\n\ncourt while  announcing that  he would  not be  attending the\n\nhearing  on the  default  motion.   On  April  27, 1993,  the\n\ndistrict court defaulted  Carroll under Fed.  R. Civ. P.  37.\n\nThe  court  specifically  found  that Carroll  willfully  and\n\npersistently  refused to obey  the court's  orders, including\n\nthe August 14, 1992 order to produce documents, the March 10-\n\n11,  1993  oral   and  written  orders  to  appear   for  his\n\ndeposition,  and the January  5, 1993 sanction  order. (Supp.\n\nApp.  pp. 285-86).    The  court  also  required  plaintiff's\n\ncounsel to prepare a proposed judgment.   On May 5, 1993, the\n\ndistrict court entered a judgment against Carroll on counts I\n\nthrough V of  the complaint.  The judgment  declared that the\n\nPAC had the right to possession and control  of the assets in\n\n                             -13-\n\nthe  account(s) of  PGA in  Plan I,  and ordered  Carroll, in\n\nwhatever capacity necessary,  to forthwith  direct the  First\n\nNational Bank of  Boston (the trustee of Plan  I) to transfer\n\nall  assets in  PGA's account(s)  in Plan  I to  the Northern\n\nTrust Company,  the trustee of  Plan III.  The  judgment also\n\nrequired Carroll to  provide plaintiff's counsel with  a full\n\nand complete accounting of the assets in  PGA's account(s) in\n\nPlan  I and  to  personally pay  plaintiff's  costs under  29\n\nU.S.C.  1132(g).   (Supp. App. pp. 288-89).   Carroll filed a\n\ntimely notice of appeal.13\n\n                           Analysis\n                                   \n\n     \"Federal Rule 37 empowers a district court to make  such\n\norders as  'are just'  when a  party fails  to comply with  a\n\ndiscovery order, placing the court's handling of such matters\n\nbeyond  appellate  review when  there  has been  no  abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\" Local Union No. 251  v. Town Line Sand &amp; Gravel,\n                                                             \n\nInc.,  511 F.2d 1198, 1199 (1st  Cir. 1975).  On this record,\n    \n\n                    \n\n13.  Carroll  filed a  motion for  reconsideration before  he\nfiled his notice of appeal.  The motion did not object to the\nentry  of the  default per  se.   Rather,  Carroll sought  to\nrevise the substance of the judgment.  On June 11, 1993, this\ncourt ordered  Carroll to show  cause why this  appeal should\nnot  be  dismissed   for  lack  of  jurisdiction   given  the\noutstanding motion for reconsideration.  In response, Carroll\nfiled  a notice  withdrawing his  motion for  reconsideration\nwith the district  court.  We allowed this  appeal to proceed\nand directed both parties to brief the jurisdictional issues.\nRegrettably, neither party has done  so.  As we conclude that\nCarroll is not entitled to relief on the merits, we  need not\naddress  the jurisdictional issues.   See Norton  v. Mathews,\n                                                            \n427 U.S. 524, 530-32 (1976). \n\n                             -14-\n\nwe have no  hesitation in concluding that the  district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion  in defaulting Carroll.  In view\n\nof Carroll's  repeated violations  of the  court's orders  to\n\nproduce documents and submit to  a deposition, not to mention\n\nhis  failure to  pay the  $2000 sanction,  we think  that the\n\ndistrict court exhibited extraordinary patience.  The default\n\njudgment was wholly justified.\n\n     On  appeal, Carroll  argues that  the orders  compelling\n\ndiscovery were erroneous because they directed him to provide\n\ninformation  in his capacity  as the administrator  of Plan I\n\nwhen  he  had only  been  sued  in his  individual  capacity.\n\nCarroll  claims that  this alleged  technical  defect in  the\n\nsummons and  complaint disabled  him from  responding to  the\n\nPAC's  discovery  efforts.  He   contends  that  the  default\n\njudgment sanctioned him for the conduct of a non-party - i.e.\n                                                             \n\n- William J. Carroll, Administrator of Plan  I, and therefore\n\nis not \"just\" within the meaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2).\n\n     Like  the district court,  we refuse to  indulge in such\n\nwillful  blindness.     Carroll  concedes  that  he   is  the\n\nadministrator of  Plan I  and  the record  discloses that  he\n\npossesses numerous documents responsive  to the PAC's request\n\nfor production.   Carroll's  feigned inability  to comply  is\n\nindicative of bad faith, which further justifies the default.\n\nSee  Eisler  v.  Stritzler,  535  F.2d  148,  153  (1st  Cir.\n                          \n\n                             -15-\n\n1976)(upholding default judgment where defendant acted in bad\n\nfaith throughout litigation).\n\n     Carroll  also assails the  default judgment under ERISA,\n\nraising a host of arguments.  He claims that the amendment to\n\nPlan I which  created Plan II is invalid, thus  Plan II never\n\nacquired a  right to  PGA's assets.   Carroll further  argues\n\nthat  ERISA  does  not recognize  mergers  of  pension plans,\n\ntherefore the merger of Plans II  and III also is invalid and\n\nthe PAC  has no  right to  PGA's assets  as a  result of  the\n\nmerger, apart from  the invalidity of Plan II.   Carroll also\n\ncontends that the PAC lacks standing to sue because it is not\n\na  \"person\"  and therefore  cannot  be a  fiduciary  under 29\n\nU.S.C.   1002(9) and 21(A).    Each of these claims have been\n\nwaived by Carroll's accession to the default.  \"[A]n entry of\n\ndefault  against  a  defendant  establishes  the  defendant's\n\nliability.\"    Goldman,  Antonetti, Ferraiuo-Li,  Axtmayer  &amp;\n                                                             \n\nHertell v.

Insofar as these  contentions\n\nattack the liability finding, they come too late.\n\n     Carroll's remaining arguments are equally without merit,\n\nand  largely unintelligible.   We particularly note  that the\n\ndistrict  judge did  not  abuse  her  discretion  in  denying\n\nCarroll's multiple  motions to disqualify  her.   It is  well\n\nestablished  that \"[p]rior adverse  rulings alone  cannot, of\n\ncourse,  be the  basis for  a motion  to recuse.\"   Panzardi-\n                                                             \n\n                             -16-\n\nAlvarez v.

The plaintiff is the Pension Administration Committee of the Sheraton Corporation Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees (\"the PAC\").  The defendant is William J. Carroll d/b/a Carroll Consulting Actuaries (Carroll).  Pursuant to Fed.  R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2), the district court entered a default judgment against Carroll for his failure to comply with multiple orders compelling discovery.  Carroll now appeals from the default judgment.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PAC commenced this action by filing a five-count complaint which stated claims for relief under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 et. seq., the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2201, federal common law, and state law.  The complaint alleged the following facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PGA Resort Ltd.  (PGA), a Florida limited partnership, owned the former Sheraton PGA Resort Hotel in West Palm Beach, Florida.  In 1980, PGA began providing retirement benefits for its salaried and hourly employees.  PGA provided those benefits by becoming a participating employer in the Pension Plan and Trust for Hotels and Motor Inns Associated With The Sheraton Corporation (Plan I).  Under Plan I, individual owners of hotels associated with the Sheraton Corporation (Sheraton) adopted as their pension plans the terms of two \"master\" documents a Pension Plan Agreement and a Pension Trust Agreement (the Plan Documents).  These documents provided that a participating employer could withdraw from Plan I and establish a separate qualified pension or retirement plan provided that the new plan provided equal or greater rights and benefits to the employees covered by Plan I.  Under Plan I, PGA and other participating employers made contributions to a common trust fund which was held by the Bank of Boston as trustee.  The Plan Documents further provided that, upon an employer's withdrawal from Plan I, the assets in the participating employer's account in Plan I shall be transferred to the trustee designated by the employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carroll is the administrator for Plan I. He has the duty to account separately for the Plan assets of each participating employer and exclusive control over the disposition of Plan I's assets.  The complaint alleged that as a result of the following events, Carroll continued improperly to exercise control over the assets in PGA's account in Plan I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, PGA decided to participate in a new pension plan (Plan II) that preserved the rights and benefits of all PGA employees covered by Plan I, in addition to providing other benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  PGA informed Carroll of its intention to withdraw from Plan I. Carroll informed PGA and its agent, the actuarial firm of Towers, Perrin, Forster &amp; Crosby (TPF &amp; C), that a new pension plan and trust approved by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was the only authorization he required to transfer PGA's assets to the trustee of the new pension plan.  PGA subsequently adopted Plan II and requested a ruling from the IRS that Plan II was a qualified pension plan under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 401(a).  The IRS issued such a ruling in 1988.  Thereafter, TPF &amp; C instructed Carroll to transfer PGA's assets in Plan I to the Shawmut Bank, the trustee for Plan II.  The complaint alleged that despite PGA's compliance with the requirements for transferring the assets set forth in Plan I and Carroll's own conditions, Carroll refused to transfer PGA's assets without justification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Effective January 1, 1989, PGA discontinued providing retirement benefits to its employees.  Pursuant to an agreement between PGA and Sheraton, the liabilities and assets of Plan II were merged into a third pension plan, the Sheraton Corporation Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees (Plan III).  The PAC is the administrator and a named fiduciary of Plan III.  See 29 U.S.C. Secs. 1102(16)(A), 1102(a).  The complaint alleged that at the time this merger took place, PGA's assets in Plan I were the lawful property of Plan II and thus should have been received by Plan III as a result of the merger.  However, Carroll improperly continued to refuse to transfer PGA's assets to Plan III despite multiple demands by PGA, its agents, and the PAC.  The complaint alleged that PGA's assets in Plan I (hereafter, \"the Assets\") have been the lawful property of Plan III since January 1, 1989 and that Carroll's improper retention of control over the Assets is in derogation of Plan III's right to possession and control.  The PAC commenced this action to compel Carroll to transfer the Assets to Plan III.  According to the complaint, Carroll's most recent accounting indicated that the Assets were worth at least $230,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two counts of the complaint alleged that Carroll's improper refusal to transfer the Assets constituted a breach of his fiduciary duty to act solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of Plan I in violation of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1104(a)(1), and a breach of his fiduciary duty to act in accordance with the documents and instruments governing Plan I in violation of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1104(a)(1)(D).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Carroll's refusal to transfer the Assets also was said to violate of the terms of Plan I. These violations were said to entitle the PAC to an order compelling Carroll to (1) direct the Bank of Boston, the trustee of Plan I, to transfer all assets in PGA's account in Plan I to the trustee for Plan III, Northern Trust Company, and, (2) provide the PAC with a final accounting of the assets in PGA's account in Plan I. The PAC claimed this relief under ERISA's civil enforcement provision, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(a)(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Count II sought a declaratory judgment that the PAC, not Carroll, was entitled to possession and control of the Assets in addition to the aforementioned equitable relief.  Counts four and five of the complaint stated common law claims for breach of fiduciary duty and conversion and claimed damages in an amount not less than the market value of the Assets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the course of the proceedings below, Carroll maintained that since the summons and complaint identified him as \"William J. Carroll d/b/a Carroll Consulting Actuaries,\" he had been sued in his individual capacity only, and therefore lacked the ability to respond to the complaint and the PAC's discovery requests in his capacity as the administrator of Plan I. Thus, the PAC filed a request for production of documents shortly after it filed its complaint.  That request sought all correspondence, notes and files relating to PGA, its pension plans, or the Assets, as well as all correspondence between Carroll and any other person or entity relating to Carroll's role as the administrator of Plan I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carroll initially did not file a response to this request for production of documents.  Instead, proceeding pro se, he filed an \"Objection to Complaint and Motion to Stay Proceedings.\"  This document alleged, inter alia, that the PAC lacked the standing to bring this action and that Carroll lacked the capacity to defend it since he had been sued only in his individual capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Carroll withdrew this motion before it was heard.  On June 5, 1992, an initial scheduling conference (ISC) was held before the district court.  After explaining to Carroll that the PAC was entitled to discover the documents it had requested, the district judge ordered Carroll to produce the requisite documents by June 26, 1992 and to submit to a deposition on August 10th and 11th, 1992.  A written order embodying these requirements was issued on June 10, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, 1992, Carroll filed a response to the PAC's request for production of documents.  For the most part, that response denied that Carroll possessed the requested documents in his individual capacity and expressly disavowed the capacity or authority to respond to the PAC's request as the administrator of Plan I.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  On July 2, 1992, the PAC filed a motion to compel production of documents and for sanctions.  The motion stated that Carroll had refused to produce documents based on his meritless attempt to distinguish documents he possessed in an individual capacity and documents he possessed in his capacity as administrator of Plan I.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  On August 14, 1992, the district court denied Carroll's motion for disqualification and allowed the PAC's motion to compel production of documents.  The court issued an order that required Carroll to produce all documents which he held in his individual or representative capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated August 20, 1992, plaintiff's counsel notified Carroll to produce the requisite documents by August 24th and to appear for his deposition on August 28th.  Once again, Carroll did not comply.  On August 31, 1992, the PAC filed a motion for sanctions based on Carroll's failure to comply with the district court's August 14, 1992 order to produce documents and on his subsequent failure to appear for his deposition on August 28th.  The PAC also filed a motion for summary judgment on August 31, 1992.  In support of this motion, the PAC filed multiple affidavits, including that of Kathy Bascik, Sheraton's Director of Employee Benefits.  Bascik averred that after Plans II and III merged, Plan III began paying claims submitted by the participants and beneficiaries of PGA's pension plans.  She further averred that Plan III would continue to pay all valid claims of participants and beneficiaries of PGA's pension plans, although Plan III had been deprived of the assets which correspond to these liabilities as a result of Carroll's refusal to transfer PGA's assets in Plan I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not rule on the PAC's motion for sanctions while its motion for summary judgment remained under advisement.  On November 3, 1992, the district court denied that motion on the ground that genuine issues of material fact remained about the validity of the amendment to Plan I and the validity of Plan II.  Thereafter, the PAC resumed its efforts to secure discovery from Carroll.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 18, 1992, the PAC noticed Carroll's deposition for January 5, 1993.  Anticipating that Carroll would not comply on the ground that he could not do so in his individual capacity, plaintiff's counsel subpoenaed Carroll for this deposition in his capacity as the administrator of Plan I. The subpoena also required Carroll to produce the previously requested documents by January 4, 1993.  The PAC also requested a ruling on its August 31, 1992 motion for sanctions.  On December 29, 1992, Carroll informed plaintiff's counsel that counsel was being engaged to represent Plan I and that he would be unable to comply with the subpoena for his deposition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 5, 1993, the district court allowed the PAC's motion for sanctions.  The court ordered Carroll to pay $2000 to the plaintiff forthwith as partial compensation for the costs it had incurred in its unsuccessful attempts to discover documents and depose him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  On January 13, 1993, having received no payment from Carroll, the PAC moved to default Carroll pursuant to Fed.  R. Civ. P. 37(b) and (d).  The motion was based on Carroll's willful refusal to obey the district court's orders to produce documents and submit to a deposition as well as the order compelling Carroll to pay the $2000 sanction for his past misconduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 10, 1993, the district court held a hearing on the PAC's motion for a default judgment.  Despite Carroll's obstinacy, the court deferred ruling on the motion and gave Carroll one last chance.  The court ordered Carroll to appear for his deposition on March 15, 1993 and to produce the requested documents at his deposition.  In making this ruling, the court explained to Carroll that he was required to appear and answer questions in whatever capacity he thought he was acting with respects to the pension plans.  (Supp. App. pp. 255-60).  Carroll responded, \"I don't know what you mean by me[,]\" and repeatedly protested that he was not able to comply with discovery in his capacity as the administrator of Plan I because he had been sued as an individual.  The court specifically instructed Carroll to answer \"whatever question is put to you\" and to \"have with you all the documents that pertain to the pension plan.  It doesn't matter whether you are William Carroll, personally, William Carroll, trustee, William Carroll, plan administrator, you will appear with all the documents.\"  (Supp. App. pp. 260, 272).  When Carroll protested, \"I hear the words, but I don't understand the meaning,\" the court urged him to try, noting that, \"[i]f you don't succeed, there will be further sanctions against you Mr. Carroll.\"  (Supp. App. p. 273).  The court further ordered Carroll to issue a $2000 check to plaintiff's counsel without restrictions.  (Supp. App. p. 278).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 11, 1993, the district court issued a written order embodying its oral orders from the previous day's hearing.  Carroll failed to appear for his deposition and did not pay the $2000 sanction.  On March 17, 1993, the PAC filed a renewed motion to default Carroll and for further sanctions.  Carroll filed a response in which he indicated that he agreed that a default was \"the desired solution of the moment\" because he wanted to get this case before another court.  The court scheduled a hearing on the renewed motion to default Carroll for April 27, 1992.  In response to the hearing notice, Carroll filed another rambling and prolix document generally protesting his treatment in the district court while announcing that he would not be attending the hearing on the default motion.  On April 27, 1993, the district court defaulted Carroll under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 37.  The court specifically found that Carroll willfully and persistently refused to obey the court's orders, including the August 14, 1992 order to produce documents, the March 10-11, 1993 oral and written orders to appear for his deposition, and the January 5, 1993 sanction order.  (Supp. App. pp. 285-86).  The court also required plaintiff's counsel to prepare a proposed judgment.  On May 5, 1993, the district court entered a judgment against Carroll on counts I through V of the complaint.  The judgment declared that the PAC had the right to possession and control of the assets in the account(s) of PGA in Plan I, and ordered Carroll, in whatever capacity necessary, to forthwith direct the First National Bank of Boston (the trustee of Plan I) to transfer all assets in PGA's account(s) in Plan I to the Northern Trust Company, the trustee of Plan III.  The judgment also required Carroll to provide plaintiff's counsel with a full and complete accounting of the assets in PGA's account(s) in Plan I and to personally pay plaintiff's costs under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(g).  (Supp. App. pp. 288-89).  Carroll filed a timely notice of appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Federal Rule 37 empowers a district court to make such orders as 'are just' when a party fails to comply with a discovery order, placing the court's handling of such matters beyond appellate review when there has been no abuse of discretion.\"   Local Union No. 251 v. Town Line Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc., 511 F.2d 1198, 1199 (1st Cir. 1975).  On this record, we have no hesitation in concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in defaulting Carroll.  In view of Carroll's repeated violations of the court's orders to produce documents and submit to a deposition, not to mention his failure to pay the $2000 sanction, we think that the district court exhibited extraordinary patience.  The default judgment was wholly justified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Carroll argues that the orders compelling discovery were erroneous because they directed him to provide information in his capacity as the administrator of Plan I when he had only been sued in his individual capacity.  Carroll claims that this alleged technical defect in the summons and complaint disabled him from responding to the PAC's discovery efforts.  He contends that the default judgment sanctioned him for the conduct of a non-party i.e. William J. Carroll, Administrator of Plan I, and therefore is not \"just\" within the meaning of Fed.  R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, we refuse to indulge in such willful blindness.  Carroll concedes that he is the administrator of Plan I and the record discloses that he possesses numerous documents responsive to the PAC's request for production.  Carroll's feigned inability to comply is indicative of bad faith, which further justifies the default.   See Eisler v. Stritzler, 535 F.2d 148, 153 (1st Cir. 1976)(upholding default judgment where defendant acted in bad faith throughout litigation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carroll also assails the default judgment under ERISA, raising a host of arguments.  He claims that the amendment to Plan I which created Plan II is invalid, thus Plan II never acquired a right to PGA's assets.  Carroll further argues that ERISA does not recognize mergers of pension plans, therefore the merger of Plans II and III also is invalid and the PAC has no right to PGA's assets as a result of the merger, apart from the invalidity of Plan II.  Carroll also contends that the PAC lacks standing to sue because it is not a \"person\" and therefore cannot be a fiduciary under 29 U.S.C. Secs. 1002(9) and 21(A).  Each of these claims have been waived by Carroll's accession to the default.  \"[A]n entry of default against a defendant establishes the defendant's liability.\"   Goldman, Antonetti, Ferraiuo-Li, Axtmayer &amp; Hertell v. Medfit International, Inc., 982 F.2d 686, 693 (1st Cir. 1993)(citations omitted).  Insofar as these contentions attack the liability finding, they come too late.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carroll's remaining arguments are equally without merit, and largely unintelligible.  We particularly note that the district judge did not abuse her discretion in denying Carroll's multiple motions to disqualify her.  It is well established that \"[p]rior adverse rulings alone cannot, of course, be the basis for a motion to recuse.\"   Panzardi-Alvarez v. United States, 879 F.2d 975, 984 (1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1082 (1990).  Given Carroll's wholly unjustified refusal to comply with the court's orders, no appearance of bias arises from this record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Plan II is also known as the Sheraton Salaried and Hourly Retirement Plans and Trusts for Managed Hotels</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The complaint further alleged that TPF &amp; C made further demands on Carroll to transfer PGA's assets during the remainder of 1988.

In response, Carroll filed a notice withdrawing his motion for reconsideration with the district court.  We allowed this appeal to proceed and directed both parties to brief the jurisdictional issues.  Regrettably, neither party has done so.

The plaintiff is the Pension Administration Committee of the Sheraton Corporation Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees (\"the PAC\").  The defendant is William J. Carroll d/b/a Carroll Consulting Actuaries (Carroll).  Pursuant to Fed.  R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2), the district court entered a default judgment against Carroll for his failure to comply with multiple orders compelling discovery.  Carroll now appeals from the default judgment.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PAC commenced this action by filing a five-count complaint which stated claims for relief under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 et. seq., the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2201, federal common law, and state law.  The complaint alleged the following facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PGA Resort Ltd.  (PGA), a Florida limited partnership, owned the former Sheraton PGA Resort Hotel in West Palm Beach, Florida.  In 1980, PGA began providing retirement benefits for its salaried and hourly employees.  PGA provided those benefits by becoming a participating employer in the Pension Plan and Trust for Hotels and Motor Inns Associated With The Sheraton Corporation (Plan I).  Under Plan I, individual owners of hotels associated with the Sheraton Corporation (Sheraton) adopted as their pension plans the terms of two \"master\" documents a Pension Plan Agreement and a Pension Trust Agreement (the Plan Documents).  These documents provided that a participating employer could withdraw from Plan I and establish a separate qualified pension or retirement plan provided that the new plan provided equal or greater rights and benefits to the employees covered by Plan I.  Under Plan I, PGA and other participating employers made contributions to a common trust fund which was held by the Bank of Boston as trustee.  The Plan Documents further provided that, upon an employer's withdrawal from Plan I, the assets in the participating employer's account in Plan I shall be transferred to the trustee designated by the employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carroll is the administrator for Plan I. He has the duty to account separately for the Plan assets of each participating employer and exclusive control over the disposition of Plan I's assets.  The complaint alleged that as a result of the following events, Carroll continued improperly to exercise control over the assets in PGA's account in Plan I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, PGA decided to participate in a new pension plan (Plan II) that preserved the rights and benefits of all PGA employees covered by Plan I, in addition to providing other benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  PGA informed Carroll of its intention to withdraw from Plan I. Carroll informed PGA and its agent, the actuarial firm of Towers, Perrin, Forster &amp; Crosby (TPF &amp; C), that a new pension plan and trust approved by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was the only authorization he required to transfer PGA's assets to the trustee of the new pension plan.  PGA subsequently adopted Plan II and requested a ruling from the IRS that Plan II was a qualified pension plan under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 401(a).  The IRS issued such a ruling in 1988.  Thereafter, TPF &amp; C instructed Carroll to transfer PGA's assets in Plan I to the Shawmut Bank, the trustee for Plan II.  The complaint alleged that despite PGA's compliance with the requirements for transferring the assets set forth in Plan I and Carroll's own conditions, Carroll refused to transfer PGA's assets without justification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Effective January 1, 1989, PGA discontinued providing retirement benefits to its employees.  Pursuant to an agreement between PGA and Sheraton, the liabilities and assets of Plan II were merged into a third pension plan, the Sheraton Corporation Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees (Plan III).  The PAC is the administrator and a named fiduciary of Plan III.  See 29 U.S.C. Secs. 1102(16)(A), 1102(a).  The complaint alleged that at the time this merger took place, PGA's assets in Plan I were the lawful property of Plan II and thus should have been received by Plan III as a result of the merger.  However, Carroll improperly continued to refuse to transfer PGA's assets to Plan III despite multiple demands by PGA, its agents, and the PAC.  The complaint alleged that PGA's assets in Plan I (hereafter, \"the Assets\") have been the lawful property of Plan III since January 1, 1989 and that Carroll's improper retention of control over the Assets is in derogation of Plan III's right to possession and control.  The PAC commenced this action to compel Carroll to transfer the Assets to Plan III.  According to the complaint, Carroll's most recent accounting indicated that the Assets were worth at least $230,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two counts of the complaint alleged that Carroll's improper refusal to transfer the Assets constituted a breach of his fiduciary duty to act solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of Plan I in violation of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1104(a)(1), and a breach of his fiduciary duty to act in accordance with the documents and instruments governing Plan I in violation of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1104(a)(1)(D).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Carroll's refusal to transfer the Assets also was said to violate of the terms of Plan I. These violations were said to entitle the PAC to an order compelling Carroll to (1) direct the Bank of Boston, the trustee of Plan I, to transfer all assets in PGA's account in Plan I to the trustee for Plan III, Northern Trust Company, and, (2) provide the PAC with a final accounting of the assets in PGA's account in Plan I. The PAC claimed this relief under ERISA's civil enforcement provision, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(a)(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Count II sought a declaratory judgment that the PAC, not Carroll, was entitled to possession and control of the Assets in addition to the aforementioned equitable relief.  Counts four and five of the complaint stated common law claims for breach of fiduciary duty and conversion and claimed damages in an amount not less than the market value of the Assets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the course of the proceedings below, Carroll maintained that since the summons and complaint identified him as \"William J. Carroll d/b/a Carroll Consulting Actuaries,\" he had been sued in his individual capacity only, and therefore lacked the ability to respond to the complaint and the PAC's discovery requests in his capacity as the administrator of Plan I. Thus, the PAC filed a request for production of documents shortly after it filed its complaint.  That request sought all correspondence, notes and files relating to PGA, its pension plans, or the Assets, as well as all correspondence between Carroll and any other person or entity relating to Carroll's role as the administrator of Plan I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carroll initially did not file a response to this request for production of documents.  Instead, proceeding pro se, he filed an \"Objection to Complaint and Motion to Stay Proceedings.\"  This document alleged, inter alia, that the PAC lacked the standing to bring this action and that Carroll lacked the capacity to defend it since he had been sued only in his individual capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Carroll withdrew this motion before it was heard.  On June 5, 1992, an initial scheduling conference (ISC) was held before the district court.  After explaining to Carroll that the PAC was entitled to discover the documents it had requested, the district judge ordered Carroll to produce the requisite documents by June 26, 1992 and to submit to a deposition on August 10th and 11th, 1992.  A written order embodying these requirements was issued on June 10, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, 1992, Carroll filed a response to the PAC's request for production of documents.  For the most part, that response denied that Carroll possessed the requested documents in his individual capacity and expressly disavowed the capacity or authority to respond to the PAC's request as the administrator of Plan I.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  On July 2, 1992, the PAC filed a motion to compel production of documents and for sanctions.  The motion stated that Carroll had refused to produce documents based on his meritless attempt to distinguish documents he possessed in an individual capacity and documents he possessed in his capacity as administrator of Plan I.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  On August 14, 1992, the district court denied Carroll's motion for disqualification and allowed the PAC's motion to compel production of documents.  The court issued an order that required Carroll to produce all documents which he held in his individual or representative capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated August 20, 1992, plaintiff's counsel notified Carroll to produce the requisite documents by August 24th and to appear for his deposition on August 28th.  Once again, Carroll did not comply.  On August 31, 1992, the PAC filed a motion for sanctions based on Carroll's failure to comply with the district court's August 14, 1992 order to produce documents and on his subsequent failure to appear for his deposition on August 28th.  The PAC also filed a motion for summary judgment on August 31, 1992.  In support of this motion, the PAC filed multiple affidavits, including that of Kathy Bascik, Sheraton's Director of Employee Benefits.  Bascik averred that after Plans II and III merged, Plan III began paying claims submitted by the participants and beneficiaries of PGA's pension plans.  She further averred that Plan III would continue to pay all valid claims of participants and beneficiaries of PGA's pension plans, although Plan III had been deprived of the assets which correspond to these liabilities as a result of Carroll's refusal to transfer PGA's assets in Plan I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not rule on the PAC's motion for sanctions while its motion for summary judgment remained under advisement.  On November 3, 1992, the district court denied that motion on the ground that genuine issues of material fact remained about the validity of the amendment to Plan I and the validity of Plan II.  Thereafter, the PAC resumed its efforts to secure discovery from Carroll.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 18, 1992, the PAC noticed Carroll's deposition for January 5, 1993.  Anticipating that Carroll would not comply on the ground that he could not do so in his individual capacity, plaintiff's counsel subpoenaed Carroll for this deposition in his capacity as the administrator of Plan I. The subpoena also required Carroll to produce the previously requested documents by January 4, 1993.  The PAC also requested a ruling on its August 31, 1992 motion for sanctions.  On December 29, 1992, Carroll informed plaintiff's counsel that counsel was being engaged to represent Plan I and that he would be unable to comply with the subpoena for his deposition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 5, 1993, the district court allowed the PAC's motion for sanctions.  The court ordered Carroll to pay $2000 to the plaintiff forthwith as partial compensation for the costs it had incurred in its unsuccessful attempts to discover documents and depose him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  On January 13, 1993, having received no payment from Carroll, the PAC moved to default Carroll pursuant to Fed.  R. Civ. P. 37(b) and (d).  The motion was based on Carroll's willful refusal to obey the district court's orders to produce documents and submit to a deposition as well as the order compelling Carroll to pay the $2000 sanction for his past misconduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 10, 1993, the district court held a hearing on the PAC's motion for a default judgment.  Despite Carroll's obstinacy, the court deferred ruling on the motion and gave Carroll one last chance.  The court ordered Carroll to appear for his deposition on March 15, 1993 and to produce the requested documents at his deposition.  In making this ruling, the court explained to Carroll that he was required to appear and answer questions in whatever capacity he thought he was acting with respects to the pension plans.  (Supp. App. pp. 255-60).  Carroll responded, \"I don't know what you mean by me[,]\" and repeatedly protested that he was not able to comply with discovery in his capacity as the administrator of Plan I because he had been sued as an individual.  The court specifically instructed Carroll to answer \"whatever question is put to you\" and to \"have with you all the documents that pertain to the pension plan.  It doesn't matter whether you are William Carroll, personally, William Carroll, trustee, William Carroll, plan administrator, you will appear with all the documents.\"  (Supp. App. pp. 260, 272).  When Carroll protested, \"I hear the words, but I don't understand the meaning,\" the court urged him to try, noting that, \"[i]f you don't succeed, there will be further sanctions against you Mr. Carroll.\"  (Supp. App. p. 273).  The court further ordered Carroll to issue a $2000 check to plaintiff's counsel without restrictions.  (Supp. App. p. 278).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 11, 1993, the district court issued a written order embodying its oral orders from the previous day's hearing.  Carroll failed to appear for his deposition and did not pay the $2000 sanction.  On March 17, 1993, the PAC filed a renewed motion to default Carroll and for further sanctions.  Carroll filed a response in which he indicated that he agreed that a default was \"the desired solution of the moment\" because he wanted to get this case before another court.  The court scheduled a hearing on the renewed motion to default Carroll for April 27, 1992.  In response to the hearing notice, Carroll filed another rambling and prolix document generally protesting his treatment in the district court while announcing that he would not be attending the hearing on the default motion.  On April 27, 1993, the district court defaulted Carroll under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 37.  The court specifically found that Carroll willfully and persistently refused to obey the court's orders, including the August 14, 1992 order to produce documents, the March 10-11, 1993 oral and written orders to appear for his deposition, and the January 5, 1993 sanction order.  (Supp. App. pp. 285-86).  The court also required plaintiff's counsel to prepare a proposed judgment.  On May 5, 1993, the district court entered a judgment against Carroll on counts I through V of the complaint.  The judgment declared that the PAC had the right to possession and control of the assets in the account(s) of PGA in Plan I, and ordered Carroll, in whatever capacity necessary, to forthwith direct the First National Bank of Boston (the trustee of Plan I) to transfer all assets in PGA's account(s) in Plan I to the Northern Trust Company, the trustee of Plan III.  The judgment also required Carroll to provide plaintiff's counsel with a full and complete accounting of the assets in PGA's account(s) in Plan I and to personally pay plaintiff's costs under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132(g).  (Supp. App. pp. 288-89).  Carroll filed a timely notice of appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Federal Rule 37 empowers a district court to make such orders as 'are just' when a party fails to comply with a discovery order, placing the court's handling of such matters beyond appellate review when there has been no abuse of discretion.\"   Local Union No. 251 v. Town Line Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"325699\"><a href=\"/opinion/325699/local-union-no-251-affiliated-with-international-brotherhood-of-teamsters/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></a></span>, 1199 (1st Cir. 1975).  On this record, we have no hesitation in concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in defaulting Carroll.  In view of Carroll's repeated violations of the court's orders to produce documents and submit to a deposition, not to mention his failure to pay the $2000 sanction, we think that the district court exhibited extraordinary patience.  The default judgment was wholly justified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Carroll argues that the orders compelling discovery were erroneous because they directed him to provide information in his capacity as the administrator of Plan I when he had only been sued in his individual capacity.  Carroll claims that this alleged technical defect in the summons and complaint disabled him from responding to the PAC's discovery efforts.  He contends that the default judgment sanctioned him for the conduct of a non-party i.e. William J. Carroll, Administrator of Plan I, and therefore is not \"just\" within the meaning of Fed.  R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, we refuse to indulge in such willful blindness.  Carroll concedes that he is the administrator of Plan I and the record discloses that he possesses numerous documents responsive to the PAC's request for production.  Carroll's feigned inability to comply is indicative of bad faith, which further justifies the default.   See Eisler v. Stritzler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"335265\"><a href=\"/opinion/335265/eugene-eisler-and-elizabeth-eisler-v-nathan-stritzler/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 153 (1st Cir. 1976)(upholding default judgment where defendant acted in bad faith throughout litigation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carroll also assails the default judgment under ERISA, raising a host of arguments.  He claims that the amendment to Plan I which created Plan II is invalid, thus Plan II never acquired a right to PGA's assets.  Carroll further argues that ERISA does not recognize mergers of pension plans, therefore the merger of Plans II and III also is invalid and the PAC has no right to PGA's assets as a result of the merger, apart from the invalidity of Plan II.  Carroll also contends that the PAC lacks standing to sue because it is not a \"person\" and therefore cannot be a fiduciary under 29 U.S.C. Secs. 1002(9) and 21(A).  Each of these claims have been waived by Carroll's accession to the default.  \"[A]n entry of default against a defendant establishes the defendant's liability.\"   Goldman, Antonetti, Ferraiuo-Li, Axtmayer &amp; Hertell v. Medfit International, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597417\"><a href=\"/opinion/597417/goldman-antonetti-ferraiuoli-axtmayer-hertell-a-partnership-v-medfit/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span>, 693 (1st Cir. 1993)(citations omitted).  Insofar as these contentions attack the liability finding, they come too late.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carroll's remaining arguments are equally without merit, and largely unintelligible.  We particularly note that the district judge did not abuse her discretion in denying Carroll's multiple motions to disqualify her.  It is well established that \"[p]rior adverse rulings alone cannot, of course, be the basis for a motion to recuse.\"   Panzardi-Alvarez v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526438\"><a href=\"/opinion/526438/jose-e-panzardi-alvarez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span>, 984 (1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></span> (1990).  Given Carroll's wholly unjustified refusal to comply with the court's orders, no appearance of bias arises from this record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Plan II is also known as the Sheraton Salaried and Hourly Retirement Plans and Trusts for Managed Hotels</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The complaint further alleged that TPF &amp; C made further demands on Carroll to transfer PGA's assets during the remainder of 1988.

While the check was made payable to the PAC, it included a list of conditions seemingly designed to render it non-negotiable.  For example, the check indicated that it was good for 30 days only.  An accompanying document provided that the PAC's deposit of the check would constitute an admission against its interest.  Thus, plaintiff's counsel was unable to use this check</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Carroll filed a motion for reconsideration before he filed his notice of appeal.  The motion did not object to the entry of the default per se.  Rather, Carroll sought to revise the substance of the judgment.  On June 11, 1993, this court ordered Carroll to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction given the outstanding motion for reconsideration.  In response, Carroll filed a notice withdrawing his motion for reconsideration with the district court.  We allowed this appeal to proceed and directed both parties to brief the jurisdictional issues.  Regrettably, neither party has done so.  As we conclude that Carroll is not entitled to relief on the merits, we need not address the jurisdictional issues.   See Norton v.
