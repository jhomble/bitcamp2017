Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico\n                             \n\nbuys marine fuel  oil in San  Juan and resells  that oil  to\n\nocean-going  liners at berth in San Juan Harbor.  It brought\n\nthis antitrust  action against its local  fuel oil supplier,\n\nCaribbean Petroleum Corporation  (\"CAPECO\"), and two of  its\n\ncompetitors,   both  of  whom   CAPECO  supplies.    Coastal\n\nbasically claims that ever  since October 1991, when Coastal\n\nentered the  San Juan  market, CAPECO has  charged Coastal's\n\ntwo competitors prices that are significantly lower than the\n\nprices  it   charges  Coastal.     This   unjustified  price\n\ndifference, says Coastal, violates the  Robinson-Patman Act,\n\n15 U.S.C.   13, and the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.   1.  Coastal\n\nasked the  district court to enter  a preliminary injunction\n\n\"requiring CAPECO  to provide fuel  oil to Coastal  on terms\n\nand conditions no less  favorable than those made available\"\n\nto Coastal's competitors.  The district court decided not to\n\nenter the  injunction.   Coastal  appeals.   We  affirm  the\n\ndecision.\n\n          In  deciding  whether   to  issue  a   preliminary\n\ninjunction, a district court  must ask whether the plaintiff\n\nis likely  to succeed on  the merits, whether  the plaintiff\n\nwill otherwise suffer irreparable harm, whether the benefits\n\nof an injunction will, on balance, outweigh the burdens, and\n\nwhether   an  injunction  is  consistent  with  the  \"public\n\ninterest.\"  Planned Parenthood  League v. Bellotti, 641 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1006, 1009 (1st Cir. 1981);  Boston Celtics Ltd.

This  court\n       \n\nwill normally give the district court considerable leeway in\n\nmaking  its decision, at least where,  as here, the decision\n\nrests  upon an  exercise of  judgment and  a record  that is\n\nincomplete.   Indeed, normally we will  reverse the district\n\ncourt's decision  on such matters  only if we  are convinced\n\nthat it \"abused its discretion\" or committed a \"clear error\"\n\nof fact or related  law.  See, e.g., Massachusetts  Ass'n of\n                                                            \n\nOlder Americans  v. Sharp,  700 F.2d  749, 751-52  (1st Cir.\n                         \n\n1983).  We can find no such error in the present case.\n\n          For one thing, Coastal's \"likelihood of success on\n\nthe  merits,\"  is, at  best, uncertain.    On the  one hand,\n\nCoastal   presented   witnesses  who   testified   to  facts\n\nindicating significant price differences.  They said that:\n\n          (1) After Coastal entered the San Juan market, the\n          resale prices charged  by its competitors  (to the\n          ships) dropped by nearly $1 per barrel;\n\n          (2) Coastal's competitors' resale prices  were at,\n          or below, the prices CAPECO charged Coastal;\n\n          (3)  Coastal,  though  it  had  expected  to  earn\n          profits,  lost $1.3  million during its  first ten\n          months of operations;\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n          (4)  CAPECO (perhaps by mistake) once sent Coastal\n          an  invoice showing  a price  of $1.45  per barrel\n          less than the price CAPECO charged Coastal;\n              \n\n          (5) Two CAPECO  executives told Coastal executives\n          that  CAPECO  was  charging Coastal's  competitors\n          lower prices than CAPECO charged Coastal.\n\n          On  the  other hand,  the  record  is not  at  all\n\nspecific about the prices charged.  Nowhere does  it contain\n\nfigures,  or even  estimates,  of the  actual prices  either\n\nCoastal, or Coastal's competitors paid for fuel oil.  At the\n\nsame time, it contains other evidence that militates against\n\nan eventual finding of unlawful behavior.  Cross-examination\n\nof Coastal's witnesses revealed  that, when CAPECO officials\n\ntold  them  CAPECO charged  Coastal's competitors  less, the\n\nofficials  immediately  added  that  the  price  differences\n\nreflected  \"different contract\"  terms.   The  evidence also\n                                      \n\nshows  that  CAPECO's   per  barrel  prices   diminished  as\n\ncustomers ordered in  greater volumes --  a kind of  volume-\n\nrelated pricing apparently commonplace  in the oil industry.\n\nCoastal apparently  paid \"spot sales\" prices for oil, and it\n\nmay have bought  in somewhat lower  volumes.  The  Robinson-\n\nPatman   Act   does   not   prohibit   volume-related  price\n\ndifferences that  reflect genuine cost differences.   See 15\n                                                         \n\nU.S.C.    13(a); FTC  v. Morton  Salt Co., 334  U.S. 37,  48\n                                         \n\n(1948); Frederick  M. Rowe,  Price Discrimination Under  the\n                                                            \n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nRobinson-Patman  Act, ch. 10 at 265-321 (1962).  Nor does it\n                    \n\nprohibit price  differences between spot sales and long-term\n\ncontract  sales that  reflect  different market  conditions.\n\nSee Texas Gulf  Sulphur Co. v. J.  R. Simplot Co., 418  F.2d\n                                                 \n\n793, 806-08 (9th  Cir. 1969); Rowe, supra,    4.2 at 50, ch.\n                                         \n\n11 at 322-29.\n\n          It  may  well be  that,  at  trial, Coastal  would\n\nproduce more specific  price information, CAPECO  would fail\n\nto  demonstrate  \"cost  justification,\" and,  the  potential\n\ncost,  or market,  related  differences  between \"spot\"  and\n\n\"contract\" sales would evaporate. But, the opposite may also\n\nprove true.  At this stage, a court could reasonably want to\n\nsee  more evidence  -- insisting that  the plaintiff  make a\n\nsomewhat  stronger,  more  specific,  showing  of  a  likely\n\nviolation of law, including a probability of overcoming what\n\nthe  evidence  now shows  as  plausible  defenses --  before\n\nfinding  a likelihood of  success on the  merits. See, e.g.,\n                                                           \n\nAtari  Games Corp.  v. Nintendo  of America, Inc.,  975 F.2d\n                                                 \n\n832, 837  (Fed. Cir. 1992) (plaintiff  must show \"likelihood\n\nthat  it will overcome . . . defense\"); New England Braiding\n                                                            \n\nCo.  v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 970 F.2d 878, 882-83 (Fed. Cir.\n                           \n\n1992) (same).  But cf. Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc.  v.\n                                                        \n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\nScoreboard  Posters, Inc.,  600  F.2d 1184,  1188 (5th  Cir.\n                        \n\n1979).\n\n          For another thing, the  district court did not err\n\nin finding that Coastal  would not suffer \"irreparable harm\"\n\nthat a later damage award could not avoid.  On the one hand,\n\nCoastal presented two witnesses  who testified to such harm.\n\nThese Coastal executives said, for example, that:\n\n          (1) \"[F]uel from CAPECO  is the only practical way\n          to purchase fuel in the harbor.\"\n\n          (2)  \"[I]t's absolutely  imperative that  you have\n          the  supply from  CAPECO  refinery  it's the  only\n          locally produced product from San Juan harbor, and\n          without that access on  equal basis to that supply\n          you cannot compete in San Juan harbor.\"\n\n          (3) \"[W]e are sustaining  losses in here, . .  . I\n          feel it's  damaging our trade mark,  and our brand\n          and  our  reputation, and  I  don't  think we  can\n          continue doing business like this.\" \n\n          (4) Withdrawal from  San Juan Harbor  \"would serve\n          irreparable damage upon Coastal's name  which goes\n          back to 1915 in the form of serving [marine] . . .\n          fuel in 20 other ports that we supply. . . .\"\n\n          On the other hand, cross-examination revealed that\n\nCoastal is  a subsidiary of a large  firm (of the same name)\n\nthat sells marine  fuel in 20 other ports; that, on at least\n\nthree  occasions, Coastal  has imported  marine fuel  to San\n\nJuan  (for resale)  from  its parent  company's refinery  in\n\nAruba;  that CAPECO  stored at  least some of  this imported\n\nfuel oil for Coastal  in CAPECO's San Juan  facilities; that\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nCoastal also, on at  least one occasion, purchased  fuel oil\n\nfrom  Sun Oil, apparently in Puerto Rico; and that Coastal's\n\nwitnesses (despite their assurances that importation was not\n\npossible) were not familiar with the relevant prices.  \n\n          Given  this  record,  we  cannot  second-guess the\n\ndistrict court's judgment that  Coastal had shown neither an\n\ninability to  survive (during the course  of the litigation)\n\non imported oil, nor  a potential loss of \"goodwill\"  that a\n\nlater damage award could not readily compensate.  Appellants\n\npresently point out  that the  courts possess  the power  to\n\nissue  a business-preserving  injunction, at  least where  a\n\nfuture damage  remedy may prove inadequate.   Compare, e.g.,\n                                                          \n\nSemmes Motors, Inc. v.  Ford Motor Co., 429 F.2d  1197, 1205\n                                      \n\n(2d Cir. 1970) (injunction  proper to prevent termination of\n\nbusiness) and Jacobson &amp; Co. v. Armstrong Cork Co., 548 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n438,  444-45 (2d  Cir. 1977)  (injunction proper  to prevent\n\nloss of customers) with Kenworth  of Boston, Inc. v.  Paccar\n                                                            \n\nFinancial  Corp., 735 F.2d 622, 625 (1st Cir. 1984) (no real\n                \n\nthreat of business closure)  and Goldie's Bookstore, Inc. v.\n                                                         \n\nSuperior  Court of California,  739 F.2d 466,  472 (9th Cir.\n                             \n\n1984) (insufficient  evidence of \"goodwill\" loss).   But, we\n\nalso agree with the district court that plaintiff failed  to\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\ndemonstrate   the  existence  of  circumstances  that  would\n\nrequire the exercise of that power in this case. \n\n          The upshot is a preliminary injunction record that\n\ntends  to  show price  differences,  that  is unclear  about\n\namounts,   that  suggests   the  existence   of  significant\n\ndefenses, and that is not particularly convincing in respect\n\nto  \"irreparable   harm.\"    Were   \"price  differences\"  an\n\nunmitigated  evil,  the case  for  a preliminary  injunction\n\nwould be stronger.  But, as we have previously stated, those\n\nwho wrote  the Robinson-Patman  Act had  pro-competitive (as\n                                                        \n\nwell as  pro-competitor) objectives in mind.   See Monahan's\n                                                            \n\nMarine Inc. v. Boston  Whaler, Inc., 866 F.2d 525,  529 (1st\n                                   \n\nCir.  1989).    And,  price  differences,  based  upon  cost\n\nsavings, will sometimes have  a pro-competitive impact.  Cf.\n                                                            \n\nid.  (recognizing  anti-competitive  dangers  of  forbidding\n   \n\nselective,  but  non-predatory,  price cutting).    Thus, we\n\nunderstand  the  district  court's   hesitancy  to  issue  a\n\npreliminary injunction, not only  without a stronger showing\n\nof \"irreparable  harm,\" but also without  knowing more about\n\nthe  facts of  the  case.   Its decision,  in  our view,  is\n\nlawful.\n\n          We add  two  further  points.    First,  Coastal's\n\ncomplaint also asserts that CAPECO and Coastal's competitors\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nviolated  the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.   1.  Coastal's request\n\nfor   a  preliminary  injunction,   however,  rested  almost\n\nentirely upon its Robinson-Patman  Act claim.  And, Coastal,\n\non  this  appeal,  does not  contend  that  it  has made  an\n\nevidentiary  showing  sufficient  to  warrant  a preliminary\n\ninjunction on the Sherman Act claim.  Cf.  Monahan's Marine,\n                                                           \n\n866 F.2d at 529  (\"evidence of a violation of  the Robinson-\n\nPatman  Act, showing  injury only  to competitors,  does not\n\nautomatically show a violation of the Sherman Act as well\").\n\n          Second, all three defendants (CAPECO and Coastal's\n\ntwo  competitors)  asked  the   district  court  to  dismiss\n\nCoastal's  Robinson-Patman  Act claims  on  the  ground that\n\nCoastal could  not show  that  either a  high-price sale  to\n\nCoastal, or a low-price sale to a competitor, took place \"in\n\n[interstate] commerce.\"  15 U.S.C.   13(a); Standard Oil Co.\n                                                            \n\nv.

It brought\n\nthis antitrust  action against its local  fuel oil supplier,\n\nCaribbean Petroleum Corporation  (\"CAPECO\"), and two of  its\n\ncompetitors,   both  of  whom   CAPECO  supplies.    Coastal\n\nbasically claims that ever  since October 1991, when Coastal\n\nentered the  San Juan  market, CAPECO has  charged Coastal's\n\ntwo competitors prices that are significantly lower than the\n\nprices  it   charges  Coastal.     This   unjustified  price\n\ndifference, says Coastal, violates the  Robinson-Patman Act,\n\n15 U.S.C.   13, and the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.   1.  Coastal\n\nasked the  district court to enter  a preliminary injunction\n\n\"requiring CAPECO  to provide fuel  oil to Coastal  on terms\n\nand conditions no less  favorable than those made available\"\n\nto Coastal's competitors.  The district court decided not to\n\nenter the  injunction.   Coastal  appeals.   We  affirm  the\n\ndecision.\n\n          In  deciding  whether   to  issue  a   preliminary\n\ninjunction, a district court  must ask whether the plaintiff\n\nis likely  to succeed on  the merits, whether  the plaintiff\n\nwill otherwise suffer irreparable harm, whether the benefits\n\nof an injunction will, on balance, outweigh the burdens, and\n\nwhether   an  injunction  is  consistent  with  the  \"public\n\ninterest.\"  Planned Parenthood  League v.

We can find no such error in the present case.\n\n          For one thing, Coastal's \"likelihood of success on\n\nthe  merits,\"  is, at  best, uncertain.    On the  one hand,\n\nCoastal   presented   witnesses  who   testified   to  facts\n\nindicating significant price differences.  They said that:\n\n          (1) After Coastal entered the San Juan market, the\n          resale prices charged  by its competitors  (to the\n          ships) dropped by nearly $1 per barrel;\n\n          (2) Coastal's competitors' resale prices  were at,\n          or below, the prices CAPECO charged Coastal;\n\n          (3)  Coastal,  though  it  had  expected  to  earn\n          profits,  lost $1.3  million during its  first ten\n          months of operations;\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n          (4)  CAPECO (perhaps by mistake) once sent Coastal\n          an  invoice showing  a price  of $1.45  per barrel\n          less than the price CAPECO charged Coastal;\n              \n\n          (5) Two CAPECO  executives told Coastal executives\n          that  CAPECO  was  charging Coastal's  competitors\n          lower prices than CAPECO charged Coastal.\n\n          On  the  other hand,  the  record  is not  at  all\n\nspecific about the prices charged.  Nowhere does  it contain\n\nfigures,  or even  estimates,  of the  actual prices  either\n\nCoastal, or Coastal's competitors paid for fuel oil.  At the\n\nsame time, it contains other evidence that militates against\n\nan eventual finding of unlawful behavior.  Cross-examination\n\nof Coastal's witnesses revealed  that, when CAPECO officials\n\ntold  them  CAPECO charged  Coastal's competitors  less, the\n\nofficials  immediately  added  that  the  price  differences\n\nreflected  \"different contract\"  terms.   The  evidence also\n                                      \n\nshows  that  CAPECO's   per  barrel  prices   diminished  as\n\ncustomers ordered in  greater volumes --  a kind of  volume-\n\nrelated pricing apparently commonplace  in the oil industry.\n\nCoastal apparently  paid \"spot sales\" prices for oil, and it\n\nmay have bought  in somewhat lower  volumes.  The  Robinson-\n\nPatman   Act   does   not   prohibit   volume-related  price\n\ndifferences that  reflect genuine cost differences.

On the one hand,\n\nCoastal presented two witnesses  who testified to such harm.\n\nThese Coastal executives said, for example, that:\n\n          (1) \"[F]uel from CAPECO  is the only practical way\n          to purchase fuel in the harbor.\"\n\n          (2)  \"[I]t's absolutely  imperative that  you have\n          the  supply from  CAPECO  refinery  it's the  only\n          locally produced product from San Juan harbor, and\n          without that access on  equal basis to that supply\n          you cannot compete in San Juan harbor.\"\n\n          (3) \"[W]e are sustaining  losses in here, . .  .

Thus, we\n\nunderstand  the  district  court's   hesitancy  to  issue  a\n\npreliminary injunction, not only  without a stronger showing\n\nof \"irreparable  harm,\" but also without  knowing more about\n\nthe  facts of  the  case.   Its decision,  in  our view,  is\n\nlawful.\n\n          We add  two  further  points.    First,  Coastal's\n\ncomplaint also asserts that CAPECO and Coastal's competitors\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nviolated  the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.   1.  Coastal's request\n\nfor   a  preliminary  injunction,   however,  rested  almost\n\nentirely upon its Robinson-Patman  Act claim.  And, Coastal,\n\non  this  appeal,  does not  contend  that  it  has made  an\n\nevidentiary  showing  sufficient  to  warrant  a preliminary\n\ninjunction on the Sherman Act claim.  Cf.  Monahan's Marine,\n                                                           \n\n866 F.2d at 529  (\"evidence of a violation of  the Robinson-\n\nPatman  Act, showing  injury only  to competitors,  does not\n\nautomatically show a violation of the Sherman Act as well\").\n\n          Second, all three defendants (CAPECO and Coastal's\n\ntwo  competitors)  asked  the   district  court  to  dismiss\n\nCoastal's  Robinson-Patman  Act claims  on  the  ground that\n\nCoastal could  not show  that  either a  high-price sale  to\n\nCoastal, or a low-price sale to a competitor, took place \"in\n\n[interstate] commerce.\"  15 U.S.C.   13(a); Standard Oil Co.\n                                                            \n\nv.
