Appellant was  convicted of\n                                  \n\nconspiracy  to  possess  with  intent to  distribute  heroin  and\n\npossession  with intent to distribute heroin,  in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C.     841(a)(1)  and  (b)(1)(c) and  21  U.S.C.    846.   He\n\nappeals  on  two  grounds:  first, that  there  was  insufficient\n\nevidence  of conspiracy  to support  his conviction;  and second,\n\nthat  the  district court  erred in  calculating his  sentence by\n\nunderestimating  the quantity  of  heroin appellant  had for  his\n\npersonal use.  We conclude that neither claim succeeds.\n\n     Sufficiency  of the evidence.  We shall, of course, take the\n                                 \n\nevidence and  reasonable inferences  therefrom in the  light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict.  United States v. Moran, 984 F.2d 1299,\n                                                 \n\n1300 (1st Cir. 1993).  And we shall, without narrating the entire\n\nseries of events leading to this prosecution,  allude to evidence\n\nonly insofar as the sufficiency issue requires.  \n\n     Appellant,  who  bought  heroin from  Wilfredo  Figueroa,  a\n\nLawrence,  Massachusetts  supplier,  and  sold  to  a  number  of\n\ncustomers  in Maine, argues that the evidence proves only that he\n\nwas a mere customer of Figueroa.   He makes the following points:\n\nothers  bought  in  larger  quantities  from  the  supplier;  the\n\nsupplier  knew that  appellant,  who  customarily  consumed  some\n\nheroin at the  time of purchase, had  a serious addiction to  the\n\ndrug; the supplier never  requested appellant to sell for  him or\n\ndiscussed distribution  with him or  extended any credit  to him;\n\nand no drug  distribution paraphernalia (such  as scales or  drug\n\nledgers) were found that could be attributed to appellant.\n\n     The contrary evidence, however, was cumulatively impressive.\n\nThis  included:  the  continuity   and  duration  of  appellant's\n\ndealings with Figueroa (at least five trips and fifty bags a week\n\nfor ten  weeks); appellant's  actual knowledge  that some of  the\n\nheroin he bought from Figueroa was supplied by Soto, and inferred\n\nknowledge of a third  source of the heroin bought  from Figueroa;\n\nsales on a fairly steady basis to several identified customers in\n\nMaine (Babbitt, Poland, Kierstead), as well as some customers not\n\nidentified but  whose existence could be  inferred; conversations\n\nin  which  appellant  revealed  to  Figueroa  the  prices  he was\n\ncharging Maine buyers, apologized to Soto for \"the people here in\n\nMaine\" who preferred another product to his, and in which he told\n\nof future plans to sell heroin in Maine; the quantities purchased\n\nby appellant, which were significantly in excess  of any estimate\n\nof  appellant's own  consumption;  and, finally,  the fact  that,\n\nalthough  appellant was  without income  and living  on workman's\n\ncompensation at  the time, some  $500 in  cash was  found in  his\n\nbedroom  when he was arrested.   This was  sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport both a jury determination that appellant had joined  with\n\nothers  in an agreement to distribute heroin and that he intended\n\nto commit the substantive offense.\n\n     Calculation of  drug quantity  and base  offense level.   In\n                                                           \n\ndetermining   appellant's  sentence,   the  judge   accepted  the\n\nconservative estimates of the total quantities of heroin involved\n\nset  forth in  the  Presentence Investigation  Report (PSR),  and\n\narrived at  a total figure of  175.4 grams.  Based  on an average\n\n                               -3-\n\nconsumption of 25 bags per week, and applying appropriate weights\n\nfor  the different  time periods  involved, the  judge calculated\n\nappellant's total  consumption at 60.25 grams.   Subtracting this\n\nfrom  175.4 still left a net quantity of slightly over 115 grams.\n\nAccordingly, the  judge concluded that, even  taking into account\n\nappellant's  personal  heroin   consumption,  the  relevant  drug\n\nquantity  would be  still  be  in excess  of  100 grams.    Thus,\n\nregardless  of  whether  or   not  the  district  judge  excluded\n\nappellant's  personal  heroin   consumption  in  determining  the\n\nrelevant  drug quantity,  his base  offense level  under U.S.S.G.\n\n2D1.1(10) would be 26.  \n\n     Appellant now claims that the evidence was that  he consumed\n\nan average of five  to six bags a day,  or 35 to 42 bags  a week.\n\nCumulating these  quantities at  appropriate weights per  bag, he\n\narrives  at a  personal use  figure of  84.35 grams,  which, when\n\ndeducted from the total  quantity, would produce a net  figure of\n\n91.05 grams, and a base offense level of 24.\n\n     Even  if,  as  appellant  suggests,  the  trial  court  were\n\nrequired  to exclude  the  quantity  of  drugs he  possessed  for\n\npersonal  use in  calculating his  base offense  level under  the\n\nSentencing Guidelines, see, e.g., United States v. Kipp,  10 F.3d\n                                                       \n\n1463, 1465-66 (9th  Cir. 1993), this  claim would  fail.  On  the\n\nmerits, there is sufficient evidence on the record from which the\n\ntrial judge properly could conclude that appellant's personal use\n\nwas,  on average, 25  bags per week, and  therefore, in excess of\n\n100  grams of heroin were  involved in the  offense conduct.  And\n\n                               -4-\n\nwholly  apart from the  merits of the  claim, this issue  has not\n\nbeen preserved for review.\n\n     To  begin,   appellant's  testimony  at  trial   as  to  his\n\nconsumption  was something less than  certain.  He testified that\n\nafter getting out  of a treatment program in October  8, 1991, he\n\nfelt \"pretty good,\"  but that  by the beginning  of November,  he\n\n\"ended  up using again.\"   At this  time, he bought  one bag at a\n\ntime,  and got high  once every four  or five days,  and then, by\n\nmid-November,  three or four times every week.  He also testified\n\nthat at  the time of his  arrest in August 1992,  \"maybe\" he used\n\nfive bags a day.  \n\n     In  addition,  the  evidence  showed  that  appellant bought\n\nfluctuating  amounts of  heroin over  time, and  that  during the\n\ncourse of the conspiracy,  he spent two separate periods  of time\n\nin a substance abuse treatment program, in an effort to treat his\n\nheroin  addiction.    This  evidence  suggests  that  appellant's\n\npersonal  consumption likely  could have  varied relative  to the\n\namount  of heroin  available  to  him,  and  to  his  efforts  at\n\nrehabilitation.   Finally,  the PSR stated  that \"[p]rior  to his\n\narrest, the defendant reports that his habit involved using up to\n\n20 bags of heroin a  week.\"  Based on  all of this evidence,  the\n\ndistrict judge fairly could  conclude that an average of  25 bags\n\nper week  was representative  of appellant's  average consumption\n\nover time.\n\n     In any event, appellant has waived this claim.  He raised no\n\nobjection to the PSR's estimate that he  had \"up to\" a 20 bag per\n\n                               -5-\n\nweek habit.   Even  more  important, at  the sentencing  hearing,\n\nappellant  made no  suggestion that  the judge  had erred  in his\n\ncalculations as to appellant's  personal consumption -- a subject\n\nthat the judge  himself had  introduced.  We  note, in  addition,\n\nthat at  oral argument  before us, appellant's  counsel contended\n\nthat anyone with a habit requiring  five bags a day could not get\n\nby  on 25 bags a  week because he could not  \"take off two days a\n\nweek.\"   But  at the  sentencing  proceeding, trial  counsel  for\n\nappellant, in an effort to  minimize the total quantity involved,\n\nargued  that when  appellant \"couldn't  make the  five bag  a day\n\nhabit  which  his cross-examination  in  trial  showed he  simply\n\nstayed home and suffered.\"  The judge was obviously committing no\n\nerror, clear or otherwise, in harboring the same assumption.\n\n     Finally, at  the conclusion  of the sentencing  hearing, the\n\njudge asked  for any corrections.   Counsel for  both prosecution\n\nand defense expressed themselves as satisfied.\n\n     We  conclude by observing that no injustice has been done in\n\nthis case.   The  court, by  accepting conservative  estimates of\n\ntotal quantities  involved, which were  substantially below those\n\njustified  by  some  of the  testimony,  has  been  most fair  to\n\nappellant.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                               -6-\n",

This included:  the continuity and duration of appellant's dealings with Figueroa (at least five trips and fifty bags a week for ten weeks);  appellant's actual knowledge that some of the heroin he bought from Figueroa was supplied by Soto, and inferred knowledge of a third source of the heroin bought from Figueroa;  sales on a fairly steady basis to several identified customers in Maine (Babbitt, Poland, Kierstead), as well as some customers not identified but whose existence could be inferred;  conversations in which appellant revealed to Figueroa the prices he was charging Maine buyers, apologized to Soto for \"the people here in Maine\" who preferred another product to his, and in which he told of future plans to sell heroin in Maine;  the quantities purchased by appellant, which were significantly in excess of any estimate of appellant's own consumption;  and, finally, the fact that, although appellant was without income and living on workman's compensation at the time, some $500 in cash was found in his bedroom when he was arrested.

In determining appellant's sentence, the judge accepted the conservative estimates of the total quantities of heroin involved set forth in the Presentence Investigation Report (PSR), and arrived at a total figure of 175.4 grams.  Based on an average consumption of 25 bags per week, and applying appropriate weights for the different time periods involved, the judge calculated appellant's total consumption at 60.25 grams.  Subtracting this from 175.4 still left a net quantity of slightly over 115 grams.  Accordingly, the judge concluded that, even taking into account appellant's personal heroin consumption, the relevant drug quantity would be still be in excess of 100 grams.  Thus, regardless of whether or not the district judge excluded appellant's personal heroin consumption in determining the relevant drug quantity, his base offense level under U.S.S.G. 2D1.1(10) would be 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant now claims that the evidence was that he consumed an average of five to six bags a day, or 35 to 42 bags a week.  Cumulating these quantities at appropriate weights per bag, he arrives at a personal use figure of 84.35 grams, which, when deducted from the total quantity, would produce a net figure of 91.05 grams, and a base offense level of 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if, as appellant suggests, the trial court were required to exclude the quantity of drugs he possessed for personal use in calculating his base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines,  see, e.g., United States v.

Secs. 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(c) and 21 U.S.C. Sec. 846.  He appeals on two grounds:  first, that there was insufficient evidence of conspiracy to support his conviction;  and second, that the district court erred in calculating his sentence by underestimating the quantity of heroin appellant had for his personal use.  We conclude that neither claim succeeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sufficiency of the evidence.  We shall, of course, take the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict.   United States v. Moran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599257\"><a href=\"/opinion/599257/united-states-v-george-a-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1300 (1st Cir. 1993).  And we shall, without narrating the entire series of events leading to this prosecution, allude to evidence only insofar as the sufficiency issue requires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant, who bought heroin from Wilfredo Figueroa, a Lawrence, Massachusetts supplier, and sold to a number of customers in Maine, argues that the evidence proves only that he was a mere customer of Figueroa.  He makes the following points:  others bought in larger quantities from the supplier;  the supplier knew that appellant, who customarily consumed some heroin at the time of purchase, had a serious addiction to the drug;  the supplier never requested appellant to sell for him or discussed distribution with him or extended any credit to him;  and no drug distribution paraphernalia (such as scales or drug ledgers) were found that could be attributed to appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contrary evidence, however, was cumulatively impressive.  This included:  the continuity and duration of appellant's dealings with Figueroa (at least five trips and fifty bags a week for ten weeks);  appellant's actual knowledge that some of the heroin he bought from Figueroa was supplied by Soto, and inferred knowledge of a third source of the heroin bought from Figueroa;  sales on a fairly steady basis to several identified customers in Maine (Babbitt, Poland, Kierstead), as well as some customers not identified but whose existence could be inferred;  conversations in which appellant revealed to Figueroa the prices he was charging Maine buyers, apologized to Soto for \"the people here in Maine\" who preferred another product to his, and in which he told of future plans to sell heroin in Maine;  the quantities purchased by appellant, which were significantly in excess of any estimate of appellant's own consumption;  and, finally, the fact that, although appellant was without income and living on workman's compensation at the time, some $500 in cash was found in his bedroom when he was arrested.  This was sufficient evidence to support both a jury determination that appellant had joined with others in an agreement to distribute heroin and that he intended to commit the substantive offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calculation of drug quantity and base offense level.  In determining appellant's sentence, the judge accepted the conservative estimates of the total quantities of heroin involved set forth in the Presentence Investigation Report (PSR), and arrived at a total figure of 175.4 grams.  Based on an average consumption of 25 bags per week, and applying appropriate weights for the different time periods involved, the judge calculated appellant's total consumption at 60.25 grams.  Subtracting this from 175.4 still left a net quantity of slightly over 115 grams.  Accordingly, the judge concluded that, even taking into account appellant's personal heroin consumption, the relevant drug quantity would be still be in excess of 100 grams.  Thus, regardless of whether or not the district judge excluded appellant's personal heroin consumption in determining the relevant drug quantity, his base offense level under U.S.S.G. 2D1.1(10) would be 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant now claims that the evidence was that he consumed an average of five to six bags a day, or 35 to 42 bags a week.  Cumulating these quantities at appropriate weights per bag, he arrives at a personal use figure of 84.35 grams, which, when deducted from the total quantity, would produce a net figure of 91.05 grams, and a base offense level of 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if, as appellant suggests, the trial court were required to exclude the quantity of drugs he possessed for personal use in calculating his base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines,  see, e.g., United States v. Kipp, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658357\"><a href=\"/opinion/658357/united-states-v-dean-kipp/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1463</span></a></span>, 1465-66 (9th Cir. 1993), this claim would fail.  On the merits, there is sufficient evidence on the record from which the trial judge properly could conclude that appellant's personal use was, on average, 25 bags per week, and therefore, in excess of 100 grams of heroin were involved in the offense conduct.  And wholly apart from the merits of the claim, this issue has not been preserved for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, appellant's testimony at trial as to his consumption was something less than certain.  He testified that after getting out of a treatment program in October 8, 1991, he felt \"pretty good,\" but that by the beginning of November, he \"ended up using again.\"  At this time, he bought one bag at a time, and got high once every four or five days, and then, by mid-November, three or four times every week.  He also testified that at the time of his arrest in August 1992, \"maybe\" he used five bags a day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the evidence showed that appellant bought fluctuating amounts of heroin over time, and that during the course of the conspiracy, he spent two separate periods of time in a substance abuse treatment program, in an effort to treat his heroin addiction.  This evidence suggests that appellant's personal consumption likely could have varied relative to the amount of heroin available to him, and to his efforts at rehabilitation.  Finally, the PSR stated that \"[p]rior to his arrest, the defendant reports that his habit involved using up to 20 bags of heroin a week.\"  Based on all of this evidence, the district judge fairly could conclude that an average of 25 bags per week was representative of appellant's average consumption over time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, appellant has waived this claim.  He raised no objection to the PSR's estimate that he had \"up to\" a 20 bag per week habit.  Even more important, at the sentencing hearing, appellant made no suggestion that the judge had erred in his calculations as to appellant's personal consumption-a subject that the judge himself had introduced.  We note, in addition, that at oral argument before us, appellant's counsel contended that anyone with a habit requiring five bags a day could not get by on 25 bags a week because he could not \"take off two days a week.\"  But at the sentencing proceeding, trial counsel for appellant, in an effort to minimize the total quantity involved, argued that when appellant \"couldn't make the five bag a day habit which his cross- examination in trial showed he simply stayed home and suffered.\"  The judge was obviously committing no error, clear or otherwise, in harboring the same assumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the judge asked for any corrections.  Counsel for both prosecution and defense expressed themselves as satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude by observing that no injustice has been done in this case.  The court, by accepting conservative estimates of total quantities involved, which were substantially below those justified by some of the testimony, has been most fair to appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
