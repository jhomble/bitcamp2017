Plaintiff-Appellant,\n                                      \n\nCombined Management,  Inc. (\"CMI\"),  brought an action  to enjoin\n\nBrian   K.   Atchinson,  in   his   representative   capacity  as\n\nSuperintendent  of the Bureau of Insurance for the State of Maine\n\n(the  \"Superintendent\"),  from  enforcing  certain  provisions of\n\nMaine's workers' compensation statute.  39 M.R.S.A.   101 et seq.\n                                                                \n\nCMI  claimed that  because  CMI  provides  workers'  compensation\n\nbenefits  through a welfare benefit  plan that is  covered by the\n\nEmployee   Retirement   Income   Security  Act   (\"ERISA\"),   the\n\nSuperintendent's efforts to  apply the workers' compensation  law\n\nto CMI  are preempted by  ERISA    514(a) of ERISA,  29 U.S.C.   \n\n1144(a).   The district court dismissed  CMI's complaint, finding\n\nthat ERISA did not preempt Maine law.  We affirm.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          CMI  is an  employee  leasing company  that leases  the\n\nservices of  its workers' to a  variety of businesses on  a long-\n\nterm   basis.     CMI   provides  employee   benefits,  including\n\noccupational  injury  and  disability  benefits,  to  the  leased\n\nemployees through a subscription to the International Association\n\nof  Entrepreneurs  of America  Welfare  Benefit  Plan (the  \"IAEA\n\nPlan\").   The workers' compensation  portion of the  IAEA Plan is\n\nnot separately insured or administered.\n\n          Maine state  law, 32  M.R.S.A.    14055(1)(B), mandates\n\nthat employee  leasing companies or their  client businesses must\n\narrange  for the  payment  of workers'  compensation benefits  in\n\naccordance   with  the   requirements   of  the   Maine  Workers'\n\n                               -3-\n\nCompensation  Act,  39  M.R.S.A.    101  et  seq.   The  Workers'\n                                                \n\nCompensation  Act requires  that all  employers provide  workers'\n\ncompensation either through  an insurance  carrier authorized  by\n\nthe state or through a self-insurance plan that meets the state's\n\nqualifications.     39-A  M.R.S.A.     403.21     Maine  requires\n\nauthorized  insurance  carriers   and  self-insurers  to  provide\n\n                    \n\n1  39-A M.R.S.A.   403 provides in part:\n\n            An  employer  subject  to  [the  Workers'\n            Compensation]     Act    shall     secure\n            compensation  and  other benefits  to the\n            employer's  employees in  one or  more of\n            the ways described in this section. . . .\n\n            1.  INSURING UNDER  WORKERS' COMPENSATION\n            INSURANCE  POLICY.    The   employer  may\n            comply with this section by  insuring and\n            keeping  insured  the  payment   of  such\n            compensation and other  benefits under  a\n            workers' compensation insurance policy. .\n            . . \n\n            2. PILOT  PROJECTS.   [The  employer  may\n            participate   in   an  authorized   pilot\n            project.] . . . \n\n            3.  PROOF  OF   SOLVENCY  AND   FINANCIAL\n            ABILITY TO PAY; TRUST.  The  employer may\n            comply  with  this section  by furnishing\n            satisfactory proof  to the Superintendent\n            of  Insurance  of solvency  and financial\n            ability  to  pay  the   compensation  and\n            benefits,     and     depositing    cash,\n            satisfactory    securities,   irrevocable\n            standby letters  of  credit issued  by  a\n            qualified  financial   institution  or  a\n            surety bond  with the board,  in such sum\n            as the superintendent may determine . . .\n            .\n\n            4.   GROUP  SELF-INSURERS;   APPLICATION.\n            Except  for  the  provision  relating  to\n            individual public employer self-insurers,\n            subsection 3 is equally applicable in all\n            respects to group self-insurers.\n\n                               -4-\n\nevidence  of their  financial solvency  and meet  certain funding\n\nrequirements.  See, e.g., 24-A M.R.S.A.    221-A, 410, 4431-4452;\n                        \n\n39-A M.R.S.A.    403, 404.\n\n          On January 29, 1993, the Maine Bureau of Insurance sent\n\na letter to CMI stating that  CMI's subscription to the IAEA Plan\n\ndid  not satisfy  its  obligation  under  state  law  to  provide\n\nworkers'  compensation   benefits  through  one  of  the  methods\n\nauthorized   by  39-A  M.R.S.A.     403.    The  letter  did  not\n\n\"constitute a formal  order or action of  the Superintendent\" but\n\nit  did warn  that failure of  CMI to  comply with  the law could\n\nprompt some action in the future.\n\n          One  month   later,  CMI  filed  suit   to  enjoin  the\n\nSuperintendent from  requiring CMI  to  obtain separate  workers'\n\ncompensation  insurance or  to establish  a qualified  program of\n\nself-insurance  pursuant to 39-A M.R.S.A.   403.  CMI also sought\n\na  declaratory  judgment stating  that  any  enforcement of  39-A\n\nM.R.S.A.   403 against CMI is preempted by ERISA.\n\n          In   response  to  CMI's   request  for  a  preliminary\n\ninjunction, the magistrate judge  suggested that he first address\n\nthe   issue   of  whether   ERISA   preempted  Maine's   workers'\n\ncompensation laws.  Although CMI would have to establish that its\n\nbenefit plan, the IAEA  Plan, was an ERISA covered plan  under 29\n\nU.S.C.     1002(3)  and 1002(37)(A)  before it  could invoke  the\n\nprotections of ERISA's preemption provision, the magistrate noted\n\nthat determining the status of the IAEA Plan would involve a fact\n\nintensive inquiry requiring additional discovery.  Instead,  with\n\n                               -5-\n\nthe  agreement of  the parties, the  magistrate ordered  that the\n\npreemption issue be addressed first  on the understanding that if\n\nhe found ERISA did not  preempt Maine law, he would then  dismiss\n\nthe  case.  Thus, for  purposes of this  threshold question only,\n\nthe IAEA Plan is assumed to be a valid ERISA benefit plan.\n\n          On June  15, 1993, the magistrate  recommended a denial\n\nof the requested  preliminary injunction and  a dismissal of  the\n\ncase on the grounds  that ERISA did not preempt  Maine's workers'\n\ncompensation  law.    The  magistrate  found  that  the  workers'\n\ncompensation law did not \"relate to\" the IAEA Plan offered by CMI\n\nbecause  the law is a matter of general application affecting all\n\nprivate employers, whether or not they have adopted  ERISA plans,\n\nand   because   the   law   does  not   affect   the   structure,\n\nadministration, or type of benefits  provided by any ERISA  plan.\n\nOn  August 2, 1993, the  district court affirmed  and adopted the\n\nmagistrate's  recommended   decision.    CMI  now   appeals  this\n\ndecision.\n\n                      II.  ERISA PREEMPTION\n\n          ERISA  preempts state  laws that  \"relate to\"  an ERISA\n\ncovered  welfare  benefit  plan.

[W]hile the State  may\n            not  require an  employer  to  alter  its\n            ERISA plan, it may  force the employer to\n            choose   between   providing   disability\n            benefits  in  a  separately  administered\n            plan  and  including  the  state-mandated\n            benefits in its ERISA plan.  If the State\n            is  not satisfied  that  the  ERISA  plan\n            comports  with  the  requirements of  its\n            disability insurance law,  it may  compel\n            the  employer to maintain a separate plan\n            that does comply.\n\nId. at 108.

In\n                                      \n\nthe present  case, the  Superintendent expressed an  opinion that\n\nCMI's  subscription  to  the  IAEA  Plan  does  not  satisfy  the\n\nrequirements of  Maine's law.   Further  efforts to  ensure CMI's\n\ncompliance  with the  law  would  clearly  constitute an  act  to\n\n\"compel  the  employer to  maintain  a  separate plan  that  does\n\ncomply\"  with the  workers'  compensation law,  an  act which  is\n\nexplicitly approved of by Shaw.  Shaw, 463 U.S. at 108.\n                                     \n\n          Even though CMI provides workers' compensation benefits\n\nthrough the IAEA Plan, which we assumed is an ERISA covered plan,\n\nMaine's law does  not require,  and the  Superintendent does  not\n\nrequest, that  CMI alter the IAEA  Plan in any way  or provide or\n\n                               -10-\n\nnot provide certain benefits through the IAEA Plan.  In fact, the\n\nMaine law  imposes no limitations or  requirements, regulatory or\n\notherwise,  on  the  IAEA Plan  or  on  any  ERISA covered  plan.\n\nConsequently, it does  not \"relate  to\" an ERISA  plan such  that\n\npreemption is triggered.  In such a situation, CMI cannot don the\n\nmantle   of  ERISA   preemption  simply  by   including  workers'\n\ncompensation  benefits in  its welfare  benefit plan  and thereby\n\nescape the  requirements of Maine's law.   See Shaw, 463  U.S. at\n                                                   \n\n108;  Foust v.  City Ins. Co.,  704 F.

CMI\n\nwould  thus limit  the ERISA  exemption under    4(b)(3)  to laws\n\nmandating benefit outputs  instead of laws establishing  separate\n\nbenefit plans.  As a  corollary to this claim, CMI  contends that\n\nShaw  requires states to give employers a choice of providing the\n    \n\nspecified benefits  in its own ERISA plan  or in a state mandated\n\nbenefits  plan.  CMI maintains that  because ERISA allows welfare\n\nbenefit plans to provide workers' compensation benefits, refusing\n\nto give CMI  the option  of providing such  benefits through  the\n\nIAEA plan would effectively  bar what ERISA permits.

This is not the  same,\n\nhowever, as  imposing burdens on the welfare benefit plan itself.\n\nThe increased cost or administrative burdens imposed by the state\n\nlaw  must have some connection  to the covered  ERISA plan before\n\nthe preemption analysis  can come  into play.

Atchinson,  in   his   representative   capacity  as\n\nSuperintendent  of the Bureau of Insurance for the State of Maine\n\n(the  \"Superintendent\"),  from  enforcing  certain  provisions of\n\nMaine's workers' compensation statute.  39 M.R.S.A.   101 et seq.\n                                                                \n\nCMI  claimed that  because  CMI  provides  workers'  compensation\n\nbenefits  through a welfare benefit  plan that is  covered by the\n\nEmployee   Retirement   Income   Security  Act   (\"ERISA\"),   the\n\nSuperintendent's efforts to  apply the workers' compensation  law\n\nto CMI  are preempted by  ERISA    514(a) of ERISA,  29 U.S.C.   \n\n1144(a).   The district court dismissed  CMI's complaint, finding\n\nthat ERISA did not preempt Maine law.  We affirm.\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          CMI  is an  employee  leasing company  that leases  the\n\nservices of  its workers' to a  variety of businesses on  a long-\n\nterm   basis.     CMI   provides  employee   benefits,  including\n\noccupational  injury  and  disability  benefits,  to  the  leased\n\nemployees through a subscription to the International Association\n\nof  Entrepreneurs  of America  Welfare  Benefit  Plan (the  \"IAEA\n\nPlan\").   The workers' compensation  portion of the  IAEA Plan is\n\nnot separately insured or administered.\n\n          Maine state  law, 32  M.R.S.A.    14055(1)(B), mandates\n\nthat employee  leasing companies or their  client businesses must\n\narrange  for the  payment  of workers'  compensation benefits  in\n\naccordance   with  the   requirements   of  the   Maine  Workers'\n\n                               -3-\n\nCompensation  Act,  39  M.R.S.A.    101  et  seq.   The  Workers'\n                                                \n\nCompensation  Act requires  that all  employers provide  workers'\n\ncompensation either through  an insurance  carrier authorized  by\n\nthe state or through a self-insurance plan that meets the state's\n\nqualifications.     39-A  M.R.S.A.     403.21     Maine  requires\n\nauthorized  insurance  carriers   and  self-insurers  to  provide\n\n                    \n\n1  39-A M.R.S.A.   403 provides in part:\n\n            An  employer  subject  to  [the  Workers'\n            Compensation]     Act    shall     secure\n            compensation  and  other benefits  to the\n            employer's  employees in  one or  more of\n            the ways described in this section. . . .\n\n            1.  INSURING UNDER  WORKERS' COMPENSATION\n            INSURANCE  POLICY.    The   employer  may\n            comply with this section by  insuring and\n            keeping  insured  the  payment   of  such\n            compensation and other  benefits under  a\n            workers' compensation insurance policy. .\n            . . \n\n            2. PILOT  PROJECTS.   [The  employer  may\n            participate   in   an  authorized   pilot\n            project.] . . . \n\n            3.  PROOF  OF   SOLVENCY  AND   FINANCIAL\n            ABILITY TO PAY; TRUST.  The  employer may\n            comply  with  this section  by furnishing\n            satisfactory proof  to the Superintendent\n            of  Insurance  of solvency  and financial\n            ability  to  pay  the   compensation  and\n            benefits,     and     depositing    cash,\n            satisfactory    securities,   irrevocable\n            standby letters  of  credit issued  by  a\n            qualified  financial   institution  or  a\n            surety bond  with the board,  in such sum\n            as the superintendent may determine . . .\n            .\n\n            4.   GROUP  SELF-INSURERS;   APPLICATION.\n            Except  for  the  provision  relating  to\n            individual public employer self-insurers,\n            subsection 3 is equally applicable in all\n            respects to group self-insurers.\n\n                               -4-\n\nevidence  of their  financial solvency  and meet  certain funding\n\nrequirements.  See, e.g., 24-A M.R.S.A.    221-A, 410, 4431-4452;\n                        \n\n39-A M.R.S.A.    403, 404.\n\n          On January 29, 1993, the Maine Bureau of Insurance sent\n\na letter to CMI stating that  CMI's subscription to the IAEA Plan\n\ndid  not satisfy  its  obligation  under  state  law  to  provide\n\nworkers'  compensation   benefits  through  one  of  the  methods\n\nauthorized   by  39-A  M.R.S.A.     403.    The  letter  did  not\n\n\"constitute a formal  order or action of  the Superintendent\" but\n\nit  did warn  that failure of  CMI to  comply with  the law could\n\nprompt some action in the future.\n\n          One  month   later,  CMI  filed  suit   to  enjoin  the\n\nSuperintendent from  requiring CMI  to  obtain separate  workers'\n\ncompensation  insurance or  to establish  a qualified  program of\n\nself-insurance  pursuant to 39-A M.R.S.A.   403.  CMI also sought\n\na  declaratory  judgment stating  that  any  enforcement of  39-A\n\nM.R.S.A.   403 against CMI is preempted by ERISA.\n\n          In   response  to  CMI's   request  for  a  preliminary\n\ninjunction, the magistrate judge  suggested that he first address\n\nthe   issue   of  whether   ERISA   preempted  Maine's   workers'\n\ncompensation laws.  Although CMI would have to establish that its\n\nbenefit plan, the IAEA  Plan, was an ERISA covered plan  under 29\n\nU.S.C.     1002(3)  and 1002(37)(A)  before it  could invoke  the\n\nprotections of ERISA's preemption provision, the magistrate noted\n\nthat determining the status of the IAEA Plan would involve a fact\n\nintensive inquiry requiring additional discovery.  Instead,  with\n\n                               -5-\n\nthe  agreement of  the parties, the  magistrate ordered  that the\n\npreemption issue be addressed first  on the understanding that if\n\nhe found ERISA did not  preempt Maine law, he would then  dismiss\n\nthe  case.  Thus, for  purposes of this  threshold question only,\n\nthe IAEA Plan is assumed to be a valid ERISA benefit plan.\n\n          On June  15, 1993, the magistrate  recommended a denial\n\nof the requested  preliminary injunction and  a dismissal of  the\n\ncase on the grounds  that ERISA did not preempt  Maine's workers'\n\ncompensation  law.    The  magistrate  found  that  the  workers'\n\ncompensation law did not \"relate to\" the IAEA Plan offered by CMI\n\nbecause  the law is a matter of general application affecting all\n\nprivate employers, whether or not they have adopted  ERISA plans,\n\nand   because   the   law   does  not   affect   the   structure,\n\nadministration, or type of benefits  provided by any ERISA  plan.\n\nOn  August 2, 1993, the  district court affirmed  and adopted the\n\nmagistrate's  recommended   decision.    CMI  now   appeals  this\n\ndecision.\n\n                      II.  ERISA PREEMPTION\n\n          ERISA  preempts state  laws that  \"relate to\"  an ERISA\n\ncovered  welfare  benefit  plan.

Because disability\n\nbenefit laws  are  exempted from  ERISA's  coverage by  the  same\n\nprovision  exempting workers'  compensation laws,    4(b)(3),  29\n\nU.S.C.    1003(b)(3), the Shaw decision applies  directly to this\n                              \n\ncase.  The Supreme Court found in Shaw that:\n                                      \n\n            A  State  may   require  an  employer  to\n            maintain a disability plan complying with\n            state  law  as a  separate administrative\n            unit.

Congress surely  did\n            not intend, at the same time it preserved\n            the role  of  state disability  laws,  to\n            make    enforcement    of   those    laws\n            impossible.\n\nShaw, 463 U.S. at 108.\n    \n\n          Maine's workers' compensation law falls squarely within\n\nthe  dictates of  Shaw.    29-A  M.S.R.A.     403  mandates  that\n                      \n\nemployers  provide workers'  compensation by  purchasing approved\n\ninsurance or  by  establishing an  approved self-insurance  plan.\n\nThis is  precisely what the  Supreme Court  contemplated when  it\n\nfound  that  states \"may  require an  employer  to maintain  a [ \n\n4(b)(3)  exempt] plan as  a separate administrative  unit.\"  Id.;\n                                                               \n\naccord Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, 113 S. Ct. at 584-85.  In\n                                      \n\nthe present  case, the  Superintendent expressed an  opinion that\n\nCMI's  subscription  to  the  IAEA  Plan  does  not  satisfy  the\n\nrequirements of  Maine's law.   Further  efforts to  ensure CMI's\n\ncompliance  with the  law  would  clearly  constitute an  act  to\n\n\"compel  the  employer to  maintain  a  separate plan  that  does\n\ncomply\"  with the  workers'  compensation law,  an  act which  is\n\nexplicitly approved of by Shaw.  Shaw, 463 U.S. at 108.\n                                     \n\n          Even though CMI provides workers' compensation benefits\n\nthrough the IAEA Plan, which we assumed is an ERISA covered plan,\n\nMaine's law does  not require,  and the  Superintendent does  not\n\nrequest, that  CMI alter the IAEA  Plan in any way  or provide or\n\n                               -10-\n\nnot provide certain benefits through the IAEA Plan.  In fact, the\n\nMaine law  imposes no limitations or  requirements, regulatory or\n\notherwise,  on  the  IAEA Plan  or  on  any  ERISA covered  plan.\n\nConsequently, it does  not \"relate  to\" an ERISA  plan such  that\n\npreemption is triggered.  In such a situation, CMI cannot don the\n\nmantle   of  ERISA   preemption  simply  by   including  workers'\n\ncompensation  benefits in  its welfare  benefit plan  and thereby\n\nescape the  requirements of Maine's law.   See Shaw, 463  U.S. at\n                                                   \n\n108;  Foust v.  City Ins. Co.,  704 F.  Supp. 752,  754 (W.D.Tex.\n                             \n\n1989).\n\n          CMI  misinterprets Shaw  to hold  that states  can only\n                                 \n\nrequire  employers to  provide  a specified  level or  package of\n\nworkers'  compensation  benefits and  cannot  otherwise interfere\n\nwith plan administration through  provisions like the funding and\n\nsolvency requirements  established in 39-A  M.S.R.A.   403.   CMI\n\nwould  thus limit  the ERISA  exemption under    4(b)(3)  to laws\n\nmandating benefit outputs  instead of laws establishing  separate\n\nbenefit plans.  As a  corollary to this claim, CMI  contends that\n\nShaw  requires states to give employers a choice of providing the\n    \n\nspecified benefits  in its own ERISA plan  or in a state mandated\n\nbenefits  plan.  CMI maintains that  because ERISA allows welfare\n\nbenefit plans to provide workers' compensation benefits, refusing\n\nto give CMI  the option  of providing such  benefits through  the\n\nIAEA plan would effectively  bar what ERISA permits.

CMI\n\nremains  free  to  provide  the  existing  workers'  compensation\n\nbenefits to its employees and to integrate such benefits with the\n\nrest of  its ERISA plan benefits.   We are not  presented in this\n\ncase with a state workers'  compensation law that prohibits ERISA\n\ncovered plans from calculating pension benefits in a certain way,\n\nsee  Alessi, 451 U.S. at 521-26 (finding that ERISA preempted New\n           \n\nJersey law  that prohibited  ERISA plans from  offsetting pension\n\nbenefits by  amounts  awarded  for  workers'  compensation);  PPG\n                                                                 \n\nIndustries,  902  F.2d at  1150-51  (finding  preemption of  West\n          \n\nVirginia  law  that prohibited  an  employer  from deducting  the\n\namount  of pension benefits previously paid to a retiree from the\n\nretiree's subsequent workers' compensation  award), or a law that\n\nspecifically refers  to ERISA covered  benefit plans in  order to\n\ndetermine  workers' compensation benefits, see Greater Washington\n                                                                 \n\nBd. of Trade, 113 S. Ct. at 583-85 (holding that  ERISA preempted\n            \n\nDistrict  of Columbia  law requiring  that employers  who provide\n\nhealth insurance coverage for their employees under an ERISA plan\n\nmust  provide equivalent  health insurance  coverage for  injured\n\nemployees eligible for workers' compensation).  These cases cited\n\nby CMI in support  of its misguided interpretation of  Shaw found\n                                                           \n\npreemption  for reasons  that  do not  apply  to this  case.   We\n\n                               -14-\n\ntherefore  find that  a  state  law  that requires  employers  to\n\noperate  a separately administered  workers' compensation benefit\n\nplan is not preempted by ERISA.\n\n     B.  Does Maine's Law Nevertheless \"Relate To\" the IAEA Plan?\n                                                                 \n\n          CMI  further argues that  Maine's workers' compensation\n\nlaw relates to an ERISA plan, and thus is  preempted, because the\n\nlaw  affects  the  cost  of  providing   ERISA  benefits  to  its\n\nemployees.  Specifically,  CMI alleges  that if it  is forced  to\n\nadopt  a  separate workers'  compensation  plan,  the burdens  of\n\nduplicate administration and the higher cost of separate workers'\n\ncompensation benefits  provided  outside of  the integrated  IAEA\n\nPlan  will have a significant  economic impact on  CMI and render\n\nCMI unable to afford  the existing level of benefits  now offered\n\nthrough the  IAEA  Plan.   According  to CMI,  a state  law  that\n\ncreates a significant economic  impact on an ERISA plan,  without\n\nmore,  sufficiently  \"relates  to\"  the  plan  and  is  therefore\n\npreempted.

Travelers, 813  F. Supp. at\n                                               \n1006.  FMC Corp. v. Holliday makes no mention of  state laws that\n                            \nmerely impose additional costs.  Instead, the Supreme Court found\nthat state laws  interfering with an ERISA  plan's calculation of\nbenefits, in that case  through a state antisubrogation  law, was\npreempted.  FMC  Corp., 498 U.S. at 58-60.   Although we need not\n                      \ndecide  the issue in this case, the question of whether increased\ncosts alone can trigger preemption is far from settled.\n\n                               -15-\n\nsignificant  economic  impact on  an  ERISA covered  plan  may be\n\nsufficient by itself to trigger preemption because CMI's argument\n\nfails regardless of  how that  issue is resolved.   The  argument\n\nfails  for two reasons.  First, CMI's  claim is at odds with Shaw\n                                                                 \n\nand Greater Washington Bd.  of Trade, in which the  Supreme Court\n                                    \n\nexplicitly  contemplated   state  laws  requiring   the  separate\n\nadministration of workers'  compensation plans without  \"relating\n\nto\" existing ERISA plans.   Greater Washington Bd. of  Trade, 113\n                                                            \n\nS. Ct. at 584-85; Shaw, 463 U.S. at 108.\n                      \n\n          Second, Maine's law, while having an economic impact on\n\nCMI, does not  have an economic impact  on the IAEA Plan  itself.\n\nClearly,  any  law  that  increases  a  company's  cost of  doing\n\nbusiness can be said to affect that business's ability to provide\n\nbenefits under its welfare benefit  plan.  This is not the  same,\n\nhowever, as  imposing burdens on the welfare benefit plan itself.\n\nThe increased cost or administrative burdens imposed by the state\n\nlaw  must have some connection  to the covered  ERISA plan before\n\nthe preemption analysis  can come  into play.   See United  Wire,\n                                                                 \n\nMetal  and  Machine Health  &amp;  Welfare Fund,  v.
