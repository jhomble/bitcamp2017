Wayne  Coffin, and\n\nagainst the town of Standish and its police officer,  William\n\nMcAuliffe, alleging  false arrest in violation  of the United\n\nStates  and Maine Constitutions, 42 U.S.C.   1983 et seq., 15\n                                                        \n\nMe.R.S.A.   704, and  Maine common law.  An amended complaint\n\nadded officer Timothy Darnell  of Standish, alleging a second\n\nfalse  arrest.   The district  court referred  the suit  to a\n\nmagistrate.  28 U.S.C.    636(b)(1).  After discovery closed,\n\ndefendants moved for summary  judgment, and plaintiff filed a\n\nRule  56(f) motion  along with  his opposition.   The  motion\n\nsought  to  introduce  evidence   contradicting  defendants'.\n\nWithout taking up the motion,  the magistrate issued a report\n\nand recommended approval  of summary judgment on  defendants'\n\nevidence.    Upon a  general  objection,  the district  court\n\nconducted  a  de  novo  review, again  without  reference  to\n                      \n\nplaintiff's   motion,   and    accepted   the    magistrate's\n\nrecommendation.    Plaintiff appeals,  arguing  that material\n\nissues of fact exist,  and, for the first time,  pointing out\n\nthat the  magistrate and district court  improperly failed to\n\nregard the motion.  As these are questions of law, our review\n\nis  de novo.  Liberty Mut.  Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins.\n                                                             \n\nCo., 978 F.2d 750, 757 (1st Cir. 1992).  We affirm.\n   \n\n                             -2-\n\nThe November, 1989 Incident\n                           \n\n          At the time of  the alleged false arrests plaintiff\n\nwas on  probation for multiple  driving violations  including\n\ndriving  while  intoxicated.    On  November  7th,  1989,  he\n\ntelephoned  his probation officer,  Elizabeth Manchester, and\n\ninformed her  that he was too  ill to meet with  her that day\n\nfor their  bi-weekly meeting.  Several  hours later plaintiff\n\nappeared  at Tavern on the Hill, with one Frank Bickford, his\n\nemployer.   While  there, Bickford,  and his  son-in-law, who\n\nowned  the  tavern,  engaged  in an  altercation,  and,  when\n\ndefendant   officer   McAuliffe   of   Standish   arrived  to\n\ninvestigate, he and Bickford also began fighting.\n\n          Disputed on  appeal is whether there  is a question\n\nof  fact  regarding  plaintiff's  alleged  intoxication,  and\n\nwhether he joined the fracas or merely attempted  to restrain\n\nBickford.    Defendants officer  Blais  and  Sgt. Coffin,  of\n\nGorham, arrived after the fray, and recognized plaintiff as a\n\nprobationer.    Defendants assert  that  Sgt.  Coffin had  an\n\nofficer  call parole  officer  Manchester  and  describe  the\n\nincident and plaintiff's intoxication.  Manchester, according\n\nto  her   affidavit  of   record,  responded   by  requesting\n\nplaintiff's  arrest  for parole  violations.   In plaintiff's\n\nwould-be version, including  Manchester's asserted  testimony\n\nbefore a  sentencing court, Manchester was  called only after\n\n                             -3-\n\nthe officers  had arrested  plaintiff, outside, where  he was\n\nbehaving himself.\n\n          Defendants  could  not  normally   lawfully  arrest\n\nplaintiff without  a  warrant,  absent  probable  cause,  and\n\nintoxication  alone would  not  be such.    Cf. repealing  of\n                                              \n\nMe.R.S.A. 1954, c. 61,    94 by 1973, c. 582,   3.   However,\n\narrest  would be proper \"when requested by an official of the\n\ndivision   of   Probation  and   Parole.\"     17-A  Me.R.S.A.\n\n  15.1A(9).    If the  magistrate had  before  him a  copy of\n\nManchester's  court   testimony  we  read   it  as   arguably\n\ncontradicting  her affidavit as  to the order  of events, and\n\nsummary judgment should be denied.  Plaintiff, however, has a\n\ndifficulty.   Objection  to a  magistrate's report  preserves\n\nonly those  objections that  are specified.   See  Keating v.\n                                                          \n\nSecretary of  Health and Human  Services, 848  F.2d 271,  275\n                                        \n\n(1st Cir. 1988),  a case, incidentally, coming up from Maine.\n\nThe reason  for  this is  the universal  principle that  both\n\nefficiency and fairness dictate  that the judicial officer be\n\ngiven notice and  opportunity to correct  his or her  mistake\n\nbefore the taking of an appeal.\n\n          If plaintiff's motion should have been allowed, the\n\nmagistrate's failure to  pass on it  was a correctable  error\n\nwithin  this principle  just as  would have  been an  express\n\ndenial.      His   recommendation,   that   was   necessarily\n\ninconsistent with the motion,  was an implied denial thereof.\n\n                             -4-\n\nAddington v. Farmer's Elevator  Mut. Ins. Co., 650  F.2d 663,\n                                             \n\n666 (5th  Cir.), cert.  denied, 454 U.S.  1098 (1981),  cited\n                              \n\nwith approval,  Posadas de  Puerto Rico,  Inc. v.  Radin, 856\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 399, 401  (1st Cir.  1988).  Because  plaintiff did  not\n\nseasonally complain,  we cannot consider the  motion, and the\n\nrecord must stand without its content.\n\n          For  summary  judgment   purposes,  any  fact   not\n\nproperly controverted is admitted.  D. Me.  Loc. R. 19(b)(2).\n\nThe magistrate  was  thus correct  in  rejecting  plaintiff's\n\nstatement   in  \"opposition   to  defendants'   statement  of\n\nuncontroverted  facts\" for not citing sources, Rule 19(b)(2),\n\nand  in finding  that  plaintiff's  conclusory  statement  of\n\nmaterial facts failed  to create an  issue of material  fact.\n\nPosadas de Puerto Rico, ante.\n                            \n\nThe April, 1990 Incident\n                        \n\n          Plaintiff  was  walking  alone,  weaving  drunkenly\n\nbetween  the  roadway and  the  shoulder  of a  well-traveled\n\nStandish  road around 11:30 p.m., on or about April 21, 1990.\n\nHe was wearing  dark clothing, which made him  more difficult\n\nto see.  When he was in the roadway, passing cars were forced\n\nto  move to avoid him.  Defendant officer Darnell of Standish\n\nobserved plaintiff, approached and  spoke with him.  Deciding\n\nthat plaintiff was intoxicated and a safety hazard to himself\n\nand others, Darnell said he would give him a ride to his home\n\n                             -5-\n\nabout five miles away.  When plaintiff declined, Darnell gave\n\nhim a  choice of a ride  home or an arrest  for obstructing a\n\npublic way.   17-A Me.R.S.A.    505.  Plaintiff  accepted the\n\nride,  and Darnell  gave him a  quick pat-down  search before\n\nallowing him to sit  unrestrained in the rear seat.   Darnell\n\nthen drove plaintiff home.  Plaintiff seeks damages under the\n\nsame  claims of law as above, now against officer Darnell and\n\nthe town of Standish.\n\n          The   magistrate   recommended  summary   judgment,\n\nreasoning both that probable cause existed for an arrest, and\n\nthat plaintiff failed to provide defendants with the required\n\nnotice  for  his state  law  claims.   14  Me.R.S.A.    8107.\n\nPlaintiff does not contest the notice issue and his state law\n\nappeals therefore fail.\n\n          We will assume that insisting  on driving plaintiff\n\nto his home  as an alternative to  the police station  was an\n\narrest, see Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U.S. 567, 573 (1988),\n                                  \n\nand that  Darnell is  not protected  under  the principle  of\n\ncommunity caretaking.  But  cf. Cady v. Dombrowski,  413 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n433 (1973); South  Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U.S.  364, 368-371\n                                     \n\n(1976); United States v. Rodriguez-Morales, 929 F.2d 780 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir. 1991), cert.  denied, 112  S.Ct. 868 (1992).   17-A  Me.\n                         \n\nR.S.A.   505 provides as follows.\n\n            505.  Obstructing public ways\n\n               1.     A   person   is   guilty   of\n          obstructing    public    ways    if    he\n\n                             -6-\n\n          unreasonably  obstructs the  free passage\n          of  foot  or  vehicular  traffic  on  any\n          public  way,  and  refuses  to  cease  or\n          remove  the  obstruction  upon  a  lawful\n          order  to  do  so  given  him  by  a  law\n          enforcement officer.\n\nThis  was a  broadening  of its  predecessor,  17 Me.R.S.  A.\n\n  3961.\n\n            3961.  Placing obstructions on traveled\n                   road\n\n               Whoever places  rocks, stones, snow,\n          ice  or  other  obstructions  in  such  a\n          manner  as  to   obstruct  traffic  on  a\n          traveled road and leaves them there shall\n          be punished  by a  fine of not  more than\n          $10 for each offense,  to be recovered on\n          complaint, to the  use of the  town where\n          the offense is committed.\n\nWhile  the  point is  novel,  a  pedestrian wandering  about,\n\nintoxicated,  on a public way  is an obstruction  that may be\n\nordered to \"cease.\"\n\n          We must  observe that  we think this  claim a  fuss\n\nabout nothing.  Was plaintiff to be left on the highway?\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -7-\n",

Cf. repealing  of\n                                              \n\nMe.R.S.A. 1954, c. 61,    94 by 1973, c. 582,   3.   However,\n\narrest  would be proper \"when requested by an official of the\n\ndivision   of   Probation  and   Parole.\"     17-A  Me.R.S.A.\n\n  15.1A(9).    If the  magistrate had  before  him a  copy of\n\nManchester's  court   testimony  we  read   it  as   arguably\n\ncontradicting  her affidavit as  to the order  of events, and\n\nsummary judgment should be denied.  Plaintiff, however, has a\n\ndifficulty.   Objection  to a  magistrate's report  preserves\n\nonly those  objections that  are specified.

Because  plaintiff did  not\n\nseasonally complain,  we cannot consider the  motion, and the\n\nrecord must stand without its content.\n\n          For  summary  judgment   purposes,  any  fact   not\n\nproperly controverted is admitted.  D. Me.  Loc. R. 19(b)(2).\n\nThe magistrate  was  thus correct  in  rejecting  plaintiff's\n\nstatement   in  \"opposition   to  defendants'   statement  of\n\nuncontroverted  facts\" for not citing sources, Rule 19(b)(2),\n\nand  in finding  that  plaintiff's  conclusory  statement  of\n\nmaterial facts failed  to create an  issue of material  fact.\n\nPosadas de Puerto Rico, ante.\n                            \n\nThe April, 1990 Incident\n                        \n\n          Plaintiff  was  walking  alone,  weaving  drunkenly\n\nbetween  the  roadway and  the  shoulder  of a  well-traveled\n\nStandish  road around 11:30 p.m., on or about April 21, 1990.\n\nHe was wearing  dark clothing, which made him  more difficult\n\nto see.  When he was in the roadway, passing cars were forced\n\nto  move to avoid him.  Defendant officer Darnell of Standish\n\nobserved plaintiff, approached and  spoke with him.  Deciding\n\nthat plaintiff was intoxicated and a safety hazard to himself\n\nand others, Darnell said he would give him a ride to his home\n\n                             -5-\n\nabout five miles away.  When plaintiff declined, Darnell gave\n\nhim a  choice of a ride  home or an arrest  for obstructing a\n\npublic way.   17-A Me.R.S.A.    505.  Plaintiff  accepted the\n\nride,  and Darnell  gave him a  quick pat-down  search before\n\nallowing him to sit  unrestrained in the rear seat.   Darnell\n\nthen drove plaintiff home.  Plaintiff seeks damages under the\n\nsame  claims of law as above, now against officer Darnell and\n\nthe town of Standish.\n\n          The   magistrate   recommended  summary   judgment,\n\nreasoning both that probable cause existed for an arrest, and\n\nthat plaintiff failed to provide defendants with the required\n\nnotice  for  his state  law  claims.   14  Me.R.S.A.    8107.\n\nPlaintiff does not contest the notice issue and his state law\n\nappeals therefore fail.\n\n          We will assume that insisting  on driving plaintiff\n\nto his home  as an alternative to  the police station  was an\n\narrest, see Michigan v.

A   person   is   guilty   of\n          obstructing    public    ways    if    he\n\n                             -6-\n\n          unreasonably  obstructs the  free passage\n          of  foot  or  vehicular  traffic  on  any\n          public  way,  and  refuses  to  cease  or\n          remove  the  obstruction  upon  a  lawful\n          order  to  do  so  given  him  by  a  law\n          enforcement officer.\n\nThis  was a  broadening  of its  predecessor,  17 Me.R.S.
