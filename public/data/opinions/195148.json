The district  court denied\n\ntheir motion.  We reverse.\n\nI.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n                         \n\n          When  a defendant moves  for summary judgment  based on\n\nthe  doctrine of  qualified immunity, the  court must  review the\n\nfacts in the light most  favorable to the plaintiff.  See  Rogers\n                                                                 \n\nv. Fair, 902  F.2d 140, 143 (1st Cir. 1990).  The facts appearing\n       \n\nfrom the summary judgment materials are as follows.\n\n          On April l4, l990, Febus, who is mentally retarded, was\n\n                    \n\n1   Police  officers Miguel  Rodr guez-Rodr guez, H ctor  Rivera-\nSantiago,   Jos    Rivera-Ortiz,    the   conjugal   partnerships\nconstituted  between  the  defendants and  their  wives,  and the\nMunicipality  of Cayey, Puerto Rico,  are also defendants in this\naction.   These  defendants  are not,  however,  parties to  this\nappeal.\n\n                               -2-\n                                2\n\nperforming indecent gestures and breaching  the peace on a public\n\nstreet  in Cayey,  Puerto Rico.    After the  Puerto Rico  Police\n\nDepartment  received a  complaint  about  Febus' actions,  police\n\nofficers  H ctor  Rivera-Santiago  (\"H ctor Rivera\")  and  Miguel\n\nRodr guez-Rodr guez  (\"Rodr guez\") arrived at the scene.  A short\n\ntime later,  a Cayey  Municipal Guard,  Jos  Rivera-Ortiz  (\"Jos \n\nRivera\") arrived to assist them.  The three officers attempted to\n\nspeak to Febus.  Febus  allegedly resisted their attempts to calm\n\nhim  down, and a struggle ensued.  The officers then placed Febus\n\nunder arrest.\n\n          After Febus' arrest, the officers  transported Febus to\n\nthe  Cayey police  station.   From there,  Officer  Rodr guez and\n\nOfficer Jos  Rivera took Febus to the Guayama Court, where he was\n\ncharged  with breaching  the  peace and  resisting  arrest.   The\n\nofficers then brought Febus back  to the Cayey police station and\n\nthen released him.\n\n          Febus was severely beaten by the police officers during\n\nhis arrest and  he was denied medical treatment  for the injuries\n\nhe  suffered.2   Febus was  hospitalized from  April l4,  l990 to\n\nApril  24, l990.   As a result  of the events  of April 14, 1990,\n\nFebus  is  now  allegedly a  quadriplegic,  suffering  from post-\n\ntraumatic epilepsy, and aphasia.\n\n          Febus,  and   his  mother,   Catalina  Rodr guez-Pag n,\n\n                    \n\n2   Defendants Betancourt and  Oquendo have  conceded that  these\nevents  occurred for the purposes of this summary judgment motion\nonly.   It should be  noted, however, that  all of the defendants\ndeny that Febus was beaten,  or denied medical treatment on April\n19, 1990, or that they in any way caused Febus' alleged injuries.\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\noriginally  filed their  complaint in  this matter  on April  l5,\n\n1991, against police  officers Rodr guez, H ctor Rivera  and Jos \n\nRivera,  Superintendent Betancourt, and Mayor Oquendo, as well as\n\nother  defendants whose claims  are not relevant  to this appeal.\n\nThe  plaintiffs alleged  claims under  42 U.S.C.    1983 claiming\n\nthat the three  police officers  severely beat  Febus during  his\n\narrest, and  then denied  him necessary  medical treatment,  thus\n\nviolating  Febus' rights under  the Fourth, Sixth  and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments of the  Constitution.  The plaintiffs'  claims against\n\nBetancourt and  Oquendo were  based on  Betancourt's position  as\n\nsupervisor  of Officer Rodr guez  and Officer H ctor  Rivera, and\n\nOquendo's position  as supervisor  of Officer  Jos  Rivera.   The\n\nplaintiffs  claimed  that  Betancourt  and  Oquendo  were grossly\n\nnegligent in their  recruiting, training, and supervision  of the\n\npolice officers who were involved in this incident.\n\n          To  support their  allegations  against Betancourt  and\n\nOquendo,  the plaintiffs have  proffered the expert  affidavit of\n\nDr. Pedro Vales-Hern ndez (\"Dr. Vales\"),  a clinical psychologist\n\nand  criminologist.    After  reviewing  the officers'  personnel\n\nhistories and the facts surrounding the events on April 14, 1990,\n\nDr. Vales concluded:\n\n            [I]t  is   evident  that   Policemen  and\n            Municipal  Guards   are  not   adequately\n            trained within a professional orientation\n            where  physical  intervention  is  deemed\n            unnecessary.    There  is  not  a  single\n            course  in  their curriculum  related  to\n            crisis   intervention,  recognition   and\n            treatment  of  mentally  [i]nsane people,\n            treatment   of   non[-]visible   traumas,\n            [invasion]  of  psychological  perimeters\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\n            while approaching a person or even how to\n            makea [non-violent]intervention orarrest.\n            Furthermore,  it is  our contention  that\n            Police (or  Municipal Guard)  recruitment\n            practice[s] [are] extremely  lax.  People\n            with [deficient]  academic records,  poor\n            attitudes, and  personal pathologies  can\n            be   recruited   due  to   the   lack  of\n            rigorosity [sic] [in] the process.\n\n            Psychological assessment[s] of applicants\n            are  limited  to  an  interview  and  the\n            administration of a single test that will\n            not  measure  a  variety  of  personality\n            traits   not   compatible   with  healthy\n            standards.\n\n          On May  14, 1992, Betancourt and Oquendo filed a Motion\n\nto Dismiss and/or for  Summary Judgment, basing their  motion, in\n\npart, on the  doctrine of qualified immunity.   On April 7, 1993,\n\nthe  district  court  denied their  motion  without  explanation.\n\nBetancourt and Oquendo then filed this interlocutory appeal.\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\n             \n\n          A.  Jurisdiction \n\n          \"[A]  district court's denial  of a claim  of qualified\n\nimmunity, to the  extent that it turns on an issue  of law, is an\n\nappealable  'final decision'  within the  meaning of 28  U.S.C.  \n\n1291 . . .\"  Fonte v. Collins, 898  F.2d 284, 285 (1st Cir. 1990)\n                             \n\n(quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530 (1985)).  Because\n                            \n\na defendant's entitlement to qualified  immunity is a question of\n\nlaw in  this context,  appellate review is  plenary.   Hoffman v.\n                                                              \n\nReali, 973 F.2d  980, 985  (1st Cir. 1992).   Therefore, we  must\n     \n\nreview the record and examine the discovered facts  regarding the\n\nconduct  of Betancourt  and  Oquendo,  and  determine  whether  a\n\ngenuine  issue  does  or  does  not  exist  concerning  qualified\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\nimmunity.  Unwin v. Campbell, 863 F.2d 124, 132 (1st Cir. 1988).\n                            \n\n          B.  The Summary Judgment Standard\n\n          A motion for summary judgment must be granted if:\n\n            [T]he pleadings, depositions,  answers to\n            interrogatories, and admissions  on file,\n            together  with  the affidavits,  if  any,\n            show that there is no genuine issue as to\n            any  material  fact and  that  the moving\n            party  is entitled  to  a  judgment as  a\n            matter of law.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).   \"To succeed, the moving party must  show\n\nthat there  is an  absence of evidence  to support  the nonmoving\n\nparty's  position.\"   Rogers,  902  F.2d  at  143.   If  this  is\n                            \n\naccomplished,  the burden then \"shifts to  the nonmoving party to\n\nestablish the existence of an issue of fact that could affect the\n\noutcome of the litigation and  from which a reasonable jury could\n\nfind for the  [nonmoving party].\"  Id. (citations  omitted).  The\n                                      \n\nnonmovant   cannot  simply  rest  upon  mere  allegations.    Id.\n                                                                 \n\nInstead, the nonmoving party must adduce specific, provable facts\n\nwhich establish that  there is a triable issue.  Id.  \"There must\n                                                    \n\nbe 'sufficient  evidence favoring the nonmoving party  for a jury\n\nto return a  verdict for that party.   If the evidence  is merely\n\ncolorable or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may\n\nbe granted.'\"  Id. (quoting  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 242, 255 (1986)).  We now proceed to examine the substantive\n\nlegal principles that guide our   1983 analysis.\n\n          C.  Qualified Immunity\n\n          Qualified   immunity   shields   government   officials\n\nperforming discretionary functions from civil damages \"insofar as\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\ntheir conduct does  not violate clearly established  statutory or\n\nconstitutional rights  of which  a reasonable  person would  have\n\nknown.\"  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982); Hoffman,\n                                                                \n\n973 F.2d at 985.  On a motion for summary judgment, \"the relevant\n\nquestion is whether a reasonable official could have believed his\n\nactions were lawful  in light of clearly established  law and the\n\ninformation the official  possessed at the time of  his allegedly\n\nunlawful conduct.\"   McBride  v. Taylor, 924  F.2d 386,  389 (1st\n                                       \n\nCir. 1991); see Anderson v.  Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639 (1987).\n                                      \n\nAs  a  predicate  to  this inquiry,  however,  a  plaintiff  must\n\nestablish that a  particular defendant  violated the  plaintiff's\n\nfederally protected rights.  See   Boyle v. Burke, 925  F.2d 497,\n                                                 \n\n503  (1st Cir.  1991); Rogers,  902 F.2d  at 142-43;  Sullivan v.\n                                                              \n\nCarrick, 888 F.2d 1,  3 (1st Cir. 1989).  Thus, in the context of\n       \n\nthe  present summary judgment  motion, we must  determine whether\n\nthe  plaintiffs have introduced  sufficient evidence to  create a\n\ngenuine  issue of  material  fact  that  Betancourt  and  Oquendo\n\nviolated  Febus'  constitutional  rights,  and   if  so,  whether\n\nBetancourt andOquendo areotherwise entitledto qualifiedimmunity.3\n\n                    \n\n3   This  appeal  deals  only with  the  claims asserted  against\ndefendants Betancourt and Oquendo in their individual capacities.\nThe plaintiffs  originally sued  both Betancourt  and Oquendo  in\ntheir individual capacities as well as their official capacities.\nThe  district court previously  dismissed the  plaintiffs' claims\nagainst Betancourt in his  official capacity as violative of  the\nEleventh  Amendment.     The  district   court,  however,  denied\nOquendo's  motion  to  dismiss  the  action against  him  in  his\nofficial capacity.\n\n   Betancourt and  Oquendo then  moved for  summary judgment,  in\npart,  on  the basis  of  qualified  immunity.   The  sole  issue\npresently before  us  is the  district court's  refusal to  grant\n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\n          D.  Supervisory Liability\n\n          The  plaintiffs  do  not  contend  that  Betancourt  or\n\nOquendo was personally  involved in the incidents  which occurred\n\non April 14, 1990.  Rather,  the plaintiffs' claims are  premised\n\non supervisory liability.  The plaintiffs contend that Betancourt\n\nand Oquendo were  grossly negligent in recruiting,  training, and\n\nsupervising  the police  officers that  intervened  on April  14,\n\n1990,  and  that this  gross  negligence  rose  to the  level  of\n\ndeliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of Febus.\n\n          Supervisory  liability may  not  be  predicated upon  a\n\ntheory of respondeat superior.  Guti rrez-Rodr guez v. Cartagena,\n                                                                \n\n882 F.2d 553,  562 (1st Cir.  1989).  A  supervisor may be  found\n\nliable only on the basis of his  own acts or omissions.  Bowen v.\n                                                              \n\nCity of Manchester,  966 F.2d 13, 20 (1st  Cir. 1992); Guti rrez-\n                                                                 \n\nRodr guez, 882 F.2d at 562 (citing  Figueroa v.

Rather, a supervisor's acts or\n\nomissions must amount  to a reckless  or callous indifference  to\n\nthe  constitutional rights of  others.   Guti rrez-Rodr guez, 882\n                                                            \n\n                    \n\nBetancourt  and Oquendo  qualified  immunity.

Police Superintendent Betancourt\n\n          The  plaintiffs contend  that  Betancourt's actions  or\n\nomissions constituted  reckless or  callous  indifference in  two\n\nrespects.  First, the plaintiffs claim that Betancourt maintained\n\ndeficient recruiting and training practices.  As evidence of this\n\ndeficiency, the plaintiffs  rely on Dr. Vales'  statements in his\n\naffidavit that  1) Betancourt hired Officer Rodr guez,  who had a\n\npoor  academic record in  high school (demonstrating  that hiring\n\nprocedures  were   lax);  2)  Betancourt   failed  to  administer\n\npsychological  testing to police officers he hired; 3) Betancourt\n\nimproperly  trained  his  officers  because  the  police  academy\n\n                    \n\n4   In Guti rrez-Rodr guez,  882 F.2d at  562, this  Court stated\n                          \nthat there is  \"no difference of moment\" between  cases which use\nthe  \"gross  negligence  amounting  to  deliberate  indifference\"\nstandard and cases that use the reckless and callous indifference\nstandards.   \"[I]ndifference  that rises  to the  level  of being\ndeliberate,  reckless,   or   callous   suffices   to   establish\n[supervisory] liability under   1983.\"  Id.\n                                           \n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\ncurriculum contained only one course  in human relations and only\n\none course in civil rights, and there were no classes that taught\n\ncrisis intervention, how  to make nonviolent  arrests, or how  to\n\ndeal  with  mentally   handicapped  persons;5   and  4)   Officer\n\nRodr guez did not  receive additional training after  leaving the\n\npolice academy.\n\n          With  respect  to  claims  of  lack  of  proper  police\n\ntraining,   when implementing and maintaining a training program,\n\nin  order to  be  found  liable,  a supervisor  must  demonstrate\n\nreckless or callous indifference to  the rights of citizens.  See\n                                                                 \n\nVoutour v.  Vitale, 761 F.2d  812, 820-21 (1st Cir.  1985), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 474 U.S. 1100 (1986); see  generally Guti rrez-Rodr guez,\n                                                                \n\n882  F.2d at  562.    The plaintiffs  have  failed  to show  that\n\nBetancourt  demonstrated   the  requisite  reckless   or  callous\n\nindifference.  There is no evidence that Betancourt actually knew\n\nthat  there were any  problems with his  recruitment practices or\n\nhis training program.   The plaintiffs have also  failed to offer\n\nany evidence that  Betancourt should have  known that there  were\n\nrecruitment and training problems, and that he was indifferent to\n\nsuch  problems.     Betancourt's  recruiting  practices  and  his\n\ntraining  program,  on their  face,  do not  reflect  a conscious\n\npolicy  to hire incompetent officers and train them inadequately.\n\nSee, e.g., Santiago v. Fenton, 891 F.2d 373, 382 (1st Cir. 1989).\n                             \n\n                    \n\n5   In their  depositions, Officer Rodr guez  and Officer  H ctor\nRivera admit that,  beyond standard First  Aid classes, they  did\nnot receive formal training at the police academy with respect to\nhow to deal with mentally handicapped persons.\n\n                               -10-\n                                10\n\nThe plaintiffs did  not proffer any evidence  that these specific\n\npractices  violated  a  legally mandated  standard.    See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nVoutour, 761 F.2d  at 821.   Nor did plaintiffs  show that  these\n       \n\nspecific   practices  were  inferior  by  the  standards  of  the\n\nprofession.    See,  e.g., Santiago,  891  F.2d  at  382.     The\n                                   \n\nplaintiffs have also failed to introduce  any evidence that there\n\nwere previously any  problems with officers other  than Rodr guez\n\nbeing improperly  recruited or  inadequately trained.   Moreover,\n\nplaintiffs'  own expert,  Dr.  Vales,  does  not opine  that  the\n\nimplementation  or maintenance  of these  recruiting or  training\n\npractices constituted callous or reckless  indifference.  Rather,\n\nDr. Vales states  that the recruitment practices  were \"extremely\n\nlax\"  and officers were  not \"adequately  trained.\"   Perhaps the\n\nimplementation of  some of these policies was negligent, but even\n\nwhen we look at all of the asserted weaknesses taken together, we\n\nfail   to  see  how  a  jury  could  conclude  that  Betancourt's\n\nimplementation and maintenance of  these recruitment and training\n\npolicies  reflected  callous  or  reckless  indifference  to  the\n\nconstitutional rights of citizens.  See, e.g., Bowen, 966 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n21; Manarite  v. City of  Springfield, 957 F.2d 953,  957-58 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 113 (1992); Santiago, 891 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n381-82.6\n\n                    \n\n6   We are somewhat  troubled by Betancourt's failure  to provide\nofficers   with  training  about   how  to  deal   with  mentally\nhandicapped  persons.  Still,  we do  not find  that the  need to\nextensively  train officers about  how to identify  and deal with\nmentally handicapped persons  is so obvious, that failure to give\nthis  training  supports   a  finding  of  reckless   or  callous\nindifference to constitutional rights.   Even assuming, arguendo,\n                                                                \n\n                               -11-\n                                11\n\n          The  second  act  of reckless  or  callous indifference\n\nalleged   by  the  plaintiffs  is  that  Betancourt  was  grossly\n\nnegligent  in his supervision of  Officer Rodr guez.  As evidence\n\nof  this, the plaintiffs  point to five  complaints filed against\n\nOfficer Rodr guez  during his career  as a police officer.7   The\n\n                    \n\nthat Betancourt's failure to give such training was  callously or\nrecklessly indifferent,  the record  is bereft  of evidence  that\nthis failure was  affirmatively linked to the assault by Officers\nRodr guez and  H ctor Rivera  on Febus, and  to their  failure to\nprovide him with necessary medical  care.  For instance, there is\nno  evidence that Officers Rodr guez and H ctor Rivera improperly\napproached  Febus,  who  was  mentally  handicapped,   improperly\nattempted to calm him down, or  that their assault of him stemmed\nfrom the fact that they did not know  how to deal with a mentally\nhandicapped person.\n\n7    An  examination  of  Officer  Rodr guez'  personnel  history\nreflects  that these five  complaints stemmed from  the following\nevents:\n\n          1)   On September 23, l989, Officer Rodr guez\n          intervened in  a traffic accident,  where the\n          driver was taken to  the hospital, and  while\n          at  the hospital,  the  driver collapsed  and\n          died.   An autopsy  revealed the  driver died\n          because of  abdominal trauma.  (The personnel\n          history does not state what the nature of the\n          complaint against Officer Rodr guez was).\n\n          2)  On February  10, 1987, Officer  Rodr guez\n          went  to the Caguas  Court wearing a sweater,\n          and consequently he was inadequately dressed;\n\n          3)     A  citizen  complained   that  Officer\n          Rodr guez made an inadequate investigation of\n          a hit and run that occurred on July 28, 1989;\n\n          4)   On November  18, 1989, Officer Rodr guez\n          was  driving an  official vehicle  at a  high\n          speed, lost  control of the  vehicle, and ran\n          into a tree;\n\n          5)   Officer  Rodr guez had  a  child out  of\n          wedlock.\n\n   A  sixth complaint was  also levied against  Officer Rodr guez\n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n\nplaintiffs  also note  that according  to  his personnel  record,\n\nOfficer Rodr guez had  not been re-evaluated by  his supervisors.\n\nThe  plaintiffs  contend  that  Betancourt  was  responsible  for\n\ndisciplining Officer Rodr guez, and because  Betancourt failed to\n\ndo so in each of these five instances, Officer Rodr guez believed\n\nthat he was authorized to do as he pleased.\n\n          An important factor in determining whether a supervisor\n\nis liable to the extent  he has encouraged, condoned, acquiesced,\n\nor  been   deliberately  indifferent   to  the   behavior  of   a\n\nsubordinate,  is  whether  the  official was  put  on  notice  of\n\nbehavior  which was  likely to  result  in the  violation of  the\n\nconstitutional rights of citizens.  Lipsett, 864 F.2d at 902.\n                                           \n\n            [O]ne  cannot  make   a  \"deliberate\"  or\n            \"conscious\" choice . . . to act or not to\n            act unless confronted with a problem that\n            requires taking affirmative  steps.  Once\n            an  official   is  so   notified,  either\n            actually   or   constructively,   it   is\n            reasonable to  infer that the  failure to\n                                                  \n            take  such steps  as  well as  the actual\n            taking of them constitutes a choice \"from\n                  \n            among various alternatives.\"  . . .   One\n            obvious \"alternative\" is  to do something\n            to make the violations stop.\n\nId.  (citations omitted).  Despite the plaintiffs' contentions to\n   \n\nthe  contrary, we  do not  find that  the five  complaints levied\n\nagainst Officer Rodr guez provided Betancourt  with the requisite\n\nnotice.   The  five previous  complaints  stemmed from  incidents\n\ncompletely unrelated to  the present one:   Officer Rodr guez had\n\nbeen  called to  the scene  of an  automobile accident  where the\n\n                    \n\nwith respect to the incident in this action involving Febus.\n\n                               -13-\n                                13\n\ndriver of the car later collapsed in the hospital and died;8   he\n\nonce wore a sweater  to court; he had a child out  of wedlock; he\n\nhad  an  accident  in  an  official  vehicle;  and  he  allegedly\n\nconducted  a negligent  investigation of  a hit  and run.   These\n\ncomplaints  could not  have alerted  Betancourt to the  fact that\n\nOfficer  Rodr guez had  a propensity  to  assault citizens,  that\n\nOfficer Rodr guez  denied detainees necessary  medical treatment,\n\nor that Officer  Rodr guez was unable to  deal appropriately with\n\nmentally  handicapped persons.  Betancourt therefore did not know\n\nthat he  needed to supervise  Officer Rodr guez more  closely, or\n\ndiscipline  him, in order to prevent constitutional violations in\n\nthe  future.    Cf.  Guti rrez-Rodr guez,  882  F.2d  at  563-64.\n                                        \n\n(finding  superintendent liable for    1983 violation  because he\n\nhad knowledge of 13  citizen complaints and prior incidents  that\n\nmade him aware of the policeman's frequently brutal behavior, the\n\nsuperintendent took no action concerning those complaints, and he\n\nadministered a grossly deficient complaint procedure).\n\n          Betancourt's failure to sanction Officer Rodr guez with\n\nrespect to these complaints, in and of itself,  did not show that\n\nBetancourt  maintained a  grossly  deficient complaint  procedure\n\nthat inhibited proper  police discipline.9  Moreover,  Dr. Vales'\n\n                    \n\n8   There  was  no  indication  in Officer  Rodr guez'  personnel\nhistory  that he  should  have  known of  the  driver's need  for\nmedical  treatment,  or   that  he  denied  the   driver  medical\ntreatment.\n\n9  It is unclear from the  proffered evidence that any or all  of\nthese  complaints   required  Betancourt   to  sanction   Officer\nRodr guez.   The plaintiffs  claim that Superintendent Betancourt\nviolated 25  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25,    1014 (1979) by failing to\n\n                               -14-\n                                14\n\naffidavit only states  that there was \"negligent  and ineffective\n\nsupervision\" of  Officer Rodr guez by  Betancourt.   In light  of\n\nDr. Vales'  statements and the  nature of the  complaints against\n\nOfficer  Rodr guez, any alleged failure to sanction by Betancourt\n\nmay  have constituted  negligence,  but we  cannot  see how  this\n\nfailure amounted to reckless or callous indifference.\n\n          As  an  additional   ground  for  finding   this  claim\n\ninsufficient,     the  plaintiffs   have  failed   to  show   how\n\nBetancourt's alleged failure to  discipline Officer Rodr guez was\n\naffirmatively  linked to  Officer Rodr guez'  alleged assault  on\n\nFebus  on April  14, 1990.   The  inference that  because Officer\n\nRodr guez  had not  been sanctioned  with respect  to  these five\n\nincidents, he believed he could get away with anything, including\n\nassaulting  Febus, is  simply  too tenuous.    Dr. Vales  himself\n\nacknowledged this weak link when  he stated in his affidavit that\n\nBetancourt's   ineffective  supervision   of  Officer   Rodr guez\n\n\"probably\" created a  belief he could do as  he pleased.  Because\n\nthe  plaintiffs have failed  to introduce sufficient  evidence to\n\ncreate  a triable issue  that the police  superintendent violated\n\nFebus' constitutional rights, Betancourt is entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity.\n\n            2.  Mayor Oquendo\n\n          Mayor  Oquendo  is  similarly  entitled  to   qualified\n\n                    \n\neither impose  a sanction  upon Officer  Rodr guez or  officially\nabsolve him.   The plaintiffs have failed to  show, however, that\neach of  the complaints  charged incidents  that fell within  the\npurview of the  statute which establishes procedures  for dealing\nwith \"serious shortcomings.\"\n\n                               -15-\n                                15\n\nimmunity.    The  plaintiffs have  failed  to  produce sufficient\n\nevidence to create a triable  issue that Oquendo was callously or\n\nrecklessly indifferent to  his obligations to train  or supervise\n\nOfficer Jos   Rivera.   The  evidence which  supports this  claim\n\nconsists of Officer Jos  Rivera's  admission that he did not take\n\ncourses  at the  police  academy  on how  to  deal with  mentally\n\nhandicapped persons  or how  to recognize when  an individual  is\n\nsick,10  and Dr.  Vales' observations  that  Officer Jos   Rivera\n\nwas only  trained for  three months at  the police  academy, that\n\nOfficer  Jos  Rivera's performance was only evaluated twice prior\n\nto the Febus incident, and that there was no investigatory report\n\nin Rivera's  file regarding  the complaint  filed against him  by\n\nFebus.   This evidence is  of the same general  caliber, although\n\nweaker, than that  proffered against Betancourt.   The plaintiffs\n\nhave  not  proffered  any evidence  that  Oquendo  had actual  or\n\n                    \n\n10  Although  Officer Jos  Rivera stated  that he did not  take a\ncourse at the police academy on how to recognize when a person is\nsick, the plaintiffs  have not provided any other  evidence as to\nwhether or not the Cayey police academy provided any first aid or\nmedical training  to officers.   Assuming that such  classes were\nnot  offered at all,  the failure to provide  such courses may be\nnegligent.     There  are,   however,  no   clear  constitutional\nguideposts as to  the precise nature of the  obligations that the\nDue Process  Clause places upon  the police to seek  medical care\nfor   pretrial  detainees  who  have  been  injured  while  being\napprehended by the police.   See Canton v. Harris, 489  U.S. 378,\n                                                 \n388 n.8  (1988).  Therefore,  given this lack  of guidance  as to\nwhat  degree  of medical  care  police officers  are  required to\nprovide detainees, it is  difficult to conclude that the  failure\nto train officers to recognize  the need for medical treatment in\nthe  first  instance,  in  and  of itself,  reflects  callous  or\nreckless indifference  to constitutional  rights.   Additionally,\nthe plaintiffs  have failed  to demonstrate  an affirmative  link\nbetween Oquendo's failure to provide a course on how to recognize\nthe need for  medical treatment and Officer  Jos  Rivera's actual\nfailure to provide Febus with medical attention in this case.\n\n                               -16-\n                                16\n\nconstructive   knowledge   of   any   training   or   supervisory\n\ndeficiencies,  or that he  was indifferent to  such deficiencies.\n\nEven Dr. Vales does not conclude that Oquendo's implementation of\n\nthese practices reflected callous or reckless indifference to the\n\nconstitutional rights of  citizens.  We also do  not believe that\n\nthe evidence is sufficient to support such a conclusion.11\n\n          The  plaintiffs  have   failed  to  proffer  sufficient\n\nevidence to create a triable  issue as to whether the actions  of\n\nSuperintendent  Betancourt  and  Mayor  Oquendo  violated  Febus'\n\nconstitutional  rights.    Because   plaintiffs  have  failed  to\n\nestablish  this predicate, Betancourt and Oquendo are entitled to\n\nsummary  judgment.   Therefore, we  reverse the  decision  of the\n\ndistrict court,  and remand  with instructions  to enter  summary\n\njudgment for defendants Betancourt and Oquendo.\n\n          Reversed and remanded for  action consistent with  this\n                                                                 \n\nopinion.\n       \n\n                    \n\n11  The  plaintiffs claim that Oquendo failed  to investigate the\ncomplaint filed against  Officer Jos  Rivera with  respect to the\nFebus  incident.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a defendant moves for summary judgment based on the doctrine of qualified immunity, the court must review the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  See Rogers v. Fair, 902 F.2d 140, 143 (1st Cir.1990).  The facts appearing from the summary judgment materials are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 14, 1990, Febus, who is mentally retarded, was performing indecent gestures and breaching the peace on a public street in Cayey, Puerto Rico.  After the Puerto Rico Police Department received a complaint about Febus' actions, police officers Hector Rivera-Santiago (\"Hector Rivera\") and Miguel Rodriguez-Rodriguez (\"Rodriguez\") arrived at the scene.  A short time later, a Cayey Municipal Guard, Jose Rivera-Ortiz (\"Jose Rivera\") arrived to assist them.  The three officers attempted to speak to Febus.  Febus allegedly resisted their attempts to calm him down, and a struggle ensued.  The officers then placed Febus under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Febus' arrest, the officers transported Febus to the Cayey police station.  From there, Officer Rodriguez and Officer Jose Rivera took Febus to the Guayama Court, where he was charged with breaching the peace and resisting arrest.  The officers then brought Febus back to the Cayey police station and then released him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Febus was severely beaten by the police officers during his arrest and he was denied medical treatment for the injuries he suffered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Febus was hospitalized from April 14, 1990 to April 24, 1990.  As a result of the events of April 14, 1990, Febus is now allegedly a quadriplegic, suffering from post-traumatic epilepsy, and aphasia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Febus, and his mother, Catalina Rodriguez-Pagan, originally filed their complaint in this matter on April 15, 1991, against police officers Rodriguez, Hector Rivera and Jose Rivera, Superintendent Betancourt, and Mayor Oquendo, as well as other defendants whose claims are not relevant to this appeal.  The plaintiffs alleged claims under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 claiming that the three police officers severely beat Febus during his arrest, and then denied him necessary medical treatment, thus violating Febus' rights under the Fourth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution.  The plaintiffs' claims against Betancourt and Oquendo were based on Betancourt's position as supervisor of Officer Rodriguez and Officer Hector Rivera, and Oquendo's position as supervisor of Officer Jose Rivera.  The plaintiffs claimed that Betancourt and Oquendo were grossly negligent in their recruiting, training, and supervision of the police officers who were involved in this incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support their allegations against Betancourt and Oquendo, the plaintiffs have proffered the expert affidavit of Dr. Pedro Vales-Hernandez (\"Dr. Vales\"), a clinical psychologist and criminologist.  After reviewing the officers' personnel histories and the facts surrounding the events on April 14, 1990, Dr. Vales concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>[I]t is evident that Policemen and Municipal Guards are not adequately trained within a professional orientation where physical intervention is deemed unnecessary.

On April 7, 1993, the district court denied their motion without explanation.  Betancourt and Oquendo then filed this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Because a defendant's entitlement to qualified immunity is a question of law in this context, appellate review is plenary.  Hoffman v. Reali, 973 F.2d 980, 985 (1st Cir.1992).  Therefore, we must review the record and examine the discovered facts regarding the conduct of Betancourt and Oquendo, and determine whether a genuine issue does or does not exist concerning qualified immunity.  Unwin v. Campbell, 863 F.2d 124, 132 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Summary Judgment Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion for summary judgment must be granted if:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>[T]he pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  \"To succeed, the moving party must show that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's position.\"  Rogers, 902 F.2d at 143.   If this is accomplished, the burden then \"shifts to the nonmoving party to establish the existence of an issue of fact that could affect the outcome of the litigation and from which a reasonable jury could find for the [nonmoving party].\"  Id.  (citations omitted).  The nonmovant cannot simply rest upon mere allegations.  Id.  Instead, the nonmoving party must adduce specific, provable facts which establish that there is a triable issue.  Id.  \"There must be 'sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.  If the evidence is merely colorable or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.' \"  Id. (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2513, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).  We now proceed to examine the substantive legal principles that guide our Sec. 1983 analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Qualified Immunity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions from civil damages \"insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982);  Hoffman, 973 F.2d at 985.   On a motion for summary judgment, \"the relevant question is whether a reasonable official could have believed his actions were lawful in light of clearly established law and the information the official possessed at the time of his allegedly unlawful conduct.\"  McBride v. Taylor, 924 F.2d 386, 389 (1st Cir.1991);  see Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3038, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987).  As a predicate to this inquiry, however, a plaintiff must establish that a particular defendant violated the plaintiff's federally protected rights.  See Boyle v. Burke, 925 F.2d 497, 503 (1st Cir.1991);  Rogers, 902 F.2d at 142-43;  Sullivan v. Carrick, 888 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1989).  Thus, in the context of the present summary judgment motion, we must determine whether the plaintiffs have introduced sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that Betancourt and Oquendo violated Febus' constitutional rights, and if so, whether Betancourt and Oquendo are otherwise entitled to qualified immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Supervisory Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs do not contend that Betancourt or Oquendo was personally involved in the incidents which occurred on April 14, 1990.  Rather, the plaintiffs' claims are premised on supervisory liability.  The plaintiffs contend that Betancourt and Oquendo were grossly negligent in recruiting, training, and supervising the police officers that intervened on April 14, 1990, and that this gross negligence rose to the level of deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of Febus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Supervisory liability may not be predicated upon a theory of respondeat superior.  Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 562 (1st Cir.1989).  A supervisor may be found liable only on the basis of his own acts or omissions.  Bowen v. City of Manchester, 966 F.2d 13, 20 (1st Cir.1992);  Gutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 562 (citing Figueroa v. Aponte-Roque, 864 F.2d 947, 953 (1st Cir.1989)).  Moreover, a supervisor cannot be liable for merely negligent acts.  Rather, a supervisor's acts or omissions must amount to a reckless or callous indifference to the constitutional rights of others.  Gutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 562;  see Bordanaro v. McLeod, 871 F.2d 1151, 1163 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 820, 110 S.Ct. 75, 107 L.Ed.2d 42 (1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>An official displays such reckless or callous indifference when it would be manifest to any reasonable official that his conduct was very likely to violate an individual's constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Germany v. Vance, 868 F.2d 9, 18 (1st Cir.1989).  Moreover, there must be an \"affirmative link\" between the supervisory official's acts or omissions and his subordinate's violation of the plaintiff's constitutional rights.  Gutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 562;  Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 902 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Police Superintendent Betancourt</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs contend that Betancourt's actions or omissions constituted reckless or callous indifference in two respects.  First, the plaintiffs claim that Betancourt maintained deficient recruiting and training practices.  As evidence of this deficiency, the plaintiffs rely on Dr. Vales' statements in his affidavit that 1) Betancourt hired Officer Rodriguez, who had a poor academic record in high school (demonstrating that hiring procedures were lax);  2) Betancourt failed to administer psychological testing to police officers he hired;  3) Betancourt improperly trained his officers because the police academy curriculum contained only one course in human relations and only one course in civil rights, and there were no classes that taught crisis intervention, how to make nonviolent arrests, or how to deal with mentally handicapped persons;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and 4) Officer Rodriguez did not receive additional training after leaving the police academy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to claims of lack of proper police training, when implementing and maintaining a training program, in order to be found liable, a supervisor must demonstrate reckless or callous indifference to the rights of citizens.  See Voutour v. Vitale, 761 F.2d 812, 820-21 (1st Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1100, 106 S.Ct. 879, 88 L.Ed.2d 916 (1986);  see generally Gutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 562.   The plaintiffs have failed to show that Betancourt demonstrated the requisite reckless or callous indifference.  There is no evidence that Betancourt actually knew that there were any problems with his recruitment practices or his training program.  The plaintiffs have also failed to offer any evidence that Betancourt should have known that there were recruitment and training problems, and that he was indifferent to such problems.  Betancourt's recruiting practices and his training program, on their face, do not reflect a conscious policy to hire incompetent officers and train them inadequately.  See, e.g., Santiago v. Fenton, 891 F.2d 373, 382 (1st Cir.1989).  The plaintiffs did not proffer any evidence that these specific practices violated a legally mandated standard.  See, e.g., Voutour, 761 F.2d at 821.   Nor did plaintiffs show that these specific practices were inferior by the standards of the profession.  See, e.g., Santiago, 891 F.2d at 382.   The plaintiffs have also failed to introduce any evidence that there were previously any problems with officers other than Rodriguez being improperly recruited or inadequately trained.  Moreover, plaintiffs' own expert, Dr. Vales, does not opine that the implementation or maintenance of these recruiting or training practices constituted callous or reckless indifference.  Rather, Dr. Vales states that the recruitment practices were \"extremely lax\" and officers were not \"adequately trained.\"   Perhaps the implementation of some of these policies was negligent, but even when we look at all of the asserted weaknesses taken together, we fail to see how a jury could conclude that Betancourt's implementation and maintenance of these recruitment and training policies reflected callous or reckless indifference to the constitutional rights of citizens.  See, e.g., Bowen, 966 F.2d at 21;  Manarite v. City of Springfield, 957 F.2d 953, 957-58 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 113, 121 L.Ed.2d 70 (1992);  Santiago, 891 F.2d at 381-82.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second act of reckless or callous indifference alleged by the plaintiffs is that Betancourt was grossly negligent in his supervision of Officer Rodriguez.  As evidence of this, the plaintiffs point to five complaints filed against Officer Rodriguez during his career as a police officer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The plaintiffs also note that according to his personnel record, Officer Rodriguez had not been re-evaluated by his supervisors.  The plaintiffs contend that Betancourt was responsible for disciplining Officer Rodriguez, and because Betancourt failed to do so in each of these five instances, Officer Rodriguez believed that he was authorized to do as he pleased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An important factor in determining whether a supervisor is liable to the extent he has encouraged, condoned, acquiesced, or been deliberately indifferent to the behavior of a subordinate, is whether the official was put on notice of behavior which was likely to result in the violation of the constitutional rights of citizens.  Lipsett, 864 F.2d at 902.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>[O]ne cannot make a \"deliberate\" or \"conscious\" choice ... to act or not to act unless confronted with a problem that requires taking affirmative steps.  Once an official is so notified, either actually or constructively, it is reasonable to infer that the failure to take such steps as well as the actual taking of them constitutes a choice \"from among various alternatives.\"  ...  One obvious \"alternative\" is to do something to make the violations stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (citations omitted).  Despite the plaintiffs' contentions to the contrary, we do not find that the five complaints levied against Officer Rodriguez provided Betancourt with the requisite notice.  The five previous complaints stemmed from incidents completely unrelated to the present one:  Officer Rodriguez had been called to the scene of an automobile accident where the driver of the car later collapsed in the hospital and died;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  he once wore a sweater to court;  he had a child out of wedlock;  he had an accident in an official vehicle;  and he allegedly conducted a negligent investigation of a hit and run.  These complaints could not have alerted Betancourt to the fact that Officer Rodriguez had a propensity to assault citizens, that Officer Rodriguez denied detainees necessary medical treatment, or that Officer Rodriguez was unable to deal appropriately with mentally handicapped persons.  Betancourt therefore did not know that he needed to supervise Officer Rodriguez more closely, or discipline him, in order to prevent constitutional violations in the future.  Cf. Gutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 563-64.  (finding superintendent liable for Sec. 1983 violation because he had knowledge of 13 citizen complaints and prior incidents that made him aware of the policeman's frequently brutal behavior, the superintendent took no action concerning those complaints, and he administered a grossly deficient complaint procedure).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Betancourt's failure to sanction Officer Rodriguez with respect to these complaints, in and of itself, did not show that Betancourt maintained a grossly deficient complaint procedure that inhibited proper police discipline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Moreover, Dr. Vales' affidavit only states that there was \"negligent and ineffective supervision\" of Officer Rodriguez by Betancourt.  In light of Dr. Vales' statements and the nature of the complaints against Officer Rodriguez, any alleged failure to sanction by Betancourt may have constituted negligence, but we cannot see how this failure amounted to reckless or callous indifference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an additional ground for finding this claim insufficient, the plaintiffs have failed to show how Betancourt's alleged failure to discipline Officer Rodriguez was affirmatively linked to Officer Rodriguez' alleged assault on Febus on April 14, 1990.  The inference that because Officer Rodriguez had not been sanctioned with respect to these five incidents, he believed he could get away with anything, including assaulting Febus, is simply too tenuous.  Dr. Vales himself acknowledged this weak link when he stated in his affidavit that Betancourt's ineffective supervision of Officer Rodriguez \"probably\" created a belief he could do as he pleased.  Because the plaintiffs have failed to introduce sufficient evidence to create a triable issue that the police superintendent violated Febus' constitutional rights, Betancourt is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Mayor Oquendo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Oquendo is similarly entitled to qualified immunity.  The plaintiffs have failed to produce sufficient evidence to create a triable issue that Oquendo was callously or recklessly indifferent to his obligations to train or supervise Officer Jose Rivera.  The evidence which supports this claim consists of Officer Jose Rivera's admission that he did not take courses at the police academy on how to deal with mentally handicapped persons or how to recognize when an individual is sick,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and Dr. Vales' observations that Officer Jose Rivera was only trained for three months at the police academy, that Officer Jose Rivera's performance was only evaluated twice prior to the Febus incident, and that there was no investigatory report in Rivera's file regarding the complaint filed against him by Febus.  This evidence is of the same general caliber, although weaker, than that proffered against Betancourt.  The plaintiffs have not proffered any evidence that Oquendo had actual or constructive knowledge of any training or supervisory deficiencies, or that he was indifferent to such deficiencies.  Even Dr. Vales does not conclude that Oquendo's implementation of these practices reflected callous or reckless indifference to the constitutional rights of citizens.  We also do not believe that the evidence is sufficient to support such a conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have failed to proffer sufficient evidence to create a triable issue as to whether the actions of Superintendent Betancourt and Mayor Oquendo violated Febus' constitutional rights.  Because plaintiffs have failed to establish this predicate, Betancourt and Oquendo are entitled to summary judgment.

The plaintiffs originally sued both Betancourt and Oquendo in their individual capacities as well as their official capacities.  The district court previously dismissed the plaintiffs' claims against Betancourt in his official capacity as violative of the Eleventh Amendment.  The district court, however, denied Oquendo's motion to dismiss the action against him in his official capacity</p>\n        <p>Betancourt and Oquendo then moved for summary judgment, in part, on the basis of qualified immunity.  The sole issue presently before us is the district court's refusal to grant Betancourt and Oquendo qualified immunity.  Qualified immunity \"confers immunity only from individual-capacity suits, such as suits for money damages, that have been brought against government actors.\"  Carmen Nereida Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 705 (1st Cir.1993).  Qualified immunity does not, however, provide immunity to a governmental actor sued in his official capacity, because an \"official capacity suit is, in reality, a suit against the governmental entity, [and] not against the governmental actor.\"  Id.;  see generally Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165-67, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 3104-05, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985).  Thus, this appeal does not affect plaintiffs' claim against Oquendo in his official capacity, although that claim, in essence, is simply a claim against the Municipality of Cayey.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In Gutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 562, this Court stated that there is \"no difference of moment\" between cases which use the \"gross negligence amounting to deliberate indifference\" standard and cases that use the reckless and callous indifference standards.  \"[I]ndifference that rises to the level of being deliberate, reckless, or callous suffices to establish [supervisory] liability under Sec. 1983.\"  Id</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In their depositions, Officer Rodriguez and Officer Hector Rivera admit that, beyond standard First Aid classes, they did not receive formal training at the police academy with respect to how to deal with mentally handicapped persons</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We are somewhat troubled by Betancourt's failure to provide officers with training about how to deal with mentally handicapped persons.  Still, we do not find that the need to extensively train officers about how to identify and deal with mentally handicapped persons is so obvious, that failure to give this training supports a finding of reckless or callous indifference to constitutional rights.  Even assuming, arguendo, that Betancourt's failure to give such training was callously or recklessly indifferent, the record is bereft of evidence that this failure was affirmatively linked to the assault by Officers Rodriguez and Hector Rivera on Febus, and to their failure to provide him with necessary medical care.  For instance, there is no evidence that Officers Rodriguez and Hector Rivera improperly approached Febus, who was mentally handicapped, improperly attempted to calm him down, or that their assault of him stemmed from the fact that they did not know how to deal with a mentally handicapped person</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> An examination of Officer Rodriguez' personnel history reflects that these five complaints stemmed from the following events:</p>\n        <p>1) On September 23, 1989, Officer Rodriguez intervened in a traffic accident, where the driver was taken to the hospital, and while at the hospital, the driver collapsed and died.  An autopsy revealed the driver died because of abdominal trauma.  (The personnel history does not state what the nature of the complaint against Officer Rodriguez was);</p>\n        <p>2) On February 10, 1987, Officer Rodriguez went to the Caguas Court wearing a sweater, and consequently he was inadequately dressed;</p>\n        <p>3) A citizen complained that Officer Rodriguez made an inadequate investigation of a hit and run that occurred on July 28, 1989;</p>\n        <p>4) On November 18, 1989, Officer Rodriguez was driving an official vehicle at a high speed, lost control of the vehicle, and ran into a tree;</p>\n        <p>5) Officer Rodriguez had a child out of wedlock.</p>\n        <p>A sixth complaint was also levied against Officer Rodriguez with respect to the incident in this action involving Febus.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> There was no indication in Officer Rodriguez' personnel history that he should have known of the driver's need for medical treatment, or that he denied the driver medical treatment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> It is unclear from the proffered evidence that any or all of these complaints required Betancourt to sanction Officer Rodriguez.  The plaintiffs claim that Superintendent Betancourt violated 25 P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25, Sec. 1014 (1979) by failing to either impose a sanction upon Officer Rodriguez or officially absolve him.  The plaintiffs have failed to show, however, that each of the complaints charged incidents that fell within the purview of the statute which establishes procedures for dealing with \"serious shortcomings.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Although Officer Jose Rivera stated that he did not take a course at the police academy on how to recognize when a person is sick, the plaintiffs have not provided any other evidence as to whether or not the Cayey police academy provided any first aid or medical training to officers.  Assuming that such classes were not offered at all, the failure to provide such courses may be negligent.  There are, however, no clear constitutional guideposts as to the precise nature of the obligations that the Due Process Clause places upon the police to seek medical care for pretrial detainees who have been injured while being apprehended by the police.  See Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 388 n. 8, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1204 n. 8, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1988).  Therefore, given this lack of guidance as to what degree of medical care police officers are required to provide detainees, it is difficult to conclude that the failure to train officers to recognize the need for medical treatment in the first instance, in and of itself, reflects callous or reckless indifference to constitutional rights.  Additionally, the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate an affirmative link between Oquendo's failure to provide a course on how to recognize the need for medical treatment and Officer Jose Rivera's actual failure to provide Febus with medical attention in this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs claim that Oquendo failed to investigate the complaint filed against Officer Jose Rivera with respect to the Febus incident.  Assuming, arguendo, that this investigation was deficient, without any other supporting evidence of deficient investigatory practices, this is insufficient to establish a civil rights violation.  This single poorly performed investigation may reflect negligence, but we fail to see how it reflects callous or reckless indifference by Oquendo to the constitutional rights of citizens.  Additionally, the affirmative link between this alleged investigatory deficiency and Officer Jose Rivera's violation of Febus' constitutional rights is insufficient to establish liability.  Cf.

Springfield, 777 F.2d 801, 809 (1st Cir.1985), cert. granted, 475 U.S. 1064, 106 S.Ct. 1374, 89 L.Ed.2d 600 (1986), and cert. dismissed, 480 U.S. 257, 107 S.Ct. 1114, 94 L.Ed.2d 293 (1987) (police department's apparently sloppy post-shooting investigatory procedures alone were not linked sufficiently with harm to impose municipal liability)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The facts appearing from the summary judgment materials are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 14, 1990, Febus, who is mentally retarded, was performing indecent gestures and breaching the peace on a public street in Cayey, Puerto Rico.  After the Puerto Rico Police Department received a complaint about Febus' actions, police officers Hector Rivera-Santiago (\"Hector Rivera\") and Miguel Rodriguez-Rodriguez (\"Rodriguez\") arrived at the scene.  A short time later, a Cayey Municipal Guard, Jose Rivera-Ortiz (\"Jose Rivera\") arrived to assist them.  The three officers attempted to speak to Febus.  Febus allegedly resisted their attempts to calm him down, and a struggle ensued.

The officers then brought Febus back to the Cayey police station and then released him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Febus was severely beaten by the police officers during his arrest and he was denied medical treatment for the injuries he suffered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Febus was hospitalized from April 14, 1990 to April 24, 1990.  As a result of the events of April 14, 1990, Febus is now allegedly a quadriplegic, suffering from post-traumatic epilepsy, and aphasia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Febus, and his mother, Catalina Rodriguez-Pagan, originally filed their complaint in this matter on April 15, 1991, against police officers Rodriguez, Hector Rivera and Jose Rivera, Superintendent Betancourt, and Mayor Oquendo, as well as other defendants whose claims are not relevant to this appeal.  The plaintiffs alleged claims under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 claiming that the three police officers severely beat Febus during his arrest, and then denied him necessary medical treatment, thus violating Febus' rights under the Fourth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution.  The plaintiffs' claims against Betancourt and Oquendo were based on Betancourt's position as supervisor of Officer Rodriguez and Officer Hector Rivera, and Oquendo's position as supervisor of Officer Jose Rivera.  The plaintiffs claimed that Betancourt and Oquendo were grossly negligent in their recruiting, training, and supervision of the police officers who were involved in this incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support their allegations against Betancourt and Oquendo, the plaintiffs have proffered the expert affidavit of Dr. Pedro Vales-Hernandez (\"Dr. Vales\"), a clinical psychologist and criminologist.

Police Superintendent Betancourt</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs contend that Betancourt's actions or omissions constituted reckless or callous indifference in two respects.  First, the plaintiffs claim that Betancourt maintained deficient recruiting and training practices.  As evidence of this deficiency, the plaintiffs rely on Dr. Vales' statements in his affidavit that 1) Betancourt hired Officer Rodriguez, who had a poor academic record in high school (demonstrating that hiring procedures were lax);  2) Betancourt failed to administer psychological testing to police officers he hired;  3) Betancourt improperly trained his officers because the police academy curriculum contained only one course in human relations and only one course in civil rights, and there were no classes that taught crisis intervention, how to make nonviolent arrests, or how to deal with mentally handicapped persons;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and 4) Officer Rodriguez did not receive additional training after leaving the police academy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to claims of lack of proper police training, when implementing and maintaining a training program, in order to be found liable, a supervisor must demonstrate reckless or callous indifference to the rights of citizens.  See Voutour v. Vitale, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451880\"><a href=\"/opinion/451880/james-t-voutour-v-harold-vitale-james-t-voutour-v-harold-vitale/\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, 820-21 (1st Cir.1985), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1100</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></span> (1986);  see generally Gutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 562.   The plaintiffs have failed to show that Betancourt demonstrated the requisite reckless or callous indifference.  There is no evidence that Betancourt actually knew that there were any problems with his recruitment practices or his training program.  The plaintiffs have also failed to offer any evidence that Betancourt should have known that there were recruitment and training problems, and that he was indifferent to such problems.  Betancourt's recruiting practices and his training program, on their face, do not reflect a conscious policy to hire incompetent officers and train them inadequately.  See, e.g., Santiago v. Fenton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533566\"><a href=\"/opinion/533566/hector-santiago-v-paul-j-fenton-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>, 382 (1st Cir.1989).  The plaintiffs did not proffer any evidence that these specific practices violated a legally mandated standard.  See, e.g., Voutour, 761 F.2d at 821.   Nor did plaintiffs show that these specific practices were inferior by the standards of the profession.  See, e.g., Santiago, 891 F.2d at 382.   The plaintiffs have also failed to introduce any evidence that there were previously any problems with officers other than Rodriguez being improperly recruited or inadequately trained.  Moreover, plaintiffs' own expert, Dr. Vales, does not opine that the implementation or maintenance of these recruiting or training practices constituted callous or reckless indifference.  Rather, Dr. Vales states that the recruitment practices were \"extremely lax\" and officers were not \"adequately trained.\"   Perhaps the implementation of some of these policies was negligent, but even when we look at all of the asserted weaknesses taken together, we fail to see how a jury could conclude that Betancourt's implementation and maintenance of these recruitment and training policies reflected callous or reckless indifference to the constitutional rights of citizens.  See, e.g., Bowen, 966 F.2d at 21;  Manarite v. City of Springfield, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578608\"><a href=\"/opinion/578608/jessica-a-manarite-by-and-through-her-next-friend-carla-manarite-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span>, 957-58 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As evidence of this, the plaintiffs point to five complaints filed against Officer Rodriguez during his career as a police officer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The plaintiffs also note that according to his personnel record, Officer Rodriguez had not been re-evaluated by his supervisors.  The plaintiffs contend that Betancourt was responsible for disciplining Officer Rodriguez, and because Betancourt failed to do so in each of these five instances, Officer Rodriguez believed that he was authorized to do as he pleased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An important factor in determining whether a supervisor is liable to the extent he has encouraged, condoned, acquiesced, or been deliberately indifferent to the behavior of a subordinate, is whether the official was put on notice of behavior which was likely to result in the violation of the constitutional rights of citizens.  Lipsett, 864 F.2d at 902.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>[O]ne cannot make a \"deliberate\" or \"conscious\" choice ... to act or not to act unless confronted with a problem that requires taking affirmative steps.  Once an official is so notified, either actually or constructively, it is reasonable to infer that the failure to take such steps as well as the actual taking of them constitutes a choice \"from among various alternatives.\"  ...  One obvious \"alternative\" is to do something to make the violations stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (citations omitted).  Despite the plaintiffs' contentions to the contrary, we do not find that the five complaints levied against Officer Rodriguez provided Betancourt with the requisite notice.  The five previous complaints stemmed from incidents completely unrelated to the present one:  Officer Rodriguez had been called to the scene of an automobile accident where the driver of the car later collapsed in the hospital and died;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  he once wore a sweater to court;  he had a child out of wedlock;  he had an accident in an official vehicle;  and he allegedly conducted a negligent investigation of a hit and run.  These complaints could not have alerted Betancourt to the fact that Officer Rodriguez had a propensity to assault citizens, that Officer Rodriguez denied detainees necessary medical treatment, or that Officer Rodriguez was unable to deal appropriately with mentally handicapped persons.  Betancourt therefore did not know that he needed to supervise Officer Rodriguez more closely, or discipline him, in order to prevent constitutional violations in the future.  Cf. Gutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 563-64.  (finding superintendent liable for Sec. 1983 violation because he had knowledge of 13 citizen complaints and prior incidents that made him aware of the policeman's frequently brutal behavior, the superintendent took no action concerning those complaints, and he administered a grossly deficient complaint procedure).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Betancourt's failure to sanction Officer Rodriguez with respect to these complaints, in and of itself, did not show that Betancourt maintained a grossly deficient complaint procedure that inhibited proper police discipline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Moreover, Dr. Vales' affidavit only states that there was \"negligent and ineffective supervision\" of Officer Rodriguez by Betancourt.  In light of Dr. Vales' statements and the nature of the complaints against Officer Rodriguez, any alleged failure to sanction by Betancourt may have constituted negligence, but we cannot see how this failure amounted to reckless or callous indifference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an additional ground for finding this claim insufficient, the plaintiffs have failed to show how Betancourt's alleged failure to discipline Officer Rodriguez was affirmatively linked to Officer Rodriguez' alleged assault on Febus on April 14, 1990.  The inference that because Officer Rodriguez had not been sanctioned with respect to these five incidents, he believed he could get away with anything, including assaulting Febus, is simply too tenuous.  Dr. Vales himself acknowledged this weak link when he stated in his affidavit that Betancourt's ineffective supervision of Officer Rodriguez \"probably\" created a belief he could do as he pleased.  Because the plaintiffs have failed to introduce sufficient evidence to create a triable issue that the police superintendent violated Febus' constitutional rights, Betancourt is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Mayor Oquendo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Oquendo is similarly entitled to qualified immunity.  The plaintiffs have failed to produce sufficient evidence to create a triable issue that Oquendo was callously or recklessly indifferent to his obligations to train or supervise Officer Jose Rivera.  The evidence which supports this claim consists of Officer Jose Rivera's admission that he did not take courses at the police academy on how to deal with mentally handicapped persons or how to recognize when an individual is sick,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and Dr. Vales' observations that Officer Jose Rivera was only trained for three months at the police academy, that Officer Jose Rivera's performance was only evaluated twice prior to the Febus incident, and that there was no investigatory report in Rivera's file regarding the complaint filed against him by Febus.  This evidence is of the same general caliber, although weaker, than that proffered against Betancourt.  The plaintiffs have not proffered any evidence that Oquendo had actual or constructive knowledge of any training or supervisory deficiencies, or that he was indifferent to such deficiencies.  Even Dr. Vales does not conclude that Oquendo's implementation of these practices reflected callous or reckless indifference to the constitutional rights of citizens.  We also do not believe that the evidence is sufficient to support such a conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have failed to proffer sufficient evidence to create a triable issue as to whether the actions of Superintendent Betancourt and Mayor Oquendo violated Febus' constitutional rights.  Because plaintiffs have failed to establish this predicate, Betancourt and Oquendo are entitled to summary judgment.  Therefore, we reverse the decision of the district court, and remand with instructions to enter summary judgment for defendants Betancourt and Oquendo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded for action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Police officers Miguel Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Hector Rivera-Santiago, Jose Rivera-Ortiz, the conjugal partnerships constituted between the defendants and their wives, and the Municipality of Cayey, Puerto Rico, are also defendants in this action.

It should be noted, however, that all of the defendants deny that Febus was beaten, or denied medical treatment on April 19, 1990, or that they in any way caused Febus' alleged injuries</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This appeal deals only with the claims asserted against defendants Betancourt and Oquendo in their individual capacities.  The plaintiffs originally sued both Betancourt and Oquendo in their individual capacities as well as their official capacities.  The district court previously dismissed the plaintiffs' claims against Betancourt in his official capacity as violative of the Eleventh Amendment.  The district court, however, denied Oquendo's motion to dismiss the action against him in his official capacity</p>\n        <p>Betancourt and Oquendo then moved for summary judgment, in part, on the basis of qualified immunity.  The sole issue presently before us is the district court's refusal to grant Betancourt and Oquendo qualified immunity.  Qualified immunity \"confers immunity only from individual-capacity suits, such as suits for money damages, that have been brought against government actors.\"  Carmen Nereida Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604127\"><a href=\"/opinion/604127/carmen-nereida-gonzalez-v-cirilo-tirado-delgado/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span>, 705 (1st Cir.1993).

Thus, this appeal does not affect plaintiffs' claim against Oquendo in his official capacity, although that claim, in essence, is simply a claim against the Municipality of Cayey.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In Gutierrez-Rodriguez, 882 F.2d at 562, this Court stated that there is \"no difference of moment\" between cases which use the \"gross negligence amounting to deliberate indifference\" standard and cases that use the reckless and callous indifference standards.  \"[I]ndifference that rises to the level of being deliberate, reckless, or callous suffices to establish [supervisory] liability under Sec. 1983.\"  Id</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In their depositions, Officer Rodriguez and Officer Hector Rivera admit that, beyond standard First Aid classes, they did not receive formal training at the police academy with respect to how to deal with mentally handicapped persons</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We are somewhat troubled by Betancourt's failure to provide officers with training about how to deal with mentally handicapped persons.  Still, we do not find that the need to extensively train officers about how to identify and deal with mentally handicapped persons is so obvious, that failure to give this training supports a finding of reckless or callous indifference to constitutional rights.  Even assuming, arguendo, that Betancourt's failure to give such training was callously or recklessly indifferent, the record is bereft of evidence that this failure was affirmatively linked to the assault by Officers Rodriguez and Hector Rivera on Febus, and to their failure to provide him with necessary medical care.  For instance, there is no evidence that Officers Rodriguez and Hector Rivera improperly approached Febus, who was mentally handicapped, improperly attempted to calm him down, or that their assault of him stemmed from the fact that they did not know how to deal with a mentally handicapped person</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> An examination of Officer Rodriguez' personnel history reflects that these five complaints stemmed from the following events:</p>\n        <p>1) On September 23, 1989, Officer Rodriguez intervened in a traffic accident, where the driver was taken to the hospital, and while at the hospital, the driver collapsed and died.  An autopsy revealed the driver died because of abdominal trauma.  (The personnel history does not state what the nature of the complaint against Officer Rodriguez was);</p>\n        <p>2) On February 10, 1987, Officer Rodriguez went to the Caguas Court wearing a sweater, and consequently he was inadequately dressed;</p>\n        <p>3) A citizen complained that Officer Rodriguez made an inadequate investigation of a hit and run that occurred on July 28, 1989;</p>\n        <p>4) On November 18, 1989, Officer Rodriguez was driving an official vehicle at a high speed, lost control of the vehicle, and ran into a tree;</p>\n        <p>5) Officer Rodriguez had a child out of wedlock.</p>\n        <p>A sixth complaint was also levied against Officer Rodriguez with respect to the incident in this action involving Febus.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> There was no indication in Officer Rodriguez' personnel history that he should have known of the driver's need for medical treatment, or that he denied the driver medical treatment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> It is unclear from the proffered evidence that any or all of these complaints required Betancourt to sanction Officer Rodriguez.  The plaintiffs claim that Superintendent Betancourt violated 25 P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25, Sec. 1014 (1979) by failing to either impose a sanction upon Officer Rodriguez or officially absolve him.  The plaintiffs have failed to show, however, that each of the complaints charged incidents that fell within the purview of the statute which establishes procedures for dealing with \"serious shortcomings.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Although Officer Jose Rivera stated that he did not take a course at the police academy on how to recognize when a person is sick, the plaintiffs have not provided any other evidence as to whether or not the Cayey police academy provided any first aid or medical training to officers.  Assuming that such classes were not offered at all, the failure to provide such courses may be negligent.  There are, however, no clear constitutional guideposts as to the precise nature of the obligations that the Due Process Clause places upon the police to seek medical care for pretrial detainees who have been injured while being apprehended by the police.  See Canton v. Harris, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></span>, 388 n. 8, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></span> (1988).  Therefore, given this lack of guidance as to what degree of medical care police officers are required to provide detainees, it is difficult to conclude that the failure to train officers to recognize the need for medical treatment in the first instance, in and of itself, reflects callous or reckless indifference to constitutional rights.  Additionally, the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate an affirmative link between Oquendo's failure to provide a course on how to recognize the need for medical treatment and Officer Jose Rivera's actual failure to provide Febus with medical attention in this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs claim that Oquendo failed to investigate the complaint filed against Officer Jose Rivera with respect to the Febus incident.  Assuming, arguendo, that this investigation was deficient, without any other supporting evidence of deficient investigatory practices, this is insufficient to establish a civil rights violation.  This single poorly performed investigation may reflect negligence, but we fail to see how it reflects callous or reckless indifference by Oquendo to the constitutional rights of citizens.  Additionally, the affirmative link between this alleged investigatory deficiency and Officer Jose Rivera's violation of Febus' constitutional rights is insufficient to establish liability.  Cf.
