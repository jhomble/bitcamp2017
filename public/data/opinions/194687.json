Plaintiff-appellant Richard A. Street,\n                    \n\na Massachusetts  prison inmate, appeals the  grant of summary\n\njudgment   in  favor  of  defendant  correctional  officials.\n\nSummary judgment was entered by the district court after this\n\ncourt upheld the dismissal of certain claims but reversed the\n\ndismissal of plaintiff's  free exercise and equal  protection\n\nclaims.  Street v.  Maloney, No. 90-1280, slip op.  (Dec. 29,\n                           \n\n1990).  For the reasons that follow, we vacate and remand.\n\n                              I\n                               \n\n          Street  is  an adherent  of  a  sect of  the  Hindu\n\nreligion  commonly known as Hare Krishna.   He initiated this\n\naction  under 42  U.S.C.    1983  after  prayer beads  and  a\n\nreligious  necklace   that  he  had  ordered   in  1988  were\n\nconfiscated  by prison  officials.   At the time,  Street was\n\nconfined  to the  Departmental  Segregation Unit  (DSU),  the\n\nprison's  highest  security  unit.    His  amended  complaint\n\ncharged that defendants Smith,  the prison property  officer,\n\nCaptain Gallagher, then administrator of the DSU, Maloney and\n\nRaikey, former and present  prison superintendents, and Hall,\n\na former deputy  superintendent, were  responsible, in  their\n\nindividual  and official  capacities, for  the expropriation.\n\nThe  core  of  Street's  complaint  is  that  the  defendants\n\ninfringed his  First and Fourteenth Amendment  rights to free\n\nexercise  of  religion and  equal protection  of the  laws by\n\nconfiscating the prayer beads and religious necklace while at\n\nthe  same time  allowing  Roman Catholic  inmates to  possess\n\nrosary beads and wear crucifixes.1\n\n          On  remand,   the  defendants  moved   for  summary\n\njudgment.   They  argued  that  1)  the confiscation  of  the\n\nplaintiff's  prayer beads  was  justified  because  of  their\n\n\"great  potential  as a  dangerous  weapon,\"  2) the  unusual\n\nsecurity  risks  posed  by  the prayer  beads  constituted  a\n\nrational basis  for any  difference in treatment  between the\n\nplaintiff and Catholic inmates, 3) the claims against Captain\n\nGallagher  should  be dismissed  under Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 4(j)\n\nbecause of failure to  effect service of process, and  4) the\n\nclaims against the remaining  defendants should be  dismissed\n\nbecause  of plaintiff's  failure to  individuate the  claims,\n\nthat is,  to allege facts showing  which defendants performed\n\nthe acts that purportedly impaired his constitutional rights.\n\n          Defendants'  motion was  supported by  Smith's two-\n\npage  affidavit.  As  the prison property  officer, Smith was\n\n                    \n\n1.   Plaintiff's  amended  complaint  also  alleged  that the\nconfiscation  was  in contravention  of the  Fourth Amendment\nright to be free of unreasonable seizures and  the Fourteenth\nAmendment  right to due  process, and that  the processing of\nthe   incoming   religious   items   violated   institutional\nregulations regarding  inmate mail.   Defendants here  assert\nthat  only plaintiff's free  exercise/equal protection claims\nsurvive  our prior  ruling  in this  case.   We  reject  that\ncontention.    Our  prior  opinion   explained  that  because\nplaintiff's amended complaint was not in the record, we would\nnot  presume  that  it was  before  the  district court  and,\nconsequently, we  would not address the  allegations therein.\nThus, plaintiff  remained free to  pursue the above-mentioned\nclaims on remand.\n\n                             -3-\n\nresponsible for handling  all incoming property,  maintaining\n\nrecords of  cell contents  and contraband, and   transferring\n\nproperty  to   other  institutions.     Smith  recalled  that\n\nplaintiff's  prayer beads  consisted  of  \"approximately  100\n\nbeads strung together on a strong  cord and joined to form  a\n\ncircle which measured approximately 36 inches, doubled.\"  The\n\nbeads,  he attested, \"were a  solid, hard material\" and \"were\n\nlarge, approximately 3/4 inch in diameter.\"  The prayer beads\n\n\"did  not  resemble in  any way  the  rosary beads  which are\n\nallowed inside the  institution.  The  rosary beads that  are\n\nallowed  . . . generally consist of very small hollow plastic\n\nbeads joined  on a  weak chain  with small,  easily breakable\n\nlinks.\"  Based on his experience, Smith felt that plaintiff's\n\nprayer  beads  \"posed  a  security risk  to  the  institution\n\nbecause  of their potential use  as weapons such  as a `sap',\n\n`numchucks', or  as a  `garotte'.\"2  Finally,  Smith affirmed\n\nthat DSU inmates \"have  been placed there as a result  of the\n\nmost   serious  rules   violations,  involving   violent  and\n\nextremely   disruptive   behavior,\"   and   that   \"the   DSU\n\nadministrator  and the  officer in  charge  of the  West Wing\n\nSegregation Unit also saw the  beads and determined that they\n\n                    \n\n2.   According  to  Smith,  a \"sap\"  consists  of  a  sock or\nsimilar  container into  which hard  objects are  placed, and\nwhich  is  used to  inflict  blows; \"numchucks\"  are  sets of\nbatons connected by  a length of  cable or chain, used  for a\nsimilar  purpose; a \"garrotte\" is a cord, thong, or length of\nwire, used to strangle a victim.\n\n                             -4-\n\nmust be removed because of the serious security concerns they\n\nposed.\"   The affidavit  identified neither of  the other two\n\nofficers by name.\n\n          Plaintiff's opposition contested the rationality of\n\nthe  defendants' asserted  security  justification.    In  an\n\naccompanying affidavit,  Street stated  that the  108 knotted\n\nbeads  were  1/2 inch  in diameter  and  made of  very light-\n\nweight, easily breakable wood, similar  to balsa wood.   \"The\n\nbeads  are not  solid, but  are hollow, like  Catholic rosary\n\nbeads, with a hole in the  center so they can be strung  on a\n\nstring.\"   The  string, about  36 inches  long and  1/64 inch\n\naround, was asserted to be very weak and easily  broken.  The\n\nreligious necklace was described as 18 inches long consisting\n\nof  54 tiny  wooden beads  (3/16 inch  long and  1/8 inch  in\n\ndiameter)  strung on a \"thin weak string\" which a young child\n\ncould \"easily break.\"\n\n          With  respect to  his religion,  Street's affidavit\n\nexplained  that  his faith  required  1728  repetitions of  a\n\nparticular  mantra daily,  using special  prayer beads.   The\n\nplaintiff  claimed  that  \"[w]ithout  said beads  it  is  not\n\npossible for  me to  obey this  commandment of  my religion.\"\n\nStreet  maintained  that he  had  been  allowed prayer  beads\n\nduring  a 1985  confinement in  the DSU,  and that  after his\n\nreturn there in June 1988 he received permission from Hall to\n\norder  the  beads.    When  they  arrived,  however,  Captain\n\n                             -5-\n\nGallagher  refused  to  allow  him  to  have  them.    Street\n\nprotested  to  Hall,  and  to Hall's  superiors,  Raikey  and\n\nMaloney,  about   the  confiscation,  but   they  refused  to\n\nintervene.  Street  declared that neither  he nor the  sender\n\nreceived the  required notice that the  beads were considered\n\ncontraband.   Finally, Street's  affidavit asserted  that his\n\njailers said to  him that  \"the Hare Krishnas  are fools  and\n\nworship a false God.\"\n\n          The district  court granted the  defendants' motion\n\nfor  summary  judgment.   The  court's  order  states in  its\n\nentirety:\n\n     Motion allowed.  Alleged  refusal to permit  inmate\n     to possess hare krishna [sic] beads and necklace in\n     the  Departmental Segregation Unit is not violative\n     of  Plaintiff's  Constitutional  rights,   as  such\n     refusal   is   reasonably  related   to  legitimate\n     penological  interests.  Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S.\n                                              \n     78, 85 (1987).\n\nThe standard  of review  is familiar,  see, e.g., Garside  v.\n                                                         \n\nOsco Drug, Inc., 895  F.2d 46, 48-49 (1st Cir. 1990),  and it\n               \n\nwould be pleonastic to repeat the standard here.\n\n                              II\n                                \n\n            Prison restrictions that implicate constitutional\n\nrights  are  judged  by  the reasonableness  standard.    See\n                                                             \n\nWashington  v. Harper,  494 U.S. 210,  224 (1990);  O'Lone v.\n                                                          \n\nEstate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342 (1987); Turner v. Safley, 482\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  78 (1987).    Under this  standard,  an inmate's  First\n\nAmendment right  must yield  to prison rules  and regulations\n\n                             -6-\n\nthat   are  \"reasonably  related  to  legitimate  penological\n\ninterest.\"   Turner, 482 U.S. at  89.  To  ensure that judges\n                   \n\naccord   appropriate  deference   to   decisions  of   prison\n\nadministrators  anent the delicate balance of these competing\n\nprinciples,  the Court  put in  place a  \"reasonableness test\n\nless  restrictive than  that  ordinarily  applied to  alleged\n\ninfringements of fundamental constitutional rights.\"  O'Lone,\n                                                            \n\n482 U.S. at 349 (punctuation and citation omitted).  Thus, if\n\nprohibiting plaintiff's possession  of certain  paraphernalia\n\nin  the DSU strikes a reasonable balance between the right to\n\nfree exercise of religion  and the prison's asserted interest\n\nin security,  plaintiff's First  Amendment claim will  fail.3\n\nSee Reed v. Faulkner, 842 F.2d 960, 962 (7th Cir. 1988).\n                    \n\n          The parties have briefed the appeal in terms of the\n\nTurner rubric.   Assuming,  arguendo, that Turner  applies to\n                                                 \n\nthe individualized decision here at issue, see, e.g., Frazier\n                                                             \n\nv. Dubois,  922  F.2d 560,  562  (10th Cir.  1990)  (applying\n         \n\nTurner to an individualized  prison action), the Turner Court\n                                                       \n\nidentified four factors that \"are relevant to, and that serve\n\nto  channel,  the  reasonableness inquiry.\"    Thornburgh  v.\n                                                         \n\nAbbott,  490  U.S. 401,  414 (1989).

We  assume,  for  present  purposes,  the   sincerity  of\nStreet's  professed  religious  beliefs.    Since  defendants\nelected  not to dispute this issue below, they cannot dispute\nit for the first time on appeal.\n\n                             -7-\n\nservices was upheld, the  Court summarized the Turner factors\n                                                     \n\nin the following manner:\n\n          1)   Does  the  challenged  regulation have  a\n               logical  connection   to  the  legitimate\n               governmental interests invoked to justify\n               it?\n\n          2)   Do  alternative  means of  exercising the\n               right remain open to prison inmates? \n\n          3)   What  impact  would the  accommodation of\n               the inmate's asserted right have on other\n               inmates,  on  prison  personnel,  and  on\n               prison resources generally?\n\n          4)   Are there obvious,  easy alternatives  to\n               the   policy   adopted   by  the   prison\n               administrators?\n\nO'Lone, 482 U.S. at 350-53 (citing Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-90,\n                                         \n\n93).     These  factors   have  regularly  been   applied  in\n\ndetermining whether a prison policy violates an inmate's free\n\nexercise rights.   See, e.g.,  Abdullah v.

Pri-Cor Inc.,  963 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n100, 103-04 (6th Cir. 1991).\n\n                             III\n                                \n\n          With respect to plaintiff's free exercise claim, we\n\nthink that  genuine issues of material  fact precluded brevis\n                                                             \n\ndisposition.  There are, for example, unanswered questions of\n\nfact  as to  the  composition of  the  prayer beads  (weight,\n\n                             -8-\n\ndensity,  etc.) which,  in turn,  prevent a  determination of\n\nwhether the ban on  them is reasonable, or, for  that matter,\n\nwhether  rosary beads in the  hands of other  DSU inmates are\n\ndeserving of  materially different treatment.   We accept the\n\ndefendants' legitimate  concern that  religious items in  the\n\npossession of inmates may lead to security problems.  But, we\n\nbelieve that the plaintiff has sufficiently put into question\n\nthe  possible danger to the  security of the  prison posed by\n\nthe prayer beads here at issue.\n\n          It  also seems  logical  that the  more solitary  a\n\nreligious practice, the  less plausible is the claim  that an\n\ninstitutional  security  interest  is  compromised.    Turner\n                                                             \n\ninstructs that  \"a regulation  cannot be sustained  where the\n\nlogical connection  between the  regulation and  the asserted\n\ngoal  is so  remote  as to  render  the policy  arbitrary  or\n\nirrational.\"    Turner, 482  U.S.  at  89-90.    Unlike  free\n                      \n\nexercise  claims  involving  otherwise   non-religious  items\n\n(diet,  grooming,  name  changes,  and  the  like)  or  those\n\ninvolving  group associations  (such as  congregate worship),\n\nany  of which might impact the general prison population, the\n\nreligious activity  associated with the described  use of the\n\nprayer beads appears to involve solely private conduct.   The\n\nsignificance  of this  fact is  highlighted here  because, as\n\nplaintiff  points out,  he would  never be  able to  take the\n\nprayer beads outside  his cell; according to him, DSU inmates\n\n                             -9-\n\nare uniformly searched,  cuffed, and shackled before  leaving\n\ntheir cells.   Such a restriction, if true - - and defendants\n\nhave not challenged  the veracity of plaintiff's  account - -\n\nposits  an  accommodation  that  both  undercuts  defendants'\n\nstated security  concerns and raises questions  as to whether\n\nthey overreacted in denying Street the prayer beads.

We  think  it fitting  to note,\n                  \nhowever,  that  neither  defendants'  moving  papers  nor the\ndistrict court's order addressed either point.\n\n                             -11-\n\ndecisions cannot be arbitrary);  Nadeau v.

Thus, so  long as the\n\nprison  officials'   response  is  shown   to  be  rationally\n\nsupported, an equal  protection claim must  fail.  See  Reed,\n                                                            \n\n842  F.2d  at 962;  Brandon v.

Conversely,\n      \n\narbitrary enforcement of a stated security rationale violates\n\nprisoners' rights.  See, e.g., Benjamin v.

How prison authorities\n\nhave  accommodated  other  religions  is  relevant,  but  not\n\ndeterminative,  in  deciding  whether a  plaintiff  has  been\n\ntreated in  an unduly  restrictive manner.   See  Feeley, 570\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 371.  Assuming that prayer beads and rosary beads can\n\nbe equated for purposes of equal protection analysis, see id.\n                                                             \n\nat  375; Hatch  v.

As\n                                    \n\nnoted earlier, the defendants' affidavit describing the  type\n\nof rosary beads  that are \"generally\"  allowed to others  was\n\nsufficiently countered by the plaintiff's  opposing affidavit\n\nso as to  create material  questions as to  the relative  and\n\nrelevant differences between the religious items in question.\n\nThe affidavits also leave unresolved  questions about whether\n\nthe  treatment  accorded  the  plaintiff  was   disparate  or\n\nintentional.   These conflicts preclude  summary judgment  on\n\nthis count.\n\n                              V\n                               \n\n          We  need go no further.  We have considered most of\n\nthe  parties' other arguments on  appeal and find  them to be\n\nwithout merit.7   We hold,  however, on  the present  record,\n\nthat  the district court erred to the extent that it accepted\n\ndefendants'  proffered  security  rationale   as  conclusive.\n\n                    \n\n7.  We  say \"most\"  rather  than \"all\"  because the  district\ncourt  did   not  address  two  other   questions  raised  on\ndefendants' motion for summary  judgment, namely, a  supposed\nfailure to  allege  defendants' personal  involvement and  an\nasserted service-of-process  deficiency.  We take  no view of\nthese issues.   See Nereida-Gonzalez  v. Tirado-Delgado,  No.\n                                                       \n92-2084,  slip op. at  13 (1st Cir.  April 14, 1993).   We do\nnote,  however,  plaintiff's  sworn  statement  that  despite\nrepeated  requests on  his  part, prison  officials have  not\nprovided him with  the address  of a defendant  who has  left\ntheir  employ.    On  remand, plaintiff  should  be  afforded\nanother  opportunity to  perfect service  of process  on this\ndefendant.   By  the same  token,  defendants remain  free to\nreassert the defenses mentioned.\n\n                             -13-\n\nAccordingly,   since   the   facts  surrounding   defendants'\n\njustification for  refusing  to allow  plaintiff  to  possess\n\nprayer  beads and  a religious  necklace in  the DSU  require\n\nfurther development, we vacate  the grant of summary judgment\n\nin  favor   of  the   defendants,  and  remand   for  further\n\nproceedings to  be held before  another trier pursuant  to D.\n\nMass.

Plaintiff-appellant Richard A.

Street v.  Maloney, No. 90-1280, slip op.  (Dec. 29,\n                           \n\n1990).  For the reasons that follow, we vacate and remand.\n\n                              I\n                               \n\n          Street  is  an adherent  of  a  sect of  the  Hindu\n\nreligion  commonly known as Hare Krishna.   He initiated this\n\naction  under 42  U.S.C.    1983  after  prayer beads  and  a\n\nreligious  necklace   that  he  had  ordered   in  1988  were\n\nconfiscated  by prison  officials.   At the time,  Street was\n\nconfined  to the  Departmental  Segregation Unit  (DSU),  the\n\nprison's  highest  security  unit.    His  amended  complaint\n\ncharged that defendants Smith,  the prison property  officer,\n\nCaptain Gallagher, then administrator of the DSU, Maloney and\n\nRaikey, former and present  prison superintendents, and Hall,\n\na former deputy  superintendent, were  responsible, in  their\n\nindividual  and official  capacities, for  the expropriation.\n\nThe  core  of  Street's  complaint  is  that  the  defendants\n\ninfringed his  First and Fourteenth Amendment  rights to free\n\nexercise  of  religion and  equal protection  of the  laws by\n\nconfiscating the prayer beads and religious necklace while at\n\nthe  same time  allowing  Roman Catholic  inmates to  possess\n\nrosary beads and wear crucifixes.1\n\n          On  remand,   the  defendants  moved   for  summary\n\njudgment.   They  argued  that  1)  the confiscation  of  the\n\nplaintiff's  prayer beads  was  justified  because  of  their\n\n\"great  potential  as a  dangerous  weapon,\"  2) the  unusual\n\nsecurity  risks  posed  by  the prayer  beads  constituted  a\n\nrational basis  for any  difference in treatment  between the\n\nplaintiff and Catholic inmates, 3) the claims against Captain\n\nGallagher  should  be dismissed  under Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 4(j)\n\nbecause of failure to  effect service of process, and  4) the\n\nclaims against the remaining  defendants should be  dismissed\n\nbecause  of plaintiff's  failure to  individuate the  claims,\n\nthat is,  to allege facts showing  which defendants performed\n\nthe acts that purportedly impaired his constitutional rights.\n\n          Defendants'  motion was  supported by  Smith's two-\n\npage  affidavit.  As  the prison property  officer, Smith was\n\n                    \n\n1.   Plaintiff's  amended  complaint  also  alleged  that the\nconfiscation  was  in contravention  of the  Fourth Amendment\nright to be free of unreasonable seizures and  the Fourteenth\nAmendment  right to due  process, and that  the processing of\nthe   incoming   religious   items   violated   institutional\nregulations regarding  inmate mail.   Defendants here  assert\nthat  only plaintiff's free  exercise/equal protection claims\nsurvive  our prior  ruling  in this  case.   We  reject  that\ncontention.    Our  prior  opinion   explained  that  because\nplaintiff's amended complaint was not in the record, we would\nnot  presume  that  it was  before  the  district court  and,\nconsequently, we  would not address the  allegations therein.\nThus, plaintiff  remained free to  pursue the above-mentioned\nclaims on remand.\n\n                             -3-\n\nresponsible for handling  all incoming property,  maintaining\n\nrecords of  cell contents  and contraband, and   transferring\n\nproperty  to   other  institutions.     Smith  recalled  that\n\nplaintiff's  prayer beads  consisted  of  \"approximately  100\n\nbeads strung together on a strong  cord and joined to form  a\n\ncircle which measured approximately 36 inches, doubled.\"  The\n\nbeads,  he attested, \"were a  solid, hard material\" and \"were\n\nlarge, approximately 3/4 inch in diameter.\"  The prayer beads\n\n\"did  not  resemble in  any way  the  rosary beads  which are\n\nallowed inside the  institution.  The  rosary beads that  are\n\nallowed  . . . generally consist of very small hollow plastic\n\nbeads joined  on a  weak chain  with small,  easily breakable\n\nlinks.\"  Based on his experience, Smith felt that plaintiff's\n\nprayer  beads  \"posed  a  security risk  to  the  institution\n\nbecause  of their potential use  as weapons such  as a `sap',\n\n`numchucks', or  as a  `garotte'.\"2  Finally,  Smith affirmed\n\nthat DSU inmates \"have  been placed there as a result  of the\n\nmost   serious  rules   violations,  involving   violent  and\n\nextremely   disruptive   behavior,\"   and   that   \"the   DSU\n\nadministrator  and the  officer in  charge  of the  West Wing\n\nSegregation Unit also saw the  beads and determined that they\n\n                    \n\n2.   According  to  Smith,  a \"sap\"  consists  of  a  sock or\nsimilar  container into  which hard  objects are  placed, and\nwhich  is  used to  inflict  blows; \"numchucks\"  are  sets of\nbatons connected by  a length of  cable or chain, used  for a\nsimilar  purpose; a \"garrotte\" is a cord, thong, or length of\nwire, used to strangle a victim.\n\n                             -4-\n\nmust be removed because of the serious security concerns they\n\nposed.\"   The affidavit  identified neither of  the other two\n\nofficers by name.\n\n          Plaintiff's opposition contested the rationality of\n\nthe  defendants' asserted  security  justification.    In  an\n\naccompanying affidavit,  Street stated  that the  108 knotted\n\nbeads  were  1/2 inch  in diameter  and  made of  very light-\n\nweight, easily breakable wood, similar  to balsa wood.   \"The\n\nbeads  are not  solid, but  are hollow, like  Catholic rosary\n\nbeads, with a hole in the  center so they can be strung  on a\n\nstring.\"   The  string, about  36 inches  long and  1/64 inch\n\naround, was asserted to be very weak and easily  broken.  The\n\nreligious necklace was described as 18 inches long consisting\n\nof  54 tiny  wooden beads  (3/16 inch  long and  1/8 inch  in\n\ndiameter)  strung on a \"thin weak string\" which a young child\n\ncould \"easily break.\"\n\n          With  respect to  his religion,  Street's affidavit\n\nexplained  that  his faith  required  1728  repetitions of  a\n\nparticular  mantra daily,  using special  prayer beads.   The\n\nplaintiff  claimed  that  \"[w]ithout  said beads  it  is  not\n\npossible for  me to  obey this  commandment of  my religion.\"\n\nStreet  maintained  that he  had  been  allowed prayer  beads\n\nduring  a 1985  confinement in  the DSU,  and that  after his\n\nreturn there in June 1988 he received permission from Hall to\n\norder  the  beads.    When  they  arrived,  however,  Captain\n\n                             -5-\n\nGallagher  refused  to  allow  him  to  have  them.    Street\n\nprotested  to  Hall,  and  to Hall's  superiors,  Raikey  and\n\nMaloney,  about   the  confiscation,  but   they  refused  to\n\nintervene.  Street  declared that neither  he nor the  sender\n\nreceived the  required notice that the  beads were considered\n\ncontraband.   Finally, Street's  affidavit asserted  that his\n\njailers said to  him that  \"the Hare Krishnas  are fools  and\n\nworship a false God.\"\n\n          The district  court granted the  defendants' motion\n\nfor  summary  judgment.   The  court's  order  states in  its\n\nentirety:\n\n     Motion allowed.

There are, for example, unanswered questions of\n\nfact  as to  the  composition of  the  prayer beads  (weight,\n\n                             -8-\n\ndensity,  etc.) which,  in turn,  prevent a  determination of\n\nwhether the ban on  them is reasonable, or, for  that matter,\n\nwhether  rosary beads in the  hands of other  DSU inmates are\n\ndeserving of  materially different treatment.   We accept the\n\ndefendants' legitimate  concern that  religious items in  the\n\npossession of inmates may lead to security problems.  But, we\n\nbelieve that the plaintiff has sufficiently put into question\n\nthe  possible danger to the  security of the  prison posed by\n\nthe prayer beads here at issue.\n\n          It  also seems  logical  that the  more solitary  a\n\nreligious practice, the  less plausible is the claim  that an\n\ninstitutional  security  interest  is  compromised.    Turner\n                                                             \n\ninstructs that  \"a regulation  cannot be sustained  where the\n\nlogical connection  between the  regulation and  the asserted\n\ngoal  is so  remote  as to  render  the policy  arbitrary  or\n\nirrational.\"    Turner, 482  U.S.  at  89-90.    Unlike  free\n                      \n\nexercise  claims  involving  otherwise   non-religious  items\n\n(diet,  grooming,  name  changes,  and  the  like)  or  those\n\ninvolving  group associations  (such as  congregate worship),\n\nany  of which might impact the general prison population, the\n\nreligious activity  associated with the described  use of the\n\nprayer beads appears to involve solely private conduct.   The\n\nsignificance  of this  fact is  highlighted here  because, as\n\nplaintiff  points out,  he would  never be  able to  take the\n\nprayer beads outside  his cell; according to him, DSU inmates\n\n                             -9-\n\nare uniformly searched,  cuffed, and shackled before  leaving\n\ntheir cells.   Such a restriction, if true - - and defendants\n\nhave not challenged  the veracity of plaintiff's  account - -\n\nposits  an  accommodation  that  both  undercuts  defendants'\n\nstated security  concerns and raises questions  as to whether\n\nthey overreacted in denying Street the prayer beads.

How prison authorities\n\nhave  accommodated  other  religions  is  relevant,  but  not\n\ndeterminative,  in  deciding  whether a  plaintiff  has  been\n\ntreated in  an unduly  restrictive manner.   See  Feeley, 570\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 371.

If  the comparison between  prayer\n\nand  rosary   beads  can  fairly  be   made,  such  differing\n\n                    \n\n6.  The defendants' affidavit is  silent anent the wearing of\nreligious necklaces or crucifixes in the DSU.\n\n                             -12-\n\nrestrictions  point to  (but, again,  are not  conclusive of)\n\n\"possible  arbitrariness.\"    Feeley,  570 F.2d  at 364.   As\n                                    \n\nnoted earlier, the defendants' affidavit describing the  type\n\nof rosary beads  that are \"generally\"  allowed to others  was\n\nsufficiently countered by the plaintiff's  opposing affidavit\n\nso as to  create material  questions as to  the relative  and\n\nrelevant differences between the religious items in question.\n\nThe affidavits also leave unresolved  questions about whether\n\nthe  treatment  accorded  the  plaintiff  was   disparate  or\n\nintentional.   These conflicts preclude  summary judgment  on\n\nthis count.\n\n                              V\n                               \n\n          We  need go no further.  We have considered most of\n\nthe  parties' other arguments on  appeal and find  them to be\n\nwithout merit.7   We hold,  however, on  the present  record,\n\nthat  the district court erred to the extent that it accepted\n\ndefendants'  proffered  security  rationale   as  conclusive.\n\n                    \n\n7.  We  say \"most\"  rather  than \"all\"  because the  district\ncourt  did   not  address  two  other   questions  raised  on\ndefendants' motion for summary  judgment, namely, a  supposed\nfailure to  allege  defendants' personal  involvement and  an\nasserted service-of-process  deficiency.  We take  no view of\nthese issues.   See Nereida-Gonzalez  v. Tirado-Delgado,  No.\n                                                       \n92-2084,  slip op. at  13 (1st Cir.  April 14, 1993).   We do\nnote,  however,  plaintiff's  sworn  statement  that  despite\nrepeated  requests on  his  part, prison  officials have  not\nprovided him with  the address  of a defendant  who has  left\ntheir  employ.    On  remand, plaintiff  should  be  afforded\nanother  opportunity to  perfect service  of process  on this\ndefendant.   By  the same  token,  defendants remain  free to\nreassert the defenses mentioned.\n\n                             -13-\n\nAccordingly,   since   the   facts  surrounding   defendants'\n\njustification for  refusing  to allow  plaintiff  to  possess\n\nprayer  beads and  a religious  necklace in  the DSU  require\n\nfurther development, we vacate  the grant of summary judgment\n\nin  favor   of  the   defendants,  and  remand   for  further\n\nproceedings to  be held before  another trier pursuant  to D.\n\nMass. Loc. R. 40.1(i).\n\n          Vacated and remanded.  Costs to appellant.\n                                                   \n\n                             -14-\n</pre>",
