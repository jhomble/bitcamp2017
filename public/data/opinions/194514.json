Claimant Ricardo Padilla Perez appeals\n                    \n\na  district  court  judgment  affirming  a  decision  of  the\n\nSecretary  of Health  and  Human Services  denying his  third\n\nclaim for Social Security disability benefits.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     Claimant was  born in Puerto  Rico on February  7, 1940.\n\nHe completed the first grade and is illiterate.  As an adult,\n\nclaimant resided and worked in the mainland United States and\n\nPuerto Rico.  He speaks  some English.  Claimant worked as  a\n\nbookbinder  in the  New York  City area,  a job  that largely\n\nrequired  that  he stand  and  pack  cartons  with books  and\n\noccasionally use  a power  press.   In Puerto  Rico, claimant\n\nworked  as a  road  laborer  for  the Department  of  Natural\n\nResources performing maintenance and cleaning work.\n\n     Claimant   filed   three  applications   for  disability\n\nbenefits based on  an alleged mental  impairment.  The  first\n\nwas filed in  Puerto Rico  on September 2,  1982 and  alleged\n\nthat  claimant had  been unable  to work since  September 11,\n\n1981  due  to  a  nervous  condition.   The  Social  Security\n\nAdministration (SSA)  denied that claim after  initial review\n\nand reconsideration.   The  decision on  reconsideration took\n\nplace in May 1983  and claimant did not seek  further review.\n\nTwo years later, he filed his second application in New York,\n\nagain  alleging September  11,  1981 as  his date  of onset.1\n\n                    \n\n1.  This second application was filed during the grace period\ncreated by  the 1984  Social Security Disability  Reform Act,\nPub. L. 98-460, and entitled claimant to a redetermination of\n\nThat  claim   also  was   denied  upon  initial   review  and\n\nreconsideration.   This  time, claimant  sought review  by an\n\nadministrative  law judge  (ALJ).   After a  full hearing  at\n\nwhich   claimant  and  medical  advisor  Rafael  Nogueras  (a\n\npsychiatrist) testified, the ALJ  ruled that claimant was not\n\ndisabled on  March 27, 1986.   The  Appeals Council  declined\n\nfurther  review, thus  rendering  the  ALJ's decision  final.\n\nClaimant did not seek judicial review.   He immediately filed\n\nhis third  application, which is the subject of this appeal.2\n\n      In contrast  to his  first  two applications,  claimant\n\namended his third application to  allege February 25, 1978 as\n\nhis date  of onset. (Tr. 272).3  The SSA determined that some\n\nof the earnings that had been attributed to claimant when his\n\nprevious  applications  were  processed  were not,  in  fact,\n\nclaimant's earnings.  (Tr. 292, 296).   Consequently, the SSA\n\nredetermined  claimant's insured  status  and found  that  it\n\n                    \n\nthe whole period presented by his earlier claim.  (Tr. 497).\n\n2.  Although  claimant's third  application  alleged  a  back\nimpairment, he indicated that his primary ailment was mental.\nThe sole issue presented in  this appeal is whether  claimant\nwas disabled by his mental impairment.\n\n3.  Claimant filed  a statement in connection  with his third\napplication  wherein  he  alleged  that he  lost  his  Social\nSecurity card in New York and that the earnings that appeared\nin his record after 1978 did not belong to him.  (Tr. 294).  \n\n                             -3-\n\nexpired  on June  30,  1983.   (Tr.  298).4   The SSA  denied\n\nclaimant's third application on the ground of res judicata on\n                                                          \n\ninitial  review,  reconsideration,  and following  a  limited\n\nhearing  by  an  ALJ.5    The  Appeals  Council  vacated this\n\ndecision, finding that the ALJ's  March 1986 decision did not\n\naddress  certain consultative  evaluations from  the pre-June\n\n1983  period.    The   Appeals  Council  directed  the  ALJ's\n\nattention  to these reports and instructed him to issue a new\n\ndecision  after   considering  \"all  pertinent   evidence  of\n\nrecord.\"  (Tr. 504).     A  supplemental  hearing  was  held.\n\nOnce again,  claimant and  Dr. Nogueras testified.   Although\n\nclaimant maintained  that he had  not worked since  1978, the\n\nALJ found that he had earnings in 1980 and 1981  and that the\n\nquestion was whether claimant  was disabled between September\n\n11,  1981 (his previously alleged date of onset) and June 30,\n\n1983 (when his  insured status expired).   The ALJ found that\n\nduring this period, claimant suffered from an anxiety related\n\ndisorder and from alcohol  abuse in remission.  This  finding\n\nwas  based largely on the testimony of Dr. Nogueras. (Tr. 27,\n\n29).   This condition resulted in  only moderate restrictions\n\non  claimant's   activities  of   daily  living   and  social\n\n                    \n\n4.  The SSA's prior denial  assumed that claimant was insured\nthrough September 30, 1987.  (Tr. 250).\n\n5.  We  note that  the ALJ  who adjudicated  claimant's third\napplication  was  not the  same  ALJ  who  denied his  second\napplication.\n\n                             -4-\n\nfunctioning during the  relevant period, and seldom  resulted\n\nin  deficiencies of persistence, concentration or pace.   The\n\nALJ further found that  claimant never suffered from episodes\n\nof deterioration  or  decompensation  in  work  or  work-like\n\nsettings.   (Tr.  20).   Where  the  evidence in  the  record\n\nindicated that claimant's past jobs were unskilled, simple to\n\nperform, and  required no  complex mental functions,  the ALJ\n\nconcluded that claimant's  anxiety disorder did not  preclude\n\nhim from performing his past work before June  30, 1983.  The\n\nAppeals Council declined claimant's request for review,  thus\n\nrendering  this  second ALJ's  decision  final.   (Tr.  5-6).\n\nClaimant sought judicial review under 42 U.S.C.  405(g).  The\n\ndistrict court  adopted the report of a  magistrate judge and\n\nfound  that claimant had failed to prove that he was disabled\n\nbefore June 30, 1983.  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\n\n     In evaluating  any disability claim based  on an alleged\n\nmental   impairment,  the  SSA  must  follow  the  sequential\n\nevaluation  process outlined  in  20  C.F.R.    404.1520  and\n\n404.1520a.   See  Goodermote v. Secretary of Health and Human\n                                                             \n\nServices, 690 F. 2d 5, 6-7  (1st Cir. 1982).  Bearing in mind\n        \n\nthat Social Security proceedings are  not, strictly speaking,\n\nadversarial,  Deblois  v.  Secretary  of  Health   and  Human\n                                                             \n\nServices, 686 F.2d  76, 80  (1st Cir. 1982),  it remains  the\n        \n\nclaimant's   burden  to  prove  that  his  mental  impairment\n\n                             -5-\n\ndisabled him  from performing  his past relevant  work before\n                                                             \n\nhis insured status expired.  See, e.g., Santiago v. Secretary\n                                                             \n\nof Health and Human Services, 944  F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1991);\n                            \n\nGray  v. Heckler, 760 F.2d 369, 371 (1st Cir. 1985); Deblois,\n                                                            \n\n686 F.2d at 77.  Our review is limited to determining whether\n\nthe findings  of the  Secretary are supported  by substantial\n\nevidence  on the  record as  a whole.  Ortiz v.  Secretary of\n                                                             \n\nHealth  and  Human  Services,  955 F.2d  765,  769  (1st Cir.\n                            \n\n1991)(per curiam).\n\n     As  it  is  undisputed  that  claimant's  insured status\n\nexpired   on  June  30,  1983,  the  issue  here  is  whether\n\nsubstantial  evidence  supports  the Secretary's  nondisabled\n\nfinding for the period before this date. It is not enough for\n\nthe claimant  to establish that an  impairment which disabled\n\nhim from  working after his  insured status  expired had  its\n                       \n\nroots before then.  Deblois, 686 F.2d at 79.   While there is\n                           \n\nevidence  indicating  that  claimant's  condition   may  have\n\nreached  disabling severity  after 1986,  on balance,  we are\n\ncompelled  to agree that claimant  has not shown  that he was\n\ndisabled before June 30, 1983.  We review the record. \n\n                        III.                                 \n\n     The  earliest medical  records  indicate  that  claimant\n\nreported  experiencing  nervous  problems  and  daily alcohol\n\nconsumption in  1976 while  securing treatment for  trauma to\n\nhis left  knee.   He did  not seek  treatment for  his nerves\n\n                             -6-\n\nthen. (Tr. 358-59).   He sought  outpatient treatment at  the\n\nClinica Externas  de Adultos on August 20, 1979.  He was then\n\nthirty-nine years old.  He reported  that he had quit his job\n\nwith the Department of  Natural Resources because his \"nerves\n\nbetray[ed]\" him  and he claimed  to have been  unemployed for\n\nover a year.   (Tr. 171).  Mental examination  found claimant\n\ntense and anxious but  approachable, in contact with reality,\n\nand  with \"very acceptable\" judgment.  (Tr. 167).  An anxiety\n\nreaction was diagnosed and claimant was placed on Vistaril (a\n\ntranquilizer).  (Tr. 167).  No  further treatment is reported\n\nfor  approximately  two  years.6     Claimant  consulted  Dr.\n\nFerdinand Berrios  in August  1981 complaining of  chest pain\n\nand  shortness of  breath  associated with  states of  marked\n\nanxiety.  (Tr.  417-27).    Dr. Berrios  diagnosed  a  severe\n\nanxiety  neurosis  with  depressive  traits.   He  prescribed\n\nantianxiety  medications (Adapin  and Vistaril)  and Mellaril\n\n(an  antipsychotic)  and  recommended  that  claimant  obtain\n\npsychiatric treatment.  Claimant sought such treatment at the\n\noutpatient  clinic of  the Bayamon  Regional  Hospital, again\n\ncomplaining  of problems with  his nerves.    At this time it\n\n                    \n\n6.  As noted above, the  SSA's earnings records indicate that\nclaimant worked  during  this two  year period.   (Tr.  296).\nApart from his own statements, claimant submitted no evidence\nto rebut the SSA's earnings record.  We think it a relatively\nsimple matter for claimant's  counsel to secure  verification\nof  claimant's  alleged  dates  of  employment and  departure\ntherefrom.  Absent such evidence, we have no cause to second-\nguess the SSA's findings.     \n\n                             -7-\n\nwas reported that claimant made excessive use of alcohol.  In\n\nSeptember 1981 claimant was diagnosed to be suffering from an\n\nanxiety  reaction with  dissociative  features of  hysterical\n\norigin.   Mellaril and Adapin were continued and  counselling\n\nwas prescribed.   (Tr. 170).   In follow-up  visits over  the\n\nnext seven months claimant reported that the medications were\n\nnot  helping and that he  experienced hallucinations.  Yet in\n\nMay  1982  he  was  relevant, coherent  and  oriented  in all\n\nspheres.   (Tr. 175).  Mellaril was discontinued and Vistaril\n\nrestarted.  (Tr. 176).   \n\n     A  consulting psychiatrist, Dr.  Miguel Bravo, evaluated\n\nclaimant for the SSA on October 15, 1982.  (Tr. 411-13).  Dr.\n\nBravo  interviewed  claimant with  one  of  his cousins,  who\n\nreported that  claimant heard voices and  knocking sounds and\n\ndisappeared  from home  for days  at a  time during  which he\n\nwandered  the neighborhood and  became disoriented.  Claimant\n\nreported  that   he  spent   his  days  walking   around  the\n\nneighborhood,  occasionally  helping   with  the   housework,\n\nwatching T.V. or listening  to the radio.  He related well to\n\nfamily and neighbors  who visited him.  Personal  hygiene was\n\nadequate.     Dr.  Bravo  reported  that   claimant  appeared\n\nanguished during  his mental  examination and that  he cried,\n\nwith thought content centered around his difficulty keeping a\n\njob.    He  expressed  himself  with  difficulty,  exhibiting\n\nthought blocking, flight of ideas and occasional incoherence.\n\n                             -8-\n\nHis  intellect  appeared  below  average and  he  was  easily\n\ndistracted.   He  was disoriented  in  time and  place  while\n\noriented in person.   Memory was deteriorated  for all events\n\nand his  affect was  depressed.   Judgment  and insight  were\n\nnull.     Dr.  Bravo  diagnosed  a  chronic  undifferentiated\n\nschizophrenia and found that claimant was not able  to handle\n\nfunds.7     Shortly after  Dr. Bravo's  evaluation claimant's\n\ninternist (Dr. Berrios)  opined that  claimant was  disabled.\n\n(Tr. 418, 439). \n\n     Claimant was evaluated for  the SSA again in  March 1983\n\nby  another  psychiatrist,   Dr.  Mojica  Sandoz.8     Mental\n\nexamination found claimant  unshaven though clean, exhibiting\n\nslight psychomotor retardation.   He was slightly anxious and\n\ntense, but  accessible, cooperative  and frank.   He  did not\n\nshow   a   significant  impairment   in   his   capacity  for\n\n                    \n\n7.  Another   consultant,  Dr.   Ramon  Freese   Suarez,  (an\ninternist and cardiologist),  evaluated claimant in  November\n1982.   He found  a neuropsychiatric condition,  severe lower\nleg varicosities  and gastritis.   (Tr.  429).   Dr. Freese's\nreport indicates that claimant reported that he had worked in\nseveral factories in  New York but was thrown out of jobs due\nto his nervous  condition.  (Tr. 426).  In  contrast to other\nmedical records, Dr. Freese's  report indicates that claimant\nwas last employed in 1981 by the city of Corazol. (Tr. 426). \n\n8.  Claimant  told Dr.  Mojica that he  had not  worked since\n1977  or  1978,  his last  job  being  with  the Puerto  Rico\nDepartment of  Natural Resources.   He also reported  that he\nwounded  himself with a machete while he was so employed, and\nthat he had  to quit because  his superior did  not want  him\nworking  anymore.  He claimed to have been fired from another\njob as a janitor.  (Tr. 444-45).    \n\n                             -9-\n\nestablishing interpersonal relations.  (Tr. 445).  Though not\n\nspontaneous, claimant was logical, coherent and relevant.  He\n\nexhibited no suicidal or homicidal tendencies nor evidence of\n\nhallucinations.      He  also   did   not  show   personality\n\ndeterioration.     There   was  no   evidence   of  blocking,\n\ndisorganization,  nor  difficulty   in  the  formulation  and\n\nelaboration  of ideas.   Remote memory was spotty, but recent\n\nand  intermediate  memory   were  adequate.     Noting   that\n\nclaimant's  intellectual  functioning  appeared to  be  below\n\naverage,   Dr.   Mojica  diagnosed   an   unspecified  mental\n\nretardation and  dependent personality  disorder.   He  found\n\nclaimant able to handle funds. (Tr. 445-46).\n\n     Claimant  returned to  the outpatient  clinic in  Puerto\n\nRico again on May 5, 1983, at which time he reported that the\n\nmedications were helping him and that he was more calm.  (Tr.\n\n177).   No medical treatment is reported for more than a year\n\nafter claimant's  insured status expired.   Claimant returned\n\nto the outpatient clinic on October 15, 1984, claiming he had\n\nbeen  absent during the interim because he was caring for his\n\nsick  mother.  He appeared clean, anxious and oriented in all\n\nspheres. (Tr. 179).  His  memory and intellect were adequate,\n\nalthough  judgment and insight were poor.  A mild to moderate\n\nanxiety  disorder  was  diagnosed  and  Vistaril   was  again\n\nprescribed.  (Tr. 179-80).   An individualized treatment plan\n\ndated November 28, 1984 described claimant's anxiety disorder\n\n                             -10-\n\nas  chronic  and mild,  while  indicating  that claimant  had\n\nexhibited good adaptation over the last year.  (Tr. 181-184).\n\nA February 15, 1985 treatment  summary from the Mental Health\n\nCenter indicated that  claimant then had  a mild to  moderate\n\nanxiety disorder and was partially  limited in his ability to\n\ndo his usual work.  (Tr. 190-91).\n\n     The medical evidence following  claimant's return to New\n\nYork in  March 1985 suggests that  his condition periodically\n\nbecame more  dire.  After  filing his second  application for\n\ndisability  benefits, claimant allegedly began suffering from\n\nhallucinations   and  tried   to  kill   himself.     He  was\n\nhospitalized at  the South  Beach Psychiatric Center  between\n\nMay 17-25 and diagnosed  with an atypical psychosis.   A long\n\nhistory of alcohol abuse was identified, including blackouts,\n\ndelirium tremens  and one  prior suicide attempt.9   Claimant\n\nwas treated with Haldol (an antipsychotic)  and psychotherapy\n\nand  referred  to  Alcoholics  Anonymous.    (Tr.   199-206).\n\nShortly after his discharge  from the South Beach Psychiatric\n\nCenter claimant was  evaluated for  the SSA by  Dr. J.  Fiks.\n\nClaimant   appeared   manipulative,  demanding,   and  vague,\n\nexhibiting a  tendency to overreact  and exaggerate.   He was\n\nable to  provide information to suit his  needs but otherwise\n\nnoncommittal.  His reliability was  poor.  Dr. Fiks diagnosed\n\n                    \n\n9.  Claimant reported that he  had stopped drinking one month\nbefore his admission.  (Tr. 199).\n\n                             -11-\n\na  passive-aggressive  personality  disorder  and  questioned\n\nclaimant's ability to handle funds.  (Tr. 207-08).   \n\n     Claimant  secured further  treatment  from the  New York\n\nOffice of Mental  Health.10   He appeared to  improve in  the\n\nfall  of  1985  and remained  asymptomatic  despite decreased\n\nmedications.  At that time, claimant again was caring for his\n\nmother, who had had  surgery.  Another psychiatric evaluation\n\nfrom November 1985 indicated that claimant could not tolerate\n\nthe  pressure of  a  competitive  work  setting  due  to  the\n\nlikleihood of decompensating under stress.  (Tr. 212).  \n\n     The  SSA obtained  two assessments of  claimant's mental\n\nresidual  functional  capacity  (RFC) from  two  nonexamining\n\nconsultants.  On July  17, 1985, Dr. Alan Kaye  reported that\n\nclaimant  was limited  only  in his  capacity to  understand,\n\nremember and carry out technical job instructions.  He opined\n\nthat claimant  was capable  of work.   (Tr.  143,  146).   On\n\nDecember 16, 1985, Dr. A. Stockton reported that claimant was\n\nmoderately limited in  his abilities to  understand, remember\n\nand  carry  out  detailed  instructions,  interact  with  the\n\ngeneral  public, accept  instructions and  criticism, and  to\n\nrespond  to changes  in the  work setting  and set  realistic\n\ngoals.  (Tr.  148-50).  No other significant limitations were\n\nnoted.\n\n                    \n\n10.  Claimant also had surgery for varicose veins in his legs\nin June 1985.  (Tr. 233). \n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n     Claimant returned to Puerto  Rico in January 1986, where\n\nhis  second  application was  denied.    On  August 2,  1986,\n\nclaimant was evaluated by Dr. Cordero Alonso, a psychiatrist,\n\nin connection  with his third application (Tr.  458-63).  Dr.\n\nCordero  diagnosed a  schizophrenic syndrome  with histrionic\n\nfeatures.  He found claimant unable to handle funds.  Another\n\npsychiatrist, Dr.  Lopez Flores, evaluated claimant  on March\n\n7, 1987.  He diagnosed  a moderate severe dysthymic  disorder\n\nwith  agitation and  psychotic traits.  (Tr. 467-68).11   Two\n\nnonexamining consultants  made RFC  assessments.  On  May 15,\n\n1987,  psychologist  Orlando  Reboredo  found  that  claimant\n\nsuffered  from recurrent  major depression  with  anxiety and\n\npsychotic  episodes.   He found claimant  was not  capable of\n                                                 \n\nwork and that  his condition  met listing 12.04.   (Tr.  335-\n\n43).12   However, Dr. Reboredo was not  asked to focus on the\n\n                    \n\n11.  In  this interview,  claimant reported  that he  had not\nworked  since 1977 and that he had always had mental problems\nbut  that these were exacerbated after a sister died in 1985.\nClaimant  was then  being  treated with  Halcion (a  sleeping\npill)  and  Mellaril.    Claimant denied  using  alcohol  and\nreported  that his  mother  was insane.   Mental  examination\nfound  claimant  to   be  logical,  coherent  and   relevant,\nperception unstable, affect sad, and his mood was anxious and\ndepressed.   His concentration and attention  span were below\npar.  He   was  oriented   only  in  person,   and  exhibited\nsignificant  memory defects.  Judgment  lacked insight.  (Tr.\n468).\n\n12.  Dr.  Reboredo  indicated  that  claimant  suffered  from\nmarked  restrictions of  his activities  of daily  living and\ndifficulties  maintaining  social functioning,  with frequent\ndeficiencies of concentration, persistence  and pace, and one\nor two episodes of deterioration or decompensation in work or\nwork-like settings.   \n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nperiod  between 1978  and  1983.   Another psychologist,  Dr.\n\nPedro  Ivan Garcia, reviewed the evidence with a specific eye\n\nto evaluating claimant's condition before his insured  status\n\nexpired  on June 30, 1983.   He indicated  that that evidence\n\npointed  to a nonsevere anxiety disorder that did not meet or\n\nequal a listing. (Tr. 344, 346).13\n\n                             IV.\n\n     On appeal,  claimant argues  that the SSA's  decision is\n\nnot supported  by substantial  evidence on  the  record as  a\n\nwhole  because the  Secretary  relied on  isolated statements\n\nsupporting   a  non-disabled  finding   while  ignoring  what\n\nclaimant  says is  \"overwhelming evidence\"  to  the contrary.\n\nThe  argument overlooks  the fact that  most of  the evidence\n\nthat might  support a  disabled finding  was from  the period\n\nafter claimant's insured  status expired.   Medical  evidence\n\ngenerated after  a claimant's  insured status expires  may be\n\nconsidered for what light  (if any) it sheds on  the question\n\nwhether  claimant's  impairment  reached  disabling  severity\n\nbefore his insured status  expired.  See, e.g.,  Deblois, 686\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at 81 (holding ALJ should have asked consulting experts\n\nwhether pro se claimant's mental impairment reached disabling\n              \n\n                    \n\n13.  Dr.  Ivan  Garcia  noted  only   slight  restriction  of\nclaimant's  activities  of  daily  living   and  difficulties\nmaintaining  social functioning.   He reported  that claimant\nseldom experienced deficiencies of persistence, concentration\nor  pace,  and  that  he  never  suffered  from  episodes  of\ndeterioration in work  or work-like settings.  (Tr. 352).\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nseverity  before  his  insured  status expired);  Alcaide  v.\n                                                         \n\nSecretary of  Health and  Human Services, 601  F. Supp.  669,\n                                        \n\n672-73  (D.P.R.  1985)(applying  Deblois where  claimant  had\n                                        \n\ncounsel).   See also Basinger v. Heckler, 725 F.2d 1166, 1169\n                                        \n\n(8th Cir.  1984)(collecting cases).   Here,  the ALJ  did not\n\nspecifically  mention  evidence  from the  post-1984  period,\n\nfinding  that   \"no  consideration  must  be   given  to  the\n\nimpairment  as it existed at a time  too far removed from the\n\ndate  when claimant's insured status expired.\"  (Tr. 20).  We\n\ncannot  fault the ALJ for this ruling.  The Appeals Council's\n\nremand order  specifically directed  the ALJ to  consider the\n\n1983  reports  of Drs.  Mojica and  Freese  in issuing  a new\n\ndecision.   With the exception  of Dr. Garcia's  PRTF - which\n\nfound that  claimant's anxiety  disorder was not  even severe\n\nduring  the insured  period  - the  evidence generated  after\n\nclaimant's insured status expired did not  address claimant's\n\ncondition before June 1983.  Rather, the medical evidence and\n\nSSA evaluations addressed claimant's condition as of the time\n\nhe  was examined.  Thus, the ALJ  did not err in declining to\n\nreview evidence too remote in time from the insured period to\n\nbe probative  of claimant's  condition before June  1983. Cf.\n                                                             \n\nTremblay v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 676  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n11, 13 (1st Cir. 1982)(ALJ had no obligation to refer medical\n\nrecords from  period after claimant's  insured status expired\n\nto medical advisor).  \n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\n     Substantial  evidence supports the ALJ's conclusion that\n\nclaimant was  not  disabled from  his  past work  before  his\n\ninsured status  expired.   The medical evidence  through 1984\n\ndisclosed  a  mild  to  moderate anxiety  disorder  that  was\n\nmanaged  by medications.14   There  is a  significant gap  in\n\ntreatment between  1979 and 1981, during  which time claimant\n\nworked.    After filing  for  benefits  and securing  further\n\ntreatment in 1982,  claimant again stopped treatment  between\n\nMay 1983 and October 1984  to care for his sick mother.  Such\n\nactivity  tends  to  support  the  conclusion  that  claimant\n\nretained the capacity  to work.  Dr. Nogueras  had previously\n\ntestified that claimant remained capable of performing simple\n\nrepetitive tasks  even when the more dire  evidence from 1985\n\nonward was taken  into account.  (Tr. 67-68).   The ALJ could\n\nreasonably  conclude  that  claimant retained  this  capacity\n\nbefore June 1983.     \n\n     Claimant argues that a vocational expert was required to\n\nexplain how his severe mental impairment affected his ability\n\nto sustain gainful employment.   While this might be true had\n\n                    \n\n14.  The ALJ  relied on Dr. Nogueras'  testimony in rejecting\nDr. Bravo's schizophrenia diagnosis.  Dr. Nogueras discounted\nschizophrenia because the mental  health clinic then treating\nclaimant did not make this diagnosis and because the  medical\nrecords did  not reveal persistent psychotic  symptoms.  (Tr.\n62,  104).    Dr.  Nogueras opined  that  claimant's  alleged\nhallucinations  were more likely  due to  alcohol withdrawal.\nSuch  conflicts in  the  evidence are  for  the Secretary  to\nresolve.   Lizotte v. Secretary of Health and Human Services,\n                                                            \n654 F.2d 127, 128 (1st Cir. 1981)(citation omitted).      \n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nthe ALJ determined that claimant could  no longer perform his\n\npast  work, see, e.g., Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human\n                                                             \n\nServices,  890  F.2d 520,  524  (1st  Cir. 1989)(noting  that\n        \n\nvocational  expert  typically  required  where  nonexertional\n\nimpairment significantly limits claimant's ability to perform\n\njobs he is otherwise exertionally capable of performing),\n\nthat  is not the  case here.   The record supports  the ALJ's\n\nview that claimant retained the capacity to  perform his past\n\nunskilled work  before June 1983.   Further evidence  was not\n\nnecessary.  \n\n     Finally, claimant says  that the fact that he  was fired\n\nfrom  his  past jobs  undermines  the  ALJ's conclusion  that\n\nclaimant remained capable of performing his past work and the\n\nALJ's   subsidiary  finding  that   claimant  never  suffered\n\nepisodes of deterioration or  decompensation in work or work-\n\nlike settings.   The  sole evidence  that claimant was  fired\n\ncame  from  the  claimant  himself, as  he  reported  this to\n\nvarious  medical providers and SSA representatives.  However,\n\nclaimant proved  to be an unreliable  and inconsistent source\n\nof information.   He  identified various dates  of employment\n\nfor  his past work, and alternately reported that he had been\n\nfired  or  quit  his  job  with  the  Department  of  Natural\n\nResources.   Claimant's contention that  he was fired  by the\n\nDepartment of  Natural Resources  in 1978 is  contradicted by\n\nthe  SSA's earnings  record, which  indicated that  he worked\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nuntil September 11, 1981.  (Tr. 298).   The  ALJ did not find\n\nclaimant  wholly  credible.    Absent  evidence corroborating\n\nclaimant's assertions  from the  relevant time, we  think the\n\nALJ's finding may stand. \n\n     Judgment affirmed.\n                       \n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n",

Claimant Ricardo Padilla Perez appeals\n                    \n\na  district  court  judgment  affirming  a  decision  of  the\n\nSecretary  of Health  and  Human Services  denying his  third\n\nclaim for Social Security disability benefits.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     Claimant was  born in Puerto  Rico on February  7, 1940.\n\nHe completed the first grade and is illiterate.  As an adult,\n\nclaimant resided and worked in the mainland United States and\n\nPuerto Rico.  He speaks  some English.  Claimant worked as  a\n\nbookbinder  in the  New York  City area,  a job  that largely\n\nrequired  that  he stand  and  pack  cartons  with books  and\n\noccasionally use  a power  press.   In Puerto  Rico, claimant\n\nworked  as a  road  laborer  for  the Department  of  Natural\n\nResources performing maintenance and cleaning work.\n\n     Claimant   filed   three  applications   for  disability\n\nbenefits based on  an alleged mental  impairment.  The  first\n\nwas filed in  Puerto Rico  on September 2,  1982 and  alleged\n\nthat  claimant had  been unable  to work since  September 11,\n\n1981  due  to  a  nervous  condition.   The  Social  Security\n\nAdministration (SSA)  denied that claim after  initial review\n\nand reconsideration.   The  decision on  reconsideration took\n\nplace in May 1983  and claimant did not seek  further review.\n\nTwo years later, he filed his second application in New York,\n\nagain  alleging September  11,  1981 as  his date  of onset.1\n\n                    \n\n1.  This second application was filed during the grace period\ncreated by  the 1984  Social Security Disability  Reform Act,\nPub. L. 98-460, and entitled claimant to a redetermination of\n\nThat  claim   also  was   denied  upon  initial   review  and\n\nreconsideration.   This  time, claimant  sought review  by an\n\nadministrative  law judge  (ALJ).   After a  full hearing  at\n\nwhich   claimant  and  medical  advisor  Rafael  Nogueras  (a\n\npsychiatrist) testified, the ALJ  ruled that claimant was not\n\ndisabled on  March 27, 1986.   The  Appeals Council  declined\n\nfurther  review, thus  rendering  the  ALJ's decision  final.\n\nClaimant did not seek judicial review.   He immediately filed\n\nhis third  application, which is the subject of this appeal.2\n\n      In contrast  to his  first  two applications,  claimant\n\namended his third application to  allege February 25, 1978 as\n\nhis date  of onset. (Tr. 272).3  The SSA determined that some\n\nof the earnings that had been attributed to claimant when his\n\nprevious  applications  were  processed  were not,  in  fact,\n\nclaimant's earnings.  (Tr. 292, 296).   Consequently, the SSA\n\nredetermined  claimant's insured  status  and found  that  it\n\n                    \n\nthe whole period presented by his earlier claim.  (Tr. 497).\n\n2.  Although  claimant's third  application  alleged  a  back\nimpairment, he indicated that his primary ailment was mental.\nThe sole issue presented in  this appeal is whether  claimant\nwas disabled by his mental impairment.\n\n3.  Claimant filed  a statement in connection  with his third\napplication  wherein  he  alleged  that he  lost  his  Social\nSecurity card in New York and that the earnings that appeared\nin his record after 1978 did not belong to him.  (Tr. 294).  \n\n                             -3-\n\nexpired  on June  30,  1983.   (Tr.  298).4   The SSA  denied\n\nclaimant's third application on the ground of res judicata on\n                                                          \n\ninitial  review,  reconsideration,  and following  a  limited\n\nhearing  by  an  ALJ.5    The  Appeals  Council  vacated this\n\ndecision, finding that the ALJ's  March 1986 decision did not\n\naddress  certain consultative  evaluations from  the pre-June\n\n1983  period.    The   Appeals  Council  directed  the  ALJ's\n\nattention  to these reports and instructed him to issue a new\n\ndecision  after   considering  \"all  pertinent   evidence  of\n\nrecord.\"  (Tr. 504).     A  supplemental  hearing  was  held.\n\nOnce again,  claimant and  Dr. Nogueras testified.   Although\n\nclaimant maintained  that he had  not worked since  1978, the\n\nALJ found that he had earnings in 1980 and 1981  and that the\n\nquestion was whether claimant  was disabled between September\n\n11,  1981 (his previously alleged date of onset) and June 30,\n\n1983 (when his  insured status expired).   The ALJ found that\n\nduring this period, claimant suffered from an anxiety related\n\ndisorder and from alcohol  abuse in remission.  This  finding\n\nwas  based largely on the testimony of Dr. Nogueras. (Tr. 27,\n\n29).   This condition resulted in  only moderate restrictions\n\non  claimant's   activities  of   daily  living   and  social\n\n                    \n\n4.  The SSA's prior denial  assumed that claimant was insured\nthrough September 30, 1987.  (Tr. 250).\n\n5.  We  note that  the ALJ  who adjudicated  claimant's third\napplication  was  not the  same  ALJ  who  denied his  second\napplication.\n\n                             -4-\n\nfunctioning during the  relevant period, and seldom  resulted\n\nin  deficiencies of persistence, concentration or pace.   The\n\nALJ further found that  claimant never suffered from episodes\n\nof deterioration  or  decompensation  in  work  or  work-like\n\nsettings.   (Tr.  20).   Where  the  evidence in  the  record\n\nindicated that claimant's past jobs were unskilled, simple to\n\nperform, and  required no  complex mental functions,  the ALJ\n\nconcluded that claimant's  anxiety disorder did not  preclude\n\nhim from performing his past work before June  30, 1983.  The\n\nAppeals Council declined claimant's request for review,  thus\n\nrendering  this  second ALJ's  decision  final.   (Tr.  5-6).\n\nClaimant sought judicial review under 42 U.S.C.  405(g).  The\n\ndistrict court  adopted the report of a  magistrate judge and\n\nfound  that claimant had failed to prove that he was disabled\n\nbefore June 30, 1983.

It is not enough for\n\nthe claimant  to establish that an  impairment which disabled\n\nhim from  working after his  insured status  expired had  its\n                       \n\nroots before then.  Deblois, 686 F.2d at 79.   While there is\n                           \n\nevidence  indicating  that  claimant's  condition   may  have\n\nreached  disabling severity  after 1986,  on balance,  we are\n\ncompelled  to agree that claimant  has not shown  that he was\n\ndisabled before June 30, 1983.  We review the record. \n\n                        III.                                 \n\n     The  earliest medical  records  indicate  that  claimant\n\nreported  experiencing  nervous  problems  and  daily alcohol\n\nconsumption in  1976 while  securing treatment for  trauma to\n\nhis left  knee.   He did  not seek  treatment for  his nerves\n\n                             -6-\n\nthen. (Tr. 358-59).   He sought  outpatient treatment at  the\n\nClinica Externas  de Adultos on August 20, 1979.  He was then\n\nthirty-nine years old.  He reported  that he had quit his job\n\nwith the Department of  Natural Resources because his \"nerves\n\nbetray[ed]\" him  and he claimed  to have been  unemployed for\n\nover a year.   (Tr. 171).  Mental examination  found claimant\n\ntense and anxious but  approachable, in contact with reality,\n\nand  with \"very acceptable\" judgment.  (Tr. 167).  An anxiety\n\nreaction was diagnosed and claimant was placed on Vistaril (a\n\ntranquilizer).  (Tr. 167).  No  further treatment is reported\n\nfor  approximately  two  years.6     Claimant  consulted  Dr.\n\nFerdinand Berrios  in August  1981 complaining of  chest pain\n\nand  shortness of  breath  associated with  states of  marked\n\nanxiety.  (Tr.  417-27).    Dr. Berrios  diagnosed  a  severe\n\nanxiety  neurosis  with  depressive  traits.   He  prescribed\n\nantianxiety  medications (Adapin  and Vistaril)  and Mellaril\n\n(an  antipsychotic)  and  recommended  that  claimant  obtain\n\npsychiatric treatment.  Claimant sought such treatment at the\n\noutpatient  clinic of  the Bayamon  Regional  Hospital, again\n\ncomplaining  of problems with  his nerves.    At this time it\n\n                    \n\n6.  As noted above, the  SSA's earnings records indicate that\nclaimant worked  during  this two  year period.   (Tr.  296).\nApart from his own statements, claimant submitted no evidence\nto rebut the SSA's earnings record.  We think it a relatively\nsimple matter for claimant's  counsel to secure  verification\nof  claimant's  alleged  dates  of  employment and  departure\ntherefrom.  Absent such evidence, we have no cause to second-\nguess the SSA's findings.     \n\n                             -7-\n\nwas reported that claimant made excessive use of alcohol.  In\n\nSeptember 1981 claimant was diagnosed to be suffering from an\n\nanxiety  reaction with  dissociative  features of  hysterical\n\norigin.   Mellaril and Adapin were continued and  counselling\n\nwas prescribed.   (Tr. 170).   In follow-up  visits over  the\n\nnext seven months claimant reported that the medications were\n\nnot  helping and that he  experienced hallucinations.  Yet in\n\nMay  1982  he  was  relevant, coherent  and  oriented  in all\n\nspheres.   (Tr. 175).  Mellaril was discontinued and Vistaril\n\nrestarted.  (Tr. 176).   \n\n     A  consulting psychiatrist, Dr.  Miguel Bravo, evaluated\n\nclaimant for the SSA on October 15, 1982.  (Tr. 411-13).  Dr.\n\nBravo  interviewed  claimant with  one  of  his cousins,  who\n\nreported that  claimant heard voices and  knocking sounds and\n\ndisappeared  from home  for days  at a  time during  which he\n\nwandered  the neighborhood and  became disoriented.  Claimant\n\nreported  that   he  spent   his  days  walking   around  the\n\nneighborhood,  occasionally  helping   with  the   housework,\n\nwatching T.V. or listening  to the radio.  He related well to\n\nfamily and neighbors  who visited him.  Personal  hygiene was\n\nadequate.     Dr.  Bravo  reported  that   claimant  appeared\n\nanguished during  his mental  examination and that  he cried,\n\nwith thought content centered around his difficulty keeping a\n\njob.    He  expressed  himself  with  difficulty,  exhibiting\n\nthought blocking, flight of ideas and occasional incoherence.\n\n                             -8-\n\nHis  intellect  appeared  below  average and  he  was  easily\n\ndistracted.   He  was disoriented  in  time and  place  while\n\noriented in person.   Memory was deteriorated  for all events\n\nand his  affect was  depressed.   Judgment  and insight  were\n\nnull.     Dr.  Bravo  diagnosed  a  chronic  undifferentiated\n\nschizophrenia and found that claimant was not able  to handle\n\nfunds.7     Shortly after  Dr. Bravo's  evaluation claimant's\n\ninternist (Dr. Berrios)  opined that  claimant was  disabled.\n\n(Tr. 418, 439). \n\n     Claimant was evaluated for  the SSA again in  March 1983\n\nby  another  psychiatrist,   Dr.  Mojica  Sandoz.8     Mental\n\nexamination found claimant  unshaven though clean, exhibiting\n\nslight psychomotor retardation.   He was slightly anxious and\n\ntense, but  accessible, cooperative  and frank.   He  did not\n\nshow   a   significant  impairment   in   his   capacity  for\n\n                    \n\n7.  Another   consultant,  Dr.   Ramon  Freese   Suarez,  (an\ninternist and cardiologist),  evaluated claimant in  November\n1982.   He found  a neuropsychiatric condition,  severe lower\nleg varicosities  and gastritis.   (Tr.  429).   Dr. Freese's\nreport indicates that claimant reported that he had worked in\nseveral factories in  New York but was thrown out of jobs due\nto his nervous  condition.  (Tr. 426).  In  contrast to other\nmedical records, Dr. Freese's  report indicates that claimant\nwas last employed in 1981 by the city of Corazol. (Tr. 426). \n\n8.  Claimant  told Dr.  Mojica that he  had not  worked since\n1977  or  1978,  his last  job  being  with  the Puerto  Rico\nDepartment of  Natural Resources.   He also reported  that he\nwounded  himself with a machete while he was so employed, and\nthat he had  to quit because  his superior did  not want  him\nworking  anymore.  He claimed to have been fired from another\njob as a janitor.  (Tr. 444-45).    \n\n                             -9-\n\nestablishing interpersonal relations.  (Tr. 445).  Though not\n\nspontaneous, claimant was logical, coherent and relevant.  He\n\nexhibited no suicidal or homicidal tendencies nor evidence of\n\nhallucinations.      He  also   did   not  show   personality\n\ndeterioration.     There   was  no   evidence   of  blocking,\n\ndisorganization,  nor  difficulty   in  the  formulation  and\n\nelaboration  of ideas.   Remote memory was spotty, but recent\n\nand  intermediate  memory   were  adequate.     Noting   that\n\nclaimant's  intellectual  functioning  appeared to  be  below\n\naverage,   Dr.   Mojica  diagnosed   an   unspecified  mental\n\nretardation and  dependent personality  disorder.   He  found\n\nclaimant able to handle funds. (Tr. 445-46).\n\n     Claimant  returned to  the outpatient  clinic in  Puerto\n\nRico again on May 5, 1983, at which time he reported that the\n\nmedications were helping him and that he was more calm.  (Tr.\n\n177).   No medical treatment is reported for more than a year\n\nafter claimant's  insured status expired.   Claimant returned\n\nto the outpatient clinic on October 15, 1984, claiming he had\n\nbeen  absent during the interim because he was caring for his\n\nsick  mother.  He appeared clean, anxious and oriented in all\n\nspheres. (Tr. 179).  His  memory and intellect were adequate,\n\nalthough  judgment and insight were poor.  A mild to moderate\n\nanxiety  disorder  was  diagnosed  and  Vistaril   was  again\n\nprescribed.  (Tr. 179-80).   An individualized treatment plan\n\ndated November 28, 1984 described claimant's anxiety disorder\n\n                             -10-\n\nas  chronic  and mild,  while  indicating  that claimant  had\n\nexhibited good adaptation over the last year.  (Tr. 181-184).\n\nA February 15, 1985 treatment  summary from the Mental Health\n\nCenter indicated that  claimant then had  a mild to  moderate\n\nanxiety disorder and was partially  limited in his ability to\n\ndo his usual work.  (Tr. 190-91).\n\n     The medical evidence following  claimant's return to New\n\nYork in  March 1985 suggests that  his condition periodically\n\nbecame more  dire.  After  filing his second  application for\n\ndisability  benefits, claimant allegedly began suffering from\n\nhallucinations   and  tried   to  kill   himself.     He  was\n\nhospitalized at  the South  Beach Psychiatric Center  between\n\nMay 17-25 and diagnosed  with an atypical psychosis.   A long\n\nhistory of alcohol abuse was identified, including blackouts,\n\ndelirium tremens  and one  prior suicide attempt.9   Claimant\n\nwas treated with Haldol (an antipsychotic)  and psychotherapy\n\nand  referred  to  Alcoholics  Anonymous.    (Tr.   199-206).\n\nShortly after his discharge  from the South Beach Psychiatric\n\nCenter claimant was  evaluated for  the SSA by  Dr. J.  Fiks.\n\nClaimant   appeared   manipulative,  demanding,   and  vague,\n\nexhibiting a  tendency to overreact  and exaggerate.   He was\n\nable to  provide information to suit his  needs but otherwise\n\nnoncommittal.  His reliability was  poor.  Dr. Fiks diagnosed\n\n                    \n\n9.  Claimant reported that he  had stopped drinking one month\nbefore his admission.  (Tr. 199).\n\n                             -11-\n\na  passive-aggressive  personality  disorder  and  questioned\n\nclaimant's ability to handle funds.  (Tr. 207-08).   \n\n     Claimant  secured further  treatment  from the  New York\n\nOffice of Mental  Health.10   He appeared to  improve in  the\n\nfall  of  1985  and remained  asymptomatic  despite decreased\n\nmedications.  At that time, claimant again was caring for his\n\nmother, who had had  surgery.  Another psychiatric evaluation\n\nfrom November 1985 indicated that claimant could not tolerate\n\nthe  pressure of  a  competitive  work  setting  due  to  the\n\nlikleihood of decompensating under stress.  (Tr. 212).  \n\n     The  SSA obtained  two assessments of  claimant's mental\n\nresidual  functional  capacity  (RFC) from  two  nonexamining\n\nconsultants.  On July  17, 1985, Dr. Alan Kaye  reported that\n\nclaimant  was limited  only  in his  capacity to  understand,\n\nremember and carry out technical job instructions.  He opined\n\nthat claimant  was capable  of work.   (Tr.  143,  146).   On\n\nDecember 16, 1985, Dr. A. Stockton reported that claimant was\n\nmoderately limited in  his abilities to  understand, remember\n\nand  carry  out  detailed  instructions,  interact  with  the\n\ngeneral  public, accept  instructions and  criticism, and  to\n\nrespond  to changes  in the  work setting  and set  realistic\n\ngoals.  (Tr.  148-50).  No other significant limitations were\n\nnoted.\n\n                    \n\n10.  Claimant also had surgery for varicose veins in his legs\nin June 1985.  (Tr. 233). \n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n     Claimant returned to Puerto  Rico in January 1986, where\n\nhis  second  application was  denied.    On  August 2,  1986,\n\nclaimant was evaluated by Dr. Cordero Alonso, a psychiatrist,\n\nin connection  with his third application (Tr.  458-63).  Dr.\n\nCordero  diagnosed a  schizophrenic syndrome  with histrionic\n\nfeatures.  He found claimant unable to handle funds.  Another\n\npsychiatrist, Dr.  Lopez Flores, evaluated claimant  on March\n\n7, 1987.  He diagnosed  a moderate severe dysthymic  disorder\n\nwith  agitation and  psychotic traits.  (Tr. 467-68).11   Two\n\nnonexamining consultants  made RFC  assessments.  On  May 15,\n\n1987,  psychologist  Orlando  Reboredo  found  that  claimant\n\nsuffered  from recurrent  major depression  with  anxiety and\n\npsychotic  episodes.   He found claimant  was not  capable of\n                                                 \n\nwork and that  his condition  met listing 12.04.   (Tr.  335-\n\n43).12   However, Dr. Reboredo was not  asked to focus on the\n\n                    \n\n11.  In  this interview,  claimant reported  that he  had not\nworked  since 1977 and that he had always had mental problems\nbut  that these were exacerbated after a sister died in 1985.\nClaimant  was then  being  treated with  Halcion (a  sleeping\npill)  and  Mellaril.    Claimant denied  using  alcohol  and\nreported  that his  mother  was insane.   Mental  examination\nfound  claimant  to   be  logical,  coherent  and   relevant,\nperception unstable, affect sad, and his mood was anxious and\ndepressed.   His concentration and attention  span were below\npar.  He   was  oriented   only  in  person,   and  exhibited\nsignificant  memory defects.  Judgment  lacked insight.  (Tr.\n468).\n\n12.  Dr.  Reboredo  indicated  that  claimant  suffered  from\nmarked  restrictions of  his activities  of daily  living and\ndifficulties  maintaining  social functioning,  with frequent\ndeficiencies of concentration, persistence  and pace, and one\nor two episodes of deterioration or decompensation in work or\nwork-like settings.   \n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nperiod  between 1978  and  1983.   Another psychologist,  Dr.\n\nPedro  Ivan Garcia, reviewed the evidence with a specific eye\n\nto evaluating claimant's condition before his insured  status\n\nexpired  on June 30, 1983.   He indicated  that that evidence\n\npointed  to a nonsevere anxiety disorder that did not meet or\n\nequal a listing. (Tr. 344, 346).13\n\n                             IV.\n\n     On appeal,  claimant argues  that the SSA's  decision is\n\nnot supported  by substantial  evidence on  the  record as  a\n\nwhole  because the  Secretary  relied on  isolated statements\n\nsupporting   a  non-disabled  finding   while  ignoring  what\n\nclaimant  says is  \"overwhelming evidence\"  to  the contrary.\n\nThe  argument overlooks  the fact that  most of  the evidence\n\nthat might  support a  disabled finding  was from  the period\n\nafter claimant's insured  status expired.   Medical  evidence\n\ngenerated after  a claimant's  insured status expires  may be\n\nconsidered for what light  (if any) it sheds on  the question\n\nwhether  claimant's  impairment  reached  disabling  severity\n\nbefore his insured status  expired.  See, e.g.,  Deblois, 686\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at 81 (holding ALJ should have asked consulting experts\n\nwhether pro se claimant's mental impairment reached disabling\n              \n\n                    \n\n13.  Dr.  Ivan  Garcia  noted  only   slight  restriction  of\nclaimant's  activities  of  daily  living   and  difficulties\nmaintaining  social functioning.   He reported  that claimant\nseldom experienced deficiencies of persistence, concentration\nor  pace,  and  that  he  never  suffered  from  episodes  of\ndeterioration in work  or work-like settings.

Here,  the ALJ  did not\n\nspecifically  mention  evidence  from the  post-1984  period,\n\nfinding  that   \"no  consideration  must  be   given  to  the\n\nimpairment  as it existed at a time  too far removed from the\n\ndate  when claimant's insured status expired.\"  (Tr. 20).  We\n\ncannot  fault the ALJ for this ruling.  The Appeals Council's\n\nremand order  specifically directed  the ALJ to  consider the\n\n1983  reports  of Drs.  Mojica and  Freese  in issuing  a new\n\ndecision.   With the exception  of Dr. Garcia's  PRTF - which\n\nfound that  claimant's anxiety  disorder was not  even severe\n\nduring  the insured  period  - the  evidence generated  after\n\nclaimant's insured status expired did not  address claimant's\n\ncondition before June 1983.  Rather, the medical evidence and\n\nSSA evaluations addressed claimant's condition as of the time\n\nhe  was examined.  Thus, the ALJ  did not err in declining to\n\nreview evidence too remote in time from the insured period to\n\nbe probative  of claimant's  condition before June  1983.

Secretary of Health and Human Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"402520\"><a href=\"/opinion/402520/lucienne-j-tremblay-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n                                                  \n\n<span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 (1st Cir. 1982)(ALJ had no obligation to refer medical\n\nrecords from  period after claimant's  insured status expired\n\nto medical advisor).  \n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\n     Substantial  evidence supports the ALJ's conclusion that\n\nclaimant was  not  disabled from  his  past work  before  his\n\ninsured status  expired.   The medical evidence  through 1984\n\ndisclosed  a  mild  to  moderate anxiety  disorder  that  was\n\nmanaged  by medications.14   There  is a  significant gap  in\n\ntreatment between  1979 and 1981, during  which time claimant\n\nworked.    After filing  for  benefits  and securing  further\n\ntreatment in 1982,  claimant again stopped treatment  between\n\nMay 1983 and October 1984  to care for his sick mother.  Such\n\nactivity  tends  to  support  the  conclusion  that  claimant\n\nretained the capacity  to work.  Dr. Nogueras  had previously\n\ntestified that claimant remained capable of performing simple\n\nrepetitive tasks  even when the more dire  evidence from 1985\n\nonward was taken  into account.  (Tr. 67-68).   The ALJ could\n\nreasonably  conclude  that  claimant retained  this  capacity\n\nbefore June 1983.     \n\n     Claimant argues that a vocational expert was required to\n\nexplain how his severe mental impairment affected his ability\n\nto sustain gainful employment.   While this might be true had\n\n                    \n\n14.  The ALJ  relied on Dr. Nogueras'  testimony in rejecting\nDr. Bravo's schizophrenia diagnosis.  Dr. Nogueras discounted\nschizophrenia because the mental  health clinic then treating\nclaimant did not make this diagnosis and because the  medical\nrecords did  not reveal persistent psychotic  symptoms.  (Tr.\n62,  104).    Dr.  Nogueras opined  that  claimant's  alleged\nhallucinations  were more likely  due to  alcohol withdrawal.\nSuch  conflicts in  the  evidence are  for  the Secretary  to\nresolve.   Lizotte v. Secretary of Health and Human Services,\n                                                            \n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"392284\"><a href=\"/opinion/392284/edmond-p-lizotte-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">654</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 128 (1st Cir. 1981)(citation omitted).      \n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nthe ALJ determined that claimant could  no longer perform his\n\npast  work, see, e.g., Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human\n                                                             \n\nServices,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532750\"><a href=\"/opinion/532750/28-socsecrepser-3-unemplinsrep-cch-15109a-victor-m-ortiz-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  524  (1st  Cir. 1989)(noting  that\n        \n\nvocational  expert  typically  required  where  nonexertional\n\nimpairment significantly limits claimant's ability to perform\n\njobs he is otherwise exertionally capable of performing),\n\nthat  is not the  case here.   The record supports  the ALJ's\n\nview that claimant retained the capacity to  perform his past\n\nunskilled work  before June 1983.   Further evidence  was not\n\nnecessary.  \n\n     Finally, claimant says  that the fact that he  was fired\n\nfrom  his  past jobs  undermines  the  ALJ's conclusion  that\n\nclaimant remained capable of performing his past work and the\n\nALJ's   subsidiary  finding  that   claimant  never  suffered\n\nepisodes of deterioration or  decompensation in work or work-\n\nlike settings.   The  sole evidence  that claimant was  fired\n\ncame  from  the  claimant  himself, as  he  reported  this to\n\nvarious  medical providers and SSA representatives.  However,\n\nclaimant proved  to be an unreliable  and inconsistent source\n\nof information.   He  identified various dates  of employment\n\nfor  his past work, and alternately reported that he had been\n\nfired  or  quit  his  job  with  the  Department  of  Natural\n\nResources.   Claimant's contention that  he was fired  by the\n\nDepartment of  Natural Resources  in 1978 is  contradicted by\n\nthe  SSA's earnings  record, which  indicated that  he worked\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nuntil September 11, 1981.  (Tr. 298).   The  ALJ did not find\n\nclaimant  wholly  credible.    Absent  evidence corroborating\n\nclaimant's assertions  from the  relevant time, we  think the\n\nALJ's finding may stand. \n\n     Judgment affirmed.\n                       \n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n</pre>",
