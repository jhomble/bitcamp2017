The United States District\n                               \n\nCourt   for  the  District  of  Puerto  Rico  dismissed  the\n\nplaintiffs' diversity tort  suit on two  grounds:  (1)  that\n\nthe Puerto Rico  statute of limitations barred  the suit and\n\n(2)  that dismissal  was  warranted because  of  one of  the\n\nplaintiffs'  repeated  failures to  comply with  the court's\n\npretrial orders.  We affirm the dismissal on the limitations\n\nground  and, therefore,  find it  unnecessary  to reach  the\n\nsecond ground.\n\n                             I\n\n          On  April 4, 1991, the plaintiffs, Mr. Bonilla and\n\nhis wife,  filed a  diversity  action in  the United  States\n\nDistrict Court for  the District of Puerto  Rico against the\n\ndefendants.  The complaint alleged that on February 5, 1990,\n\nwhile  Mr. Bonilla was a guest  at the Sands Hotel in Puerto\n\nRico and as a result  of the hotel's negligence, he suffered\n\nvarious  injuries when  he was  struck  in the  head with  a\n\nvolleyball while in the Jacuzzi area.   The complaint sought\n\ndamages of $1,450,000.00.\n\n          More than  16  months  later,  following  repeated\n\nfailures  of Mr.  Bonilla to  comply  with various  pretrial\n\n(including discovery) orders of the court, the court granted\n\nthe  defendants' motion  for summary judgment  and dismissed\n\n                           - 2 -\n\nthe complaint.  The court held:  (1) that Puerto Rico's one-\n\nyear tort statute of limitations  barred the suit, since (a)\n\nthe suit  was filed 14  months after the alleged  injury and\n\n(b) Mr.  Bonilla had  not established  any of  the statutory\n\ngrounds for tolling the statute; and (2) that  dismissal \"is\n\nalso  based  on  plaintiff's failure  to  comply  with court\n\norders.\"  \n\n                             II\n\n          As  noted, Puerto Rico  has a one-year  statute of\n\nlimitations for all tort actions.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  \n\n5298(2) (1991).   Since  the complaint  was filed  14 months\n\nafter Mr.  Bonilla allegedly  was  injured, on  its face  it\n\nappears untimely under the statute.\n\n          Puerto Rico, however, has a tolling  statute which\n\nprovides:\n\n               Prescription  of   actions  is\n               interrupted      by      their\n               institution before the courts,\n               by extrajudicial claim  of the\n               creditor,  and by  any act  of\n               acknowledgment of the  debt by\n               the debtor.\n\nId.   5303 (1991).\n   \n\n          The  plaintiffs here contend,  as they did  in the\n\ndistrict  court,  that  three  letters  tolled  the statute.\n\nThese letters  were referenced  and  apparently attached  to\n\n                           - 3 -\n\nmotions  the   plaintiffs  filed,  but   the  letters  were,\n\nnevertheless, not  part of  the record  before the  district\n\ncourt.   The  court rejected the  tolling contention  on the\n\nfollowing ground:\n\n               Defendants have shown that the\n               action was filed more than one\n               year   after   the    incident\n               occurred.   Plaintiff, as  the\n               non-moving  party,   must  now\n               produce evidence to  create an\n               issue  of fact  as to  whether\n               the statute of limitations was\n               tolled  or  not.     Plaintiff\n               alludes  to   letters  stating\n               extrajudicial claims  which he\n               states   were   sent   to  the\n               defendant.   However, none  of\n               these letters are  included in\n               the  record.    Without  these\n               letters,  which  we   need  in\n               order to determine  whether or\n               not the statute of limitations\n               was tolled  under Puerto  Rico\n               law, we  cannot proceed.   We,\n               therefore,  grant  defendants'\n               summary     judgment    motion\n               because  plaintiff has  failed\n               to  fulfill   his  burden   of\n               production.\n\n          Since the  plaintiffs have  the burden  to support\n\ntheir  claim that the  statute was tolled,  their failure to\n\nintroduce into the record the  letters upon which they based\n\nthat claim was  fatal to the claim.   See Mesnick v. General\n                                                            \n\nElec.  Co., 950  F.2d 816,  822  (1st Cir.  1991) (when  the\n          \n\nmoving party  has made  a showing that  no genuine  issue of\n\n                           - 4 -\n\nmaterial fact is at issue and the nonmoving party \"bears the\n\nultimate  burden  of   proof,  he  must   present  definite,\n\ncompetent  evidence  to  rebut   the  motion\"  for   summary\n\njudgment),  cert.  denied, 112  S.  Ct.  2965 (1992).    The\n                         \n\ndistrict court, therefore, justifiably rejected the  tolling\n\ncontention for  lack of supporting  proof.  Fed. R.  Civ. P.\n\n56(c) (\"The judgment  sought shall be rendered  forthwith if\n\nthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,  and\n\nadmissions on file . . . show that there is no genuine issue\n\nas  to  any material  fact  and  that  the moving  party  is\n\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\").  \n\n          In  any  event,  the letters  do  not  support the\n\ntolling contention.\n\n          The  first and third  letters were written  by the\n\ninsurance  representative of  the Sands  Hotel  and did  not\n\nadmit liability.    They, therefore,  were  not an  \"act  of\n\nacknowledgment of  the debt  by the  debtor.\"   Indeed,  the\n\nplaintiffs apparently do not claim to the contrary.\n\n          The  plaintiffs  rely   upon  the  second  letter,\n\nwritten   by   Mr.  Bonilla's   lawyer   to   the  insurance\n\nrepresentative in  response  to the  latter's first  letter,\n\nwhich  had  sought  certain  information  from  Mr.  Bonilla\n\n                           - 5 -\n\nregarding the alleged accident.  The only possibly pertinent\n\nportion of Mr. Bonilla's letter stated:\n\n               I  would  appreciate  that you\n               send me information  about the\n               coverage of the  policy Sand's\n               Hotel  have  [sic]  for  cases\n               like this and also if you have\n               any  representative in  Puerto\n               Rico with whom  we can discuss\n               and try to settle this case.\n\n          The   plaintiffs  contend   that  this   statement\n\nconstituted an  \"extrajudicial claim of the  creditor\" under\n\nthe tolling statute.\n\n          As  this court  has noted,  the  Supreme Court  of\n\nPuerto  Rico \"has  stated that  an  extrajudicial claim,  in\n\norder  to  have   tolling  effect,  must  be   'precise  and\n\nspecific.'    Jimenez v.  District Court,  65 P.R.R.  35, 42\n                                        \n\n(1945).\"  Gual Morales v.  Hernandez Vega, 604 F.2d 730, 733\n                                         \n\n(1st  Cir.  1979).   In  Pacheco  v. National  Western  Life\n                                                            \n\nInsurance Co.,  640 F.  Supp.  900, 905  (D.P.R. 1986),  the\n             \n\ncourt  ruled that  a letter  was  sufficiently \"precise  and\n\nspecific\" so as to toll the limitations period where\n\n          [t]he letter  makes a  clear and  direct\n          reference to [the] Law . . . under which\n          the  present  action  is brought.    The\n          letter  describes  plaintiff's  services\n          clearly falling within the shield of the\n          [relevant] law.   The mention of amounts\n          of  money owed  and plaintiff's  warning\n          that  his  lawyers were  being  notified\n          lead us to  conclude that a claim  under\n\n                           - 6 -\n\n          [the particular law  at issue] was being\n          made through  this letter  and that  the\n          letter in  fact makes  a  claim for  the\n          relief ultimately sought.\n\nId.  (footnote omitted).    On  the  other  hand,  we  ruled\n   \n\ninsufficient  for tolling,  a  letter that  \"specified  what\n\nplaintiffs were requesting, but did not give specific notice\n\nof the basis of the  lawsuit,\" and a second letter in  which\n\nthe   plaintiff  merely  stated  his  intention  to  file  a\n\ncomplaint  against the defendant.

We\n            \n\nconcluded that neither  of those letters were  sufficient to\n\nalert the defendant to the specific causes of action against\n\nwhich it would be forced to defend itself.

The United States District\n                               \n\nCourt   for  the  District  of  Puerto  Rico  dismissed  the\n\nplaintiffs' diversity tort  suit on two  grounds:  (1)  that\n\nthe Puerto Rico  statute of limitations barred  the suit and\n\n(2)  that dismissal  was  warranted because  of  one of  the\n\nplaintiffs'  repeated  failures to  comply with  the court's\n\npretrial orders.  We affirm the dismissal on the limitations\n\nground  and, therefore,  find it  unnecessary  to reach  the\n\nsecond ground.\n\n                             I\n\n          On  April 4, 1991, the plaintiffs, Mr. Bonilla and\n\nhis wife,  filed a  diversity  action in  the United  States\n\nDistrict Court for  the District of Puerto  Rico against the\n\ndefendants.  The complaint alleged that on February 5, 1990,\n\nwhile  Mr. Bonilla was a guest  at the Sands Hotel in Puerto\n\nRico and as a result  of the hotel's negligence, he suffered\n\nvarious  injuries when  he was  struck  in the  head with  a\n\nvolleyball while in the Jacuzzi area.   The complaint sought\n\ndamages of $1,450,000.00.\n\n          More than  16  months  later,  following  repeated\n\nfailures  of Mr.  Bonilla to  comply  with various  pretrial\n\n(including discovery) orders of the court, the court granted\n\nthe  defendants' motion  for summary judgment  and dismissed\n\n                           - 2 -\n\nthe complaint.  The court held:  (1) that Puerto Rico's one-\n\nyear tort statute of limitations  barred the suit, since (a)\n\nthe suit  was filed 14  months after the alleged  injury and\n\n(b) Mr.  Bonilla had  not established  any of  the statutory\n\ngrounds for tolling the statute; and (2) that  dismissal \"is\n\nalso  based  on  plaintiff's failure  to  comply  with court\n\norders.\"  \n\n                             II\n\n          As  noted, Puerto Rico  has a one-year  statute of\n\nlimitations for all tort actions.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  \n\n5298(2) (1991).   Since  the complaint  was filed  14 months\n\nafter Mr.  Bonilla allegedly  was  injured, on  its face  it\n\nappears untimely under the statute.\n\n          Puerto Rico, however, has a tolling  statute which\n\nprovides:\n\n               Prescription  of   actions  is\n               interrupted      by      their\n               institution before the courts,\n               by extrajudicial claim  of the\n               creditor,  and by  any act  of\n               acknowledgment of the  debt by\n               the debtor.\n\nId.   5303 (1991).\n   \n\n          The  plaintiffs here contend,  as they did  in the\n\ndistrict  court,  that  three  letters  tolled  the statute.\n\nThese letters  were referenced  and  apparently attached  to\n\n                           - 3 -\n\nmotions  the   plaintiffs  filed,  but   the  letters  were,\n\nnevertheless, not  part of  the record  before the  district\n\ncourt.   The  court rejected the  tolling contention  on the\n\nfollowing ground:\n\n               Defendants have shown that the\n               action was filed more than one\n               year   after   the    incident\n               occurred.   Plaintiff, as  the\n               non-moving  party,   must  now\n               produce evidence to  create an\n               issue  of fact  as to  whether\n               the statute of limitations was\n               tolled  or  not.     Plaintiff\n               alludes  to   letters  stating\n               extrajudicial claims  which he\n               states   were   sent   to  the\n               defendant.   However, none  of\n               these letters are  included in\n               the  record.    Without  these\n               letters,  which  we   need  in\n               order to determine  whether or\n               not the statute of limitations\n               was tolled  under Puerto  Rico\n               law, we  cannot proceed.   We,\n               therefore,  grant  defendants'\n               summary     judgment    motion\n               because  plaintiff has  failed\n               to  fulfill   his  burden   of\n               production.\n\n          Since the  plaintiffs have  the burden  to support\n\ntheir  claim that the  statute was tolled,  their failure to\n\nintroduce into the record the  letters upon which they based\n\nthat claim was  fatal to the claim.   See Mesnick v. General\n                                                            \n\nElec.

Ct.  2965 (1992).    The\n                         \n\ndistrict court, therefore, justifiably rejected the  tolling\n\ncontention for  lack of supporting  proof.  Fed. R.  Civ.

They, therefore,  were  not an  \"act  of\n\nacknowledgment of  the debt  by the  debtor.\"   Indeed,  the\n\nplaintiffs apparently do not claim to the contrary.\n\n          The  plaintiffs  rely   upon  the  second  letter,\n\nwritten   by   Mr.  Bonilla's   lawyer   to   the  insurance\n\nrepresentative in  response  to the  latter's first  letter,\n\nwhich  had  sought  certain  information  from  Mr.  Bonilla\n\n                           - 5 -\n\nregarding the alleged accident.  The only possibly pertinent\n\nportion of Mr. Bonilla's letter stated:\n\n               I  would  appreciate  that you\n               send me information  about the\n               coverage of the  policy Sand's\n               Hotel  have  [sic]  for  cases\n               like this and also if you have\n               any  representative in  Puerto\n               Rico with whom  we can discuss\n               and try to settle this case.\n\n          The   plaintiffs  contend   that  this   statement\n\nconstituted an  \"extrajudicial claim of the  creditor\" under\n\nthe tolling statute.\n\n          As  this court  has noted,  the  Supreme Court  of\n\nPuerto  Rico \"has  stated that  an  extrajudicial claim,  in\n\norder  to  have   tolling  effect,  must  be   'precise  and\n\nspecific.'

In  Pacheco  v. National  Western  Life\n                                                            \n\nInsurance Co.,  640 F.  Supp.  900, 905  (D.P.R. 1986),  the\n             \n\ncourt  ruled that  a letter  was  sufficiently \"precise  and\n\nspecific\" so as to toll the limitations period where\n\n          [t]he letter  makes a  clear and  direct\n          reference to [the] Law . . . under which\n          the  present  action  is brought.    The\n          letter  describes  plaintiff's  services\n          clearly falling within the shield of the\n          [relevant] law.   The mention of amounts\n          of  money owed  and plaintiff's  warning\n          that  his  lawyers were  being  notified\n          lead us to  conclude that a claim  under\n\n                           - 6 -\n\n          [the particular law  at issue] was being\n          made through  this letter  and that  the\n          letter in  fact makes  a  claim for  the\n          relief ultimately sought.\n\nId.  (footnote omitted).    On  the  other  hand,  we  ruled\n   \n\ninsufficient  for tolling,  a  letter that  \"specified  what\n\nplaintiffs were requesting, but did not give specific notice\n\nof the basis of the  lawsuit,\" and a second letter in  which\n\nthe   plaintiff  merely  stated  his  intention  to  file  a\n\ncomplaint  against the defendant.
