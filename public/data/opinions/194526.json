In this  case the district court\n                          \n\ndismissed  a suit brought under the Bank Holding Company Act,\n\n12 U.S.C.    1972, on  the ground that  it was barred  by res\n                                                             \n\njudicata.   The prior litigation, held to bar the new federal\n        \n\naction, was a state-court suit brought by the same plaintiffs\n\nagainst  the same  defendants  and decided  in  favor of  the\n\nlatter.   The disappointed  plaintiffs now appeal,  urging on\n\nseveral grounds  that res  judicata does not  properly apply.\n                                   \n\nIn full  agreement with  the district  court,  we affirm  its\n\ndecision.\n\n     The procedural history  of the two cases is  complex and\n\nintertwined but a  brief summary will suffice  at the outset.\n\nDiversified  Foods, Inc.,  and its  operating subsidiary  New\n\nEngland Sales,  Inc.  (collectively, \"the  borrowers\"),  were\n\nengaged in  a specialized  form of wholesale  distribution of\n\ngoods.   In  financing  their activities,  they entered  into\n\nvarious borrowing  arrangements with First  National Bank  of\n\nBoston   and  its   Maine  subsidiary  Casco   Northern  Bank\n\n(collectively, \"the  banks\").  The arrangements,  at least in\n\nthe  borrowers'  view,  contained  terms   restricting  their\n\nability to obtain alternative sources of financing.\n\n     During 1988, the borrowers  first sought to expand their\n\nbusiness and then suffered large losses.  They attribute this\n\nreversal  of fortune to the  failure of the  banks to provide\n\nadequate credit under  the borrowing arrangements.   Claiming\n\n                             -2-\n\nmultimillion  dollar  damages, the  borrowers  on  August 21,\n\n1989, brought suit against the banks in Maine Superior Court,\n\nasserting various  state-law tort  and contract claims.   The\n\ncomplaint, as later amended in 1990, included the charge that\n\nthe  banks violated  an  implied covenant  of  good faith  by\n\nimposing  \"unreasonable restrictions  so  as  to prevent  the\n\n[borrowers] from obtaining alternative financing.\"  Discovery\n\nin the state case proceeded during 1989 and 1990.\n\n     On  September  14,  1990,   while  the  state  case  was\n\nproceeding, the borrowers brought the present action  against\n\nthe  banks based  on the  anti-tying  provisions of  the Bank\n\nHolding  Company Act, 12 U.S.C.    1972(1).   The new federal\n\nclaims  were  based,  it  appears,  on  information  obtained\n\nthrough  discovery in the state case.  The borrowers say that\n\nthe  new claims  were  asserted in  a  separate action  in  a\n\ndifferent  court because at that  time the borrowers held the\n\nview (contrary to two  circuit decisions) that federal courts\n\nhave exclusive jurisdiction over claims under section 1972.1\n\n                    \n\n     1Two  weeks before  filing  the  federal complaint,  the\nborrowers moved to amend their state complaint to charge that\nthe  banks  had  breached  their   duty  of  good  faith   by\n\"unreasonable, illegal, and anticompetitive\"  restrictions on\nalternative financing.   Shortly after the federal  complaint\nwas filed, the banks  opposed the state amendment.   When the\nborrowers responded  that the  federal claims were  not being\nasserted  in the  state  case, the  state  court allowed  the\namendment,     striking     the    words     \"illegal\"    and\n\"anticompetitive.\"\n\n                             -3-\n\n     When the banks answered the federal complaint on October\n\n24, 1990, they included  as a defense the assertion  that the\n\nborrowers  \"have improperly  split  their causes  of  action,\n\nhaving  previously filed  in another court  another complaint\n\narising   out  of   the   same  transaction   or  series   of\n\ntransactions.\"  Thereafter, the banks resisted the borrowers'\n\nefforts in January  1991 to introduce  the state claims  into\n\nthe federal action by amendment  of the federal complaint  or\n\nto delay the state proceedings.  The banks  did agree to have\n\ndiscovery in either case treated as if taken in both.\n\n     On  April 18,  1991,  the Maine  Superior Court  granted\n\nsummary  judgment in  favor of  the banks,  a decision  later\n\naffirmed on  appeal.  Diversified Foods, Inc.  v. First Nat'l\n                                                             \n\nBank, 605  A.2d 609  (Me. 1992).   The  banks then  moved for\n    \n\nsummary  judgment in  the  federal action  on grounds  of res\n                                                             \n\njudicata,  and  the  district  court granted  the  motion  on\n        \n\nJanuary  9,  1992.   A belated  attempt  by the  borrowers to\n\nreopen  the state case to add the federal claims was rejected\n\nby  the state  court, and  this action  was also  affirmed on\n\nappeal.  Id.  The  borrowers then pursued this appeal in  the\n           \n\nfederal case.\n\n     In  this court  the borrowers  first argue  that federal\n\ncourts have exclusive jurisdiction over claims under the Bank\n\nHolding Company Act's anti-tying provisions.  Therefore, they\n\nargue,  res judicata  cannot properly  derive from  the state\n                    \n\n                             -4-\n\ncourt  judgment  because they  could  not  have included  the\n\nfederal  claims  in their  state case.    We need  not decide\n\nwhether  the  conclusion would  follow  if  the premise  were\n\nsound, for the premise  is mistaken.  We follow  two circuits\n\nand  several  other courts  that  uniformly  hold that  state\n\ntribunals  have  concurrent  jurisdiction over  section  1972\n\nclaims.  Cuervo  Resources, Inc. v. Claydesta Nat'l Bank, 876\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 436 (5th  Cir. 1989);  Lane v. Central  Bank, N.A.,  756\n                                                      \n\nF.2d 814 (11th Cir. 1985).2  \n\n     The  Bank  Holding  Company  Act  provides  that  anyone\n\ninjured  by a  violation  of section  1972  may sue  \"in  any\n\ndistrict court  of the  United States,\" admittedly  making no\n\nreference to state courts.  12 U.S.C.   1975.  But it is  now\n\nsettled that  there is a  presumption in favor  of concurrent\n\njurisdiction,  so  that state  courts  may  entertain federal\n\ncivil  claims  as a  matter  of course  \"absent  provision by\n\nCongress  to  the  contrary  or   disabling  incompatibility\"\n\nbetween the federal claim and state court jurisdiction.  Gulf\n                                                             \n\nOffshore  Co. v.  Mobil  Oil Corp.,  453  U.S. 473,    477-78\n                                 \n\n(1981).   Here  there  is  no  explicit  bar  to  state-court\n\njurisdiction  and the  subject  matter is  hardly beyond  the\n\n                    \n\n     2Several state courts have reached the  same conclusion.\nSee  United Central Bank, N.A. v. Kruse, 439 N.W.2d 849 (Iowa\n                                       \n1989); Waite v. Banctexas-Houston, N.A., 792 S.W.2d 538 (Tex.\n                                      \nCt. App. 1990).\n\n                             -5-\n\ncompetence of state  courts, which routinely consider  claims\n\nunder their own antitrust laws.\n\n     Of course,  the resemblance  to antitrust law  cuts both\n\nways,  providing the  borrowers' best argument  for exclusive\n\nfederal jurisdiction.   Section 1972 is a  blunter version of\n\nsection  3  of the  Clayton  Act, 15  U.S.C.    14,  and with\n\nqualifications courts use Clayton  Act precedents in applying\n\nsection  1972.  E.g., Swerdloff v. Miami Nat'l Bank, 584 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n54, 58-59 (5th Cir.  1978).  In empowering federal  courts to\n\nhear Clayton Act cases, Congress made  no reference to state-\n\ncourt  jurisdiction, see  15  U.S.C.    15,  and it  is  well\n                        \n\nsettled  (by judicial  construction)  that federal  antitrust\n\nclaims may be  asserted only in  federal court.   Blumenstock\n                                                             \n\nBros. Advertising  Agency v. Curtis  Pub. Co., 252  U.S. 436,\n                                            \n\n440  (1920).   The  borrowers urge  that  the same  gloss  be\n\napplied to the Bank Holding Company Act.\n\n     Exclusive  federal-court   jurisdiction  over  antitrust\n\nclaims, although  a firmly  rooted rule,  is  the product  of\n\nreasoning that the  Supreme Court  no longer  applies in  new\n\nmatters.    Like  baseball's judicial  \"exemption\"  from  the\n\nantitrust  laws, see  Flood  v. Kuhn,  407  U.S. 258,  283-84\n                                    \n\n(1972), the result persists but is not extended.  This is the\n\nclear  message of  Tafflin v.  Levitt, 493  U.S. 455,  459-60\n                                     \n\n(1990), where  the Supreme  Court affirmed the  state courts'\n\nconcurrent jurisdiction over  civil RICO claims  and rejected\n\n                             -6-\n\nthe  same Clayton Act analogy offered here.  Indeed, the RICO\n\nstatute uses  jurisdictional  language quite  similar to  the\n\nBank Holding Company Act, compare 18 U.S.C.   1964(c) with 12\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.   1975,  and was passed  by the same  Congress in  the\n\nsame  session.   Tafflin  offers the  coup  de grace  to  the\n                                                    \n\nborrowers' argument for exclusive jurisdiction.3\n\n     Once  that  issue is  removed,  the  application of  res\n                                                             \n\njudicata is straightforward in the present case.   The branch\n        \n\nof that doctrine  of concern  here, known for  many years  as\n\nmerger  (if the plaintiff had won the first case) and bar (if\n\nthe plaintiff had lost),  has lately been rechristened \"claim\n\npreclusion\"  in the  modern  functional style.    See Roy  v.\n                                                         \n\nJasper  Corp., 666  F.2d  714, 717  (1st  Cir. 1981).    More\n            \n\nimportant,  the doctrine  has  evolved  subtly, although  not\n\nuniformly in all jurisdictions,  to employ a functional \"same\n\ntransaction\" test,  as an overlay to  the traditional inquiry\n\nwhether the \"cause of  action\" in the two cases is  the same.\n\nMaine,  whose  earlier  judgment   is  invoked  here  as  res\n                                                             \n\njudicata, employs  this test,  which is therefore  binding on\n        \n\n                    \n\n     3We  give  little  weight to  occasional  references  by\nCongress,  in the  legislative  history of  section 1972,  to\nsuits  in \"federal\" courts.   See,  e.g., 2  One-Bank Holding\n                                                             \nCompany  Legislation of  1970:   Hearings  Before the  Senate\n                                                             \nComm. on  Banking and  Currency, 91st.  Cong.,  2d Sess.  966\n                               \n(1970) (statement of Sen. Bennett) (referring to \"the process\nof   suit  through  the  Federal  courts  .  .  .\").    These\nreferences, if any intent is attributable to them,  appear to\nreflect the natural assumption  that Bank Holding Company Act\nclaims would usually be litigated in federal forums.\n\n                             -7-\n\nus.  See Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd.  of Educ., 465\n                                                       \n\nU.S. 75, 85 (1984).\n\n     In Currier v. Cyr,  570 A.2d 1205 (Me. 1990),  the Maine\n                      \n\nSupreme  Judicial Court  summarized  the rule  it follows  in\n\ndeciding whether new  claims are barred because  they were or\n\n\"might have been\" litigated in the prior case: \n\n          Maine  has accepted  what is  known as  a\n          \"transactional test\" of cause  of action,\n          which defines \"the measure of  a cause of\n          action  as  the  aggregate  of  connected\n          operative  facts  that  can   be  handled\n          together  conveniently  for  purposes  of\n          trial.\"\n\nId. at 1208 (quoting  Gurski v. Culpovich, 540 A.2d  764, 766\n                                         \n\n(Me. 1988)).   Accordingly, so  long as the  parties are  the\n\nsame in  both cases and a  final judgment was  entered in the\n\nprior  action, \"a subsequent suit that arises out of the same\n                                                             \n\noperative  facts shall be barred even  though the second suit\n                \n\nrelies  upon a legal theory  not advanced in  the first case,\n\nseeks  different relief than  that sought in  the first case,\n\nand involves [different] evidence   . .  . .\"  Id.  (emphasis\n                                                 \n\nadded).\n\n     In the present case  the borrowers' federal claims under\n\nsection 1972 unquestionably arise  out of \"the same operative\n\nfacts\" as the state claims earlier asserted by the borrowers.\n\nThey themselves, in an unsuccessful  attempt to add the state\n\nclaims  to the  federal case  based on  pendant jurisdiction,\n\ntold  the district court that  \"[t]he facts forming the basis\n\n                             -8-\n\nfor the state claims are the same facts which  form the basis\n\nof the pending [federal] action . . . .\"  A comparison of the\n\ntwo   complaints   shows   that   the   factual   allegations\n\nsubstantially overlap.  Further, the central tying allegation\n\nin  the federal  complaint--that  the  banks  restricted  the\n\nborrowers' access  to alternative sources of  credit--was one\n\nof the express claims in the state action.\n\n     In this  court, the  borrowers make only  a half-hearted\n\neffort  to distinguish  the  two complaints  under the  Maine\n\ntransactions test for  res judicata, and  we think the  point\n                                   \n\nneeds  no  further   discussion.    The   borrowers'  central\n\narguments in  resisting res judicata,  exclusive jurisdiction\n                                    \n\naside,  are  variants  on a  single  theme.    They argue  in\n\nsubstance that  the banks themselves  strove to keep  the two\n\nactions separate,  resisted the assertion of  state claims in\n\nthe federal case  and vice versa, and now use the judgment in\n\nthe  suit first decided to prevent litigation of the other on\n\nthe  merits.   This effort  to resist consolidation,  say the\n\nborrowers, should estop the  banks from invoking res judicata\n                                                             \n\nor should be treated as a waiver of the defense.\n\n        We accept arguendo the  borrowers' version of events,\n                          \n\nalthough it is unclear whether the banks followed a conscious\n\nstrategy or merely opposed seriatim the successive demands of\n\nan  opponent.   But in  either event  we do  not see  how the\n\ngravamen    of   the   charge--the   banks'   resistance   to\n\n                             -9-\n\nconsolidation of the federal  and state claims--gives rise to\n\nan estoppel  of the banks.  The banks are not alleged to have\n\nsaid  anything untrue.  Their  position throughout  has  been\n\nconsistent.   There is not even a valid charge of concealment\n\nor surprise:  the banks' answer in the federal case gave fair\n\nwarning  of the  risk of  res judicata  by asserting  a claim\n                                      \n\nsplitting  defense, expressly  referring  to  the  borrowers'\n\nstate  suit \"arising out of the same transaction or series of\n\ntransactions.\"\n\n     As for waiver, it may be  assumed that Maine, consistent\n\nwith  general law on the subject, would disallow res judicata\n                                                             \n\nif the  \"parties have agreed  in terms or in  effect that the\n\nplaintiff  may   split  his  claim,  or   the  defendant  has\n\nacquiesced  therein.\"   Calderon Rosado  v. General  Electric\n                                                             \n\nCircuit  Breakers, Inc., 805 F.2d 1085,  1087 (1st Cir. 1986)\n                      \n\n(quoting  Restatement (Second)  of  Judgments     26(1)(a)).4\n                                             \n\nIndeed, in Thompson  v.

Kovac, 41 Ohio App. 310, 181 N.E.\n                                 \n\n                    \n\n     4In  Calderon  Rosado  this  court  rejected  on  waiver\n                          \ngrounds  a res  judicata defense  in a  federal action.   The\n                        \ndefendant  had earlier  agreed to  the  plaintiff's voluntary\ndismissal \"with  prejudice\"  of a  wrongful  discharge  claim\nunder  Puerto Rican law brought in  a local court, \"seemingly\nacceding to plaintiff's desire  to litigate in federal court\"\nunder a federal statute.  805 F.2d at 1086.\n\n                             -10-\n\n28, 30 (1931)).  In our case, the banks at the outset pleaded\n\nclaim-splitting in their answer and maintained  that position\n\nthroughout the case.\n\n     Courts  could, we suppose, disallow the claim preclusion\n\ndefense  wherever two  suits  are brought  and the  defendant\n\nthereafter resists their consolidation.  But when a plaintiff\n\nhas  chosen  to bring  two lawsuits  in  the same  time frame\n\nrelating  to the same operative facts, it  is hard to see why\n\nthe defendant should not  be able to resist consolidation  on\n\nproper  grounds, such as undue  delay.  If  the resistance is\n\nunjustified, the plaintiff  may normally litigate  that issue\n\nwithin the lawsuit.  In fact, the borrowers here  did seek to\n\nadd the federal claims to  the state action; but they  did so\n\nonly after summary judgment was  granted on the state claims.\n          \n\nNot surprisingly, the Maine  Supreme Judicial Court said that\n\nthis effort came too late.  Diversified Foods, Inc., 605 A.2d\n                                                  \n\nat 616.5\n\n     Finally, the borrowers suggest that, estoppel and waiver\n\nissues to one side, it would be inequitable to permit the res\n                                                             \n\njudicata  defense.  They argue that their decision to bring a\n        \n\nseparate federal  suit, instead of adding  the federal claims\n\n                    \n\n     5The borrowers  were  only  slightly  more  diligent  in\nseeking to add the state claims to the federal case.  In late\nJanuary 1991,  they moved to  amend the federal  complaint to\nassert the state claims and  to stay the state action.   This\noccurred, however, after the close of state discovery  and on\nthe  eve of the  banks' deadline for  filing summary judgment\nmotions.\n\n                             -11-\n\nto the  state case, was  based on  a good  faith belief  that\n\nexclusive federal-court jurisdiction  prevented that  course.\n\nRes   judicata   is   a   judge-made   doctrine   resting  on\n              \n\nconsiderations  of policy,  and doubtless  there is  room for\n\nequitable adjustments.   See generally 18  Charles A. Wright,\n                                      \n\nArthur R.  Miller &amp; Edward  H. Cooper,  Federal Practice  and\n                                                             \n\nProcedure     4415 (1981).   But  in  this case  the mistaken\n         \n\nbelief in  exclusive federal  jurisdiction was formed  in the\n\nface of two circuit decisions to the contrary.\n\n     Thus,  the  case for  an  equitable  departure from  res\n                                                             \n\njudicata  is very weak.  True, the banks played an aggressive\n        \n\nhand, but litigation is inherently  aggressive.  Further, the\n\nborrowers  created  their own  dilemma  by  bringing the  two\n\nactions  separately,   ignoring  the  concurrent-jurisdiction\n\nprecedents  directly in  point.   Then, in  the teeth  of the\n\nwarning furnished by the  banks' claim splitting defense, the\n\nborrowers  failed to assert  the federal claims  in the state\n\ncase  until after that  case had been  lost.  Like  the Maine\n\nSupreme  Judicial  Court,  we  see  no  equitable  basis  for\n\nresurrecting claims that the  borrowers themselves allowed to\n\nexpire.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -12-\n",

In this  case the district court\n                          \n\ndismissed  a suit brought under the Bank Holding Company Act,\n\n12 U.S.C.    1972, on  the ground that  it was barred  by res\n                                                             \n\njudicata.   The prior litigation, held to bar the new federal\n        \n\naction, was a state-court suit brought by the same plaintiffs\n\nagainst  the same  defendants  and decided  in  favor of  the\n\nlatter.   The disappointed  plaintiffs now appeal,  urging on\n\nseveral grounds  that res  judicata does not  properly apply.\n                                   \n\nIn full  agreement with  the district  court,  we affirm  its\n\ndecision.\n\n     The procedural history  of the two cases is  complex and\n\nintertwined but a  brief summary will suffice  at the outset.\n\nDiversified  Foods, Inc.,  and its  operating subsidiary  New\n\nEngland Sales,  Inc.  (collectively, \"the  borrowers\"),  were\n\nengaged in  a specialized  form of wholesale  distribution of\n\ngoods.   In  financing  their activities,  they entered  into\n\nvarious borrowing  arrangements with First  National Bank  of\n\nBoston   and  its   Maine  subsidiary  Casco   Northern  Bank\n\n(collectively, \"the  banks\").  The arrangements,  at least in\n\nthe  borrowers'  view,  contained  terms   restricting  their\n\nability to obtain alternative sources of financing.\n\n     During 1988, the borrowers  first sought to expand their\n\nbusiness and then suffered large losses.  They attribute this\n\nreversal  of fortune to the  failure of the  banks to provide\n\nadequate credit under  the borrowing arrangements.   Claiming\n\n                             -2-\n\nmultimillion  dollar  damages, the  borrowers  on  August 21,\n\n1989, brought suit against the banks in Maine Superior Court,\n\nasserting various  state-law tort  and contract claims.   The\n\ncomplaint, as later amended in 1990, included the charge that\n\nthe  banks violated  an  implied covenant  of  good faith  by\n\nimposing  \"unreasonable restrictions  so  as  to prevent  the\n\n[borrowers] from obtaining alternative financing.\"  Discovery\n\nin the state case proceeded during 1989 and 1990.\n\n     On  September  14,  1990,   while  the  state  case  was\n\nproceeding, the borrowers brought the present action  against\n\nthe  banks based  on the  anti-tying  provisions of  the Bank\n\nHolding  Company Act, 12 U.S.C.    1972(1).   The new federal\n\nclaims  were  based,  it  appears,  on  information  obtained\n\nthrough  discovery in the state case.  The borrowers say that\n\nthe  new claims  were  asserted in  a  separate action  in  a\n\ndifferent  court because at that  time the borrowers held the\n\nview (contrary to two  circuit decisions) that federal courts\n\nhave exclusive jurisdiction over claims under section 1972.1\n\n                    \n\n     1Two  weeks before  filing  the  federal complaint,  the\nborrowers moved to amend their state complaint to charge that\nthe  banks  had  breached  their   duty  of  good  faith   by\n\"unreasonable, illegal, and anticompetitive\"  restrictions on\nalternative financing.   Shortly after the federal  complaint\nwas filed, the banks  opposed the state amendment.   When the\nborrowers responded  that the  federal claims were  not being\nasserted  in the  state  case, the  state  court allowed  the\namendment,     striking     the    words     \"illegal\"    and\n\"anticompetitive.\"\n\n                             -3-\n\n     When the banks answered the federal complaint on October\n\n24, 1990, they included  as a defense the assertion  that the\n\nborrowers  \"have improperly  split  their causes  of  action,\n\nhaving  previously filed  in another court  another complaint\n\narising   out  of   the   same  transaction   or  series   of\n\ntransactions.\"  Thereafter, the banks resisted the borrowers'\n\nefforts in January  1991 to introduce  the state claims  into\n\nthe federal action by amendment  of the federal complaint  or\n\nto delay the state proceedings.  The banks  did agree to have\n\ndiscovery in either case treated as if taken in both.\n\n     On  April 18,  1991,  the Maine  Superior Court  granted\n\nsummary  judgment in  favor of  the banks,  a decision  later\n\naffirmed on  appeal.

The  banks then  moved for\n    \n\nsummary  judgment in  the  federal action  on grounds  of res\n                                                             \n\njudicata,  and  the  district  court granted  the  motion  on\n        \n\nJanuary  9,  1992.   A belated  attempt  by the  borrowers to\n\nreopen  the state case to add the federal claims was rejected\n\nby  the state  court, and  this action  was also  affirmed on\n\nappeal.  Id.  The  borrowers then pursued this appeal in  the\n           \n\nfederal case.\n\n     In  this court  the borrowers  first argue  that federal\n\ncourts have exclusive jurisdiction over claims under the Bank\n\nHolding Company Act's anti-tying provisions.  Therefore, they\n\nargue,  res judicata  cannot properly  derive from  the state\n                    \n\n                             -4-\n\ncourt  judgment  because they  could  not  have included  the\n\nfederal  claims  in their  state case.    We need  not decide\n\nwhether  the  conclusion would  follow  if  the premise  were\n\nsound, for the premise  is mistaken.  We follow  two circuits\n\nand  several  other courts  that  uniformly  hold that  state\n\ntribunals  have  concurrent  jurisdiction over  section  1972\n\nclaims.  Cuervo  Resources, Inc. v.

The branch\n        \n\nof that doctrine  of concern  here, known for  many years  as\n\nmerger  (if the plaintiff had won the first case) and bar (if\n\nthe plaintiff had lost),  has lately been rechristened \"claim\n\npreclusion\"  in the  modern  functional style.

More\n            \n\nimportant,  the doctrine  has  evolved  subtly, although  not\n\nuniformly in all jurisdictions,  to employ a functional \"same\n\ntransaction\" test,  as an overlay to  the traditional inquiry\n\nwhether the \"cause of  action\" in the two cases is  the same.\n\nMaine,  whose  earlier  judgment   is  invoked  here  as  res\n                                                             \n\njudicata, employs  this test,  which is therefore  binding on\n        \n\n                    \n\n     3We  give  little  weight to  occasional  references  by\nCongress,  in the  legislative  history of  section 1972,  to\nsuits  in \"federal\" courts.

Further, the central tying allegation\n\nin  the federal  complaint--that  the  banks  restricted  the\n\nborrowers' access  to alternative sources of  credit--was one\n\nof the express claims in the state action.\n\n     In this  court, the  borrowers make only  a half-hearted\n\neffort  to distinguish  the  two complaints  under the  Maine\n\ntransactions test for  res judicata, and  we think the  point\n                                   \n\nneeds  no  further   discussion.    The   borrowers'  central\n\narguments in  resisting res judicata,  exclusive jurisdiction\n                                    \n\naside,  are  variants  on a  single  theme.    They argue  in\n\nsubstance that  the banks themselves  strove to keep  the two\n\nactions separate,  resisted the assertion of  state claims in\n\nthe federal case  and vice versa, and now use the judgment in\n\nthe  suit first decided to prevent litigation of the other on\n\nthe  merits.   This effort  to resist consolidation,  say the\n\nborrowers, should estop the  banks from invoking res judicata\n                                                             \n\nor should be treated as a waiver of the defense.\n\n        We accept arguendo the  borrowers' version of events,\n                          \n\nalthough it is unclear whether the banks followed a conscious\n\nstrategy or merely opposed seriatim the successive demands of\n\nan  opponent.   But in  either event  we do  not see  how the\n\ngravamen    of   the   charge--the   banks'   resistance   to\n\n                             -9-\n\nconsolidation of the federal  and state claims--gives rise to\n\nan estoppel  of the banks.  The banks are not alleged to have\n\nsaid  anything untrue.  Their  position throughout  has  been\n\nconsistent.   There is not even a valid charge of concealment\n\nor surprise:  the banks' answer in the federal case gave fair\n\nwarning  of the  risk of  res judicata  by asserting  a claim\n                                      \n\nsplitting  defense, expressly  referring  to  the  borrowers'\n\nstate  suit \"arising out of the same transaction or series of\n\ntransactions.\"\n\n     As for waiver, it may be  assumed that Maine, consistent\n\nwith  general law on the subject, would disallow res judicata\n                                                             \n\nif the  \"parties have agreed  in terms or in  effect that the\n\nplaintiff  may   split  his  claim,  or   the  defendant  has\n\nacquiesced  therein.\"   Calderon Rosado  v.

The\n                        \ndefendant  had earlier  agreed to  the  plaintiff's voluntary\ndismissal \"with  prejudice\"  of a  wrongful  discharge  claim\nunder  Puerto Rican law brought in  a local court, \"seemingly\nacceding to plaintiff's desire  to litigate in federal court\"\nunder a federal statute.  805 F.2d at 1086.\n\n                             -10-\n\n28, 30 (1931)).  In our case, the banks at the outset pleaded\n\nclaim-splitting in their answer and maintained  that position\n\nthroughout the case.\n\n     Courts  could, we suppose, disallow the claim preclusion\n\ndefense  wherever two  suits  are brought  and the  defendant\n\nthereafter resists their consolidation.  But when a plaintiff\n\nhas  chosen  to bring  two lawsuits  in  the same  time frame\n\nrelating  to the same operative facts, it  is hard to see why\n\nthe defendant should not  be able to resist consolidation  on\n\nproper  grounds, such as undue  delay.  If  the resistance is\n\nunjustified, the plaintiff  may normally litigate  that issue\n\nwithin the lawsuit.  In fact, the borrowers here  did seek to\n\nadd the federal claims to  the state action; but they  did so\n\nonly after summary judgment was  granted on the state claims.\n          \n\nNot surprisingly, the Maine  Supreme Judicial Court said that\n\nthis effort came too late.  Diversified Foods, Inc., 605 A.2d\n                                                  \n\nat 616.5\n\n     Finally, the borrowers suggest that, estoppel and waiver\n\nissues to one side, it would be inequitable to permit the res\n                                                             \n\njudicata  defense.  They argue that their decision to bring a\n        \n\nseparate federal  suit, instead of adding  the federal claims\n\n                    \n\n     5The borrowers  were  only  slightly  more  diligent  in\nseeking to add the state claims to the federal case.  In late\nJanuary 1991,  they moved to  amend the federal  complaint to\nassert the state claims and  to stay the state action.   This\noccurred, however, after the close of state discovery  and on\nthe  eve of the  banks' deadline for  filing summary judgment\nmotions.\n\n                             -11-\n\nto the  state case, was  based on  a good  faith belief  that\n\nexclusive federal-court jurisdiction  prevented that  course.\n\nRes   judicata   is   a   judge-made   doctrine   resting  on\n              \n\nconsiderations  of policy,  and doubtless  there is  room for\n\nequitable adjustments.   See generally 18  Charles A. Wright,\n                                      \n\nArthur R.  Miller &amp; Edward  H.

But  in  this case  the mistaken\n         \n\nbelief in  exclusive federal  jurisdiction was formed  in the\n\nface of two circuit decisions to the contrary.\n\n     Thus,  the  case for  an  equitable  departure from  res\n                                                             \n\njudicata  is very weak.  True, the banks played an aggressive\n        \n\nhand, but litigation is inherently  aggressive.  Further, the\n\nborrowers  created  their own  dilemma  by  bringing the  two\n\nactions  separately,   ignoring  the  concurrent-jurisdiction\n\nprecedents  directly in  point.   Then, in  the teeth  of the\n\nwarning furnished by the  banks' claim splitting defense, the\n\nborrowers  failed to assert  the federal claims  in the state\n\ncase  until after that  case had been  lost.  Like  the Maine\n\nSupreme  Judicial  Court,  we  see  no  equitable  basis  for\n\nresurrecting claims that the  borrowers themselves allowed to\n\nexpire.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -12-\n</pre>",
