Ralph Maling appeals from a\n                             \n\njudgment  imposing a  fine  as partial  punishment for  drug\n\ncrimes.  He argues, in essence, that the court wanted to set\n\nthe fine at a level that would credit him with  the value of\n\nproperty to be forfeited.  He adds that the court failed  to\n\ndo so.   And, the  Government, he says,  is responsible  for\n\nthis failure.   We find the  district court's determinations\n\nlawful, and we affirm its judgment.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          The reader  should keep in mind  the following two\n\nsets of background events:\n\n          Forfeitures.     In  May   1990,  Maling  and  the\n                     \n\nGovernment entered  into a  Plea Agreement, in  which Maling\n\n(and  several co-defendants) agreed to forfeit property that\n\nwould  have a  total value  of $2.8  million.   In September\n\n1990,  Maling  signed  a  separate  agreement  in  which  he\n\npromised  to  forfeit  assets  (listed  in  the  agreement's\n\nAppendix  A)  including some  condominiums  owned by  J  &amp; R\n\nProperties, Inc.,  a firm  of which he  and James  Taglienti\n\neach  owned half.  On September 20, 1990, the district court\n\nentered  an  initial \"Amended  Order  of Forfeiture,\"  which\n\nlisted the  condominiums (among  other properties) as  items\n\nsubject to  forfeiture (the forfeiture itself  to take place\n          \n\nonly  after the  court had  an  opportunity to  consider any\n\ncompeting  claims to the property).  See 21 U.S.C.   853(a),\n                                        \n\n(p) (providing for assets to be made subject to forfeiture);\n\n  853(n)(7) (providing  a mechanism for forfeiture  actually\n\nto  occur); United States v. Schwimmer,  968 F.2d 1570, 1576\n                                      \n\nn.4 (2d Cir.  1992) (interpreting the  RICO equivalent of   \n\n853(n)(7) as implying that the Government does not take good\n\ntitle to forfeited property until after competing claims are\n\ndetermined); Amended Order of Forfeiture,    8.  On November\n\n13,  1990, Taglienti  filed a  petition objecting,  under 21\n\nU.S.C.   853(n), to the forfeiture of the J &amp; R condominiums\n\non the ground that he (through J &amp; R) owned  a half interest\n\nin  them.    The  Government  then  refused  to  accept  the\n\ncondominiums  as satisfying  (in  part) Maling's  forfeiture\n\nobligation.   And,  on  May 26,  1992,  the  district  court\n\nentered a \"Final Order of Forfeiture,\" which forfeited other\n\nproperty, but which specifically  said that the condominiums\n\nwere not forfeited.\n        \n\n          The Fine.   In September 1990,  the district court\n                  \n\nimposed a  fine of $250,000 as  partial punishment following\n\nMaling's guilty plea to drug charges.  Maling appealed.  See\n                                                            \n\nUnited  States  v. Maling,  942  F.2d  808 (1st  Cir.  1991)\n                         \n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n(\"Maling I\").  He argued that the Plea Agreement had assumed\n          \n\nthat the  defendants  would  pay  no  more  (in  fines  plus\n\nforfeitures) than  $2.8 million  total.   He added  that the\n\nfine plus  forfeitures would exceed that amount.   We agreed\n\nthat the Plea Agreement did assume a $2.8 million \"ceiling,\"\n\nbut we held that  the Plea Agreement bound the  parties, not\n\nthe district  court.   Nonetheless, we concluded  that there\n\nhad  been \"confusion during the sentencing proceedings about\n\nthe  meaning of the Plea  Agreement.\"  And,  because of that\n\nconfusion,  we  would \"vacate  the  sentence  insofar as  it\n\nimposes fines . .  . and remand for resentencing  in respect\n\nto fines.\"  Id. at 811.  We said specifically:\n               \n\n          Although the Agreement does not bind the\n                                                  \n          district    court,   we    believe   the\n                           \n          appellants should now be  sentenced with\n          the  district court  fully aware  of the\n          Agreement's  efforts  to  impose a  $2.8\n          million cap upon  the appellants'  total\n          financial liability.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n   \n\n          On  remand, the  district  court received  written\n\nsubmissions  from  the   parties  and  held  three   further\n\nhearings.  The  court said  that it wished  to impose  fines\n\nsuch that  the \"total  financial liability\" would  amount to\n\n$2.8 million.   The court then  entered judgment imposing  a\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nfine  of  $634,000  against Maling.    He  now appeals  that\n\njudgment.\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n                             II\n\n                    The Size of the Gap\n                                       \n\n          The  district  court  made clear  that  its  basic\n\nobjective  in assessing a fine in the amount of $634,000 was\n\nto  fill a gap  -- the gap  between the value  of the assets\n\nforfeited and  the  $2.8 million  Plea Agreement  \"ceiling.\"\n\nMaling  says the  district court  was mistaken  in believing\n\nthere was such a gap.   In particular, he says, the  gap was\n\nfilled,  without   the  fine,   by  1)  his   forfeiture  of\n\ncondominiums  owned  by J  &amp; R  Properties, Inc.,  valued at\n\n$300,000,  and 2)  his forfeiture  of property  in Westwood,\n\nvalued at  $335,000.  The  Government refuses to  accept the\n\ncondominiums;  it agrees that  Maling forfeited the Westwood\n\nproperty after entry  of the $634,000 judgment  and that the\n\njudgment must  be modified to  take its value  into account.\n\n(The  district court  expressly left  the judgment  open for\n\nsixty  days so that it  could be modified.)   The Government\n\ndisagrees, however, about the value of that property.  \n\n          The upshot is that the  Government believes Maling\n\nmust pay a fine  of $344,000, while Maling believes  he need\n\nnot  pay any  fine  at all.    The difference  reflects  the\n\ndisagreements about whether the Government must accept the J\n\n&amp; R condominiums (worth $300,000) and about the value of the\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nWestwood property (the difference in valuations amounting to\n\n$45,000).\n\n          Before turning to the  disagreements, we point out\n\nthat the district court has broad legal powers to  determine\n\nthe amount of  the fine.  See Fed.  R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B);\n                             \n\nMaling I, 942  F.2d at  810 (court not  bound by  sentencing\n        \n\nrecommendations derived from Plea Agreement) (citing cases);\n\n21 U.S.C.   848(a)  (authorizing a fine of up  to $2 million\n\nfor one  of the  offenses of  which  Maling was  convicted);\n\nU.S.S.G.     5E1.2(c)(4)   (Sentencing  Guidelines  do   not\n\nconstrain fines where statute  authorizes fines in excess of\n\n$250,000); United States v. Savoie, No. 92-1920, slip op. at\n                                  \n\n14-15  (1st Cir.  Feb. 8, 1993)  (appellate review  of fines\n\nimposed  by  the  district  court  is  under  \"an  abuse-of-\n\ndiscretion  rubric\"  only).    The  court  was  not  legally\n\ncompelled to limit  its fine to the size  of the gap (though\n\nit quite reasonably chose  to do so).  Similarly,  the court\n\nwas  not legally required to measure the gap precisely or to\n\nengage  in  professional   matters  of  appraisal  or   make\n\ntechnical  property law determinations in doing so.  The law\n\nwould permit the court to assess  its fine on the basis of a\n\nrough estimate of the gap size, or on an assumption that the\n\nGovernment would  probably, but not definitely, win disputed\n                                              \n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nmatters in respect to what was, or what was not, forfeitable\n\nunder  the Plea Agreement.   For this reason,  we review the\n\ndistrict court's judgments about \"gap size\" with a degree of\n\ndeference.\n\n          a. The  J &amp; R  Condominiums.  Maling  must concede\n                                      \n\nthat  there is  a $300,000  gap, for,  in fact,  he  has not\n\nforfeited  the J &amp; R  condominiums.  Rather,  he argues that\n\nthe Government  should have  accepted  the condominiums  for\n                           \n\nforfeiture, and the district  court should have assessed the\n\nfine  as if the government had done  so.  His claim that the\n           \n\nGovernment  had to  accept the  condominiums stems  from the\n\nPlea Agreement, which says that  the parties will enter into\n\na \"separate agreement\"  that \"specifically describe[s]\"  the\n\n\"property  and  assets\" to  be  forfeited.   That  \"separate\n\nagreement\"  (as we have said)  lists the J  &amp; R condominiums\n\namong  those  assets.     Consequently,  says  Maling,   the\n\nGovernment, having signed this \"separate  agreement,\" cannot\n\nlater reject the assets that it listed.\n\n          The Plea Agreement, however, contains an important\n\nqualification.  It says  that \"physical assets\" will satisfy\n\nthe \"forfeiture\"  obligation only if  those physical  assets\n\nare  \"without any encumbrances.\"  This qualification affects\n\nthe \"separate agreement\" subsequently  made pursuant to  the\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nPlea Agreement.   Thus,  we read the  Government's September\n\n1990 agreement,  accepting the forfeiture of  \"[a]ny and all\n                                                            \n\ninterest  of J &amp; R  Properties, Inc.\" (our  emphasis) in the\n\ncondominiums  (not  merely  the  \"interest\"  of  Maling)  as\n\nconditioned on  the  condominiums' being  unencumbered  when\n\nforfeited.  As we  have said, after the parties  signed that\n\n\"separate agreement\" and  after Maling (as J &amp; R's President\n\nand Treasurer) purported to convey the J &amp; R condominiums to\n\nthe Government (but before  the forfeiture order was final),\n\nMaling's J &amp;  R co-owner  James Taglienti  filed a  petition\n\nwith the court, under  21 U.S.C.   853(n), objecting  to the\n\nforfeiture  on  the  ground  that he  had  a  fifty  percent\n\ninterest  in the  condominiums.   The  Government asked  the\n\ncourt  to omit  the condominiums  from its  final forfeiture\n\norder because it considered the petition an \"encumbrance.\"\n\n          Maling  argues that  neither the  petition  (nor a\n\nlater-filed  state tax  lien,  which we  need not  consider)\n\namounts  to   an  \"encumbrance.\"     First,  he   says  that\n\nTaglienti's petition is without legal  merit, for Taglienti,\n\ntoo,  was   involved  in  (or  knew   about)  relevant  drug\n\nactivities, which involvement would prevent him from  saving\n\nhis interests  in the condominiums from forfeiture.   See 21\n                                                         \n\nU.S.C.    853(c), (n)(6).  He adds that, even if Taglienti's\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\npetition is otherwise  valid, the Government  received title\n\ndocuments from J  &amp; R's President and Treasurer  (Maling) in\n\n\"good faith,\" which fact, under Massachusetts law, means the\n\nGovernment   takes  title   free  of   Taglienti's  asserted\n\ninterests.  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 155,   8; ch. 156B,   115; cf.\n                                                            \n\nUnited States v. New Silver Palace Restaurant, Inc., 1992 WL\n                                                   \n\n404160  (E.D.N.Y.  Nov.  25,  1992)  (finding  shareholders'\n\nrights  in respect to  corporate assets to  be an inadequate\n\nbasis for  a petition against  forfeiture under 21  U.S.C.  \n\n881).\n\n          We  need not  consider  whether or  not Maling  is\n\ncorrect about the merits  of Taglienti's claim, however, nor\n\nneed the district  court have done  so.  We read  the phrase\n\n\"without any  encumbrances\" as  one who buys  property would\n\nlikely  read it,  namely  as imposing  upon the  conveyer an\n\nobligation  to clear up any  asserted legal claims upon that\n\nproperty prior to transfer, so  that the buyer will  receive\n\nthe property alone, instead  of receiving \"the property plus\n\nthe obligation  to fight  a lawsuit\" (regardless  of whether\n\nthe  lawsuit ultimately  turns out  to  be unfounded).   See\n                                                            \n\nAmerican Law of Property   18.84 (A. James Casner ed., 1952)\n                        \n\n(\"A pending  action assailing a vendor's  title or asserting\n\nan interest therein or  a lien thereon of which  a purchaser\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\nhas notice is at least a cloud  on the title.  Since a court\n\nwill not compel a purchaser to 'buy a lawsuit,' the pendency\n\nof  one  of the  character  indicated  is an  encumbrance.\")\n\n(citations omitted).   Such  a reading would  avoid imposing\n\nupon the Government title-clearing obligations  that it does\n\nnot wish  to  undertake, without  (ordinarily)  harming  the\n\npotential  transferor  (who  simply  would  retain  whatever\n\nproperty interest  he previously  owned).  Maling  points to\n\nnothing that  might suggest that this natural reading of the\n\nagreement is incorrect.  \n\n          Such a  reading ends the argument.   To adjudicate\n\nthe  merits  of  Taglienti's  claim would  require  a  legal\n\nproceeding (perhaps a rather  complicated one), as would any\n\neffort to  demonstrate that  the Government (which  had long\n\nknown  that Taglienti  was Maling's  J &amp;  R co-owner)  was a\n\n\"good  faith\" transferee entitled to  clear title in all the\n\nproperty, irrespective  of the merits of  Taglienti's claim.\n                      \n\nSee Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 155,   8; ch.  156B,   115 (requiring\n   \n\n\"good faith\" for transferee  of real estate from corporation\n\nto take free of rights of owners of corporation).  Hence, we\n\nsee nothing unlawful about the district court construing the\n\nPlea  Agreement's word  \"encumbrance\"  as  encompassing  the\n\nTaglienti petition.\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\n          Maling   also  claims   that  the   Government  is\n\n\"estopped\"   from  refusing  to   accept  the  condominiums.\n\nEstoppel, however, requires a statement or promise or action\n\nthat leads to reasonable reliance to one's detriment.   See,\n                                                           \n\ne.g., Restatement  (Second) of Contracts    90(1) (1981) (\"A\n                                        \n\npromise  which  the  promisor  should  reasonably expect  to\n\ninduce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee . .\n\n.  and  which  does  induce such  action  or  forbearance is\n                                                         \n\nbinding if injustice can  be avoided only by enforcement  of\n\nthe promise.\") (emphasis added).  We cannot find a statement\n\nor action by the Government, in respect to the condominiums,\n\nthat led Maling reasonably  to rely to his detriment  on the\n\nGovernment's keeping the  condominiums despite a  pre-final-\n\norder   \"encumbrance\"  which,  under   the  plea  agreement,\n\nentitled it  to reject them.   The  Government, we  concede,\n\nknew (as, of course, did Maling) that Taglienti was a  J &amp; R\n    \n\nco-owner  long  before  the  condominiums  appeared  on  the\n\n\"separate agreement\" forfeiture list.  But, Maling points to\n\nno statement  or action  that suggests that  the Government,\n\nrather than Maling, was  responsible for preventing any such\n                                    \n\nlegal  \"cloud\"  upon  the  property  from  arising,  or  for\n\nremoving  it  once  it arose.    We  also  concede that  the\n\nGovernment,  for   a   time,  accepted   condominium   rents\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\n(presumably  because  it anticipated  that  forfeiture would\n\ntransfer  the property  to the  Government  with retroactive\n\neffect, 21 U.S.C.   853(c)).   But, we do not see how Maling\n\nis  any the  worse  for its  having  done so  (assuming,  of\n\ncourse,  that the Government pays  over to him  the rents it\n\nreceived).    That  is  to  say,  we  do  not  see  how  the\n\nGovernment's   returning   the    property   makes    Maling\n                        \n\nsignificantly  worse  off  than  had  the  Government  never\n\nincluded the  property on  the \"separate agreement\"  list in\n        \n\nthe first place.   The district court could  reasonably have\n\nfound  no \"reliance to  his detriment\" on  Maling's part and\n\ntherefore no \"estoppel.\"\n\n          Maling's  strongest argument is  that he wanted to\n                                                         \n\nclear Taglienti's \"encumbrance;\" indeed, he asked the  court\n\nto permit him  to prove that Taglienti  was not the kind  of\n\n\"good  faith\"   or  innocent  owner  who   could  object  to\n\nforfeiture of  his own  (i.e., Taglienti's) interest  in the\n\nproperty.    See  21 U.S.C.     853(n)(6).    But, once  the\n                \n\nGovernment  told  the  court  that  it   did  not  want  the\n\ncondominiums,  the court simply  denied Maling's  request as\n\n\"moot.\"  Maling,  in essence, asks, \"How  can the Government\n\nturn  down the  property  as encumbered  without letting  me\n\nremove the encumbrance?\"  \n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\n          The short, conclusive answer to this question lies\n\nin  the Plea Agreement itself.   It says  the Government can\n\nturn  down  encumbered  property.    It  does  not  say  the\n\nGovernment  must   give  Maling   a  chance  to   remove  an\n\nencumbrance.  And, we  will not read  such a right into  the\n\nAgreement, at least, in  respect to this kind of  removal of\n                                             \n\nan  encumbrance.    Maling  does  not  offer  to  show  that\n\nTaglienti  does not own the  property.  Rather,  he wants to\n                       \n\nintervene  in the  special  statutory  \"third  party  versus\n\nGovernment\" proceedings  to show  that the  Government could\n                                                            \n\ndefeat  Taglienti's interest, if it decided to try to do so.\n\n21  U.S.C.   853(c), (n)(6).  But, the statute creates those\n\nspecial  proceedings,  placing  a  special  burden on  third\n\nparties to prove that  they have \"clean hands,\" in  order to\n\nbenefit the Government.  See S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d\n                            \n\nSess. 82, 191-92, 208,  reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182,\n                                    \n\n3265,   3374-75,  3391  (expressing   purposes  of  removing\n\nobstacles  in the  way of  federal law  enforcement agencies\n\nseeking   forfeiture,   of  ensuring   expedition,   and  of\n\nprotecting third parties); United  States v.

They are not  designed to help defendants\n\nwho  would   like  to  see  some   other  person's  property\n                                        \n\nforfeited, thereby perhaps obtaining credit.  Thus, we think\n\nthe court  acted lawfully  in denying Maling's  petition for\n\nsuch a proceeding.\n\n          Is this result unfair to Maling?  One  can imagine\n\ncircumstances  that could  make it  seem so.    Suppose, for\n\nexample,   that  the  Government,  knowing  full  well  that\n\nTaglienti would  likely create an encumbrance  (i.e., file a\n\npetition objecting  to the  forfeiture) led Maling  down the\n\ngarden  path.   On the  other hand,  one can  easily imagine\n\ncircumstances  that  indicate the  contrary.    Suppose, for\n\nexample,  that the Government  assumed that  Taglienti would\n\nnot  object  (or  that  Maling could  persuade  him  not  to\n\nobject); or, suppose that the Government did not think about\n\nthe  matter and Maling simply  saw a fleeting opportunity to\n\nsatisfy a portion of his debt with  someone else's property.\n\nRegardless, this kind of  ultimate fairness or unfairness to\n\nMaling would arise out  of facts and circumstances  of which\n\nwe  know  little.    And,  it is  beside  the  point.    The\n\nGovernment and  Maling signed  an Agreement the  language of\n\nwhich placed the  risk of this,  and any other,  encumbrance\n\nupon Maling.   In all likelihood the  Government wanted this\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nlanguage so that it would not have to become involved in the\n\nkind of  property law disagreements that  Maling now raises.\n\nThe district court  so interpreted the Agreement.   It based\n\nits  fine  upon  that  interpretation.    In  our  view, the\n\ndistrict court's view is  reasonable; and the resulting fine\n\nis therefore lawful.\n\n          b. The Westwood Property.  Maling argues about the\n                                   \n\nvalue of his forfeited Westwood property, property which was\n\nnot included in the September 1990 \"separate agreement\" list\n\nand which he offered to forfeit for the first  time in about\n\nSeptember 1991.   An  appraisal made about  seventeen months\n\nearlier (before  the plea agreement) valued  the property at\n\n$335,000.  By late 1991, when Maling offered the property to\n\nthe Government,  its value  had declined  to $245,000.   The\n\nGovernment told  the court  that, for purposes  of assessing\n\nthe  \"gap-filling\" fine,  it would  assume the  property was\n\nworth  $290,000, thereby \"splitting  the difference\" between\n\nthe two evaluations.\n\n          Maling argues that he  should be credited with the\n\nhigher  valuation.   But,  we can  find  no promise  by  the\n\nGovernment that it would do so.  And, in the absence of such\n\na  promise, we  are aware of  no law that  would prevent the\n\nGovernment from advising the  court that the property should\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nbe assessed at $290,000 for \"gap-filling\"  purposes.  In the\n\nabsence of  some specific  agreement about valuation  dates,\n\n\"splitting the difference\" does not seem unreasonable to us;\n\nand we do  not know why  the district  court could not  have\n\nreached a similar conclusion.\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\n                            III\n\n                    Recommending a Fine\n                                       \n\n          The Plea  Agreement, while leaving the  court free\n\nto impose a fine,  nonetheless prohibits the Government from\n\nrecommending  a fine.   See  Maling I,  942 F.2d  at 810-11.\n                                     \n\nMaling says  that  the Government  violated this  obligation\n\nwhen counsel told the district court, for example: \n\n          If the Court is entertaining the thought\n          of a fine,  my suggestion  in [sic]  how\n          that should  be fashioned . .  . is that\n          the Court  should  issue an  order of  a\n          criminal fine in the amount of $634,000.\n\nTaken  out of context, this statement, and a few others like\n\nit, might suggest a not-very-subtle attempt to avoid the \"no\n\nrecommendation\"  obligation.  Cf.  United States  v. Canada,\n                                                           \n\n960 F.2d  263, 269  (1st Cir. 1992)  (we will not  allow the\n\nGovernment to pay \"lip service\" to a plea agreement and then\n\ndo  \"end-runs\" around it).   But, in context, the statements\n\nare perfectly proper.\n\n          The context  reveals that  the district  court had\n\nalready  decided to impose a  fine despite the  absence of a\n\nfine recommendation.  The context makes clear that the court\n\nwanted, or could  benefit from, discussion, recommendations,\n\nand argument from all counsel, about the amount of fine that\n                     \n\nwould  keep the  total  monetary liability  within the  $2.8\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\nmillion \"ceiling.\"  Government counsel, stating specifically\n\nthat  the \"U.S. Government is not recommending to this Court\n\nthat they [sic]  impose a fine,\" went  on to respond  to the\n\ncourt's request to  help it determine  the proper amount  of\n\nthe fine that the court independently had decided to impose.\n\nWe see no violation of the Plea Agreement.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n",

He argues, in essence, that the court wanted to set\n\nthe fine at a level that would credit him with  the value of\n\nproperty to be forfeited.  He adds that the court failed  to\n\ndo so.   And, the  Government, he says,  is responsible  for\n\nthis failure.   We find the  district court's determinations\n\nlawful, and we affirm its judgment.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          The reader  should keep in mind  the following two\n\nsets of background events:\n\n          Forfeitures.     In  May   1990,  Maling  and  the\n                     \n\nGovernment entered  into a  Plea Agreement, in  which Maling\n\n(and  several co-defendants) agreed to forfeit property that\n\nwould  have a  total value  of $2.8  million.   In September\n\n1990,  Maling  signed  a  separate  agreement  in  which  he\n\npromised  to  forfeit  assets  (listed  in  the  agreement's\n\nAppendix  A)  including some  condominiums  owned by  J  &amp; R\n\nProperties, Inc.,  a firm  of which he  and James  Taglienti\n\neach  owned half.  On September 20, 1990, the district court\n\nentered  an  initial \"Amended  Order  of Forfeiture,\"  which\n\nlisted the  condominiums (among  other properties) as  items\n\nsubject to  forfeiture (the forfeiture itself  to take place\n          \n\nonly  after the  court had  an  opportunity to  consider any\n\ncompeting  claims to the property).  See 21 U.S.C.   853(a),\n                                        \n\n(p) (providing for assets to be made subject to forfeiture);\n\n  853(n)(7) (providing  a mechanism for forfeiture  actually\n\nto  occur); United States v.

On November\n\n13,  1990, Taglienti  filed a  petition objecting,  under 21\n\nU.S.C.   853(n), to the forfeiture of the J &amp; R condominiums\n\non the ground that he (through J &amp; R) owned  a half interest\n\nin  them.    The  Government  then  refused  to  accept  the\n\ncondominiums  as satisfying  (in  part) Maling's  forfeiture\n\nobligation.   And,  on  May 26,  1992,  the  district  court\n\nentered a \"Final Order of Forfeiture,\" which forfeited other\n\nproperty, but which specifically  said that the condominiums\n\nwere not forfeited.\n        \n\n          The Fine.   In September 1990,  the district court\n                  \n\nimposed a  fine of $250,000 as  partial punishment following\n\nMaling's guilty plea to drug charges.  Maling appealed.

He argued that the Plea Agreement had assumed\n          \n\nthat the  defendants  would  pay  no  more  (in  fines  plus\n\nforfeitures) than  $2.8 million  total.   He added  that the\n\nfine plus  forfeitures would exceed that amount.   We agreed\n\nthat the Plea Agreement did assume a $2.8 million \"ceiling,\"\n\nbut we held that  the Plea Agreement bound the  parties, not\n\nthe district  court.   Nonetheless, we concluded  that there\n\nhad  been \"confusion during the sentencing proceedings about\n\nthe  meaning of the Plea  Agreement.\"  And,  because of that\n\nconfusion,  we  would \"vacate  the  sentence  insofar as  it\n\nimposes fines . .  . and remand for resentencing  in respect\n\nto fines.\"  Id. at 811.  We said specifically:\n               \n\n          Although the Agreement does not bind the\n                                                  \n          district    court,   we    believe   the\n                           \n          appellants should now be  sentenced with\n          the  district court  fully aware  of the\n          Agreement's  efforts  to  impose a  $2.8\n          million cap upon  the appellants'  total\n          financial liability.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n   \n\n          On  remand, the  district  court received  written\n\nsubmissions  from  the   parties  and  held  three   further\n\nhearings.  The  court said  that it wished  to impose  fines\n\nsuch that  the \"total  financial liability\" would  amount to\n\n$2.8 million.   The court then  entered judgment imposing  a\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\nfine  of  $634,000  against Maling.    He  now appeals  that\n\njudgment.\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n                             II\n\n                    The Size of the Gap\n                                       \n\n          The  district  court  made clear  that  its  basic\n\nobjective  in assessing a fine in the amount of $634,000 was\n\nto  fill a gap  -- the gap  between the value  of the assets\n\nforfeited and  the  $2.8 million  Plea Agreement  \"ceiling.\"\n\nMaling  says the  district court  was mistaken  in believing\n\nthere was such a gap.   In particular, he says, the  gap was\n\nfilled,  without   the  fine,   by  1)  his   forfeiture  of\n\ncondominiums  owned  by J  &amp; R  Properties, Inc.,  valued at\n\n$300,000,  and 2)  his forfeiture  of property  in Westwood,\n\nvalued at  $335,000.  The  Government refuses to  accept the\n\ncondominiums;  it agrees that  Maling forfeited the Westwood\n\nproperty after entry  of the $634,000 judgment  and that the\n\njudgment must  be modified to  take its value  into account.\n\n(The  district court  expressly left  the judgment  open for\n\nsixty  days so that it  could be modified.)   The Government\n\ndisagrees, however, about the value of that property.  \n\n          The upshot is that the  Government believes Maling\n\nmust pay a fine  of $344,000, while Maling believes  he need\n\nnot  pay any  fine  at all.    The difference  reflects  the\n\ndisagreements about whether the Government must accept the J\n\n&amp; R condominiums (worth $300,000) and about the value of the\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nWestwood property (the difference in valuations amounting to\n\n$45,000).\n\n          Before turning to the  disagreements, we point out\n\nthat the district court has broad legal powers to  determine\n\nthe amount of  the fine.  See Fed.  R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B);\n                             \n\nMaling I, 942  F.2d at  810 (court not  bound by  sentencing\n        \n\nrecommendations derived from Plea Agreement) (citing cases);\n\n21 U.S.C.   848(a)  (authorizing a fine of up  to $2 million\n\nfor one  of the  offenses of  which  Maling was  convicted);\n\nU.S.S.G.     5E1.2(c)(4)   (Sentencing  Guidelines  do   not\n\nconstrain fines where statute  authorizes fines in excess of\n\n$250,000); United States v.

The  court  was  not  legally\n\ncompelled to limit  its fine to the size  of the gap (though\n\nit quite reasonably chose  to do so).  Similarly,  the court\n\nwas  not legally required to measure the gap precisely or to\n\nengage  in  professional   matters  of  appraisal  or   make\n\ntechnical  property law determinations in doing so.  The law\n\nwould permit the court to assess  its fine on the basis of a\n\nrough estimate of the gap size, or on an assumption that the\n\nGovernment would  probably, but not definitely, win disputed\n                                              \n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\nmatters in respect to what was, or what was not, forfeitable\n\nunder  the Plea Agreement.   For this reason,  we review the\n\ndistrict court's judgments about \"gap size\" with a degree of\n\ndeference.\n\n          a. The  J &amp; R  Condominiums.  Maling  must concede\n                                      \n\nthat  there is  a $300,000  gap, for,  in fact,  he  has not\n\nforfeited  the J &amp; R  condominiums.  Rather,  he argues that\n\nthe Government  should have  accepted  the condominiums  for\n                           \n\nforfeiture, and the district  court should have assessed the\n\nfine  as if the government had done  so.  His claim that the\n           \n\nGovernment  had to  accept the  condominiums stems  from the\n\nPlea Agreement, which says that  the parties will enter into\n\na \"separate agreement\"  that \"specifically describe[s]\"  the\n\n\"property  and  assets\" to  be  forfeited.   That  \"separate\n\nagreement\"  (as we have said)  lists the J  &amp; R condominiums\n\namong  those  assets.     Consequently,  says  Maling,   the\n\nGovernment, having signed this \"separate  agreement,\" cannot\n\nlater reject the assets that it listed.\n\n          The Plea Agreement, however, contains an important\n\nqualification.  It says  that \"physical assets\" will satisfy\n\nthe \"forfeiture\"  obligation only if  those physical  assets\n\nare  \"without any encumbrances.\"  This qualification affects\n\nthe \"separate agreement\" subsequently  made pursuant to  the\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nPlea Agreement.   Thus,  we read the  Government's September\n\n1990 agreement,  accepting the forfeiture of  \"[a]ny and all\n                                                            \n\ninterest  of J &amp; R  Properties, Inc.\" (our  emphasis) in the\n\ncondominiums  (not  merely  the  \"interest\"  of  Maling)  as\n\nconditioned on  the  condominiums' being  unencumbered  when\n\nforfeited.  As we  have said, after the parties  signed that\n\n\"separate agreement\" and  after Maling (as J &amp; R's President\n\nand Treasurer) purported to convey the J &amp; R condominiums to\n\nthe Government (but before  the forfeiture order was final),\n\nMaling's J &amp;  R co-owner  James Taglienti  filed a  petition\n\nwith the court, under  21 U.S.C.   853(n), objecting  to the\n\nforfeiture  on  the  ground  that he  had  a  fifty  percent\n\ninterest  in the  condominiums.   The  Government asked  the\n\ncourt  to omit  the condominiums  from its  final forfeiture\n\norder because it considered the petition an \"encumbrance.\"\n\n          Maling  argues that  neither the  petition  (nor a\n\nlater-filed  state tax  lien,  which we  need not  consider)\n\namounts  to   an  \"encumbrance.\"     First,  he   says  that\n\nTaglienti's petition is without legal  merit, for Taglienti,\n\ntoo,  was   involved  in  (or  knew   about)  relevant  drug\n\nactivities, which involvement would prevent him from  saving\n\nhis interests  in the condominiums from forfeiture.   See 21\n                                                         \n\nU.S.C.    853(c), (n)(6).  He adds that, even if Taglienti's\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\npetition is otherwise  valid, the Government  received title\n\ndocuments from J  &amp; R's President and Treasurer  (Maling) in\n\n\"good faith,\" which fact, under Massachusetts law, means the\n\nGovernment   takes  title   free  of   Taglienti's  asserted\n\ninterests.

We read  the phrase\n\n\"without any  encumbrances\" as  one who buys  property would\n\nlikely  read it,  namely  as imposing  upon the  conveyer an\n\nobligation  to clear up any  asserted legal claims upon that\n\nproperty prior to transfer, so  that the buyer will  receive\n\nthe property alone, instead  of receiving \"the property plus\n\nthe obligation  to fight  a lawsuit\" (regardless  of whether\n\nthe  lawsuit ultimately  turns out  to  be unfounded).   See\n                                                            \n\nAmerican Law of Property   18.84 (A.

Since a court\n\nwill not compel a purchaser to 'buy a lawsuit,' the pendency\n\nof  one  of the  character  indicated  is an  encumbrance.\")\n\n(citations omitted).   Such  a reading would  avoid imposing\n\nupon the Government title-clearing obligations  that it does\n\nnot wish  to  undertake, without  (ordinarily)  harming  the\n\npotential  transferor  (who  simply  would  retain  whatever\n\nproperty interest  he previously  owned).  Maling  points to\n\nnothing that  might suggest that this natural reading of the\n\nagreement is incorrect.  \n\n          Such a  reading ends the argument.   To adjudicate\n\nthe  merits  of  Taglienti's  claim would  require  a  legal\n\nproceeding (perhaps a rather  complicated one), as would any\n\neffort to  demonstrate that  the Government (which  had long\n\nknown  that Taglienti  was Maling's  J &amp;  R co-owner)  was a\n\n\"good  faith\" transferee entitled to  clear title in all the\n\nproperty, irrespective  of the merits of  Taglienti's claim.\n                      \n\nSee Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 155,   8; ch.  156B,   115 (requiring\n   \n\n\"good faith\" for transferee  of real estate from corporation\n\nto take free of rights of owners of corporation).  Hence, we\n\nsee nothing unlawful about the district court construing the\n\nPlea  Agreement's word  \"encumbrance\"  as  encompassing  the\n\nTaglienti petition.\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\n          Maling   also  claims   that  the   Government  is\n\n\"estopped\"   from  refusing  to   accept  the  condominiums.\n\nEstoppel, however, requires a statement or promise or action\n\nthat leads to reasonable reliance to one's detriment.   See,\n                                                           \n\ne.g., Restatement  (Second) of Contracts    90(1) (1981) (\"A\n                                        \n\npromise  which  the  promisor  should  reasonably expect  to\n\ninduce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee . .\n\n.  and  which  does  induce such  action  or  forbearance is\n                                                         \n\nbinding if injustice can  be avoided only by enforcement  of\n\nthe promise.\") (emphasis added).  We cannot find a statement\n\nor action by the Government, in respect to the condominiums,\n\nthat led Maling reasonably  to rely to his detriment  on the\n\nGovernment's keeping the  condominiums despite a  pre-final-\n\norder   \"encumbrance\"  which,  under   the  plea  agreement,\n\nentitled it  to reject them.   The  Government, we  concede,\n\nknew (as, of course, did Maling) that Taglienti was a  J &amp; R\n    \n\nco-owner  long  before  the  condominiums  appeared  on  the\n\n\"separate agreement\" forfeiture list.  But, Maling points to\n\nno statement  or action  that suggests that  the Government,\n\nrather than Maling, was  responsible for preventing any such\n                                    \n\nlegal  \"cloud\"  upon  the  property  from  arising,  or  for\n\nremoving  it  once  it arose.    We  also  concede that  the\n\nGovernment,  for   a   time,  accepted   condominium   rents\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\n(presumably  because  it anticipated  that  forfeiture would\n\ntransfer  the property  to the  Government  with retroactive\n\neffect, 21 U.S.C.   853(c)).   But, we do not see how Maling\n\nis  any the  worse  for its  having  done so  (assuming,  of\n\ncourse,  that the Government pays  over to him  the rents it\n\nreceived).    That  is  to  say,  we  do  not  see  how  the\n\nGovernment's   returning   the    property   makes    Maling\n                        \n\nsignificantly  worse  off  than  had  the  Government  never\n\nincluded the  property on  the \"separate agreement\"  list in\n        \n\nthe first place.   The district court could  reasonably have\n\nfound  no \"reliance to  his detriment\" on  Maling's part and\n\ntherefore no \"estoppel.\"\n\n          Maling's  strongest argument is  that he wanted to\n                                                         \n\nclear Taglienti's \"encumbrance;\" indeed, he asked the  court\n\nto permit him  to prove that Taglienti  was not the kind  of\n\n\"good  faith\"   or  innocent  owner  who   could  object  to\n\nforfeiture of  his own  (i.e., Taglienti's) interest  in the\n\nproperty.    See  21 U.S.C.     853(n)(6).    But, once  the\n                \n\nGovernment  told  the  court  that  it   did  not  want  the\n\ncondominiums,  the court simply  denied Maling's  request as\n\n\"moot.\"  Maling,  in essence, asks, \"How  can the Government\n\nturn  down the  property  as encumbered  without letting  me\n\nremove the encumbrance?\"  \n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\n          The short, conclusive answer to this question lies\n\nin  the Plea Agreement itself.   It says  the Government can\n\nturn  down  encumbered  property.    It  does  not  say  the\n\nGovernment  must   give  Maling   a  chance  to   remove  an\n\nencumbrance.  And, we  will not read  such a right into  the\n\nAgreement, at least, in  respect to this kind of  removal of\n                                             \n\nan  encumbrance.    Maling  does  not  offer  to  show  that\n\nTaglienti  does not own the  property.  Rather,  he wants to\n                       \n\nintervene  in the  special  statutory  \"third  party  versus\n\nGovernment\" proceedings  to show  that the  Government could\n                                                            \n\ndefeat  Taglienti's interest, if it decided to try to do so.\n\n21  U.S.C.   853(c), (n)(6).  But, the statute creates those\n\nspecial  proceedings,  placing  a  special  burden on  third\n\nparties to prove that  they have \"clean hands,\" in  order to\n\nbenefit the Government.  See S.

Thus, we think\n\nthe court  acted lawfully  in denying Maling's  petition for\n\nsuch a proceeding.\n\n          Is this result unfair to Maling?  One  can imagine\n\ncircumstances  that could  make it  seem so.    Suppose, for\n\nexample,   that  the  Government,  knowing  full  well  that\n\nTaglienti would  likely create an encumbrance  (i.e., file a\n\npetition objecting  to the  forfeiture) led Maling  down the\n\ngarden  path.   On the  other hand,  one can  easily imagine\n\ncircumstances  that  indicate the  contrary.    Suppose, for\n\nexample,  that the Government  assumed that  Taglienti would\n\nnot  object  (or  that  Maling could  persuade  him  not  to\n\nobject); or, suppose that the Government did not think about\n\nthe  matter and Maling simply  saw a fleeting opportunity to\n\nsatisfy a portion of his debt with  someone else's property.\n\nRegardless, this kind of  ultimate fairness or unfairness to\n\nMaling would arise out  of facts and circumstances  of which\n\nwe  know  little.    And,  it is  beside  the  point.    The\n\nGovernment and  Maling signed  an Agreement the  language of\n\nwhich placed the  risk of this,  and any other,  encumbrance\n\nupon Maling.   In all likelihood the  Government wanted this\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nlanguage so that it would not have to become involved in the\n\nkind of  property law disagreements that  Maling now raises.\n\nThe district court  so interpreted the Agreement.   It based\n\nits  fine  upon  that  interpretation.    In  our  view, the\n\ndistrict court's view is  reasonable; and the resulting fine\n\nis therefore lawful.\n\n          b. The Westwood Property.  Maling argues about the\n                                   \n\nvalue of his forfeited Westwood property, property which was\n\nnot included in the September 1990 \"separate agreement\" list\n\nand which he offered to forfeit for the first  time in about\n\nSeptember 1991.   An  appraisal made about  seventeen months\n\nearlier (before  the plea agreement) valued  the property at\n\n$335,000.  By late 1991, when Maling offered the property to\n\nthe Government,  its value  had declined  to $245,000.   The\n\nGovernment told  the court  that, for purposes  of assessing\n\nthe  \"gap-filling\" fine,  it would  assume the  property was\n\nworth  $290,000, thereby \"splitting  the difference\" between\n\nthe two evaluations.\n\n          Maling argues that he  should be credited with the\n\nhigher  valuation.   But,  we can  find  no promise  by  the\n\nGovernment that it would do so.  And, in the absence of such\n\na  promise, we  are aware of  no law that  would prevent the\n\nGovernment from advising the  court that the property should\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nbe assessed at $290,000 for \"gap-filling\"  purposes.  In the\n\nabsence of  some specific  agreement about valuation  dates,\n\n\"splitting the difference\" does not seem unreasonable to us;\n\nand we do  not know why  the district  court could not  have\n\nreached a similar conclusion.\n\n                            -17-\n                             17\n\n                            III\n\n                    Recommending a Fine\n                                       \n\n          The Plea  Agreement, while leaving the  court free\n\nto impose a fine,  nonetheless prohibits the Government from\n\nrecommending  a fine.   See  Maling I,  942 F.2d  at 810-11.\n                                     \n\nMaling says  that  the Government  violated this  obligation\n\nwhen counsel told the district court, for example: \n\n          If the Court is entertaining the thought\n          of a fine,  my suggestion  in [sic]  how\n          that should  be fashioned . .  . is that\n          the Court  should  issue an  order of  a\n          criminal fine in the amount of $634,000.\n\nTaken  out of context, this statement, and a few others like\n\nit, might suggest a not-very-subtle attempt to avoid the \"no\n\nrecommendation\"  obligation.  Cf.  United States  v. Canada,\n                                                           \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580702\"><a href=\"/opinion/580702/united-states-v-barney-canada-aka-byron-levon-canada/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 269  (1st Cir. 1992)  (we will not  allow the\n\nGovernment to pay \"lip service\" to a plea agreement and then\n\ndo  \"end-runs\" around it).   But, in context, the statements\n\nare perfectly proper.\n\n          The context  reveals that  the district  court had\n\nalready  decided to impose a  fine despite the  absence of a\n\nfine recommendation.  The context makes clear that the court\n\nwanted, or could  benefit from, discussion, recommendations,\n\nand argument from all counsel, about the amount of fine that\n                     \n\nwould  keep the  total  monetary liability  within the  $2.8\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\nmillion \"ceiling.\"  Government counsel, stating specifically\n\nthat  the \"U.S. Government is not recommending to this Court\n\nthat they [sic]  impose a fine,\" went  on to respond  to the\n\ncourt's request to  help it determine  the proper amount  of\n\nthe fine that the court independently had decided to impose.\n\nWe see no violation of the Plea Agreement.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is\n\n          Affirmed.\n                   \n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n</pre>",
