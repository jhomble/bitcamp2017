Defendant Clyde Tse was convicted\n\nof distributing cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).                          In\n\nevaluating one of his claims on appeal relating to a limitation on\n\nthe cross-examination of the government's principal witness, we\n\nmust    address     the   important      differences      in      analysis   between\n\nadmitting a prior conviction to impeach a defendant's testimony and\n\nadmitting    such    a    conviction     to    impeach      the    testimony       of   a\n\ngovernment witness.        We must also address Tse's challenges to the\n\nadmission    of    evidence     of   a   subsequent      drug     transaction,      the\n\nadequacy of the district court's limiting instructions about that\n\ntransaction, two additional limitations on his ability to impeach\n\nthe    testimony    of    the   principal      government       witness,     and    the\n\nadmission of allegedly prejudicial testimony by that witness.\n\nAfter full consideration of these issues, we affirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            On November 24, 1998, agents of the Drug Enforcement\n\nAgency (DEA) attempted to record a drug transaction between Tse and\n\na cooperating witness, Stephen Williams.              The DEA agents outfitted\n\nWilliams with an audio transmitter called a \"kel.\" The device\n\nallowed     the     agents      to   listen     to    and       record   Williams's\n\nconversations, but did not allow them to communicate with Williams.\n\nAfter searching Williams and his car to ensure that he did not have\n\nany drugs or cash, the agents gave him $450 and instructed him to\n\npurchase crack cocaine from Tse.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f            At approximately 6:30 P.M., Williams drove to Tse's\n\nresidence in Mattapan, Massachusetts. The DEA recorded the ensuing\n\nconversation in which Williams told Tse that he had only $450 and\n\nthat he wanted to buy a half ounce of crack cocaine for that\n\namount. Tse told Williams to return in ten minutes.   Williams left\n\nTse's residence and again met with the DEA agents. They instructed\n\nhim to return to Tse's house to make the drug purchase.          At\n\napproximately 7:10 P.M. Williams returned to Tse's house where Tse\n\nwas on the phone, apparently receiving directions to a nearby\n\nlocation.   After the phone call, Tse told Williams \"we're on,\" and\n\nsaid that they needed to travel \"just around the corner.\"    Tse and\n\nWilliams left the house and entered Williams's car.\n\n            As Williams and Tse drove off, the DEA agents lost the\n\nsignal from Williams's kel transmitter.   Despite their attempts to\n\nfollow Williams, the agents were not able to record any other\n\nconversations between Williams and Tse that evening.        However,\n\nshortly after Williams and Tse drove off, a member of the DEA\n\nsurveillance team saw Williams's car parked on a nearby street,\n\nonly a few blocks from Tse's residence.    At least one person was\n\nsitting in the car.\n\n            At trial, Williams testified that he and Tse drove to a\n\nhouse only a few minutes away.   Williams remained in the car while\n\nTse spoke with a man in the doorway and entered the building.\n\nAccording to Williams, Tse returned several minutes later and gave\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fa bag of crack cocaine to Williams.     Williams and Tse then drove\n\nback to Tse's house, where Tse gave Williams a scrap of paper with\n\nTse's pager number written on it.\n\n            After Williams dropped Tse off at his residence, he met\n\nwith the DEA agents and handed over the drugs and the scrap of\n\npaper on which Tse had written his pager number.      DEA laboratory\n\ntests confirmed that the drugs that Tse had allegedly supplied to\n\nWilliams included 11.2 grams of crack cocaine.\n\n            On February 2, 1999, Williams again participated in a DEA\n\noperation targeting Tse.     He used the pager number that Tse had\n\ngiven him after the previous transaction to contact Tse.        In a\n\nrecorded call, Williams and Tse spoke in a mutually understood code\n\nabout a drug transaction.    Tse agreed to sell 62 grams of cocaine\n\nto Williams for $1,800.     Williams was again outfitted with a kel\n\ntransmitter, and DEA agents followed Williams to the meeting place\n\nwith Tse.      When Tse arrived, he provided Williams with powder\n\ncocaine.    This time, the DEA agents were able to record the entire\n\ntransaction.\n\n            On September 27, 2000, a grand jury charged Tse with two\n\ncounts of distributing a controlled substance in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1).     Count one alleged that Tse had distributed\n\ncrack cocaine during the November 24 transaction; count two alleged\n\nthat Tse had distributed powder cocaine during the February 2\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\ftransaction.    On December 12, 2000, Tse pled guilty to count two\n\nand proceeded to a jury trial on count one.\n\n           Because the DEA agents had been unable to record the\n\nNovember   24   transaction,   the   government   relied   heavily    on\n\nWilliams's testimony to describe the events of that evening.\n\nWilliams was not an ideal witness, and Tse's primary strategy was\n\nto discredit Williams's testimony.     Through both direct and cross-\n\nexamination, the jury heard, inter alia, that Williams had used and\n\nsold drugs in the past, had been convicted of at least one crime,\n\nhad made inaccurate statements to the grand jury about his prior\n\ninvolvement with drugs,1 had received substantial compensation for\n\nhis work as a DEA informant, and had purchased a new car shortly\n\nafter receiving payments from the DEA.\n\n           The trial lasted four days, ending on December 15, 2000.\n\nDespite Tse's aggressive impeachment of Williams's testimony,        the\n\njury found Tse guilty of distributing a controlled substance during\n\nthe November 24 transaction. On April 25, 2001, the district court\n\nsentenced Tse to 120 months in prison on each count (as noted, he\n\nhad pled guilty to count two of the indictment) to be served\n\nconcurrently.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Before the grand jury, Williams testified that he had never\nsold crack cocaine and that he had used marijuana only once. On\ncross-examination Williams admitted that those statements were not\ncorrect and that he had sold crack cocaine and had used marijuana\non several occasions.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f             On appeal, Tse claims that the district court made a\n\nnumber of errors.     First, Tse argues that the district court erred\n\nin admitting evidence of the February transaction.       Second, Tse\n\nargues that the court gave inadequate limiting instructions to the\n\njury about the proper use of evidence of the February transaction.\n\nThird, he argues that the district court erred in limiting his\n\ncross-examination of Williams by preventing him from (1) impeaching\n\nWilliams's credibility by introducing evidence that Williams had\n\nbeen convicted of assault and battery against a police officer, (2)\n\nintroducing evidence that charges against Williams stemming from a\n\ntraffic stop were dismissed after Williams began cooperating with\n\nthe DEA, and (3) refreshing Williams's memory with an employment\n\napplication he had filled out several years earlier.    Finally, Tse\n\nargues that the district court impermissibly allowed the government\n\nto solicit prejudicial evidence from Williams during redirect\n\nexamination.     We address each of Tse's arguments in turn, relating\n\nthe relevant details of the trial where appropriate.\n\n                                  II.\n\n             At trial, the government sought to introduce evidence of\n\nthe February transaction, arguing that such evidence had \"special\n\nrelevance\" under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).2    The government\n\n\n     2\n         Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) states:\n\n\"Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to\nprove the character of a person in order to show action in\nconformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other\n\n                                  -6-\n\foffered several theories of admissibility.                 First, it argued that\n\nthe February transaction demonstrated Tse's intent in meeting with\n\nWilliams on November 24.         Because Tse had argued in his opening\n\nstatement that his November meeting with Williams did not involve\n\na drug transaction, the government reasoned that evidence of Tse's\n\nintent was at issue in the case.3             Second, the government argued\n\nthat the February evidence was admissible to boost Williams's\n\ncredibility      since   the    February      transaction       was    similar   to\n\nWilliams's description of the November transaction.                    Third, the\n\ngovernment argued that tape of the February transaction showed that\n\nTse had sold drugs to Williams on previous occasions because, when\n\nWilliams called to arrange the February deal, both he and Tse began\n\nspeaking about the transaction in a mutually understood code\n\nwithout an initial discussion of whether Tse could procure drugs.\n\nFinally,   the    government     argued     that     the   February    transaction\n\ndemonstrated a \"criminal association\" between Tse and Williams,\n\ncreating an      inference     that,   if    their    purpose    for   meeting   on\n\nFebruary 2 was to carry out a drug transaction, their purpose for\n\n\n\n\npurposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or\naccident . . . .\"\n     3\n      At trial, Tse did not testify and did not offer any other\nwitnesses or evidence in his defense. Rather, during his opening\nstatement, Tse's counsel claimed that Tse's association with\nWilliams was innocent, stating that Tse \"didn't sell crack to\nStephen Williams, couldn't sell crack to Stephen Williams on\nNovember 24, 1998, or any other day.\"\n\n                                       -7-\n\fmeeting   on   November   24   was   likely   to   carry   out   a   similar\n\ntransaction.\n\n           Tse objected that evidence of the February transaction\n\nhad no special relevance because he had admitted that he and\n\nWilliams were together on November 24 during the time of the\n\nalleged drug transaction.      He argued that there was therefore no\n\nneed to admit evidence to demonstrate the relationship between\n\nWilliams and Tse.     Rather, evidence of the February transaction\n\ncould only be used by the jury to draw a forbidden propensity\n\ninference: if Tse had sold drugs to Williams on February 2, he\n\nlikely sold drugs to Williams on November 24.\n\n           After hearing arguments on this issue, the district court\n\nadmitted the evidence, ruling that the evidence had \"special\n\nrelevance\" within the scope of Rule 404(b) because it demonstrated\n\nthat Tse and Williams had a \"criminal association\" in February.4\n\nThe court did not specify the probative value of this \"criminal\n\nassociation,\" stating only that the criminal association was \"one\n\nthat the government may have evidence of.\"          The court also ruled\n\nthat the probative value of the February transaction was not\n\nsubstantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.              Thus, the\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      While   the   court   admitted   evidence   supporting   the\nprosecution's claim that Tse had sold cocaine to Williams in\nFebruary, neither the court nor the prosecution told the jury that\nTse had already pled guilty to charges stemming from the February\ntransaction.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fcourt ruled that evidence of the February transaction was not\n\nbarred by Rule 403.5     The defense objected to these rulings.\n\n             We review for abuse of discretion the district court's\n\ndetermination that prior bad act evidence was admissible pursuant\n\nto Rules 404(b) and 403.    See United States v. Varoudakis, 233 F.3d\n\n113, 118 (1st Cir. 2000).     A district court may admit evidence of\n\na defendant's other bad acts only if that evidence meets the\n\nrequirements of both Rule 404(b) and Rule 403.      To be admissible\n\nunder Rule 404(b), \"the evidence must have 'special relevance' to\n\nan issue in the case such as intent or knowledge, and must not\n\ninclude 'bad character or propensity as a necessary link in the\n\ninferential chain.'\" Varoudakis, 233 F.3d at 118 (quoting United\n\nStates v. Frankenhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir. 1996)); see\n\nalso United States v. Escobar-De Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 169 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (permitting the introduction of bad act evidence \"if the\n\nevidence is relevant for purposes other than proof of a defendant's\n\nbad character or criminal propensity\").     Second, pursuant to Rule\n\n403, the probative value of the bad act evidence must not be\n\n\"substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\" Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 403; see also Varoudakis, 233 F.3d at 118.    A trial court\n\n\n     5\n         Federal Rule of Evidence 403 states:\n\n\"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value\nis substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\nconfusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\nconsiderations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless\npresentation of cumulative evidence.\"\n\n                                  -9-\n\fmay   admit    evidence         of   other    bad   acts      indicating     a   criminal\n\nassociation even when the evidence describes an event that occurred\n\nlater than the charged crime.                United States v. Procopio, 88 F.3d\n\n21, 29 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"A later criminal association increases the\n\nlikelihood     of    an     earlier    one--which        is    all   that    'relevance'\n\nrequires . . . and numerous cases permit such reasoning from a\n\nlater event or condition to an earlier one.\")(citations omitted).\n\n              In a conspiracy case, the district court may admit\n\nevidence of other bad acts if they tend to suggest a criminal\n\nassociation between the alleged conspirators.                        See Procopio, 88\n\nF.3d at 29.     Evidence of a criminal association among the alleged\n\nconspirators        can    be   probative      in   several      respects.        It    can\n\ndemonstrate the background of a relationship, a collaboration among\n\nseveral parties, or a mutual trust between conspirators.                                See\n\nVaroudakis, 233 F.3d at 121 (admitting evidence of a prior bad act\n\nto    demonstrate         mutual     trust     between        alleged    conspirators);\n\nEscobar-De Jesus, 187 F.3d at 169 (\"[E]vidence of other bad acts .\n\n. . can be admitted to explain the background, formation and\n\ndevelopment     of        the   illegal       relationship       .   .   .   and,      more\n\nspecifically, to help the jury understand the basis for the co-\n\nconspirators' relationship of mutual trust . . . .\")(citations\n\nomitted); Procopio, 88 F.3d at 29 (stating that evidence of a\n\nsubsequent criminal association \"was helpful to the government's\n\nclaim that the two men had collaborated\" in a prior robbery).                            It\n\n\n                                             -10-\n\fcan also rebut a defendant's claim that his association with the\n\nalleged conspirators was innocent. See United States v. Rodriguez,\n\n215 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"In particular, the government's\n\nevidence     must    overcome    the    possibility       that   a   particular\n\ndefendant's association with criminal co-conspirators was wholly\n\ninnocent or that, if he was with them at the scene of criminal\n\nactivity, he was 'merely present,' without guilty knowledge or\n\nintent.\").\n\n           Tse      argues   that,   because   he   was    not   charged   with\n\nconspiracy, his collaboration with other parties is not at issue.\n\nWe disagree.     Tse's defense--that he was with Williams on November\n\n24 but that he did not participate in a drug transaction on that\n\nday--makes Tse's relationship with Williams \"directly in issue and\n\nmaterial to the case\" and thus permits the court to admit evidence\n\nof a subsequent criminal association.          Escobar-De Jesus, 187 F.3d\n\nat 169.    See also Rodriguez, 215 F.3d at 119 (holding admissible\n\nevidence of another of defendant's drug ventures with the same\n\nparticipants to rebut defendant's claim that, on the occasion of\n\nthe charged crime, he was an innocent bystander); United States v.\n\nLopez, 340 F.3d 169, 174 (3d Cir. 2003) (following decisions\n\n\"upholding the admission of evidence of prior drug involvement for\n\nthe purpose of rebutting defense claims of innocent association\");\n\nUnited States v. Ruiz-Estrada, 312 F.3d 398, 403 (8th Cir. 2002)\n\n(admitting other act evidence to rebut defendant's defense that he\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fwas \"merely present\" in an apartment that contained evidence of a\n\ndrug conspiracy).\n\n             In this case, the court properly admitted evidence of the\n\nFebruary transaction to refute Tse's claim that his meeting with\n\nWilliams in November was innocent.                Evidence of the February\n\ntransaction between Williams and Tse, including their use of coded\n\nlanguage,     indicated   that   they       had   collaborated    on   similar\n\ntransactions in the past and that they both understood the nature\n\nof   their   meeting.     Although    the    government   did    not   have   to\n\ndemonstrate an agreement, as it would have in a conspiracy case,\n\nthis evidence was still critical to demonstrate the nature of Tse's\n\nassociation with Williams, which helped to refute Tse's claim that\n\ntheir November meeting was innocent.\n\n             Evidence of other bad acts always carries with it a\n\ndanger of a forbidden propensity inference.                But Rule 404(b)\n\nrequires only that there be some other permissible reason, subject\n\nto the requirements of Rule 403, to admit the evidence.                  Here,\n\nevidence of the February transaction refuted Tse's claim that his\n\nassociation with Williams was innocent.            Thus, the district court\n\nproperly admitted the evidence under Rule 404(b).6\n\n\n\n      6\n      After finding that evidence of the February transaction was\nadmissible under Rule 404(b), the district court also found that it\nwas admissible under the balancing test of Rule 403. On appeal,\nTse has not offered any argument challenging the district court's\nruling on the admissibility of the February evidence under Rule\n403.\n\n                                     -12-\n\f                                       III.\n\n            After   ruling     on    the    admissibility    of   the   February\n\nevidence,    the    district        court     gave   the   following    limiting\n\ninstruction to the jury:\n\n            The defendant is charged in this indictment\n            with an offense said to have occurred on\n            November 24, 1998. The government is offering\n            evidence of another transaction in February of\n            1999 [that] the defendant is not charged with\n            in this case. The evidence is offered as it\n            may bear on your assessment of whether the\n            government's case regarding the November\n            incident is sufficient or not, including\n            whether the government has established that\n            the defendant knowingly and intentionally\n            participated in a drug transaction on November\n            24, as alleged in the indictment.          The\n            evidence of the other incident may or may not,\n            in your judgment, support a conclusion that he\n            was a participant in such a transaction in\n            November.   The February '99 incident, if it\n            occurred, if you find that it occurred, which\n            is the first question, and if you do, you may\n            consider it for that purpose if it bears on\n            the   defendant's   knowing  and   intentional\n            participation in a similar transaction in\n            November. You may not consider it as evidence\n            if it were that of the defendant's character\n            or general propensity to be involved in\n            criminal activity. This is not evidence about\n            the defendant or his instincts or propensity.\n            It is evidence that may or may not, as you\n            judge appropriate, be used in considering what\n            inferences you might make about the evidence\n            concerning the November transaction.\n\nFollowing this instruction, the government solicited testimony from\n\none of the DEA agents who monitored the February transaction, and\n\nplayed an audio tape of that transaction.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f             Tse objected that the court's limiting instruction did\n\nnot state that the jury \"can only use [evidence of the February\n\ntransaction] for the very specific purpose that the government has\n\nsuggested here, which is that there is some kind of relationship\n\nbetween [Williams and Tse].\"               The court responded that \"I don't\n\nwant to be arguing the government's case, so I don't want to\n\nsuggest     there's    a    connection.\"           The   court    then    noted       Tse's\n\nobjection.\n\n             On appeal, Tse challenges the adequacy of the district\n\ncourt's limiting instructions to the jury.                      Upon request by the\n\ndefendant,     a   district        court    must    instruct      the    jury    on     the\n\npermissible use of other bad act evidence admitted against the\n\ndefendant.

Palmer, 203 F.3d 55, 59 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (\"The district court has considerable leeway as to the\n\nphrasing and timing of a curative instruction.\").                  Because Tse\n\nobjected below to the formulation of the instruction, \"our review\n\nis for abuse of discretion 'to determine whether the instructions\n\nadequately explained the law or whether they tended to confuse or\n\nmislead the jury on the controlling issues.'\"              United States v.\n\nRanney, 298 F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir. 2002) (citations omitted); see\n\nalso United States v. Picciandra, 788 F.2d 39, 46 (1st Cir. 1986)\n\n(\"We review the propriety of instructions to a jury under the abuse\n\nof discretion standard.\")\n\n           The court's instruction adequately limited the jury's\n\nconsideration     of   the   February     evidence.       First,    the    court\n\nspecifically instructed that \"[y]ou may not consider it as evidence\n\nif it were that of the defendant's character or general propensity\n\nto be involved in criminal activity.            This is not evidence about\n\nthe defendant or his instincts or propensity.\"             Second, the court\n\nidentified the proper use for evidence of the February transaction:\n\n\"The evidence of the other incident may or may not, in your\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fjudgment, support a conclusion that [Tse] was a participant in such\n\na transaction in November. . . . [Y]ou may consider [the February\n\nevidence] for that purpose if it bears on the defendant's knowing\n\nand   intentional    participation   in   a   similar   transaction   in\n\nNovember.\"     Thus, the court instructed the jury that it could not\n\nuse evidence of the February transaction to make a propensity\n\ninference and that it should use the evidence only to determine\n\nTse's knowledge and intent at the time of the alleged November\n\ntransaction.8     We find no abuse of discretion in the court's\n\ninstruction.\n\n             At the end of the trial, prior to jury deliberations, the\n\ncourt again offered a limiting instruction regarding evidence of\n\nthe February transaction:\n\n             You may not consider evidence of the February\n             1999 transaction as indicating that the\n             defendant is of bad character and therefore\n             someone who had an inclination or propensity\n             to commit the crime that's charged. A person\n             may not be convicted of having a bad character\n             or inclination. He may only be convicted if\n             you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt\n             that he committed the offense as alleged in\n             the indictment.\n\n\n      8\n      While the court admitted evidence of the February transaction\nas probative of Tse's \"criminal association\" with Williams, it\ninstructed the jury to use the February evidence only to determine\nTse's \"knowing and intentional participation\" in the November\ntransaction. Tse has not argued that this difference rendered the\ninstruction inadequate.    Moreover, both of these rationales are\nvariations on the same theme: that Tse's relationship with Williams\nwas not innocent. Thus, it is not important to our analysis that\nthe judge spoke in his instruction about \"knowing and intentional\nparticipation\" rather than about a \"criminal association.\"\n\n                                  -17-\n\fAlthough Tse objected to some portions of the instructions given\n\nprior to jury deliberation, he did not object to the portion of\n\nthose instructions concerning evidence of the February transaction.\n\nHe raises an objection to this instruction for the first time on\n\nappeal.\n\n                  \"When an objection to a jury instruction is forfeited, we\n\napply the plain error standard.\"                Connelly v. Hyundai Motor Corp.,\n\n351 F.3d 535, 545 (1st Cir. 2003).                    Relief under the plain error\n\nstandard requires (1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that is\n\nlikely       to    alter     the   outcome,     and    (4)    that   is   sufficiently\n\nfundamental          to    threaten     the    fairness,      integrity,    or    public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings. Id.\n\n                  The court's instruction on other bad act evidence at the\n\nend of the trial only told the jury that it must not use evidence\n\nof the February transaction to draw a propensity inference. Unlike\n\nthe earlier instruction just before the evidence was admitted, this\n\ninstruction did not tell the jury the limited purpose for which it\n\nshould use that evidence.               While it would have been preferable for\n\nthe trial judge to use the more complete instruction again, the\n\nplain error standard cannot be met.                   The jury had previously been\n\ngiven    a    full        instruction    on    the   proper   use    of   the   February\n\nevidence.          We cannot conclude that the failure to specify proper\n\nuse of the February evidence during the second instruction altered\n\nthe outcome of this trial in any way.\n\n\n                                              -18-\n\f                                         IV.\n\n            \"Confrontation Clause challenges are reviewed de novo in\n\norder to verify that the trial court afforded the defendant a\n\nreasonable opportunity to impeach adverse witnesses.                    When that\n\nconstitutional threshold is crossed, we examine the trial court's\n\nrestrictions on the manner and extent of cross-examination for\n\nabuse of discretion.\"        United States v. Perez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 11\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Tse argues that the district court impermissibly limited\n\nhis cross-examination of Williams on three occasions.                   First, the\n\ncourt did     not    allow   Tse    to    impeach    Williams    with   Williams's\n\nprevious conviction for assault and battery against a police\n\nofficer. Second, the court did not permit Tse to offer evidence of\n\ncharges against Williams, later dismissed, stemming from a traffic\n\nstop on September 6, 1998.               Tse sought to use these charges to\n\ndemonstrate that Williams had a motive to cooperate with the\n\ngovernment.       Finally, the court did not allow Tse to attack\n\nWilliams's credibility by demonstrating that Williams had made\n\nfalse statements on an employment application.                   We address each\n\nargument in turn.\n\nA. Conviction for Assault and Battery Against a Police Officer\n\n            Tse     attempted      to    impeach    Williams's   credibility    by\n\nintroducing evidence of Williams's prior conviction for assault and\n\nbattery against a police officer (ABPO).                At first, the district\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fcourt agreed that the evidence was admissible pursuant to Federal\n\nRule of Evidence 609(a)(1).9         However, at a sidebar conference, the\n\ncourt addressed a related matter:               Tse's motion to exclude Tse's\n\nown convictions, one of which was for ABPO, if Tse should choose to\n\ntestify.       The    court    viewed     the   admissibility       of   Williams's\n\nconviction     as    closely    related    to    the   admissibility      of   Tse's\n\nconviction,     stating       that   \"[a]lthough       it's   not   an    identical\n\nanalysis, it's close enough that it may be that . . . if it's\n\nallowed in this case, it would be allowed in the other as well.\"\n\nThe court later reiterated:\n\n             And if a particular offense is admitted as\n             impeachment for the witness under [Rule 609]\n             (a)(1), then that may -- consistency may\n             result in a similar ruling with respect to the\n\n\n     9\n         Fed. R. Evid. 609 states in relevant part:\n\n             (a) General Rule.       For the purpose of\n             attacking the credibility of a witness,\n                  (1) evidence that a witness other than\n                  the accused has been convicted of a crime\n                  shall be admitted, subject to Rule 403,\n                  if the crime was punishable by death or\n                  imprisonment in excess of one year under\n                  the law under which the witness was\n                  convicted, and evidence that an accused\n                  has been convicted of such a crime shall\n                  be admitted if the court determines that\n                  the probative value of admitting this\n                  evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect\n                  to the accused; . . . .\n\nIn Massachusetts, ABPO is punishable by up to two and one half\nyears in prison.    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 13D.      Thus, it\nqualifies for admission under Rule 609 as a \"crime punishable by .\n. . imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which\nthe witness was convicted.\"\n\n                                        -20-\n\f            defendant, although I note there is a\n            distinction in (a)(1) between an accused and\n            someone who is not an accused. But since they\n            both -- I don't -- I know the language makes a\n            distinction.     I'm not sure it -- the\n            distinction -- pertains to the [Rule] 403\n            aspect of it.\n\nAfter hearing counsel's arguments about whether any of Tse's\n\nconvictions should be admitted if he were to testify, the court\n\nagain compared Williams's ABPO conviction to Tse's ABPO conviction,\n\nstating that \"if it's probative enough in one case, it has to be\n\nprobative enough in the other, it seems to me. . . .      There is a\n\ndifference [in standards of admissibility], but I'm not sure it's\n\na pertinent difference with respect to this.\"    The court added: \"I\n\ndon't know that there's, in fact, a different standard, except that\n\nmaybe it's a caution to make sure that it has probative value . .\n\n. .\"    Finally, the court determined that it would \"keep them both\n\nout,\" ruling that neither Williams's ABPO conviction nor Tse's ABPO\n\nconviction was admissible.    Tse objected and now argues on appeal\n\nthat the court improperly excluded Williams's ABPO conviction.10\n\n            Rule 609 provides different standards for admitting prior\n\nconvictions to impeach the accused and to impeach witnesses other\n\nthan the accused.    When the witness is the accused, evidence of a\n\nprior conviction \"shall be admitted if the court determines that\n\nthe probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its\n\n\n       10\n      Tse does not argue on appeal that the court's ruling deterred\nhim from testifying.    He argues only that he should have been\nallowed to impeach Williams with his prior ABPO conviction.\n\n                                 -21-\n\fprejudicial effect to the accused.\"               Fed. R. Evid. 609.         When the\n\nwitness    is   other    than    the      accused,   such   evidence     \"shall    be\n\nadmitted, subject to Rule 403.\"             Id.   Rule 403 in turn states that\n\n\"evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the\n\nissues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue\n\ndelay,    waste   of    time    or   needless     presentation     of    cumulative\n\nevidence.\"      Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n\n            This dual approach is the result of a 1990 amendment to\n\nRule 609.       Prior to that amendment, the rule did not explicitly\n\ndistinguish between the accused and witnesses other than the\n\naccused.     Rather, a district court could admit prior convictions\n\nagainst any witness if it determined that \"the probative value of\n\nadmitting this evidence outweigh[ed] its prejudicial effect to the\n\ndefendant.\"       See 4      Jack    B.    Weinstein   &    Margaret    A.    Berger,\n\nWeinstein's Federal Evidence, § 609App.03[1] (Joseph M. McLaughlin,\n\ned., Matthew Bender 2d ed. 2004) (stating the language of Rule 609\n\nprior to the 1990 amendment). The language of the rule, explicitly\n\nprotecting only against prejudice to the defendant in a criminal\n\ncase, seemingly provided no protection to litigants in civil cases\n\nor to prosecution witnesses in criminal cases.                  See Green v. Bock\n\nLaundry Mach. Co., 490 U.S. 504, 509, 527 (1989) (holding that the\n\npre-1990 version        of   Rule    609    required   courts    to     admit   prior\n\nconvictions against civil litigants regardless of prejudice, and\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\fnoting that \"impeaching evidence detrimental to the prosecution in\n\na criminal case 'shall be admitted' without any such balancing [of\n\nprobative value against prejudice]\").\n\n           The    1990   amendment         \"[did]    not   disturb       the     special\n\nbalancing test for the criminal defendant who chooses to testify.\"\n\nFed. R. Evid. 609 advisory committee's notes on 1990 amendment.\n\nRather, the amendment made prior convictions of witnesses other\n\nthan the accused explicitly subject to the Rule 403 analysis.                           See\n\nid.   (\"[T]he    ordinary      balancing     test     of   Rule    403     .    .   .   is\n\nappropriate for assessing the admissibility of prior convictions\n\nfor impeachment of any witness other than a criminal defendant.\").\n\n           This    change      may   not    have    been   aimed     explicitly         at\n\nproviding protection for witnesses other than the accused in a\n\ncriminal   trial.        See    H.   Richard        Uviller,      Essay:       Credence,\n\nCharacter, and the Rules of Evidence: Seeing Through the Liar's\n\nTale, 42 Duke L.J. 776, 798 (1993) (\"A solid argument might be made\n\nthat the entire purpose to the amendment to Rule 609(a) was to\n\nclarify its application to civil cases . . . .\").                    Nevertheless,\n\n\"whether intended or not, . . . the amendment of Rule 609(a) has\n\nhad a dramatic impact on the impeachment of prosecution witnesses\n\nin criminal cases.\"      Id. at 798.         \"[P]rosecution witnesses should\n\nbe shielded from impeachment by prior conviction if revealing the\n\nprior conviction would result in prejudice to the prosecution.\"\n\nId. at 801 (emphasis in original).            Indeed, the Advisory Committee\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fNotes indicate that the drafters were aware of the amendment's\n\nimpact on government witnesses:\n\n          Some courts have read Rule 609(a) as giving\n          the   government    no  protection   for   its\n          witnesses. This approach is . . . rejected by\n          the amendment.     There are cases in which\n          impeachment of government witnesses with prior\n          convictions that have little, if anything, to\n          do with credibility may result in unfair\n          prejudice to the government's interest in a\n          fair trial and unnecessary embarrassment to a\n          witness.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 609 advisory committee's notes on 1990 amendment\n\n(citations omitted).   Thus, there is no doubt that we must apply a\n\nRule 403 analysis to prior convictions of government witnesses in\n\na criminal prosecution.11\n\n          Although Rule 609 sets out two different evidentiary\n\nstandards for admitting prior convictions for impeachment, it does\n\nnot make clear whether the court's application of each standard\n\nrequires a substantively different analysis.     Some commentators\n\nhave suggested that Rule 609 provides greater protection to the\n\naccused than it does to other witnesses in the use of prior\n\nconvictions for impeachment.   See Weinstein, supra, § 609.02 (\"If\n\n\n\n     11\n      Separate from admitting prior convictions to impeach a\ngovernment witness under Rule 609, \"the Confrontation Clause of the\nSixth Amendment requires a defendant to have some opportunity to\nshow bias on the part of a prosecution witness.\" United States v.\nAbel, 469 U.S. 45, 50 (1984). \"In any case in which the trial\ncourt believes that confrontation rights require admission of\nimpeachment evidence, obviously the Constitution would take\nprecedence over [Rule 609].\"        Fed.

Evid. 609 advisory\ncommittee's notes on 1990 amendment.\n\n                               -24-\n\fthe witness to be impeached is the accused in a criminal case, the\n\nrule establishes a more stringent discretionary standard [for\n\nadmissibility].\").          Others      are   skeptical       that   the     difference\n\nbetween the two balancing tests is sufficiently different to draw\n\na practical distinction in the evidentiary showing required for\n\nadmission of a prior conviction.                    See Uviller, supra, at 800\n\n(suggesting       that    \"the     practical        possibility      of      such   fine\n\ncalibration of the danger of prejudice is dubious.\").                          Although\n\n\"the nature of the distinction is elusive,\" Uviller, supra, at 799,\n\nthe   drafting     of     the    rule   suggests      that    the    distinction      is\n\nintentional.        If    the    drafters     had    wanted    to    apply    the   same\n\nevidentiary test to all prior convictions, they could easily have\n\nstated a universal rule instead of differentiating between the\n\naccused and all other witnesses.              We therefore examine closely the\n\ntwo standards to determine the precise nature of their differences.\n\n            To     describe       accurately        the   distinctions        in    Rule\n\n609(a)(1), however, we must first unravel a linguistic oddity in\n\nits language.      With respect to a witness other than the accused,\n\nthe rule provides that a conviction \"shall be admitted, subject to\n\nRule 403.\"       The instruction that convictions \"shall be admitted\"\n\nindicates that Rule 609 is a rule of inclusion; any conviction\n\nmeeting Rule 609's requirements will be admitted.                         However, the\n\nreference    to    Rule    403    complicates       the   analysis.        That     rule,\n\napplicable when a party objects to otherwise relevant evidence,\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\fprovides that evidence \"may be excluded if its probative value is\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\"   Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 403.     Thus, by its language, Rule 403 is a rule of\n\nexclusion. These conflicting formulations of inclusion in rule 609\n\nand exclusion in Rule 403 raise some uncertainty about whether the\n\nimpeaching party (here Tse, who sought to impeach Williams with his\n\nprior conviction) bears the burden of demonstrating the superior\n\nprobative value of the prior convictions to justify admission of\n\nthe evidence, or whether the impeached party (here the government,\n\nwhich sought to avoid the impeachment of Williams with his prior\n\nconviction) bears the burden of demonstrating the danger of unfair\n\nprejudice to justify exclusion of the evidence.       See Uviller,\n\nsupra, at 799-800 (noting this distinction).\n\n          The advisory committee notes offer some clarification\n\nregarding the use of a prior conviction to impeach government\n\nwitnesses.12   The notes state that the \"[Rule 403] balancing test\n\nprotects . . . the government in criminal cases\" and that \"[o]nly\n\nwhen the government is able to point to a real danger of prejudice\n\nthat is sufficient to outweigh substantially the probative value of\n\n\n     12\n      Although Rule 609 distinguishes between \"an accused\" and any\n\"witness other than an accused\" (thereby including witnesses in\ncivil cases), the advisory committee notes also discuss\nspecifically a \"government witness\" in a criminal case.        The\ndistinction at issue in this case is between \"an accused\" and a\n\"government witness,\" and we therefore focus the remainder of our\ndiscussion on that distinction, drawing from the comments in the\nadvisory committee notes that are specific to the attempt to\nimpeach a government witness.\n\n                               -26-\n\fthe conviction for impeachment purposes will the conviction be\n\nexcluded.\"    Fed. R. Evid. 609 advisory committee's notes on 1990\n\namendment.    Therefore, although the proponent of the admission of\n\nthe evidence of a prior conviction is the accused who seeks to\n\nimpeach the government witness, the government bears the burden of\n\nprotecting its witnesses from such impeachment by demonstrating to\n\nthe court, pursuant to Rule 403's exclusionary rule, that the\n\nprobative    value   of   the   conviction   at   issue   is   substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, or the other grounds\n\nfor exclusion noted in Rule 403.13\n\n            This standard of prejudice differs from the standard of\n\nprejudice applicable to the court's consideration of requests by\n\nthe government to impeach a defendant with prior convictions.           The\n\ncourt may exclude a prior conviction of the accused, offered for\n\nthe purpose of impeachment, if the prejudicial effect of the\n\n\n     13\n      These other grounds for exclusion available to government\nwitnesses include \"confusion of the issues,\" \"misleading of the\njury,\" and \"considerations of undue delay, waste of time or\nneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" Fed. R. Evid. 403.\nRule 609 does not explicitly mention these grounds for excluding\nthe prior convictions of an accused. Instead, it refers only to\nthe \"prejudicial effect to the accused.\" \"From the imbalance, some\nmight claim that the impeaching convictions might be excluded when\noffered against a witness other than the accused by operation of\nthe distraction or delay factor, whereas a prior criminal\nconviction of the defendant will always be efficient.\" Uviller,\nsupra, at 800. \"[S]uch a construction of the distinction between\ndefendant-witnesses and other witnesses would be inconsistent with\nthe policy . . . that a higher standard should protect the\ntestifying defendant in a criminal case against impeachment by\nprior conviction.\" Id. at 801. Although the issue noted is an\nimportant one, this case does not require us to resolve it.\n\n                                    -27-\n\fconviction merely outweighs its probative value; the court may\n\nexclude a conviction of a government witness, offered by the\n\naccused for the purpose of impeachment, only if the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice from the conviction substantially outweighs its\n\nprobative value.\n\n          In addition, Rule 403 protects government witnesses only\n\nagainst the danger of \"unfair prejudice,\" while Rule 609 protects\n\nthe accused against any \"prejudicial effect.\" See United States v.\n\nSmith, 292 F.3d 90, 99 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting that Rule 403\n\nprotects only against unfair prejudice rather than all prejudice);\n\nUnited States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (\"[A]ll evidence is meant to be prejudicial; it is only\n\nunfair prejudice which must be avoided.\").        \"Usually, courts use\n\nthe term 'unfair prejudice' for evidence that invites the jury to\n\nrender a verdict on an improper emotional basis.\"         Varoudakis, 233\n\nF.3d at 122; see also United States v. Currier, 836 F.2d 11, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (noting that \"unfair prejudice\" is prejudice that\n\ncauses \"a jury to base its decision on something other than the\n\nestablished   proposition   in   the   case\"   (quoting    1   Weinstein's\n\nEvidence § 403[03], 36-39 (1986))). Thus, while a court must weigh\n\nall potential \"prejudicial effect\" to the defendant when deciding\n\nwhether to admit a prior conviction of the accused, it must weigh\n\nonly the kind of prejudice that can be deemed \"unfair\" when\n\n\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\fdeciding whether to admit the prior conviction of a government\n\nwitness.\n\n            These      distinctions--\"substantially         outweighs\"   versus\n\n\"outweighs,\" and \"unfair prejudice\" versus \"prejudicial effect\"--\n\nsupport the assertion of the Weinstein treatise that the standard\n\nfor the admission of prior convictions of the accused is stricter\n\nthan the standard for the admission of prior convictions of a\n\ngovernment witness.         These distinctions also recognize that the\n\npotential prejudice to the defendant from the admission of prior\n\nconvictions is simply not the same as the potential prejudice to a\n\ngovernment witness. In particular, there is a heightened risk that\n\na jury will use evidence of a prior conviction of the accused to\n\ndraw an impermissible propensity inference:\n\n            [I]n virtually every case in which prior\n            convictions are used to impeach the testifying\n            defendant, the defendant faces a unique risk\n            of    prejudice--i.e.,    the   danger    that\n            convictions that would be excluded under Fed.\n            R. Evid. 404 will be misused by a jury as\n            propensity evidence despite their introduction\n            solely for impeachment purposes.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 609 advisory committee's notes on 1990 amendment.\n\nSee also Uviller, supra, at 802-803 (\"[T]he outstanding difference\n\nbetween    harm   to    a   defendant   and    harm   to   other   witnesses   is\n\nundeniable: A jury might conclude from the testifying defendant's\n\ncriminal career (despite vociferous instructions from the court to\n\nthe contrary) that he committed the crime charged because of a\n\ndemonstrated propensity to engage in criminal conduct.

Moreover, revelations of past convictions may\n\ninflame the jury.     See, e.g., United States v. Beahm, 664 F.2d 414,\n\n419 (4th Cir. 1981) (excluding evidence of a prior conviction in\n\npart because \"it was likely to inflame the jury and thus prejudice\n\nthe defendant\").\n\n             In   contrast,   the   prior   convictions   of   a   government\n\nwitness are unlikely to inflame the jury or invite a propensity\n\ninference:\n\n            The probability that prior convictions of an\n            ordinary government witness will be unduly\n            prejudicial is low in most criminal cases.\n            Since the behavior of the witness is not the\n            issue in dispute in most cases, there is\n            little chance that the trier of fact will\n            misuse the convictions offered as impeachment\n            evidence as propensity evidence.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 609 advisory committee's notes on 1990 amendment.\n\nRather, the prior convictions of government witnesses are more\n\nlikely to cause \"unfair prejudice to the government's interest in\n\na fair trial and unnecessary embarrassment to [the] witness.\"              Id.\n\nWhile these are important concerns, see United States v. Orlando-\n\nFigueroa, 229 F.3d 33, 46 (1st Cir. 2000) (affirming district\n\ncourt's decision to exclude prior crime of government witness\n\ninvolving dishonesty where defense was able to impeach the witness\n\nwith evidence of more recent dishonest acts), \"trial courts will be\n\nskeptical    when   the   government   objects   to   impeachment     of   its\n\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fwitnesses with prior convictions.\"           Fed. R. Evid. 609 advisory\n\ncommittee's notes on 1990 amendment.\n\n            We   summarize.     With    respect    to   the   use   of     prior\n\nconvictions for impeachment, Rule 609 distinguishes between the\n\naccused and mere witnesses.      A court may admit a conviction of the\n\naccused only if the probative value \"outweighs its prejudicial\n\neffect to the accused.\"         By contrast, a court shall admit a\n\nconviction of a government witness unless that conviction should be\n\nexcluded under Rule 403.      The burden under Rule 403 is on the party\n\nopposing admission, who must show that the probative value \"is\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\"                 In\n\nthis case, in considering the admission of a prior conviction of\n\nTse and a prior conviction of Williams, the government's principal\n\nwitness, the district court appeared to apply a uniform standard of\n\nexclusion. If so, the failure to apply the different standards for\n\nexclusion was an error of law.14\n\n            However,   any    such   error   was   harmless.        \"[A]   non-\n\nconstitutional evidentiary error will be treated as harmless if it\n\nis highly probable that the error did not contribute to the\n\nverdict.\"    United States v. Rose, 104 F.3d 1408, 1414 (1st Cir.\n\n\n     14\n      Moreover, explicit rulings on these separate evidentiary\nissues are important to facilitate review on appeal. See United\nStates v. Oakes, 565 F.2d 170, 173 n.12 (1st Cir. 1977) (\"[T]he\ndistrict court's explicit statements in the record revealing its\nknowledge of Rule 609(a) and the basis for its resolution of the\nbalancing required by it are most helpful to this court in carrying\nout our review.\").\n\n                                     -31-\n\f1997).     The government bears the burden of persuasion to show that\n\nthe error is harmless.          Id.         \"In conducting a harmless error\n\nanalysis, the court 'must mull the ruling in context, giving due\n\nweight     to   the    totality      of    the     circumstances'\"        and   avoid\n\n\"'unnecessarily        interven[ing]        in     a      process   that--although\n\nimperfect--adequately         protected      defendant's        rights.'\"       United\n\nStates v. Wilkerson, 251 F.3d 273, 280 (1st Cir. 2001) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n              The excluded evidence of Williams's prior conviction was\n\nunmistakably cumulative.            Id.; see also Rose, 104 F.3d at 1414.\n\nThe jury heard evidence that Williams had been convicted of at\n\nleast one crime; that he had made false statements to the grand\n\njury and on a job application;15 that he had been paid a significant\n\nsum for his work as a DEA informant and had bought a new car soon\n\nafter the November transaction; that he had not reported his\n\nearnings from the DEA on his tax return, despite having been told\n\nto do so; and finally, that he had dealt and used illicit drugs in\n\nthe   past.      The   jury   had    ample       reason    to   closely   scrutinize\n\nWilliams's credibility in this case.                It is highly probable that\n\nany error in excluding Williams's ABPO conviction had no impact on\n\nthe verdict.\n\n\n\n      15\n      On cross-examination, Williams admitted stating on an\nemployment application that he had attended Bunker Hill Community\nCollege even though he had never enrolled there as a full-time\nstudent.\n\n                                          -32-\n\fB. Traffic Stop\n\n                As a general matter, a defendant has the right to cross-\n\nexamine a prosecution witness about matters that might cause the\n\nwitness to be biased against the defendant.                      See, e.g., United\n\nStates     v.    Barrett,   766    F.2d    609,    614   (1st    Cir.   1985)   (\"[A]\n\ndefendant has a right to cross-examine an accomplice as to the\n\nnature     of    any   agreement    he     had    with   the    government   or   any\n\nexpectation or hope that he may have that he will be treated\n\nleniently in exchange for his cooperation.\"). However, a defendant\n\nmust lay a proper foundation before evidence of bias is admitted.\n\nBui v. DiPaolo, 170 F.3d 232, 245 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"[A] defendant\n\n. . . must present a satisfactory foundation for the critical\n\nelements on which his hypothesis of bias depends.\").\n\n                Moreover, once the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to\n\nestablish bias has been satisfied, the district court has the\n\ndiscretion to limit the scope of the bias inquiry.                      See Bui, 170\n\nF.3d at 242 (\"[T]o the extent that the petitioner is suggesting\n\nthat   a    criminal     defendant        has    license   to    cross-question    a\n\nprosecution witness concerning every conceivable theory of bias, .\n\n. . he is plainly wrong.\"); Barrett, 766 F.2d at 614 (\"[T]he court\n\nhas the discretion to limit cross-examination once the defendant's\n\nSixth Amendment right to establish the potential bias of the\n\naccomplice-witness has been satisfied.\").                  The district court's\n\ndiscretion allows it to exclude evidence of previously dismissed\n\n\n                                          -33-\n\fcriminal charges against the witness.                  United States v. Marrero-\n\nOrtiz, 160 F.3d 768, 775 (1st Cir. 1998) (finding no abuse of\n\ndiscretion where the district court prohibited the defendant from\n\ncross-examining a prosecution witness about a dismissed charge of\n\nweapons possession).\n\n                Tse laid no foundation for his line of questioning about\n\nthe traffic stop.             The record does not indicate that charges\n\nagainst Williams were dropped in return for Williams's cooperation\n\nwith the DEA, and Tse never attempted to offer evidence to this\n\neffect.     Indeed, if such an agreement did exist, the government\n\nwould have been obligated to disclose it along with its disclosures\n\nabout Williams's compensation for his role in the DEA stings.                   See\n\nGiglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154-55 (1972) (holding that\n\nfailure to disclose impeachment material against a government\n\nwitness is a violation of due process).                 Tse's questioning relied\n\nsolely     on    a   theory   of   quid   pro    quo   entirely   unsupported   by\n\nevidence.\n\n                Moreover, Tse's right to question Williams about his\n\npotential bias in favor of the government was satisfied by other\n\nlines of questioning.          Tse established that Williams began working\n\nat   the    Boston       Housing   Authority--the       same   organization   that\n\nemployed one of the DEA task force members in the Tse sting\n\noperation--after he had testified as a cooperating witness in a\n\nprevious        trial.        He   established     that     Williams   had    been\n\n\n                                          -34-\n\fintermittently unemployed prior to working for the DEA, and that\n\nthe DEA had, on certain occasions, helped him pay routine bills and\n\nexpenses. He further established that Williams had purchased a new\n\ncar in the fall of 1999, and that he had signed a loan application\n\nlisting the DEA as his employer and a monthly income of $2,700.\n\nWilliams's direct examination testimony established that the DEA\n\nhad paid him $17,000 for his work as an informant.           In light of\n\nthis other evidence of bias, the district court acted well within\n\nits discretion in excluding evidence of the traffic stop.\n\nC. Employment Application\n\n          Tse     attempted   to    attack   Williams's   character      for\n\ntruthfulness by asking Williams about allegedly false statements\n\nthat Williams had made on an employment application in 1997.\n\nAlthough the court initially ruled that Tse could not question\n\nWilliams about the application, it agreed to revisit the issue on\n\nthe next day of trial.     When Tse renewed his request the following\n\nday, he said he would use the employment application to refresh\n\nWilliams's memory if Williams could not recall the statements he\n\nhad made on the application.       The government argued that Tse could\n\nquestion Williams about the application but could not use the\n\napplication to refresh Williams's memory because doing so would be\n\ntantamount   to   using   extrinsic   evidence   to   impeach,   which    is\n\n\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\fexpressly prohibited by Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b).16                       The\n\ncourt        agreed   with    the     government,     noting   that   the    alleged\n\nmisrepresentations at issue in this case were collateral because\n\nthey did not relate directly to any matter at issue in the case.\n\nThe court allowed Tse to question Williams about the employment\n\napplication but prohibited Tse from using the application itself to\n\nrefresh Williams's memory. Tse's counsel asked Williams about only\n\ntwo statements on the employment application: the dates of his\n\nemployment at the Gillette company, and the statement that he had\n\nbeen a student at Bunker Hill Community College.17\n\n                District     courts    have   broad    discretion     to    determine\n\nwhether to permit the refreshing of a witness's memory. See 28\n\nWright & Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence §                       6184\n\n(1993).         In this case, the district court was not obligated to\n\nallow Tse to refresh Williams's memory on the collateral issue of\n\nthe content of the employment application.18               Tse's questions about\n\n\n        16\n             Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) states in relevant part:\n\n\"Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of\nattacking or supporting the witness' character for truthfulness,\nother than conviction of crime as provided in Rule 609, may not be\nproved by extrinsic evidence.\"\n        17\n      These lines of questioning garnered mixed results. Tse did\nnot establish whether Williams had made false statements about his\ndates of employment at Gillette.     As stated supra at note 15,\nhowever, Williams did admit that he had not been a full time\nstudent at Bunker Hill Community College.\n     18\n      \"A matter is considered collateral if 'the matter itself is\nnot relevant in the litigation to establish a fact of consequence,\n\n                                          -36-\n\fthe employment application had no conceivable relevance other than\n\nto   impeach     Williams     as   untruthful.        Using    the   employment\n\napplication for this purpose would be a clear violation of Rule\n\n608(b).   The court acted well within its discretion in refusing to\n\nallow   Tse    to   refresh    Williams's    memory    on     matters   entirely\n\ncollateral to the case.        See United States v. Marino, 277 F.3d 11,\n\n24 (1st Cir. 2002) (excluding testimony contradicting the witness's\n\ncharacterization of his activities as a drug dealer as extrinsic\n\nevidence on a collateral matter in violation of Rule 608(b), even\n\nthough the truthfulness of the witness's testimony was critical to\n\nthe prosecution's case).\n\n                                       V.\n\n              During   redirect    examination    the       prosecution    asked\n\nWilliams if the DEA had offered him relocation money as part of his\n\ncompensation for acting as a cooperating witness.                Tse objected.\n\nThe court initially sustained the objection, but the prosecution\n\nasked to be heard on the matter.             At sidebar, the prosecution\n\nexplained that, as part of his agreement with the DEA, if Williams\n\nlied on the stand during his testimony, the DEA would not provide\n\nhim with any relocation funds. Without those funds, Williams would\n\nbe stuck in Massachusetts even if he feared retaliation from some\n\n\n\ni.e. not relevant for a purpose other than mere contradiction of\nthe in court testimony of the witness.'\"       United States v.\nBeauchamp, 986 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting 1 McCormack on\nEvidence § 45, at 169 (4th ed. 1992)).\n\n                                      -37-\n\fof the drug traffickers that he had helped the DEA arrest.             Thus,\n\nWilliams had an incentive to testify truthfully. The court changed\n\nits earlier ruling and allowed the prosecution to proceed.                  The\n\nsubsequent exchange was as follows:\n\n          Q.   Mr.    Williams,   has   the   DEA   offered   you   money    to\n\n          relocate you?\n\n          A. Yes.\n\n          Q. Why?\n\n          A. Because they didn't think I should be staying in the\n\n          same place, and sometimes I hear a lot of things that's\n\n          coming from jail --\n\n                     DEFENSE COUNSEL:     Objection.\n\n          A. -- from these guys --\n\n                     DEFENSE COUNSEL:     Objection, Your Honor.\n\n                     THE COURT:   No.   Go ahead.      Go ahead.\n\n          A. -- and little side talks about these guys telling\n\n          people they're getting me and all of this stuff.\n\n          Q. [Defense counsel] asked you a series of questions this\n\n          morning that you did some DEA control buys from people\n\n          you knew?\n\n          A. Yes.\n\n          Q. And you still live in the Boston area?\n\n          A. Yes, I do.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -38-\n\f          Q. Let me ask you Mr. Williams, do you know what happens\n\n          if   you    lie    to   the   DEA    agents   during   an   undercover\n\n          operation?        What happens to your status as an informant?\n\n          A. I don't know what they do about it, but lying as\n\n          telling them lies?\n\n          Q. Yes.     Do they continue to use you?\n\n                     DEFENSE COUNSEL: Objection, Your Honor.\n\n                     THE COURT: Overruled.\n\n          Q. Would the DEA continue to use you if they find out\n\n          that you're lying to them?\n\n          A. No, they wouldn't.\n\n          Q. Would they continue to pay you money?\n\n          A. No, they wouldn't.\n\n          Q. Would they continue to offer you relocation benefits?\n\n          A. Not that I know about that.\n\n          Tse argues that Williams's references to \"a lot of things\n\nthat's coming from jail\" and \"these guys telling people they're\n\ngetting me and all of this stuff\" were prejudicial because they\n\ninsinuated that Tse was or had been in prison and that Tse was the\n\nsource of threats against Williams's life.19             This argument is not\n\n\n     19\n      Tse also argued before the district court and on appeal that\nhe had not been notified of Williams's relocation agreement and\nthat the disclosure during trial was thus a late disclosure in\nviolation of Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154-55 (1972)\n(holding that non-disclosure of impeachment evidence may require a\nnew trial where the witness's testimony may have determined guilt\nor innocence). The record demonstrates that the prosecution sent\n\n                                        -39-\n\fconvincing. Williams's redirect testimony did not suggest that Tse\n\nwas in prison or that Tse had been the source of death threats\n\nagainst Williams.    During his earlier testimony, Williams made\n\nclear that he had participated in several other operations with the\n\nDEA, buying drugs both from people that he already knew and from\n\npeople whom he met only when he attempted to purchase drugs from\n\nthem at the DEA's direction.   Neither Williams nor the prosecution\n\nsuggested that Tse was the source of the threats against Williams's\n\nlife.   Thus, we find no error in the court's decision to allow\n\nTse's redirect testimony.\n\n                                VI.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\nTse's counsel a letter dated May 30, 2000, stating that \"[Williams]\nhas also been promised some form of relocation assistance in the\nevent it becomes necessary due to threats to his person.\" Thus,\nTse's Giglio claim fails.\n\n                                -40-\n\f",

In evaluating one of his claims on appeal relating to a limitation on the cross-examination of the government's principal witness, we must address the important differences in analysis between admitting a prior conviction to impeach a defendant's testimony and admitting such a conviction to impeach the testimony of a government witness. We must also address Tse's challenges to the admission of evidence of a subsequent drug transaction, the adequacy of the district court's limiting instructions about that transaction, two additional limitations on his ability to impeach the testimony of the principal government witness, and the admission of allegedly prejudicial testimony by that witness. After full consideration of these issues, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 24, 1998, agents of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) attempted to record a drug transaction between Tse and a cooperating witness, Stephen Williams. The DEA agents outfitted Williams with an audio transmitter called a \"kel.\" The device allowed the agents to listen to and record Williams's conversations, but did not allow them to communicate with Williams. After searching Williams and his car to ensure that he did not have any drugs or cash, the agents gave him $450 and instructed him to purchase crack cocaine from Tse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 6:30 P.M., Williams drove to Tse's residence in Mattapan, Massachusetts. The DEA recorded the ensuing conversation in which Williams told Tse that he had only $450 and that he wanted to buy a half ounce of crack cocaine for that amount. Tse told Williams to return in ten minutes. Williams left Tse's residence and again met with the DEA agents. They instructed him to return to Tse's house to make the drug purchase. At approximately 7:10 P.M. Williams returned to Tse's house where Tse was on the phone, apparently receiving directions to a nearby location. After the phone call, Tse told Williams \"we're on,\" and said that they needed to travel \"just around the corner.\" Tse and Williams left the house and entered Williams's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Williams and Tse drove off, the DEA agents lost the signal from Williams's kel transmitter. Despite their attempts to follow Williams, the agents were not able to record any other conversations between Williams and Tse that evening. However, shortly after Williams and Tse drove off, a member of the DEA surveillance team saw Williams's car parked on a nearby street, only a few blocks from Tse's residence. At least one person was sitting in the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Williams testified that he and Tse drove to a house only a few minutes away. Williams remained in the car while Tse spoke with a man in the doorway and entered the building. According to Williams, Tse returned several minutes later and gave a bag of crack cocaine to Williams. Williams and Tse then drove back to Tse's house, where Tse gave Williams a scrap of paper with Tse's pager number written on it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Williams dropped Tse off at his residence, he met with the DEA agents and handed over the drugs and the scrap of paper on which Tse had written his pager number. DEA laboratory tests confirmed that the drugs that Tse had allegedly supplied to Williams included 11.2 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 2, 1999, Williams again participated in a DEA operation targeting Tse. He used the pager number that Tse had given him after the previous transaction to contact Tse. In a recorded call, Williams and Tse spoke in a mutually understood code about a drug transaction. Tse agreed to sell 62 grams of cocaine to Williams for $1,800. Williams was again outfitted with a kel transmitter, and DEA agents followed Williams to the meeting place with Tse. When Tse arrived, he provided Williams with powder cocaine. This time, the DEA agents were able to record the entire transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 27, 2000, a grand jury charged Tse with two counts of distributing a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). Count one alleged that Tse had distributed crack cocaine during the November 24 transaction; count two alleged that Tse had distributed powder cocaine during the February 2 transaction. On December 12, 2000, Tse pled guilty to count two and proceeded to a jury trial on count one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the DEA agents had been unable to record the November 24 transaction, the government relied heavily on Williams's testimony to describe the events of that evening. Williams was not an ideal witness, and Tse's primary strategy was to discredit Williams's testimony. Through both direct and cross-examination, the jury heard, <i>inter alia,</i> that Williams had used and sold drugs in the past, had been convicted of at least one crime, had made inaccurate statements to the grand jury about his prior involvement with drugs,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> had received substantial compensation for his work as a DEA informant, and had purchased a new car shortly after receiving payments from the DEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial lasted four days, ending on December 15, 2000. Despite Tse's aggressive impeachment of Williams's testimony, the jury found Tse guilty of distributing a controlled substance during the November 24 transaction. On April 25, 2001, the district court sentenced Tse to 120 months in prison on each count (as noted, he had pled guilty to count two of the indictment) to be served concurrently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Tse claims that the district court made a number of errors. First, Tse argues that the district court erred in admitting evidence of the February transaction. Second, Tse argues that the court gave inadequate limiting instructions to the jury about the proper use of evidence of the February transaction. Third, he argues that the district court erred in limiting his cross-examination of Williams by preventing him from (1) impeaching Williams's credibility by introducing evidence that Williams had been convicted of assault and battery against a police officer, (2) introducing evidence that charges against Williams stemming from a traffic stop were dismissed after Williams began cooperating with the DEA, and (3) refreshing Williams's memory with an employment application he had filled out several years earlier. Finally, Tse argues that the district court impermissibly allowed the government to solicit prejudicial evidence from Williams during redirect examination. We address each of Tse's arguments in turn, relating the relevant details of the trial where appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government sought to introduce evidence of the February transaction, arguing that such evidence had \"special relevance\" under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The government offered several theories of admissibility. First, it argued that the February transaction demonstrated Tse's intent in meeting with Williams on November 24. Because Tse had argued in his opening statement that his November meeting with Williams did not involve a drug transaction, the government reasoned that evidence of Tse's intent was at issue in the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Second, the government argued that the February evidence was admissible to boost Williams's credibility since the February transaction was similar to Williams's description of the November transaction. Third, the government argued that tape of the February transaction showed that Tse had sold drugs to Williams on previous occasions because, when Williams called to arrange the February deal, both he and Tse began speaking about the transaction in a mutually understood code without an initial discussion of whether Tse could procure drugs. Finally, the government argued that the February transaction demonstrated a \"criminal association\" between Tse and Williams, creating an inference that, if their purpose for meeting on February 2 was to carry out a drug transaction, their purpose for meeting on November 24 was likely to carry out a similar transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tse objected that evidence of the February transaction had no special relevance because he had admitted that he and Williams were together on November 24 during the time of the alleged drug transaction. He argued that there was therefore no need to admit evidence to demonstrate the relationship between Williams and Tse. Rather, evidence of the February transaction could only be used by the jury to draw a forbidden propensity inference: if Tse had sold drugs to Williams on February 2, he likely sold drugs to Williams on November 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing arguments on this issue, the district court admitted the evidence, ruling that the evidence had \"special relevance\" within the scope of Rule 404(b) because it demonstrated that Tse and Williams had a \"criminal association\" in February.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The court did not specify the probative value of this \"criminal association,\" stating only that the criminal association was \"one that the government may have evidence of.\" The court also ruled that the probative value of the February transaction was not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Thus, the court ruled that evidence of the February transaction was not barred by Rule 403.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The defense objected to these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court's determination that prior bad act evidence was admissible pursuant to Rules 404(b) and 403. <i>See United States v. Varoudakis,</i> 233 F.3d 113, 118 (1st Cir.2000). A district court may admit evidence of a defendant's other bad acts only if that evidence meets the requirements of both Rule 404(b) and Rule 403. To be admissible under Rule 404(b), \"the evidence must have `special relevance' to an issue in the case such as intent or knowledge, and must not include `bad character or propensity as a necessary link in the inferential chain.'\" <i>Varoudakis,</i> 233 F.3d at 118 (quoting <i>United States v. Frankhauser,</i> 80 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir. 1996)); <i>see also United States v. Escobar-de Jesus,</i> 187 F.3d 148, 169 (1st Cir.1999) (permitting the introduction of bad act evidence \"if the evidence is relevant for purposes other than proof of a defendant's bad character or criminal propensity\"). Second, pursuant to Rule 403, the probative value of the bad act evidence must not be \"substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\" Fed.R.Evid. 403; <i>see also Varoudakis,</i> 233 F.3d at 118. A trial court may admit evidence of other bad acts indicating a criminal association even when the evidence describes an event that occurred later than the charged crime. <i>United States v. Procopio,</i> 88 F.3d 21, 29 (1st Cir.1996) (\"A later criminal association increases the likelihood of an earlier one &#8212; which is all that `relevance' requires ... and numerous cases permit such reasoning from a later event or condition to an earlier one.\") (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a conspiracy case, the district court may admit evidence of other bad acts if they tend to suggest a criminal association between the alleged conspirators. <i>See Procopio,</i> 88 F.3d at 29. Evidence of a criminal association among the alleged conspirators can be probative in several respects. It can demonstrate the background of a relationship, a collaboration among several parties, or a mutual trust between conspirators. <i>See Varoudakis,</i> 233 F.3d at 121 (admitting evidence of a prior bad act to demonstrate mutual trust between alleged conspirators); <i>Escobar-de Jesus,</i> 187 F.3d at 169 (\"[E]vidence of other bad acts ... can be admitted to explain the background, formation and development of the illegal relationship ... and, more specifically, to help the jury understand the basis for the co-conspirators' relationship of mutual trust . . . .\") (citations omitted); <i>Procopio,</i> 88 F.3d at 29 (stating that evidence of a subsequent criminal association \"was helpful to the government's claim that the two men had collaborated\" in a prior robbery). It can also rebut a defendant's claim that his association with the alleged conspirators was innocent. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 215 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir.2000) (\"In particular, the government's evidence must overcome the possibility that a particular defendant's association with criminal co-conspirators was wholly innocent or that, if he was with them at the scene of criminal activity, he was `merely present,' without guilty knowledge or intent.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tse argues that, because he was not charged with conspiracy, his collaboration with other parties is not at issue. We disagree. Tse's defense &#8212; that he was with Williams on November 24 but that he did not participate in a drug transaction on that day &#8212; makes Tse's relationship with Williams \"directly in issue and material to the case\" and thus permits the court to admit evidence of a subsequent criminal association. <i>Escobar-de Jesus,</i> 187 F.3d at 169. <i>See also Rodriguez,</i> 215 F.3d at 119 (holding admissible evidence of another of defendant's drug ventures with the same participants to rebut defendant's claim that, on the occasion of the charged crime, he was an innocent bystander); <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 340 F.3d 169, 174 (3d Cir.2003) (following decisions \"upholding the admission of evidence of prior drug involvement for the purpose of rebutting defense claims of innocent association\"); <i>United States v. Ruiz-Estrada,</i> 312 F.3d 398, 403 (8th Cir.2002) (admitting other act evidence to rebut defendant's defense that he was \"merely present\" in an apartment that contained evidence of a drug conspiracy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the court properly admitted evidence of the February transaction to refute Tse's claim that his meeting with Williams in November was innocent. Evidence of the February transaction between Williams and Tse, including their use of coded language, indicated that they had collaborated on similar transactions in the past and that they both understood the nature of their meeting. Although the government did not have to demonstrate an agreement, as it would have in a conspiracy case, this evidence was still critical to demonstrate the nature of Tse's association with Williams, which helped to refute Tse's claim that their November meeting was innocent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of other bad acts always carries with it a danger of a forbidden propensity inference. But Rule 404(b) requires only that there be some other permissible reason, subject to the requirements of Rule 403, to admit the evidence. Here, evidence of the February transaction refuted Tse's claim that his association with Williams was innocent. Thus, the district court properly admitted the evidence under Rule 404(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After ruling on the admissibility of the February evidence, the district court gave the following limiting instruction to the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant is charged in this indictment with an offense said to have occurred on November 24, 1998. The government is offering evidence of another transaction in February of 1999 [that] the defendant is not charged with in this case. The evidence is offered as it may bear on your assessment of whether the government's case regarding the November incident is sufficient or not, including whether the government has established that the defendant knowingly and intentionally participated in a drug transaction on November 24, as alleged in the indictment. The evidence of the other incident may or may not, in your judgment, support a conclusion that he was a participant in such a transaction in November. The February '99 incident, if it occurred, if you find that it occurred, which is the first question, and if you do, you may consider it for that purpose if it bears on the defendant's knowing and intentional participation in a similar transaction in November. You may not consider it as evidence if it were that of the defendant's character or general propensity to be involved in criminal activity. This is not evidence about the defendant or his instincts or propensity. It is evidence that may or may not, as you judge appropriate, be used in considering what inferences you might make about the evidence concerning the November transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this instruction, the government solicited testimony from one of the DEA agents who monitored the February transaction, and played an audio tape of that transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tse objected that the court's limiting instruction did not state that the jury \"can only use [evidence of the February transaction] for the very specific purpose that the government has suggested here, which is that there is some kind of relationship between [Williams and Tse].\" The court responded that \"I don't want to be arguing the government's case, so I don't want to suggest there's a connection.\" The court then noted Tse's objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Tse challenges the adequacy of the district court's limiting instructions to the jury. Upon request by the defendant, a district court must instruct the jury on the permissible use of other bad act evidence admitted against the defendant. Fed.R.Evid. 105; <i>Huddleston v. United States,</i> 485 U.S. 681, 691-92, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988) (\"[T]he trial court shall, upon request, instruct the jury that the similar acts evidence is to be considered only for the proper purpose for which it was admitted.\"). The First Circuit pattern jury instructions explicitly state (1) that the bad act evidence cannot be used to infer guilt based on the defendant's character and (2) that the other act evidence may be used only for specific enumerated purposes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See</i> Pattern Crim. Jury Instr. 1st Cir. &#167; 2.05 (1998). However, \"[b]y their terms, those instructions are precatory, not mandatory. A district court possesses wide discretion to instruct in language that it deems most likely to ensure effective communication with jurors.\" <i>United States v. Gomez,</i> 255 F.3d 31, 39 n. 7 (1st Cir.2001). <i>See also</i> Pattern Crim. Jury Instr. 1st Cir., Preface (1998) (\"Although we believe that the pattern instructions ... will be helpful in crafting a jury charge in a particular case, it bears emphasis that no district judge is required to use the pattern instructions, and that the Court of Appeals has not in any way approved the use of a particular instruction.\"); <i>United States v. Palmer,</i> 203 F.3d 55, 59 (1st Cir.2000) (\"The district court has considerable leeway as to the phrasing and timing of a curative instruction.\"). Because Tse objected below to the formulation of the instruction, \"our review is for abuse of discretion `to determine whether the instructions adequately explained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.'\" <i>United States v.

First, the court specifically instructed that \"[y]ou may not consider it as evidence if it were that of the defendant's character or general propensity to be involved in criminal activity. This is not evidence about the defendant or his instincts or propensity.\" Second, the court identified the proper use for evidence of the February transaction: \"The evidence of the other incident may or may not, in your judgment, support a conclusion that [Tse] was a participant in such a transaction in November.... [Y]ou may consider [the February evidence] for that purpose if it bears on the defendant's knowing and intentional participation in a similar transaction in November.\" Thus, the court instructed the jury that it could not use evidence of the February transaction to make a propensity inference and that it should use the evidence only to determine Tse's knowledge and intent at the time of the alleged November transaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> We find no abuse of discretion in the court's instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the trial, prior to jury deliberations, the court again offered a limiting instruction regarding evidence of the February transaction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You may not consider evidence of the February 1999 transaction as indicating that the defendant is of bad character and therefore someone who had an inclination or propensity to commit the crime that's charged.

Unlike the earlier instruction just before the evidence was admitted, this instruction did not tell the jury the limited purpose for which it should use that evidence. While it would have been preferable for the trial judge to use the more complete instruction again, the plain error standard cannot be met. The jury had previously been given a full instruction on the proper use of the February evidence.

First, the court did not allow Tse to impeach Williams with Williams's previous conviction for assault and battery against a police officer. Second, the court did not permit Tse to offer evidence of charges against Williams, later dismissed, stemming from a traffic stop on September 6, 1998. Tse sought to use these charges to demonstrate that Williams had a motive to cooperate with the government. Finally, the court did not allow Tse to attack Williams's credibility by demonstrating that Williams had made false statements on an employment application.

At first, the district court agreed that the evidence was admissible pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> However, at a sidebar conference, the court addressed a related matter: Tse's motion to exclude Tse's own convictions, one of which was for ABPO, if Tse should choose to testify. The court viewed the admissibility of Williams's conviction as closely related to the admissibility of Tse's conviction, stating that \"[a]lthough it's not an identical analysis, it's close enough that it may be that ... if it's allowed in this case, it would be allowed in the other as well.\" The court later reiterated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And if a particular offense is admitted as impeachment for the witness under [Rule 609](a)(1), then that may &#8212; consistency may result in a similar ruling with respect to the defendant, although I note there is a distinction in (a)(1) between an accused and someone who is not an accused. But since they both &#8212; I don't &#8212; I know the language makes a distinction.

There is a difference [in standards of admissibility], but I'm not sure it's a pertinent difference with respect to this.\" The court added: \"I don't know that there's, in fact, a different standard, except that maybe it's a caution to make sure that it has probative value. . . .\" Finally, the court determined that it would \"keep them both out,\" ruling that neither Williams's ABPO conviction nor Tse's ABPO conviction was admissible. Tse objected and now argues on appeal that the court improperly excluded Williams's ABPO conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 609 provides different standards for admitting prior convictions to impeach the accused and to impeach witnesses other than the accused. When the witness is the accused, evidence of a prior conviction \"shall be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused.\" Fed.R.Evid. 609. When the witness is other than the accused, such evidence \"shall be admitted, subject to Rule 403.\" <i>Id.</i> Rule 403 in turn states that \"evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This dual approach is the result of a 1990 amendment to Rule 609. Prior to that amendment, the rule did not explicitly distinguish between the accused and witnesses other than the accused. Rather, a district court could admit prior convictions against any witness if it determined that \"the probative value of admitting this evidence outweigh[ed] its prejudicial effect to the defendant.\" <i>See</i> 4 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence,</i> &#167; 609App.03[1] (Joseph M. McLaughlin, ed., Matthew Bender 2d ed.2004) (stating the language of Rule 609 prior to the 1990 amendment). The language of the rule, explicitly protecting only against prejudice to the defendant in a criminal case, seemingly provided no protection to litigants in civil cases or to prosecution witnesses in criminal cases. <i>See Green v. Bock Laundry Mach. Co.,</i> 490 U.S. 504, 509, 527, 109 S.Ct. 1981, 104 L.Ed.2d 557 (1989) (holding that the pre-1990 version of Rule 609 required courts to admit prior convictions against civil litigants regardless of prejudice, and noting that \"impeaching evidence detrimental to the prosecution in a criminal case `shall be admitted' without any such balancing [of probative value against prejudice]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1990 amendment \"[did] not disturb the special balancing test for the criminal defendant who chooses to testify.\" Fed. R.Evid. 609 advisory committee's notes on 1990 amendment. Rather, the amendment made prior convictions of witnesses other than the accused explicitly subject to the Rule 403 analysis. <i>See id.</i> (\"[T]he ordinary balancing test of Rule 403 . . . is appropriate for assessing the admissibility of prior convictions for impeachment of any witness other than a criminal defendant.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This change may not have been aimed explicitly at providing protection for witnesses other than the accused in a criminal trial. <i>See</i> H. Richard Uviller, <i>Essay: Credence, Character, and the Rules of Evidence: Seeing Through the Liar's Tale,</i> 42 Duke L.J. 776, 798 (1993) (\"A solid argument might be made that the entire purpose to the amendment to Rule 609(a) was to clarify its application to civil cases....\"). Nevertheless, \"whether intended or not, ... the amendment of Rule 609(a) has had a dramatic impact on the impeachment of prosecution witnesses in criminal cases.\" <i>Id.</i> at 798. \"[P]rosecution witnesses should be shielded from impeachment by prior conviction if revealing the prior conviction would result in prejudice <i>to the prosecution.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 801 (emphasis in original). Indeed, the Advisory Committee Notes indicate that the drafters were aware of the amendment's impact on government witnesses:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some courts have read Rule 609(a) as giving the government no protection for its witnesses. This approach is ... rejected by the amendment. There are cases in which impeachment of government witnesses with prior convictions that have little, if anything, to do with credibility may result in unfair prejudice to the government's interest in a fair trial and unnecessary embarrassment to a witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 609 advisory committee's notes on 1990 amendment (citations omitted). Thus, there is no doubt that we must apply a Rule 403 analysis to prior convictions of government witnesses in a criminal prosecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rule 609 sets out two different evidentiary standards for admitting prior convictions for impeachment, it does not make clear whether the court's application of each standard requires a substantively different analysis. Some commentators have suggested that Rule 609 provides greater protection to the accused than it does to other witnesses in the use of prior convictions for impeachment. <i>See</i> Weinstein, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 609.02 (\"If the witness to be impeached is the accused in a criminal case, the rule establishes a more stringent discretionary standard [for admissibility].\"). Others are skeptical that the difference between the two balancing tests is sufficiently different to draw a practical distinction in the evidentiary showing required for admission of a prior conviction. <i>See</i> Uviller, <i>supra,</i> at 800 (suggesting that \"the practical possibility of such fine calibration of the danger of prejudice is dubious.\"). Although \"the nature of the distinction is elusive,\" Uviller, <i>supra,</i> at 799, the drafting of the rule suggests that the distinction is intentional. If the drafters had wanted to apply the same evidentiary test to all prior convictions, they could easily have stated a universal rule instead of differentiating between the accused and all other witnesses. We therefore examine closely the two standards to determine the precise nature of their differences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To describe accurately the distinctions in Rule 609(a)(1), however, we must first unravel a linguistic oddity in its language. With respect to a witness other than the accused, the rule provides that a conviction \"shall be admitted, subject to Rule 403.\" The instruction that convictions \"shall be admitted\" indicates that Rule 609 is a rule of inclusion; any conviction meeting Rule 609's requirements will be admitted. However, the reference to Rule 403 complicates the analysis. That rule, applicable when a party objects to otherwise relevant evidence, provides that evidence \"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\" Fed.R.Evid. 403. Thus, by its language, Rule 403 is a rule of exclusion. These conflicting formulations of inclusion in rule 609 and exclusion in Rule 403 raise some uncertainty about whether the impeaching party (here Tse, who sought to impeach Williams with his prior conviction) bears the burden of demonstrating the superior probative value of the prior convictions to justify admission of the evidence, or whether the impeached party (here the government, which sought to avoid the impeachment of Williams with his prior conviction) bears the burden of demonstrating the danger of unfair prejudice to justify exclusion of the evidence. <i>See</i> Uviller, <i>supra,</i> at 799-800 (noting this distinction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The advisory committee notes offer some clarification regarding the use of a prior conviction to impeach government witnesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The notes state that the \"[Rule 403] balancing test protects ... the government in criminal cases\" and that \"[o]nly when the government is able to point to a real danger of prejudice that is sufficient to outweigh substantially the probative value of the conviction for impeachment purposes will the conviction be excluded.\" Fed.R.Evid. 609 advisory committee's notes on 1990 amendment. Therefore, although the proponent of the admission of the evidence of a prior conviction is the accused who seeks to impeach the government witness, the government bears the burden of protecting its witnesses from such impeachment by demonstrating to the court, pursuant to Rule 403's exclusionary rule, that the probative value of the conviction at issue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, or the other grounds for exclusion noted in Rule 403.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This standard of prejudice differs from the standard of prejudice applicable to the court's consideration of requests by the government to impeach a defendant with prior convictions. The court may exclude a prior conviction of the accused, offered for the purpose of impeachment, if the prejudicial effect of the conviction merely <i>outweighs</i> its probative value; the court may exclude a conviction of a government witness, offered by the accused for the purpose of impeachment, only if the danger of unfair prejudice from the conviction <i>substantially outweighs</i> its probative value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Rule 403 protects government witnesses only against the danger of \"unfair prejudice,\" while Rule 609 protects the accused against any \"prejudicial effect.\" <i>See United States v. Smith,</i> 292 F.3d 90, 99 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that Rule 403 protects only against unfair prejudice rather than all prejudice); <i>United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada,</i> 877 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir.1989) (\"[A]ll evidence is meant to be prejudicial; it is only <i>unfair</i> prejudice which must be avoided.\"). \"Usually, courts use the term `unfair prejudice' for evidence that invites the jury to render a verdict on an improper emotional basis.\" <i>Varoudakis,</i> 233 F.3d at 122; <i>see also United States v. Currier,</i> 836 F.2d 11, 18 (1st Cir.1987) (noting that \"unfair prejudice\" is prejudice that causes \"a jury to base its decision on something other than the established proposition in the case\" (quoting 1 <i>Weinstein's Evidence</i> &#167; 403[03], 36-39 (1986))). Thus, while a court must weigh all potential \"prejudicial effect\" to the defendant when deciding whether to admit a prior conviction of the accused, it must weigh only the kind of prejudice that can be deemed \"unfair\" when deciding whether to admit the prior conviction of a government witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These distinctions &#8212; \"substantially outweighs\" versus \"outweighs,\" and \"unfair prejudice\" versus \"prejudicial effect\" &#8212; support the assertion of the <i>Weinstein</i> treatise that the standard for the admission of prior convictions of the accused is stricter than the standard for the admission of prior convictions of a government witness. These distinctions also recognize that the potential prejudice to the defendant from the admission of prior convictions is simply not the same as the potential prejudice to a government witness. In particular, there is a heightened risk that a jury will use evidence of a prior conviction of the accused to draw an impermissible propensity inference:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n virtually every case in which prior convictions are used to impeach the testifying defendant, the defendant faces a unique risk of prejudice &#8212; i.e., the danger that convictions that would be excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 404 will be misused by a jury as propensity evidence despite their introduction solely for impeachment purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 609 advisory committee's notes on 1990 amendment. <i>See also</i> Uviller, <i>supra,</i> at 802-803 (\"[T]he outstanding difference between harm to a defendant and harm to other witnesses is undeniable: A jury might conclude from the testifying defendant's criminal career (despite vociferous instructions from the court to the contrary) that he committed the crime charged because of a demonstrated propensity to engage in criminal conduct. That kind and degree of damage cannot be suffered by the prosecution or its witnesses....\"). Moreover, revelations of past convictions may inflame the jury. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Beahm,</i> 664 F.2d 414, 419 (4th Cir.1981) (excluding evidence of a prior conviction in part because \"it was likely to inflame the jury and thus prejudice the defendant\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, the prior convictions of a government witness are unlikely to inflame the jury or invite a propensity inference:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probability that prior convictions of an ordinary government witness will be unduly prejudicial is low in most criminal cases.

Orlando-Figueroa,</i> 229 F.3d 33, 46 (1st Cir.2000) (affirming district court's decision to exclude prior crime of government witness involving dishonesty where defense was able to impeach the witness with evidence of more recent dishonest acts), \"trial courts will be skeptical when the government objects to impeachment of its witnesses with prior convictions.\" Fed.

With respect to the use of prior convictions for impeachment, Rule 609 distinguishes between the accused and mere witnesses. A court may admit a conviction of the accused only if the probative value \"outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused.\" By contrast, a court shall admit a conviction of a government witness unless that conviction should be excluded under Rule 403. The burden under Rule 403 is on the party opposing admission, who must show that the probative value \"is <i>substantially outweighed</i> by the danger of <i>unfair prejudice.</i>\" In this case, in considering the admission of a prior conviction of Tse and a prior conviction of Williams, the government's principal witness, the district court appeared to apply a uniform standard of exclusion. If so, the failure to apply the different standards for exclusion was an error of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, any such error was harmless. \"[A] non-constitutional evidentiary error will be treated as harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Rose,</i> 104 F.3d 1408, 1414 (1st Cir.1997). The government bears the burden of persuasion to show that the error is harmless. <i>Id.</i> \"In conducting a harmless error analysis, the court `must mull the ruling in context, giving due weight to the totality of the circumstances'\" and avoid \"`unnecessarily interven[ing] in a process that &#8212; although imperfect &#8212; adequately protected defendant's rights.'\" <i>United States v. Wilkerson,</i> 251 F.3d 273, 280 (1st Cir.2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The excluded evidence of Williams's prior conviction was unmistakably cumulative. <i>Id.; see also Rose,</i> 104 F.3d at 1414. The jury heard evidence that Williams had been convicted of at least one crime; that he had made false statements to the grand jury and on a job application;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> that he had been paid a significant sum for his work as a DEA informant and had bought a new car soon after the November transaction; that he had not reported his earnings from the DEA on his tax return, despite having been told to do so; and finally, that he had dealt and used illicit drugs in the past. The jury had ample reason to closely scrutinize Williams's credibility in this case. It is highly probable that any error in excluding Williams's ABPO conviction had no impact on the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Traffic Stop</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general matter, a defendant has the right to cross-examine a prosecution witness about matters that might cause the witness to be biased against the defendant. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Barrett,</i> 766 F.2d 609, 614 (1st Cir.1985) (\"[A] defendant has a right to cross-examine an accomplice as to the nature of any agreement he had with the government or any expectation or hope that he may have that he will be treated leniently in exchange for his cooperation.\"). However, a defendant must lay a proper foundation before evidence of bias is admitted. <i>Bui v. DiPaolo,</i> 170 F.3d 232, 245 (1st Cir.1999) (\"[A] defendant ... must present a satisfactory foundation for the critical elements on which his hypothesis of bias depends.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, once the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to establish bias has been satisfied, the district court has the discretion to limit the scope of the bias inquiry. <i>See Bui,</i> 170 F.3d at 242 (\"[T]o the extent that the petitioner is suggesting that a criminal defendant has license to cross-question a prosecution witness concerning every conceivable theory of bias, ... he is plainly wrong.\"); <i>Barrett,</i> 766 F.2d at 614 (\"[T]he court has the discretion to limit cross-examination once the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to establish the potential bias of the accomplice-witness has been satisfied.\"). The district court's discretion allows it to exclude evidence of previously dismissed criminal charges against the witness. <i>United States v. Marrero-Ortiz,</i> 160 F.3d 768, 775 (1st Cir.1998) (finding no abuse of discretion where the district court prohibited the defendant from cross-examining a prosecution witness about a dismissed charge of weapons possession).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tse laid no foundation for his line of questioning about the traffic stop. The record does not indicate that charges against Williams were dropped in return for Williams's cooperation with the DEA, and Tse never attempted to offer evidence to this effect. Indeed, if such an agreement did exist, the government would have been obligated to disclose it along with its disclosures about Williams's compensation for his role in the DEA stings. <i>See Giglio v. United States,</i> 405 U.S. 150, 154-55, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) (holding that failure to disclose impeachment material against a government witness is a violation of due process). Tse's questioning relied solely on a theory of quid pro quo entirely unsupported by evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Tse's right to question Williams about his potential bias in favor of the government was satisfied by other lines of questioning. Tse established that Williams began working at the Boston Housing Authority &#8212; the same organization that employed one of the DEA task force members in the Tse sting operation &#8212; after he had testified as a cooperating witness in a previous trial. He established that Williams had been intermittently unemployed prior to working for the DEA, and that the DEA had, on certain occasions, helped him pay routine bills and expenses. He further established that Williams had purchased a new car in the fall of 1999, and that he had signed a loan application listing the DEA as his employer and a monthly income of $2,700. Williams's direct examination testimony established that the DEA had paid him $17,000 for his work as an informant. In light of this other evidence of bias, the district court acted well within its discretion in excluding evidence of the traffic stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Employment Application</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tse attempted to attack Williams's character for truthfulness by asking Williams about allegedly false statements that Williams had made on an employment application in 1997. Although the court initially ruled that Tse could not question Williams about the application, it agreed to revisit the issue on the next day of trial. When Tse renewed his request the following day, he said he would use the employment application to refresh Williams's memory if Williams could not recall the statements he had made on the application. The government argued that Tse could question Williams about the application but could not use the application to refresh Williams's memory because doing so would be tantamount to using extrinsic evidence to impeach, which is expressly prohibited by Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> The court agreed with the government, noting that the alleged misrepresentations at issue in this case were collateral because they did not relate directly to any matter at issue in the case. The court allowed Tse to question Williams about the employment application but prohibited Tse from using the application itself to refresh Williams's memory. Tse's counsel asked Williams about only two statements on the employment application: the dates of his employment at the Gillette company, and the statement that he had been a student at Bunker Hill Community College.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District courts have broad discretion to determine whether to permit the refreshing of a witness's memory. <i>See</i> 28 Wright &amp; Gold, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence</i> &#167; 6184 (1993). In this case, the district court was not obligated to allow Tse to refresh Williams's memory on the collateral issue of the content of the employment application.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Tse's questions about the employment application had no conceivable relevance other than to impeach Williams as untruthful. Using the employment application for this purpose would be a clear violation of Rule 608(b). The court acted well within its discretion in refusing to allow Tse to refresh Williams's memory on matters entirely collateral to the case. <i>See United States v. Marino,</i> 277 F.3d 11, 24 (1st Cir.2002) (excluding testimony contradicting the witness's characterization of his activities as a drug dealer as extrinsic evidence on a collateral matter in violation of Rule 608(b), even though the truthfulness of the witness's testimony was critical to the prosecution's case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During redirect examination the prosecution asked Williams if the DEA had offered him relocation money as part of his compensation for acting as a cooperating witness. Tse objected. The court initially sustained the objection, but the prosecution asked to be heard on the matter. At sidebar, the prosecution explained that, as part of his agreement with the DEA, if Williams lied on the stand during his testimony, the DEA would not provide him with any relocation funds. Without those funds, Williams would be stuck in Massachusetts even if he feared retaliation from some of the drug traffickers that he had helped the DEA arrest. Thus, Williams had an incentive to testify truthfully. The court changed its earlier ruling and allowed the prosecution to proceed. The subsequent exchange was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q.

Williams's redirect testimony did not suggest that Tse was in prison or that Tse had been the source of death threats against Williams. During his earlier testimony, Williams made clear that he had participated in several other operations with the DEA, buying drugs both from people that he already knew and from people whom he met only when he attempted to purchase drugs from them at the DEA's direction. Neither Williams nor the prosecution suggested that Tse was the source of the threats against Williams's life.

The DEA agents outfitted Williams with an audio transmitter called a \"kel.\" The device allowed the agents to listen to and record Williams's conversations, but did not allow them to communicate with Williams. After searching Williams and his car to ensure that he did not have any drugs or cash, the agents gave him $450 and instructed him to purchase crack cocaine from Tse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 6:30 P.M., Williams drove to Tse's residence in Mattapan, Massachusetts. The DEA recorded the ensuing conversation in which Williams told Tse that he had only $450 and that he wanted to buy a half ounce of crack cocaine for that amount. Tse told Williams to return in ten minutes. Williams left Tse's residence and again met with the DEA agents. They instructed him to return to Tse's house to make the drug purchase. At approximately 7:10 P.M. Williams returned to Tse's house where Tse was on the phone, apparently receiving directions to a nearby location. After the phone call, Tse told Williams \"we're on,\" and said that they needed to travel \"just around the corner.\" Tse and Williams left the house and entered Williams's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Williams and Tse drove off, the DEA agents lost the signal from Williams's kel transmitter. Despite their attempts to follow Williams, the agents were not able to record any other conversations between Williams and Tse that evening. However, shortly after Williams and Tse drove off, a member of the DEA surveillance team saw Williams's car parked on a nearby street, only a few blocks from Tse's residence. At least one person was sitting in the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Williams testified that he and Tse drove to a house only a few minutes away. Williams remained in the car while Tse spoke with a man in the doorway and entered the building. According to Williams, Tse returned several minutes later and gave a bag of crack cocaine to Williams. Williams and Tse then drove back to Tse's house, where Tse gave Williams a scrap of paper with Tse's pager number written on it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Williams dropped Tse off at his residence, he met with the DEA agents and handed over the drugs and the scrap of paper on which Tse had written his pager number. DEA laboratory tests confirmed that the drugs that Tse had allegedly supplied to Williams included 11.2 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 2, 1999, Williams again participated in a DEA operation targeting Tse. He used the pager number that Tse had given him after the previous transaction to contact Tse. In a recorded call, Williams and Tse spoke in a mutually understood code about a drug transaction. Tse agreed to sell 62 grams of cocaine to Williams for $1,800. Williams was again outfitted with a kel transmitter, and DEA agents followed Williams to the meeting place with Tse. When Tse arrived, he provided Williams with powder cocaine. This time, the DEA agents were able to record the entire transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 27, 2000, a grand jury charged Tse with two counts of distributing a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). Count one alleged that Tse had distributed crack cocaine during the November 24 transaction; count two alleged that Tse had distributed powder cocaine during the February 2 transaction. On December 12, 2000, Tse pled guilty to count two and proceeded to a jury trial on count one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the DEA agents had been unable to record the November 24 transaction, the government relied heavily on Williams's testimony to describe the events of that evening. Williams was not an ideal witness, and Tse's primary strategy was to discredit Williams's testimony. Through both direct and cross-examination, the jury heard, <i>inter alia,</i> that Williams had used and sold drugs in the past, had been convicted of at least one crime, had made inaccurate statements to the grand jury about his prior involvement with drugs,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> had received substantial compensation for his work as a DEA informant, and had purchased a new car shortly after receiving payments from the DEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial lasted four days, ending on December 15, 2000. Despite Tse's aggressive impeachment of Williams's testimony, the jury found Tse guilty of distributing a controlled substance during the November 24 transaction. On April 25, 2001, the district court sentenced Tse to 120 months in prison on each count (as noted, he had pled guilty to count two of the indictment) to be served concurrently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Tse claims that the district court made a number of errors. First, Tse argues that the district court erred in admitting evidence of the February transaction. Second, Tse argues that the court gave inadequate limiting instructions to the jury about the proper use of evidence of the February transaction. Third, he argues that the district court erred in limiting his cross-examination of Williams by preventing him from (1) impeaching Williams's credibility by introducing evidence that Williams had been convicted of assault and battery against a police officer, (2) introducing evidence that charges against Williams stemming from a traffic stop were dismissed after Williams began cooperating with the DEA, and (3) refreshing Williams's memory with an employment application he had filled out several years earlier. Finally, Tse argues that the district court impermissibly allowed the government to solicit prejudicial evidence from Williams during redirect examination. We address each of Tse's arguments in turn, relating the relevant details of the trial where appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government sought to introduce evidence of the February transaction, arguing that such evidence had \"special relevance\" under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The government offered several theories of admissibility. First, it argued that the February transaction demonstrated Tse's intent in meeting with Williams on November 24. Because Tse had argued in his opening statement that his November meeting with Williams did not involve a drug transaction, the government reasoned that evidence of Tse's intent was at issue in the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Second, the government argued that the February evidence was admissible to boost Williams's credibility since the February transaction was similar to Williams's description of the November transaction. Third, the government argued that tape of the February transaction showed that Tse had sold drugs to Williams on previous occasions because, when Williams called to arrange the February deal, both he and Tse began speaking about the transaction in a mutually understood code without an initial discussion of whether Tse could procure drugs. Finally, the government argued that the February transaction demonstrated a \"criminal association\" between Tse and Williams, creating an inference that, if their purpose for meeting on February 2 was to carry out a drug transaction, their purpose for meeting on November 24 was likely to carry out a similar transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tse objected that evidence of the February transaction had no special relevance because he had admitted that he and Williams were together on November 24 during the time of the alleged drug transaction. He argued that there was therefore no need to admit evidence to demonstrate the relationship between Williams and Tse. Rather, evidence of the February transaction could only be used by the jury to draw a forbidden propensity inference: if Tse had sold drugs to Williams on February 2, he likely sold drugs to Williams on November 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing arguments on this issue, the district court admitted the evidence, ruling that the evidence had \"special relevance\" within the scope of Rule 404(b) because it demonstrated that Tse and Williams had a \"criminal association\" in February.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The court did not specify the probative value of this \"criminal association,\" stating only that the criminal association was \"one that the government may have evidence of.\" The court also ruled that the probative value of the February transaction was not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Thus, the court ruled that evidence of the February transaction was not barred by Rule 403.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The defense objected to these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court's determination that prior bad act evidence was admissible pursuant to Rules 404(b) and 403. <i>See United States v.

A district court may admit evidence of a defendant's other bad acts only if that evidence meets the requirements of both Rule 404(b) and Rule 403.

Evidence of a criminal association among the alleged conspirators can be probative in several respects. It can demonstrate the background of a relationship, a collaboration among several parties, or a mutual trust between conspirators. <i>See Varoudakis,</i> 233 F.3d at 121 (admitting evidence of a prior bad act to demonstrate mutual trust between alleged conspirators); <i>Escobar-de Jesus,</i> 187 F.3d at 169 (\"[E]vidence of other bad acts ... can be admitted to explain the background, formation and development of the illegal relationship ... and, more specifically, to help the jury understand the basis for the co-conspirators' relationship of mutual trust . . . .\") (citations omitted); <i>Procopio,</i> 88 F.3d at 29 (stating that evidence of a subsequent criminal association \"was helpful to the government's claim that the two men had collaborated\" in a prior robbery).

We disagree. Tse's defense &#8212; that he was with Williams on November 24 but that he did not participate in a drug transaction on that day &#8212; makes Tse's relationship with Williams \"directly in issue and material to the case\" and thus permits the court to admit evidence of a subsequent criminal association. <i>Escobar-de Jesus,</i> 187 F.3d at 169. <i>See also Rodriguez,</i> 215 F.3d at 119 (holding admissible evidence of another of defendant's drug ventures with the same participants to rebut defendant's claim that, on the occasion of the charged crime, he was an innocent bystander); <i>United States v.

Evidence of the February transaction between Williams and Tse, including their use of coded language, indicated that they had collaborated on similar transactions in the past and that they both understood the nature of their meeting. Although the government did not have to demonstrate an agreement, as it would have in a conspiracy case, this evidence was still critical to demonstrate the nature of Tse's association with Williams, which helped to refute Tse's claim that their November meeting was innocent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of other bad acts always carries with it a danger of a forbidden propensity inference. But Rule 404(b) requires only that there be some other permissible reason, subject to the requirements of Rule 403, to admit the evidence. Here, evidence of the February transaction refuted Tse's claim that his association with Williams was innocent. Thus, the district court properly admitted the evidence under Rule 404(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After ruling on the admissibility of the February evidence, the district court gave the following limiting instruction to the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant is charged in this indictment with an offense said to have occurred on November 24, 1998.

The February '99 incident, if it occurred, if you find that it occurred, which is the first question, and if you do, you may consider it for that purpose if it bears on the defendant's knowing and intentional participation in a similar transaction in November.

There is a difference [in standards of admissibility], but I'm not sure it's a pertinent difference with respect to this.\" The court added: \"I don't know that there's, in fact, a different standard, except that maybe it's a caution to make sure that it has probative value. . . .\" Finally, the court determined that it would \"keep them both out,\" ruling that neither Williams's ABPO conviction nor Tse's ABPO conviction was admissible.

When the witness is other than the accused, such evidence \"shall be admitted, subject to Rule 403.\" <i>Id.</i> Rule 403 in turn states that \"evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This dual approach is the result of a 1990 amendment to Rule 609.

Thus, there is no doubt that we must apply a Rule 403 analysis to prior convictions of government witnesses in a criminal prosecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rule 609 sets out two different evidentiary standards for admitting prior convictions for impeachment, it does not make clear whether the court's application of each standard requires a substantively different analysis. Some commentators have suggested that Rule 609 provides greater protection to the accused than it does to other witnesses in the use of prior convictions for impeachment. <i>See</i> Weinstein, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 609.02 (\"If the witness to be impeached is the accused in a criminal case, the rule establishes a more stringent discretionary standard [for admissibility].\"). Others are skeptical that the difference between the two balancing tests is sufficiently different to draw a practical distinction in the evidentiary showing required for admission of a prior conviction. <i>See</i> Uviller, <i>supra,</i> at 800 (suggesting that \"the practical possibility of such fine calibration of the danger of prejudice is dubious.\"). Although \"the nature of the distinction is elusive,\" Uviller, <i>supra,</i> at 799, the drafting of the rule suggests that the distinction is intentional. If the drafters had wanted to apply the same evidentiary test to all prior convictions, they could easily have stated a universal rule instead of differentiating between the accused and all other witnesses. We therefore examine closely the two standards to determine the precise nature of their differences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To describe accurately the distinctions in Rule 609(a)(1), however, we must first unravel a linguistic oddity in its language. With respect to a witness other than the accused, the rule provides that a conviction \"shall be admitted, subject to Rule 403.\" The instruction that convictions \"shall be admitted\" indicates that Rule 609 is a rule of inclusion; any conviction meeting Rule 609's requirements will be admitted. However, the reference to Rule 403 complicates the analysis. That rule, applicable when a party objects to otherwise relevant evidence, provides that evidence \"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\" Fed.R.Evid. 403. Thus, by its language, Rule 403 is a rule of exclusion. These conflicting formulations of inclusion in rule 609 and exclusion in Rule 403 raise some uncertainty about whether the impeaching party (here Tse, who sought to impeach Williams with his prior conviction) bears the burden of demonstrating the superior probative value of the prior convictions to justify admission of the evidence, or whether the impeached party (here the government, which sought to avoid the impeachment of Williams with his prior conviction) bears the burden of demonstrating the danger of unfair prejudice to justify exclusion of the evidence. <i>See</i> Uviller, <i>supra,</i> at 799-800 (noting this distinction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The advisory committee notes offer some clarification regarding the use of a prior conviction to impeach government witnesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The notes state that the \"[Rule 403] balancing test protects ... the government in criminal cases\" and that \"[o]nly when the government is able to point to a real danger of prejudice that is sufficient to outweigh substantially the probative value of the conviction for impeachment purposes will the conviction be excluded.\" Fed.R.Evid. 609 advisory committee's notes on 1990 amendment. Therefore, although the proponent of the admission of the evidence of a prior conviction is the accused who seeks to impeach the government witness, the government bears the burden of protecting its witnesses from such impeachment by demonstrating to the court, pursuant to Rule 403's exclusionary rule, that the probative value of the conviction at issue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, or the other grounds for exclusion noted in Rule 403.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This standard of prejudice differs from the standard of prejudice applicable to the court's consideration of requests by the government to impeach a defendant with prior convictions.

Thus, while a court must weigh all potential \"prejudicial effect\" to the defendant when deciding whether to admit a prior conviction of the accused, it must weigh only the kind of prejudice that can be deemed \"unfair\" when deciding whether to admit the prior conviction of a government witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These distinctions &#8212; \"substantially outweighs\" versus \"outweighs,\" and \"unfair prejudice\" versus \"prejudicial effect\" &#8212; support the assertion of the <i>Weinstein</i> treatise that the standard for the admission of prior convictions of the accused is stricter than the standard for the admission of prior convictions of a government witness.

With respect to the use of prior convictions for impeachment, Rule 609 distinguishes between the accused and mere witnesses. A court may admit a conviction of the accused only if the probative value \"outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused.\" By contrast, a court shall admit a conviction of a government witness unless that conviction should be excluded under Rule 403. The burden under Rule 403 is on the party opposing admission, who must show that the probative value \"is <i>substantially outweighed</i> by the danger of <i>unfair prejudice.</i>\" In this case, in considering the admission of a prior conviction of Tse and a prior conviction of Williams, the government's principal witness, the district court appeared to apply a uniform standard of exclusion. If so, the failure to apply the different standards for exclusion was an error of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, any such error was harmless. \"[A] non-constitutional evidentiary error will be treated as harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\" <i>United States v.

The government bears the burden of persuasion to show that the error is harmless. <i>Id.</i> \"In conducting a harmless error analysis, the court `must mull the ruling in context, giving due weight to the totality of the circumstances'\" and avoid \"`unnecessarily interven[ing] in a process that &#8212; although imperfect &#8212; adequately protected defendant's rights.'\" <i>United States v.

The record does not indicate that charges against Williams were dropped in return for Williams's cooperation with the DEA, and Tse never attempted to offer evidence to this effect. Indeed, if such an agreement did exist, the government would have been obligated to disclose it along with its disclosures about Williams's compensation for his role in the DEA stings. <i>See Giglio v.

He established that Williams had been intermittently unemployed prior to working for the DEA, and that the DEA had, on certain occasions, helped him pay routine bills and expenses. He further established that Williams had purchased a new car in the fall of 1999, and that he had signed a loan application listing the DEA as his employer and a monthly income of $2,700. Williams's direct examination testimony established that the DEA had paid him $17,000 for his work as an informant.

Although the court initially ruled that Tse could not question Williams about the application, it agreed to revisit the issue on the next day of trial. When Tse renewed his request the following day, he said he would use the employment application to refresh Williams's memory if Williams could not recall the statements he had made on the application. The government argued that Tse could question Williams about the application but could not use the application to refresh Williams's memory because doing so would be tantamount to using extrinsic evidence to impeach, which is expressly prohibited by Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> The court agreed with the government, noting that the alleged misrepresentations at issue in this case were collateral because they did not relate directly to any matter at issue in the case. The court allowed Tse to question Williams about the employment application but prohibited Tse from using the application itself to refresh Williams's memory. Tse's counsel asked Williams about only two statements on the employment application: the dates of his employment at the Gillette company, and the statement that he had been a student at Bunker Hill Community College.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District courts have broad discretion to determine whether to permit the refreshing of a witness's memory. <i>See</i> 28 Wright &amp; Gold, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence</i> &#167; 6184 (1993).

The court acted well within its discretion in refusing to allow Tse to refresh Williams's memory on matters entirely collateral to the case. <i>See United States v.

Tse objected. The court initially sustained the objection, but the prosecution asked to be heard on the matter. At sidebar, the prosecution explained that, as part of his agreement with the DEA, if Williams lied on the stand during his testimony, the DEA would not provide him with any relocation funds. Without those funds, Williams would be stuck in Massachusetts even if he feared retaliation from some of the drug traffickers that he had helped the DEA arrest. Thus, Williams had an incentive to testify truthfully. The court changed its earlier ruling and allowed the prosecution to proceed.

Williams's redirect testimony did not suggest that Tse was in prison or that Tse had been the source of death threats against Williams. During his earlier testimony, Williams made clear that he had participated in several other operations with the DEA, buying drugs both from people that he already knew and from people whom he met only when he attempted to purchase drugs from them at the DEA's direction. Neither Williams nor the prosecution suggested that Tse was the source of the threats against Williams's life.

Moreover, both of these rationales are variations on the same theme: that Tse's relationship with Williams was not innocent.
