Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Mark Booker, with whom Law Offices of Mark Booker was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Daniel G. Cromack, Assistant Attorney General, with whom\nMartha Coakley, Attorney General, and Bryan R. Killian, Assistant\nAttorney General, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 15, 2010\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Plaintiff Althea Booker filed suit\n\nagainst her employer, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health\n\n(the Lemuel Shattuck Hospital), the Executive Office of Health and\n\nHuman Services, and certain individual defendants. A jury returned\n\na verdict in favor of defendants on Booker's claims of retaliation\n\nunder federal and state law, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a); Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 151B, § 4(4), and tortious interference with contractual\n\nemployment relations.      The court then denied Booker's post-trial\n\nmotions.\n\n           On appeal, Booker first contends that the court's jury\n\ninstruction   on   the   meaning   of    a   \"materially    adverse       action\"\n\nmisstated the legal standard governing her retaliation claim.\n\nAlthough we conclude that the adverse action instruction was\n\nproblematic, we reject that claim of error.\n\n           Booker also argues that the court erroneously refused to\n\ninstruct the jury on the doctrine of spoliation.            Booker requested\n\nan instruction that the jury could draw an adverse inference based\n\non the deletion of emails concerning Booker by certain hospital\n\nemployees.    We   conclude   that      Booker   failed    to   lay   a   proper\n\nevidentiary foundation for a spoliation instruction and therefore\n\nthe court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give it.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f                                        I.\n\n                 Booker, an African-American woman, began working at the\n\nLemuel Shattuck Hospital (the hospital) as a telephone operator in\n\nthe late 1980s.          In 2001, she was promoted to \"Communications\n\nDispatcher II.\"          Booker's responsibilities in her new position\n\nincluded dispatching the hospital's campus police officers and\n\nsupervising the telephone operators, or \"Communication Dispatcher\n\nI's,\"       who     staffed     the   communications        department.       The\n\ncommunications department performed functions such as screening and\n\nreceiving incoming calls, transferring calls to other departments,\n\nreceiving emergency calls from within the hospital, assisting with\n\ndispatching, and greeting visitors.\n\n                 On September 9, 2003, Booker met with Shawn McMullen,\n\nthen       her   immediate    supervisor,    and   Edward   Nicosia,   then   the\n\nhospital's Deputy Director of Facilities Management,1 to express\n\nconcern that she was receiving telephone calls from her staff while\n\nshe was off duty.             Nicosia explained that under her collective\n\nbargaining agreement she was entitled to \"call-back pay\" for work-\n\nrelated calls received at home.                Later that day, Nicosia and\n\nMcMullen circulated a memorandum to Booker's staff discouraging\n\nthem from calling their supervisor at home except in emergency\n\nsituations, and copied Booker.\n\n\n       1\n       Later in 2003, Nicosia became the Acting Director of\nFacilities, and sometime in the end of 2004 or beginning of 2005,\nhe became the Director of Facilities.\n\n                                        -3-\n\f           Several months later, on December 15, 2003, Booker hand-\n\ndelivered a letter to Nicosia complaining that the hospital had\n\ndiscriminated against her based on race by failing to compensate\n\nher for off-duty calls.    In the letter, Booker asserted that she\n\nwas owed call-back pay for seventy-five calls she had received at\n\nhome over the past two years, and that McMullen, who is white, was\n\nreceiving off-duty calls from Booker's staff that should have gone\n\nto her.   She stated that the sole reason for this unequal treatment\n\nwas race and that her letter represented \"a relatively whispering\n\nsalvo in what could become a vigorous public challenge of rampant\n\ninstitutional racism at the Hospital.\"\n\n           Later that same day, Booker confronted McMullen in the\n\ncampus police department, located in the hospital's main lobby. In\n\na raised voice, Booker asked McMullen why members of her staff were\n\ncalling him after hours instead of her and whether the hospital had\n\na policy of only paying white supervisors for off-duty calls.   She\n\nasserted that this was racism and she would speak with a lawyer.\n\nIn early January 2004, Nicosia and McMullen had a meeting with\n\nBooker to discuss the December 15 incident.   Booker apologized for\n\nconfronting McMullen in such a public setting, but did not retract\n\nher complaints.    Ultimately, in late January, she was issued a\n\nwritten warning for her behavior.      On February 6, 2004, Booker\n\nfiled the first of several administrative complaints with the\n\nMassachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) and the\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fEqual       Employment      Opportunity    Commission      (EEOC),   alleging    race\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation.2\n\n                In the months that followed Booker's December 15 letter\n\nof complaint, Nicosia took several actions related to payroll and\n\ntimekeeping procedures that displeased Booker.                     In January 2004,\n\nNicosia removed the communications logbook from Booker's desk and\n\nreplaced it with a new logbook.                   Members of the communications\n\ndepartment       used    the    log   to   record    information     such   as   shift\n\nassignments, staff absences, and phone calls to staff at home, and\n\nthe    logbook       removed    by    Nicosia     contained   entries    related   to\n\nBooker's claim for call-back pay.                 The following month, Booker and\n\nNicosia had a disagreement about allocation of personal time.\n\nNoticing that Booker had missed twelve hours of work but had not\n\nreported the absences on her timesheet, Nicosia deducted twelve\n\nhours of her personal time. When Booker discovered this deduction,\n\nshe informed Nicosia that she preferred to use a combination of\n\nsick time, vacation time, and leave without pay to cover the time\n\noff.        Although Nicosia asked Booker to make this correction by\n\nsubmitting a payroll adjustment form, she instead called the\n\npayroll department and had them make the change. After discovering\n\nthat        Booker   made   the   payroll       change   without   the   appropriate\n\npaperwork,       Nicosia       submitted    a    payroll   adjustment    form    again\n\n\n        2\n        Booker filed a second administrative complaint for\nretaliation in May 2005 and a third administrative complaint\nsometime thereafter.\n\n                                            -5-\n\fdesignating Booker's absences as personal time. Booker complained,\n\nbut Nicosia refused to have her personal time returned.\n\n          Finally, in February 2005, Nicosia learned that Booker\n\nwas logging her time in the communications log and reviewing her\n\nown timesheets as well as those of her staff.       Nicosia directed\n\nHuman Resources to make changes so that Booker was required to\n\nenter her time in the so-called steward's log and submit her weekly\n\ntimesheets to her immediate supervisor for review.\n\n          Changes were also made to Booker's job responsibilities\n\nover the 2004-2005 period.     In the fall of 2004, Richard Wong\n\njoined the hospital as the director of safety and security and\n\nreplaced McMullen as Booker's immediate supervisor.          Sometime\n\nthereafter, Wong hired additional police officers and informed\n\nBooker that whenever at least five officers were on duty, an\n\nofficer would perform dispatching duties. Booker continued to fill\n\nin as a dispatcher on an as-needed basis, around four or five times\n\nper month, but it was no longer a regular part of her job duties.\n\nWong also requested that Booker get trained to perform mailroom\n\nduties, which consisted of sorting incoming mail in the morning and\n\nmetering outgoing mail in the afternoon, so that she could cover\n\nthe mailroom on occasion. Other employees, including Wong, covered\n\nthe mailroom when the regular mailroom clerk was out, and the job\n\ndescription for Booker's position, Communications Dispatcher II,\n\nlisted   sorting   and   delivering   mail   as   one   of   her   job\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fresponsibilities.        However, Booker refused the mailroom training\n\nand resisted performing mailroom duties, viewing them as less\n\nprestigious than her other duties. As a result, she rarely covered\n\nthe mailroom, filling in there for the first time on December 30,\n\n2005.\n\n            Finally, in June 2005, Booker was suspended for one day\n\nwithout pay following a confrontation with a campus police officer.\n\nThe officer, hurrying to get to an assigned location at the\n\nhospital on time, exchanged his radio for the radio on Booker's\n\ndesk, which had a belt clip.      Raising her voice, she chastised him\n\nfor taking her radio and called him derogatory names.               People\n\npassing through the busy hospital lobby observed the incident.\n\n            In October 2005, Booker filed this action in federal\n\ndistrict court against the Massachusetts Department of Public\n\nHealth (DPH), the Executive Office of Health and Human Services\n\n(EOHHS),    and   four    individual    defendants,   including   Nicosia.3\n\nBooker alleged, inter alia, that defendants retaliated against her\n\nfor complaining about discriminatory withholding of callback pay\n\nand for filing complaints with the MCAD,4 and that the individual\n\n\n        3\n       The individual defendants named in the complaint were\nNicosia, McMullen, the hospital's Executive Director Paul Romary,\nand Director of Labor Relations Jennifer Foley.\n     4\n       Although Booker brought her retaliation claims under both\nstate and federal law, the parties have not suggested that the\nstate and federal antiretaliation provisions differ in any way\nmaterial to the issues on appeal.       Therefore, we focus our\nanalysis on the standards for retaliation under Title VII and do\n\n                                       -7-\n\fdefendants intentionally interfered with her contractual employment\n\nrelationships.     Following pretrial dispositions not at issue in\n\nthis appeal,5 Booker proceeded to trial on her retaliation claims\n\nagainst DPH, EOHHS and Nicosia (hereafter, defendants), and her\n\ntortious interference claim against Nicosia.\n\n          At trial, the court instructed the jury as to the actions\n\nthat Booker maintained were retaliatory:\n\n          [T]he written warning issued in January of\n          2004; the removal of the communications\n          logbook from the desk where she worked; the\n          February 2004 incident involving Mr. Nicosia's\n          reduction of her personal time for an\n          unreported absence; the requirement that she\n          sign for her time on the stewards' log rather\n          than the communication dispatchers' log; the\n          reduction in her police dispatching duties;\n          her   assignment   to  mailroom   duties   and\n          training, and her one-day suspension in June\n          of 2005.\n\n          After a five-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in\n\nfavor of the defendants on all claims.   The district court denied\n\nBooker's post-judgment motions for judgment as a matter of law and\n\nfor a new trial.     On appeal, Booker contends, as she did in her\n\n\nnot separately analyze the analogous retaliation provision under\nstate law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 4(4).\n     5\n      The court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on\nBooker's claims for racial discrimination, interference with the\nright to be free from discrimination, and aiding, abetting,\ninciting or compelling discrimination.         Booker voluntarily\ndismissed her claims for libel and intentional infliction of\nemotional distress against all defendants, and dismissed her\ntortious interference claim against all defendants except Nicosia.\nFinally, the court dismissed all remaining claims against Romary,\nFoley and McMullen.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fmotion for a new trial, that (1) the district court improperly\n\ninstructed the jury on the required showing of a materially adverse\n\naction for purposes of her retaliation claim, and (2) the court\n\nerred in refusing to give a spoliation jury instruction.        We\n\naddress each contention in turn.\n\n                                  II.\n\nA. Retaliation Jury Instruction\n\n          At trial, the district court instructed the jury on the\n\nrequisite showing of a materially adverse action under Title VII:\n\n          Under federal and state law, Ms. Booker must\n          prove . . . by a preponderance of the evidence\n          . . . that the desire to retaliate because of\n          [her complaints of discrimination] was a\n          motivating and determinative factor in any\n          decision to alter Ms. Booker's terms and\n          conditions of employment in a materially\n          adverse manner . . . .\n\n          An employment action to be adverse must\n          materially change the terms and conditions of\n          the plaintiff's employment. Examples the law\n          gives   include   demotions,  disadvantageous\n          transfers   or   assignments,  the   loss  of\n          promotions, unwarranted negative evaluations,\n          toleration of harassing conduct by co-\n          employees,    and   reprisals   intended   to\n          discourage other employees from complaining\n          about unlawful practices or reprisals that\n          might be perceived in that way by other\n          employees looking at them reasonably.\n\n(Emphasis added.)6\n\n\n     6\n       The next paragraph of the instructions described what were\nnot adverse actions, though this portion of the instruction is not\nat issue:\n          Adverse job actions do not include hurt\n          feelings,     subjective     disappointments,\n\n                                  -9-\n\f          Booker contends on appeal that this instruction misstated\n\nthe legal standard applicable to her retaliation claim as set forth\n\nin Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53\n\n(2006).      First, she contends that the instruction erroneously\n\nrequired a showing that an adverse action affect the terms and\n\nconditions of her employment.      Second, she argues that the final\n\nphrase in the exemplary list of adverse actions, beginning with\n\n\"and reprisals,\" improperly required her to demonstrate that the\n\nreprisals be intended to discourage, or reasonably be perceived as\n\nintended to discourage, employee complaints.\n\n          1. Standard of Review\n\n          A party who objects to an instruction must \"stat[e]\n\ndistinctly    the   matter   objected    to   and   the   grounds   for   the\n\nobjection.\"     Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c)(1).            Under the procedure\n\noutlined in Rule 51, before the trial court charges the jury it\n\nmust inform the parties of its proposed instructions and receive\n\nany objections.     Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(b); Surprenant v. Rivas, 424\n\nF.3d 5, 15 (1st Cir. 2005).         An objection made at that time\n\n\"preserves the underlying issue for appeal.\"         Surprenant, 424 F.3d\n\nat 15 (emphasis added) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c)(2)(A)).              If,\n\n\n\n          disillusionment over an employer's actions, or\n          expected   losses    of    job    function  or\n          responsibilities because of a business or\n          corporate reorganization.     It also does not\n          [in]clude   everyday    workplace   banter  or\n          teasing, which all of us are familiar with.\n\n                                  -10-\n\fhowever, a party is \"not informed of an instruction or action on a\n\nrequest\" during the precharge conference, the party may object\n\n\"promptly after learning that the instruction or request will be,\n\nor has been, given or refused.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c)(2)(B).            The\n\nrequirements of Rule 51 \"are not to be taken lightly\" and \"there is\n\na high price to be paid for noncompliance.\"            DeCaro v. Hasbro,\n\nInc., 580 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir. 2009).        Failure to comply with the\n\nrule ordinarily results in forfeiture of \"the objection to which\n\nthe failure relates,\" and we review forfeited objections only for\n\nplain error.    Id. (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(d)(2)).         Our strict\n\nenforcement    of   the   object-or-forfeit    rule   serves   \"to   compel\n\nlitigants to afford the trial court an opportunity to cure [a]\n\ndefective instruction and to prevent the litigants from ensuring a\n\nnew trial in the event of an adverse verdict by covertly relying on\n\nthe error.\"    Flynn v. AK Peters, Ltd., 377 F.3d 13, 25 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n          In this case, the court discussed its tentative jury\n\ninstructions with the parties at a sidebar conference held before\n\nthe jury was charged.7     The court stated that it planned to add, at\n\nthe end of the adverse action instruction, the phrase \"Reprisals\n\nintended to discourage other employees from complaining about\n\nunlawful practices.\"      Booker's counsel objected, stating:\n\n\n\n     7\n       The court's tentative instructions apparently were not made\npart of the record.\n\n                                  -11-\n\f            I am concerned that, as I heard the\n            instruction, that the employer intended to\n            deter other employees, I don't think it's\n            necessary that he intended to deter, so long\n            as it was reasonably foreseeable that it would\n            deter. In other words, I don't believe there\n            is an intention requirement as to the\n            deterrence. It's only that it be a deterrent.\n            He must intend to retaliate but the effect\n            must, in effect, deter a reasonable employee,\n            not that he intended to deter others. . . .\n\n            The Burlington Court, talked about and used\n            language, \"an adverse action consists of any\n            action that may dissuade a reason[able]\n            employee from engaging in protected activity.\"\n\nIn response, the court noted that it \"might add, 'Or reasonably\n\nwould have been perceived by the employe[e],' but I just don't want\n\nto turn this into a strict-liability tort.\"          Booker's counsel did\n\nnot voice any further objection.            The court gave the modified\n\ninstruction to the jury, stating that examples of adverse actions\n\ninclude \"reprisals intended to discourage other employees from\n\ncomplaining about unlawful practices or reprisals that might be\n\nperceived    in   that   way   by   other   employees      looking       at   them\n\nreasonably.\"       (Emphasis   added.)       The   court    held     a    sidebar\n\nconference after the charge, inviting any \"[]new\" objections, but\n\nBooker's counsel raised no objection to the instruction as given.\n\n            As this account makes clear, Booker never objected in the\n\ndistrict court on the first ground she presses on appeal -- that\n\nthe instruction improperly stated that an adverse action must\n\n\"materially change the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's\n\nemployment.\"      That objection is therefore forfeited.           See Boston\n\n                                    -12-\n\fGas Co. v. Century Indem. Co., 529 F.3d 8, 19 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(holding that objection was forfeited where party made an objection\n\nto court's proposed instruction, but on grounds unrelated to the\n\naspect it criticized on appeal).\n\n          Booker did object at the precharge conference on the\n\nground that the tentative instruction improperly required that a\n\nmaterially    adverse   action   be    intended   to   discourage   employee\n\ncomplaints.   However, the court then proposed adding instructional\n\nlanguage to address Booker's concern, and Booker did not object\n\nafter being apprised of the court's proposed modification or after\n\nhearing the modified instruction given to the jury.           The \"purpose\n\nof a sidebar objection is to inform the judge exactly what he got\n\nwrong and what he should do to remedy the incipient harm.\"           DeCaro,\n\n580 F.3d at 61.    By failing to object to the modified instruction\n\neither before or after the charge, Booker failed to inform the\n\ncourt that she believed the instruction was still problematic,\n\nspecify the grounds for her objection, or give the court an\n\nopportunity to correct any error.            Therefore, this objection is\n\nalso forfeited.    See, e.g., Kirk v. Reed Tool Co., 247 F. App'x\n\n485, 486 (5th Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (unpublished) (\"[W]hile\n\n[plaintiff] may have objected to the original jury charge, he did\n\nnot object to the supplemental charge.            Therefore, our review is\n\nonly for plain error.\"); Cooney v. Booth, 28 F. App'x 148, 151 (3d\n\nCir. 2002) (unpublished) (reviewing instruction for plain error\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fbecause \"absent a specific objection following the actual charge,\n\n[the court] had no way of knowing that its efforts to accommodate\n\nthe general objection made at the [precharge] conference had not\n\nbeen wholly successful\").8\n\n           Noting that Rule 51 was amended effective December 1,\n\n2003, Booker argues that her objections were properly preserved\n\nunder the amended rule.           We have acknowledged that the 2003\n\namendments to Rule 51 made changes to the procedure for lodging\n\nobjections.    Under the former version of the rule, objections were\n\nnot preserved unless they were \"taken at sidebar after the trial\n\njudge had charged the jury.\"           Surprenant, 424 F.3d at 15 n.3\n\n(emphasis added).        Thus, even if a party properly objected to a\n\nproposed instruction prior to the jury charge and the court then\n\ngave the challenged instruction, that objection was forfeited\n\nunless the party renewed the objection after the jury charge. See,\n\ne.g., McGrath v. Spirito, 733 F.2d 967, 968-69 (1st Cir. 1984).            We\n\nhave also noted that the 2003 amendments \"were designed in part to\n\nease the burden on parties in preserving their objections to\n\ninstructions where the district court had already made a definitive\n\nruling,   on   the    record,   rejecting   a   request   for   a   particular\n\ninstruction.\"        Colón-Millín v. Sears Roebuck De Puerto Rico, Inc.,\n\n455 F.3d 30, 40 n.7 (1st Cir. 2006).        However, the 2003 amendments\n\n\n\n     8\n      Although the cited opinions are unpublished, we rely on them\nfor their persuasive value.\n\n                                    -14-\n\fdo not assist Booker here.             Nothing in the amended rule suggests\n\nthat a party may preserve a claim of error by objecting to a\n\ntentative instruction at the precharge conference, but then failing\n\nto object after the instruction is modified to accommodate the\n\ninitial objection.9\n\n               Therefore, we review the legal standards stated in the\n\njury instructions only for plain error.               In doing so, we bear two\n\nprecepts in mind.          The first is that the district court has wide\n\ndiscretion over the particular words it chooses to convey those\n\nstandards.          See Johnson v. Spencer Press of Me., Inc., 364 F.3d\n\n368, 378 (1st Cir. 2004); Interstate Litho Corp. v. Brown, 255 F.3d\n\n19, 29 n.11 (1st Cir. 2001).            The second is that jury instructions\n\nmust be viewed as a whole.            See Hopkins v. Jordan Marine, Inc., 271\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n               2. Analysis\n\n               In order to make out her retaliation claim under Title\n\nVII,       Booker   had   to   show   that   \"(1)   she   engaged   in   protected\n\nactivity; (2) she suffered some materially adverse action; and (3)\n\n\n       9\n      Booker also argues that she did not object at the postcharge\nconference because the district court stated that it would hear\nonly \"[]new\" objections, and she had already objected to the\nadverse action instruction at the precharge conference. However,\nBooker's earlier objection was made to the court's tentative\ninstruction, not to the revised instruction intended to accommodate\nher concerns, and thus Booker's objection to the newly modified\ninstruction would have been new. Moreover, counsel had a duty to\nobject \"even at the risk of incurring the displeasure of the trial\ncourt.\"   Flynn, 377 F.3d at 25 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).\n\n                                         -15-\n\fthe adverse action was causally linked to her protected activity.\"\n\nDixon v. Int'l Bhd. of Police Officers, 504 F.3d 73, 81 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).    In Burlington, the Court clarified the legal standard for\n\nthe   required     showing     of    an   adverse   action   under       Title   VII's\n\nantiretaliation provision. Burlington first addressed the question\n\nof    whether    the   antiretaliation       provision   \"forbids        only    those\n\nemployer actions and resulting harms that are related to employment\n\nor the workplace.\"        548 U.S. at 61.         Recognizing that an employer\n\ncan effectively retaliate against an employee through actions \"not\n\ndirectly related to his employment or by causing him harm outside\n\nthe workplace,\" the Court held that Title VII's antiretaliation\n\nprovision, unlike the statute's substantive antidiscrimination\n\nprovision, \"is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect\n\nthe terms and conditions of employment.\"               Id. at 63-64.\n\n            The Court next addressed the question of \"how harmful an\n\nact of retaliatory discrimination must be in order to fall within\n\nthe provision's scope.\"              Id. at 61. The Court held that the\n\nantiretaliation provision covers those \"employer actions that would\n\nhave been materially adverse to a reasonable employee,\" that is,\n\nactions that are \"harmful to the point that they could well\n\ndissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of\n\ndiscrimination.\" Id. at 57.           Thus, whether an action is materially\n\nadverse    is    judged   by    an    objective     rather   than    a    subjective\n\nstandard.       Id. at 68-69.\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f                   a.    Instruction's Language Regarding Reprisals\n                         \"Intended   to  Discourage\"   Employees or\n                         Reasonably \"Perceived in that Way\"\n\n          Relying on Burlington, Booker primarily challenges the\n\nfinal clause of the adverse action instruction, \"reprisals intended\n\nto discourage other employees from complaining about unlawful\n\npractices or reprisals that might be perceived in that way by other\n\nemployees looking at them reasonably.\"\n\n          Booker    claims      that    the   first   clause     --     \"reprisals\n\nintended to discourage other employees\" -- erroneously conflated\n\nthe adverse action element of a Title VII claim, which she says\n\ndoes not look to the employer's intent, with the retaliation\n\nelement, which considers the employer's retaliatory motive.                     She\n\nconcludes that the instruction imposed a higher burden of proof on\n\nthe adverse action element by requiring her to show that her\n\nemployer's intent was to discourage other employees' complaints.\n\nBurlington,   Booker    says,    only    required     her   to   show    that   the\n\nemployer's    actions   might    dissuade     a   reasonable     employee       from\n\ncomplaining of discrimination.\n\n          While the language in this phrase of the instruction was\n\nawkward and created numerous potential issues, including some not\n\nraised by Booker,10 we cannot say that the instruction on adverse\n\n\n     10\n          Though Booker claims that this clause of the instructions\nimposed a higher burden of proof on her to show adverse action,\nthat is not necessarily the case. The clause could, for instance,\nbe read to allow a jury to find liability based on intent without\nmateriality, a standard that would lessen Booker's burden.\n\n                                       -17-\n\faction     was    error.        When    evaluating        claims     of    error    in    jury\n\ninstructions, our task is not to parse particular phrases, but to\n\nlook at the instructions as a whole in light of the relevant\n\nstandard     of       review.          Taken       together,    the       adverse     action\n\ninstructions were not so clearly divergent from the Burlington\n\nstandard as to constitute plain error.\n\n             The challenged portion of the instruction was part of a\n\nlonger sentence listing examples of materially adverse actions; it\n\nwas not the lone basis given to the jury to understand the legal\n\ndefinition of an adverse action. Whatever objection there might be\n\nto   the   challenged         phrase        of    the   \"reprisals\"       portion    of   the\n\ninstruction,          the    instruction          was   saved   by    the     alternative\n\nformulation at the end of the sentence: \"or reprisals that might be\n\nperceived        in   that    way      by    other      employees     looking       at    them\n\nreasonably.\"\n\n             Given its placement, the likely reading of the final\n\nphrase (and the meaning ascribed to it by the district court) was\n\nthat it referred to \"reprisals that might be perceived in that way\n\n[that is, as discouraging complaints about unlawful practices] by\n\nother employees looking at them reasonably.\"\n\n             That interpretation accurately captures the Burlington\n\nstandard: it conveys that the standard is an objective one, based\n\non the vantage of a reasonable employee, and that the critical\n\ninquiry is whether the reprisals might deter a reasonable employee\n\n\n                                                 -18-\n\ffrom complaining of discrimination.               That interpretation is also\n\nreinforced by the context of this phrase in relation to the rest of\n\nthe jury instructions: it immediately preceded a paragraph further\n\nexplaining to the jury that adverse actions did not include things\n\nlike \"hurt feelings\" and \"subjective disappointments\" that might\n\ndissuade     a    hyper-sensitive   employee        but    would    not   deter    a\n\nreasonable       employee.    Viewed    as    a   whole,   the     adverse   action\n\ninstruction was not plainly erroneous.               We do, though, recommend\n\nthat instructions on retaliation hew more closely to Burlington and\n\nDixon.\n\n                      b.     Instruction's Language that \"Employment\n                             Action to be Adverse Must Change the Terms\n                             and Conditions\" of Employment\n\n           Booker also contends that the adverse action instruction\n\nerroneously stated that an adverse action must \"change the terms\n\nand conditions of the plaintiff's employment.\"                     However, while\n\nBooker correctly notes that the antiretaliation provision of Title\n\nVII \"is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms\n\nand conditions of employment,\" Burlington, 548 U.S. at 64, the\n\ndistrict court was entitled to tailor its instruction to the\n\nevidence presented at trial.           Each of the allegedly retaliatory\n\nacts against Booker, including written warnings, personal time\n\nallocation,       modifications   in    payroll      procedures,      changes     or\n\nreductions in job duties, and suspension without pay, were related\n\nto her employment and occurred at the workplace.                 Cf. Burlington,\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\f548 U.S. at 63-64 (citing examples of actionable retaliation\n\ncausing harm \"outside the workplace,\" including FBI's refusal to\n\ninvestigate death threats against employee and employer's filing of\n\nfalse criminal charges against former employee).          On the facts of\n\nthis   case,   the   court   properly    confined   its   instruction   to\n\nworkplace-related actions.       Therefore, we cannot say that this\n\nportion of the instruction was erroneous.\n\nB. Spoliation Jury Instruction\n\n           Booker next contends that the court erred in refusing to\n\ninstruct the jurors that they could draw an adverse inference if\n\nthey found that defendants destroyed documents relevant to Booker's\n\nclaims.\n\n           1. Evidence and Requested Instruction on Spoliation\n\n           At trial, Booker cross-examined three hospital employees\n\nabout their deletion of email correspondence concerning Booker.\n\nWong, who became Booker's immediate supervisor in the fall of 2004,\n\ntestified that shortly after he began working at the hospital, he\n\nwas informed that Booker had filed an administrative complaint\n\nagainst the hospital and that it was possible he could become a\n\ndefendant, although he did not know the subject matter of her\n\nclaims.   Wong further testified that he regularly deleted all of\n\nthe emails in his \"sent\" and \"deleted\" email folders every thirty\n\ndays, and did not do anything in particular to preserve emails\n\nconcerning Booker. Paul Romary, the hospital's executive director,\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\ftestified that he received a copy of Booker's December 2003 letter\n\nof complaint.     He explained that he received a hundred emails a\n\nday, some of which he deleted, and made no special effort to\n\npreserve his emails concerning Booker.         Barbara McLaughlin, an\n\nexecutive vice president of the hospital and Wong's supervisor\n\nbeginning in December 2005, testified that she never deleted any\n\nemails concerning Booker.\n\n          Prior    to   trial,   Booker   submitted   a   proposed   jury\n\ninstruction on the spoliation of evidence:\n\n          If the evidence indicates that a party has\n          destroyed records relevant to a pending\n          lawsuit or that may be relevant to a lawsuit\n          that could arise in the future, you may\n          reasonably infer that the party probably did\n          so because the records would harm its case.\n          The non-destroying party need not have offered\n          direct evidence of a cover-up for you to infer\n          that the party who destroyed evidence did so\n          because the records were unfavorable to its\n          position or would harm its case.\n\nThe court refused to give the requested instruction, and Booker\n\nrecorded her objection at the precharge conference.        In its order\n\ndenying Booker's motion for a new trial, the court again rejected\n\nBooker's claim that the jury should have been given the spoliation\n\ninstruction.    The court reasoned that \"because Booker did not\n\npresent any evidence at trial that Wong or defendants engaged in\n\nthe deliberate spo[li]ation of evidence, no instruction on an\n\nadverse inference was merited.     Indeed, such an instruction would\n\nhave been misleading and prejudicial to defendants.\"\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\f          2. Legal Framework on Spoliation\n\n          Where a proper evidentiary foundation has been laid, \"a\n\ntrier of fact may (but need not) infer from a party's obliteration\n\nof a document relevant to a litigated issue that the contents of\n\nthe document were unfavorable to that party.\"    Testa v. Wal-Mart\n\nStores, Inc., 144 F.3d 173, 177 (1st Cir. 1998); see also Nation-\n\nWide Check Corp., Inc. v. Forest Hills Distribs., Inc., 692 F.2d\n\n214, 217-218 (1st Cir. 1982) (Breyer, J.).   This adverse inference\n\nis based in part on the commonsense observation that a party who\n\n\"destroys a document (or permits it to be destroyed) when facing\n\nlitigation, knowing the document's relevancy to issues in the case,\n\nmay well do so out of a sense that the document's contents hurt his\n\nposition.\"   Testa, 144 F.3d at 177; accord Nation-Wide Check, 692\n\nF.2d at 218.    The inference is also based on prophylactic and\n\npunitive rationales: it serves to deter litigants from destroying\n\nrelevant evidence prior to trial and to penalize a party whose\n\nmisconduct creates the risk of an erroneous judgment.   Nation-Wide\n\nCheck, 692 F.2d at 218.\n\n          Before an adverse inference can arise, the sponsor of the\n\ninference must lay an evidentiary foundation, proffering evidence\n\nsufficient to show that the party who destroyed the document \"knew\n\nof (a) the claim (that is, the litigation or the potential for\n\nlitigation), and (b) the document's potential relevance to that\n\nclaim.\"   Testa, 144 F.3d at 177; see also id. at 178 (noting that\n\n\n                               -22-\n\fadequate foundation depends upon evidence of \"institutional notice\n\n-- the aggregate knowledge possessed by a party and its agents,\n\nservants   and   employees\").   A   spoliation   instruction   is   not\n\nwarranted absent this threshold showing, because the trier of fact\n\nwould have no basis for inferring that the destruction of documents\n\nstemmed from the party's consciousness that the documents would\n\ndamage his case.\n\n           A \"trial court's decision to give or refuse an adverse\n\ninference instruction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\"\n\nGilbert v. Cosco, 989 F.2d 399, 406 (10th Cir. 1993); see also\n\nUnited States v. St. Michael's Credit Union, 880 F.2d 579, 597 (1st\n\nCir. 1989) (stating that trial court's decision to give or refuse\n\nmissing witness instruction is committed to its sound discretion).\n\n           3. Analysis\n\n           As an initial matter, Booker argues that the district\n\ncourt applied the wrong legal standard when it stated that because\n\nthere was no evidence presented at trial that \"Wong or defendants\n\nengaged in the deliberate spo[li]ation of evidence, no instruction\n\non an adverse inference was merited.\"11   However, we understand the\n\n\n     11\n        We note that at the earlier precharge conference, in\nresponse to Booker's objection to its refusal to give the\nspoliation instruction, the court stated: \"I think the law is clear\nthat I don't have to instruct on that.      I just have to permit\nargument if there is a basis for it from the evidence.\" On appeal,\nthe parties do not challenge the propriety of the court's\nsuggestion that Booker could argue for an adverse inference to the\njury.   Therefore, we take no position on whether a court can\nproperly decide that there is sufficient evidence to permit the\n\n                                -23-\n\fdistrict court's reference to \"deliberate\" spoliation as simply a\n\nshorthand for the evidentiary foundation required to support an\n\nadverse inference.   In other words, the district court concluded\n\nthat Booker failed to make the required threshold showing that\n\ndefendants destroyed emails (or permitted their destruction) while\n\non notice of Booker's claims and the emails' potential relevance to\n\nthose   claims.   Therefore,   the   jury   would   have   no   basis   for\n\ninferring that defendants destroyed the emails \"out of a sense that\n\nthe document's contents hurt [defendants'] position,\" and so a\n\nspoliation instruction was not warranted.      Testa, 144 F.3d at 177;\n\nsee also Nation-Wide Check, 692 F.2d at 219.\n\n           Booker further contends that the court erred in finding\n\nthat she failed to lay an adequate foundation for a spoliation\n\ninstruction. She contends that she produced sufficient evidence at\n\ntrial to prove that at the time defendants deleted the emails (or\n\npermitted their destruction), they had knowledge both of her claims\n\nagainst them and of the emails' potential relevance to those\n\nclaims.\n\n           We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin concluding that the evidence at trial was insufficient to merit\n\na spoliation instruction.      Booker presented no evidence that\n\n\nparties to argue for an adverse inference to the jury, while at the\nsame time declining to give a spoliation instruction.       In this\ncase, our focus is on whether the court correctly concluded that\nthe evidence at trial was insufficient to support a spoliation jury\ninstruction.\n\n                                -24-\n\fMcLaughlin deleted any emails concerning her, whether potentially\n\nrelevant or not.     Indeed, McLaughlin testified repeatedly that\n\nalthough she sometimes deleted emails, she never deleted any emails\n\nconcerning Booker.    Booker did elicit testimony from Wong and\n\nRomary that they regularly deleted their emails and may have\n\ndeleted some concerning her.   However, she proffered no evidence\n\nthat any of those emails were even potentially relevant to her\n\nclaims in this case, or that defendants knew of their potential\n\nrelevance.   Although permitted to cross-examine Wong and Romary\n\nabout their deletion of emails, Booker did not question either\n\nwitness about the content of the deleted emails or about whether\n\nthe emails were relevant to her claims.\n\n          Furthermore, unlike many spoliation cases, this is not a\n\ncase in which a document's potential relevance to the plaintiff's\n\nclaims is apparent from the nature of the missing document itself.\n\nSee, e.g., Testa, 144 F.3d at 177 (finding notice of potential\n\nrelevance where company destroyed purchase order for delivery on\n\ndate of plaintiff's injury, and company's \"defense from the start\n\nwas anchored on the premise that it had no reason to anticipate any\n\ndeliveries on the day in question\"); Blinzler v. Marriot Int'l,\n\nInc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1158-59 (finding notice of potential relevance\n\nwhere hotel destroyed log of outgoing phone calls from day of hotel\n\nguest's death, and hotel knew of guest's death and of plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                               -25-\n\fspouse's \"persistent attempts\" to discover when the hotel placed\n\nthe call for emergency aid).\n\n            In sum, Booker produced evidence showing merely that two\n\nhospital   employees,   Wong      and    Romary,    routinely   deleted   their\n\nemails, some of which may have concerned her.                 She produced no\n\nevidence that defendants destroyed emails with knowledge that the\n\nemails were potentially relevant to her claims in this case.\n\nBecause    Booker   failed   to    establish       the   required   evidentiary\n\nfoundation for an adverse inference, the court properly concluded\n\nthat a spoliation instruction was not warranted.12\n\n                                        III.\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     12\n        Booker also notes that Wong testified that he discarded a\nUnited States Coast Guard Manual, which, she contends, was relevant\nto her claims because he relied on it for his decision to\nreallocate police dispatching duties at the hospital. However, the\nmanual was not unique and, to the extent it was relevant, Booker\ncould have obtained a copy of the publication from the Coast Guard.\nThe court did not abuse its discretion in not permitting an adverse\ninference based on the discarded manual.\n\n                                        -26-\n\f",

Laws ch. 151B, § 4(4), and tortious interference with contractual employment relations. The court then denied Booker's post-trial motions.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Booker first contends that the court's jury instruction on the meaning of a \"materially adverse action\" misstated the legal standard governing her retaliation claim. Although we conclude that the adverse action instruction was problematic, we reject that claim of error.</p>\n<p>Booker also argues that the court erroneously refused to instruct the jury on the doctrine of spoliation. Booker requested an instruction that the jury could draw an adverse inference based on the deletion of emails concerning Booker by certain hospital employees. We conclude that Booker failed to lay a proper evidentiary foundation for a spoliation instruction and therefore the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give it. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Booker, an African-American woman, began working at the Lemuel Shattuck Hospital (the hospital) as a telephone operator in the late 1980s. In 2001, she was promoted to \"Communications Dispatcher II.\" Booker's responsibilities in her new position included dispatching the hospital's campus police officers and supervising the telephone operators, or \"Communication Dispatcher I's,\" who staffed the communications department. The communications department performed functions such as screening and receiving incoming calls, transferring calls to other departments, receiving emergency calls from within the hospital, assisting with dispatching, and greeting visitors.</p>\n<p>On September 9, 2003, Booker met with Shawn McMullen, then her immediate supervisor, and Edward Nicosia, then the hospital's Deputy Director of Facilities Management,<sup>[1]</sup> to express concern that she was receiving telephone calls from her staff while she was off duty. Nicosia explained that under her collective bargaining agreement she was entitled to \"call-back pay\" for work-related calls received at home. Later that day, Nicosia and McMullen circulated a memorandum to Booker's staff discouraging them from calling <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> their supervisor at home except in emergency situations, and copied Booker.</p>\n<p>Several months later, on December 15, 2003, Booker hand-delivered a letter to Nicosia complaining that the hospital had discriminated against her based on race by failing to compensate her for off-duty calls. In the letter, Booker asserted that she was owed call-back pay for seventy-five calls she had received at home over the past two years, and that McMullen, who is white, was receiving off-duty calls from Booker's staff that should have gone to her. She stated that the sole reason for this unequal treatment was race and that her letter represented \"a relatively whispering salvo in what could become a vigorous public challenge of rampant institutional racism at the Hospital.\"</p>\n<p>Later that same day, Booker confronted McMullen in the campus police department, located in the hospital's main lobby. In a raised voice, Booker asked McMullen why members of her staff were calling him after hours instead of her and whether the hospital had a policy of only paying white supervisors for off-duty calls. She asserted that this was racism and she would speak with a lawyer. In early January 2004, Nicosia and McMullen had a meeting with Booker to discuss the December 15 incident. Booker apologized for confronting McMullen in such a public setting, but did not retract her complaints. Ultimately, in late January, she was issued a written warning for her behavior. On February 6, 2004, Booker filed the first of several administrative complaints with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging race discrimination and retaliation.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In the months that followed Booker's December 15 letter of complaint, Nicosia took several actions related to payroll and timekeeping procedures that displeased Booker. In January 2004, Nicosia removed the communications logbook from Booker's desk and replaced it with a new logbook. Members of the communications department used the log to record information such as shift assignments, staff absences, and phone calls to staff at home, and the logbook removed by Nicosia contained entries related to Booker's claim for call-back pay. The following month, Booker and Nicosia had a disagreement about allocation of personal time. Noticing that Booker had missed twelve hours of work but had not reported the absences on her timesheet, Nicosia deducted twelve hours of her personal time. When Booker discovered this deduction, she informed Nicosia that she preferred to use a combination of sick time, vacation time, and leave without pay to cover the time off. Although Nicosia asked Booker to make this correction by submitting a payroll adjustment form, she instead called the payroll department and had them make the change. After discovering that Booker made the payroll change without the appropriate paperwork, Nicosia submitted a payroll adjustment form again designating Booker's absences as personal time. Booker complained, but Nicosia refused to have her personal time returned.</p>\n<p>Finally, in February 2005, Nicosia learned that Booker was logging her time in the communications log and reviewing her own timesheets as well as those of her staff. Nicosia directed Human Resources to make changes so that Booker was required to enter her time in the so-called steward's log and submit her weekly time-sheets <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> to her immediate supervisor for review.</p>\n<p>Changes were also made to Booker's job responsibilities over the 2004-2005 period. In the fall of 2004, Richard Wong joined the hospital as the director of safety and security and replaced McMullen as Booker's immediate supervisor. Sometime thereafter, Wong hired additional police officers and informed Booker that whenever at least five officers were on duty, an officer would perform dispatching duties. Booker continued to fill in as a dispatcher on an as-needed basis, around four or five times per month, but it was no longer a regular part of her job duties. Wong also requested that Booker get trained to perform mailroom duties, which consisted of sorting incoming mail in the morning and metering outgoing mail in the afternoon, so that she could cover the mailroom on occasion. Other employees, including Wong, covered the mailroom when the regular mailroom clerk was out, and the job description for Booker's position, Communications Dispatcher II, listed sorting and delivering mail as one of her job responsibilities. However, Booker refused the mailroom training and resisted performing mailroom duties, viewing them as less prestigious than her other duties. As a result, she rarely covered the mailroom, filling in there for the first time on December 30, 2005.</p>\n<p>Finally, in June 2005, Booker was suspended for one day without pay following a confrontation with a campus police officer. The officer, hurrying to get to an assigned location at the hospital on time, exchanged his radio for the radio on Booker's desk, which had a belt clip. Raising her voice, she chastised him for taking her radio and called him derogatory names. People passing through the busy hospital lobby observed the incident.</p>\n<p>In October 2005, Booker filed this action in federal district court against the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), and four individual defendants, including Nicosia.<sup>[3]</sup> Booker alleged, inter alia, that defendants retaliated against her for complaining about discriminatory withholding of callback pay and for filing complaints with the MCAD,<sup>[4]</sup> and that the individual defendants intentionally interfered with her contractual employment relationships. Following pretrial dispositions not at issue in this appeal,<sup>[5]</sup> Booker proceeded to trial on her retaliation claims against DPH, EOHHS and Nicosia (hereafter, defendants), and her tortious interference claim against Nicosia.</p>\n<p>At trial, the court instructed the jury as to the actions that Booker maintained were retaliatory:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> [T]he written warning issued in January of 2004; the removal of the communications logbook from the desk where she worked; the February 2004 incident involving Mr. Nicosia's reduction of her personal time for an unreported absence; the requirement that she sign for her time on the stewards' log rather than the communication dispatchers' log; the reduction in her police dispatching duties; her assignment to mailroom duties and training, and her one-day suspension in June of 2005.</blockquote>\n<p>After a five-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants on all claims. The district court denied Booker's post-judgment motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial. On appeal, Booker contends, as she did in her motion for a new trial, that (1) the district court improperly instructed the jury on the required showing of a materially adverse action for purposes of her retaliation claim, and (2) the court erred in refusing to give a spoliation jury instruction. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Retaliation Jury Instruction</h2>\n<p>At trial, the district court instructed the jury on the requisite showing of a materially adverse action under Title VII:</p>\n<blockquote>Under federal and state law, Ms. Booker must prove ... by a preponderance of the evidence ... that the desire to retaliate because of [her complaints of discrimination] was a motivating and determinative factor in any decision to alter Ms. Booker's terms and conditions of employment in a materially adverse manner....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>An employment action <i>to be adverse must materially change the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment.</i> Examples the law gives include demotions, disadvantageous transfers or assignments, the loss of promotions, unwarranted negative evaluations, toleration of harassing conduct by co-employees, <i>and reprisals intended to discourage other employees from complaining about unlawful practices or reprisals that might be perceived in that way by other employees looking at them reasonably.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Booker contends on appeal that this instruction misstated the legal standard applicable to her retaliation claim as set forth in <i>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White,</i> 548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). First, she contends that the instruction erroneously required a showing that an adverse action affect the terms and conditions of her employment. Second, she argues that the final phrase in the exemplary list of adverse actions, beginning with \"and reprisals,\" improperly required her to demonstrate that the reprisals be intended to discourage, or reasonably be perceived as intended to discourage, employee complaints.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>A party who objects to an instruction must \"stat[e] distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c)(1). Under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> the procedure outlined in Rule 51, before the trial court charges the jury it must inform the parties of its proposed instructions and receive any objections. Fed. R.Civ.P. 51(b); <i>Surprenant v. Rivas,</i> 424 F.3d 5, 15 (1st Cir.2005). An objection made at that time \"preserves <i>the underlying issue</i> for appeal.\" <i>Surprenant,</i> 424 F.3d at 15 (emphasis added) (citing Fed. R.Civ.P. 51(c)(2)(A)). If, however, a party is \"not informed of an instruction or action on a request\" during the precharge conference, the party may object \"promptly after learning that the instruction or request will be, or has been, given or refused.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c)(2)(B). The requirements of Rule 51 \"are not to be taken lightly\" and \"there is a high price to be paid for noncompliance.\" <i>DeCaro v. Hasbro, Inc.,</i> 580 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir.2009). Failure to comply with the rule ordinarily results in forfeiture of \"the objection to which the failure relates,\" and we review forfeited objections only for plain error. <i>Id.</i> (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(d)(2)). Our strict enforcement of the object-or-forfeit rule serves \"to compel litigants to afford the trial court an opportunity to cure [a] defective instruction and to prevent the litigants from ensuring a new trial in the event of an adverse verdict by covertly relying on the error.\" <i>Flynn v. AK Peters, Ltd.,</i> 377 F.3d 13, 25 (1st Cir.2004) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>In this case, the court discussed its tentative jury instructions with the parties at a sidebar conference held before the jury was charged.<sup>[7]</sup> The court stated that it planned to add, at the end of the adverse action instruction, the phrase \"Reprisals intended to discourage other employees from complaining about unlawful practices.\" Booker's counsel objected, stating:</p>\n<blockquote>I am concerned that, as I heard the instruction, that the employer intended to deter other employees, I don't think it's necessary that he intended to deter, so long as it was reasonably foreseeable that it would deter. In other words, I don't believe there is an intention requirement as to the deterrence. It's only that it be a deterrent. He must intend to retaliate but the effect must, in effect, deter a reasonable employee, not that he intended to deter others....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The <i>Burlington</i> Court, talked about and used language, \"an adverse action consists of any action that may dissuade a reason[able] employee from engaging in protected activity.\"</blockquote>\n<p>In response, the court noted that it \"might add, `Or reasonably would have been perceived by the employe[e],' but I just don't want to turn this into a strict-liability tort.\" Booker's counsel did not voice any further objection. The court gave the modified instruction to the jury, stating that examples of adverse actions include \"reprisals intended to discourage other employees from complaining about unlawful practices <i>or reprisals that might be perceived in that way by other employees looking at them reasonably</i>.\" (Emphasis added.) The court held a sidebar conference after the charge, inviting any \"[]new\" objections, but Booker's counsel raised no objection to the instruction as given.</p>\n<p>As this account makes clear, Booker never objected in the district court on the first ground she presses on appealthat the instruction improperly stated that an adverse action must \"materially change the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment.\" That objection is therefore forfeited. <i>See </i><i>Boston Gas Co. v. Century Indem. Co.,</i> 529 F.3d 8, 19 (1st Cir.2008) (holding that objection was forfeited where party made an objection to court's proposed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> instruction, but on grounds unrelated to the aspect it criticized on appeal).</p>\n<p>Booker did object at the precharge conference on the ground that the tentative instruction improperly required that a materially adverse action be intended to discourage employee complaints. However, the court then proposed adding instructional language to address Booker's concern, and Booker did not object after being apprised of the court's proposed modification or after hearing the modified instruction given to the jury. The \"purpose of a sidebar objection is to inform the judge exactly what he got wrong and what he should do to remedy the incipient harm.\" <i>DeCaro,</i> 580 F.3d at 61. By failing to object to the modified instruction either before or after the charge, Booker failed to inform the court that she believed the instruction was still problematic, specify the grounds for her objection, or give the court an opportunity to correct any error. Therefore, this objection is also forfeited. <i>See, e.g., Kirk v. Reed Tool Co.,</i> 247 Fed. Appx. 485, 486 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (unpublished) (\"[W]hile [plaintiff] may have objected to the original jury charge, he did <i>not</i> object to the supplemental charge. Therefore, our review is only for plain error.\"); <i>Cooney v. Booth,</i> 28 Fed. Appx. 148, 151 (3d Cir.2002) (unpublished) (reviewing instruction for plain error because \"absent a specific objection following the actual charge, [the court] had no way of knowing that its efforts to accommodate the general objection made at the [precharge] conference had not been wholly successful\").<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Noting that Rule 51 was amended effective December 1, 2003, Booker argues that her objections were properly preserved under the amended rule. We have acknowledged that the 2003 amendments to Rule 51 made changes to the procedure for lodging objections. Under the former version of the rule, objections were not preserved unless they were \"taken at sidebar <i>after</i> the trial judge had charged the jury.\" <i>Surprenant,</i> 424 F.3d at 15 n. 3 (emphasis added). Thus, even if a party properly objected to a proposed instruction prior to the jury charge and the court then gave the challenged instruction, that objection was forfeited unless the party renewed the objection after the jury charge. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>McGrath v. Spirito,</i> 733 F.2d 967, 968-69 (1st Cir.1984). We have also noted that the 2003 amendments \"were designed in part to ease the burden on parties in preserving their objections to instructions where the district court had already made a definitive ruling, on the record, rejecting a request for a particular instruction.\" <i>Colón-Millín v. Sears Roebuck De Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> 455 F.3d 30, 40 n. 7 (1st Cir. 2006). However, the 2003 amendments do not assist Booker here. Nothing in the amended rule suggests that a party may preserve a claim of error by objecting to a tentative instruction at the precharge conference, but then failing to object after the instruction is modified to accommodate the initial objection.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> Therefore, we review the legal standards stated in the jury instructions only for plain error. In doing so, we bear two precepts in mind. The first is that the district court has wide discretion over the particular words it chooses to convey those standards. <i>See </i><i>Johnson v. Spencer Press of Me., Inc.,</i> 364 F.3d 368, 378 (1st Cir. 2004); <i>Interstate Litho Corp. v. Brown,</i> 255 F.3d 19, 29 n. 11 (1st Cir.2001). The second is that jury instructions must be viewed as a whole. <i>See </i><i>Hopkins v. Jordan Marine, Inc.,</i> 271 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Analysis</h2>\n<p>In order to make out her retaliation claim under Title VII, Booker had to show that \"(1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) she suffered some materially adverse action; and (3) the adverse action was causally linked to her protected activity.\" <i>Dixon v. Int'l Bhd. of Police Officers,</i> 504 F.3d 73, 81 (1st Cir.2007). In <i>Burlington,</i> the Court clarified the legal standard for the required showing of an adverse action under Title VII's antiretaliation provision. <i>Burlington</i> first addressed the question of whether the antiretaliation provision \"forbids only those employer actions and resulting harms that are related to employment or the workplace.\" 548 U.S. at 61, 126 S.Ct. 2405. Recognizing that an employer can effectively retaliate against an employee through actions \"not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm <i>outside</i> the workplace,\" the Court held that Title VII's antiretaliation provision, unlike the statute's substantive antidiscrimination provision, \"is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 63-64, 126 S.Ct. 2405.</p>\n<p>The Court next addressed the question of \"how harmful an act of retaliatory discrimination must be in order to fall within the provision's scope.\" <i>Id.</i> at 61, 126 S.Ct. 2405. The Court held that the antiretaliation provision covers those \"employer actions that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee,\" that is, actions that are \"harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 57, 126 S.Ct. 2405. Thus, whether an action is materially adverse is judged by an objective rather than a subjective standard. <i>Id.</i> at 68-69, 126 S.Ct. 2405.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Instruction's Language Regarding Reprisals \"Intended to Discourage\" Employees or Reasonably \"Perceived in that Way\"</h2>\n<p>Relying on <i>Burlington,</i> Booker primarily challenges the final clause of the adverse action instruction, \"reprisals intended to discourage other employees from complaining about unlawful practices or reprisals that might be perceived in that way by other employees looking at them reasonably.\"</p>\n<p>Booker claims that the first clause \"reprisals intended to discourage other employees\"erroneously conflated the adverse action element of a Title VII claim, which she says does not look to the employer's intent, with the retaliation element, which considers the employer's retaliatory motive. She concludes that the instruction imposed a higher burden of proof on the adverse action element by requiring her to show that her employer's intent was to discourage other employees' complaints. <i>Burlington,</i> Booker says, only required her to show that the employer's actions might dissuade a reasonable employee from complaining of discrimination.</p>\n<p>While the language in this phrase of the instruction was awkward and created numerous potential issues, including <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> some not raised by Booker,<sup>[10]</sup> we cannot say that the instruction on adverse action was error. When evaluating claims of error in jury instructions, our task is not to parse particular phrases, but to look at the instructions as a whole in light of the relevant standard of review. Taken together, the adverse action instructions were not so clearly divergent from the <i>Burlington</i> standard as to constitute plain error.</p>\n<p>The challenged portion of the instruction was part of a longer sentence listing examples of materially adverse actions; it was not the lone basis given to the jury to understand the legal definition of an adverse action. Whatever objection there might be to the challenged phrase of the \"reprisals\" portion of the instruction, the instruction was saved by the alternative formulation at the end of the sentence: \"or reprisals that might be perceived in that way by other employees looking at them reasonably.\"</p>\n<p>Given its placement, the likely reading of the final phrase (and the meaning ascribed to it by the district court) was that it referred to \"reprisals that might be perceived in that way [that is, <i>as discouraging complaints</i> about unlawful practices] by other employees looking at them reasonably.\"</p>\n<p>That interpretation accurately captures the <i>Burlington</i> standard: it conveys that the standard is an objective one, based on the vantage of a reasonable employee, and that the critical inquiry is whether the reprisals might deter a reasonable employee from complaining of discrimination. That interpretation is also reinforced by the context of this phrase in relation to the rest of the jury instructions: it immediately preceded a paragraph further explaining to the jury that adverse actions did not include things like \"hurt feelings\" and \"subjective disappointments\" that might dissuade a hyper-sensitive employee but would not deter a reasonable employee. Viewed as a whole, the adverse action instruction was not plainly erroneous. We do, though, recommend that instructions on retaliation hew more closely to <i>Burlington</i> and <i>Dixon.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Instruction's Language that \"Employment Action to be Adverse Must Change the Terms and Conditions\" of Employment</h2>\n<p>Booker also contends that the adverse action instruction erroneously stated that an adverse action must \"change the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment.\" However, while Booker correctly notes that the antiretaliation provision of Title VII \"is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment,\" <i>Burlington,</i> 548 U.S. at 64, 126 S.Ct. 2405, the district court was entitled to tailor its instruction to the evidence presented at trial. Each of the allegedly retaliatory acts against Booker, including written warnings, personal time allocation, modifications in payroll procedures, changes or reductions in job duties, and suspension without pay, were related to her employment and occurred at the workplace. <i>Cf. </i><i>Burlington,</i> 548 U.S. at 63-64, 126 S.Ct. 2405 (citing examples of actionable retaliation causing harm \"<i>outside</i> the workplace,\" including FBI's refusal to investigate death threats against employee and employer's filing of false criminal charges against former employee). On the facts of this case, the court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> properly confined its instruction to workplace-related actions. Therefore, we cannot say that this portion of the instruction was erroneous.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Spoliation Jury Instruction</h2>\n<p>Booker next contends that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jurors that they could draw an adverse inference if they found that defendants destroyed documents relevant to Booker's claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Evidence and Requested Instruction on Spoliation</h2>\n<p>At trial, Booker cross-examined three hospital employees about their deletion of email correspondence concerning Booker. Wong, who became Booker's immediate supervisor in the fall of 2004, testified that shortly after he began working at the hospital, he was informed that Booker had filed an administrative complaint against the hospital and that it was possible he could become a defendant, although he did not know the subject matter of her claims. Wong further testified that he regularly deleted all of the emails in his \"sent\" and \"deleted\" email folders every thirty days, and did not do anything in particular to preserve emails concerning Booker. Paul Romary, the hospital's executive director, testified that he received a copy of Booker's December 2003 letter of complaint. He explained that he received a hundred emails a day, some of which he deleted, and made no special effort to preserve his emails concerning Booker. Barbara McLaughlin, an executive vice president of the hospital and Wong's supervisor beginning in December 2005, testified that she never deleted any emails concerning Booker.</p>\n<p>Prior to trial, Booker submitted a proposed jury instruction on the spoliation of evidence:</p>\n<blockquote>If the evidence indicates that a party has destroyed records relevant to a pending lawsuit or that may be relevant to a lawsuit that could arise in the future, you may reasonably infer that the party probably did so because the records would harm its case. The non-destroying party need not have offered direct evidence of a cover-up for you to infer that the party who destroyed evidence did so because the records were unfavorable to its position or would harm its case.</blockquote>\n<p>The court refused to give the requested instruction, and Booker recorded her objection at the precharge conference. In its order denying Booker's motion for a new trial, the court again rejected Booker's claim that the jury should have been given the spoliation instruction. The court reasoned that \"because Booker did not present any evidence at trial that Wong or defendants engaged in the deliberate spo[li]ation of evidence, no instruction on an adverse inference was merited. Indeed, such an instruction would have been misleading and prejudicial to defendants.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Legal Framework on Spoliation</h2>\n<p>Where a proper evidentiary foundation has been laid, \"a trier of fact may (but need not) infer from a party's obliteration of a document relevant to a litigated issue that the contents of the document were unfavorable to that party.\" <i>Testa v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> 144 F.3d 173, 177 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also </i><i>Nation-Wide Check Corp., Inc. v. Forest Hills Distribs., Inc.,</i> 692 F.2d 214, 217-218 (1st Cir.1982) (Breyer, J.). This adverse inference is based in part on the commonsense observation that a party who \"destroys a document (or permits it to be destroyed) when facing litigation, knowing the document's relevancy to issues in the case, may well do so out of a sense that the document's contents hurt his position.\" <i>Testa,</i> 144 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> F.3d at 177; <i>accord </i><i>Nation-Wide Check,</i> 692 F.2d at 218. The inference is also based on prophylactic and punitive rationales: it serves to deter litigants from destroying relevant evidence prior to trial and to penalize a party whose misconduct creates the risk of an erroneous judgment. <i>Nation-Wide Check,</i> 692 F.2d at 218.</p>\n<p>Before an adverse inference can arise, the sponsor of the inference must lay an evidentiary foundation, proffering evidence sufficient to show that the party who destroyed the document \"knew of (a) the claim (that is, the litigation or the potential for litigation), and (b) the document's potential relevance to that claim.\" <i>Testa,</i> 144 F.3d at 177; <i>see also id.</i> at 178 (noting that adequate foundation depends upon evidence of \"institutional noticethe aggregate knowledge possessed by a party and its agents, servants and employees\"). A spoliation instruction is not warranted absent this threshold showing, because the trier of fact would have no basis for inferring that the destruction of documents stemmed from the party's consciousness that the documents would damage his case.</p>\n<p>A \"trial court's decision to give or refuse an adverse inference instruction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Gilbert v. Cosco,</i> 989 F.2d 399, 406 (10th Cir.1993); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. St. Michael's Credit Union,</i> 880 F.2d 579, 597 (1st Cir.1989) (stating that trial court's decision to give or refuse missing witness instruction is committed to its sound discretion).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Analysis</h2>\n<p>As an initial matter, Booker argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard when it stated that because there was no evidence presented at trial that \"Wong or defendants engaged in the deliberate spo[li]ation of evidence, no instruction on an adverse inference was merited.\"<sup>[11]</sup> However, we understand the district court's reference to \"deliberate\" spoliation as simply a shorthand for the evidentiary foundation required to support an adverse inference. In other words, the district court concluded that Booker failed to make the required threshold showing that defendants destroyed emails (or permitted their destruction) while on notice of Booker's claims and the emails' potential relevance to those claims. Therefore, the jury would have no basis for inferring that defendants destroyed the emails \"out of a sense that the document's contents hurt [defendants'] position,\" and so a spoliation instruction was not warranted. <i>Testa,</i> 144 F.3d at 177; <i>see also </i><i>Nation-Wide Check,</i> 692 F.2d at 219.</p>\n<p>Booker further contends that the court erred in finding that she failed to lay an adequate foundation for a spoliation instruction. She contends that she produced sufficient evidence at trial to prove that at the time defendants deleted the emails (or permitted their destruction), they had knowledge both of her claims against them and of the emails' potential relevance to those claims.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the evidence at trial was insufficient to merit a spoliation instruction. Booker presented no evidence that McLaughlin deleted any emails concerning her, whether potentially relevant or not. Indeed, McLaughlin testified repeatedly that although she sometimes deleted emails, she never deleted any emails concerning Booker. Booker did elicit testimony from Wong and Romary that they regularly deleted their emails and may have deleted some concerning her. However, she proffered no evidence that any of those emails were even potentially relevant <i>to her claims in this case,</i> or that defendants knew of their potential relevance. Although permitted to cross-examine Wong and Romary about their deletion of emails, Booker did not question either witness about the content of the deleted emails or about whether the emails were relevant to her claims.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, unlike many spoliation cases, this is not a case in which a document's potential relevance to the plaintiff's claims is apparent from the nature of the missing document itself. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Testa,</i> 144 F.3d at 177 (finding notice of potential relevance where company destroyed purchase order for delivery on date of plaintiff's injury, and company's \"defense from the start was anchored on the premise that it had no reason to anticipate any deliveries on the day in question\"); <i>Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l, Inc.,</i> 81 F.3d 1148, 1158-59 (1st Cir.1996) (finding notice of potential relevance where hotel destroyed log of outgoing phone calls from day of hotel guest's death, and hotel knew of guest's death and of plaintiff spouse's \"persistent attempts\" to discover when the hotel placed the call for emergency aid).</p>\n<p>In sum, Booker produced evidence showing merely that two hospital employees, Wong and Romary, routinely deleted their emails, some of which may have concerned her. She produced no evidence that defendants destroyed emails with knowledge that the emails were potentially relevant to her claims in this case. Because Booker failed to establish the required evidentiary foundation for an adverse inference, the court properly concluded that a spoliation instruction was not warranted.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Later in 2003, Nicosia became the Acting Director of Facilities, and sometime in the end of 2004 or beginning of 2005, he became the Director of Facilities.</p>\n<p>[2]  Booker filed a second administrative complaint for retaliation in May 2005 and a third administrative complaint sometime thereafter.</p>\n<p>[3]  The individual defendants named in the complaint were Nicosia, McMullen, the hospital's Executive Director Paul Romary, and Director of Labor Relations Jennifer Foley.</p>\n<p>[4]  Although Booker brought her retaliation claims under both state and federal law, the parties have not suggested that the state and federal antiretaliation provisions differ in any way material to the issues on appeal. Therefore, we focus our analysis on the standards for retaliation under Title VII and do not separately analyze the analogous retaliation provision under state law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 4(4).</p>\n<p>[5]  The court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on Booker's claims for racial discrimination, interference with the right to be free from discrimination, and aiding, abetting, inciting or compelling discrimination. Booker voluntarily dismissed her claims for libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress against all defendants, and dismissed her tortious interference claim against all defendants except Nicosia. Finally, the court dismissed all remaining claims against Romary, Foley and McMullen.</p>\n<p>[6]  The next paragraph of the instructions described what were not adverse actions, though this portion of the instruction is not at issue:\n</p>\n<p>Adverse job actions do not include hurt feelings, subjective disappointments, disillusionment over an employer's actions, or expected losses of job function or responsibilities because of a business or corporate reorganization. It also does not [in]clude everyday workplace banter or teasing, which all of us are familiar with.</p>\n<p>[7]  The court's tentative instructions apparently were not made part of the record.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although the cited opinions are unpublished, we rely on them for their persuasive value.</p>\n<p>[9]  Booker also argues that she did not object at the postcharge conference because the district court stated that it would hear only \"[]new\" objections, and she had already objected to the adverse action instruction at the precharge conference. However, Booker's earlier objection was made to the court's tentative instruction, not to the revised instruction intended to accommodate her concerns, and thus Booker's objection to the newly modified instruction would have been new. Moreover, counsel had a duty to object \"even at the risk of incurring the displeasure of the trial court.\" <i>Flynn,</i> 377 F.3d at 25 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>[10]  Though Booker claims that this clause of the instructions imposed a higher burden of proof on her to show adverse action, that is not necessarily the case. The clause could, for instance, be read to allow a jury to find liability based on intent without materiality, a standard that would lessen Booker's burden.</p>\n<p>[11]  We note that at the earlier precharge conference, in response to Booker's objection to its refusal to give the spoliation instruction, the court stated: \"I think the law is clear that I don't have to instruct on that. I just have to permit argument if there is a basis for it from the evidence.\" On appeal, the parties do not challenge the propriety of the court's suggestion that Booker could argue for an adverse inference to the jury. Therefore, we take no position on whether a court can properly decide that there is sufficient evidence to permit the parties to argue for an adverse inference to the jury, while at the same time declining to give a spoliation instruction. In this case, our focus is on whether the court correctly concluded that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support a spoliation jury instruction.</p>\n<p>[12]  Booker also notes that Wong testified that he discarded a United States Coast Guard Manual, which, she contends, was relevant to her claims because he relied on it for his decision to reallocate police dispatching duties at the hospital. However, the manual was not unique and, to the extent it was relevant, Booker could have obtained a copy of the publication from the Coast Guard. The court did not abuse its discretion in not permitting an adverse inference based on the discarded manual.</p>\n\n</div>",

A jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants on Booker's claims of retaliation under federal and state law, <i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 4(4), and tortious interference with contractual employment relations.

Although we conclude that the adverse action instruction was problematic, we reject that claim of error.</p>\n<p>Booker also argues that the court erroneously refused to instruct the jury on the doctrine of spoliation. Booker requested an instruction that the jury could draw an adverse inference based on the deletion of emails concerning Booker by certain hospital employees. We conclude that Booker failed to lay a proper evidentiary foundation for a spoliation instruction and therefore the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give it. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Booker, an African-American woman, began working at the Lemuel Shattuck Hospital (the hospital) as a telephone operator in the late 1980s. In 2001, she was promoted to \"Communications Dispatcher II.\" Booker's responsibilities in her new position included dispatching the hospital's campus police officers and supervising the telephone operators, or \"Communication Dispatcher I's,\" who staffed the communications department. The communications department performed functions such as screening and receiving incoming calls, transferring calls to other departments, receiving emergency calls from within the hospital, assisting with dispatching, and greeting visitors.</p>\n<p>On September 9, 2003, Booker met with Shawn McMullen, then her immediate supervisor, and Edward Nicosia, then the hospital's Deputy Director of Facilities Management,<sup>[1]</sup> to express concern that she was receiving telephone calls from her staff while she was off duty. Nicosia explained that under her collective bargaining agreement she was entitled to \"call-back pay\" for work-related calls received at home. Later that day, Nicosia and McMullen circulated a memorandum to Booker's staff discouraging them from calling <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> their supervisor at home except in emergency situations, and copied Booker.</p>\n<p>Several months later, on December 15, 2003, Booker hand-delivered a letter to Nicosia complaining that the hospital had discriminated against her based on race by failing to compensate her for off-duty calls. In the letter, Booker asserted that she was owed call-back pay for seventy-five calls she had received at home over the past two years, and that McMullen, who is white, was receiving off-duty calls from Booker's staff that should have gone to her. She stated that the sole reason for this unequal treatment was race and that her letter represented \"a relatively whispering salvo in what could become a vigorous public challenge of rampant institutional racism at the Hospital.\"</p>\n<p>Later that same day, Booker confronted McMullen in the campus police department, located in the hospital's main lobby. In a raised voice, Booker asked McMullen why members of her staff were calling him after hours instead of her and whether the hospital had a policy of only paying white supervisors for off-duty calls. She asserted that this was racism and she would speak with a lawyer. In early January 2004, Nicosia and McMullen had a meeting with Booker to discuss the December 15 incident. Booker apologized for confronting McMullen in such a public setting, but did not retract her complaints. Ultimately, in late January, she was issued a written warning for her behavior. On February 6, 2004, Booker filed the first of several administrative complaints with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging race discrimination and retaliation.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In the months that followed Booker's December 15 letter of complaint, Nicosia took several actions related to payroll and timekeeping procedures that displeased Booker. In January 2004, Nicosia removed the communications logbook from Booker's desk and replaced it with a new logbook. Members of the communications department used the log to record information such as shift assignments, staff absences, and phone calls to staff at home, and the logbook removed by Nicosia contained entries related to Booker's claim for call-back pay. The following month, Booker and Nicosia had a disagreement about allocation of personal time. Noticing that Booker had missed twelve hours of work but had not reported the absences on her timesheet, Nicosia deducted twelve hours of her personal time. When Booker discovered this deduction, she informed Nicosia that she preferred to use a combination of sick time, vacation time, and leave without pay to cover the time off. Although Nicosia asked Booker to make this correction by submitting a payroll adjustment form, she instead called the payroll department and had them make the change. After discovering that Booker made the payroll change without the appropriate paperwork, Nicosia submitted a payroll adjustment form again designating Booker's absences as personal time. Booker complained, but Nicosia refused to have her personal time returned.</p>\n<p>Finally, in February 2005, Nicosia learned that Booker was logging her time in the communications log and reviewing her own timesheets as well as those of her staff. Nicosia directed Human Resources to make changes so that Booker was required to enter her time in the so-called steward's log and submit her weekly time-sheets <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> to her immediate supervisor for review.</p>\n<p>Changes were also made to Booker's job responsibilities over the 2004-2005 period. In the fall of 2004, Richard Wong joined the hospital as the director of safety and security and replaced McMullen as Booker's immediate supervisor. Sometime thereafter, Wong hired additional police officers and informed Booker that whenever at least five officers were on duty, an officer would perform dispatching duties. Booker continued to fill in as a dispatcher on an as-needed basis, around four or five times per month, but it was no longer a regular part of her job duties. Wong also requested that Booker get trained to perform mailroom duties, which consisted of sorting incoming mail in the morning and metering outgoing mail in the afternoon, so that she could cover the mailroom on occasion. Other employees, including Wong, covered the mailroom when the regular mailroom clerk was out, and the job description for Booker's position, Communications Dispatcher II, listed sorting and delivering mail as one of her job responsibilities. However, Booker refused the mailroom training and resisted performing mailroom duties, viewing them as less prestigious than her other duties. As a result, she rarely covered the mailroom, filling in there for the first time on December 30, 2005.</p>\n<p>Finally, in June 2005, Booker was suspended for one day without pay following a confrontation with a campus police officer. The officer, hurrying to get to an assigned location at the hospital on time, exchanged his radio for the radio on Booker's desk, which had a belt clip. Raising her voice, she chastised him for taking her radio and called him derogatory names. People passing through the busy hospital lobby observed the incident.</p>\n<p>In October 2005, Booker filed this action in federal district court against the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), and four individual defendants, including Nicosia.<sup>[3]</sup> Booker alleged, inter alia, that defendants retaliated against her for complaining about discriminatory withholding of callback pay and for filing complaints with the MCAD,<sup>[4]</sup> and that the individual defendants intentionally interfered with her contractual employment relationships. Following pretrial dispositions not at issue in this appeal,<sup>[5]</sup> Booker proceeded to trial on her retaliation claims against DPH, EOHHS and Nicosia (hereafter, defendants), and her tortious interference claim against Nicosia.</p>\n<p>At trial, the court instructed the jury as to the actions that Booker maintained were retaliatory:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> [T]he written warning issued in January of 2004; the removal of the communications logbook from the desk where she worked; the February 2004 incident involving Mr. Nicosia's reduction of her personal time for an unreported absence; the requirement that she sign for her time on the stewards' log rather than the communication dispatchers' log; the reduction in her police dispatching duties; her assignment to mailroom duties and training, and her one-day suspension in June of 2005.</blockquote>\n<p>After a five-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants on all claims. The district court denied Booker's post-judgment motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial. On appeal, Booker contends, as she did in her motion for a new trial, that (1) the district court improperly instructed the jury on the required showing of a materially adverse action for purposes of her retaliation claim, and (2) the court erred in refusing to give a spoliation jury instruction. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Retaliation Jury Instruction</h2>\n<p>At trial, the district court instructed the jury on the requisite showing of a materially adverse action under Title VII:</p>\n<blockquote>Under federal and state law, Ms. Booker must prove ... by a preponderance of the evidence ... that the desire to retaliate because of [her complaints of discrimination] was a motivating and determinative factor in any decision to alter Ms. Booker's terms and conditions of employment in a materially adverse manner....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>An employment action <i>to be adverse must materially change the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment.</i> Examples the law gives include demotions, disadvantageous transfers or assignments, the loss of promotions, unwarranted negative evaluations, toleration of harassing conduct by co-employees, <i>and reprisals intended to discourage other employees from complaining about unlawful practices or reprisals that might be perceived in that way by other employees looking at them reasonably.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Booker contends on appeal that this instruction misstated the legal standard applicable to her retaliation claim as set forth in <i>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span> (2006). First, she contends that the instruction erroneously required a showing that an adverse action affect the terms and conditions of her employment. Second, she argues that the final phrase in the exemplary list of adverse actions, beginning with \"and reprisals,\" improperly required her to demonstrate that the reprisals be intended to discourage, or reasonably be perceived as intended to discourage, employee complaints.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>A party who objects to an instruction must \"stat[e] distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c)(1). Under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> the procedure outlined in Rule 51, before the trial court charges the jury it must inform the parties of its proposed instructions and receive any objections. Fed. R.Civ.P. 51(b); <i>Surprenant v. Rivas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201815\"><a href=\"/opinion/201815/surprenant-v-rivas/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2005). An objection made at that time \"preserves <i>the underlying issue</i> for appeal.\" <i>Surprenant,</i> 424 F.3d at 15 (emphasis added) (citing Fed. R.Civ.P. 51(c)(2)(A)). If, however, a party is \"not informed of an instruction or action on a request\" during the precharge conference, the party may object \"promptly after learning that the instruction or request will be, or has been, given or refused.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c)(2)(B). The requirements of Rule 51 \"are not to be taken lightly\" and \"there is a high price to be paid for noncompliance.\" <i>DeCaro v. Hasbro, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203989\"><a href=\"/opinion/203989/decaro-v-hasbro-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">580</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2009). Failure to comply with the rule ordinarily results in forfeiture of \"the objection to which the failure relates,\" and we review forfeited objections only for plain error. <i>Id.</i> (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(d)(2)). Our strict enforcement of the object-or-forfeit rule serves \"to compel litigants to afford the trial court an opportunity to cure [a] defective instruction and to prevent the litigants from ensuring a new trial in the event of an adverse verdict by covertly relying on the error.\" <i>Flynn v. AK Peters, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201153\"><a href=\"/opinion/201153/flynn-v-ak-peters-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2004) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>In this case, the court discussed its tentative jury instructions with the parties at a sidebar conference held before the jury was charged.<sup>[7]</sup> The court stated that it planned to add, at the end of the adverse action instruction, the phrase \"Reprisals intended to discourage other employees from complaining about unlawful practices.\" Booker's counsel objected, stating:</p>\n<blockquote>I am concerned that, as I heard the instruction, that the employer intended to deter other employees, I don't think it's necessary that he intended to deter, so long as it was reasonably foreseeable that it would deter. In other words, I don't believe there is an intention requirement as to the deterrence. It's only that it be a deterrent. He must intend to retaliate but the effect must, in effect, deter a reasonable employee, not that he intended to deter others....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The <i>Burlington</i> Court, talked about and used language, \"an adverse action consists of any action that may dissuade a reason[able] employee from engaging in protected activity.\"</blockquote>\n<p>In response, the court noted that it \"might add, `Or reasonably would have been perceived by the employe[e],' but I just don't want to turn this into a strict-liability tort.\" Booker's counsel did not voice any further objection. The court gave the modified instruction to the jury, stating that examples of adverse actions include \"reprisals intended to discourage other employees from complaining about unlawful practices <i>or reprisals that might be perceived in that way by other employees looking at them reasonably</i>.\" (Emphasis added.) The court held a sidebar conference after the charge, inviting any \"[]new\" objections, but Booker's counsel raised no objection to the instruction as given.</p>\n<p>As this account makes clear, Booker never objected in the district court on the first ground she presses on appealthat the instruction improperly stated that an adverse action must \"materially change the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment.\" That objection is therefore forfeited. <i>See </i><i>Boston Gas Co. v. Century Indem. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2008) (holding that objection was forfeited where party made an objection to court's proposed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> instruction, but on grounds unrelated to the aspect it criticized on appeal).</p>\n<p>Booker did object at the precharge conference on the ground that the tentative instruction improperly required that a materially adverse action be intended to discourage employee complaints. However, the court then proposed adding instructional language to address Booker's concern, and Booker did not object after being apprised of the court's proposed modification or after hearing the modified instruction given to the jury. The \"purpose of a sidebar objection is to inform the judge exactly what he got wrong and what he should do to remedy the incipient harm.\" <i>DeCaro,</i> 580 F.3d at 61. By failing to object to the modified instruction either before or after the charge, Booker failed to inform the court that she believed the instruction was still problematic, specify the grounds for her objection, or give the court an opportunity to correct any error. Therefore, this objection is also forfeited. <i>See, e.g., Kirk v. Reed Tool Co.,</i> 247 Fed. Appx. 485, 486 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (unpublished) (\"[W]hile [plaintiff] may have objected to the original jury charge, he did <i>not</i> object to the supplemental charge. Therefore, our review is only for plain error.\"); <i>Cooney v. Booth,</i> 28 Fed. Appx. 148, 151 (3d Cir.2002) (unpublished) (reviewing instruction for plain error because \"absent a specific objection following the actual charge, [the court] had no way of knowing that its efforts to accommodate the general objection made at the [precharge] conference had not been wholly successful\").<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Noting that Rule 51 was amended effective December 1, 2003, Booker argues that her objections were properly preserved under the amended rule. We have acknowledged that the 2003 amendments to Rule 51 made changes to the procedure for lodging objections. Under the former version of the rule, objections were not preserved unless they were \"taken at sidebar <i>after</i> the trial judge had charged the jury.\" <i>Surprenant,</i> 424 F.3d at 15 n. 3 (emphasis added). Thus, even if a party properly objected to a proposed instruction prior to the jury charge and the court then gave the challenged instruction, that objection was forfeited unless the party renewed the objection after the jury charge. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>McGrath v. Spirito,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"435230\"><a href=\"/opinion/435230/marion-mcgrath-v-carlo-spirito-jr-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 968-69 (1st Cir.1984). We have also noted that the 2003 amendments \"were designed in part to ease the burden on parties in preserving their objections to instructions where the district court had already made a definitive ruling, on the record, rejecting a request for a particular instruction.\" <i>Colón-Millín v. Sears Roebuck De Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202321\"><a href=\"/opinion/202321/colon-millin-v-sears-roebuck/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 40 n. 7 (1st Cir. 2006). However, the 2003 amendments do not assist Booker here. Nothing in the amended rule suggests that a party may preserve a claim of error by objecting to a tentative instruction at the precharge conference, but then failing to object after the instruction is modified to accommodate the initial objection.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> Therefore, we review the legal standards stated in the jury instructions only for plain error. In doing so, we bear two precepts in mind. The first is that the district court has wide discretion over the particular words it chooses to convey those standards. <i>See </i><i>Johnson v. Spencer Press of Me., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200973\"><a href=\"/opinion/200973/johnson-v-spencer-press-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, 378 (1st Cir. 2004); <i>Interstate Litho Corp. v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199486\"><a href=\"/opinion/199486/interstate-litho-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 29 n. 11 (1st Cir.2001). The second is that jury instructions must be viewed as a whole. <i>See </i><i>Hopkins v. Jordan Marine, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199655\"><a href=\"/opinion/199655/hopkins-v-jordan-marine-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Analysis</h2>\n<p>In order to make out her retaliation claim under Title VII, Booker had to show that \"(1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) she suffered some materially adverse action; and (3) the adverse action was causally linked to her protected activity.\" <i>Dixon v. Int'l Bhd. of Police Officers,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></span>, 81 (1st Cir.2007). In <i>Burlington,</i> the Court clarified the legal standard for the required showing of an adverse action under Title VII's antiretaliation provision. <i>Burlington</i> first addressed the question of whether the antiretaliation provision \"forbids only those employer actions and resulting harms that are related to employment or the workplace.\" 548 U.S. at 61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span>. Recognizing that an employer can effectively retaliate against an employee through actions \"not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm <i>outside</i> the workplace,\" the Court held that Title VII's antiretaliation provision, unlike the statute's substantive antidiscrimination provision, \"is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 63-64, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court next addressed the question of \"how harmful an act of retaliatory discrimination must be in order to fall within the provision's scope.\" <i>Id.</i> at 61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span>. The Court held that the antiretaliation provision covers those \"employer actions that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee,\" that is, actions that are \"harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 57, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span>. Thus, whether an action is materially adverse is judged by an objective rather than a subjective standard. <i>Id.</i> at 68-69, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Instruction's Language Regarding Reprisals \"Intended to Discourage\" Employees or Reasonably \"Perceived in that Way\"</h2>\n<p>Relying on <i>Burlington,</i> Booker primarily challenges the final clause of the adverse action instruction, \"reprisals intended to discourage other employees from complaining about unlawful practices or reprisals that might be perceived in that way by other employees looking at them reasonably.\"</p>\n<p>Booker claims that the first clause \"reprisals intended to discourage other employees\"erroneously conflated the adverse action element of a Title VII claim, which she says does not look to the employer's intent, with the retaliation element, which considers the employer's retaliatory motive. She concludes that the instruction imposed a higher burden of proof on the adverse action element by requiring her to show that her employer's intent was to discourage other employees' complaints. <i>Burlington,</i> Booker says, only required her to show that the employer's actions might dissuade a reasonable employee from complaining of discrimination.</p>\n<p>While the language in this phrase of the instruction was awkward and created numerous potential issues, including <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> some not raised by Booker,<sup>[10]</sup> we cannot say that the instruction on adverse action was error. When evaluating claims of error in jury instructions, our task is not to parse particular phrases, but to look at the instructions as a whole in light of the relevant standard of review. Taken together, the adverse action instructions were not so clearly divergent from the <i>Burlington</i> standard as to constitute plain error.</p>\n<p>The challenged portion of the instruction was part of a longer sentence listing examples of materially adverse actions; it was not the lone basis given to the jury to understand the legal definition of an adverse action. Whatever objection there might be to the challenged phrase of the \"reprisals\" portion of the instruction, the instruction was saved by the alternative formulation at the end of the sentence: \"or reprisals that might be perceived in that way by other employees looking at them reasonably.\"</p>\n<p>Given its placement, the likely reading of the final phrase (and the meaning ascribed to it by the district court) was that it referred to \"reprisals that might be perceived in that way [that is, <i>as discouraging complaints</i> about unlawful practices] by other employees looking at them reasonably.\"</p>\n<p>That interpretation accurately captures the <i>Burlington</i> standard: it conveys that the standard is an objective one, based on the vantage of a reasonable employee, and that the critical inquiry is whether the reprisals might deter a reasonable employee from complaining of discrimination. That interpretation is also reinforced by the context of this phrase in relation to the rest of the jury instructions: it immediately preceded a paragraph further explaining to the jury that adverse actions did not include things like \"hurt feelings\" and \"subjective disappointments\" that might dissuade a hyper-sensitive employee but would not deter a reasonable employee. Viewed as a whole, the adverse action instruction was not plainly erroneous. We do, though, recommend that instructions on retaliation hew more closely to <i>Burlington</i> and <i>Dixon.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Instruction's Language that \"Employment Action to be Adverse Must Change the Terms and Conditions\" of Employment</h2>\n<p>Booker also contends that the adverse action instruction erroneously stated that an adverse action must \"change the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment.\" However, while Booker correctly notes that the antiretaliation provision of Title VII \"is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment,\" <i>Burlington,</i> 548 U.S. at 64, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span>, the district court was entitled to tailor its instruction to the evidence presented at trial. Each of the allegedly retaliatory acts against Booker, including written warnings, personal time allocation, modifications in payroll procedures, changes or reductions in job duties, and suspension without pay, were related to her employment and occurred at the workplace. <i>Cf. </i><i>Burlington,</i> 548 U.S. at 63-64, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span> (citing examples of actionable retaliation causing harm \"<i>outside</i> the workplace,\" including FBI's refusal to investigate death threats against employee and employer's filing of false criminal charges against former employee). On the facts of this case, the court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> properly confined its instruction to workplace-related actions. Therefore, we cannot say that this portion of the instruction was erroneous.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Spoliation Jury Instruction</h2>\n<p>Booker next contends that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jurors that they could draw an adverse inference if they found that defendants destroyed documents relevant to Booker's claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Evidence and Requested Instruction on Spoliation</h2>\n<p>At trial, Booker cross-examined three hospital employees about their deletion of email correspondence concerning Booker. Wong, who became Booker's immediate supervisor in the fall of 2004, testified that shortly after he began working at the hospital, he was informed that Booker had filed an administrative complaint against the hospital and that it was possible he could become a defendant, although he did not know the subject matter of her claims. Wong further testified that he regularly deleted all of the emails in his \"sent\" and \"deleted\" email folders every thirty days, and did not do anything in particular to preserve emails concerning Booker. Paul Romary, the hospital's executive director, testified that he received a copy of Booker's December 2003 letter of complaint. He explained that he received a hundred emails a day, some of which he deleted, and made no special effort to preserve his emails concerning Booker. Barbara McLaughlin, an executive vice president of the hospital and Wong's supervisor beginning in December 2005, testified that she never deleted any emails concerning Booker.</p>\n<p>Prior to trial, Booker submitted a proposed jury instruction on the spoliation of evidence:</p>\n<blockquote>If the evidence indicates that a party has destroyed records relevant to a pending lawsuit or that may be relevant to a lawsuit that could arise in the future, you may reasonably infer that the party probably did so because the records would harm its case. The non-destroying party need not have offered direct evidence of a cover-up for you to infer that the party who destroyed evidence did so because the records were unfavorable to its position or would harm its case.</blockquote>\n<p>The court refused to give the requested instruction, and Booker recorded her objection at the precharge conference. In its order denying Booker's motion for a new trial, the court again rejected Booker's claim that the jury should have been given the spoliation instruction. The court reasoned that \"because Booker did not present any evidence at trial that Wong or defendants engaged in the deliberate spo[li]ation of evidence, no instruction on an adverse inference was merited. Indeed, such an instruction would have been misleading and prejudicial to defendants.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Legal Framework on Spoliation</h2>\n<p>Where a proper evidentiary foundation has been laid, \"a trier of fact may (but need not) infer from a party's obliteration of a document relevant to a litigated issue that the contents of the document were unfavorable to that party.\" <i>Testa v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197959\"><a href=\"/opinion/197959/testa-v-wal-mart/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span>, 177 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also </i><i>Nation-Wide Check Corp., Inc. v. Forest Hills Distribs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"410380\"><a href=\"/opinion/410380/nation-wide-check-corporation-inc-v-forest-hills-distributors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 217-218 (1st Cir.1982) (Breyer, J.). This adverse inference is based in part on the commonsense observation that a party who \"destroys a document (or permits it to be destroyed) when facing litigation, knowing the document's relevancy to issues in the case, may well do so out of a sense that the document's contents hurt his position.\" <i>Testa,</i> 144 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> F.3d at 177; <i>accord </i><i>Nation-Wide Check,</i> 692 F.2d at 218. The inference is also based on prophylactic and punitive rationales: it serves to deter litigants from destroying relevant evidence prior to trial and to penalize a party whose misconduct creates the risk of an erroneous judgment. <i>Nation-Wide Check,</i> 692 F.2d at 218.</p>\n<p>Before an adverse inference can arise, the sponsor of the inference must lay an evidentiary foundation, proffering evidence sufficient to show that the party who destroyed the document \"knew of (a) the claim (that is, the litigation or the potential for litigation), and (b) the document's potential relevance to that claim.\" <i>Testa,</i> 144 F.3d at 177; <i>see also id.</i> at 178 (noting that adequate foundation depends upon evidence of \"institutional noticethe aggregate knowledge possessed by a party and its agents, servants and employees\"). A spoliation instruction is not warranted absent this threshold showing, because the trier of fact would have no basis for inferring that the destruction of documents stemmed from the party's consciousness that the documents would damage his case.</p>\n<p>A \"trial court's decision to give or refuse an adverse inference instruction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Gilbert v. Cosco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602916\"><a href=\"/opinion/602916/38-fed-r-evid-serv-557-prodliabrep-cch-p-13446-gregory-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 406 (10th Cir.1993); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. St. Michael's Credit Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526736\"><a href=\"/opinion/526736/united-states-v-st-michaels-credit-union-and-janice-sacharczyk/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 597 (1st Cir.1989) (stating that trial court's decision to give or refuse missing witness instruction is committed to its sound discretion).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Analysis</h2>\n<p>As an initial matter, Booker argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard when it stated that because there was no evidence presented at trial that \"Wong or defendants engaged in the deliberate spo[li]ation of evidence, no instruction on an adverse inference was merited.\"<sup>[11]</sup> However, we understand the district court's reference to \"deliberate\" spoliation as simply a shorthand for the evidentiary foundation required to support an adverse inference. In other words, the district court concluded that Booker failed to make the required threshold showing that defendants destroyed emails (or permitted their destruction) while on notice of Booker's claims and the emails' potential relevance to those claims. Therefore, the jury would have no basis for inferring that defendants destroyed the emails \"out of a sense that the document's contents hurt [defendants'] position,\" and so a spoliation instruction was not warranted. <i>Testa,</i> 144 F.3d at 177; <i>see also </i><i>Nation-Wide Check,</i> 692 F.2d at 219.</p>\n<p>Booker further contends that the court erred in finding that she failed to lay an adequate foundation for a spoliation instruction. She contends that she produced sufficient evidence at trial to prove that at the time defendants deleted the emails (or permitted their destruction), they had knowledge both of her claims against them and of the emails' potential relevance to those claims.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the evidence at trial was insufficient to merit a spoliation instruction. Booker presented no evidence that McLaughlin deleted any emails concerning her, whether potentially relevant or not. Indeed, McLaughlin testified repeatedly that although she sometimes deleted emails, she never deleted any emails concerning Booker. Booker did elicit testimony from Wong and Romary that they regularly deleted their emails and may have deleted some concerning her. However, she proffered no evidence that any of those emails were even potentially relevant <i>to her claims in this case,</i> or that defendants knew of their potential relevance. Although permitted to cross-examine Wong and Romary about their deletion of emails, Booker did not question either witness about the content of the deleted emails or about whether the emails were relevant to her claims.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, unlike many spoliation cases, this is not a case in which a document's potential relevance to the plaintiff's claims is apparent from the nature of the missing document itself. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Testa,</i> 144 F.3d at 177 (finding notice of potential relevance where company destroyed purchase order for delivery on date of plaintiff's injury, and company's \"defense from the start was anchored on the premise that it had no reason to anticipate any deliveries on the day in question\"); <i>Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196700\"><a href=\"/opinion/196700/blinzler-v-marriott-intl/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span>, 1158-59 (1st Cir.1996) (finding notice of potential relevance where hotel destroyed log of outgoing phone calls from day of hotel guest's death, and hotel knew of guest's death and of plaintiff spouse's \"persistent attempts\" to discover when the hotel placed the call for emergency aid).</p>\n<p>In sum, Booker produced evidence showing merely that two hospital employees, Wong and Romary, routinely deleted their emails, some of which may have concerned her. She produced no evidence that defendants destroyed emails with knowledge that the emails were potentially relevant to her claims in this case. Because Booker failed to establish the required evidentiary foundation for an adverse inference, the court properly concluded that a spoliation instruction was not warranted.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Later in 2003, Nicosia became the Acting Director of Facilities, and sometime in the end of 2004 or beginning of 2005, he became the Director of Facilities.</p>\n<p>[2]  Booker filed a second administrative complaint for retaliation in May 2005 and a third administrative complaint sometime thereafter.</p>\n<p>[3]  The individual defendants named in the complaint were Nicosia, McMullen, the hospital's Executive Director Paul Romary, and Director of Labor Relations Jennifer Foley.</p>\n<p>[4]  Although Booker brought her retaliation claims under both state and federal law, the parties have not suggested that the state and federal antiretaliation provisions differ in any way material to the issues on appeal. Therefore, we focus our analysis on the standards for retaliation under Title VII and do not separately analyze the analogous retaliation provision under state law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 4(4).</p>\n<p>[5]  The court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on Booker's claims for racial discrimination, interference with the right to be free from discrimination, and aiding, abetting, inciting or compelling discrimination. Booker voluntarily dismissed her claims for libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress against all defendants, and dismissed her tortious interference claim against all defendants except Nicosia. Finally, the court dismissed all remaining claims against Romary, Foley and McMullen.</p>\n<p>[6]  The next paragraph of the instructions described what were not adverse actions, though this portion of the instruction is not at issue:\n</p>\n<p>Adverse job actions do not include hurt feelings, subjective disappointments, disillusionment over an employer's actions, or expected losses of job function or responsibilities because of a business or corporate reorganization. It also does not [in]clude everyday workplace banter or teasing, which all of us are familiar with.</p>\n<p>[7]  The court's tentative instructions apparently were not made part of the record.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although the cited opinions are unpublished, we rely on them for their persuasive value.</p>\n<p>[9]  Booker also argues that she did not object at the postcharge conference because the district court stated that it would hear only \"[]new\" objections, and she had already objected to the adverse action instruction at the precharge conference. However, Booker's earlier objection was made to the court's tentative instruction, not to the revised instruction intended to accommodate her concerns, and thus Booker's objection to the newly modified instruction would have been new. Moreover, counsel had a duty to object \"even at the risk of incurring the displeasure of the trial court.\" <i>Flynn,</i> 377 F.3d at 25 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>[10]  Though Booker claims that this clause of the instructions imposed a higher burden of proof on her to show adverse action, that is not necessarily the case. The clause could, for instance, be read to allow a jury to find liability based on intent without materiality, a standard that would lessen Booker's burden.</p>\n<p>[11]  We note that at the earlier precharge conference, in response to Booker's objection to its refusal to give the spoliation instruction, the court stated: \"I think the law is clear that I don't have to instruct on that. I just have to permit argument if there is a basis for it from the evidence.\" On appeal, the parties do not challenge the propriety of the court's suggestion that Booker could argue for an adverse inference to the jury. Therefore, we take no position on whether a court can properly decide that there is sufficient evidence to permit the parties to argue for an adverse inference to the jury, while at the same time declining to give a spoliation instruction. In this case, our focus is on whether the court correctly concluded that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support a spoliation jury instruction.</p>\n<p>[12]  Booker also notes that Wong testified that he discarded a United States Coast Guard Manual, which, she contends, was relevant to her claims because he relied on it for his decision to reallocate police dispatching duties at the hospital. However, the manual was not unique and, to the extent it was relevant, Booker could have obtained a copy of the publication from the Coast Guard. The court did not abuse its discretion in not permitting an adverse inference based on the discarded manual.</p>\n\n</div>",
