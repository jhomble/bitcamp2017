TOBIN,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n                LIBERTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                  Torruella, Lipez, and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Frank J. Frisoli, with whom Frisoli & Frisoli, was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Alan D. Rose, with whom Richard E. Bowman and Rose &\nAssociates, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        December 23, 2005\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.       Plaintiff-appellant Kevin W.\n\nTobin appeals the award of summary judgment to his former employer,\n\nLiberty Mutual Insurance Company (\"Liberty Mutual\"), on his state\n\nand federal claims of disability discrimination and failure to\n\naccommodate,    pursuant   to   the   Americans   with   Disabilities    Act\n\n(\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. (2000), and the Massachusetts\n\nanti-discrimination statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B (\"Chapter\n\n151B\").     Because we believe that summary judgment was improperly\n\ngranted on Tobin's \"failure to accommodate\" claim, we vacate the\n\ndistrict court's judgment on that claim.          We affirm, however, the\n\nremainder of the district court's decision.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            Tobin was hired by Liberty Mutual on September 17, 1964\n\nfor an administrative position.         In May 1968, he was promoted to\n\nsales representative, a position he held until his termination in\n\nJanuary 2001. As a sales representative, Tobin was responsible for\n\nselling insurance, including automobile, home, and life insurance.\n\nHe was also expected to assist in customer service and retain\n\nbusiness.\n\n            Since 1976, Tobin has been under the regular care of a\n\npsychiatrist, mainly for treatment of bipolar disorder.                 This\n\ncondition limited Tobin's focus and concentration, impaired his\n\nability to prioritize and complete tasks, required that he have\n\nmore time to finish his work, and affected his organizational\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fskills. It was only in December 1997, however, that Tobin revealed\n\nhis condition to officials at the company.\n\nA.    Tobin's Performance\n\n               Although Tobin had accumulated a large book of business\n\nover the years and the annual premiums generated from this book of\n\nbusiness earned \"significant profits,\" Tobin's yearly new business\n\nsales were considered deficient beginning in 1992.                     For example,\n\nfor the twelve-month period ending September 1993, Tobin had sold\n\nonly 270 new policies -- a significant shortfall given that the\n\nquota    for    new   policy   sales   was    set   at   339.      In    his   Sales\n\nRepresentative Appraisal for that year, on a scale from 1-6, with\n\n1 being the highest, Tobin received a 6 in the \"Sales Rating\"\n\ncategory.      His overall evaluation was a 5.           In 1994-1996 and 1998,\n\nTobin's appraisals reflect similar negative ratings and comments\n\nfor sales, prospecting, performance, and overall performance, and\n\npositive       ratings   and   comments   for   quality,        loss    ratio,   and\n\nretention.1\n\n               In April 1996, Tobin's supervisor, Mike Robin, gave Tobin\n\na    written     warning   stating     that   failure     to    meet     the   sales\n\nrequirements for a thirty-day period would lead to a sixty-day\n\nprobation followed by possible termination. Although Tobin did not\n\nmeet the requirements for the thirty-day period, Liberty Mutual\n\nwaived the probation because Tobin's wife was ill. On November 21,\n\n\n1\n     No appraisal was produced for 1997.\n\n                                        -3-\n\f1997, Robin placed Tobin on a nine-week warning period, emphasizing\n\nthat new business sales were critical, as were participation in\n\nsales   initiatives       and   refraining     from    \"inappropriate       and\n\ninsubordinate behavior in the office,\" including the use of profane\n\nlanguage.    Robin made clear that Tobin would face probation unless\n\nhe   brought   his    performance   up    to   an     acceptable   level     by\n\ndemonstrating increased sales results and participating in sales\n\ninitiatives.\n\n            Tobin then took two short-term disability leaves of\n\nabsence.    The first lasted from December 1997 until June 1998, and\n\nthe second from September 1998 until January 1999.                    In both\n\ninstances, Tobin's doctor, Dr. William Kantar, indicated that he\n\nhad diagnosed Tobin as bipolar and that Tobin was significantly\n\nrestricted     as    to   interpersonal   relations,      as   well    as    to\n\noccupational and social activities.          Each time Tobin returned to\n\nwork, Tobin's new supervisor, Manina Schwitters, gave Tobin a\n\nreduced work schedule for his first four weeks after he returned\n\nfrom leave.     Each time, upon resumption of his full-time duties,\n\nTobin's warning period was reinstated.\n\n            When Tobin returned to work the second time, in January\n\n1999, Liberty Mutual hired a nurse, Cathy Harding, to assist him in\n\nresuming his position as a sales representative.               After working\n\nreduced hours for four weeks, Tobin resumed his full-time duties on\n\nFebruary 1, 1999.         Tobin's supervisor extended the two weeks\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fremaining from the November 1997 warning period to run for four\n\nweeks, from February 1 to February 26.                   Tobin failed to sell\n\ntwenty-four new policies during the four-week warning period to\n\navoid beginning a four-week probation period.                   However, during a\n\nmeeting with several supervisors, Tobin produced several additional\n\npolicies, which were accepted in order to meet the quota set for\n\nthe warning period.\n\n               In a letter dated March 8, 1999, Schwitters indicated\n\nthat   she      would    monitor     Tobin's     sales   results     in    four-week\n\nincrements for the rest of the year beginning on March 1.                       At the\n\nend of the first increment, Schwitters notified Tobin he was being\n\nplaced    on    probation      for   failing     to   meet     the   minimum     sales\n\nrequirements.         The quota for the period had been twenty-four, and\n\nTobin sold only ten.           Tobin then successfully completed the five-\n\nweek probationary period by selling the required thirty policies.\n\nTobin's sales performance, however, deteriorated over the next\n\nseveral      months,     and    he   was    again     placed    on   probation      on\n\nNovember 27, 2000.             Tobin failed to sell the required thirty\n\npolicies during this second probationary period and was terminated\n\non January 10, 2001.\n\nB.   Mass Marketing Accounts\n\n               Mass    Marketing     accounts     (\"MM   accounts\")       are    group\n\ninsurance discount programs offered to businesses and associations\n\nthroughout the United States. The employees or association members\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fwho   purchase    insurance      policies      through    MM     accounts     receive\n\nbenefits such as discounted policy premiums, automatic deduction of\n\npremium payments from paychecks, and a waiver of finance and\n\nservice charges.      MM accounts provide sales representatives with\n\naccess   to    employees    of     participating       employers       in   workplace\n\nsettings and thereby afford sales representatives exposure to a\n\nlarge volume of potential clients. These MM accounts are desirable\n\nto the sales representatives because they provide a good source for\n\npotential sales.\n\n              Tobin says he repeatedly requested to be assigned MM\n\naccounts and to be provided with adequate sales support.                          He\n\nmaintains that Liberty Mutual's failure to assign him MM accounts\n\nwas both a denial of a reasonable accommodation and discriminatory\n\npursuant to state and federal law.             Tobin argues that but for the\n\nfailure of Liberty Mutual to assign him MM accounts and to provide\n\nadequate sales support, he would have been able to meet the sales\n\nquotas set for him.\n\n              The parties dispute whether assigning Tobin a MM account\n\nwould have violated Liberty Mutual's policy for assigning such\n\naccounts.       Liberty Mutual contends that the MM accounts were\n\ndistributed     on   the   basis    of   merit    --     given    to    those   sales\n\nrepresentatives who most actively took initiative to land new MM\n\naccounts -- as well as according to workload.                     Tobin, however,\n\ncontends that on at least one occasion Schwitters violated this\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fpolicy by assigning an MM account to Herb Schneiderman, a sales\n\nrepresentative with a substandard sales performance, and that Tobin\n\ncould have likewise been assigned such accounts despite his below-\n\nquota sales.   Liberty Mutual responds that Schwitter's assignments\n\nwere not inconsistent because, unlike Tobin, Schneiderman at least\n\ntook some initiative to open new MM accounts.               Liberty Mutual\n\nfurther argues that, in any event, there is no evidence that Tobin\n\nwould have been able to handle adequately such an account were it\n\nassigned to him or that he would have been able to meet the quotas,\n\neven with MM accounts.\n\n          Tobin now appeals the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment for Liberty Mutual, arguing that the district court erred\n\nbecause (1) Liberty Mutual's explanation for Tobin's termination\n\nwas pretextual, (2) there was a nexus between his disability and\n\nthe requested accommodation of assignment of MM accounts, and (3)\n\nLiberty Mutual failed to engage in an \"interactive process\" to help\n\naccommodate Tobin's disability.\n\n                                      II.\n\n          We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo, see, e.g., Guzmán-Rosario v. United Parcel Service, Inc.,\n\n397 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 2005), and construe the record in the light\n\nmost favorable to Tobin.        See United Parcel Service, Inc. v.\n\nFlores-Galarza,   318   F.3d   323,    330   (1st   Cir.   2003).   Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\ffact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\nA.   Disability Discrimination Claim\n\n              In evaluating Tobin's disability discrimination claim\n\nunder   the    ADA   and   Chapter      151B,    we    use   the    burden-shifting\n\nframework outlined by the Supreme Court in McDonnell-Douglas Corp.\n\nv. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).2                  See Higgins v. New Balance\n\nAthletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d 252, 264 (1st Cir. 1999) (approving\n\nuse of McDonnell-Douglas framework in connection with ADA claims of\n\ndisability discrimination).          Under this approach, Tobin must first\n\nestablish a prima facie case by establishing that (1) he suffers\n\nfrom a disability or handicap, as defined by the ADA and Chapter\n\n151B, that (2) he was nevertheless able to perform the essential\n\nfunctions      of    his   job,   either        with    or   without      reasonable\n\naccommodation,       and   that   (3)    Liberty       Mutual      took   an   adverse\n\nemployment action against him because of, in whole or in part, his\n\n\n2\n   The district court noted that \"state and federal disability law\nare in accord, at least for present purposes.\" Tobin v. Liberty\nMutual Ins. Co., No. Civ.A.01-11979-DPW, 2004 WL 1922133 at *6 n.9\n(D. Mass. Aug. 30, 2004). We note, however, that the standards\nunder the ADA and Chapter 151B occasionally differ in ways that are\nrelevant to this case.     See, e.g., Dahill v. Police Dep't of\nBoston, 748 N.E.2d 956 (Mass. 2001) (rejecting, for the purposes of\nChapter 151B, the federal rule that mitigating or corrective\ndevices must be considered in determining whether an individual is\ndisabled). Here, we do not emphasize these differences, as the\nparties before the district court already stipulated that \"state\nand federal disability law are in accord\" for the purposes of this\ncase. For this reason, throughout the remainder of this opinion,\nwe frame our discussion primarily in terms of the ADA and federal\ncase law, as the district court did.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fprotected disability.    See McDonnell-Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802;\n\nCarroll v. Xerox Corp., 294 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir. 2002); Benoit\n\nv. Technical Mfg. Corp., 331 F.3d 166, 175 (1st Cir. 2003).     If\n\nTobin is able to do this, the burden then shifts to Liberty Mutual\n\nto articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its\n\nemployment decision and to produce credible evidence to show that\n\nthe reason advanced was the real reason.    McDonnell-Douglas, 411\n\nU.S. at 802.   Finally, if Liberty Mutual offers such a reason, the\n\nburden shifts back to Tobin, and he must proffer evidence to\n\nestablish that Liberty Mutual's non-discriminatory justification is\n\nmere pretext, cloaking discriminatory animus.    Id. at 804.   The\n\nultimate burden of proving unlawful discrimination rests at all\n\ntimes with Tobin.   Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod., Inc., 530\n\nU.S. 133, 143 (2000).3\n\n3\n   An alternative framework involves \"mixed-motive\" analysis, as\nestablished by the Supreme Court in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,\n490 U.S. 228 (1989). Mixed-motive analysis is appropriate where\nevidence exists that an employer considered both a proscribed\nfactor (for example, race or disability) and one or more legitimate\nfactors (for example, competence) in making an adverse employment\ndecision.   Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 241-242; Fernándes v.\nCosta Bros. Masonry, Inc., 199 F.3d 572, 580 (1st Cir. 1999). We\nbelieve that in this instance \"mixed-motive\" analysis is\ninapplicable. This is because Tobin raises the issue of the use of\n\"mixed-motive\" analysis for the first time on appeal. Contrary to\nTobin's claim that he made \"implicit reference\" to a mixed-motive\nargument in the district court, Tobin never argued below that his\nclaims should be analyzed under a mixed-motive framework. As the\ndistrict court stated, \"neither party here disputes that the\npretext model [as opposed to a mixed-motive model] is the proper\nmode of analysis for this case.\"     Tobin, 2004 WL 1922133 at *6\nn.10. Theories not raised in the district court cannot be raised\nfor the first time on appeal. See Rocafort v. IBM Corp., 334 F.3d\n115, 121 (1st Cir. 2003) (stating that \"'a litigant's failure to\n\n                                -9-\n\f           Here, it is undisputed that Tobin has established a prima\n\nfacie case and that Liberty Mutual has advanced a legitimate, non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason for its employment decision.           The issue in\n\ndispute here is whether Liberty Mutual's asserted reason was\n\npretextual -- i.e., that the reason was advanced merely to disguise\n\nLiberty Mutual's real reason for terminating Tobin's employment,\n\nhis disability.    \"In assessing pretext, the court must look at the\n\ntotal package of proof offered by the plaintiff.\" Benoit, 331 F.3d\n\nat 174.\n\n           Tobin argues that Liberty Mutual's proffered reason is\n\nindeed a pretext and that he was fired because of his disability.\n\nTobin, however, has to clear two significant hurdles before he is\n\nable to show pretext.    First, he must refute the clear evidence put\n\nforward by Liberty Mutual showing that it was poor insurance sales,\n\nand not disability, that constituted the real reason for Tobin's\n\ntermination.     Second, he must advance evidence of his own showing\n\nthat   Liberty   Mutual's   asserted    reason   was   a   pretext   hiding\n\ndiscrimination.    See Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 824\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (stating that \"[i]t is not enough for a plaintiff\n\nmerely to impugn the veracity of the employer's justification; he\n\nmust elucidate specific facts which would enable a jury to find\n\n\n\nexplicitly raise an issue before the district court forecloses that\nparty from raising the issue for the first time on appeal'\")\n(quoting Boston Beer Co. Ltd. P'ship v. Sleser Bros. Brewing Co.,\nInc., 9 F.3d 175, 180 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Slade, 980\nF.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthat the reason given is not only a sham, but a sham intended to\n\ncover   up    the    employer's     real     motive\"   (internal    quotations\n\nomitted)).\n\n             Tobin, however, fails to clear either of these hurdles.\n\nWith regard to the evidence produced by Liberty Mutual, the company\n\nprovided     a   full    and      well-documented      account     of    Tobin's\n\n\"longstanding       performance    deficiencies.\"        As   Liberty     Mutual\n\nrecounts, Tobin failed to meet minimum quotas and standards; he did\n\nnot show up for meetings with supervisors; and his performance\n\nreviews were poor.      Tobin has done nothing to show that this cited\n\nevidence is false.\n\n             Moreover, Tobin has produced no evidence of his own to\n\nprove that Liberty Mutual's asserted reason was merely a pretext to\n\ndisguise discrimination.       Although he does cite to several company\n\ndocuments -- e-mails and a list enumerating the measures the\n\ncompany took in order to assist Tobin -- in an attempt to show\n\ndiscriminatory action on the part of the company, these documents\n\npre-date Tobin's December 1997 disclosure of his disability to\n\ncompany officials. At the time of the drafting of these documents,\n\nin September and October 1997, people at the company did not even\n\nknow that Tobin suffered from any sort of disability.                   As such,\n\nthese documents cannot serve to show any malice or discriminatory\n\nanimus by Liberty Mutual.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f            Similarly, Tobin attempts to show that Liberty Mutual's\n\nasserted reason was mere pretext by pointing to the fact that\n\nseveral employees who were \"similarly situated\" to him were given\n\nMM accounts -- an opportunity that was withheld from him.               Tobin,\n\nhowever, fails to provide specific evidence showing that these\n\nother employees were indeed similarly situated to him. See Perkins\n\nv. Brigham & Women's Hosp., 78 F.3d 747, 751 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(stating that a \"claim of disparate treatment based on comparative\n\nevidence must rest on proof that the proposed analogue is similarly\n\nsituated in material respects\").               In fact, there is significant\n\nevidence in the record to show that Tobin and these employees were\n\nnot similarly situated.         For example, one of the employees, Herb\n\nSchneiderman, had improved his performance over time at the company\n\nand   was   noted   for   his   \"good    improvement    in   his   outlook   and\n\nattitude.\" Tobin, in comparison, was constantly criticized for his\n\nperformance, his organization, and for his inability to follow the\n\ndirections of his managers.        As we cannot conclude that there was\n\nany evidence here that Tobin was a victim of disparate treatment,\n\nwe cannot find any evidence in the record to support Tobin's claim\n\nthat Liberty Mutual's decision to terminate his employment was not\n\nbased on the company's proferred grounds.              For these reasons, we\n\nhold that the district court was correct in granting summary\n\njudgment on Tobin's disability discrimination claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fB.    Failure to Accommodate Claim\n\n            Tobin's second claim arises under both the ADA and\n\nChapter 151B.      Under the ADA, employers are required to provide\n\nreasonable accommodation to an otherwise qualified applicant or\n\nemployee with a disability, unless the employer can demonstrate\n\nthat the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the\n\nemployer's business.      42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) (2000).4        Here,\n\nTobin sought two accommodations in particular from Liberty Mutual:\n\n(1)   assignment    of   MM   accounts;   and   (2)   additional   service\n\nrepresentative assistance.        The district court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of Liberty Mutual on this claim.\n\n            Looking primarily to Tobin's request for MM accounts, we\n\nthink that this grant of summary judgment was improper. To survive\n\nsummary judgment on his \"reasonable accommodation\" claim, Tobin had\n\nto produce enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find that (1)\n\nhe was disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2) he was able to\n\nperform the essential functions of the job with or without a\n\nreasonable accommodation, and (3) Liberty Mutual, despite knowing\n\n\n4\n    Section 102(a) of the ADA states: \"No covered entity shall\ndiscriminate against a qualified individual with a disability\nbecause of the disability of such individual in regard to . . .\nterms, conditions, and privileges of employment . . . .\" 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12112(a) (2000). Discrimination includes \"not making reasonable\naccommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an\notherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an\napplicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate\nthat the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the\noperation of the business of such covered entity.\"       42 U.S.C.\n§ 12112(b)(5)(A) (2000).\n\n                                   -13-\n\fof his disability, did not reasonably accommodate it.               Estades-\n\nNegroni v. Associates Corp. of North America, 377 F.3d 58, 63 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n           Tobin presented sufficient evidence on the first and\n\nthird prongs to survive summary judgment.             See Tobin, 2004 WL\n\n1922133 at *4, 10 (noting that \"[t]o be sure, Tobin's disability is\n\ngrounds   for   accommodation   under    the   ADA\"   and   that   Tobin   had\n\nrequested but was refused an MM account as an accommodation for his\n\ndisability).    It was the second prong of the test that the district\n\ncourt based summary judgment on -- and a conclusion that allowing\n\nTobin access to MM accounts would have altered his job requirements\n\nand hence the essential functions of his employment.           The district\n\ncourt wrote:\n\n           I find that summary judgment is warranted\n           because the assignment of mass marketing\n           accounts is not tied to Tobin's disability\n           . . . Tobin has introduced no evidence as to\n           how the assignment of mass marketing accounts\n           would    have    addressed     the     particular\n           deficiencies   created    by    his    particular\n           disability . . . [M]ore mass marketing\n           accounts would likely have led to increased\n           sales for any sales representative, whether\n           disabled or not . . . Assignment of mass\n           marketing accounts would, therefore, have been\n           functionally   equivalent    to    altering   job\n           performance requirements and quotas, which the\n           ADA does not require of employers.\n\n\nTobin, 2004 WL 1922133 at *10.5\n\n5\n   In Calef v. Gillette Co., 322 F.3d 75 (1st Cir. 2003), we wrote\nthat \"[a]n employer has no duty to modify an essential function of\na job. If the plaintiff . . . cannot perform an essential function\n\n                                  -14-\n\f           Immediately prior to this excerpted passage, however, the\n\ndistrict court had concluded -- and we agree -- that there was a\n\ntriable issue of fact as to whether access to MM accounts would\n\nhave   altered   the    nature   of     Tobin's   job    requirements      and   the\n\nessential functions of his employment.               See Tobin, 2004 WL 1922133\n\nat *9 (\"The evidence indicates that Schwitters used a number of\n\nsubjective factors in assigning mass marketing accounts that had\n\nnothing to do with 'prospecting.' . . . Liberty Mutual has made no\n\nshowing that assigning Tobin a mass marketing account . . . would\n\nhave created an 'undue hardship.'\").\n\n           We    have    noted   that    many   of    our   cases    on   essential\n\nfunction   and    reasonable      accommodation         have   \"turned     on    the\n\nsurprising failure of one party or the other to proffer any\n\nsignificant evidence in favor of their position.\"                   Reed v. LePage\n\nBakeries, 244 F.3d 254, 260 (1st Cir. 2001).                That is exactly the\n\nsituation here.         Despite its burden to come forward with some\n\nevidence on the essential function issue, see Ward v. Massachusetts\n\nHealth Research Inst., Inc., 209 F.3d 29, 35 (2000), Liberty Mutual\n\nhas failed to point to any evidence in the record that awarding\n\nTobin an MM account would change the essential function of his job.\n\n           Liberty Mutual asserts on appeal, as it did before the\n\ndistrict court, that accommodating Tobin with an MM account would\n\nhave forced the company \"to ignore its own performance standards.\"\n\n\nof the job, then he is not a qualified individual [under the ADA]\nand there is no duty to accommodate.\" Id. at 86 n.8.\n\n                                        -15-\n\fHowever, as the district court concluded, there was a disputed\n\nissue of fact as to how MM accounts were assigned.             Tobin pointed\n\nto evidence demonstrating that supervisors at the company had used\n\na number of subjective factors in assigning MM accounts.6               Tobin\n\nalso offered evidence that he was the only sales representative in\n\nthe office who was expected to meet his sales quotas by prospecting\n\nfor sales outside of MM accounts.           Given the outstanding material\n\nissue of fact as to how MM accounts were assigned, and, ultimately,\n\nas to the nature of Tobin's essential job requirements, we simply\n\ndo not see how the district court could have concluded on a summary\n\njudgment standard that accommodating Tobin with an MM account would\n\nhave altered those job requirements.\n\n          We do not suggest that Liberty Mutual was required to\n\naccommodate   Tobin   in   a   way   that    would   have   altered   his   job\n\nfunctions.    See Calef, 322 F.3d at 86 n.8.          If this case goes to\n\ntrial, Liberty Mutual can attempt to prove that Tobin's failure to\n\nmake sales outside of MM accounts constituted a failure to fulfil\n\nan essential function of the job.           If the company does so, it will\n\nprevail after all.    Similarly, Liberty Mutual can attempt to prove\n\nthat Tobin could not have done his job even if he were given access\n\n6\n   That Schneiderman was given an MM account even though he was\ndeficient in sales performance did not constitute evidence that\nTobin was a victim of pretext, because Tobin failed to refute\nLiberty Mutual's evidence that the company's motives for\nSchneiderman's treatment were non-discriminatory.  On the other\nhand, Schneiderman's treatment does undermine Liberty Mutual's\nassertion that MM accounts were assigned according to sales\nperformance.\n\n                                     -16-\n\fto an MM account, or that Tobin was not actually disabled under the\n\nADA.   But the evidence in Tobin's favor prevents us from granting\n\nsummary judgment on any of these grounds.   We therefore vacate the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment on this claim and remand\n\nthe issue to the district court for further proceedings.\n\nC.   Failure to Engage in Interactive Process Claim7\n\n           Tobin's final claim is that Liberty Mutual failed to\n\nengage in an \"interactive process\" with him to identify other\n\nappropriate accommodations.   The ADA's regulations state that \"it\n\nmay be necessary for the covered entity [the employer] to initiate\n\nan informal, interactive process with the qualified individual [the\n\nemployee] with a disability in need of the accommodation.\"       29\n\nC.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3) (2005).8     Thus, once the employer becomes\n\naware of the disability of an employee, he is expected to engage in\n\na meaningful dialogue with the employee to find the best means of\n\naccommodating that disability.    The district court determined that\n\n\n7\n   We recognize that Tobin's \"interactive process\" claim is a\nsubsidiary theory of his \"reasonable accommodation\" argument.\nInteractive process, after all, is the first step in a proper\nresponse to a disabled employee's request for reasonable\naccommodation. It is a means of ensuring that employers take steps\nto   understand  and   address  their   employees'   disabilities.\nNevertheless, we treat Tobin's \"interactive process\" claim here\nseparately because the parties briefed the issue separately and\nbecause we believe that it is possible for an employer to satisfy\nits duty to engage in \"interactive process\" yet still fail to\nprovide \"reasonable accommodation\" to a disabled employee.\n8\n    State law imposes a similar requirement to engage in an\n\"interactive process.\"   See Russell v. Cooley Dickinson Hosp.,\nInc., 772 N.E.2d 1054, 1065 (Mass. 2002).\n\n                                 -17-\n\fTobin did not produce sufficient evidence to support his claim that\n\nLiberty Mutual failed to engage in an \"interactive process\" with\n\nhim.\n\n            In Calero-Cerezo v. Dep't of Justice, we noted that\n\n\"[t]he scope of the employer's obligation in this [interactive]\n\nprocess is not crystal clear.\"             355 F.3d 6, 23-24 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nAlthough    an    \"employee's       request    for   reasonable   accommodation\n\nrequires a great deal of communication between the employee and\n\nemployer,\" Criado v. IBM Corp., 145 F.3d 437, 444 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(internal       quotation   marks    and    citation   omitted)   --   something\n\nespecially true in cases such as this one, involving an employee\n\nsuffering from mental illness, see id. -- this does not mean that\n\nthe employer has the unreasonable burden of raising and discussing\n\nevery conceivable accommodation with the disabled employee. As the\n\nADA regulations themselves state, the \"interactive process\" is to\n\nbe \"informal\" and a means of uncovering \"potential reasonable\n\naccommodations\" that could overcome the employee's disability.                 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3) (2005) (emphasis added).\n\n            The facts of this case illustrate well the need to\n\nemphasize the employer's limited and carefully-defined role.                 This\n\nis   not   an    instance   where    the    employer   Liberty    Mutual   simply\n\nrejected any request for accommodation without further discussion.\n\nSee García-Ayala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 648\n\nn.13 (1st Cir. 2000); see also Jacques v. Clean-Up Group, Inc., 96\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fF.3d 506, 515 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"There may well be situations in\n\nwhich the employer's failure to engage in an informal interactive\n\nprocess    would      constitute    a     failure     to    provide       reasonable\n\naccommodation that amounts to a violation of the ADA.\").                         Here,\n\nthere was not only a great deal of discussion about Tobin's\n\ndifficulties,      but   significant      action    on     the   part    of    company\n\nofficials.         Liberty      Mutual     provided      Tobin     with       multiple\n\naccommodations.       The district court noted that \"[t]he record is\n\nfilled with evidence of accommodations Liberty Mutual made for\n\nTobin, including the provision of a nurse, computer trainings, and\n\nnumerous meetings to help Tobin create the skills and plans to\n\nincrease his sales effectiveness.\"              Tobin, 2004 WL 1922133 at *11.\n\nIt   is   hard   to   imagine    that     all    these   measures       were    simply\n\n\"inflicted upon\" Tobin without any input on his part.                     We believe\n\nthat Liberty Mutual followed the ADA regulations and that the steps\n\ntaken by the company were sufficient to satisfy its obligation to\n\nengage in an \"interactive process.\"                 We therefore affirm the\n\ndistrict court's holding on Tobin's \"interactive process\" claim.\n\n                                         III.\n\n            For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the order of\n\nthe district court regarding Tobin's \"failure to accommodate\" claim\n\nand remand that issue for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.     The judgment of the district court is affirmed as to\n\n\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fTobin's   \"disability   discrimination\"   and   \"interactive   process\"\n\nclaims.\n\n           Affirmed in part, and vacated and remanded in part. Each\n\nparty to bear its own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n                        \"Concurrence follows.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f             HOWARD, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and concurring\n\nin the judgment.      I agree with the lead opinion's resolution of\n\nTobin's discrimination and \"interactive process\" claims.             I also\n\nagree with the result reached on the reasonable accommodation\n\nclaim.     I write separately, however, to address what I perceive to\n\nbe   the   district   court's   reason    for   granting   Liberty   Mutual\n\n(Liberty) summary judgment on the reasonable accommodation claim.\n\n             The lead opinion rejects the district court's reasonable\n\naccommodation ruling because there were disputed facts about the\n\nmethod by which Liberty assigned employees to mass marketing\n\naccounts.      Ante at 15.      Liberty presented evidence that such\n\nassignments were merit based, while Tobin presented evidence that\n\nLiberty used non-merit based factors to make these assignments.\n\nSee id.    This disputed fact relates to Liberty's claim that it was\n\nnot required to alter its assigning criteria as a reasonable\n\naccommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n\nBut, as I read the district court opinion, this is not the ground\n\non which summary judgment was granted.          Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins.\n\nCo., No. Civ. A-01-11979-DPW, 2004 WL 1922133, at *9 (D. Mass.\n\nAug. 30, 2004) (rejecting Liberty's summary judgment argument that\n\nit was not required to change its criteria for assigning mass\n\nmarketing accounts because it used merit-based criteria).\n\n             The   district     court    rejected    Tobin's   reasonable\n\naccommodation claim on the basis that assigning him to a mass\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fmarketing account would not have addressed the symptoms of his\n\nbipolar condition (i.e, inability to organize).         As the district\n\ncourt explained:\n\n              Tobin has introduced no evidence as to how the\n              assignment of mass marketing accounts would\n              have addressed the particular deficiencies\n              created by his particular disability. Indeed\n              . . . more mass marketing accounts would\n              likely have led to increased sales for any\n              sales representative whether disabled or not.\n              To be sure, Tobin's disability is grounds for\n              accommodation under the ADA, it does not\n              however, entitle him to any and every change\n              in work conditions that would improve his\n              performance. Rather, the accommodation must\n              be for the disability, and Tobin has nowhere\n              shown that assignment of mass marketing\n              accounts were reasonable accommodations for\n              his particular disability.\n\nTobin, 2004 WL 1922133, at *10.        I am not persuaded that the lead\n\nopinion's reliance on disputed facts related to Liberty's criteria\n\nfor selecting agents for mass marketing accounts is sufficiently\n\nresponsive to this reasoning.\n\n              Nevertheless, I agree that the district court's ruling\n\nwas erroneous.      The legal principle grounding the holding seems\n\nsound.    See Wood v. Crown Redi-Mix, Inc., 339 F.3d 682, 687 (8th\n\nCir.   2003    (\"Where   the   reasonable   accommodation   requested   is\n\nunrelated to the limitation, we do not believe an ADA action may\n\nlie.\").   The ADA's purpose is to provide a disabled employee with\n\na reasonable accommodation that will help the employee overcome the\n\nlimitation caused by his or her particular disability; it is not a\n\nstatute intended to provide benefits to an employee simply because\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fthe employee happens to be disabled.        See Felix v. N.Y. City\n\nTransit Auth., 324 F.3d 102, 107 (2d Cir. 2003) (\"The ADA mandates\n\nreasonable accommodation of people with disabilities in order to\n\nput them on an even playing field with the non-disabled; it does\n\nnot authorize a preference for disabled people generally.\").\n\n            Tobin has, however, generated sufficient record evidence\n\nto permit the conclusion that assigning him to a mass marketing\n\naccount would have assisted him in overcoming the particular\n\nlimitation caused by his bipolar disability.     Tobin's supervisor\n\ntestified that Tobin's biggest problem \"was identifying potential\n\nnew customers and going to see them\" but that \"he [did] a good job\n\nat closing the sale.\"     There was also evidence that, because mass\n\nmarketing accounts provide the assigned agent with a captive\n\naudience of potential clients, closing skills are more important\n\nthan business generation skills for agents assigned to these\n\naccounts.   On this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that\n\nassigning Tobin to a mass marketing account would have assisted him\n\nin   overcoming     his    disability-related   problem   of   being\n\ninsufficiently organized to identify and pursue new clients.    For\n\nthis reason, Tobin's reasonable accommodation claim should proceed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f",

Tobin appeals the award of summary judgment to his former employer, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\"Liberty Mutual\"), on his state and federal claims of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate, pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101, <i>et seq.</i> (2000), and the Massachusetts anti-discrimination statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B (\"Chapter 151B\"). Because we believe that summary judgment was improperly granted on Tobin's \"failure to accommodate\" claim, we vacate the district court's judgment on that claim. We affirm, however, the remainder of the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin was hired by Liberty Mutual on September 17, 1964 for an administrative position. In May 1968, he was promoted to sales representative, a position he held until his termination in January 2001. As a sales representative, Tobin was responsible for selling insurance, including automobile, home, and life insurance. He was also expected to assist in customer service and retain business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since 1976, Tobin has been under the regular care of a psychiatrist, mainly for treatment of bipolar disorder. This condition limited Tobin's focus and concentration, impaired his ability to prioritize and complete tasks, required that he have more time to finish his work, and affected his organizational skills. It was only in December 1997, however, that Tobin revealed his condition to officials at the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Tobin's Performance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Tobin had accumulated a large book of business over the years and the annual premiums generated from this book of business earned \"significant profits,\" Tobin's yearly new business sales were considered deficient beginning in 1992. For example, for the twelve-month period ending September 1993, Tobin had sold only 270 new policies &#8212; a significant shortfall given that the quota for new policy sales was set at 339. In his Sales Representative Appraisal for that year, on a scale from 1-6, with 1 being the highest, Tobin received a 6 in the \"Sales Rating\" category. His overall evaluation was a 5. In 1994-1996 and 1998, Tobin's appraisals reflect similar negative ratings and comments for sales, prospecting, performance, and overall performance, and positive ratings and comments for quality, loss ratio, and retention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1996, Tobin's supervisor, Mike Robin, gave Tobin a written warning stating that failure to meet the sales requirements for a thirty-day period would lead to a sixty-day probation followed by possible termination. Although Tobin did not meet the requirements for the thirty-day period, Liberty Mutual waived the probation because Tobin's wife was ill. On November 21, 1997, Robin placed Tobin on a nine-week warning period, emphasizing that new business sales were critical, as were participation in sales initiatives and refraining from \"inappropriate and insubordinate behavior in the office,\" including the use of profane language. Robin made clear that Tobin would face probation unless he brought his performance up to an acceptable level by demonstrating increased sales results and participating in sales initiatives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin then took two short-term disability leaves of absence. The first lasted from December 1997 until June 1998, and the second from September 1998 until January 1999. In both instances, Tobin's doctor, Dr. William Kantar, indicated that he had diagnosed Tobin as bipolar and that Tobin was significantly restricted as to interpersonal relations, as well as to occupational and social activities. Each time Tobin returned to work, Tobin's new supervisor, Manina Schwitters, gave Tobin a reduced work schedule for his first four weeks after he returned from leave. Each time, upon resumption of his full-time duties, Tobin's warning period was reinstated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Tobin returned to work the second time, in January 1999, Liberty Mutual hired a nurse, Cathy Harding, to assist him in resuming his position as a sales representative. After working reduced hours for four weeks, Tobin resumed his full-time duties on February 1, 1999. Tobin's supervisor extended the two weeks remaining from the November 1997 warning period to run for four weeks, from February 1 to February 26. Tobin failed to sell twenty-four new policies during the four-week warning period to avoid beginning a four-week probation period. However, during a meeting with several supervisors, Tobin produced several additional policies, which were accepted in order to meet the quota set for the warning period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter dated March 8, 1999, Schwitters indicated that she would monitor Tobin's sales results in four-week increments for the rest of the year beginning on March 1. At the end of the first increment, Schwitters notified Tobin he was being placed on probation for failing to meet the minimum sales requirements. The quota for the period had been twenty-four, and Tobin sold only ten. Tobin then successfully completed the five-week probationary period by selling the required thirty policies. Tobin's sales performance, however, deteriorated over the next several months, and he was again placed on probation on November 27, 2000. Tobin failed to sell the required thirty policies during this second probationary period and was terminated on January 10, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Mass Marketing Accounts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass Marketing accounts (\"MM accounts\") are group insurance discount programs offered to businesses and associations throughout the United States. The employees or association members who purchase insurance policies through MM accounts receive benefits such as discounted policy premiums, automatic deduction of premium payments from paychecks, and a waiver of finance and service charges. MM accounts provide sales representatives with access to employees of participating employers in workplace settings and thereby afford sales representatives exposure to a large volume of potential clients. These MM accounts are desirable to the sales representatives because they provide a good source for potential sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin says he repeatedly requested to be assigned MM accounts and to be provided with adequate sales support. He maintains that Liberty Mutual's failure to assign him MM accounts was both a denial of a reasonable accommodation and discriminatory pursuant to state and federal law. Tobin argues that but for the failure of Liberty Mutual to assign him MM accounts and to provide adequate sales support, he would have been able to meet the sales quotas set for him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties dispute whether assigning Tobin a MM account would have violated Liberty Mutual's policy for assigning such accounts. Liberty Mutual contends that the MM accounts were distributed on the basis of merit &#8212; given to those sales representatives who most actively took initiative to land new MM accounts &#8212; as well as according to workload. Tobin, however, contends that on at least one occasion Schwitters violated this policy by assigning an MM account to Herb Schneiderman, a sales representative with a substandard sales performance, and that Tobin could have likewise been assigned such accounts despite his below-quota sales. Liberty Mutual responds that Schwitter's assignments were not inconsistent because, unlike Tobin, Schneiderman at least took some initiative to open new MM accounts. Liberty Mutual further argues that, in any event, there is no evidence that Tobin would have been able to handle adequately such an account were it assigned to him or that he would have been able to meet the quotas, even with MM accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin now appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment for Liberty Mutual, arguing that the district court erred because (1) Liberty Mutual's explanation for Tobin's termination was pretextual, (2) there was a nexus between his disability and the requested accommodation of assignment of MM accounts, and (3) Liberty Mutual failed to engage in an \"interactive process\" to help accommodate Tobin's disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo, see, e.g., Guzm&#225;n-Rosario v. United Parcel Service, Inc.,</i> 397 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir.2005), and construe the record in the light most favorable to Tobin. <i>See United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Flores-Galarza,</i> 318 F.3d 323, 330 (1st Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Disability Discrimination Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating Tobin's disability discrimination claim under the ADA and Chapter 151B, we use the burden-shifting framework outlined by the Supreme Court in <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 252, 264 (1st Cir.1999) (approving use of <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework in connection with ADA claims of disability discrimination). Under this approach, Tobin must first establish a prima facie case by establishing that (1) he suffers from a disability or handicap, as defined by the ADA and Chapter 151B, that (2) he was nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of his job, either with or without reasonable accommodation, and that (3) Liberty Mutual took an adverse employment action against him because of, in whole or in part, his protected disability. <i>See McDonnell Douglas,</i> 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817; <i>Carroll v. Xerox Corp.,</i> 294 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Benoit v. Technical Mfg. Corp.,</i> 331 F.3d 166, 175 (1st Cir.2003). If Tobin is able to do this, the burden then shifts to Liberty Mutual to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its employment decision and to produce credible evidence to show that the reason advanced was the real reason. <i>McDonnell Douglas,</i> 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. Finally, if Liberty Mutual offers such a reason, the burden shifts back to Tobin, and he must proffer evidence to establish that Liberty Mutual's non-discriminatory justification is mere pretext, cloaking discriminatory animus. <i>Id.</i> at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817. The ultimate burden of proving unlawful discrimination rests at all times with Tobin. <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod., Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, it is undisputed that Tobin has established a prima facie case and that Liberty Mutual has advanced a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its employment decision. The issue in dispute here is whether Liberty Mutual's asserted reason was pretextual &#8212; i.e., that the reason was advanced merely to disguise Liberty Mutual's real reason for terminating Tobin's employment, his disability. \"In assessing pretext, the court must look at the total package of proof offered by the plaintiff.\" <i>Benoit,</i> 331 F.3d at 174.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin argues that Liberty Mutual's proffered reason is indeed a pretext and that he was fired because of his disability. Tobin, however, has to clear two significant hurdles before he is able to show pretext. First, he must refute the clear evidence put forward by Liberty Mutual showing that it was poor insurance sales, and not disability, that constituted the real reason for Tobin's termination. Second, he must advance evidence of his own showing that Liberty Mutual's asserted reason was a pretext hiding discrimination. <i>See Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 824 (1st Cir.1991) (stating that \"[i]t is not enough for a plaintiff merely to impugn the veracity of the employer's justification; he must elucidate specific facts which would enable a jury to find that the reason given is not only a sham, but a sham intended to cover up the employer's real motive\" (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin, however, fails to clear either of these hurdles. With regard to the evidence produced by Liberty Mutual, the company provided a full and well-documented account of Tobin's \"longstanding performance deficiencies.\" As Liberty Mutual recounts, Tobin failed to meet minimum quotas and standards; he did not show up for meetings with supervisors; and his performance reviews were poor. Tobin has done nothing to show that this cited evidence is false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Tobin has produced no evidence of his own to prove that Liberty Mutual's asserted reason was merely a pretext to disguise discrimination. Although he does cite to several company documents &#8212; e-mails and a list enumerating the measures the company took in order to assist Tobin &#8212; in an attempt to show discriminatory action on the part of the company, these documents pre-date Tobin's December 1997 disclosure of his disability to company officials. At the time of the drafting of these documents, in September and October 1997, people at the company did not even know that Tobin suffered from any sort of disability. As such, these documents cannot serve to show any malice or discriminatory animus by Liberty Mutual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Tobin attempts to show that Liberty Mutual's asserted reason was mere pretext by pointing to the fact that several employees who were \"similarly situated\" to him were given MM accounts &#8212; an opportunity that was withheld from him. Tobin, however, fails to provide specific evidence showing that these other employees were indeed similarly situated to him. <i>See Perkins v. Brigham &amp; Women's Hosp.,</i> 78 F.3d 747, 751 (1st Cir.1996) (stating that a \"claim of disparate treatment based on comparative evidence must rest on proof that the proposed analogue is similarly situated in material respects\"). In fact, there is significant evidence in the record to show that Tobin and these employees were not similarly situated. For example, one of the employees, Herb Schneiderman, had improved his performance over time at the company and was noted for his \"good improvement in his outlook and attitude.\" Tobin, in comparison, was constantly criticized for his performance, his organization, and for his inability to follow the directions of his managers. As we cannot conclude that there was any evidence here that Tobin was a victim of disparate treatment, we cannot find any evidence in the record to support Tobin's claim that Liberty Mutual's decision to terminate his employment was not based on the company's proferred grounds. For these reasons, we hold that the district court was correct in granting summary judgment on Tobin's disability discrimination claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Failure to Accommodate Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin's second claim arises under both the ADA and Chapter 151B. Under the ADA, employers are required to provide reasonable accommodation to an otherwise qualified applicant or employee with a disability, unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer's business. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(b)(5)(A) (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Here, Tobin sought two accommodations in particular from Liberty Mutual: (1) assignment of MM accounts; and (2) additional service representative assistance. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Liberty Mutual on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking primarily to the district court's examination of Tobin's request for MM accounts, we think that this grant of summary judgment was improper. To survive summary judgment on his \"reasonable accommodation\" claim, Tobin had to produce enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find that (1) he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2) he was able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation, and (3) Liberty Mutual, despite knowing of his disability, did not reasonably accommodate it. <i>Estades-Negroni v. Associates Corp. of North America,</i> 377 F.3d 58, 63 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems that the district court concluded that Tobin had presented sufficient evidence on the first and third prongs to survive summary judgment. <i>See, e.g., Tobin,</i> 2004 WL 1922133 at *4, 10 (noting that \"[t]o be sure, Tobin's disability is grounds for accommodation under the ADA\" and that Tobin had requested but was refused an MM account as an accommodation for his disability). It was the second prong of the test that the district court based summary judgment on &#8212; and a conclusion that allowing Tobin access to MM accounts would have altered his job requirements and hence the essential functions of his employment. The district court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find that summary judgment is warranted because the assignment of mass marketing accounts is not tied to Tobin's disability... Tobin has introduced no evidence as to how the assignment of mass marketing accounts would have addressed the particular deficiencies created by his particular disability ... [M]ore mass marketing accounts would likely have led to increased sales for <i>any</i> sales representative, whether disabled or not ... Assignment of mass marketing accounts would, therefore, have been functionally equivalent to altering job performance requirements and quotas, which the ADA does not require of employers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\"><i>Tobin,</i> 2004 WL 1922133 at *10.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately prior to this excerpted passage, however, the district court had concluded that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether access to MM accounts would have altered the nature of Tobin's job requirements and the essential functions of his employment. Although Liberty Mutual had argued that awarding Tobin an MM account would change the essential function of his job by requiring the company \"to ignore its own performance standards,\" the district court found this assertion unproved for summary judgment purposes, noting that there was a disputed issue of fact as to how MM accounts were assigned. Tobin had argued that the MM accounts were not assigned solely according to merit and had pointed to evidence demonstrating that supervisors at the company had used a number of subjective factors in assigning MM accounts. Given this outstanding material issue of fact as to Tobin's essential job requirements, we simply do not see how the district court could have concluded on a summary judgment standard that accommodating Tobin with an MM account would have altered those job requirements. We therefore vacate the district court's grant of summary judgment on this claim and remand the issue to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Failure to Engage in Interactive Process Claim<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin's final claim is that Liberty Mutual failed to engage in an \"interactive process\" with him to identify other appropriate accommodations. The ADA's regulations state that \"it may be necessary for the covered entity [the employer] to initiate an informal, interactive process with the qualified individual [the employee] with a disability in need of the accommodation.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(<i>o</i>)(3) (2005).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Thus, once the employer becomes aware of the disability of an employee, he is expected to engage in a meaningful dialogue with the employee to find the best means of accommodating that disability. The district court determined that Tobin did not produce sufficient evidence to support his claim that Liberty Mutual failed to engage in an \"interactive process\" with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Calero-Cerezo v. Dep't of Justice,</i> we noted that \"[t]he scope of the employer's obligation in this [interactive] process is not crystal clear.\" 355 F.3d 6, 23-24 (1st Cir.2004). Although an \"employee's request for reasonable accommodation requires a great deal of communication between the employee and employer,\" <i>Criado v. IBM Corp.,</i> 145 F.3d 437, 444 (1st Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) &#8212; something especially true in cases such as this one, involving an employee suffering from mental illness, <i>see id.</i> &#8212; this does not mean that the employer has the unreasonable burden of raising and discussing every conceivable accommodation with the disabled employee. As the ADA regulations themselves state, the \"interactive process\" is to be \"informal\" and a means of uncovering \"<i>potential</i> reasonable accommodations\" that could overcome the employee's disability. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(<i>o</i>)(3) (2005) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case illustrate well the need to emphasize the employer's limited and carefully-defined role. This is not an instance where the employer Liberty Mutual simply rejected any request for accommodation without further discussion. <i>See Garc&#237;a-Ayala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc.,</i> 212 F.3d 638, 648 n. 13 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see also Jacques v. Clean-Up Group, Inc.,</i> 96 F.3d 506, 515 (1st Cir.1996) (\"There may well be situations in which the employer's failure to engage in an informal interactive process would constitute a failure to provide reasonable accommodation that amounts to a violation of the ADA.\"). Here, there was not only a great deal of discussion about Tobin's difficulties, but significant action on the part of company officials. Liberty Mutual provided Tobin with multiple accommodations. The district court noted that \"[t]he record is filled with evidence of accommodations Liberty Mutual made for Tobin, including the provision of a nurse, computer trainings, and numerous meetings to help Tobin create the skills and plans to increase his sales effectiveness.\" <i>Tobin,</i> 2004 WL 1922133 at *11. It is hard to imagine that all these measures were simply \"inflicted upon\" Tobin without any input on his part. We believe that Liberty Mutual followed the ADA regulations and that the steps taken by the company were sufficient to satisfy its obligation to engage in an \"interactive process.\" We therefore affirm the district court's holding on Tobin's \"interactive process\" claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the order of the district court regarding Tobin's \"failure to accommodate\" claim and remand that issue for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Liberty Mutual Ins. Co.,</i> No. Civ.A.01-11979-DPW, 2004 WL 1922133 at *6 n. 9 (D.Mass. Aug.30, 2004). We note, however, that the standards under the ADA and Chapter 151B occasionally differ in ways that are relevant to this case. <i>See, e.g., Dahill v. Police Dep't of Boston,</i> 434 Mass. 233, 748 N.E.2d 956 (2001) (rejecting, for the purposes of Chapter 151B, the federal rule that mitigating or corrective devices must be considered in determining whether an individual is disabled). Here, we do not emphasize these differences, as the parties before the district court already stipulated that \"state and federal disability law are in accord\" for the purposes of this case. For this reason, throughout the remainder of this opinion, we frame our discussion primarily in terms of the ADA and federal case law, as the district court did.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> An alternative framework involves \"mixed-motive\" analysis, as established by the Supreme Court in<i>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,</i> 490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989). Mixed-motive analysis is appropriate where evidence exists that an employer considered both a proscribed factor (for example, race or disability) and one or more legitimate factors (for example, competence) in making an adverse employment decision. <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> 490 U.S. at 241-242, 109 S.Ct. 1775; <i>Fern&#225;ndes v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc.,</i> 199 F.3d 572, 580 (1st Cir.1999). We believe that in this instance \"mixed-motive\" analysis is inapplicable. This is because Tobin raises the issue of the use of \"mixed-motive\" analysis for the first time on appeal. Contrary to Tobin's claim that he made \"implicit reference\" to a mixed-motive argument in the district court, Tobin never argued below that his claims should be analyzed under a mixed-motive framework. As the district court stated, \"neither party here disputes that the pretext model [as opposed to a mixed-motive model] is the proper mode of analysis for this case.\" <i>Tobin,</i> 2004 WL 1922133 at *6 n. 10.

Indeed... more mass marketing accounts would likely have led to increased sales for <i>any</i> sales representative whether disabled or not. To be sure, Tobin's disability is grounds for accommodation under the ADA, it does not however, entitle him to any and every change in work conditions that would improve his performance. Rather, the accommodation must be <i>for</i> the disability, and Tobin has nowhere shown that assignment of mass marketing accounts were reasonable accommodations for his particular disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Tobin,</i> 2004 WL 1922133, at *10. I am not persuaded that the lead opinion's reliance on disputed facts related to Liberty's criteria for selecting agents for mass marketing accounts is sufficiently responsive to this reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, I agree that the district court's ruling was erroneous. The legal principle grounding the holding seems sound. <i>See Wood v. Crown Redi-Mix, Inc.,</i> 339 F.3d 682, 687 (8th Cir.2003) (\"Where the reasonable accommodation requested is unrelated to the limitation, we do not believe an ADA action may lie.\"). The ADA's purpose is to provide a disabled employee with a reasonable accommodation that will help the employee overcome the limitation caused by his or her particular disability; it is not a statute intended to provide benefits to an employee simply because the employee happens to be disabled. <i>See Felix v. N.Y. City Transit Auth.,</i> 324 F.3d 102, 107 (2d Cir.2003) (\"The ADA mandates reasonable accommodation of people with disabilities in order to put them on an even playing field with the non-disabled; it does not authorize a preference for disabled people generally.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin has, however, generated sufficient record evidence to permit the conclusion that assigning him to a mass marketing account would have assisted him in overcoming the particular limitation caused by his bipolar disability. Tobin's supervisor testified that Tobin's biggest problem \"was identifying potential new customers and going to see them\" but that \"he [did] a good job at closing the sale.\" There was also evidence that, because mass marketing accounts provide the assigned agent with a captive audience of potential clients, closing skills are more important than business generation skills for agents assigned to these accounts. On this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that assigning Tobin to a mass marketing account would have assisted him in overcoming his disability-related problem of being insufficiently organized to identify and pursue new clients. For this reason, Tobin's reasonable accommodation claim should proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Tobin appeals the award of summary judgment to his former employer, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\"Liberty Mutual\"), on his state and federal claims of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate, pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101, <i>et seq.</i> (2000), and the Massachusetts anti-discrimination statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B (\"Chapter 151B\"). Because we believe that summary judgment was improperly granted on Tobin's \"failure to accommodate\" claim, we vacate the district court's judgment on that claim. We affirm, however, the remainder of the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin was hired by Liberty Mutual on September 17, 1964 for an administrative position. In May 1968, he was promoted to sales representative, a position he held until his termination in January 2001. As a sales representative, Tobin was responsible for selling insurance, including automobile, home, and life insurance. He was also expected to assist in customer service and retain business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since 1976, Tobin has been under the regular care of a psychiatrist, mainly for treatment of bipolar disorder. This condition limited Tobin's focus and concentration, impaired his ability to prioritize and complete tasks, required that he have more time to finish his work, and affected his organizational skills. It was only in December 1997, however, that Tobin revealed his condition to officials at the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Tobin's Performance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Tobin had accumulated a large book of business over the years and the annual premiums generated from this book of business earned \"significant profits,\" Tobin's yearly new business sales were considered deficient beginning in 1992. For example, for the twelve-month period ending September 1993, Tobin had sold only 270 new policies &#8212; a significant shortfall given that the quota for new policy sales was set at 339. In his Sales Representative Appraisal for that year, on a scale from 1-6, with 1 being the highest, Tobin received a 6 in the \"Sales Rating\" category. His overall evaluation was a 5. In 1994-1996 and 1998, Tobin's appraisals reflect similar negative ratings and comments for sales, prospecting, performance, and overall performance, and positive ratings and comments for quality, loss ratio, and retention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1996, Tobin's supervisor, Mike Robin, gave Tobin a written warning stating that failure to meet the sales requirements for a thirty-day period would lead to a sixty-day probation followed by possible termination. Although Tobin did not meet the requirements for the thirty-day period, Liberty Mutual waived the probation because Tobin's wife was ill. On November 21, 1997, Robin placed Tobin on a nine-week warning period, emphasizing that new business sales were critical, as were participation in sales initiatives and refraining from \"inappropriate and insubordinate behavior in the office,\" including the use of profane language. Robin made clear that Tobin would face probation unless he brought his performance up to an acceptable level by demonstrating increased sales results and participating in sales initiatives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin then took two short-term disability leaves of absence. The first lasted from December 1997 until June 1998, and the second from September 1998 until January 1999. In both instances, Tobin's doctor, Dr. William Kantar, indicated that he had diagnosed Tobin as bipolar and that Tobin was significantly restricted as to interpersonal relations, as well as to occupational and social activities. Each time Tobin returned to work, Tobin's new supervisor, Manina Schwitters, gave Tobin a reduced work schedule for his first four weeks after he returned from leave. Each time, upon resumption of his full-time duties, Tobin's warning period was reinstated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Tobin returned to work the second time, in January 1999, Liberty Mutual hired a nurse, Cathy Harding, to assist him in resuming his position as a sales representative. After working reduced hours for four weeks, Tobin resumed his full-time duties on February 1, 1999. Tobin's supervisor extended the two weeks remaining from the November 1997 warning period to run for four weeks, from February 1 to February 26. Tobin failed to sell twenty-four new policies during the four-week warning period to avoid beginning a four-week probation period. However, during a meeting with several supervisors, Tobin produced several additional policies, which were accepted in order to meet the quota set for the warning period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter dated March 8, 1999, Schwitters indicated that she would monitor Tobin's sales results in four-week increments for the rest of the year beginning on March 1. At the end of the first increment, Schwitters notified Tobin he was being placed on probation for failing to meet the minimum sales requirements. The quota for the period had been twenty-four, and Tobin sold only ten. Tobin then successfully completed the five-week probationary period by selling the required thirty policies. Tobin's sales performance, however, deteriorated over the next several months, and he was again placed on probation on November 27, 2000. Tobin failed to sell the required thirty policies during this second probationary period and was terminated on January 10, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Mass Marketing Accounts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass Marketing accounts (\"MM accounts\") are group insurance discount programs offered to businesses and associations throughout the United States. The employees or association members who purchase insurance policies through MM accounts receive benefits such as discounted policy premiums, automatic deduction of premium payments from paychecks, and a waiver of finance and service charges. MM accounts provide sales representatives with access to employees of participating employers in workplace settings and thereby afford sales representatives exposure to a large volume of potential clients. These MM accounts are desirable to the sales representatives because they provide a good source for potential sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin says he repeatedly requested to be assigned MM accounts and to be provided with adequate sales support. He maintains that Liberty Mutual's failure to assign him MM accounts was both a denial of a reasonable accommodation and discriminatory pursuant to state and federal law. Tobin argues that but for the failure of Liberty Mutual to assign him MM accounts and to provide adequate sales support, he would have been able to meet the sales quotas set for him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties dispute whether assigning Tobin a MM account would have violated Liberty Mutual's policy for assigning such accounts. Liberty Mutual contends that the MM accounts were distributed on the basis of merit &#8212; given to those sales representatives who most actively took initiative to land new MM accounts &#8212; as well as according to workload. Tobin, however, contends that on at least one occasion Schwitters violated this policy by assigning an MM account to Herb Schneiderman, a sales representative with a substandard sales performance, and that Tobin could have likewise been assigned such accounts despite his below-quota sales. Liberty Mutual responds that Schwitter's assignments were not inconsistent because, unlike Tobin, Schneiderman at least took some initiative to open new MM accounts. Liberty Mutual further argues that, in any event, there is no evidence that Tobin would have been able to handle adequately such an account were it assigned to him or that he would have been able to meet the quotas, even with MM accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin now appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment for Liberty Mutual, arguing that the district court erred because (1) Liberty Mutual's explanation for Tobin's termination was pretextual, (2) there was a nexus between his disability and the requested accommodation of assignment of MM accounts, and (3) Liberty Mutual failed to engage in an \"interactive process\" to help accommodate Tobin's disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo, see, e.g., Guzm&#225;n-Rosario v.

Under this approach, Tobin must first establish a prima facie case by establishing that (1) he suffers from a disability or handicap, as defined by the ADA and Chapter 151B, that (2) he was nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of his job, either with or without reasonable accommodation, and that (3) Liberty Mutual took an adverse employment action against him because of, in whole or in part, his protected disability. <i>See McDonnell Douglas,</i> 411 U.S. at 802, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If Tobin is able to do this, the burden then shifts to Liberty Mutual to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its employment decision and to produce credible evidence to show that the reason advanced was the real reason. <i>McDonnell Douglas,</i> 411 U.S. at 802, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Finally, if Liberty Mutual offers such a reason, the burden shifts back to Tobin, and he must proffer evidence to establish that Liberty Mutual's non-discriminatory justification is mere pretext, cloaking discriminatory animus. <i>Id.</i> at 804, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The issue in dispute here is whether Liberty Mutual's asserted reason was pretextual &#8212; i.e., that the reason was advanced merely to disguise Liberty Mutual's real reason for terminating Tobin's employment, his disability. \"In assessing pretext, the court must look at the total package of proof offered by the plaintiff.\" <i>Benoit,</i> 331 F.3d at 174.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin argues that Liberty Mutual's proffered reason is indeed a pretext and that he was fired because of his disability. Tobin, however, has to clear two significant hurdles before he is able to show pretext. First, he must refute the clear evidence put forward by Liberty Mutual showing that it was poor insurance sales, and not disability, that constituted the real reason for Tobin's termination. Second, he must advance evidence of his own showing that Liberty Mutual's asserted reason was a pretext hiding discrimination. <i>See Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 824 (1st Cir.1991) (stating that \"[i]t is not enough for a plaintiff merely to impugn the veracity of the employer's justification; he must elucidate specific facts which would enable a jury to find that the reason given is not only a sham, but a sham intended to cover up the employer's real motive\" (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin, however, fails to clear either of these hurdles. With regard to the evidence produced by Liberty Mutual, the company provided a full and well-documented account of Tobin's \"longstanding performance deficiencies.\" As Liberty Mutual recounts, Tobin failed to meet minimum quotas and standards; he did not show up for meetings with supervisors; and his performance reviews were poor. Tobin has done nothing to show that this cited evidence is false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Tobin has produced no evidence of his own to prove that Liberty Mutual's asserted reason was merely a pretext to disguise discrimination. Although he does cite to several company documents &#8212; e-mails and a list enumerating the measures the company took in order to assist Tobin &#8212; in an attempt to show discriminatory action on the part of the company, these documents pre-date Tobin's December 1997 disclosure of his disability to company officials. At the time of the drafting of these documents, in September and October 1997, people at the company did not even know that Tobin suffered from any sort of disability. As such, these documents cannot serve to show any malice or discriminatory animus by Liberty Mutual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Tobin attempts to show that Liberty Mutual's asserted reason was mere pretext by pointing to the fact that several employees who were \"similarly situated\" to him were given MM accounts &#8212; an opportunity that was withheld from him. Tobin, however, fails to provide specific evidence showing that these other employees were indeed similarly situated to him. <i>See Perkins v. Brigham &amp; Women's Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714796\"><a href=\"/opinion/714796/patrick-perkins-v-brigham-womens-hospital-and-george-h-kaye/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span>, 751 (1st Cir.1996) (stating that a \"claim of disparate treatment based on comparative evidence must rest on proof that the proposed analogue is similarly situated in material respects\"). In fact, there is significant evidence in the record to show that Tobin and these employees were not similarly situated. For example, one of the employees, Herb Schneiderman, had improved his performance over time at the company and was noted for his \"good improvement in his outlook and attitude.\" Tobin, in comparison, was constantly criticized for his performance, his organization, and for his inability to follow the directions of his managers. As we cannot conclude that there was any evidence here that Tobin was a victim of disparate treatment, we cannot find any evidence in the record to support Tobin's claim that Liberty Mutual's decision to terminate his employment was not based on the company's proferred grounds. For these reasons, we hold that the district court was correct in granting summary judgment on Tobin's disability discrimination claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Failure to Accommodate Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin's second claim arises under both the ADA and Chapter 151B. Under the ADA, employers are required to provide reasonable accommodation to an otherwise qualified applicant or employee with a disability, unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer's business. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(b)(5)(A) (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Here, Tobin sought two accommodations in particular from Liberty Mutual: (1) assignment of MM accounts; and (2) additional service representative assistance. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Liberty Mutual on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking primarily to the district court's examination of Tobin's request for MM accounts, we think that this grant of summary judgment was improper. To survive summary judgment on his \"reasonable accommodation\" claim, Tobin had to produce enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find that (1) he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2) he was able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation, and (3) Liberty Mutual, despite knowing of his disability, did not reasonably accommodate it. <i>Estades-Negroni v. Associates Corp. of North America,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></span>, 63 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems that the district court concluded that Tobin had presented sufficient evidence on the first and third prongs to survive summary judgment. <i>See, e.g., Tobin,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1922133</span></span> at *4, 10 (noting that \"[t]o be sure, Tobin's disability is grounds for accommodation under the ADA\" and that Tobin had requested but was refused an MM account as an accommodation for his disability). It was the second prong of the test that the district court based summary judgment on &#8212; and a conclusion that allowing Tobin access to MM accounts would have altered his job requirements and hence the essential functions of his employment. The district court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find that summary judgment is warranted because the assignment of mass marketing accounts is not tied to Tobin's disability... Tobin has introduced no evidence as to how the assignment of mass marketing accounts would have addressed the particular deficiencies created by his particular disability ... [M]ore mass marketing accounts would likely have led to increased sales for <i>any</i> sales representative, whether disabled or not ... Assignment of mass marketing accounts would, therefore, have been functionally equivalent to altering job performance requirements and quotas, which the ADA does not require of employers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\"><i>Tobin,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1922133</span></span> at *10.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately prior to this excerpted passage, however, the district court had concluded that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether access to MM accounts would have altered the nature of Tobin's job requirements and the essential functions of his employment. Although Liberty Mutual had argued that awarding Tobin an MM account would change the essential function of his job by requiring the company \"to ignore its own performance standards,\" the district court found this assertion unproved for summary judgment purposes, noting that there was a disputed issue of fact as to how MM accounts were assigned. Tobin had argued that the MM accounts were not assigned solely according to merit and had pointed to evidence demonstrating that supervisors at the company had used a number of subjective factors in assigning MM accounts. Given this outstanding material issue of fact as to Tobin's essential job requirements, we simply do not see how the district court could have concluded on a summary judgment standard that accommodating Tobin with an MM account would have altered those job requirements. We therefore vacate the district court's grant of summary judgment on this claim and remand the issue to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

The ADA's regulations state that \"it may be necessary for the covered entity [the employer] to initiate an informal, interactive process with the qualified individual [the employee] with a disability in need of the accommodation.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(<i>o</i>)(3) (2005).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Thus, once the employer becomes aware of the disability of an employee, he is expected to engage in a meaningful dialogue with the employee to find the best means of accommodating that disability. The district court determined that Tobin did not produce sufficient evidence to support his claim that Liberty Mutual failed to engage in an \"interactive process\" with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Calero-Cerezo v.

As the ADA regulations themselves state, the \"interactive process\" is to be \"informal\" and a means of uncovering \"<i>potential</i> reasonable accommodations\" that could overcome the employee's disability. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(<i>o</i>)(3) (2005) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case illustrate well the need to emphasize the employer's limited and carefully-defined role.

Here, there was not only a great deal of discussion about Tobin's difficulties, but significant action on the part of company officials. Liberty Mutual provided Tobin with multiple accommodations. The district court noted that \"[t]he record is filled with evidence of accommodations Liberty Mutual made for Tobin, including the provision of a nurse, computer trainings, and numerous meetings to help Tobin create the skills and plans to increase his sales effectiveness.\" <i>Tobin,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1922133</span></span> at *11. It is hard to imagine that all these measures were simply \"inflicted upon\" Tobin without any input on his part. We believe that Liberty Mutual followed the ADA regulations and that the steps taken by the company were sufficient to satisfy its obligation to engage in an \"interactive process.\" We therefore affirm the district court's holding on Tobin's \"interactive process\" claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the order of the district court regarding Tobin's \"failure to accommodate\" claim and remand that issue for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Aug.30, 2004). We note, however, that the standards under the ADA and Chapter 151B occasionally differ in ways that are relevant to this case. <i>See, e.g., Dahill v.

Here, we do not emphasize these differences, as the parties before the district court already stipulated that \"state and federal disability law are in accord\" for the purposes of this case. For this reason, throughout the remainder of this opinion, we frame our discussion primarily in terms of the ADA and federal case law, as the district court did.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> An alternative framework involves \"mixed-motive\" analysis, as established by the Supreme Court in<i>Price Waterhouse v.

Mixed-motive analysis is appropriate where evidence exists that an employer considered both a proscribed factor (for example, race or disability) and one or more legitimate factors (for example, competence) in making an adverse employment decision. <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> 490 U.S. at 241-242, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We believe that in this instance \"mixed-motive\" analysis is inapplicable. This is because Tobin raises the issue of the use of \"mixed-motive\" analysis for the first time on appeal. Contrary to Tobin's claim that he made \"implicit reference\" to a mixed-motive argument in the district court, Tobin never argued below that his claims should be analyzed under a mixed-motive framework.

Interactive process, after all, is the first step in a proper response to a disabled employee's request for reasonable accommodation. It is a means of ensuring that employers take steps to understand and address their employees' disabilities. Nevertheless, we treat Tobin's \"interactive process\" claim here separately because the parties briefed the issue separately and because we believe that it is possible for an employer to satisfy its duty to engage in \"interactive process\" yet still fail to provide \"reasonable accommodation\" to a disabled employee</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> State law imposes a similar requirement to engage in an \"interactive process.\"<i>See Russell v.

Liberty presented evidence that such assignments were merit based, while Tobin presented evidence that Liberty used non-merit based factors to make these assignments. <i>See id.</i> This disputed fact relates to Liberty's claim that it was not required to alter its assigning criteria as a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). But, as I read the district court opinion, this is not the ground on which summary judgment was granted. <i>Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> No. Civ.

As the district court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin has introduced no evidence as to how the assignment of mass marketing accounts would have addressed the particular deficiencies created by his particular disability. Indeed... more mass marketing accounts would likely have led to increased sales for <i>any</i> sales representative whether disabled or not. To be sure, Tobin's disability is grounds for accommodation under the ADA, it does not however, entitle him to any and every change in work conditions that would improve his performance. Rather, the accommodation must be <i>for</i> the disability, and Tobin has nowhere shown that assignment of mass marketing accounts were reasonable accommodations for his particular disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Tobin,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1922133</span></span>, at *10. I am not persuaded that the lead opinion's reliance on disputed facts related to Liberty's criteria for selecting agents for mass marketing accounts is sufficiently responsive to this reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, I agree that the district court's ruling was erroneous. The legal principle grounding the holding seems sound. <i>See Wood v.

The ADA's purpose is to provide a disabled employee with a reasonable accommodation that will help the employee overcome the limitation caused by his or her particular disability; it is not a statute intended to provide benefits to an employee simply because the employee happens to be disabled. <i>See Felix v. N.Y. City Transit Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781386\"><a href=\"/opinion/781386/denise-felix-naomi-felix-and-irene-cooper-as-administrators-of-the-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span>, 107 (2d Cir.2003) (\"The ADA mandates reasonable accommodation of people with disabilities in order to put them on an even playing field with the non-disabled; it does not authorize a preference for disabled people generally.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tobin has, however, generated sufficient record evidence to permit the conclusion that assigning him to a mass marketing account would have assisted him in overcoming the particular limitation caused by his bipolar disability. Tobin's supervisor testified that Tobin's biggest problem \"was identifying potential new customers and going to see them\" but that \"he [did] a good job at closing the sale.\" There was also evidence that, because mass marketing accounts provide the assigned agent with a captive audience of potential clients, closing skills are more important than business generation skills for agents assigned to these accounts. On this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that assigning Tobin to a mass marketing account would have assisted him in overcoming his disability-related problem of being insufficiently organized to identify and pursue new clients. For this reason, Tobin's reasonable accommodation claim should proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
