Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Lynch, Chief Judge,\n               Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Seth R. Aframe, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nJohn P. Kacavas, United States Attorney, Michael J. Gunnison,\nActing United States Attorney, and Aixa Maldonado-Quiñones,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n     Chauncy B. Wood, Wood & Nathanson LLP, for appellant.\n\n\n                          June 2, 2010\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.          The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984\n\n(\"Reform Act\") authorizes the district courts to modify a term of\n\nimprisonment    for    a   defendant    who    was    sentenced   \"based     on    a\n\nsentencing    range    that   has     subsequently     been   lowered   by    the\n\nSentencing Commission.\"        18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).            In this case,\n\ndefendant Eddy Roa-Medina was originally sentenced to a statutory\n\nminimum term of imprisonment of 120 months for distributing cocaine\n\nbase (\"crack\").       He was then given a reduced sentence pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b), which authorizes a\n\ndeparture \"below the minimum sentence established by statute\" if\n\nthe defendant provides \"substantial assistance in investigating or\n\nprosecuting    another     person.\"      The   U.S.    Sentencing    Commission\n\nsubsequently amended the Sentencing Guideline applicable to crack\n\noffenders in an attempt to mitigate the disparity between crack\n\ncocaine sentences and powder cocaine sentences.\n\n          The question before us is whether Roa-Medina is eligible\n\nfor a sentence modification under the Reform Act. We conclude that\n\nhe is not.\n\n                                       I.\n\n          Roa-Medina pleaded guilty in 2006 to four counts of\n\ndistributing controlled substances. Among the counts of conviction\n\nwere two counts of distributing fifty grams or more of crack, an\n\noffense punishable by a statutory minimum term of 120 months\n\nimprisonment.    See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(iii).                   At\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fthe sentencing hearing, the district court determined that Roa-\n\nMedina was responsible for 213.46 grams of crack, a quantity that\n\nyielded a base offense level of 34 under the version of the\n\nSentencing Guidelines Manual in effect at the time.1                 See U.S.\n\nSentencing Guidelines Manual § 2D1.1(c)(3) (Mar. 2006).          The court\n\nthen reduced the base offense level to 31 to reflect Roa-Medina's\n\nacceptance of responsibility; determined that Roa-Medina had a\n\ncriminal history category of I; and calculated an unrestricted\n\nguidelines range (i.e., one not taking into account the statutory\n\nlimitations) of 108 to 135 months imprisonment based on those\n\nvalues.    After accounting for the statutory minimum sentence, the\n\ndistrict   court   determined   that    Roa-Medina   was     subject    to   a\n\nrestricted guidelines range of 120 to 135 months.             It sentenced\n\nRoa-Medina    to   the   statutory     minimum   term   of     120     months\n\nimprisonment.\n\n           Roa-Medina subsequently agreed to assist the government\n\nby testifying in a related criminal case. The government moved for\n\na reduction of his sentence pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure 35(b).     The government recommended that the district\n\ncourt calculate the extent of the reduction by lowering Roa-\n\nMedina's offense level \"from 31 to 26, which would result in a\n\n\n     1\n          The district court also held Roa-Medina responsible for\n18.43 grams of heroin, which required it to convert both drugs to\ntheir marijuana equivalents and then combine the two quantities.\nBecause the quantity of heroin does not affect our analysis, we\nwill refer solely to the quantity of cocaine base.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fsentence range of 63 to 78 months,\" and reducing his sentence \"from\n\n120 months to 72 months, a 40% reduction.\"                The district court\n\ngranted    the    motion   and    adopted     the    government's    proposed\n\nmethodology.      It declared that Roa-Medina's \"offense level is\n\nreduced to 26\" and determined that the \"result[ing]\" guidelines\n\nrange was 63 to 78 months.            The district court then imposed an\n\namended sentence of 72 months imprisonment, which was 40% less than\n\nthe original sentence.\n\n            Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Sentencing Commission issued\n\na   retroactive    amendment     to    the   Guidelines    Manual   aimed    at\n\nmitigating the disparity between crack cocaine sentences and powder\n\ncocaine sentences.     See USSG app. C, amend. 706, 713.            Generally\n\nspeaking, the amendment \"adjust[ed] downward by two levels the base\n\noffense level ascribed to various quantities of crack cocaine\" in\n\nthe Guidelines Manual drug quantity table.                 United States v.\n\nCaraballo, 552 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 2008).           If it had been in effect\n\nat the time of Roa-Medina's original sentencing and at the time of\n\nhis Rule 35(b) hearing, the district court would have begun its\n\ncalculations with a base offense level of 32 rather than 34.                Roa-\n\nMedina attempted to take advantage of the change by filing a motion\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), which allows the district courts to\n\nmodify    previously   imposed    sentences    in   certain   situations     to\n\naccount for retroactive guidelines amendments.            The district court\n\ndenied the motion in a brief order, concluding that Roa-Medina did\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fnot qualify for a sentence reduction because he \"was subject to a\n\n10 year mandatory minimum sentence.\"             Roa-Medina now appeals from\n\nthat decision.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            As a general rule, the district courts may not modify a\n\nterm of imprisonment once it has been imposed.                     See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3582(c). The general rule has exceptions, however. Of relevance\n\nhere, the Reform Act provides:\n\n            [I]n the case of a defendant who has been\n            sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a\n            sentencing range that has subsequently been\n            lowered by the Sentencing Commission . . .,\n            the   court    may   reduce   the    term   of\n            imprisonment . . . if such a reduction is\n            consistent with applicable policy statements\n            issued by the Sentencing Commission.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).\n\n            A   defendant    may   seek      a    sentence       reduction   under\n\n§ 3582(c)(2) only if he meets a threshold eligibility requirement:\n\nhe   must   have   been   \"[1]   sentenced       to   a   term   of   imprisonment\n\n[2] based on a sentencing range [3] that has subsequently been\n\nlowered by the Sentencing Commission.\" The proposed reduction must\n\nalso be \"consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the\n\nSentencing Commission\" -- most relevantly, section 1B1.10 of the\n\nGuidelines Manual.2       The district court denied Roa-Medina's motion\n\n\n      2\n          Pursuant to the authority granted in 28 U.S.C. § 994(u),\nthe Sentencing Commission promulgated section 1B1.10 to \"provide[]\nguidance and limitations for a court when considering a motion\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).\"    USSG § 1B1.10 cmt. background.\n\n                                     -5-\n\ffor   a   sentence   reduction   on    the    ground   that   the   threshold\n\nrequirement was not satisfied.              Roa-Medina's appeal from that\n\ndecision raises a pure question of law, and our standard of review\n\nis de novo.    United States v. Fanfan, 558 F.3d 105, 107 (1st Cir.\n\n2009); Caraballo, 552 F.3d at 9.\n\n            Roa-Medina's argument is straightforward. He claims that\n\nhis current 72-month term of imprisonment is \"based on a sentencing\n\nrange\" that was lowered by the Sentencing Commission's amendment to\n\nthe crack guideline.      As he correctly points out, the district\n\ncourt arrived at the 72-month sentence by starting with a base\n\noffense level of 34; factoring in a three-level reduction for\n\nacceptance    of   responsibility     and    a   five-level   reduction   for\n\nsubstantial assistance; cross-referencing the adjusted offense\n\nlevel of 26 with Roa-Medina's criminal history category of I; and\n\nthen selecting a sentence within the resulting guidelines range of\n\n63 to 78 months.      If the amendment had been in effect when the\n\ngovernment filed its Rule 35(b) motion, Roa-Medina argues, the\n\n\nAlthough the key eligibility language in the policy statement\nvaries slightly from the statutory language, compare 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3582(c)(2) (referring to cases in which the defendant has been\n\"sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range\nthat has subsequently been lowered\"), with USSG § 1B1.10(a)(1)\n(referring to cases in which the defendant \"is serving a term of\nimprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant\nhas subsequently been lowered\"), we agree with the Tenth Circuit\nthat, for all purposes relevant to this appeal, the two provisions\nare \"identical\" and \"convey[] the same meaning.\" United States v.\nDarton, 595 F.3d 1191, 1194 (10th Cir. 2010) (quoting United States\nv. Dryden, 563 F.3d 1168, 1170-71 (10th Cir. 2009)).\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fdistrict court would have started with an amended base offense\n\nlevel of 32 instead of 34.         After accounting for Roa-Medina's\n\nacceptance of responsibility and substantial assistance, the final\n\noffense level would have been 24 instead of 26, and the resulting\n\nguidelines range would have been significantly lower: 51 to 63\n\nmonths.\n\n            The government counters that Roa-Medina's sentence is\n\n\"based    on\"   a   statutory   minimum   rather   than   the   Sentencing\n\nGuidelines. On the government's theory, Roa-Medina is not eligible\n\nfor a sentence reduction because the statutory minimum has not been\n\n\"lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\"        18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2);\n\nsee also United States v. Ganun, 547 F.3d 46, 47 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(per curiam) (\"[T]he Sentencing Commission is without power to\n\ndetermine statutory minimums.\").\n\nA.   \"Based on a Sentencing Range\"\n\n            Our first task is to determine what \"sentencing range\"\n\nRoa-Medina's term of imprisonment was \"based on.\"               Roa-Medina\n\nargues that the sentence was based on the guidelines range that the\n\ndistrict court announced at the Rule 35(b) hearing: 63 to 78\n\nmonths.   That view finds some support in the case law.         See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Blackwell, No. 05-66, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51497,\n\nat *40-*41 (S.D. Ohio Feb. 13, 2009).\n\n            Ultimately, however, Roa-Medina's argument misunderstands\n\nthe nature and effect of a substantial assistance departure.          The\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fthree substantial assistance provisions -- USSG § 5K1.1, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(e), and Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b)3 -- do not authorize a\n\ndistrict court to alter the applicable guidelines range.                  Rather,\n\nthey permit the court to deviate from that range based on a\n\nspecific    factor      (the   defendant's        cooperation)    that   was   not\n\naccounted for in the basic guidelines calculation.                       Cf. USSG\n\n§ 1B1.1 cmt. n.1(E) (\"'Departure' means . . . imposition of a\n\nsentence outside the applicable guideline range or of a sentence\n\nthat is otherwise different from the guideline sentence . . . .\")\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n            All three provisions operate in conjunction with the\n\nSentencing Guidelines.           At the initial sentencing, the district\n\ncourt must calculate the applicable guidelines range before it may\n\ndepart    from   that    range    based    on    the   defendant's     substantial\n\nassistance.       See USSG § 1B1.1.             The guidelines automatically\n\naccount for statutory limitations at that stage, see United States\n\nv.   Ahlers,     305   F.3d    54,   60-61      (1st   Cir.   2002),   yielding   a\n\n\"restricted\" guidelines range that runs from the greater of the\n\nstatutory minimum or the guidelines minimum to the lesser of the\n\nstatutory maximum or the guidelines maximum.                     See, e.g., USSG\n\n\n\n      3\n          We limit our discussion of Rule 35(b) to the version that\nwas in effect when the district court reduced Roa-Medina's\nsentence. The rule has since been amended, and the effects of that\namendment are slowly being explored. See, e.g., United States v.\nPoland, 562 F.3d 35 (1st Cir. 2009); United States v. Shelby, 584\nF.3d 743 (7th Cir. 2009).\n\n                                          -8-\n\f§ 5G1.1 cmt. (\"If the applicable guideline range is 51-63 months\n\nand the maximum sentence authorized by statute for the offense of\n\nconviction is 60 months, the guideline range is restricted to 51-60\n\nmonths . . . .\").4       If the court determines that a departure from\n\nthe restricted guidelines range is warranted, it takes the lower\n\nend of the range as its \"starting point\" and departs from that\n\npoint as necessary to reflect the defendant's assistance.               United\n\nStates v. Li, 206 F.3d 78, 89 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v.\n\nAuld, 321 F.3d 861, 867 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\n           A   post-sentencing     reduction   under     Rule   35(b)    works\n\nsimilarly.        Like   the   provisions   applicable    at    the   initial\n\nsentencing, Rule 35(b) uses the original guidelines range as a\n\nframe of reference.         See Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b)(1)(B) (2007)\n\n(permitting reduction only in \"accord[ance] with the Sentencing\n\nCommission's guidelines and policy statements\").             Where, as here,\n\nthe   defendant    was   originally   sentenced   at   the   bottom     of   the\n\nrestricted guidelines range (the statutory minimum), the district\n\ncourt starts from that point and departs as necessary to reflect\n\n\n\n\n      4\n          If the unrestricted guidelines range falls entirely\noutside the statutory limits, the restricted guidelines \"range\" is\na single point. See USSG § 5G1.1(a)-(b); United States v. Li, 206\nF.3d 78, 89 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"Because [the unrestricted guidelines\nrange of 15 to 21 months] is obviously lower than the applicable\n36-month mandatory minimum, the court properly adjusted the\nguideline range to a 'range' of 36 to 36 months before applying any\nupward or downward departures.\").\n\n                                      -9-\n\fthe defendant's assistance.        See United States v. Donnell, No. 02-\n\n37, 2008 WL 564647, at *1 n.1 (D. Me. Feb. 29, 2008).\n\n             As   this   brief   overview   suggests,   sentences   imposed\n\npursuant to the substantial assistance provisions remain \"based on\"\n\nthe original restricted guidelines range, which continues to serve\n\nas the anchor point for the ultimate sentence.               A number of\n\ncircuits have reached that conclusion in the context of § 5K1.1 and\n\n§ 3553(e), holding that the post-departure sentence is \"based on\"\n\nthe pre-departure restricted guidelines range.          See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Carter, 595 F.3d 575, 580-81 (5th Cir. 2010) (per\n\ncuriam); United States v. Byers, 561 F.3d 825, 830-32 (8th Cir.\n\n2009); United States v. Williams, 549 F.3d 1337, 1340-41 (11th Cir.\n\n2008) (per curiam).        We now join the Seventh Circuit in holding\n\nthat the same reasoning applies to sentences reduced under Rule\n\n35(b) -- they remain \"based on\" the restricted guidelines range\n\nthat applied at the initial sentencing.            See United States v.\n\nPoole, 550 F.3d 676, 678, 680 (7th Cir. 2008); see also Byers, 561\n\nF.3d at 830-32 (holding that the relevant guidelines range for\n\ndefendants who benefitted from all three substantial assistance\n\nprovisions was the original restricted guidelines range).\n\n             It is true that district courts sometimes implement Rule\n\n35(b) reductions by \"lowering\" the defendant's offense level and\n\nrecalculating the guidelines range, as the district court did in\n\nthis case.    But that method employs a fiction.        As a legal matter,\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fa district court may consider only the defendant's assistance in\n\ndetermining the extent of a Rule 35(b) reduction.   See Poland, 562\n\nF.3d at 38, 40-41.   The \"lowered\" offense level is nothing more\n\nthan a useful way of quantifying the defendant's assistance.\n\nNeither Rule 35(b) nor the Sentencing Guidelines specifies a method\n\nfor calculating the extent of a substantial assistance departure,\n\nand the district courts in fact use a variety of methods, including\n\npercentage-based calculations and calculations based on an absolute\n\nnumber of months.    See United States v. Fennell, 592 F.3d 506,\n\n510-11 (4th Cir. 2010); see also Bruce M. Selya & John C. Massaro,\n\nThe Illustrative Role of Substantial Assistance Departures in\n\nCombatting Ultra-Uniformity, 35 B.C. L. Rev. 799, 829-30 (1994)\n\n(noting that sentencing courts \"may,\" but \"need not,\" refer to \"the\n\nvertical axis of the sentencing grid as the base for making\n\n[substantial assistance] departures\").\n\n          Other courts have held, and we agree, that a district\n\ncourt's \"reference to offense levels in making its discretionary\n\ndecision of how far to depart [does] not amount to the application\n\nof a 'sentencing range' authorized and made applicable by the\n\nSentencing Guidelines and therefore [is] of no legal significance\n\nto the analysis under § 3582(c)(2).\" United States v. Lindsey, 556\n\nF.3d 238, 245-46 (4th Cir. 2009); United States v. Smiley, 356 F.\n\nApp'x 302, 305-06 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam).    Cf. Caraballo,\n\n552 F.3d at 9 (rejecting the argument that the district court's\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f\"oblique reference to the crack cocaine guideline was enough to\n\ntrigger section 3582(c)(2)\"). The ultimate sentence remains \"based\n\non\" the original restricted guidelines range.\n\n          Following that analysis, we conclude that Roa-Medina was\n\nsentenced to a term of imprisonment that was \"based on a sentencing\n\nrange\" of 120 months (the statutory minimum) to 135 months (the\n\nguidelines maximum).     As noted by the government at the Rule 35(b)\n\nhearing, the reduced sentence represented a 40% deviation from the\n\nbottom of that range.\n\nB.    \"That has      Subsequently   been    Lowered   by   the   Sentencing\nCommission\"\n\n               The   remaining   question    is   whether    Roa-Medina's\n\nsentencing range was \"subsequently . . . lowered by the Sentencing\n\nCommission.\"    18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).      In making that inquiry, we\n\nmust calculate \"the amended guideline range that would have been\n\napplicable to the defendant if the [retroactive amendment] had been\n\nin effect at the time the defendant was sentenced[,] . . .\n\nleav[ing] all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\"\n\nUSSG § 1B1.10(b)(1).\n\n          In this case, the crack amendment had no effect on the\n\nbottom of the restricted guidelines range (the statutory minimum),\n\nwhich was the legal \"starting point\" for Roa-Medina's substantial\n\nassistance reduction.     It also had no effect on the value of Roa-\n\nMedina's cooperation, which was the only factor that could be\n\nconsidered in determining the \"distance\" of the reduction.              In\n\n                                    -12-\n\fother words, both of the factors critical to the sentencing outcome\n\nremained the same. Roa-Medina's sentencing range has therefore not\n\nbeen \"lowered\" within the meaning of § 3582(c)(2).    As the policy\n\nstatement puts it, the crack amendment did not \"have the effect of\n\nlowering the defendant's applicable guideline range because of the\n\noperation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a\n\nstatutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\"   USSG § 1B1.10\n\ncmt. n.1(A).   The district court properly denied Roa-Medina's\n\n§ 3582(c)(2) motion.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f",

Wood, Wood &amp; Nathanson LLP, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, LIPEZ and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (\"Reform Act\") authorizes the district courts to modify a term of imprisonment for a defendant who was sentenced \"based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). In this case, defendant Eddy Roa-Medina was originally sentenced to a statutory minimum term of imprisonment of 120 months for distributing cocaine base (\"crack\"). He was then given a reduced sentence pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b), which authorizes a departure \"below the minimum sentence established by statute\" if the defendant provides \"substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.\" The U.S. Sentencing Commission subsequently amended the Sentencing Guideline applicable to crack offenders in an attempt to mitigate the disparity between crack cocaine sentences and powder cocaine sentences.</p>\n<p>The question before us is whether Roa-Medina is eligible for a sentence modification under the Reform Act. We conclude that he is not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Roa-Medina pleaded guilty in 2006 to four counts of distributing controlled substances. Among the counts of conviction were two counts of distributing fifty grams or more of crack, an offense punishable by a statutory minimum term of 120 months imprisonment. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). At the sentencing hearing, the district court determined that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*257</span> Roa-Medina was responsible for 213.46 grams of crack, a quantity that yielded a base offense level of 34 under the version of the Sentencing Guidelines Manual in effect at the time.<sup>[1]</sup><i>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual</i> § 2D1.1(c)(3) (Mar. 2006). The court then reduced the base offense level to 31 to reflect Roa-Medina's acceptance of responsibility; determined that Roa-Medina had a criminal history category of I; and calculated an unrestricted guidelines range (i.e., one not taking into account the statutory limitations) of 108 to 135 months imprisonment based on those values. After accounting for the statutory minimum sentence, the district court determined that Roa-Medina was subject to a restricted guidelines range of 120 to 135 months. It sentenced Roa-Medina to the statutory minimum term of 120 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Roa-Medina subsequently agreed to assist the government by testifying in a related criminal case. The government moved for a reduction of his sentence pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b). The government recommended that the district court calculate the extent of the reduction by lowering Roa-Medina's offense level \"from 31 to 26, which would result in a sentence range of 63 to 78 months,\" and reducing his sentence \"from 120 months to 72 months, a 40% reduction.\" The district court granted the motion and adopted the government's proposed methodology. It declared that Roa-Medina's \"offense level is reduced to 26\" and determined that the \"result[ing]\" guidelines range was 63 to 78 months. The district court then imposed an amended sentence of 72 months imprisonment, which was 40% less than the original sentence.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Sentencing Commission issued a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines Manual aimed at mitigating the disparity between crack cocaine sentences and powder cocaine sentences. <i>See</i> USSG app. C, amend. 706, 713. Generally speaking, the amendment \"adjust[ed] downward by two levels the base offense level ascribed to various quantities of crack cocaine\" in the Guidelines Manual drug quantity table. <i>United States v. Caraballo,</i> 552 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir.2008). If it had been in effect at the time of Roa-Medina's original sentencing and at the time of his Rule 35(b) hearing, the district court would have begun its calculations with a base offense level of 32 rather than 34. Roa-Medina attempted to take advantage of the change by filing a motion under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), which allows the district courts to modify previously imposed sentences in certain situations to account for retroactive guidelines amendments. The district court denied the motion in a brief order, concluding that Roa-Medina did not qualify for a sentence reduction because he \"was subject to a 10 year mandatory minimum sentence.\" Roa-Medina now appeals from that decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>As a general rule, the district courts may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c). The general rule has exceptions, however. Of relevance here, the Reform Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote>[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*258</span> based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission . . ., the court may reduce the term of imprisonment. . . if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p>A defendant may seek a sentence reduction under § 3582(c)(2) only if he meets a threshold eligibility requirement: he must have been \"[1] sentenced to a term of imprisonment [2] based on a sentencing range [3] that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\" The proposed reduction must also be \"consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\" most relevantly, section 1B1.10 of the Guidelines Manual.<sup>[2]</sup> The district court denied Roa-Medina's motion for a sentence reduction on the ground that the threshold requirement was not satisfied. Roa-Medina's appeal from that decision raises a pure question of law, and our standard of review is de novo. <i>United States v. Fanfan,</i> 558 F.3d 105, 107 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Caraballo,</i> 552 F.3d at 9.</p>\n<p>Roa-Medina's argument is straightforward. He claims that his current 72-month term of imprisonment is \"based on a sentencing range\" that was lowered by the Sentencing Commission's amendment to the crack guideline. As he correctly points out, the district court arrived at the 72-month sentence by starting with a base offense level of 34; factoring in a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and a five-level reduction for substantial assistance; cross-referencing the adjusted offense level of 26 with Roa-Medina's criminal history category of I; and then selecting a sentence within the resulting guidelines range of 63 to 78 months. If the amendment had been in effect when the government filed its Rule 35(b) motion, Roa-Medina argues, the district court would have started with an amended base offense level of 32 instead of 34. After accounting for Roa-Medina's acceptance of responsibility and substantial assistance, the final offense level would have been 24 instead of 26, and the resulting guidelines range would have been significantly lower: 51 to 63 months.</p>\n<p>The government counters that Roa-Medina's sentence is \"based on\" a statutory minimum rather than the Sentencing Guidelines. On the government's theory, Roa-Medina is not eligible for a sentence reduction because the statutory minimum has not been \"lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Ganun,</i> 547 F.3d 46, 47 (1st Cir.2008) (per curiam) (\"[T]he Sentencing Commission is without power to determine statutory minimums.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. \"Based on a Sentencing Range\"</h2>\n<p>Our first task is to determine what \"sentencing range\" Roa-Medina's term of imprisonment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*259</span> was \"based on.\" Roa-Medina argues that the sentence was based on the guidelines range that the district court announced at the Rule 35(b) hearing: 63 to 78 months. That view finds some support in the case law. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Blackwell,</i> No. 05-66, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51497, at *40-*41 (S.D.Ohio Feb. 13, 2009).</p>\n<p>Ultimately, however, Roa-Medina's argument misunderstands the nature and effect of a substantial assistance departure. The three substantial assistance provisionsUSSG § 5K1.1, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), and Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)<sup>[3]</sup>do not authorize a district court to alter the applicable guidelines range. Rather, they permit the court to deviate from that range based on a specific factor (the defendant's cooperation) that was not accounted for in the basic guidelines calculation. <i>Cf.</i> USSG § 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(E) (\"`Departure' means . . . imposition of a sentence <i>outside</i> the applicable guideline range or of a sentence that is otherwise <i>different from</i> the guideline sentence . . . .\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>All three provisions operate in conjunction with the Sentencing Guidelines. At the initial sentencing, the district court must calculate the applicable guidelines range before it may depart from that range based on the defendant's substantial assistance. <i>See</i> USSG § 1B1.1. The guidelines automatically account for statutory limitations at that stage, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Ahlers,</i> 305 F.3d 54, 60-61 (1st Cir.2002), yielding a \"restricted\" guidelines range that runs from the greater of the statutory minimum or the guidelines minimum to the lesser of the statutory maximum or the guidelines maximum. <i>See, e.g.,</i> USSG § 5G1.1 cmt. (\"If the applicable guideline range is 51-63 months and the maximum sentence authorized by statute for the offense of conviction is 60 months, the guideline range is restricted to 51-60 months. . . .\").<sup>[4]</sup> If the court determines that a departure from the restricted guidelines range is warranted, it takes the lower end of the range as its \"starting point\" and departs from that point as necessary to reflect the defendant's assistance. <i>United States v. Li,</i> 206 F.3d 78, 89 (1st Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Auld,</i> 321 F.3d 861, 867 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>A post-sentencing reduction under Rule 35(b) works similarly. Like the provisions applicable at the initial sentencing, Rule 35(b) uses the original guidelines range as a frame of reference. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(1)(B) (2007) (permitting reduction only in \"accord[ance] with the Sentencing Commission's guidelines and policy statements\"). Where, as here, the defendant was originally sentenced at the bottom of the restricted guidelines range (the statutory minimum), the district court starts from that point and departs as necessary to reflect the defendant's assistance. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Donnell,</i> No. 02-37, 2008 WL 564647, at *1 n. 1 (D.Me. Feb. 29, 2008).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*260</span> As this brief overview suggests, sentences imposed pursuant to the substantial assistance provisions remain \"based on\" the original restricted guidelines range, which continues to serve as the anchor point for the ultimate sentence. A number of circuits have reached that conclusion in the context of § 5K1.1 and § 3553(e), holding that the post-departure sentence is \"based on\" the pre-departure restricted guidelines range. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Carter,</i> 595 F.3d 575, 580-81 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam); <i>United States v. Byers,</i> 561 F.3d 825, 830-32 (8th Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Williams,</i> 549 F.3d 1337, 1340-41 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). We now join the Seventh Circuit in holding that the same reasoning applies to sentences reduced under Rule 35(b)they remain \"based on\" the restricted guidelines range that applied at the initial sentencing. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Poole,</i> 550 F.3d 676, 678, 680 (7th Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>Byers,</i> 561 F.3d at 830-32 (holding that the relevant guidelines range for defendants who benefited from all three substantial assistance provisions was the original restricted guidelines range).</p>\n<p>It is true that district courts sometimes implement Rule 35(b) reductions by \"lowering\" the defendant's offense level and recalculating the guidelines range, as the district court did in this case. But that method employs a fiction. As a legal matter, a district court may consider only the defendant's assistance in determining the extent of a Rule 35(b) reduction. <i>See </i><i>Poland,</i> 562 F.3d at 38, 40-41. The \"lowered\" offense level is nothing more than a useful way of quantifying the defendant's assistance. Neither Rule 35(b) nor the Sentencing Guidelines specifies a method for calculating the extent of a substantial assistance departure, and the district courts in fact use a variety of methods, including percentage-based calculations and calculations based on an absolute number of months. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Fennell,</i> 592 F.3d 506, 510-11 (4th Cir.2010); <i>see also</i> Bruce M. Selya &amp; John C. Massaro, <i>The Illustrative Role of Substantial Assistance Departures in Combatting Ultra-Uniformity,</i> 35 B.C. L.Rev. 799, 829-30 (1994) (noting that sentencing courts \"may,\" but \"need not,\" refer to \"the vertical axis of the sentencing grid as the base for making [substantial assistance] departures\").</p>\n<p>Other courts have held, and we agree, that a district court's \"reference to offense levels in making its discretionary decision of how far to depart [does] not amount to the application of a `sentencing range' authorized and made applicable by the Sentencing Guidelines and therefore [is] of no legal significance to the analysis under § 3582(c)(2).\" <i>United States v. Lindsey,</i> 556 F.3d 238, 245-46 (4th Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Smiley,</i> 356 Fed.Appx. 302, 305-06 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). <i>Cf. </i><i>Caraballo,</i> 552 F.3d at 9 (rejecting the argument that the district court's \"oblique reference to the crack cocaine guideline was enough to trigger section 3582(c)(2)\"). The ultimate sentence remains \"based on\" the original restricted guidelines range.</p>\n<p>Following that analysis, we conclude that Roa-Medina was sentenced to a term of imprisonment that was \"based on a sentencing range\" of 120 months (the statutory minimum) to 135 months (the guidelines maximum). As noted by the government at the Rule 35(b) hearing, the reduced sentence represented a 40% deviation from the bottom of that range.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. \"That has Subsequently been Lowered by the Sentencing Commission\"</h2>\n<p>The remaining question is whether Roa-Medina's sentencing range was \"subsequently. . . lowered by the Sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*261</span> Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). In making that inquiry, we must calculate \"the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the [retroactive amendment] had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced[,]. . . leav[ing] all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\" USSG § 1B1.10(b)(1).</p>\n<p>In this case, the crack amendment had no effect on the bottom of the restricted guidelines range (the statutory minimum), which was the legal \"starting point\" for Roa-Medina's substantial assistance reduction. It also had no effect on the value of Roa-Medina's cooperation, which was the only factor that could be considered in determining the \"distance\" of the reduction. In other words, both of the factors critical to the sentencing outcome remained the same. Roa-Medina's sentencing range has therefore not been \"lowered\" within the meaning of § 3582(c)(2). As the policy statement puts it, the crack amendment did not \"have the effect of lowering the defendant's applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (<i>e.g.,</i> a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\" USSG § 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). The district court properly denied Roa-Medina's § 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p><i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The district court also held Roa-Medina responsible for 18.43 grams of heroin, which required it to convert both drugs to their marijuana equivalents and then combine the two quantities. Because the quantity of heroin does not affect our analysis, we will refer solely to the quantity of cocaine base.</p>\n<p>[2]  Pursuant to the authority granted in 28 U.S.C. § 994(u), the Sentencing Commission promulgated section 1B1.10 to \"provide[] guidance and limitations for a court when considering a motion under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).\" USSG § 1B1.10 cmt. background. Although the key eligibility language in the policy statement varies slightly from the statutory language, <i>compare</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) (referring to cases in which the defendant has been \"sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered\"), <i>with</i> USSG § 1B1.10(a)(1) (referring to cases in which the defendant \"is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered\"), we agree with the Tenth Circuit that, for all purposes relevant to this appeal, the two provisions are \"identical\" and \"convey[] the same meaning.\" <i>United States v. Darton,</i> 595 F.3d 1191, 1194 (10th Cir.2010) (quoting <i>United States v. Dryden,</i> 563 F.3d 1168, 1170-71 (10th Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p>[3]  We limit our discussion of Rule 35(b) to the version that was in effect when the district court reduced Roa-Medina's sentence. The rule has since been amended, and the effects of that amendment are slowly being explored. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Poland,</i> 562 F.3d 35 (1st Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Shelby,</i> 584 F.3d 743 (7th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>[4]  If the unrestricted guidelines range falls entirely outside the statutory limits, the restricted guidelines \"range\" is a single point. <i>See</i> USSG § 5G1.1(a)-(b); <i>United States v. Li,</i> 206 F.3d 78, 89 (1st Cir.2000) (\"Because [the unrestricted guidelines range of 15 to 21 months] is obviously lower than the applicable 36-month mandatory minimum, the court properly adjusted the guideline range to a `range' of 36 to 36 months before applying any upward or downward departures.\").</p>\n\n</div>",

Fanfan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203706\"><a href=\"/opinion/203706/united-states-v-fanfan/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 107 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Caraballo,</i> 552 F.3d at 9.</p>\n<p>Roa-Medina's argument is straightforward. He claims that his current 72-month term of imprisonment is \"based on a sentencing range\" that was lowered by the Sentencing Commission's amendment to the crack guideline. As he correctly points out, the district court arrived at the 72-month sentence by starting with a base offense level of 34; factoring in a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and a five-level reduction for substantial assistance; cross-referencing the adjusted offense level of 26 with Roa-Medina's criminal history category of I; and then selecting a sentence within the resulting guidelines range of 63 to 78 months. If the amendment had been in effect when the government filed its Rule 35(b) motion, Roa-Medina argues, the district court would have started with an amended base offense level of 32 instead of 34. After accounting for Roa-Medina's acceptance of responsibility and substantial assistance, the final offense level would have been 24 instead of 26, and the resulting guidelines range would have been significantly lower: 51 to 63 months.</p>\n<p>The government counters that Roa-Medina's sentence is \"based on\" a statutory minimum rather than the Sentencing Guidelines. On the government's theory, Roa-Medina is not eligible for a sentence reduction because the statutory minimum has not been \"lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Ganun,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203558\"><a href=\"/opinion/203558/united-states-v-ganun/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.2008) (per curiam) (\"[T]he Sentencing Commission is without power to determine statutory minimums.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. \"Based on a Sentencing Range\"</h2>\n<p>Our first task is to determine what \"sentencing range\" Roa-Medina's term of imprisonment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*259</span> was \"based on.\" Roa-Medina argues that the sentence was based on the guidelines range that the district court announced at the Rule 35(b) hearing: 63 to 78 months. That view finds some support in the case law. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Blackwell,</i> No. 05-66, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">51497</span></span>, at *40-*41 (S.D.Ohio Feb. 13, 2009).</p>\n<p>Ultimately, however, Roa-Medina's argument misunderstands the nature and effect of a substantial assistance departure. The three substantial assistance provisionsUSSG § 5K1.1, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), and Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)<sup>[3]</sup>do not authorize a district court to alter the applicable guidelines range. Rather, they permit the court to deviate from that range based on a specific factor (the defendant's cooperation) that was not accounted for in the basic guidelines calculation. <i>Cf.</i> USSG § 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(E) (\"`Departure' means . . . imposition of a sentence <i>outside</i> the applicable guideline range or of a sentence that is otherwise <i>different from</i> the guideline sentence . . . .\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>All three provisions operate in conjunction with the Sentencing Guidelines. At the initial sentencing, the district court must calculate the applicable guidelines range before it may depart from that range based on the defendant's substantial assistance. <i>See</i> USSG § 1B1.1. The guidelines automatically account for statutory limitations at that stage, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Ahlers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200139\"><a href=\"/opinion/200139/united-states-v-ahlers/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 60-61 (1st Cir.2002), yielding a \"restricted\" guidelines range that runs from the greater of the statutory minimum or the guidelines minimum to the lesser of the statutory maximum or the guidelines maximum. <i>See, e.g.,</i> USSG § 5G1.1 cmt. (\"If the applicable guideline range is 51-63 months and the maximum sentence authorized by statute for the offense of conviction is 60 months, the guideline range is restricted to 51-60 months. . . .\").<sup>[4]</sup> If the court determines that a departure from the restricted guidelines range is warranted, it takes the lower end of the range as its \"starting point\" and departs from that point as necessary to reflect the defendant's assistance. <i>United States v. Li,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767956\"><a href=\"/opinion/767956/united-states-v-nai-fook-li-united-states-v-yiu-ming-kwan-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 89 (1st Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Auld,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781112\"><a href=\"/opinion/781112/united-states-v-vince-a-auld/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">861</span></a></span>, 867 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>A post-sentencing reduction under Rule 35(b) works similarly. Like the provisions applicable at the initial sentencing, Rule 35(b) uses the original guidelines range as a frame of reference. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(1)(B) (2007) (permitting reduction only in \"accord[ance] with the Sentencing Commission's guidelines and policy statements\"). Where, as here, the defendant was originally sentenced at the bottom of the restricted guidelines range (the statutory minimum), the district court starts from that point and departs as necessary to reflect the defendant's assistance. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Donnell,</i> No. 02-37, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">564647</span></span>, at *1 n. 1 (D.Me. Feb. 29, 2008).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*260</span> As this brief overview suggests, sentences imposed pursuant to the substantial assistance provisions remain \"based on\" the original restricted guidelines range, which continues to serve as the anchor point for the ultimate sentence. A number of circuits have reached that conclusion in the context of § 5K1.1 and § 3553(e), holding that the post-departure sentence is \"based on\" the pre-departure restricted guidelines range. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Carter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70839\"><a href=\"/opinion/70839/united-states-v-carter/\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 580-81 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam); <i>United States v. Byers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1373447\"><a href=\"/opinion/1373447/united-states-v-byers/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span>, 830-32 (8th Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78180\"><a href=\"/opinion/78180/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1337</span></a></span>, 1340-41 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). We now join the Seventh Circuit in holding that the same reasoning applies to sentences reduced under Rule 35(b)they remain \"based on\" the restricted guidelines range that applied at the initial sentencing. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Poole,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1204596\"><a href=\"/opinion/1204596/united-states-v-poole/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span>, 678, 680 (7th Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>Byers,</i> 561 F.3d at 830-32 (holding that the relevant guidelines range for defendants who benefited from all three substantial assistance provisions was the original restricted guidelines range).</p>\n<p>It is true that district courts sometimes implement Rule 35(b) reductions by \"lowering\" the defendant's offense level and recalculating the guidelines range, as the district court did in this case. But that method employs a fiction. As a legal matter, a district court may consider only the defendant's assistance in determining the extent of a Rule 35(b) reduction. <i>See </i><i>Poland,</i> 562 F.3d at 38, 40-41. The \"lowered\" offense level is nothing more than a useful way of quantifying the defendant's assistance. Neither Rule 35(b) nor the Sentencing Guidelines specifies a method for calculating the extent of a substantial assistance departure, and the district courts in fact use a variety of methods, including percentage-based calculations and calculations based on an absolute number of months. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Fennell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1031298\"><a href=\"/opinion/1031298/united-states-v-fennell/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 510-11 (4th Cir.2010); <i>see also</i> Bruce M. Selya &amp; John C. Massaro, <i>The Illustrative Role of Substantial Assistance Departures in Combatting Ultra-Uniformity,</i> 35 B.C. L.Rev. 799, 829-30 (1994) (noting that sentencing courts \"may,\" but \"need not,\" refer to \"the vertical axis of the sentencing grid as the base for making [substantial assistance] departures\").</p>\n<p>Other courts have held, and we agree, that a district court's \"reference to offense levels in making its discretionary decision of how far to depart [does] not amount to the application of a `sentencing range' authorized and made applicable by the Sentencing Guidelines and therefore [is] of no legal significance to the analysis under § 3582(c)(2).\" <i>United States v. Lindsey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1027862\"><a href=\"/opinion/1027862/united-states-v-lindsey/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 245-46 (4th Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Smiley,</i> 356 Fed.Appx. 302, 305-06 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). <i>Cf. </i><i>Caraballo,</i> 552 F.3d at 9 (rejecting the argument that the district court's \"oblique reference to the crack cocaine guideline was enough to trigger section 3582(c)(2)\"). The ultimate sentence remains \"based on\" the original restricted guidelines range.</p>\n<p>Following that analysis, we conclude that Roa-Medina was sentenced to a term of imprisonment that was \"based on a sentencing range\" of 120 months (the statutory minimum) to 135 months (the guidelines maximum). As noted by the government at the Rule 35(b) hearing, the reduced sentence represented a 40% deviation from the bottom of that range.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. \"That has Subsequently been Lowered by the Sentencing Commission\"</h2>\n<p>The remaining question is whether Roa-Medina's sentencing range was \"subsequently. . . lowered by the Sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*261</span> Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). In making that inquiry, we must calculate \"the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the [retroactive amendment] had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced[,]. . . leav[ing] all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\" USSG § 1B1.10(b)(1).</p>\n<p>In this case, the crack amendment had no effect on the bottom of the restricted guidelines range (the statutory minimum), which was the legal \"starting point\" for Roa-Medina's substantial assistance reduction. It also had no effect on the value of Roa-Medina's cooperation, which was the only factor that could be considered in determining the \"distance\" of the reduction. In other words, both of the factors critical to the sentencing outcome remained the same. Roa-Medina's sentencing range has therefore not been \"lowered\" within the meaning of § 3582(c)(2). As the policy statement puts it, the crack amendment did not \"have the effect of lowering the defendant's applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (<i>e.g.,</i> a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\" USSG § 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). The district court properly denied Roa-Medina's § 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p><i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The district court also held Roa-Medina responsible for 18.43 grams of heroin, which required it to convert both drugs to their marijuana equivalents and then combine the two quantities. Because the quantity of heroin does not affect our analysis, we will refer solely to the quantity of cocaine base.</p>\n<p>[2]  Pursuant to the authority granted in 28 U.S.C. § 994(u), the Sentencing Commission promulgated section 1B1.10 to \"provide[] guidance and limitations for a court when considering a motion under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).\" USSG § 1B1.10 cmt. background. Although the key eligibility language in the policy statement varies slightly from the statutory language, <i>compare</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) (referring to cases in which the defendant has been \"sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered\"), <i>with</i> USSG § 1B1.10(a)(1) (referring to cases in which the defendant \"is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered\"), we agree with the Tenth Circuit that, for all purposes relevant to this appeal, the two provisions are \"identical\" and \"convey[] the same meaning.\" <i>United States v. Darton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"173248\"><a href=\"/opinion/173248/united-states-v-darton/\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1191</span></a></span>, 1194 (10th Cir.2010) (quoting <i>United States v.

The rule has since been amended, and the effects of that amendment are slowly being explored. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Poland,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></span> (1st Cir.2009); <i>United States v.
