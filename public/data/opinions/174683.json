Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                     Boudin, Howard and Thompson,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Syrie D. Fried, Federal Public Defender, on brief for\nappellant.\n     Robert E. Richardson, Assistant U.S. Attorney and Carmen M.\nOrtiz, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          September 2, 2010\n\f           Per Curiam. We have reviewed the record and the parties'\n\nsubmissions.      We   allow    the    government's    motion     for   summary\n\ndisposition, and we affirm.\n\n           Under the mandate rule, \"a legal decision made at one\n\nstage of a civil or criminal case, unchallenged in a subsequent\n\nappeal despite the existence of ample opportunity to do so, becomes\n\nthe law of the case for future stages of the same litigation, and\n\nthe aggrieved party is deemed to have forfeited any right to\n\nchallenge that particular decision at a subsequent date.\"               United\n\nStates v. Bell, 988 F.2d 247, 250 (1st Cir. 1993).                 Still, the\n\ndistrict court may review its earlier decision if it concludes that\n\nthe decision amounted to a blatant error that, if left uncorrected,\n\nwill result in a serious injustice.           Id. at 251.   Where the mandate\n\nrule is in effect, a district court's decision whether to review an\n\nearlier decision in the proceedings is reviewed by this court for\n\nan abuse of discretion.        See Harlow v. Children's Hosp., 432 F.3d\n\n50, 55-56 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           We agree with the district court that there was no\n\nblatant error in its previous decision to sentence the appellant,\n\nAndre   Ellis   (\"Ellis\"),     under    the    Armed   Career    Criminal   Act\n\n(\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).           The ACCA applies where a person\n\nconvicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) has three previous convictions\n\nfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense.                 A \"conviction\"\n\n\"includes a finding that a person has committed an act of juvenile\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fdelinquency involving a violent felony.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(C).\n\nA \"violent felony\" is defined in subsection 924(e)(2) as follows:\n\n            [T]he term \"violent felony\" means any crime\n            punishable   by  imprisonment   for   a   term\n            exceeding one year, or any act of juvenile\n            delinquency involving the use or carrying of a\n            firearm, knife, or destructive device that\n            would be punishable by imprisonment for such\n            term if committed by an adult, that –\n                 (i) has as an element the use, attempted\n            use, or threatened use of physical force\n            against the person of another[.]\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B).   Ellis' criminal record shows a previous\n\njuvenile adjudication for assault and battery with a dangerous\n\nweapon (a handgun).    Whether this juvenile adjudication qualifies\n\nas a \"violent felony,\" however, depends on whether it was an act of\n\njuvenile    delinquency   that   would   have   been   \"punishable   by\n\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" if committed by an\n\nadult.     Subsection 921(a)(20) of Title 18 provides that certain\n\ncrimes are not considered to be crimes \"punishable by imprisonment\n\nfor a term exceeding one year\".\n\n            What constitutes a conviction of such a crime\n            shall be determined in accordance with the law\n            of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings\n            were held.    Any conviction which has been\n            expunged, or set aside or for which a person\n            has been pardoned or has had civil rights\n            restored shall not be considered a conviction\n            for purposes of this chapter, unless such\n            pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil\n            rights expressly provides that the person may\n            not ship, transport, possess, or receive\n            firearms.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20).\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f          Ellis contends that his juvenile adjudication for assault\n\nand battery with a dangerous weapon was \"set aside\" by operation of\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 120, § 21.   That statute provides:\n\n          Whenever a person committed to the department\n          [of Youth Services] by a court upon conviction\n          of a crime is discharged from its control such\n          discharge shall, when so ordered by the\n          department, restore such person to all civil\n          rights and shall have the effect of setting\n          aside the conviction.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 120, § 21.   Although the Massachusetts statute\n\nin question only sets aside a juvenile adjudication \"when so\n\nordered by the department [of Youth Services]\", Ellis did not\n\npresent any evidence or documentation in the district court to show\n\nthat the Department of Youth Services did, in fact, set aside his\n\njuvenile adjudication.   He takes the position that any such set-\n\naside is automatic; essentially, then, he argues that the statutory\n\nlanguage in question (i.e., \"when so ordered by the department\") is\n\nsuperfluous.   The government has not contested this position on\n\nappeal, and we bypass it.\n\n          Even if a juvenile adjudication is automatically \"set\n\naside\" upon discharge from control of the Department of Youth\n\nServices, that adjudication is not set aside for all purposes.   In\n\nparticular, the adjudication still may be considered in any future\n\ncriminal proceedings against the individual.   See Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 120, § 21 (\"A commitment to the department shall not be\n\nreceived in evidence or used in any way in any proceeding in any\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fcourt [] except in imposing sentence in any criminal proceeding\n\nagainst the same person.\") (emphasis added).           Given that state law\n\nprovides that juvenile adjudications are not \"set aside\" for the\n\npurpose of imposing sentence in later criminal proceedings against\n\nthe individual, it is far from clear that Massachusetts juvenile\n\nconvictions should never be treated as predicate offenses under the\n\nACCA.     Accordingly, it was not blatant error for the sentencing\n\ncourt to take Ellis' juvenile adjudication into consideration for\n\nthe purpose of applying the ACCA.\n\n            We do not purport to decide at this juncture whether\n\nMassachusetts juvenile adjudications for violent crimes should ever\n\nbe treated as predicate offenses under the ACCA.            We only decide\n\nthat, given the procedural posture of this case, there was no\n\nblatant    error   in   treating   Ellis'   juvenile    adjudication   as   a\n\npredicate offense.\n\n            Affirmed.    See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f",
