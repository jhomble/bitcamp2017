This  is an  appeal of  the district\n                     \n\ncourt's judgment of contempt.  We affirm.\n\n                    I.  Background  \n                                  \n\n          On November  6, 1992, a subpoena to  testify and to\n\nproduce certain documents  before a grand jury  was issued to\n\n\"John  Doe, Jr.\" (\"Doe\").1    The subpoena apparently related\n\nto the restaurant and  lounge where Doe worked and  which was\n\nowned  by Doe's  parents.   Doe's  attorney, Richard  Egbert,\n\ninformed  Assistant United States  Attorney Fred  Wyshak that\n\nDoe  was  not an  authorized  officer of  the  restaurant and\n\nlounge.  Nevertheless, Egbert agreed to provide the documents\n\nsought, but he told Wyshak in a letter that  Doe would refuse\n\nto answer any questions before the grand jury, relying on his\n\nFifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself.  \n\n            Pursuant to 18 U.S.C.   6001 et seq., Wyshak then\n\nsought  Justice  Department  authorization  to  apply to  the\n\ndistrict  court  for  an  immunity order  compelling  Doe  to\n\ntestify.   Wyshak's application  named \"John Doe\"  (not \"John\n\nDoe,  Jr.\") as the witness  for whom immunity  was sought and\n\nprovided  Doe's  birthdate  and  social  security  number  as\n\nidentifying  information.    The  Deputy  Assistant  Attorney\n\nGeneral of  the Criminal  Division of the  Justice Department\n\napproved Wyshak's request.  On January 15, 1993, the district\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  subpoena was  issued  in the  appellant's name.   We\nfollow  the  government's lead,  however,  and  refer to  the\nappellant in this opinion by the pseudonym Doe.  \n\n                             -2-\n\ncourt issued its order  directing \"John Doe\" (not  \"John Doe,\n\nJr.\")  to  testify before  the grand  jury  under a  grant of\n\nimmunity.  Thereafter, a  second subpoena ordering \"John Doe\"\n\nto appear on January  28 and the court's immunity  order were\n\ndelivered in hand to Doe.     The  day  before  Doe   was  to\n\ntestify, his attorney moved the court to continue Doe's grand\n\njury appearance.   As grounds for  the motion, Egbert  stated\n\nthat  a conflict in  his continued representation  of Doe had\n\narisen, requiring Doe to find new counsel, and that Doe would\n\nbe out of the state on vacation on the date he was ordered to\n\nappear.    Egbert  did  not  object  to  the  fact  that  the\n\ndesignation  \"Jr.\" was not used after Doe's name in the court\n\norder or in  the January  subpoena.  (Indeed,  his motion  to\n\ncontinue Doe's  grand jury  appearance began \"Now  comes John\n                                                             \n\nDoe, and  respectfully requests [a continuance  of] the Grand\n   \n\nJury appearance of Mr.  Doe . . . .\" (our emphasis))  After a\n\nhearing, the district court continued Doe's appearance  until\n\nlate February.  Doe  subsequently informed the agent who  had\n\nserved him with the subpoena and court order that he would be\n\nconsulting with  Egbert and would appear  as scheduled before\n\nthe grand jury.  \n\n          On  February  25,  1993,  Doe appeared  before  the\n\ndistrict  court, accompanied by  new counsel, Joseph Balliro,\n\nJr.   He claimed that his  name was \"John Doe,  Jr.\" and that\n\nthe \"John Doe\" named in the court order was his  father.  The\n\n                             -3-\n\ncourt held a hearing, during which  Balliro conceded that the\n\nsocial security number  and date of birth in  the application\n\nwere those of  Doe and not his father.   The court found that\n\nthe John Doe, who was then present before the court,  and who\n\nhad been  identified by  social security  number and  date of\n\nbirth in  Wyshak's application  for immunity, was  the person\n\nwhom  the court  had  ordered to  testify  under a  grant  of\n\nimmunity.  The court  also pointed out that the same John Doe\n\nhad  been the one who had invoked Fifth Amendment rights, and\n\nwho had sought to continue his appearance without challenging\n\neither the  January subpoena  or the court's  immunity order.\n\nConsequently, the court found that the immunity order applied\n\nto Doe.  At the  end of the hearing, it  specifically assured\n\nDoe  that \"you  have  been granted  immunity\"  and also  told\n\nBalliro that \"anything he says cannot be used against him nor\n\ncan it lead  to any evidence that could be used against him.\"\n\n          Doe then appeared before the grand jury and refused\n\nto  testify.   The  government petitioned  for a  judgment of\n\ncontempt,  which  the court  granted.    During the  contempt\n\nhearing, Balliro  agreed that \"there [was  no] question\" that\n\nDoe was the man who was  supposed to testify, but stated that\n\n\"I'm here to  suggest to you that  the technical requirements\n\nof the [immunity statute] have not been complied with, that's\n\nall.\"  After the court assured Doe once more that he had been\n\n                             -4-\n\nimmunized and could  not be prosecuted  because of his  grand\n\njury testimony,  Doe again  declined to testify.   The  court\n\nthen found  Doe to be in  contempt of the court's  order, and\n\ndenied his request  for bail  and/or a stay  of the  contempt\n\norder pending appeal.   The next day  Doe moved the  court to\n\nstay its contempt order  pending decision on his accompanying\n\nmotion for disclosure of  information regarding the selection\n\nof  the grand jury, asserting  that the order  to testify and\n\nthe  contempt judgment would be invalid if the grand jury had\n\nnot  been  \"duly\"  empanelled.   The  court  denied the  stay\n\nmotion.   \n\n          Doe  appealed  the  district  court's  judgment  of\n\ncontempt and moved in this court for bail pending appeal.  We\n\ndenied the motion for bail pending appeal.  We now affirm the\n\njudgment of contempt.     \n\n                    II.  Discussion  \n                                   \n\n          A.  Alleged Misnaming of Doe in the Immunity Order\n                                                            \n\n          Doe  argues that  the requirements  of 18  U.S.C.  \n\n6001 et seq. were violated technically when the court ordered\n\n\"John  Doe\" and  not \"John  Doe, Jr.\"  to testify  before the\n\ngrand  jury, and  that  strict compliance  with the  immunity\n\nstatute is required since Doe's refusal to testify led to his\n\nincarceration.  He further suggests  that the court could not\n\n\"amend\"  its immunity order to  clarify that Doe  and not his\n\nfather  had been  ordered to  testify since  the  decision to\n\n                             -5-\n\ngrant or  withhold immunity  is the exclusive  prerogative of\n\nthe  executive branch.   Finally,  he states  that he  had no\n\nobligation to inform the government that it had immunized the\n\nwrong  person and that he therefore could not have waived any\n\nargument  by not  doing  so.2   Doe's  arguments are  without\n\nmerit.  \n\n          As counsel  for Doe conceded, there  is no question\n\nthat John  Doe, Jr. and not his father is the witness who was\n\nsubpoenaed to testify before  the grand jury and who  refused\n\nto  do so  on  the  basis  of  his  privilege  against  self-\n\nincrimination.   The first  subpoena issued in  November 1992\n\nwas  addressed  to  \"John Doe,  Jr.\"    In  response to  that\n\nsubpoena, Doe's attorney notified  AUSA Wyshak by letter that\n\n\"John Doe,  Jr. . .  . would  refuse to answer  any questions\n\n[before  the  grand  jury]  relying on  his  Fifth  Amendment\n\nprivilege.\"    Doe's  refusal  to  testify prompted  Wyshak's\n\napplication  for   authorization  to  seek   a  court   order\n\ncompelling Doe's testimony.  \n\n          Obviously,  the government  has some  obligation to\n\ncorrectly identify the witness  subject to an immunity order.\n\nThe underlying justification for  requiring a witness to give\n\nup  his  constitutional privilege  against self-incrimination\n\nand  compelling him to testify  under a grant  of immunity is\n\n                    \n\n2.  In view of our disposition of Doe's misnomer argument, we\ndo not address his waiver argument.  \n\n                             -6-\n\nthat the grant  of immunity  will protect  that witness  from\n\nprosecution  based  on  his  compelled  testimony except,  of\n\ncourse, for  perjury.   Kastigar v.  United States,  406 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n441, 449, 453 (1972).   Therefore, we assume that  a witness,\n\nbased  on  his  constitutional   privilege  not  to  have  to\n\nincriminate himself, may require the government to show that,\n\nif he is compelled to testify under a court order,  he is the\n\none who will receive the  protection of the immunity  granted\n\nby the order.  \n\n          If we had any concern that  Doe could be prosecuted\n\non  the basis of his compelled testimony (except for perjury)\n\nbecause the grant of  immunity at issue here did  not clearly\n\napply to  him, we would likely vacate  the contempt judgment.\n\nBut, on this record, we have no such doubt.  Clearly, Doe was\n\nthe person  who had been  immunized, and  all parties  agreed\n\nthat he was  the person immunized.  The application submitted\n\nto  the Department of  Justice sought immunity  for the \"John\n\nDoe\"  who had  Doe's  (and not  his  father's) birthdate  and\n\nsocial security number.  At the  hearing, the court confirmed\n\nthat it had intended to issue its order to that John Doe, who\n\nhad been the only  Doe active in this matter  since the first\n\nsubpoena had  issued in November, and  the court specifically\n\ntold Doe  and his counsel  that Doe was the  one immunized by\n\nthe order.   Furthermore, the  government willingly  concedes\n\n                             -7-\n\nthat Doe is covered by the grant of immunity at issue in this\n\ncase. \n\n          Since the  record plainly shows  that the  immunity\n\norder pertained to Doe and not to his father, the  failure of\n\nthe immunity application and the court's order to include the\n\ndesignation  \"Jr.\" after  Doe's name  is of  no significance.\n\nThat this is  so is also shown readily  by reference to cases\n\namending  indictments which misstated  the defendants' names.\n                     \n\nSee, e.g., Faust v.  United States, 163 U.S. 452,  452 (1896)\n                                  \n\n(indictment naming  \"W.J. Foust\" instead of  \"W.J. Faust\" was\n\nnot material variance); United States v. Mason, 869 F.2d 414,\n                                              \n\n417 (8th Cir.) (district court properly amended indictment of\n\n\"John H. Borton\" to read \"John R. Borton\" where the defendant\n\nacknowledged that the grand jury  had intended to indict him,\n\nthe amendment did not change the substance of the indictment,\n\nand  defendant had  not  been prejudiced  by the  amendment),\n\ncert.  denied, 492 U.S.  907 (1989);  United States  v. Young\n                                                             \n\nBrothers,  Inc., 728  F.2d  682, 693  (5th  Cir.) (the  court\n               \n\nproperly  amended  a  misnomer  in an  indictment  where  the\n\ndefendant's rights  were not  affected and the  defendant had\n\nbeen adequately apprised of  the charges, preventing surprise\n\nat  trial or  subsequent prosecution  for the  same offense),\n\ncert.  denied, 469  U.S.  881 (1984);  cf.  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nAlessi,  638 F.2d 466, 477-79 (2d  Cir. 1980) (the government\n      \n\nhad shown  that defendant  \"Gaetano Carcone\" was  the \"Thomas\n\n                             -8-\n\nCarcone\" indicted by showing that the grand jury had intended\n\nto indict the person who had the defendant's phone number and\n\naddress).  \n\n          We do not agree  that the court's confirmation that\n\nJohn Doe,  Jr. was  the John  Doe in  its  order usurped  the\n\nUnited States  Attorney's right to determine  that Doe should\n\nbe immunized.    The  record makes  clear  that  the  process\n\nwhereby  Doe received  immunity was  initiated by  the United\n\nStates Attorney  pursuant  to his  determination  that  Doe's\n\ntestimony  was necessary  and that  Doe should  be immunized.\n\nMoreover, we have no  doubt that the court could  clarify any\n\nambiguity in its own order.  A court need not issue a written\n\nimmunity  order  under the  statute,  but may  issue  an oral\n\norder.  See United States v.  Lach, 874 F.2d 1543, 1547 (11th\n                                  \n\nCir.  1989); United States v.  Leyva, 513 F.2d  774, 776 (5th\n                                    \n\nCir. 1975).  If the court  may grant an oral immunity  order,\n\nthen  certainly it has  full authority to  clarify orally any\n\nalleged  ambiguity in a written order it has issued under the\n\nstatute.3     Finally, we  think it  apparent from  the birth\n\ndate  and  social  security  number that  the  Department  of\n\nJustice intended to approve immunity for Doe, rather than his\n\nfather, and we reject the suggestion that the district  court\n\n                    \n\n3.  In view of our disposition of  this point, we see no need\nto determine  whether the  court \"amended\" its  written order\nduring  the hearing  as Doe  claims, or  whether it  issued a\nseparate oral order which rendered \"any alleged defect in the\nwritten order . . . a nullity\" as the government suggests.   \n\n                             -9-\n\nin  any way infringed on  the authority of  the Department to\n\ndecide who should be immunized.   \n\n               B.  Selection of the Grand Jury\n                                              \n\n          Doe's argument that he is entitled to challenge the\n\ncomposition of the grand jury and thus entitled to disclosure\n\nof  such information is also meritless.  Doe asserts that the\n\ncourt's failure  to permit him to  discover information about\n\nthe  composition of  the  grand jury  violated his  statutory\n\nrights  under  the  Jury  Selection and  Service  Act  (\"Jury\n\nSelection  Act\"), 28  U.S.C.    1861 et  seq., and  under the\n\nConstitution. \n\n          Doe  appears to  find  support  for  his  statutory\n\nargument  in Test v. United  States, 420 U.S.  28 (1975) (per\n                                   \n\ncuriam), in  which the  Supreme Court  held that  a convicted\n\ndefendant  had the right to inspect  jury lists pertaining to\n\nthe grand jury which indicted him and to a pending petit jury\n\nin his case.   The Court  found that  section 1867(f) of  the\n\nJury Selection Act gives a \"litigant\" an unqualified right to\n\ninspect  jury lists.  In  a footnote, which  Doe seizes upon,\n\nthe Supreme Court essentially  defined the term \"litigant\" to\n\nmean \"the United States and the defendant in a criminal case,\n\nand . . . any party in a civil case.\"  \n\n          The  Court's language, taken  out of context, might\n\nsuggest that  a civil  contemnor like  Doe is a  \"party in  a\n\ncivil  case\" who would have  a right to  challenge grand jury\n\n                             -10-\n\nselection procedures.  (We assume that it is obvious that Doe\n\nis  not a  \"defendant in a  criminal case.\")   Even a cursory\n\nreading  of   the  statute,  however,  shows   that  such  an\n\ninterpretation  would be  wrong.   The provision  in question\n\npermits  parties  in civil  cases in  which  a petit  jury is\n                                                             \n\nempanelled  to challenge  jury selection  procedures, see  28\n                                                         \n\nU.S.C.   1867(c), and  so does not  apply to persons held  in\n\ncivil  contempt by a  court or witnesses  testifying before a\n\ngrand jury.      \n\n          Indeed, Doe's  argument that he  may challenge  the\n\ncomposition  or selection of the grand jury has no support at\n\nall in case law.  As  far as we have been able to  determine,\n\nall  courts which  have considered  this question,  including\n\nthis  court, have  held that  a recalcitrant  witness has  no\n\nstanding  to challenge  the composition  or selection  of the\n\ngrand jury, whether under the Jury Selection Act or under the\n\nConstitution.   See In re  Maury Santiago, 533  F.2d 727, 730\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir.  1976) (a recalcitrant  witness has no  standing to\n\nchallenge the composition of a grand  jury); United States v.\n                                                          \n\nDuncan,  456  F.2d  1401,  1403 (9th  Cir.)

This  is an  appeal of  the district\n                     \n\ncourt's judgment of contempt.  We affirm.\n\n                    I.  Background  \n                                  \n\n          On November  6, 1992, a subpoena to  testify and to\n\nproduce certain documents  before a grand jury  was issued to\n\n\"John  Doe, Jr.\" (\"Doe\").1    The subpoena apparently related\n\nto the restaurant and  lounge where Doe worked and  which was\n\nowned  by Doe's  parents.   Doe's  attorney, Richard  Egbert,\n\ninformed  Assistant United States  Attorney Fred  Wyshak that\n\nDoe  was  not an  authorized  officer of  the  restaurant and\n\nlounge.  Nevertheless, Egbert agreed to provide the documents\n\nsought, but he told Wyshak in a letter that  Doe would refuse\n\nto answer any questions before the grand jury, relying on his\n\nFifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself.  \n\n            Pursuant to 18 U.S.C.   6001 et seq., Wyshak then\n\nsought  Justice  Department  authorization  to  apply to  the\n\ndistrict  court  for  an  immunity order  compelling  Doe  to\n\ntestify.   Wyshak's application  named \"John Doe\"  (not \"John\n\nDoe,  Jr.\") as the witness  for whom immunity  was sought and\n\nprovided  Doe's  birthdate  and  social  security  number  as\n\nidentifying  information.    The  Deputy  Assistant  Attorney\n\nGeneral of  the Criminal  Division of the  Justice Department\n\napproved Wyshak's request.  On January 15, 1993, the district\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  subpoena was  issued  in the  appellant's name.   We\nfollow  the  government's lead,  however,  and  refer to  the\nappellant in this opinion by the pseudonym Doe.  \n\n                             -2-\n\ncourt issued its order  directing \"John Doe\" (not  \"John Doe,\n\nJr.\")  to  testify before  the grand  jury  under a  grant of\n\nimmunity.  Thereafter, a  second subpoena ordering \"John Doe\"\n\nto appear on January  28 and the court's immunity  order were\n\ndelivered in hand to Doe.     The  day  before  Doe   was  to\n\ntestify, his attorney moved the court to continue Doe's grand\n\njury appearance.   As grounds for  the motion, Egbert  stated\n\nthat  a conflict in  his continued representation  of Doe had\n\narisen, requiring Doe to find new counsel, and that Doe would\n\nbe out of the state on vacation on the date he was ordered to\n\nappear.    Egbert  did  not  object  to  the  fact  that  the\n\ndesignation  \"Jr.\" was not used after Doe's name in the court\n\norder or in  the January  subpoena.  (Indeed,  his motion  to\n\ncontinue Doe's  grand jury  appearance began \"Now  comes John\n                                                             \n\nDoe, and  respectfully requests [a continuance  of] the Grand\n   \n\nJury appearance of Mr.  Doe . . . .\" (our emphasis))  After a\n\nhearing, the district court continued Doe's appearance  until\n\nlate February.  Doe  subsequently informed the agent who  had\n\nserved him with the subpoena and court order that he would be\n\nconsulting with  Egbert and would appear  as scheduled before\n\nthe grand jury.  \n\n          On  February  25,  1993,  Doe appeared  before  the\n\ndistrict  court, accompanied by  new counsel, Joseph Balliro,\n\nJr.   He claimed that his  name was \"John Doe,  Jr.\" and that\n\nthe \"John Doe\" named in the court order was his  father.  The\n\n                             -3-\n\ncourt held a hearing, during which  Balliro conceded that the\n\nsocial security number  and date of birth in  the application\n\nwere those of  Doe and not his father.   The court found that\n\nthe John Doe, who was then present before the court,  and who\n\nhad been  identified by  social security  number and  date of\n\nbirth in  Wyshak's application  for immunity, was  the person\n\nwhom  the court  had  ordered to  testify  under a  grant  of\n\nimmunity.  The court  also pointed out that the same John Doe\n\nhad  been the one who had invoked Fifth Amendment rights, and\n\nwho had sought to continue his appearance without challenging\n\neither the  January subpoena  or the court's  immunity order.\n\nConsequently, the court found that the immunity order applied\n\nto Doe.  At the  end of the hearing, it  specifically assured\n\nDoe  that \"you  have  been granted  immunity\"  and also  told\n\nBalliro that \"anything he says cannot be used against him nor\n\ncan it lead  to any evidence that could be used against him.\"\n\n          Doe then appeared before the grand jury and refused\n\nto  testify.   The  government petitioned  for a  judgment of\n\ncontempt,  which  the court  granted.    During the  contempt\n\nhearing, Balliro  agreed that \"there [was  no] question\" that\n\nDoe was the man who was  supposed to testify, but stated that\n\n\"I'm here to  suggest to you that  the technical requirements\n\nof the [immunity statute] have not been complied with, that's\n\nall.\"  After the court assured Doe once more that he had been\n\n                             -4-\n\nimmunized and could  not be prosecuted  because of his  grand\n\njury testimony,  Doe again  declined to testify.   The  court\n\nthen found  Doe to be in  contempt of the court's  order, and\n\ndenied his request  for bail  and/or a stay  of the  contempt\n\norder pending appeal.   The next day  Doe moved the  court to\n\nstay its contempt order  pending decision on his accompanying\n\nmotion for disclosure of  information regarding the selection\n\nof  the grand jury, asserting  that the order  to testify and\n\nthe  contempt judgment would be invalid if the grand jury had\n\nnot  been  \"duly\"  empanelled.   The  court  denied the  stay\n\nmotion.   \n\n          Doe  appealed  the  district  court's  judgment  of\n\ncontempt and moved in this court for bail pending appeal.  We\n\ndenied the motion for bail pending appeal.  We now affirm the\n\njudgment of contempt.     \n\n                    II.  Discussion  \n                                   \n\n          A.  Alleged Misnaming of Doe in the Immunity Order\n                                                            \n\n          Doe  argues that  the requirements  of 18  U.S.C.  \n\n6001 et seq. were violated technically when the court ordered\n\n\"John  Doe\" and  not \"John  Doe, Jr.\"  to testify  before the\n\ngrand  jury, and  that  strict compliance  with the  immunity\n\nstatute is required since Doe's refusal to testify led to his\n\nincarceration.  He further suggests  that the court could not\n\n\"amend\"  its immunity order to  clarify that Doe  and not his\n\nfather  had been  ordered to  testify since  the  decision to\n\n                             -5-\n\ngrant or  withhold immunity  is the exclusive  prerogative of\n\nthe  executive branch.   Finally,  he states  that he  had no\n\nobligation to inform the government that it had immunized the\n\nwrong  person and that he therefore could not have waived any\n\nargument  by not  doing  so.2   Doe's  arguments are  without\n\nmerit.  \n\n          As counsel  for Doe conceded, there  is no question\n\nthat John  Doe, Jr. and not his father is the witness who was\n\nsubpoenaed to testify before  the grand jury and who  refused\n\nto  do so  on  the  basis  of  his  privilege  against  self-\n\nincrimination.   The first  subpoena issued in  November 1992\n\nwas  addressed  to  \"John Doe,  Jr.\"    In  response to  that\n\nsubpoena, Doe's attorney notified  AUSA Wyshak by letter that\n\n\"John Doe,  Jr. . .  . would  refuse to answer  any questions\n\n[before  the  grand  jury]  relying on  his  Fifth  Amendment\n\nprivilege.\"    Doe's  refusal  to  testify prompted  Wyshak's\n\napplication  for   authorization  to  seek   a  court   order\n\ncompelling Doe's testimony.  \n\n          Obviously,  the government  has some  obligation to\n\ncorrectly identify the witness  subject to an immunity order.\n\nThe underlying justification for  requiring a witness to give\n\nup  his  constitutional privilege  against self-incrimination\n\nand  compelling him to testify  under a grant  of immunity is\n\n                    \n\n2.  In view of our disposition of Doe's misnomer argument, we\ndo not address his waiver argument.  \n\n                             -6-\n\nthat the grant  of immunity  will protect  that witness  from\n\nprosecution  based  on  his  compelled  testimony except,  of\n\ncourse, for  perjury.   Kastigar v.  United States,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108541\"><a href=\"/opinion/108541/kastigar-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n                                                  \n\n<span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 449, 453 (1972).   Therefore, we assume that  a witness,\n\nbased  on  his  constitutional   privilege  not  to  have  to\n\nincriminate himself, may require the government to show that,\n\nif he is compelled to testify under a court order,  he is the\n\none who will receive the  protection of the immunity  granted\n\nby the order.  \n\n          If we had any concern that  Doe could be prosecuted\n\non  the basis of his compelled testimony (except for perjury)\n\nbecause the grant of  immunity at issue here did  not clearly\n\napply to  him, we would likely vacate  the contempt judgment.\n\nBut, on this record, we have no such doubt.  Clearly, Doe was\n\nthe person  who had been  immunized, and  all parties  agreed\n\nthat he was  the person immunized.  The application submitted\n\nto  the Department of  Justice sought immunity  for the \"John\n\nDoe\"  who had  Doe's  (and not  his  father's) birthdate  and\n\nsocial security number.  At the  hearing, the court confirmed\n\nthat it had intended to issue its order to that John Doe, who\n\nhad been the only  Doe active in this matter  since the first\n\nsubpoena had  issued in November, and  the court specifically\n\ntold Doe  and his counsel  that Doe was the  one immunized by\n\nthe order.   Furthermore, the  government willingly  concedes\n\n                             -7-\n\nthat Doe is covered by the grant of immunity at issue in this\n\ncase. \n\n          Since the  record plainly shows  that the  immunity\n\norder pertained to Doe and not to his father, the  failure of\n\nthe immunity application and the court's order to include the\n\ndesignation  \"Jr.\" after  Doe's name  is of  no significance.\n\nThat this is  so is also shown readily  by reference to cases\n\namending  indictments which misstated  the defendants' names.\n                     \n\nSee, e.g., Faust v.

The Court  found that  section 1867(f) of  the\n\nJury Selection Act gives a \"litigant\" an unqualified right to\n\ninspect  jury lists.  In  a footnote, which  Doe seizes upon,\n\nthe Supreme Court essentially  defined the term \"litigant\" to\n\nmean \"the United States and the defendant in a criminal case,\n\nand . . . any party in a civil case.\"  \n\n          The  Court's language, taken  out of context, might\n\nsuggest that  a civil  contemnor like  Doe is a  \"party in  a\n\ncivil  case\" who would have  a right to  challenge grand jury\n\n                             -10-\n\nselection procedures.  (We assume that it is obvious that Doe\n\nis  not a  \"defendant in a  criminal case.\")   Even a cursory\n\nreading  of   the  statute,  however,  shows   that  such  an\n\ninterpretation  would be  wrong.

As  far as we have been able to  determine,\n\nall  courts which  have considered  this question,  including\n\nthis  court, have  held that  a recalcitrant  witness has  no\n\nstanding  to challenge  the composition  or selection  of the\n\ngrand jury, whether under the Jury Selection Act or under the\n\nConstitution.
