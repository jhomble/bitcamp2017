Plaintiff,  a former federal employee,\n                    \n\nappeals  pro se from  the district court's  decision granting\n               \n\nsummary judgment to defendant.  The district court found that\n\nplaintiff's suit was barred by her failure to comply with the\n\n30-day  limitations period  set forth  in  the Civil  Service\n\nReform Act (\"CSRA\"), 5 U.S.C.   7703(b)(2).  Plaintiff argued\n\nthat  because of  a  mental  incapacity  during  the  tolling\n\nperiod, the  district court should have permitted her suit to\n\nproceed under the doctrine of \"equitable tolling.\"  \n\n          Plaintiff's   complaint   alleged  that   she   was\n\ndischarged  from  her  position  with  the  Defense Logistics\n\nAgency (\"DLA\") after  31 years' service  because of a  mental\n\nhandicap, in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.  \n\n791.   On cross-motions for  summary judgment,  the case  was\n\nreferred to  Magistrate-Judge Ponsor.   The  magistrate found\n\nthat plaintiff had  earlier sought  administrative review  of\n\nher claim before the Merit Systems Protection Board (\"MSPB\"),\n\nas permitted  by the CSRA, 5 U.S.C.    7701, 7702.  Following\n\nan adverse  decision by  the MSPB, plaintiff  failed to  seek\n\nfurther  review in  the courts,  or in  the Equal  Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), until  well after expiration\n\nof the 30-day period  permitted for such suits in 5  U.S.C.  \n\n7703(b)(2).1   The  magistrate held  that  the CSRA's  30-day\n\n                    \n\n1.  Section 7703(b)(2) states the following:\n     Cases of  discrimination subject to  the provisions\n     of Section 7702 of this title shall  be filed under\n\n                             -2-\n\ntime  limit was  \"jurisdictional,\" and  thus  not subject  to\n\nequitable  enlargement.  Even if subject to tolling, however,\n\nthe  magistrate held  that  plaintiff  was  not  entitled  to\n\nequitable  relief.   Plaintiff  objected to  the magistrate's\n\nlegal  conclusions,  moved  to  supplement  the  record  with\n\nadditional   affidavits,  and   renewed  a   motion   for  an\n\nevidentiary    hearing.    The   district    judge    allowed\n\nsupplementation, but declined to hold an evidentiary hearing.\n\nWithout directly ruling on the amenability  of the statute to\n\ntolling, the district judge held that even if tolling were an\n\navailable legal option, plaintiff's mental illness would  not\n\nwarrant enlargement of the limitations period.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Under   the   Rehabilitation  Act,   29   U.S.C.   \n\n794a(a)(1), claims of handicap discrimination are governed by\n\nthe procedure set forth in Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act\n\nof 1964, as amended  by the Equal Employment  Opportunity Act\n\n(\"EEOA\"),  42  U.S.C.    2000e-16.    Since  plaintiff was  a\n\n                    \n\n         717(c)  of the  Civil  Rights Act  of 1964  (42\n     U.S.C.  2000e-16(c),  section   15(c)  of  the  Age\n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C.\n     633a(c))  and  section  16(b)  of  the  Fair  Labor\n     Standards  Act  of  1938,  as  amended  (29  U.S.C.\n     216(b)), as applicable.   Notwithstanding any other\n     provision of  law, any  such case  filed under  any\n     such section must be filed within 30 days after the\n     date the individual filing the case received notice\n     of the  judicially reviewable action  under section\n     7702.\n\n                             -3-\n\nclassified  civil   service  employee,  her  claim   is  also\n\ncontrolled  by   the  procedures   established  for   federal\n\nemployees under the CSRA.\n\n          The  Supreme Court  has  ruled that  the  statutory\n\nfiling  deadline applicable  to federal employee  suits under\n\nthe EEOA, 42  U.S.C.   2000e-16(c),2 are subject to equitable\n\ntolling.  Irwin v. Veteran's Admin. Regional Office, 498 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n89, 111 S.  Ct. 453 (1990).   While the opinion presents some\n\ninterpretive difficulties,  it states  that statutory  filing\n\ndeadlines governing suits against the Government \"are subject\n\nto  the  same  rebuttable  presumption  of  equitable tolling\n\napplicable  to suits against private defendants.\"  Irwin, 111\n                                                        \n\nS.

Together  the  two statutes\n                              \n\n                    \n\n2.   42 U.S.C.   2000e-16(c) provided in relevant part:\n     Within  thirty days [now ninety days] of receipt of\n     notice  of  final  action taken  by  a  department,\n     agency,  or unit referred  to in subsection  (a) of\n     this section, or by the  [EEOC] upon an appeal from\n     a decision or  order of such department,  agency or\n     unit  on a complaint of discrimination ... or after\n     one hundred  and eighty days from the filing of the\n     initial charge with the [agency] or with the [EEOC]\n     on appeal from  a decision ... of  such department,\n     agency or unit ...  an  employee or  applicant  for\n     employment, if  aggrieved by the  final disposition\n     of  his complaint, or by  the failure to take final\n     action on his complaint, may file a civil action as\n     provided in section 2000e-5 of this title ....\n\n                             -4-\n\nprovide a series of interdependent supplementary and parallel\n\nchannels for federal employees seeking administrative  review\n\nof claims alleging prohibited discrimination.3   The statutes\n\nexpressly  cross-reference  one   another,  conditioning  the\n\nnumber and  sequence of  open avenues  of administrative  and\n\ncourt review on  the employee's status and the  nature of the\n\n                    \n\n3.  The  interdependence of  the two  statutes  is rooted  in\ntheir histories, which  have been well  documented elsewhere.\nThe provision at issue in Irwin,   717 of the EEOA, 42 U.S.C.\n                               \n   2000e-16, was  added  to  the civil  rights  laws in  1972\nbecause  Congress was persuaded that federal employees had no\neffective  administrative and  judicial remedies.   Brown  v.\n                                                         \nGeneral Servs.  Adm., 425  U.S. 820, 825-31  (1976).   It was\n                    \nthen administered  by the  Civil Service  Commission (\"CSC\"),\nand contained the exclusive administrative remedy for federal\nemployee discrimination claims.  Brown,  425 U.S. at 820.  In\n                                      \n1978, however, responding  to continued discontent,  Congress\ntransferred jurisdiction over federal employee discrimination\nclaims  brought under  the EEOA  from  the CSC  to the  EEOC.\nCongress  also adopted  the  CSRA,  abolished  the  CSC,  and\nestablished the  MSPB, as one  of two agencies in  its place.\nSee generally Barbara  L. Schlei &amp; Paul  Grossman, Employment\n                                                             \nDiscrimination  Law   1188-90  (2d   ed.  1983)   (collecting\n                   \nlegislative history).  Although  the CSRA and EEOA contain  a\ndivision of jurisdiction  between the two agencies,  there is\nalso substantial interplay  and overlap.   5  U.S.C.    7702.\nDepending on status and type of claim, federal  employees may\nhave  up to five options for pursuing a discrimination claim.\n5  U.S.C.      7701,  7702,  7121.    See  Lee  M.  Modjeska,\n                                         \nEmployment Discrimination  Law     2.7  (2d Ed.  supp. 1991).\n                              \nThe legislative history to   7703(b)(2) seems  to contain few\nclues   indicating  any  separate   purpose  for  the  30-day\ndeadline, see,  e.g., S. Rep.  No. 969, 95th Cong.,  2d Sess.\n                    \n63-64, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N.  2723, 2785-86.  And in\n                   \n1991, when  Congress increased  from 30 to  90 days  the time\nallotted for judicial  review under 42 U.S.C.    2000e-16(c),\nit simply   assumed that the  new time limits would  apply to\nall  federal  employees  with Title  VII  claims  against the\nfederal government. Sen.  Rep. on  Pub. L.  No. 102-166  114,\nreprinted in 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 549, 623.   \n            \n\n                             -5-\n\nclaim.   42 U.S.C.    2000e-16(a) to  (c); 5 U.S.C.     7701-\n\n7703.  \n\n          Plaintiff  here  initially  sought  review  of  her\n\ntermination  before   the  Merit  Systems   Protection  Board\n\n(\"MSPB\").  5 U.S.C.    7701,  7702.4   Her case was  assigned\n\nto an administrative judge who affirmed the agency.  She then\n\nhad an option  to seek further review before  the MSPB's full\n\nBoard, a district  court, or the EEOC.  She  chose full Board\n\nreview, and her petition was denied.   Again, plaintiff faced\n\nan option.  She had thirty days to seek review in  a district\n\ncourt or  in the EEOC.   5 U.S.C.    7703(b)(2), 42  U.S.C.  \n\n2000e-16(c).    It  was  at  this  juncture,  the  government\n\ncontends, that she took a  late step not subject to equitable\n\ntolling.   She filed her  petition with the EEOC  nine months\n\nlate (which  the  EEOC  treated as  an  untimely  appeal  and\n\ndenied) and  filed in the  district court a little  more than\n\nthree months  after that.   Had  plaintiff instead  initially\n\nsought EEOC  review, and then taken a late step from the EEOC\n                             \n\n                    \n\n4.  As a permanent employee covered by 5 U.S.C.   7511(a)(1),\nplaintiff  here  seems to  have  had  an  initial  option  of\npursuing her  disability  discrimination  claim  through  the\nagency's EEO grievance procedure with  a choice of appeal  to\neither the EEOC  or the MSPB, or bringing  her claim directly\nto the  MSPB.  If she  was subject to  a bargaining agreement\nwith a  grievance procedure,  she would  have had  additional\noptions.  5 U.S.C.     7103, 7111, 7121, 7701-7702; 42 U.S.C.\n  2000e-16(a) to (c).  See Viniertos v. United States, 939 F.\n                                                     \n2d 762, 767-768  (9th Cir. 1991) (describing options  open to\nfederal employees  under Labor-Management Relations Act).  It\nis not clear  to us by which method plaintiff's case began in\nthe DLA, but no issue has been raised concerning it. \n\n                             -6-\n\nto court,  the case  would have been  on all  fours with  the\n\nfacts in Irwin.  \n              \n\n          We see no  principled reason for failing  to extend\n\nIrwin's   rebuttable  presumption   to  the   instant  filing\n       \n\ndeadline.   The  only  arguments to  the contrary  below were\n\nsimilar to those  rejected in Irwin,  and the government  has\n                                   \n\nnot renewed them here.  Allowing equitable tolling of one but\n\nnot  the other  of  these  interrelated administrative  steps\n\ncould encourage untoward forum shopping,  especially in light\n\nof the short time periods  involved.  Cf. Johnson v.

King's  conclusion  that  5  U.S.C.     7703(b)(2)  was\n            \n\"jurisdictional\" and  thus not  subject to  equitable tolling\nwas based on  earlier cases holding other  time provisions in\nthe CSRA \"jurisdictional,\" and interpretations of the instant\nstatutory language similar to the those rejected in Irwin.   \n                                                         \nWe do not  have before us any  other section of the  CSRA and\nmust, in  any  event,  follow Irwin's  adoption  of  a  \"more\n                                   \ngeneral  rule,\"  presuming  that  once  Congress  has  waived\nsovereign  immunity, there is \"little, if any, broadening\" of\n\n                             -8-\n\n                                II.\n\n          While Irwin  increased  the number  of statutes  to\n                     \n\nwhich equitable  tolling may  be applied,  it cautioned  that\n\nfederal courts have \"typically extended equitable relief only\n\nsparingly.\"    Irwin,  111  S.  Ct.  at  457.    Relief  from\n                    \n\nlimitations  periods through  equitable tolling  thus remains\n\nsubject to careful case-by-case scrutiny.        \n\n          Plaintiff's  argument for  equitable tolling  below\n\nwas based on the debilitating effects of her alleged insanity\n\nduring  the filing  period.   We  have declined  to adopt  an\n\n\"absolute  rule of  tolling on insanity  grounds.\"   Lopez v.\n                                                          \n\nCitibank, N.A., 808 F.2d 905, 906 (1st Cir. 1987).  Moreover,\n              \n\nsince the plaintiff in Lopez had been actively represented by\n                            \n\ncounsel  in  administrative  proceedings  during his  alleged\n\nperiod of illness, we held: \n\n     It   ...  seems   unlikely  [plaintiff's]   illness\n     deprived his  counsel of  the knowledge  or consent\n     needed  to  file  a court  complaint  ....  In such\n     circumstances, we  believe a  federal court  should\n     assume  that the mental  illness was not  of a sort\n     that  makes it equitable to  toll the statute -- at\n     least  absent  a  strong reason  for  believing the\n     contrary.    \n\n                    \n\nthe  waiver by subjecting  the statute to  equitable tolling.\nIrwin, 111 U.S.  at 457.  We  note, too, that the  King court\n                                                       \ndid not face the precise statutory incongruity we  face here,\nsince it had earlier determined the time limit in 42 U.S.C.  \n2000e-16(c),  too, was \"jurisdictional.\"   King, 782  F.2d at\n                                               \n274  n.3.   The latter  decision  has now  been overruled  by\nIrwin. \n     \n\n                             -9-\n\nLopez,  808 F.2d at  907.  Lopez,  however, did not  adopt an\n                                \n\nabsolute  rule  against tolling  every limitations  period on\n                       \n\ninsanity grounds in  all circumstances.   The cases cited  by\n\nthe   district  court  which  suggest  such  a  bar  involved\n\ndifferent statutes  and substantive concerns,  with typically\n\nlonger limitations periods. \n\n          In   holding  that   mental  illness   provides  an\n\navailable ground  for equitable tolling here, we note that we\n\nare dealing with a broad remedial statute, the Rehabilitation\n\nAct  of 1973.   Cf.  Bassett v.  Sterling Drug, Inc.,  578 F.\n                                                    \n\nSupp.  1244, 1246-47 (S.D. Ohio 1984) (mental incompetence is\n\nmore  appropriate basis for equitable tolling under ADEA than\n\nunder Federal  Tort Claims Act).6   Moreover, we deal  with a\n\ncase  in which  mental  illness or  instability is  \"the very\n\ndisability that forms  ... the basis  for which the  claimant\n\nseeks [relief].\"  Canales v.  Sullivan, 936 F.2d 755, 758 (2d\n                                      \n\nCir. 1991) (quoting Elchediak  v. Heckler, 750 F.2d 892,  894\n                                         \n\n(11th Cir.  1985)) (SSDI  benefit proceeding).   Under  these\n\ncircumstances,  we think  an absolute rule  barring equitable\n\ntolling  for a plaintiff's  insanity might conflict  with the\n\n                    \n\n6.  The district  court relied  in part  on caselaw  language\ndirected at limitations periods  in a variety of other  areas\nincluding  the Federal  Torts Claim  Act  and the  Securities\nExchange  Act of  1934, where  plaintiffs  urged that  mental\ndisabilities  prevented them from discovering a tort or fraud\nfor  more than several years.  Different substantive concerns\nand the purposes  of the limitations provisions in such cases\nmay dictate a different result.  Our holding is confined only\nto the statute and claim before us.\n\n                             -10-\n\nsubstantive purposes  of the  Act.  Finally,  we deal  with a\n\nvery short filing period, thirty days.  \n\n          In  closely  analogous  contexts,  similarly  short\n\nfiling  periods  under  the  EEOA  have  been  recognized  as\n\namenable  to tolling on insanity grounds,  albeit only if the\n\nfederal employee's proof  passes very rigorous tests.   These\n\ncases, like  Lopez, eschew  reliance solely  on a  diagnosis.\n                  \n\nRather,  they analogize  to state  standards for  determining\n\nincompetence,  inquiring whether  the particular  plaintiff's\n\nillness  rendered him  \"unable to  protect  his legal  rights\n\nbecause  of an  overall inability  to  function in  society,\"\n\nDecrosta v. Runyon, 1993 U.S. Dist.

Equitable  relief is  denied if  the\n\nplaintiff   was  able  to  engage  in  rational  thought  and\n\ndeliberate  decision making  sufficient to  pursue  his claim\n\nalone or through counsel.

In  addition to the recent cases\nmentioned   in  the  text,  in  other  contexts  courts  have\nconsidered the merits of equitable tolling claims on insanity\ngrounds  since Irwin.   See,  e.g., Char v.  Matson Terminals\n                                                             \nInc., 1992 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 21077 (D.

Diagnoses prior to that  time were\n\nonly of adjustment  and personality disorders.  In May, 1987,\n\nhowever, shortly after she was fired from  the DLA, plaintiff\n\nreportedly  suffered a \"schizophrenic reaction.\"  By then her\n\ncase  was  pending  before  the  MSPB.     Although  she  was\n\nrepresented  by an attorney there, she inexplicably failed to\n\nappear   for  a  scheduled  hearing  and  missed  two  filing\n\ndeadlines.    Her  then attorney  attempted  to  excuse these\n\ndefaults   as  caused   in   part   by  plaintiff's   medical\n\ndifficulties.    \n\n                    \n\n8.  Pro se filings  are held to  a less stringent  procedural\n          \nstandard than others.  See, e.g., Estelle v.

The  psychiatrist   concluded  that\n\nplaintiff's condition was of \"at least\" a year's duration.  A\n\nnon-examining psychologist  who reviewed  plaintiff's medical\n\nrecords reported  that they  all \"fit[] a  woman with  a long\n\nstanding schizophrenic disorder possibly of the paranoid type\n\nwhose life has progressively fallen  away from her due to the\n\n                    \n\n9.    Plaintiff lost  her right  to an  immediate pension  by\nvirtue of  her termination for  \"cause\" by the DLA.   She was\napparently evicted from  her apartment in what  was described\nas a \"hostile\" scene and is unable to find employment.\n\n10.  Paranoid schizophrenia is broadly defined as a psychotic\ndisorder causing hallucinations and other major  disturbances\nin  thought,  mood,   perception,  orientation,  memory,  and\nbehavior,  and characterized  by  one  or  more  systematized\ndelusions of persecution or danger.

The  social worker reported\n\nthat  she kept \"insisting  that [the social  worker] help her\n\npetition this work release  through the court system when  it\n\nhas already been done and is a  finished case.\"  In her brief\n\non appeal here  plaintiff alleges for the first  time that in\n\nfact she was not represented by counsel after the termination\n\nof the MSPB action.  \n\n          While  not  all  the evidence  points  in  the same\n\ndirection,11 we  think it sufficient,  if proved, to  raise a\n\ngenuine  issue of  fact  as  to  whether  plaintiff's  mental\n\ncondition  rendered her  incapable of  rationally cooperating\n\nwith any counsel, and/or pursuing her claim on her own during\n\nthe limitations period.  \n\n                    \n\n11.  We  note   that  despite  his  other   conclusions,  the\nexamining  psychiatrist found that plaintiff was competent to\nhandle  her  own money.    Such  a  finding might,  in  other\ncircumstances, give us pause.  However, given the evidence of\nplaintiff's  extremely  limited financial  means,  the likely\nunavailability  of  any  guardian able  or  willing  to serve\n(plaintiff is  unmarried and receives  \"general relief\"), and\ncurrent cutbacks in delivery of state  social services, we do\nnot  find it conclusive.

The  magistrate found\n\nthat plaintiff had  earlier sought  administrative review  of\n\nher claim before the Merit Systems Protection Board (\"MSPB\"),\n\nas permitted  by the CSRA, 5 U.S.C.    7701, 7702.  Following\n\nan adverse  decision by  the MSPB, plaintiff  failed to  seek\n\nfurther  review in  the courts,  or in  the Equal  Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), until  well after expiration\n\nof the 30-day period  permitted for such suits in 5  U.S.C.  \n\n7703(b)(2).1   The  magistrate held  that  the CSRA's  30-day\n\n                    \n\n1.  Section 7703(b)(2) states the following:\n     Cases of  discrimination subject to  the provisions\n     of Section 7702 of this title shall  be filed under\n\n                             -2-\n\ntime  limit was  \"jurisdictional,\" and  thus  not subject  to\n\nequitable  enlargement.  Even if subject to tolling, however,\n\nthe  magistrate held  that  plaintiff  was  not  entitled  to\n\nequitable  relief.   Plaintiff  objected to  the magistrate's\n\nlegal  conclusions,  moved  to  supplement  the  record  with\n\nadditional   affidavits,  and   renewed  a   motion   for  an\n\nevidentiary    hearing.    The   district    judge    allowed\n\nsupplementation, but declined to hold an evidentiary hearing.\n\nWithout directly ruling on the amenability  of the statute to\n\ntolling, the district judge held that even if tolling were an\n\navailable legal option, plaintiff's mental illness would  not\n\nwarrant enlargement of the limitations period.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Under   the   Rehabilitation  Act,   29   U.S.C.   \n\n794a(a)(1), claims of handicap discrimination are governed by\n\nthe procedure set forth in Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act\n\nof 1964, as amended  by the Equal Employment  Opportunity Act\n\n(\"EEOA\"),  42  U.S.C.    2000e-16.

In\n                                      \n1978, however, responding  to continued discontent,  Congress\ntransferred jurisdiction over federal employee discrimination\nclaims  brought under  the EEOA  from  the CSC  to the  EEOC.\nCongress  also adopted  the  CSRA,  abolished  the  CSC,  and\nestablished the  MSPB, as one  of two agencies in  its place.\nSee generally Barbara  L.

Sen.  Rep. on  Pub. L.

She then\n\nhad an option  to seek further review before  the MSPB's full\n\nBoard, a district  court, or the EEOC.  She  chose full Board\n\nreview, and her petition was denied.   Again, plaintiff faced\n\nan option.  She had thirty days to seek review in  a district\n\ncourt or  in the EEOC.   5 U.S.C.    7703(b)(2), 42  U.S.C.  \n\n2000e-16(c).    It  was  at  this  juncture,  the  government\n\ncontends, that she took a  late step not subject to equitable\n\ntolling.   She filed her  petition with the EEOC  nine months\n\nlate (which  the  EEOC  treated as  an  untimely  appeal  and\n\ndenied) and  filed in the  district court a little  more than\n\nthree months  after that.   Had  plaintiff instead  initially\n\nsought EEOC  review, and then taken a late step from the EEOC\n                             \n\n                    \n\n4.  As a permanent employee covered by 5 U.S.C.   7511(a)(1),\nplaintiff  here  seems to  have  had  an  initial  option  of\npursuing her  disability  discrimination  claim  through  the\nagency's EEO grievance procedure with  a choice of appeal  to\neither the EEOC  or the MSPB, or bringing  her claim directly\nto the  MSPB.  If she  was subject to  a bargaining agreement\nwith a  grievance procedure,  she would  have had  additional\noptions.  5 U.S.C.     7103, 7111, 7121, 7701-7702; 42 U.S.C.\n  2000e-16(a) to (c).

It\nis not clear  to us by which method plaintiff's case began in\nthe DLA, but no issue has been raised concerning it. \n\n                             -6-\n\nto court,  the case  would have been  on all  fours with  the\n\nfacts in Irwin.  \n              \n\n          We see no  principled reason for failing  to extend\n\nIrwin's   rebuttable  presumption   to  the   instant  filing\n       \n\ndeadline.

Under  these\n\ncircumstances,  we think  an absolute rule  barring equitable\n\ntolling  for a plaintiff's  insanity might conflict  with the\n\n                    \n\n6.  The district  court relied  in part  on caselaw  language\ndirected at limitations periods  in a variety of other  areas\nincluding  the Federal  Torts Claim  Act  and the  Securities\nExchange  Act of  1934, where  plaintiffs  urged that  mental\ndisabilities  prevented them from discovering a tort or fraud\nfor  more than several years.

Diagnoses prior to that  time were\n\nonly of adjustment  and personality disorders.  In May, 1987,\n\nhowever, shortly after she was fired from  the DLA, plaintiff\n\nreportedly  suffered a \"schizophrenic reaction.\"  By then her\n\ncase  was  pending  before  the  MSPB.     Although  she  was\n\nrepresented  by an attorney there, she inexplicably failed to\n\nappear   for  a  scheduled  hearing  and  missed  two  filing\n\ndeadlines.

The  psychiatrist   concluded  that\n\nplaintiff's condition was of \"at least\" a year's duration.  A\n\nnon-examining psychologist  who reviewed  plaintiff's medical\n\nrecords reported  that they  all \"fit[] a  woman with  a long\n\nstanding schizophrenic disorder possibly of the paranoid type\n\nwhose life has progressively fallen  away from her due to the\n\n                    \n\n9.    Plaintiff lost  her right  to an  immediate pension  by\nvirtue of  her termination for  \"cause\" by the DLA.   She was\napparently evicted from  her apartment in what  was described\nas a \"hostile\" scene and is unable to find employment.\n\n10.  Paranoid schizophrenia is broadly defined as a psychotic\ndisorder causing hallucinations and other major  disturbances\nin  thought,  mood,   perception,  orientation,  memory,  and\nbehavior,  and characterized  by  one  or  more  systematized\ndelusions of persecution or danger.

The  social worker reported\n\nthat  she kept \"insisting  that [the social  worker] help her\n\npetition this work release  through the court system when  it\n\nhas already been done and is a  finished case.\"  In her brief\n\non appeal here  plaintiff alleges for the first  time that in\n\nfact she was not represented by counsel after the termination\n\nof the MSPB action.  \n\n          While  not  all  the evidence  points  in  the same\n\ndirection,11 we  think it sufficient,  if proved, to  raise a\n\ngenuine  issue of  fact  as  to  whether  plaintiff's  mental\n\ncondition  rendered her  incapable of  rationally cooperating\n\nwith any counsel, and/or pursuing her claim on her own during\n\nthe limitations period.  \n\n                    \n\n11.  We  note   that  despite  his  other   conclusions,  the\nexamining  psychiatrist found that plaintiff was competent to\nhandle  her  own money.    Such  a  finding might,  in  other\ncircumstances, give us pause.  However, given the evidence of\nplaintiff's  extremely  limited financial  means,  the likely\nunavailability  of  any  guardian able  or  willing  to serve\n(plaintiff is  unmarried and receives  \"general relief\"), and\ncurrent cutbacks in delivery of state  social services, we do\nnot  find it conclusive.
