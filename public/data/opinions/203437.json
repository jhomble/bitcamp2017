Claudenir Nunes Lordes, a citizen\n\nand native of Brazil, petitions for review of an order of the Board\n\nof   Immigration    Appeals      (\"BIA\")      affirming   a   decision   of   the\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\"), rejecting his application for asylum as\n\nuntimely, and denying his claims for withholding of removal and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").                 We deny\n\nthe petition for review.\n\n                                        I.\n\n           Lordes      entered    the    United     States    through    Tecate,\n\nCalifornia on March 12, 2002, without being admitted or paroled.\n\nLater that same day, he was issued a Notice to Appear, charging him\n\nwith removability under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).              On April 30,\n\n2002, an IJ in San Diego entered an in absentia order of removal.\n\nOn May 31, 2002, Lordes filed a motion to reopen with the IJ.\n\nAlthough the motion was initially denied, the BIA remanded the case\n\nfor further proceedings after finding that ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel had caused Lordes to fail to appear at the April 30\n\nhearing   and   that    this     ineffective     assistance    constituted     an\n\n\"exceptional circumstance\" excusing his failure.\n\n           Lordes then successfully moved to change venue to Boston,\n\nMassachusetts.      On October 27, 2004, Lordes's current counsel\n\nentered her first appearance on his behalf in Boston Immigration\n\nCourt.    On July 19, 2005, Lordes filed an application for asylum\n\nand withholding of removal. This asylum application came more than\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fthree years after Lordes's entry into the United States and more\n\nthan eight months after his current counsel began representing him.\n\n            At a hearing on February 14, 2006, the IJ heard testimony\n\nfrom Lordes regarding his labor union membership and the three\n\nincidents that formed the basis of his claims for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal.       Lordes testified that he had joined the\n\nSindeferro labor union in 1988.       He stated that he participated in\n\ndemonstrations, passed out pamphlets, manned picket lines during\n\nstrikes, and invited others to join the union.\n\n            The first of the three incidents he described occurred in\n\nFebruary 2000, when two armed men broke into his home, locked\n\nLordes and his family in the bathroom, and took all of the\n\nvaluables in the home.       Lordes testified that the burglars warned\n\nthe family not to report the incident to the police and to \"stay\n\naway from the problems.\"1       He did not report this incident to the\n\npolice because of the threats the burglars had made to kill or\n\nkidnap his family.       He believed these threats because the burglars\n\n\"were    against   the   movement   that   [he]   was   working   on   in   the\n\nsyndicate.\"    After the incident, his wife and children stayed at\n\nhis father-in-law's farm for several weeks because he felt they\n\nwould be safer there.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      In his brief on appeal, Lordes asserts that \"the problems\" to\nwhich the men were referring were union activities.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f           Second, Lordes testified that he was attacked in January\n\n2001 while riding the bus to work.      The attacker stole his watch\n\nand wallet and he missed three days of work from injuries sustained\n\nin the attack.    Lordes's supervisor reported the incident to the\n\npolice, but Lordes himself did not speak with police about it.\n\nLordes stated that the attacker's characteristics were the same as\n\nthose of the burglars who had robbed his home.\n\n           Third, Lordes testified about a second home invasion in\n\nSeptember 2001.    One night while he was at work, four armed men\n\nshot and killed the family guard dog, broke into his home, tied up\n\nhis wife and children, and stole all of the valuables in the house,\n\nincluding his car.    Lordes reported this incident to the police.\n\nHe testified that he thought his family had been targeted for this\n\nattack because he was \"like a leader in the syndicate.\"           He\n\nsubmitted a translation of the police report of this incident to\n\nthe IJ.\n\n           Lordes worked at Companhia Vale Do Rio Doce (\"CVRD\") as\n\na diesel train mechanic from 1984 to 2002.          After the three\n\nincidents described above, CVRD offered to transfer Lordes to Rio\n\nde Janeiro or Sao Paolo, but he testified that he did not want to\n\nmove to another city \"[b]ecause [he] had constructed life in this\n\ncity for   more than 15 years.   And it would be very difficult to go\n\nand move to another city and start everything anew.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f            At the hearing, Lordes also testified that he did not\n\nknow about the asylum system when he arrived in the United States.\n\nHe stated that he had intended to obtain legal status through a\n\nlabor certification.2\n\n            In an oral decision, the IJ ruled that Lordes's asylum\n\napplication was untimely because it was filed more than one year\n\nafter his arrival in the United States.     The IJ did not credit\n\nLordes's testimony that he was unaware of the availability of\n\nasylum when he arrived in 2002.       The IJ also noted that the\n\nineffective assistance of counsel that justified the reopening of\n\nLordes's case did not relate to any failure to file an asylum\n\napplication or failure to advise Lordes about the availability of\n\nasylum.     Thus, the IJ found that there were no \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\" that could excuse the late filing.\n\n            The IJ also denied Lordes's claim for withholding of\n\nremoval.3   The IJ stated that Lordes had not introduced sufficient\n\n\n     2\n      On October 2, 2003, Lordes filed for a labor certification\nfrom the Department of Labor. His counsel at the time apparently\nhoped that the deadline for adjustment of status under section\n245(i) of the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act (LIFE Act) might\nbe extended. However, the April 30, 2001 deadline, established by\nthe LIFE Act Amendments of 2000, was not subsequently extended. As\na result, Lordes was never eligible for adjustment of status\nthrough the LIFE Act; the deadline had passed before he arrived in\nthe United States.\n     3\n      The IJ questioned Lordes's credibility with regard to the\nsecond home invasion because, inter alia, the police report\nindicated that Lordes had been at home during the attack, while he\ntestified that he had not been present. However, the IJ held that\neven assuming Lordes's testimony had been credible, it was\n\n                                -5-\n\fevidence to show that the attacks came about on account of his\n\nmembership in a labor union.      The IJ noted that there was no\n\nevidence regarding the extent of Lordes's involvement with a union,\n\nor that he was a member of one at all.     The IJ found it \"far more\n\nlikely that the perpetrators attacked the respondent's home because\n\nit was in a decent neighborhood where apparently people of adequate\n\nmeans lived.\"   The IJ held that Lordes could have relocated within\n\nhis own country.    The IJ also concluded that the government of\n\nBrazil was \"not a party\" to or \"complicit in\" any reported violence\n\nagainst labor union organizers.       Accordingly, the IJ \"d[id] not\n\nfind it to be more likely than not that the respondent would be\n\npersecuted if he returns to Brazil.\"\n\n           Although Lordes had not specifically requested protection\n\nunder the CAT, the IJ considered the claim sua sponte and concluded\n\nthat Lordes had not shown that \"any segment of the government of\n\nBrazil\" would harm him.   Instead, the IJ concluded that Lordes was\n\nafraid of the \"pervasive criminality\" in Brazil.        The IJ thus\n\ndenied protection under the CAT. The IJ also concluded that Lordes\n\nwas ineligible for voluntary departure because he had been served\n\nwith a Notice to Appear within one year of arriving in the United\n\nStates.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(1)(A).\n\n\ninsufficient to establish the withholding of removal claim.\nBecause of these assumptions, we do not have to consider the impact\non this case of the REAL ID Act, which altered the standard for\nevaluating   an   alien's   credibility.       See   8   U.S.C.   §\n1158(b)(1)(B)(iii).\n\n                                -6-\n\f            Lordes appealed to the BIA, which adopted and affirmed\n\nthe decision of the IJ.                 The BIA held that the ineffective\n\nassistance     of     Lordes's     prior      counsel    \"did       not   affect    the\n\nrespondent's untimely filing of his application for asylum\" and\n\nagreed with the IJ's conclusion that Lordes had \"not demonstrated\n\nhe suffered past persecution in Brazil on account of a protected\n\nground.\"    Lordes then filed this petition for review.\n\n                                          II.\n\n            Lordes asks us to reverse the determination by the IJ and\n\nthe BIA that his untimely filing of an application for asylum was\n\nnot excused by \"extraordinary circumstances.\"                    However, under 8\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1158(a)(3) and 1252(a)(2)(D), we do not have jurisdiction\n\nto   review     the     agency's     application        of    the     \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\" exception, unless the alien identifies a legal or\n\nconstitutional defect in the decision.                Hana v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d\n\n39, 43 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            Lordes identifies no such defect.                 Although he argues\n\nthat the jurisdictional bar in § 1158(a)(3) violates due process,\n\nthis argument is foreclosed by our holding in Hana, 503 F.3d at 44.\n\nHe   also     argues     that     Congress      intended      the     \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\"        exception    to    be     interpreted     broadly     and    that\n\nLordes's    \"extreme     circumstances          of   ineffective      assistance     of\n\ncounsel, coupled with ignorance of the U.S. asylum law\" constitute\n\nsuch circumstances.         However, this argument does not raise any\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fconstitutional or legal claims.    Instead, it asks us to second-\n\nguess the agency's assessment of the merits of the \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\" claim.   This is precisely what we cannot do under §\n\n1158(a)(3). Accordingly, we are without jurisdiction to review the\n\nrejection of Lordes's asylum application on timeliness grounds.\n\n                                III.\n\n            Lordes also challenges the denials of withholding of\n\nremoval and protection under the CAT.     Where, as here, the BIA\n\nadopts and affirms the IJ's ruling, and also discusses some of the\n\nbases for the IJ's opinion, we review both the IJ's and the BIA's\n\nopinions.   Zheng v. Gonzales, 475 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2007).    We\n\nafford a high degree of deference to factual findings in those\n\nopinions and must allow them to stand \"unless 'any reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.'\"\n\nRodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)).\n\nA.   Withholding of Removal\n\n            An alien seeking withholding of removal, pursuant to 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A), must demonstrate that \"his or her life or\n\nfreedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on\n\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.\"   8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b).     The\n\nalien may meet this burden by showing either past persecution,\n\nwhich creates a rebuttable presumption of future persecution, or\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fthat \"it is more likely than not\" that he would suffer future\n\npersecution if he returned.         Id.; Hana, 503 F.3d at 42 n.2.\n\n           Lordes contends that his testimony that the three attacks\n\nhe   experienced    in    Brazil    were   motivated   by   his   labor   union\n\nmembership   was    unrefuted      and   therefore   conclusive.      However,\n\n\"[w]here the record supports plausible but conflicting inferences,\"\n\nthe IJ is free to choose between those inferences.                 Hincapie v.\n\nGonzales, 494 F.3d 213, 219 (1st Cir. 2007).           In this case, the IJ\n\ndid just that, concluding that, based on Lordes's description, the\n\nattacks had likely been motivated by \"basic criminality and the\n\nintent of evil doers to rob the respondent and his family of their\n\npossessions.\"      The BIA agreed with the characterization of Lordes\n\nas a \"victim of random violence.\"              Even on the assumption that\n\nLordes's testimony was entirely credible, his conclusory statements\n\nlinking the three attacks to his union membership do not compel the\n\nconclusion that he was targeted \"on account of\" that membership.\n\nSee Samayoa Cabrera v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(\"While an alien seeking asylum is not required to provide direct\n\nproof of his persecutors' motives, he must provide some evidence of\n\nsuch motives.\").         Accordingly, we affirm the determination that\n\nLordes did not demonstrate past persecution.\n\n           If no past persecution has been shown, the alien bears\n\nthe burden of demonstrating that it is more likely than not that he\n\nor she would experience persecution in the future if he or she\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\freturned and that \"it would not be reasonable for him or her to\n\nrelocate\" within the home country to avoid threats of future\n\npersecution. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2),(b)(3)(i). The IJ concluded\n\nthat Lordes had not met that burden and the BIA agreed, stating\n\nthat Lordes had \"failed to demonstrate . . . that                          he would\n\nexperience problems throughout the country of Brazil.\" Lordes does\n\nnot address this issue in his appellate briefs.                 Accordingly, he\n\nhas abandoned the issue. Berrio-Barrera v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 163,\n\n168 & n.2 (1st Cir. 2006).          In any event, the record supports the\n\nconclusion that internal relocation would be feasible.                     Thus, his\n\nwithholding of removal claim fails.\n\nB. CAT Protection\n\n            To   be    eligible     for    CAT    protection,   an     alien      must\n\ndemonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be\n\ntortured   in    his   home   country      by    the   government    or    with   its\n\nacquiescence.          8   C.F.R.     §§     1208.16(c)(4),         1208.18(a)(1).\n\n\"Acquiescence\" requires that a \"public official, prior to the\n\nactivity constituting torture, have awareness of such activity and\n\nthereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to\n\nprevent such activity.\"           8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(7).               Lordes has\n\nfailed to establish that any segment of the Brazilian government\n\nwould torture him or acquiesce in his torture if he returned to\n\nBrazil.    Thus, he is ineligible for CAT protection.\n\n            Petition denied.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f",

On July 19, 2005, Lordes filed an application for asylum\n\nand withholding of removal. This asylum application came more than\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fthree years after Lordes's entry into the United States and more\n\nthan eight months after his current counsel began representing him.\n\n            At a hearing on February 14, 2006, the IJ heard testimony\n\nfrom Lordes regarding his labor union membership and the three\n\nincidents that formed the basis of his claims for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal.       Lordes testified that he had joined the\n\nSindeferro labor union in 1988.

He believed these threats because the burglars\n\n\"were    against   the   movement   that   [he]   was   working   on   in   the\n\nsyndicate.\"    After the incident, his wife and children stayed at\n\nhis father-in-law's farm for several weeks because he felt they\n\nwould be safer there.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      In his brief on appeal, Lordes asserts that \"the problems\" to\nwhich the men were referring were union activities.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f           Second, Lordes testified that he was attacked in January\n\n2001 while riding the bus to work.      The attacker stole his watch\n\nand wallet and he missed three days of work from injuries sustained\n\nin the attack.    Lordes's supervisor reported the incident to the\n\npolice, but Lordes himself did not speak with police about it.\n\nLordes stated that the attacker's characteristics were the same as\n\nthose of the burglars who had robbed his home.\n\n           Third, Lordes testified about a second home invasion in\n\nSeptember 2001.    One night while he was at work, four armed men\n\nshot and killed the family guard dog, broke into his home, tied up\n\nhis wife and children, and stole all of the valuables in the house,\n\nincluding his car.    Lordes reported this incident to the police.\n\nHe testified that he thought his family had been targeted for this\n\nattack because he was \"like a leader in the syndicate.\"           He\n\nsubmitted a translation of the police report of this incident to\n\nthe IJ.\n\n           Lordes worked at Companhia Vale Do Rio Doce (\"CVRD\") as\n\na diesel train mechanic from 1984 to 2002.          After the three\n\nincidents described above, CVRD offered to transfer Lordes to Rio\n\nde Janeiro or Sao Paolo, but he testified that he did not want to\n\nmove to another city \"[b]ecause [he] had constructed life in this\n\ncity for   more than 15 years.   And it would be very difficult to go\n\nand move to another city and start everything anew.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f            At the hearing, Lordes also testified that he did not\n\nknow about the asylum system when he arrived in the United States.\n\nHe stated that he had intended to obtain legal status through a\n\nlabor certification.2\n\n            In an oral decision, the IJ ruled that Lordes's asylum\n\napplication was untimely because it was filed more than one year\n\nafter his arrival in the United States.     The IJ did not credit\n\nLordes's testimony that he was unaware of the availability of\n\nasylum when he arrived in 2002.       The IJ also noted that the\n\nineffective assistance of counsel that justified the reopening of\n\nLordes's case did not relate to any failure to file an asylum\n\napplication or failure to advise Lordes about the availability of\n\nasylum.     Thus, the IJ found that there were no \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\" that could excuse the late filing.\n\n            The IJ also denied Lordes's claim for withholding of\n\nremoval.3   The IJ stated that Lordes had not introduced sufficient\n\n\n     2\n      On October 2, 2003, Lordes filed for a labor certification\nfrom the Department of Labor. His counsel at the time apparently\nhoped that the deadline for adjustment of status under section\n245(i) of the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act (LIFE Act) might\nbe extended. However, the April 30, 2001 deadline, established by\nthe LIFE Act Amendments of 2000, was not subsequently extended. As\na result, Lordes was never eligible for adjustment of status\nthrough the LIFE Act; the deadline had passed before he arrived in\nthe United States.\n     3\n      The IJ questioned Lordes's credibility with regard to the\nsecond home invasion because, inter alia, the police report\nindicated that Lordes had been at home during the attack, while he\ntestified that he had not been present. However, the IJ held that\neven assuming Lordes's testimony had been credible, it was\n\n                                -5-\n\fevidence to show that the attacks came about on account of his\n\nmembership in a labor union.      The IJ noted that there was no\n\nevidence regarding the extent of Lordes's involvement with a union,\n\nor that he was a member of one at all.     The IJ found it \"far more\n\nlikely that the perpetrators attacked the respondent's home because\n\nit was in a decent neighborhood where apparently people of adequate\n\nmeans lived.\"   The IJ held that Lordes could have relocated within\n\nhis own country.    The IJ also concluded that the government of\n\nBrazil was \"not a party\" to or \"complicit in\" any reported violence\n\nagainst labor union organizers.       Accordingly, the IJ \"d[id] not\n\nfind it to be more likely than not that the respondent would be\n\npersecuted if he returns to Brazil.\"\n\n           Although Lordes had not specifically requested protection\n\nunder the CAT, the IJ considered the claim sua sponte and concluded\n\nthat Lordes had not shown that \"any segment of the government of\n\nBrazil\" would harm him.   Instead, the IJ concluded that Lordes was\n\nafraid of the \"pervasive criminality\" in Brazil.        The IJ thus\n\ndenied protection under the CAT. The IJ also concluded that Lordes\n\nwas ineligible for voluntary departure because he had been served\n\nwith a Notice to Appear within one year of arriving in the United\n\nStates.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(1)(A).\n\n\ninsufficient to establish the withholding of removal claim.\nBecause of these assumptions, we do not have to consider the impact\non this case of the REAL ID Act, which altered the standard for\nevaluating   an   alien's   credibility.       See   8   U.S.C.   §\n1158(b)(1)(B)(iii).\n\n                                -6-\n\f            Lordes appealed to the BIA, which adopted and affirmed\n\nthe decision of the IJ.                 The BIA held that the ineffective\n\nassistance     of     Lordes's     prior      counsel    \"did       not   affect    the\n\nrespondent's untimely filing of his application for asylum\" and\n\nagreed with the IJ's conclusion that Lordes had \"not demonstrated\n\nhe suffered past persecution in Brazil on account of a protected\n\nground.\"    Lordes then filed this petition for review.\n\n                                          II.\n\n            Lordes asks us to reverse the determination by the IJ and\n\nthe BIA that his untimely filing of an application for asylum was\n\nnot excused by \"extraordinary circumstances.\"                    However, under 8\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1158(a)(3) and 1252(a)(2)(D), we do not have jurisdiction\n\nto   review     the     agency's     application        of    the     \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\" exception, unless the alien identifies a legal or\n\nconstitutional defect in the decision.                Hana v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202941\"><a href=\"/opinion/202941/hana-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 43 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            Lordes identifies no such defect.                 Although he argues\n\nthat the jurisdictional bar in § 1158(a)(3) violates due process,\n\nthis argument is foreclosed by our holding in Hana, 503 F.3d at 44.\n\nHe   also     argues     that     Congress      intended      the     \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\"        exception    to    be     interpreted     broadly     and    that\n\nLordes's    \"extreme     circumstances          of   ineffective      assistance     of\n\ncounsel, coupled with ignorance of the U.S. asylum law\" constitute\n\nsuch circumstances.         However, this argument does not raise any\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fconstitutional or legal claims.    Instead, it asks us to second-\n\nguess the agency's assessment of the merits of the \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\" claim.   This is precisely what we cannot do under §\n\n1158(a)(3). Accordingly, we are without jurisdiction to review the\n\nrejection of Lordes's asylum application on timeliness grounds.\n\n                                III.\n\n            Lordes also challenges the denials of withholding of\n\nremoval and protection under the CAT.     Where, as here, the BIA\n\nadopts and affirms the IJ's ruling, and also discusses some of the\n\nbases for the IJ's opinion, we review both the IJ's and the BIA's\n\nopinions.   Zheng v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202616\"><a href=\"/opinion/202616/zheng-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33 (1st Cir. 2007).    We\n\nafford a high degree of deference to factual findings in those\n\nopinions and must allow them to stand \"unless 'any reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.'\"\n\nRodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201454\"><a href=\"/opinion/201454/rodriguez-ramirez-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)).\n\nA.   Withholding of Removal\n\n            An alien seeking withholding of removal, pursuant to 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A), must demonstrate that \"his or her life or\n\nfreedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on\n\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.\"   8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b).     The\n\nalien may meet this burden by showing either past persecution,\n\nwhich creates a rebuttable presumption of future persecution, or\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fthat \"it is more likely than not\" that he would suffer future\n\npersecution if he returned.         Id.; Hana, 503 F.3d at 42 n.2.\n\n           Lordes contends that his testimony that the three attacks\n\nhe   experienced    in    Brazil    were   motivated   by   his   labor   union\n\nmembership   was    unrefuted      and   therefore   conclusive.      However,\n\n\"[w]here the record supports plausible but conflicting inferences,\"\n\nthe IJ is free to choose between those inferences.                 Hincapie v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202847\"><a href=\"/opinion/202847/lopez-de-hincapie-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 219 (1st Cir. 2007).           In this case, the IJ\n\ndid just that, concluding that, based on Lordes's description, the\n\nattacks had likely been motivated by \"basic criminality and the\n\nintent of evil doers to rob the respondent and his family of their\n\npossessions.\"      The BIA agreed with the characterization of Lordes\n\nas a \"victim of random violence.\"              Even on the assumption that\n\nLordes's testimony was entirely credible, his conclusory statements\n\nlinking the three attacks to his union membership do not compel the\n\nconclusion that he was targeted \"on account of\" that membership.\n\nSee Samayoa Cabrera v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200986\"><a href=\"/opinion/200986/samayoa-cabrera-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(\"While an alien seeking asylum is not required to provide direct\n\nproof of his persecutors' motives, he must provide some evidence of\n\nsuch motives.\").         Accordingly, we affirm the determination that\n\nLordes did not demonstrate past persecution.\n\n           If no past persecution has been shown, the alien bears\n\nthe burden of demonstrating that it is more likely than not that he\n\nor she would experience persecution in the future if he or she\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\freturned and that \"it would not be reasonable for him or her to\n\nrelocate\" within the home country to avoid threats of future\n\npersecution. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2),(b)(3)(i). The IJ concluded\n\nthat Lordes had not met that burden and the BIA agreed, stating\n\nthat Lordes had \"failed to demonstrate . . . that                          he would\n\nexperience problems throughout the country of Brazil.\" Lordes does\n\nnot address this issue in his appellate briefs.                 Accordingly, he\n\nhas abandoned the issue. Berrio-Barrera v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202382\"><a href=\"/opinion/202382/berrio-barrera-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n168 & n.2 (1st Cir. 2006).          In any event, the record supports the\n\nconclusion that internal relocation would be feasible.                     Thus, his\n\nwithholding of removal claim fails.\n\nB. CAT Protection\n\n            To   be    eligible     for    CAT    protection,   an     alien      must\n\ndemonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be\n\ntortured   in    his   home   country      by    the   government    or    with   its\n\nacquiescence.          8   C.F.R.     §§     1208.16(c)(4),         1208.18(a)(1).\n\n\"Acquiescence\" requires that a \"public official, prior to the\n\nactivity constituting torture, have awareness of such activity and\n\nthereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to\n\nprevent such activity.\"           8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(7).               Lordes has\n\nfailed to establish that any segment of the Brazilian government\n\nwould torture him or acquiesce in his torture if he returned to\n\nBrazil.    Thus, he is ineligible for CAT protection.\n\n            Petition denied.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f</pre>",
