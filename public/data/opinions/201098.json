Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                    Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     John P. Griffith, with whom Griffith & Associates, PLLC was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Chris Scott Graham, with whom Grace E. Jo and Dechert LLP were\non brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           July 7, 2004\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.      This is a case of a suitor\n\nscorned.   Plaintiff-appellant Alternative System Concepts, Inc.\n\n(ASC) courted Language for Design Automation, Inc. (LEDA) and\n\nforged a short-term distribution relationship. As the couple moved\n\ntoward a more durable bond, defendant-appellee Synopsys, Inc.\n\nacquired LEDA and dashed ASC's hopes.\n\n           The jilted suitor responded aggressively, haling Synopsys\n\ninto court and claiming, inter alia, misrepresentation and breach\n\nof promise. The district court dismissed the former claim early in\n\nthe proceedings and subsequently granted summary judgment for\n\nSynopsys on the latter.   ASC appeals.   After addressing a number of\n\nissues (including an issue of first impression in this circuit\n\nconcerning judicial estoppel), we affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmoving party (here, ASC) and draw all reasonable inferences in\n\nthat party's favor.    Because there are differences between the\n\nground rules that apply to motions to dismiss as opposed to motions\n\nfor summary judgment, compare Chongris v. Bd. of Appeals, 811 F.2d\n\n36, 37 (1st Cir. 1987) (explaining that the factual averments\n\ncontained in the plaintiff's complaint supply the template for\n\nreview of a decision granting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss),\n\nwith Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(explaining that the evidence of record supplies the template for\n\n\n                                -2-\n\freview   of    a     decision   granting   a   Rule   56   motion   for   summary\n\njudgment),      we    adjust    for   those    differences    in    our   ensuing\n\ndiscussion of the district court's rulings.\n\n              ASC is a New Hampshire corporation involved in the design\n\nand marketing of programs used in the production of computer chips.\n\nOn March 29, 1999, it entered into a letter of understanding (the\n\nLOU) with LEDA, a French software designer.                  In the LOU, LEDA\n\nappointed ASC as the exclusive distributor of its Proton product\n\nline in the United States for a six-month term commencing April 1,\n\n1999.    The parties further declared that they would attempt to\n\n\"negotiate in good faith a permanent agreement based on experiences\n\nduring the term of th[e] LOU.\"                 That declaration was purely\n\naspirational; the LOU stated expressly that neither party had any\n\nobligation to enter such a permanent agreement.\n\n              During the next six months, the two firms engaged in\n\nsporadic negotiations. On September 1, 1999, their representatives\n\nmet in France in hopes of hammering out the details of a permanent\n\narrangement.         Although LEDA's managing director assured ASC that\n\n\"all was satisfactory with regard to a permanent agreement,\" the\n\nparties neither developed nor signed a written contract.                    Later\n\nthat month, the parties exchanged e-mails that apparently extended\n\nthe geographic coverage of the LOU to Canada.\n\n              Talks continued past the LOU's expiration date (September\n\n30, 1999).     On October 5, representatives of the two companies met\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fin Florida.    LEDA agreed to extend the LOU for a reasonable time\n\npending the    completion    of    negotiations.      It   also   notified   a\n\nprospective customer that ASC remained the exclusive distributor of\n\nLEDA products in the United States and Canada.         ASC claims that the\n\nparties had by then substantially agreed on the key terms of a\n\npermanent distribution relationship, but the fact remains that LEDA\n\nbalked at signing such an agreement.\n\n          In   January      of    2000,    Synopsys   (a   California-based\n\ncompetitor of ASC) acquired LEDA.             It promptly terminated the\n\ninterim distribution agreement and broke off the negotiations for\n\na permanent relationship.         ASC was left out in the cold.\n\n          ASC lost little time in bringing this diversity action\n\nagainst Synopsys in New Hampshire's federal district court. See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1332(a).    Its first amended complaint charged that LEDA\n\nhad been derelict in its duty to negotiate a permanent distribution\n\nagreement in good faith; that LEDA had intentionally misrepresented\n\nthe nature of its interactions with Synopsys; that LEDA had flouted\n\nan implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and that\n\nSynopsys bore responsibility for these transgressions as LEDA's\n\nsuccessor in interest.           Finally, the first amended complaint\n\ncharged Synopsys, in its own right, with having interfered with\n\nASC's advantageous contractual relations.\n\n          Synopsys moved to jettison the complaint for failure to\n\nstate claims upon which relief could be granted.           See Fed. R. Civ.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fP. 12(b)(6).   On August 2, 2001, the district court dismissed the\n\nmisrepresentation claim on the ground that ASC had not pleaded\n\nmisrepresentation    with    the   requisite   particularity.      ASC   v.\n\nSynopsys, Inc., No. 00-546, 2001 WL 920029, at *2 (D.N.H. Aug. 2,\n\n2001) (ASC I).      Nevertheless, the court refused to dismiss the\n\nbreach of contract claim.      See id.    A period of protracted pretrial\n\ndiscovery commenced.     Eighteen months later, the district court\n\ngranted Synopsys's motion for summary judgment on the breach of\n\ncontract count.1     ASC v. Synopsys, Inc., No. 00-546, 2003 WL\n\n358737, at *3 (D.N.H. Feb. 19, 2003) (ASC II).        That ended the suit\n\nand precipitated this appeal.\n\n          In order to put the arguments on appeal into workable\n\nperspective, we pause to provide additional detail anent the lower\n\ncourt's treatment of ASC's breach of contract claim.            Count I of\n\nthe first amended complaint alleged that \"Synopsys/LEDA breached\n\nits agreement to negotiate a permanent agreement in good faith and\n\nto honor the Canadian distributorship.\"         In support of its motion\n\nto dismiss, Synopsys argued in relevant part that, to the extent\n\nthis claim was premised on an oral contract entered into between\n\nthe parties following the execution of the LOU, it was barred by\n\nthe statute of frauds.      See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 506:2 (providing\n\n\n\n     1\n      In other pretrial rulings, the district court dismissed ASC's\nimplied covenant claim and granted summary judgment for Synopsys on\nASC's interference claim.    ASC has not appealed from either of\nthese decisions, so we need not probe them more deeply.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthat \"[n]o action shall be brought . . . upon any agreement . . .\n\nthat is not to be performed within one year from the time of making\n\nit, unless such . . . agreement . . . is in writing\").            In its\n\nopposition,    ASC    clarified   that   it   was   \"not   claiming   that\n\n[LEDA/Synopsys] breached an agreement to enter into a long term\n\ncontract.\"    Rather, its breach of contract claim was \"that LEDA\n\nbreached its agreement to negotiate in good faith\" as required by\n\nthe LOU.\n\n            The district court took ASC at its word. Noting that ASC\n\nhad explicitly abandoned any claim that the parties had entered a\n\nsubsequent oral agreement, the court treated ASC's cause of action\n\nas one \"that LEDA breached its contractual obligation to make a\n\ngood faith effort to negotiate a permanent marketing agreement that\n\ninitially covered the United States and later was amended to\n\ninclude Canada.\"      ASC I, 2001 WL 920029, at *2 n.2.        Since the\n\ncourt tentatively deemed the statute of frauds impuissant to defeat\n\nthis cause of action, it denied the motion to dismiss the breach of\n\ncontract count.      Id. at *2.\n\n            By the time that discovery had run its course and the\n\nparties had gotten around to filing cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment, ASC had experienced an epiphany. In its summary judgment\n\npapers, it alleged that on October 5, 1999, the parties entered\n\ninto an oral distribution agreement covering the United States and\n\nCanada.    It also averred that LEDA/Synopsys subsequently breached\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fthis permanent arrangement. Synopsys vociferously objected to this\n\nchanged tune.    It maintained that this approach evinced a new and\n\ninconsistent theory; that, throughout the litigation, ASC had\n\nconstrued its breach of contract claim as a claim for breach of a\n\nduty to negotiate in good faith; and that this tergiversation\n\nresulted in a theory that fell outside the purview of the first\n\namended complaint.\n\n           The district court agreed with Synopsys's assessment. It\n\ninvoked the doctrine of judicial estoppel, pointing out that ASC\n\nhad   obtained   an    \"advantage    by    contending     in   opposition    to\n\nSynopsys's motion to dismiss that its breach of contract claim was\n\npremised on an alleged breach of the LOU, rather than a subsequent\n\noral agreement to make the LOU permanent.\"         ASC II, 2003 WL 358737,\n\nat *3.    Accordingly, the court held that ASC was barred from\n\nadvancing a contradictory position on summary judgment.              Id.    The\n\ncourt thereupon granted brevis dispositon in favor of Synopsys.\n\n          On appeal, ASC contends that the lower court erred in (i)\n\ndismissing its misrepresentation claim, (ii) refusing to allow a\n\nfurther   amended     complaint   designed    to   cure    defects   in     the\n\nmisrepresentation     count,   and   (iii)    invoking     the   doctrine    of\n\njudicial estoppel to bar the breach of contract claim that it\n\nwished to propound on summary judgment.2        Synopsys, by motion, asks\n\n\n      2\n      ASC also makes a perfunctory attempt to assert a theory of\npromissory estoppel. This theory was not presented to the district\ncourt in the summary judgment proceedings. Accordingly, we deem\n\n                                     -7-\n\fus to (i) dismiss the appeal, and (ii) award sanctions against ASC.\n\nWe address these points below, starting with Synopsys's motion to\n\ndismiss, then confronting ASC's asseverational array, and ending\n\nwith a consideration of the request for sanctions.\n\nII.   THE MOTION TO DISMISS THE APPEAL\n\n            While this case was pending in the district court,\n\nSynopsys filed a California state court action accusing ASC of\n\nconspiracy and unfair business practices.           On April 1, 2003 —\n\nshortly after the institution of this appeal — the parties reached\n\nat least a tentative settlement in the California action. There is\n\nsome indication that the terms of the settlement contemplated the\n\ndismissal of the earlier (New Hampshire) action.           After Synopsys\n\nencountered resistance from ASC with respect to implementing the\n\nsupposed    settlement,   it   asked   the   California   court   to   enter\n\njudgment pursuant to the settlement agreement.        The court obliged,\n\nalbeit without discussion, entering judgment ex parte on September\n\n11, 2003.\n\n            Citing these facts, Synopsys invites us to dismiss this\n\nappeal as moot and/or barred by the doctrine of res judicata.3           ASC\n\n\n\nthe argument unpreserved. See Teamsters Union v. Superline Transp.\nCo., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992); Clauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d\n660, 666 (1st Cir. 1987).\n      3\n      Synopsys premises both mootness and res judicata on the same\nseries of events.    Since Synopsys directs virtually all of its\nlegal argumentation to res judicata, we use that label to embrace\nboth concepts.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fcounters by asserting that the settlement was never consummated.\n\nIt also contends that the California judgment was entered without\n\nproper notice (and is, therefore, void).\n\n            We decline Synopsys's invitation to short-circuit this\n\nappeal.   The record and briefing before us are too skimpy to allow\n\na definitive determination as to either the status or scope of the\n\nostensible settlement.    By like token, the record is inadequate to\n\npermit us to assess the res judicata effect of the California\n\njudgment.   Given the need for more information, we deem it prudent\n\nto sidestep the late-emerging res judicata issue and proceed\n\ndirectly to the merits.     See, e.g., Henry v. Connolly, 910 F.2d\n\n1000, 1004 (1st Cir. 1990) (deciding appeal on merits, favorably to\n\nappellees, without deciding whether action was barred by res\n\njudicata or lack of standing); see also Penobscot Nation v. Ga.-\n\nPac. Corp., 254 F.3d 317, 324 (1st Cir. 2001) (discussing limits of\n\nSupreme Court plurality decision in Steel Co. v. Citizens for a\n\nBetter Env't, 523 U.S. 83 (1998)).     Any other course would be an\n\nexercise in batrachomyomachia.\n\nIII.   THE MISREPRESENTATION CLAIM\n\n            ASC assigns error to both the district court's dismissal\n\nof its misrepresentation claim and to the court's subsequent\n\n\"failure\" to allow a curative amendment.   These remonstrances need\n\nnot occupy us for long.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f                      A.       Applicable Legal Standards.\n\n              We review de novo a trial court's allowance of a Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. LaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co.,\n\n142 F.3d 507, 509 (1st Cir. 1998).                  In that process, we take as\n\ntrue the factual averments contained in the complaint, but \"eschew\n\nany reliance on bald assertions, unsupportable conclusions, and\n\nopprobrious epithets.\"               Chongris, 811 F.2d at 37 (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).                From this plaintiff-friendly\n\ncoign of vantage, we may affirm an order for dismissal only if no\n\nwell-pleaded set of facts supports recovery. Conley v. Gibson, 355\n\nU.S. 41, 45-46 (1957); LaChapelle, 142 F.3d at 508.\n\n              Federal civil practice is based on notice pleading.\n\nThus, \"[g]reat specificity is ordinarily not required to survive a\n\nRule 12(b)(6) motion.\"               Garita Hotel Ltd. P'ship v. Ponce Fed.\n\nBank,   958    F.2d     15,     17    (1st   Cir.    1992);     accord   Educadores\n\nPuertorriqueños en Acción v. Rey Hernández, 367 F.3d 61, 66 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (disclaiming heightened pleading standards except where\n\na statute or Civil Rule specifically imposes one).                    Cases alleging\n\nfraud — and for this purpose, misrepresentation is considered a\n\nspecies   of    fraud      —    constitute   an     exception    to    this   general\n\nproposition.      The Civil Rules explicitly require that \"[i]n all\n\naverments of fraud . . . the circumstances constituting fraud . .\n\n. shall be stated with particularity.\"                Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).        In\n\nsuch cases, the pleader usually is expected to specify the who,\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fwhat,     where,    and   when   of   the   allegedly   false   or     fraudulent\n\nrepresentation.4      Powers v. Boston Cooper Corp., 926 F.2d 109, 111\n\n(1st Cir. 1991); McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., 633 F.2d\n\n226, 228 (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n                            B.   The Original Claim.\n\n             ASC's first amended complaint alleged in substance that\n\nLEDA failed to disclose that merger talks were ongoing between it\n\nand     Synopsys,    but,    rather,    downplayed      the   discussions     and\n\ncharacterized the contemplated relationship as merely a \"technical\n\npartnership\" that would not affect the outcome of the ASC-LEDA\n\nnegotiations.        ASC    further    alleged   that   it    relied    on   these\n\nknowingly false representations to its detriment.5                   Despite the\n\nfervor with which ASC denounced this treachery, it did not provide\n\nany details as to who allegedly uttered the misleading statements,\n\nto whom they were made, where they were made, when they occurred,\n\nand what actions they engendered.             See ASC I, 2001 WL 920029, at\n\n\n\n      4\n      We say \"usually\" because there may be occasional exceptions,\nowing to extraordinary circumstances.       See, e.g., Corley v.\nRosewood Care Ctr., Inc., 142 F.3d 1041, 1050-51 (7th Cir. 1998).\nNo such circumstances are extant here.\n      5\n      Under New Hampshire law, the elements of a fraudulent\nmisrepresentation claim are: \"(1) the defendant misrepresented a\nmaterial fact to the plaintiff, knowing it to be false; (2) the\ndefendant did so with fraudulent intent that the plaintiff act on\nit; and (3) that the plaintiff, without knowledge of its falsity,\ndetrimentally relied on the misrepresentation.\"     Alexander v.\nFujitsu Bus. Communic. Sys., Inc., 818 F. Supp. 462, 467 (D.N.H.\n1993) (citing Proctor v. Bank of N.H., 464 A.2d 263, 265 (N.H.\n1983)).\n\n                                       -11-\n\f*2.   In short, ASC's misrepresentation claim was wholly conclusory\n\nand lacking any semblance of specific detail. Given the strictures\n\nof Rule 9(b), the district court's dismissal of that barebones\n\nclaim was entirely proper.            See, e.g., Powers, 926 F.2d at 111;\n\nLopez v. Bulova Watch Co., 582 F. Supp. 755, 766 (D.R.I. 1984).\n\n                          C.   The Curative Amendment.\n\n              ASC's fallback position is as insubstantial as a house\n\nbuilt upon the shifting sands.           It notes that, after the district\n\ncourt   had    dismissed       the   misrepresentation    claim     for   want    of\n\nspecificity, it moved for leave to refile, in a further amended\n\ncomplaint,     a   more   particularized       version   of   the   claim.       The\n\ndistrict court denied this request on February 14, 2003, and ASC\n\nnow calumnizes that order.\n\n              This challenge is based on a half-truth.              Although ASC\n\ndid seek leave to file a curative amendment, it unilaterally\n\nwithdrew that motion before the court reached the matter.                 A party\n\nwho voluntarily withdraws a motion prior to judicial consideration\n\ncannot later claim that the court's pro forma denial of the\n\nwithdrawn motion constitutes reversible error.                See Baty v. United\n\nStates, 275 F.2d 310, 311 (9th Cir. 1960) (per curiam); cf. United\n\nStates v. Tierney, 760 F.2d 382, 388 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"Having one's\n\ncake and eating it, too, is not in fashion in this circuit.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fIV.   THE BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM\n\n           The district court, invoking the doctrine of judicial\n\nestoppel, consigned ASC's breach of contract claim to the scrap\n\nheap.   ASC II, 2003 WL 358737, at *3.        ASC assigns error and seeks\n\nreversal of the summary judgment entered in favor of Synopsys on\n\nthat claim.   We examine the particulars of this contretemps below.\n\n                   A.   Applicable Legal Standards.\n\n           We review the district court's disposition of a motion\n\nfor summary judgment de novo, scrutinizing the facts in the light\n\nmost favorable to the nonmoving party.          See Garside, 895 F.2d at\n\n48. We will affirm only if the \"pleadings, depositions, answers to\n\ninterrogatories,    and   admissions     on   file,   together   with   the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law.\"      Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n           This court has not yet had occasion to determine the\n\nappropriate standard for reviewing a trial court's application of\n\nthe doctrine of judicial estoppel.        See Gens v. Resolution Trust\n\nCorp., 112 F.3d 569, 572 n.2 (1st Cir. 1997) (reserving the\n\nquestion); Desjardins v. Van Buren Cmty. Hosp., 37 F.3d 21, 23 (1st\n\nCir. 1994) (same).      This case requires us to fill that void.        We\n\nhold that the applicable rubric is abuse of discretion.          We ground\n\nthis holding on four lines of reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f              First, the Supreme Court has explained that \"judicial\n\nestoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its\n\ndiscretion.\"      New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 750 (2001)\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).                   On that basis,\n\nthe abuse of discretion standard seems a natural fit.                  Cf. Pierce\n\nv.   Underwood,    487   U.S.   552,    558    (1988)    (noting    that    matters\n\nconsigned to a trial court's discretion are generally reviewed for\n\nabuse   of    discretion).      Second,        deferential    review    often    is\n\nappropriate     for   matters   in     which    the   trial   court    is   \"better\n\npositioned . . . to decide the issue in question.\"                      Miller v.\n\nFenton, 474 U.S. 104, 114 (1985).               Judicial estoppel is such a\n\nmatter.      Determining whether a litigant is playing fast and loose\n\nwith the courts has a subjective element.                 Its resolution draws\n\nupon the trier's intimate knowledge of the case at bar and his or\n\nher first-hand observations of the lawyers and their litigation\n\nstrategies. Third, abuse of discretion is a flexible standard, and\n\nthe amorphous nature of judicial estoppel, cf. Desjardins, 37 F.3d\n\nat 23 (observing that \"judicial estoppel is not extrinsically a\n\nmatter of fact or law; the issues that arise may turn out to be\n\nones of raw fact, abstract law, or something in between\"), places\n\na high premium on such flexibility.            See Underwood, 487 U.S. at 562\n\n(suggesting     discretionary     review       for    \"multifarious    and    novel\n\nquestion[s], little susceptible . . . of useful generalization\").\n\nLast — but far from least — the other courts of appeals to have\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\faddressed this question have settled unanimously on abuse of\n\ndiscretion review.    See, e.g., Coastal Plains, Inc. v. Mims (In re\n\nCoastal Plains, Inc.), 179 F.3d 197, 205 (5th Cir. 1999); Talavera\n\nv. Sch. Bd., 129 F.3d 1214, 1216 (11th Cir. 1997); McNemar v.\n\nDisney Store, Inc., 91 F.3d 610, 616-17 (3d Cir. 1996); Data Gen.\n\nCorp. v. Johnson, 78 F.3d 1556, 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1996); United\n\nStates v. Garcia, 37 F.3d 1359, 1367 (9th Cir. 1994).    A court of\n\nappeals should always be reluctant to create a circuit split\n\nwithout a compelling reason, and none exists here.\n\n          The fact that this case arises in the summary judgment\n\ncontext does not affect our decision to review the trial court's\n\ndetermination for abuse of discretion.    Although there may seem at\n\nfirst blush to be some tension between the plenary review afforded\n\nto a summary judgment ruling and the deferential review of a\n\nthreshold judicial estoppel determination, that tension is more\n\napparent than real.    Most evidentiary determinations are reviewed\n\nfor abuse of discretion, see, e.g., Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of\n\nN. Am., 100 F.3d 203, 212-13 (1st Cir. 1996); Blinzler v. Marriott\n\nInt'l, Inc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1158 (1st Cir. 1996), and the same\n\nstandard of review typically applies to threshold evidentiary\n\ndeterminations made in connection with summary judgment motions,\n\nsee, e.g., Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 142-43 (1997)\n\n(holding that an appellate court should review a trial court's\n\ndecision to admit or exclude expert testimony at summary judgment\n\n\n                                -15-\n\ffor abuse of discretion); Schubert v. Nissan Motor Corp., 148 F.3d\n\n25,   29   (1st   Cir.   1998)    (holding     that   if   the   district   court\n\ndetermines the admissibility of evidence for purposes of a summary\n\njudgment    proceeding,     the   court   of    appeals    must   \"review    that\n\ndecision for abuse of discretion prior to turning to [its] de novo\n\nsummary judgment examination\"); EEOC v. Green, 76 F.3d 19, 24 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (discussing the district court's \"broad authority to\n\nprescribe the evidentiary materials it will consider in deciding a\n\nmotion for summary judgment\" and conducting appellate review for\n\nabuse of discretion).        Evidentiary rulings have the potential to\n\nshape and winnow the scope of the summary judgment inquiry, and a\n\ntrial court should have as much leeway in dealing with those\n\nmatters at the summary judgment stage as at trial.               As other courts\n\nhave recognized, judicial estoppel fits neatly into this taxonomy.\n\nSee, e.g., Ahrens v. Perot Sys. Corp., 205 F.3d 831, 833 (5th Cir.\n\n2000); Johnson v. Oregon, 141 F.3d 1361, 1364 (9th Cir. 1998);\n\nTalavera, 129 F.3d at 1216.         We adopt that standard.\n\n            The abuse of discretion standard is familiar.               We will\n\nnot overturn a nisi prius court's discretionary decision unless it\n\nplainly appears that the court committed a clear error of judgment\n\nin the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the proper factors.\n\nIn re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 859 F.2d 1007, 1019\n\n(1st Cir. 1988); In re Josephson, 218 F.2d 174, 182 (1st Cir. 1954)\n\n(Magruder, C.J.).        This standard is deferential and requires that\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fa   reviewing    court   remain    mindful    of   its   obligation   \"not   to\n\nsubstitute its judgment for that of the [district court].\"              Motor\n\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29,\n\n43 (1983).\n\n                            B.     Choice of Law.\n\n              There is a potential choice of law problem lurking in the\n\ninterstices of this case.          A federal court sitting in diversity\n\njurisdiction is obliged to apply federal procedural law and state\n\nsubstantive law.      Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 465 (1965); Erie\n\nR.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938).            As judicial estoppel\n\nappears neither clearly procedural nor clearly substantive, there\n\nmay be a legitimate question as to whether federal or state law\n\n(here, New Hampshire law) should supply the rule of decision.\n\n              Having noted this question, we swiftly lay it to one\n\nside.   The parties have addressed the judicial estoppel issue on\n\nthe   frank    assumption   that    federal   standards     control   and    the\n\ndistrict court operated on that assumption.              See ASC II, 2003 WL\n\n358737, at *3 (citing federal precedents).           We have stated before,\n\nand today reaffirm, that \"[w]here . . . the parties have agreed\n\nabout what law governs, a federal court sitting in diversity is\n\nfree, if it chooses, to forgo independent analysis and accept the\n\nparties' agreement.\" Borden v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 935 F.2d\n\n370, 375 (1st Cir. 1991).           Although we have not heretofore had\n\noccasion to apply this tenet with regard to judicial estoppel,\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fother courts have done so.              See Ryan Oper'ns G.P. v. Santiam-\n\nMidwest    Lumber    Co.,   81   F.3d    355,   358    (3d    Cir.     1996);    Astor\n\nChauffeured Limousine Co. v. Runnfeldt Inv. Corp., 910 F.2d 1540,\n\n1551 (7th Cir. 1990). Accordingly, we proceed to analyze the issue\n\non   the   understanding     that   federal      law   supplies        the     rule    of\n\ndecision.\n\n            We add, moreover, that we would likely reach this same\n\nconclusion even without the parties' acquiescent behavior.                      It has\n\nlong been held that federal courts may bypass conflicting state\n\nrules of decision in favor of federal standards when positive\n\nconsiderations, such as the presence of a strong federal policy,\n\nmilitate in favor of employing federal standards.                      Byrd v. Blue\n\nRidge Rural Elec. Coop., 356 U.S. 525, 537-38 (1958).                             Such\n\ncountervailing       considerations      are    present      here.      The     aim   of\n\njudicial estoppel is to protect the integrity of the courts.                          New\n\nHampshire, 532 U.S. at 750.         Where, as here, both the putatively\n\nestopping conduct and the putatively estopped conduct occur in a\n\nfederal case, a federal court has a powerful institutional interest\n\nin   applying   federally-developed         principles        to     protect    itself\n\nagainst cynical manipulations.            See Hall v. GE Plastic Pac. PTE\n\nLtd., 327 F.3d 391, 395-96 (5th Cir. 2003).\n\n                C.    The Doctrine of Judicial Estoppel.\n\n            \"As a general matter, the doctrine of judicial estoppel\n\nprevents a litigant from pressing a claim that is inconsistent with\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fa   position   taken       by   that    litigant       either   in     a    prior   legal\n\nproceeding or in an earlier phase of the same legal proceeding.\"\n\nIntergen N.V. v. Grina, 344 F.3d 134, 144 (1st Cir. 2003); accord\n\nPegram v. Herdrich, 530 U.S. 211, 227 n.8 (2000).                       The doctrine's\n\nprimary utility is to safeguard the integrity of the courts by\n\npreventing parties from improperly manipulating the machinery of\n\nthe judicial system. New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 750; United States\n\nv. Levasseur, 846 F.2d 786, 792 (1st Cir. 1988).                  In line with this\n\nprophylactic purpose, courts typically invoke judicial estoppel\n\nwhen a litigant is \"playing fast and loose with the courts.\"\n\nPatriot Cinemas, Inc. v. Gen. Cinema Corp., 834 F.2d 208, 212 (1st\n\nCir. 1987) (quoting Scarano v. Cent. R. Co., 203 F.2d 510, 513 (3d\n\nCir. 1953)).\n\n           The contours of the doctrine are hazy, and there is no\n\nmechanical     test    for      determining      its   applicability.            See   New\n\nHampshire, 532 U.S. at 750-51; Patriot Cinemas, 834 F.2d at 212.\n\nEach case tends to turn on its own facts.                  It is, however, widely\n\nagreed that, at a minimum, two conditions must be satisfied before\n\njudicial estoppel can attach.              See, e.g., Hall, 327 F.3d at 396;\n\nHamilton v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 270 F.3d 778, 783-84 (9th\n\nCir. 2001); Levinson v. United States, 969 F.2d 260, 264-65 (7th\n\nCir. 1992); Edwards v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 690 F.2d 595, 599 (6th\n\nCir. 1982).         First,      the    estopping   position       and      the   estopped\n\nposition     must     be    directly      inconsistent,         that       is,   mutually\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\fexclusive.   See Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 82 (1st Cir. 1999);\n\nLevasseur, 846 F.2d at 794.        Second, the responsible party must\n\nhave succeeded in persuading a court to accept its prior position.\n\nLydon v. Boston Sand & Gravel Co., 175 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir. 1999);\n\nGens, 112 F.3d at 572-73.      The presence of these elements creates\n\nthe appearance that either the first court has been misled or the\n\nsecond   court   will    be   misled,   thus   raising   the   specter   of\n\ninconsistent determinations and endangering the integrity of the\n\njudicial process.       See New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 750-51.\n\n           While it is not a formal element of a claim of judicial\n\nestoppel, courts frequently consider a third factor:            absent an\n\nestoppel, would the party asserting the inconsistent position\n\nderive an unfair advantage?       Id. at 751.    Relatedly, courts often\n\ninquire as to whether judicial acceptance of a party's initial\n\nposition conferred a benefit on that party.        See, e.g., Levasseur,\n\n846 F.2d at 793; Patriot Cinemas, 834 F.2d at 213.               Judicial\n\nacceptance and partisan benefit normally are two sides of the same\n\ncoin (after all, it is unlikely that a party will advance a\n\nparticular position unless that position benefits its cause).            To\n\nthe extent that there is a separation, however, it is the court's\n\nacceptance of the party's argument, not the benefit flowing from\n\nthe acceptance, that primarily implicates judicial integrity.            See\n\nNew Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 750.         Thus, benefit is not a sine qua\n\nnon to the applicability of judicial estoppel.\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f          Synthesizing these various points, we recently concluded\n\nthat, in a prototypical case, judicial estoppel applies when \"a\n\nparty has adopted one position, secured a favorable decision, and\n\nthen taken a contradictory position in search of legal advantage.\"\n\nIntergen, 344 F.3d at 144.          It is against this nuanced backdrop\n\nthat we must evaluate the ruling below.\n\n                    D.    Application of the Doctrine.\n\n          The district court pronounced this to be \"precisely the\n\ncase for which the doctrine of judicial estoppel was created.\" ASC\n\nII, 2003 WL 358737, at *3.               After careful perscrutation of a\n\ntangled   record,        we   conclude    that   this   determination   fell\n\ncomfortably within the encincture of the court's discretion.\n\n          In its opposition to Synopsys's motion to dismiss, ASC\n\nasserted unequivocally that it was \"not claiming that defendant[]\n\nbreached an agreement to enter into a long term contract,\" but,\n\nrather, its contract claim was \"that LEDA breached its agreement to\n\nnegotiate in good faith.\" This was an unambiguous claim for breach\n\nof the LOU — no more and no less — and by characterizing the claim\n\nin that fashion, ASC danced out of reach of Synopsys's statute of\n\nfrauds defense.     Having skirted that pitfall, ASC then adopted a\n\nvastly different position.         In its objection to Synopsys's motion\n\nfor summary judgment, it asserted that its breach of contract claim\n\nrelated not to the LOU but to \"a permanent [oral] agreement . . .\n\nentered into by LEDA and ASC.\"\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f           These positions are totally inconsistent. ASC's argument\n\non summary judgment directly contradicts its prior disclaimer of a\n\nbreach of contract theory based on an alleged parol agreement.\n\nWhile \"holding a litigant to his stated intention not to pursue\n\ncertain claims is different from the 'classic' case of judicial\n\nestoppel,\" such inconsistencies may present an even \"stronger\n\nargument   than   do   the   classic    cases   for   application   of   the\n\ndoctrine.\"   Patriot Cinemas, 834 F.2d at 214 (emphasis in the\n\noriginal); accord Wagner v. Prof'l Eng'rs in Cal. Gov't, 354 F.3d\n\n1036, 1044 (9th Cir. 2004) (\"Judicial estoppel applies to a party's\n\nstated position    whether    it   is   an   expression   of   intention,   a\n\nstatement of fact, or a legal assertion.\").\n\n           The second element in the judicial estoppel calculus is\n\npresent in spades.      There is no question but that the district\n\ncourt bought what ASC was selling the first time around.             In its\n\norder denying Synopsys's motion to dismiss the breach of contract\n\nclaim, the court stated:\n\n           Synopsys mistakenly assumes that ASC is\n           claiming a breach of an oral agreement to\n           grant it an exclusive marketing agreement . .\n           . . It then challenges this purported claim\n           based on the statute of frauds. In reality,\n           ASC is claiming that LEDA breached its\n           contractual obligation to make a good faith\n           effort to negotiate a permanent marketing\n           agreement that initially covered the United\n           States and later was amended to include\n           Canada.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fASC I, 2001 WL 920029, at *2 n.2 (emphasis supplied).     The court\n\nthen relied on ASC's stated position to repulse Synopsys's statute\n\nof frauds assault and allow the breach of contract count to go\n\nforward.   See id. at *2.   To that extent, ASC derived a direct (if\n\ntemporary) benefit from its original position.\n\n           To cinch matters, ASC — if allowed to pursue its nascent\n\noral contract theory at summary judgment — would have gained an\n\nunfair advantage.   Relying on ASC's prior representation, Synopsys\n\nconducted discovery under the warranted assumption that it faced a\n\ncharge of failing to negotiate in good faith as called for by the\n\nLOU.   The factual predicate and legal elements of that charge are\n\nmaterially different from the factual predicate and legal elements\n\nof the charge that ASC attempted to advance at summary judgment.\n\nSynopsys had every reason to assume, based on ASC's previous\n\nstatements, that the oral contract theory was not in the case.   The\n\nunfairness is apparent.     Had the lower court allowed ASC to go\n\nforward with its revisionist claim, it would have been sanctioning\n\nwhat amounted to a sneak attack.\n\n           Given this background, we cannot fault the district\n\ncourt's determination that ASC was playing fast and loose.       The\n\ncourt's rescript paints a convincing picture of a litigant who took\n\none position, used that position to its advantage at the motion to\n\ndismiss stage, and later attempted to switch horses midstream to\n\nrevive a previously abandoned (and flatly inconsistent) claim. See\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fASC II, 2003 WL 358737, at *1-*3.             The court's findings encompass\n\nthe   basic    elements    of   judicial      estoppel:     the    assertion    of\n\ninconsistent positions and judicial acceptance of the original\n\nposition.     On abuse of discretion review, these findings are fully\n\nsupportable, as is the court's follow-on inference that ASC was\n\ncarrying out a game of bait and switch.\n\n              In   a   desperate   effort     to   blunt   the    force   of   this\n\nreasoning,     ASC     mounts   two   additional     arguments.       First,     it\n\nmaintains that applying judicial estoppel in this case would\n\ncountermand its right to plead in the alternative.                   See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 8(e)(2). In ASC's view, its first amended complaint should\n\nbe read as alleging, in the alternative, that LEDA/Synopsys not\n\nonly breached a duty, rooted in the LOU, to negotiate a permanent\n\nagreement in good faith, but also entered into and subsequently\n\nbreached an oral distribution agreement.\n\n              This is artful dodging.         Like the Fourth Circuit, Allen\n\nv. Zurich Ins. Co., 667 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir. 1982), we can\n\nenvision cases in which the doctrine of judicial estoppel comes\n\ninto tension with a party's right to plead in the alternative.\n\nHere, however, nothing in the first amended complaint suggests an\n\nattempt to plead in the alternative — and at the motion to dismiss\n\nstage, ASC expressly denied that it was proffering alternative\n\nclaims. On this record, the \"pleading in the alternative\" argument\n\nis a red herring.\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\f          ASC's final asseveration is that its conduct should be\n\nexcused because its shift in position was attributable to evidence\n\nunearthed during the course of pretrial discovery. To support this\n\nasseveration, it points to the deposition of its president, Carl\n\nKarrfault, taken in 2002 (well after the denial of the motion to\n\ndismiss), during which Karrfault offered an account of the October\n\n5 negotiations that tends to show the formation of a permanent\n\ndistribution contract.\n\n          This is smoke and mirrors.         We acknowledge that, in\n\nlimited   circumstances,    courts   have   recognized    a    good   faith\n\nexception to the operation of judicial estoppel.               See, e.g.,\n\nChaveriat v. Williams Pipe Line Co., 11 F.3d 1420, 1428 (7th Cir.\n\n1993) (stating that a court may reject estoppel when \"the position\n\nadopted in the first suit was clearly wrong yet had been advanced\n\nin good faith by the party now sought to be estopped\"); 18B Charles\n\nAlan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice\n\n& Procedure § 4477, at 583-87 (2d ed. 2002) (collecting cases); cf.\n\nIntergen, 344 F.3d at 144 (\"We would not want to institute a rule\n\n[of judicial estoppel] that unduly inhibits a plaintiff from\n\nappropriately adjusting its complaint either to correct errors or\n\nto accommodate facts learned during pretrial discovery.\"). For\n\nexample, that exception may be available if the responsible party\n\nshows that   the   new,   inconsistent   position   is   the   product   of\n\ninformation neither known nor readily available to it at the time\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fthe initial position was taken.   See, e.g., Chaveriat, 11 F.3d at\n\n1428; Konstandinis v. Chen, 626 F.2d 933, 939-40 (D.C. Cir. 1980);\n\nsee generally Wright, Miller & Cooper, supra § 4477, at 584 & n.57.\n\n          In this instance, ASC cannot colorably lay claim to the\n\nexception.   The newly discovered evidence to which it adverts\n\nconsists of the deposition testimony of its own president.   When a\n\ncorporation takes a litigation position, we think it both sensible\n\nand fair to impute to it the knowledge of its chief executive\n\nofficer. See United States v. Josleyn, 206 F.3d 144, 159 (1st Cir.\n\n2000); 3 William Meade Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of\n\nPrivate Corporations § 811, at 77-80 (perm. ed. 2002).       In all\n\nevents, Karrfault's recollection of the October 5 negotiations was\n\nreadily available to ASC at the inception of the litigation — and\n\nthat fact alone renders the exception inapplicable.     See, e.g.,\n\nCzajkowski v. City of Chicago, 810 F. Supp. 1428, 1437 (N.D. Ill.\n\n1993); see generally Wright, Miller & Cooper, supra § 4477, at 586\n\n(noting that a \"new understanding of the facts may not excuse a\n\nparty who has failed a standard of ordinary negligence\").\n\n          Our decision that the district court acted within the\n\nrealm of its discretion in estopping ASC from claiming a breach of\n\nan oral contract effectively ends this aspect of the case.       On\n\nsummary judgment, ASC abandoned its earlier \"failure to negotiate\n\nin good faith\" theory and the estoppel left it without an arguable\n\nground for opposing Synopsys's motion.   Hence, the district court\n\n\n                               -26-\n\facted appropriately in entering brevis disposition for Synopsys on\n\nthe breach of contract count.\n\nV.   THE MOTION FOR SANCTIONS\n\n            Synopsys moves for sanctions against ASC and its counsel\n\nbased upon three theories: (i) that ASC continued to prosecute its\n\nappeal even after the appeal became hopeless; (ii) that ASC made\n\nmisrepresentations in its brief and withheld material facts from\n\nthis court; and (iii) that ASC violated 1st Cir. R. 30(b)(1) by\n\nrefusing    to   cooperate   with   Synopsys    in   preparing   the   joint\n\nappendix.     Although the question is not free from doubt, we deny\n\nthe motion.\n\n                             A. Frivolousness.\n\n            Appellate sanctions are a means of discouraging litigants\n\nand their lawyers from either wasting an adversary's time and\n\nresources or burdening the court with obviously groundless appeals.\n\nSee Transnat'l Corp. v. Rodio & Ursillo, Ltd., 920 F.2d 1066, 1072\n\n(1st Cir. 1990); see also Fed. R. App. P. 38.            Synopsys insists\n\nthat this is such a case.        In its view, the appeal is frivolous\n\nbecause it is barred by res judicata.          See supra Part II.\n\n            \"An appeal is frivolous . . . when the appellant's legal\n\nposition is doomed to failure — and an objectively reasonable\n\nlitigant should have realized as much from the outset.\" Toscano v.\n\nChandris, S.A., 934 F.2d 383, 387 (1st Cir. 1991).               An appeal,\n\narguable at the outset, may become hopeless (and, thus, frivolous),\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fby reason of subsequent developments. Persisting in an appeal that\n\nplainly has become moot or foreclosed by the operation of res\n\njudicata would qualify under this branch of the frivolousness\n\ndoctrine. See, e.g., Westcott Constr. Corp. v. Firemen's Fund, 996\n\nF.2d 14, 15 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            In this case, ASC's appeal was arguable when taken. Even\n\nafter the proceedings in California ripened into a judgment,\n\nsignificant questions remained regarding the status of the supposed\n\nsettlement, the scope of the state court litigation, and the\n\nefficacy of the resulting judgment.       See supra Part II.   These\n\nuncertainties cast doubt over whether this appeal had become a dead\n\nman walking.    That doubt undermines the claim that persisting in\n\nthe appeal is sanctionable.    See, e.g., Ins. Co. of West v. County\n\nof McHenry, 328 F.3d 926, 929-30 (7th Cir. 2003); Carter v. C.I.R.,\n\n784 F.2d 1006, 1009 (9th Cir. 1986).\n\n                     B.   Material Misstatements.\n\n            Synopsys's exhortation that we should impose sanctions on\n\nASC for material omissions in its appellate brief raises a close\n\nquestion.     This exhortation relates largely to ASC's argument\n\nconcerning the trial court's denial of its motion to amend the\n\nmisrepresentation count.      See supra Part III(C).     Synopsys is\n\ncorrect in pointing out that ASC failed to mention in its brief\n\nthat it had opted to withdraw its motion to amend before the\n\ndistrict court denied that motion.      We have indicated before that\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\fbrazen misrepresentations in an appellant's brief can justify the\n\nimposition of sanctions.           Thomas v. Digital Equip. Corp., 880 F.2d\n\n1486, 1491 (1st Cir. 1989).              Given that benchmark, we certainly\n\npossess the authority to sanction the omission here.                      See, e.g.,\n\nid.     (sanctioning        an   appellant       for    omitting    material     facts\n\nconcerning discovery requests); Ortiz Villafane v. Segarra, 797\n\nF.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1986) (sanctioning an appellant for falsely\n\nclaiming that he had filed a motion to amend).\n\n               ASC's    explanation      is    that    the   district    court   never\n\nformally ruled on its motion to withdraw the misrepresentation\n\ncount, leading it to assume that the withdrawal had no legal\n\nsignificance.       This is less an explanation than a lame excuse, and\n\nwe find it wholly inadequate.                 We note, however, that Synopsys's\n\nother misstatement claims lack force.                  That is significant because\n\nthe misrepresentation claim was a sideshow — not the main event —\n\nand the misleading omission was so easily exposed that it caused\n\nneither Synopsys nor this court an iota of extra work.                    Courts may,\n\nas a matter of discretion, decline to impose sanctions. See, e.g.,\n\nOakville Dev. Corp. v. FDIC, 986 F.2d 611, 615 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nUnder    the    circumstances       of    this    case,      we   find   that    course\n\nadvisable.\n\n                       C.   Noncompliance with Local Rules.\n\n               Synopsys's final ground for sanctions relates to 1st Cir.\n\nR. 30(b)(1).        That rule provides in pertinent part that \"[t]he\n\n\n                                          -29-\n\fparties are encouraged to agree on the contents of the appendix.\"\n\nId.    It then provides for various steps that must be taken in the\n\nabsence of an agreement.\n\n               In    the     last    analysis,        the   rule   merely      encourages\n\ncooperation; it does not mandate it.                     Moreover, experience teaches\n\nthat the encouraged cooperation invariably entails a certain amount\n\nof pulling and hauling.              As to the alternative steps that ASC was\n\nexpected to take in the absence of an agreement, the record\n\nconsists mostly of finger-pointing and is insufficient to allow us\n\nto assess the magnitude of the claimed violations.                         Finally, the\n\nrule imposes correlative obligations on an appellee, and the record\n\non    appeal    is     too       sparse   to    warrant      pinning     the   blame   for\n\ntransgressions exclusively on ASC.                       Cf. Quinones-Pacheco v. Am.\n\nAirlines,      Inc.,       979    F.2d    1,   8   n.9    (1st   Cir.    1992)   (denying\n\nsanctions and observing that \"[t]he lemon should not be allowed to\n\nreap a reward for calling the grapefruit sour\").                        Consequently, we\n\neschew any award of sanctions on this ground.\n\nVI.    CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further. For the reasons alluded to above,\n\nwe deny Synopsys's motion to dismiss this appeal; affirm the\n\ndistrict court's decision to dismiss ASC's misrepresentation claim\n\nand to deny the subsequent motion to amend that claim; uphold the\n\nentry of summary judgment on the breach of contract claim; and\n\n\n\n\n                                               -30-\n\fdecline to impose sanctions. Withal, we direct that costs be taxed\n\nin favor of Synopsys (as the prevailing party).\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -31-\n\f",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party (here, ASC) and draw all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. Because there are differences between the ground rules that apply to motions to dismiss as opposed to motions for summary judgment, <i>compare Chongris v. Bd. of Appeals,</i> 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir.1987) (explaining that the factual averments contained in the plaintiff's complaint supply the template for review of a decision granting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss), <i>with Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that the evidence of record supplies the template for review of a decision granting a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment), we adjust for those differences in our ensuing discussion of the district court's rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ASC is a New Hampshire corporation involved in the design and marketing of programs used in the production of computer chips. On March 29, 1999, it entered into a letter of understanding (the LOU) with LEDA, a French software designer. In the LOU, LEDA appointed ASC as the exclusive distributor of its Proton product line in the United States for a six-month term commencing April 1, 1999. The parties further declared that they would attempt to \"negotiate in good faith a permanent agreement based on experiences during the term of th[e] LOU.\" That declaration was purely aspirational; the LOU stated expressly that neither party had any obligation to enter such a permanent agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the next six months, the two firms engaged in sporadic negotiations. On September 1, 1999, their representatives met in France in hopes of hammering out the details of a permanent arrangement. Although LEDA's managing director assured ASC that \"all was satisfactory with regard to a permanent agreement,\" the parties neither developed nor signed a written contract. Later that month, the parties exchanged e-mails that apparently extended the geographic coverage of the LOU to Canada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Talks continued past the LOU's expiration date (September 30, 1999). On October 5, representatives of the two companies met in Florida. LEDA agreed to extend the LOU for a reasonable time pending the completion of negotiations. It also notified a prospective customer that ASC remained the exclusive distributor of LEDA products in the United States and Canada. ASC claims that the parties had by then substantially agreed on the key terms of a permanent distribution relationship, but the fact remains that LEDA balked at signing such an agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January of 2000, Synopsys (a California-based competitor of ASC) acquired LEDA. It promptly terminated the interim distribution agreement and broke off the negotiations for a permanent relationship. ASC was left out in the cold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ASC lost little time in bringing this diversity action against Synopsys in New Hampshire's federal district court. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a). Its first amended complaint charged that LEDA had been derelict in its duty to negotiate a permanent distribution agreement in good faith; that LEDA had intentionally misrepresented the nature of its interactions with Synopsys; that LEDA had flouted an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and that Synopsys bore responsibility for these transgressions as LEDA's successor in interest. Finally, the first amended complaint charged Synopsys, in its own right, with having interfered with ASC's advantageous contractual relations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Synopsys moved to jettison the complaint for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). On August 2, 2001, the district court dismissed the misrepresentation claim on the ground that ASC had not pleaded misrepresentation with the requisite particularity. <i>ASC v. Synopsys, Inc.,</i> No. 00-546, 2001 WL 920029, at *2 (D.N.H. Aug.2, 2001) (<i>ASC I</i>). Nevertheless, the court refused to dismiss the breach of contract claim. <i>See id.</i> A period of protracted pretrial discovery commenced. Eighteen months later, the district court granted Synopsys's motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract count.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>ASC v. Synopsys, Inc.,</i> No. 00-546, 2003 WL 358737, at *3 (D.N.H. Feb.19, 2003) (<i>ASC II</i>). That ended the suit and precipitated this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to put the arguments on appeal into workable perspective, we pause to provide additional detail anent the lower court's treatment of ASC's breach of contract claim. Count I of the first amended complaint alleged that \"Synopsys/LEDA breached its agreement to negotiate a permanent agreement in good faith and to honor the Canadian distributorship.\" In support of its motion to dismiss, Synopsys argued in relevant part that, to the extent this claim was premised on an oral contract entered into between the parties following the execution of the LOU, it was barred by the statute of frauds. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 506:2 (providing that \"[n]o action shall be brought ... upon any agreement ... that is not to be performed within one year from the time of making it, unless such ... agreement ... is in writing\"). In its opposition, ASC clarified that it was \"not claiming that [LEDA/Synopsys] breached an agreement to enter into a long term contract.\" Rather, its breach of contract claim was \"that LEDA breached its agreement to negotiate in good faith\" as required by the LOU.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court took ASC at its word. Noting that ASC had explicitly abandoned any claim that the parties had entered a subsequent oral agreement, the court treated ASC's cause of action as one \"that LEDA breached its contractual obligation to make a good faith effort to negotiate a permanent marketing agreement that initially covered the United States and later was amended to include Canada.\" <i>ASC I,</i> 2001 WL 920029, at *2 n. 2. Since the court tentatively deemed the statute of frauds impuissant to defeat this cause of action, it denied the motion to dismiss the breach of contract count. <i>Id.</i> at *2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time that discovery had run its course and the parties had gotten around to filing cross-motions for summary judgment, ASC had experienced an epiphany. In its summary judgment papers, it alleged that on October 5, 1999, the parties entered into an oral distribution agreement covering the United States and Canada. It also averred that LEDA/Synopsys subsequently breached this permanent arrangement. Synopsys vociferously objected to this changed tune. It maintained that this approach evinced a new and inconsistent theory; that, throughout the litigation, ASC had construed its breach of contract claim as a claim for breach of a duty to negotiate in good faith; and that this tergiversation resulted in a theory that fell outside the purview of the first amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed with Synopsys's assessment. It invoked the doctrine of judicial estoppel, pointing out that ASC had obtained an \"advantage by contending in opposition to Synopsys's motion to dismiss that its breach of contract claim was premised on an alleged breach of the LOU, rather than a subsequent oral agreement to make the LOU permanent.\" <i>ASC II,</i> 2003 WL 358737, at *3. Accordingly, the court held that ASC was barred from advancing a contradictory position on summary judgment. <i>Id.</i> The court thereupon granted brevis dispositon in favor of Synopsys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, ASC contends that the lower court erred in (i) dismissing its misrepresentation claim, (ii) refusing to allow a further amended complaint designed to cure defects in the misrepresentation count, and (iii) invoking the doctrine of judicial estoppel to bar the breach of contract claim that it wished to propound on summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Synopsys, by motion, asks us to (i) dismiss the appeal, and (ii) award sanctions against ASC. We address these points below, starting with Synopsys's motion to dismiss, then confronting ASC's asseverational array, and ending with a consideration of the request for sanctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE MOTION TO DISMISS THE APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this case was pending in the district court, Synopsys filed a California state court action accusing ASC of conspiracy and unfair business practices. On April 1, 2003 &#8212; shortly after the institution of this appeal &#8212; the parties reached at least a tentative settlement in the California action. There is some indication that the terms of the settlement contemplated the dismissal of the earlier (New Hampshire) action. After Synopsys encountered resistance from ASC with respect to implementing the supposed settlement, it asked the California court to enter judgment pursuant to the settlement agreement. The court obliged, albeit without discussion, entering judgment ex parte on September 11, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing these facts, Synopsys invites us to dismiss this appeal as moot and/or barred by the doctrine of res judicata.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> ASC counters by asserting that the settlement was never consummated. It also contends that the California judgment was entered without proper notice (and is, therefore, void).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline Synopsys's invitation to short-circuit this appeal. The record and briefing before us are too skimpy to allow a definitive determination as to either the status or scope of the ostensible settlement. By like token, the record is inadequate to permit us to assess the res judicata effect of the California judgment. Given the need for more information, we deem it prudent to sidestep the late-emerging res judicata issue and proceed directly to the merits. <i>See, e.g., Henry v. Connolly,</i> 910 F.2d 1000, 1004 (1st Cir.1990) (deciding appeal on merits, favorably to appellees, without deciding whether action was barred by res judicata or lack of standing); <i>see also Penobscot Nation v. Ga.-Pac. Corp.,</i> 254 F.3d 317, 324 (1st Cir.2001) (discussing limits of Supreme Court plurality decision in <i>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998)). Any other course would be an exercise in batrachomyomachia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.

The Civil Rules explicitly require that \"[i]n all averments of fraud ... the circumstances constituting fraud ... shall be stated with particularity.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b).

Boston Cooper Corp.,</i> 926 F.2d 109, 111 (1st Cir.1991); <i>McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc.,</i> 633 F.2d 226, 228 (1st Cir.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Original Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ASC's first amended complaint alleged in substance that LEDA failed to disclose that merger talks were ongoing between it and Synopsys, but, rather, downplayed the discussions and characterized the contemplated relationship as merely a \"technical partnership\" that would not affect the outcome of the ASC-LEDA negotiations. ASC further alleged that it relied on these knowingly false representations to its detriment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Despite the fervor with which ASC denounced this treachery, it did not provide any details as to who allegedly uttered the misleading statements, to whom they were made, where they were made, when they occurred, and what actions they engendered. <i>See ASC I,</i> 2001 WL 920029, at *2. In short, ASC's misrepresentation claim was wholly conclusory and lacking any semblance of specific detail. Given the strictures of Rule 9(b), the district court's dismissal of that barebones claim was entirely proper. <i>See, e.g., Powers,</i> 926 F.2d at 111; <i>Lopez v. Bulova Watch Co.,</i> 582 F.Supp. 755, 766 (D.R.I.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Curative Amendment.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ASC's fallback position is as insubstantial as a house built upon the shifting sands. It notes that, after the district court had dismissed the misrepresentation claim for want of specificity, it moved for leave to refile, in a further amended complaint, a more particularized version of the claim. The district court denied this request on February 14, 2003, and ASC now calumnizes that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This challenge is based on a half-truth. Although ASC did seek leave to file a curative amendment, it unilaterally withdrew that motion before the court reached the matter. A party who voluntarily withdraws a motion prior to judicial consideration cannot later claim that the court's pro forma denial of the withdrawn motion constitutes reversible error. <i>See Baty v. United States,</i> 275 F.2d 310, 311 (9th Cir.1960) (per curiam); <i>cf. United States v.

THE BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, invoking the doctrine of judicial estoppel, consigned ASC's breach of contract claim to the scrap heap. <i>ASC II,</i> 2003 WL 358737, at *3. ASC assigns error and seeks reversal of the summary judgment entered in favor of Synopsys on that claim. We examine the particulars of this contretemps below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Applicable Legal Standards.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's disposition of a motion for summary judgment de novo, scrutinizing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <i>See Garside,</i> 895 F.2d at 48. We will affirm only if the \"pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has not yet had occasion to determine the appropriate standard for reviewing a trial court's application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel. <i>See Gens v. Resolution Trust Corp.,</i> 112 F.3d 569, 572 n. 2 (1st Cir.1997) (reserving the question); <i>Desjardins v. Van Buren Cmty. Hosp.,</i> 37 F.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir.1994) (same). This case requires us to fill that void. We hold that the applicable rubric is abuse of discretion. We ground this holding on four lines of reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Supreme Court has explained that \"judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its discretion.\" <i>New Hampshire v. Maine,</i> 532 U.S. 742, 750, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). On that basis, the abuse of discretion standard seems a natural fit. <i>Cf. Pierce v. Underwood,</i> 487 U.S. 552, 558, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (noting that matters consigned to a trial court's discretion are generally reviewed for abuse of discretion). Second, deferential review often is appropriate for matters in which the trial court is \"better positioned... to decide the issue in question.\" <i>Miller v. Fenton,</i> 474 U.S. 104, 114, 106 S.Ct. 445, 88 L.Ed.2d 405 (1985). Judicial estoppel is such a matter. Determining whether a litigant is playing fast and loose with the courts has a subjective element. Its resolution draws upon the trier's intimate knowledge of the case at bar and his or her first-hand observations of the lawyers and their litigation strategies. Third, abuse of discretion is a flexible standard, and the amorphous nature of judicial estoppel, <i>cf. Desjardins,</i> 37 F.3d at 23 (observing that \"judicial estoppel is not extrinsically a matter of fact or law; the issues that arise may turn out to be ones of raw fact, abstract law, or something in between\"), places a high premium on such flexibility. <i>See Underwood,</i> 487 U.S. at 562, 108 S.Ct. 2541 (suggesting discretionary review for \"multifarious and novel question[s], little susceptible... of useful generalization\"). Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; the other courts of appeals to have addressed this question have settled unanimously on abuse of discretion review. <i>See, e.g., Coastal Plains, Inc. v. Mims</i> (<i>In re Coastal Plains, Inc.</i>), 179 F.3d 197, 205 (5th Cir.1999); <i>Talavera v. Sch. Bd.,</i> 129 F.3d 1214, 1216 (11th Cir.1997); <i>McNemar v. Disney Store, Inc.,</i> 91 F.3d 610, 616-17 (3d Cir.1996); <i>Data Gen. Corp. v. Johnson,</i> 78 F.3d 1556, 1565 (Fed.Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Garcia,</i> 37 F.3d 1359, 1367 (9th Cir.1994). A court of appeals should always be reluctant to create a circuit split without a compelling reason, and none exists here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that this case arises in the summary judgment context does not affect our decision to review the trial court's determination for abuse of discretion. Although there may seem at first blush to be some tension between the plenary review afforded to a summary judgment ruling and the deferential review of a threshold judicial estoppel determination, that tension is more apparent than real. Most evidentiary determinations are reviewed for abuse of discretion, <i>see, e.g., Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am.,</i> 100 F.3d 203, 212-13 (1st Cir.1996); <i>Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l, Inc.,</i> 81 F.3d 1148, 1158 (1st Cir.1996), and the same standard of review typically applies to threshold evidentiary determinations made in connection with summary judgment motions, <i>see, e.g., Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner,</i> 522 U.S. 136, 142-43, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997) (holding that an appellate court should review a trial court's decision to admit or exclude expert testimony at summary judgment for abuse of discretion); <i>Schubert v. Nissan Motor Corp.,</i> 148 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.1998) (holding that if the district court determines the admissibility of evidence for purposes of a summary judgment proceeding, the court of appeals must \"review that decision for abuse of discretion prior to turning to [its] <i>de novo</i> summary judgment examination\"); <i>EEOC v. Green,</i> 76 F.3d 19, 24 (1st Cir.1996) (discussing the district court's \"broad authority to prescribe the evidentiary materials it will consider in deciding a motion for summary judgment\" and conducting appellate review for abuse of discretion). Evidentiary rulings have the potential to shape and winnow the scope of the summary judgment inquiry, and a trial court should have as much leeway in dealing with those matters at the summary judgment stage as at trial. As other courts have recognized, judicial estoppel fits neatly into this taxonomy. <i>See, e.g., Ahrens v. Perot Sys. Corp.,</i> 205 F.3d 831, 833 (5th Cir.2000); <i>Johnson v. Oregon,</i> 141 F.3d 1361, 1364 (9th Cir.1998); <i>Talavera,</i> 129 F.3d at 1216. We adopt that standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The abuse of discretion standard is familiar. We will not overturn a nisi prius court's discretionary decision unless it plainly appears that the court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the proper factors. <i>In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.,</i> 859 F.2d 1007, 1019 (1st Cir.1988); <i>In re Josephson,</i> 218 F.2d 174, 182 (1st Cir.1954) (Magruder, C.J.). This standard is deferential and requires that a reviewing court remain mindful of its obligation \"not to substitute its judgment for that of the [district court].\" <i>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,</i> 463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Choice of Law.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a potential choice of law problem lurking in the interstices of this case. A federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction is obliged to apply federal procedural law and state substantive law. <i>Hanna v. Plumer,</i> 380 U.S. 460, 465, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965); <i>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins,</i> 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). As judicial estoppel appears neither clearly procedural nor clearly substantive, there may be a legitimate question as to whether federal or state law (here, New Hampshire law) should supply the rule of decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having noted this question, we swiftly lay it to one side. The parties have addressed the judicial estoppel issue on the frank assumption that federal standards control and the district court operated on that assumption. <i>See ASC II,</i> 2003 WL 358737, at *3 (citing federal precedents). We have stated before, and today reaffirm, that \"[w]here ... the parties have agreed about what law governs, a federal court sitting in diversity is free, if it chooses, to forgo independent analysis and accept the parties' agreement.\" <i>Borden v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,</i> 935 F.2d 370, 375 (1st Cir.1991). Although we have not heretofore had occasion to apply this tenet with regard to judicial estoppel, other courts have done so. <i>See Ryan Oper'ns G.P. v. Santiam-Midwest Lumber Co.,</i> 81 F.3d 355, 358 (3d Cir.1996); <i>Astor Chauffeured Limousine Co. v. Runnfeldt Inv. Corp.,</i> 910 F.2d 1540, 1551 (7th Cir.1990). Accordingly, we proceed to analyze the issue on the understanding that federal law supplies the rule of decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that we would likely reach this same conclusion even without the parties' acquiescent behavior. It has long been held that federal courts may bypass conflicting state rules of decision in favor of federal standards when positive considerations, such as the presence of a strong federal policy, militate in favor of employing federal standards. <i>Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Coop.,</i> 356 U.S. 525, 537-38, 78 S.Ct. 893, 2 L.Ed.2d 953 (1958). Such countervailing considerations are present here. The aim of judicial estoppel is to protect the integrity of the courts. <i>New Hampshire,</i> 532 U.S. at 750, 121 S.Ct. 1808. Where, as here, both the putatively estopping conduct and the putatively estopped conduct occur in a federal case, a federal court has a powerful institutional interest in applying federally-developed principles to protect itself against cynical manipulations. <i>See Hall v. GE Plastic Pac. PTE Ltd.,</i> 327 F.3d 391, 395-96 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Doctrine of Judicial Estoppel.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"As a general matter, the doctrine of judicial estoppel prevents a litigant from pressing a claim that is inconsistent with a position taken by that litigant either in a prior legal proceeding or in an earlier phase of the same legal proceeding.\" <i>InterGen N.V. v. Grina,</i> 344 F.3d 134, 144 (1st Cir.2003); <i>accord Pegram v. Herdrich,</i> 530 U.S. 211, 227 n. 8, 120 S.Ct. 2143, 147 L.Ed.2d 164 (2000). The doctrine's primary utility is to safeguard the integrity of the courts by preventing parties from improperly manipulating the machinery of the judicial system. <i>New Hampshire,</i> 532 U.S. at 750, 121 S.Ct. 1808; <i>United States v. Levasseur,</i> 846 F.2d 786, 792 (1st Cir.1988). In line with this prophylactic purpose, courts typically invoke judicial estoppel when a litigant is \"playing fast and loose with the courts.\" <i>Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. Gen. Cinema Corp.,</i> 834 F.2d 208, 212 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting <i>Scarano v. Cent. R. Co.,</i> 203 F.2d 510, 513 (3d Cir.1953)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contours of the doctrine are hazy, and there is no mechanical test for determining its applicability. <i>See New Hampshire,</i> 532 U.S. at 750-51, 121 S.Ct. 1808; <i>Patriot Cinemas,</i> 834 F.2d at 212. Each case tends to turn on its own facts. It is, however, widely agreed that, at a minimum, two conditions must be satisfied before judicial estoppel can attach. <i>See, e.g., Hall,</i> 327 F.3d at 396; <i>Hamilton v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.,</i> 270 F.3d 778, 783-84 (9th Cir.2001); <i>Levinson v. United States,</i> 969 F.2d 260, 264-65 (7th Cir.1992); <i>Edwards v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.,</i> 690 F.2d 595, 599 (6th Cir.1982). First, the estopping position and the estopped position must be directly inconsistent, that is, mutually exclusive. <i>See Faigin v. Kelly,</i> 184 F.3d 67, 82 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Levasseur,</i> 846 F.2d at 794. Second, the responsible party must have succeeded in persuading a court to accept its prior position. <i>Lydon v. Boston Sand &amp; Gravel Co.,</i> 175 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Gens,</i> 112 F.3d at 572-73. The presence of these elements creates the appearance that either the first court has been misled or the second court will be misled, thus raising the specter of inconsistent determinations and endangering the integrity of the judicial process. <i>See New Hampshire,</i> 532 U.S. at 750-51, 121 S.Ct. 1808.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is not a formal element of a claim of judicial estoppel, courts frequently consider a third factor: absent an estoppel, would the party asserting the inconsistent position derive an unfair advantage? <i>Id.</i> at 751, 121 S.Ct. 1808. Relatedly, courts often inquire as to whether judicial acceptance of a party's initial position conferred a benefit on that party. <i>See, e.g., Levasseur,</i> 846 F.2d at 793; <i>Patriot Cinemas,</i> 834 F.2d at 213. Judicial acceptance and partisan benefit normally are two sides of the same coin (after all, it is unlikely that a party will advance a particular position unless that position benefits its cause). To the extent that there is a separation, however, it is the court's acceptance of the party's argument, not the benefit flowing from the acceptance, that primarily implicates judicial integrity. <i>See New Hampshire,</i> 532 U.S. at 750, 121 S.Ct. 1808. Thus, benefit is not a sine qua non to the applicability of judicial estoppel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Synthesizing these various points, we recently concluded that, in a prototypical case, judicial estoppel applies when \"a party has adopted one position, secured a favorable decision, and then taken a contradictory position in search of legal advantage.\" <i>InterGen,</i> 344 F.3d at 144. It is against this nuanced backdrop that we must evaluate the ruling below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Application of the Doctrine.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court pronounced this to be \"precisely the case for which the doctrine of judicial estoppel was created.\" <i>ASC II,</i> 2003 WL 358737, at *3. After careful perscrutation of a tangled record, we conclude that this determination fell comfortably within the encincture of the court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opposition to Synopsys's motion to dismiss, ASC asserted unequivocally that it was \"not claiming that defendant[] breached an agreement to enter into a long term contract,\" but, rather, its contract claim was \"that LEDA breached its agreement to negotiate in good faith.\" This was an unambiguous claim for breach of the LOU &#8212; no more and no less &#8212; and by characterizing the claim in that fashion, ASC danced out of reach of Synopsys's statute of frauds defense. Having skirted that pitfall, ASC then adopted a vastly different position. In its objection to Synopsys's motion for summary judgment, it asserted that its breach of contract claim related not to the LOU but to \"a permanent [oral] agreement ... entered into by LEDA and ASC.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These positions are totally inconsistent. ASC's argument on summary judgment directly contradicts its prior disclaimer of a breach of contract theory based on an alleged parol agreement. While \"holding a litigant to his stated intention not to pursue certain claims is different from the `classic' case of judicial estoppel,\" such inconsistencies may present an even \"<i>stronger</i> argument than do the classic cases for application of the doctrine.\" <i>Patriot Cinemas,</i> 834 F.2d at 214 (emphasis in the original); <i>accord Wagner v. Prof'l Eng'rs in Cal. Gov't,</i> 354 F.3d 1036, 1044 (9th Cir.2004) (\"Judicial estoppel applies to a party's stated position whether it is an expression of intention, a statement of fact, or a legal assertion.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second element in the judicial estoppel calculus is present in spades. There is no question but that the district court bought what ASC was selling the first time around. In its order denying Synopsys's motion to dismiss the breach of contract claim, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Synopsys mistakenly assumes that ASC is claiming a breach of an oral agreement to grant it an exclusive marketing agreement.... It then challenges this purported claim based on the statute of frauds. In reality, <i>ASC is claiming that LEDA breached its contractual obligation to make a good faith effort to negotiate a permanent marketing agreement that initially covered the United States and later was amended to include Canada.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>ASC I,</i> 2001 WL 920029, at *2 n. 2 (emphasis supplied). The court then relied on ASC's stated position to repulse Synopsys's statute of frauds assault and allow the breach of contract count to go forward. <i>See id.</i> at *2. To that extent, ASC derived a direct (if temporary) benefit from its original position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, ASC &#8212; if allowed to pursue its nascent oral contract theory at summary judgment &#8212; would have gained an unfair advantage. Relying on ASC's prior representation, Synopsys conducted discovery under the warranted assumption that it faced a charge of failing to negotiate in good faith as called for by the LOU. The factual predicate and legal elements of that charge are materially different from the factual predicate and legal elements of the charge that ASC attempted to advance at summary judgment. Synopsys had every reason to assume, based on ASC's previous statements, that the oral contract theory was not in the case. The unfairness is apparent. Had the lower court allowed ASC to go forward with its revisionist claim, it would have been sanctioning what amounted to a sneak attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this background, we cannot fault the district court's determination that ASC was playing fast and loose. The court's rescript paints a convincing picture of a litigant who took one position, used that position to its advantage at the motion to dismiss stage, and later attempted to switch horses midstream to revive a previously abandoned (and flatly inconsistent) claim. <i>See ASC II,</i> 2003 WL 358737, at *1-*3. The court's findings encompass the basic elements of judicial estoppel: the assertion of inconsistent positions and judicial acceptance of the original position. On abuse of discretion review, these findings are fully supportable, as is the court's follow-on inference that ASC was carrying out a game of bait and switch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a desperate effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, ASC mounts two additional arguments. First, it maintains that applying judicial estoppel in this case would countermand its right to plead in the alternative. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(e)(2). In ASC's view, its first amended complaint should be read as alleging, in the alternative, that LEDA/Synopsys not only breached a duty, rooted in the LOU, to negotiate a permanent agreement in good faith, but also entered into and subsequently breached an oral distribution agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is artful dodging. Like the Fourth Circuit, <i>Allen v. Zurich Ins. Co.,</i> 667 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1982), we can envision cases in which the doctrine of judicial estoppel comes into tension with a party's right to plead in the alternative. Here, however, nothing in the first amended complaint suggests an attempt to plead in the alternative &#8212; and at the motion to dismiss stage, ASC expressly denied that it was proffering alternative claims. On this record, the \"pleading in the alternative\" argument is a red herring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ASC's final asseveration is that its conduct should be excused because its shift in position was attributable to evidence unearthed during the course of pretrial discovery. To support this asseveration, it points to the deposition of its president, Carl Karrfault, taken in 2002 (well after the denial of the motion to dismiss), during which Karrfault offered an account of the October 5 negotiations that tends to show the formation of a permanent distribution contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is smoke and mirrors. We acknowledge that, in limited circumstances, courts have recognized a good faith exception to the operation of judicial estoppel. <i>See, e.g., Chaveriat v. Williams Pipe Line Co.,</i> 11 F.3d 1420, 1428 (7th Cir.1993) (stating that a court may reject estoppel when \"the position adopted in the first suit was clearly wrong yet had been advanced in good faith by the party now sought to be estopped\"); 18B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 4477, at 583-87 (2d ed.2002) (collecting cases); <i>cf. InterGen,</i> 344 F.3d at 144 (\"We would not want to institute a rule [of judicial estoppel] that unduly inhibits a plaintiff from appropriately adjusting its complaint either to correct errors or to accommodate facts learned during pretrial discovery.\"). For example, that exception may be available if the responsible party shows that the new, inconsistent position is the product of information neither known nor readily available to it at the time the initial position was taken. <i>See, e.g., Chaveriat,</i> 11 F.3d at 1428; <i>Konstantinidis v. Chen,</i> 626 F.2d 933, 939-40 (D.C.Cir.1980); <i>see generally</i> Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <i>supra</i> &#167; 4477, at 584 &amp; n. 57.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, ASC cannot colorably lay claim to the exception. The newly discovered evidence to which it adverts consists of the deposition testimony <i>of its own president.</i> When a corporation takes a litigation position, we think it both sensible and fair to impute to it the knowledge of its chief executive officer. <i>See United States v. Josleyn,</i> 206 F.3d 144, 159 (1st Cir.2000); 3 William Meade Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations &#167; 811, at 77-80 (perm. ed.2002). In all events, Karrfault's recollection of the October 5 negotiations was readily available to ASC at the inception of the litigation &#8212; and that fact alone renders the exception inapplicable. <i>See, e.g., Czajkowski v. City of Chicago,</i> 810 F.Supp. 1428, 1437 (N.D.Ill.1992); <i>see generally</i> Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <i>supra</i> &#167; 4477, at 586 (noting that a \"new understanding of the facts may not excuse a party who has failed a standard of ordinary negligence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision that the district court acted within the realm of its discretion in estopping ASC from claiming a breach of an oral contract effectively ends this aspect of the case. On summary judgment, ASC abandoned its earlier \"failure to negotiate in good faith\" theory and the estoppel left it without an arguable ground for opposing Synopsys's motion. Hence, the district court acted appropriately in entering brevis disposition for Synopsys on the breach of contract count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. THE MOTION FOR SANCTIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Synopsys moves for sanctions against ASC and its counsel based upon three theories: (i) that ASC continued to prosecute its appeal even after the appeal became hopeless; (ii) that ASC made misrepresentations in its brief and withheld material facts from this court; and (iii) that ASC violated 1st Cir. R. 30(b)(1) by refusing to cooperate with Synopsys in preparing the joint appendix. Although the question is not free from doubt, we deny the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Frivolousness.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate sanctions are a means of discouraging litigants and their lawyers from either wasting an adversary's time and resources or burdening the court with obviously groundless appeals. <i>See Transnat'l Corp. v. Rodio &amp; Ursillo, Ltd.,</i> 920 F.2d 1066, 1072 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also</i> Fed. R.App. P. 38. Synopsys insists that this is such a case. In its view, the appeal is frivolous because it is barred by res judicata. <i>See supra</i> Part II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"An appeal is frivolous ... when the appellant's legal position is doomed to failure &#8212; and an objectively reasonable litigant should have realized as much from the outset.\" <i>Toscano v. Chandris, S.A.,</i> 934 F.2d 383, 387 (1st Cir.1991). An appeal, arguable at the outset, may become hopeless (and, thus, frivolous), by reason of subsequent developments. Persisting in an appeal that plainly has become moot or foreclosed by the operation of res judicata would qualify under this branch of the frivolousness doctrine. <i>See, e.g., Westcott Constr. Corp. v. Firemen's Fund,</i> 996 F.2d 14, 15 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, ASC's appeal was arguable when taken. Even after the proceedings in California ripened into a judgment, significant questions remained regarding the status of the supposed settlement, the scope of the state court litigation, and the efficacy of the resulting judgment. <i>See supra</i> Part II. These uncertainties cast doubt over whether this appeal had become a dead man walking. That doubt undermines the claim that persisting in the appeal is sanctionable. <i>See, e.g., Ins. Co. of West v. County of McHenry,</i> 328 F.3d 926, 929-30 (7th Cir.2003); <i>Carter v. C.I.R.,</i> 784 F.2d 1006, 1009 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Material Misstatements.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Synopsys's exhortation that we should impose sanctions on ASC for material omissions in its appellate brief raises a close question. This exhortation relates largely to ASC's argument concerning the trial court's denial of its motion to amend the misrepresentation count. <i>See supra</i> Part III(C). Synopsys is correct in pointing out that ASC failed to mention in its brief that it had opted to withdraw its motion to amend before the district court denied that motion. We have indicated before that brazen misrepresentations in an appellant's brief can justify the imposition of sanctions. <i>Thomas v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> 880 F.2d 1486, 1491 (1st Cir.1989). Given that benchmark, we certainly possess the authority to sanction the omission here. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> (sanctioning an appellant for omitting material facts concerning discovery requests); <i>Ortiz Villafane v. Segarra,</i> 797 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1986) (sanctioning an appellant for falsely claiming that he had filed a motion to amend).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ASC's explanation is that the district court never formally ruled on its motion to withdraw the misrepresentation count, leading it to assume that the withdrawal had no legal significance. This is less an explanation than a lame excuse, and we find it wholly inadequate. We note, however, that Synopsys's other misstatement claims lack force. That is significant because the misrepresentation claim was a sideshow &#8212; not the main event &#8212; and the misleading omission was so easily exposed that it caused neither Synopsys nor this court an iota of extra work. Courts may, as a matter of discretion, decline to impose sanctions. <i>See, e.g., Oakville Dev. Corp. v. FDIC,</i> 986 F.2d 611, 615 n. 5 (1st Cir.1993). Under the circumstances of this case, we find that course advisable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Noncompliance with Local Rules.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Synopsys's final ground for sanctions relates to 1st Cir. R. 30(b)(1). That rule provides in pertinent part that \"[t]he parties are encouraged to agree on the contents of the appendix.\" <i>Id.</i> It then provides for various steps that must be taken in the absence of an agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, the rule merely encourages cooperation; it does not mandate it. Moreover, experience teaches that the encouraged cooperation invariably entails a certain amount of pulling and hauling. As to the alternative steps that ASC was expected to take in the absence of an agreement, the record consists mostly of finger-pointing and is insufficient to allow us to assess the magnitude of the claimed violations. Finally, the rule imposes correlative obligations on an appellee, and the record on appeal is too sparse to warrant pinning the blame for transgressions exclusively on ASC. <i>Cf. Quinones-Pacheco v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,</i> 979 F.2d 1, 8 n. 9 (1st Cir.1992) (denying sanctions and observing that \"[t]he lemon should not be allowed to reap a reward for calling the grapefruit sour\"). Consequently, we eschew any award of sanctions on this ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons alluded to above, we deny Synopsys's motion to dismiss this appeal; affirm the district court's decision to dismiss ASC's misrepresentation claim and to deny the subsequent motion to amend that claim; uphold the entry of summary judgment on the breach of contract claim; and decline to impose sanctions. Withal, we direct that costs be taxed in favor of Synopsys (as the prevailing party).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So Ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In other pretrial rulings, the district court dismissed ASC's implied covenant claim and granted summary judgment for Synopsys on ASC's interference claim.

On March 29, 1999, it entered into a letter of understanding (the LOU) with LEDA, a French software designer. In the LOU, LEDA appointed ASC as the exclusive distributor of its Proton product line in the United States for a six-month term commencing April 1, 1999. The parties further declared that they would attempt to \"negotiate in good faith a permanent agreement based on experiences during the term of th[e] LOU.\" That declaration was purely aspirational; the LOU stated expressly that neither party had any obligation to enter such a permanent agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the next six months, the two firms engaged in sporadic negotiations. On September 1, 1999, their representatives met in France in hopes of hammering out the details of a permanent arrangement. Although LEDA's managing director assured ASC that \"all was satisfactory with regard to a permanent agreement,\" the parties neither developed nor signed a written contract. Later that month, the parties exchanged e-mails that apparently extended the geographic coverage of the LOU to Canada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Talks continued past the LOU's expiration date (September 30, 1999). On October 5, representatives of the two companies met in Florida. LEDA agreed to extend the LOU for a reasonable time pending the completion of negotiations. It also notified a prospective customer that ASC remained the exclusive distributor of LEDA products in the United States and Canada. ASC claims that the parties had by then substantially agreed on the key terms of a permanent distribution relationship, but the fact remains that LEDA balked at signing such an agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January of 2000, Synopsys (a California-based competitor of ASC) acquired LEDA.

Its first amended complaint charged that LEDA had been derelict in its duty to negotiate a permanent distribution agreement in good faith; that LEDA had intentionally misrepresented the nature of its interactions with Synopsys; that LEDA had flouted an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and that Synopsys bore responsibility for these transgressions as LEDA's successor in interest.

Count I of the first amended complaint alleged that \"Synopsys/LEDA breached its agreement to negotiate a permanent agreement in good faith and to honor the Canadian distributorship.\" In support of its motion to dismiss, Synopsys argued in relevant part that, to the extent this claim was premised on an oral contract entered into between the parties following the execution of the LOU, it was barred by the statute of frauds. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 506:2 (providing that \"[n]o action shall be brought ... upon any agreement ... that is not to be performed within one year from the time of making it, unless such ... agreement ... is in writing\"). In its opposition, ASC clarified that it was \"not claiming that [LEDA/Synopsys] breached an agreement to enter into a long term contract.\" Rather, its breach of contract claim was \"that LEDA breached its agreement to negotiate in good faith\" as required by the LOU.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court took ASC at its word. Noting that ASC had explicitly abandoned any claim that the parties had entered a subsequent oral agreement, the court treated ASC's cause of action as one \"that LEDA breached its contractual obligation to make a good faith effort to negotiate a permanent marketing agreement that initially covered the United States and later was amended to include Canada.\" <i>ASC I,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">920029</span></span>, at *2 n. 2. Since the court tentatively deemed the statute of frauds impuissant to defeat this cause of action, it denied the motion to dismiss the breach of contract count. <i>Id.</i> at *2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time that discovery had run its course and the parties had gotten around to filing cross-motions for summary judgment, ASC had experienced an epiphany. In its summary judgment papers, it alleged that on October 5, 1999, the parties entered into an oral distribution agreement covering the United States and Canada. It also averred that LEDA/Synopsys subsequently breached this permanent arrangement. Synopsys vociferously objected to this changed tune. It maintained that this approach evinced a new and inconsistent theory; that, throughout the litigation, ASC had construed its breach of contract claim as a claim for breach of a duty to negotiate in good faith; and that this tergiversation resulted in a theory that fell outside the purview of the first amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed with Synopsys's assessment. It invoked the doctrine of judicial estoppel, pointing out that ASC had obtained an \"advantage by contending in opposition to Synopsys's motion to dismiss that its breach of contract claim was premised on an alleged breach of the LOU, rather than a subsequent oral agreement to make the LOU permanent.\" <i>ASC II,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">358737</span></span>, at *3. Accordingly, the court held that ASC was barred from advancing a contradictory position on summary judgment. <i>Id.</i> The court thereupon granted brevis dispositon in favor of Synopsys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, ASC contends that the lower court erred in (i) dismissing its misrepresentation claim, (ii) refusing to allow a further amended complaint designed to cure defects in the misrepresentation count, and (iii) invoking the doctrine of judicial estoppel to bar the breach of contract claim that it wished to propound on summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Synopsys, by motion, asks us to (i) dismiss the appeal, and (ii) award sanctions against ASC. We address these points below, starting with Synopsys's motion to dismiss, then confronting ASC's asseverational array, and ending with a consideration of the request for sanctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE MOTION TO DISMISS THE APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this case was pending in the district court, Synopsys filed a California state court action accusing ASC of conspiracy and unfair business practices. On April 1, 2003 &#8212; shortly after the institution of this appeal &#8212; the parties reached at least a tentative settlement in the California action. There is some indication that the terms of the settlement contemplated the dismissal of the earlier (New Hampshire) action. After Synopsys encountered resistance from ASC with respect to implementing the supposed settlement, it asked the California court to enter judgment pursuant to the settlement agreement.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">968</span></a></span> (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). On that basis, the abuse of discretion standard seems a natural fit. <i>Cf. Pierce v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span> (1988) (noting that matters consigned to a trial court's discretion are generally reviewed for abuse of discretion). Second, deferential review often is appropriate for matters in which the trial court is \"better positioned... to decide the issue in question.\" <i>Miller v. Fenton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111542\"><a href=\"/opinion/111542/miller-v-fenton/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 114, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111542\"><a href=\"/opinion/111542/miller-v-fenton/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span> (1985). Judicial estoppel is such a matter. Determining whether a litigant is playing fast and loose with the courts has a subjective element. Its resolution draws upon the trier's intimate knowledge of the case at bar and his or her first-hand observations of the lawyers and their litigation strategies. Third, abuse of discretion is a flexible standard, and the amorphous nature of judicial estoppel, <i>cf. Desjardins,</i> 37 F.3d at 23 (observing that \"judicial estoppel is not extrinsically a matter of fact or law; the issues that arise may turn out to be ones of raw fact, abstract law, or something in between\"), places a high premium on such flexibility. <i>See Underwood,</i> 487 U.S. at 562, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112137\"><a href=\"/opinion/112137/pierce-v-underwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although there may seem at first blush to be some tension between the plenary review afforded to a summary judgment ruling and the deferential review of a threshold judicial estoppel determination, that tension is more apparent than real. Most evidentiary determinations are reviewed for abuse of discretion, <i>see, e.g., Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N.

Evidentiary rulings have the potential to shape and winnow the scope of the summary judgment inquiry, and a trial court should have as much leeway in dealing with those matters at the summary judgment stage as at trial. As other courts have recognized, judicial estoppel fits neatly into this taxonomy. <i>See, e.g., Ahrens v. Perot Sys.

Relatedly, courts often inquire as to whether judicial acceptance of a party's initial position conferred a benefit on that party. <i>See, e.g., Levasseur,</i> 846 F.2d at 793; <i>Patriot Cinemas,</i> 834 F.2d at 213. Judicial acceptance and partisan benefit normally are two sides of the same coin (after all, it is unlikely that a party will advance a particular position unless that position benefits its cause). To the extent that there is a separation, however, it is the court's acceptance of the party's argument, not the benefit flowing from the acceptance, that primarily implicates judicial integrity. <i>See New Hampshire,</i> 532 U.S. at 750, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118435\"><a href=\"/opinion/118435/new-hampshire-v-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is against this nuanced backdrop that we must evaluate the ruling below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Application of the Doctrine.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court pronounced this to be \"precisely the case for which the doctrine of judicial estoppel was created.\" <i>ASC II,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">358737</span></span>, at *3. After careful perscrutation of a tangled record, we conclude that this determination fell comfortably within the encincture of the court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opposition to Synopsys's motion to dismiss, ASC asserted unequivocally that it was \"not claiming that defendant[] breached an agreement to enter into a long term contract,\" but, rather, its contract claim was \"that LEDA breached its agreement to negotiate in good faith.\" This was an unambiguous claim for breach of the LOU &#8212; no more and no less &#8212; and by characterizing the claim in that fashion, ASC danced out of reach of Synopsys's statute of frauds defense. Having skirted that pitfall, ASC then adopted a vastly different position. In its objection to Synopsys's motion for summary judgment, it asserted that its breach of contract claim related not to the LOU but to \"a permanent [oral] agreement ... entered into by LEDA and ASC.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These positions are totally inconsistent. ASC's argument on summary judgment directly contradicts its prior disclaimer of a breach of contract theory based on an alleged parol agreement. While \"holding a litigant to his stated intention not to pursue certain claims is different from the `classic' case of judicial estoppel,\" such inconsistencies may present an even \"<i>stronger</i> argument than do the classic cases for application of the doctrine.\" <i>Patriot Cinemas,</i> 834 F.2d at 214 (emphasis in the original); <i>accord Wagner v. Prof'l Eng'rs in Cal. Gov't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784736\"><a href=\"/opinion/784736/j-richard-wagner-and-kristin-schwall-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-all/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></a></span>, 1044 (9th Cir.2004) (\"Judicial estoppel applies to a party's stated position whether it is an expression of intention, a statement of fact, or a legal assertion.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second element in the judicial estoppel calculus is present in spades. There is no question but that the district court bought what ASC was selling the first time around. In its order denying Synopsys's motion to dismiss the breach of contract claim, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Synopsys mistakenly assumes that ASC is claiming a breach of an oral agreement to grant it an exclusive marketing agreement.... It then challenges this purported claim based on the statute of frauds. In reality, <i>ASC is claiming that LEDA breached its contractual obligation to make a good faith effort to negotiate a permanent marketing agreement that initially covered the United States and later was amended to include Canada.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>ASC I,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">920029</span></span>, at *2 n. 2 (emphasis supplied). The court then relied on ASC's stated position to repulse Synopsys's statute of frauds assault and allow the breach of contract count to go forward. <i>See id.</i> at *2. To that extent, ASC derived a direct (if temporary) benefit from its original position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, ASC &#8212; if allowed to pursue its nascent oral contract theory at summary judgment &#8212; would have gained an unfair advantage. Relying on ASC's prior representation, Synopsys conducted discovery under the warranted assumption that it faced a charge of failing to negotiate in good faith as called for by the LOU. The factual predicate and legal elements of that charge are materially different from the factual predicate and legal elements of the charge that ASC attempted to advance at summary judgment. Synopsys had every reason to assume, based on ASC's previous statements, that the oral contract theory was not in the case. The unfairness is apparent. Had the lower court allowed ASC to go forward with its revisionist claim, it would have been sanctioning what amounted to a sneak attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this background, we cannot fault the district court's determination that ASC was playing fast and loose. The court's rescript paints a convincing picture of a litigant who took one position, used that position to its advantage at the motion to dismiss stage, and later attempted to switch horses midstream to revive a previously abandoned (and flatly inconsistent) claim. <i>See ASC II,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">358737</span></span>, at *1-*3. The court's findings encompass the basic elements of judicial estoppel: the assertion of inconsistent positions and judicial acceptance of the original position. On abuse of discretion review, these findings are fully supportable, as is the court's follow-on inference that ASC was carrying out a game of bait and switch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a desperate effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, ASC mounts two additional arguments. First, it maintains that applying judicial estoppel in this case would countermand its right to plead in the alternative. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(e)(2). In ASC's view, its first amended complaint should be read as alleging, in the alternative, that LEDA/Synopsys not only breached a duty, rooted in the LOU, to negotiate a permanent agreement in good faith, but also entered into and subsequently breached an oral distribution agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is artful dodging. Like the Fourth Circuit, <i>Allen v. Zurich Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398597\"><a href=\"/opinion/398597/grady-allen-v-zurich-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1162</span></a></span>, 1167 (4th Cir.1982), we can envision cases in which the doctrine of judicial estoppel comes into tension with a party's right to plead in the alternative. Here, however, nothing in the first amended complaint suggests an attempt to plead in the alternative &#8212; and at the motion to dismiss stage, ASC expressly denied that it was proffering alternative claims. On this record, the \"pleading in the alternative\" argument is a red herring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ASC's final asseveration is that its conduct should be excused because its shift in position was attributable to evidence unearthed during the course of pretrial discovery. To support this asseveration, it points to the deposition of its president, Carl Karrfault, taken in 2002 (well after the denial of the motion to dismiss), during which Karrfault offered an account of the October 5 negotiations that tends to show the formation of a permanent distribution contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is smoke and mirrors. We acknowledge that, in limited circumstances, courts have recognized a good faith exception to the operation of judicial estoppel. <i>See, e.g., Chaveriat v. Williams Pipe Line Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658807\"><a href=\"/opinion/658807/harry-f-chaveriat-jr-v-williams-pipe-line-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1420</span></a></span>, 1428 (7th Cir.1993) (stating that a court may reject estoppel when \"the position adopted in the first suit was clearly wrong yet had been advanced in good faith by the party now sought to be estopped\"); 18B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.

The newly discovered evidence to which it adverts consists of the deposition testimony <i>of its own president.</i> When a corporation takes a litigation position, we think it both sensible and fair to impute to it the knowledge of its chief executive officer. <i>See United States v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1428</span></span>, 1437 (N.D.Ill.1992); <i>see generally</i> Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <i>supra</i> &#167; 4477, at 586 (noting that a \"new understanding of the facts may not excuse a party who has failed a standard of ordinary negligence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision that the district court acted within the realm of its discretion in estopping ASC from claiming a breach of an oral contract effectively ends this aspect of the case. On summary judgment, ASC abandoned its earlier \"failure to negotiate in good faith\" theory and the estoppel left it without an arguable ground for opposing Synopsys's motion. Hence, the district court acted appropriately in entering brevis disposition for Synopsys on the breach of contract count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. THE MOTION FOR SANCTIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Synopsys moves for sanctions against ASC and its counsel based upon three theories: (i) that ASC continued to prosecute its appeal even after the appeal became hopeless; (ii) that ASC made misrepresentations in its brief and withheld material facts from this court; and (iii) that ASC violated 1st Cir. R. 30(b)(1) by refusing to cooperate with Synopsys in preparing the joint appendix. Although the question is not free from doubt, we deny the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Frivolousness.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate sanctions are a means of discouraging litigants and their lawyers from either wasting an adversary's time and resources or burdening the court with obviously groundless appeals. <i>See Transnat'l Corp. v. Rodio &amp; Ursillo, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552772\"><a href=\"/opinion/552772/transnational-corp-v-rodio-ursillo-ltd-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1066</span></a></span>, 1072 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also</i> Fed. R.App. P. 38. Synopsys insists that this is such a case. In its view, the appeal is frivolous because it is barred by res judicata. <i>See supra</i> Part II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"An appeal is frivolous ... when the appellant's legal position is doomed to failure &#8212; and an objectively reasonable litigant should have realized as much from the outset.\" <i>Toscano v. Chandris, S.A.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562036\"><a href=\"/opinion/562036/frank-toscano-v-chandris-sa/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 387 (1st Cir.1991). An appeal, arguable at the outset, may become hopeless (and, thus, frivolous), by reason of subsequent developments. Persisting in an appeal that plainly has become moot or foreclosed by the operation of res judicata would qualify under this branch of the frivolousness doctrine. <i>See, e.g., Westcott Constr. Corp. v. Firemen's Fund,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609221\"><a href=\"/opinion/609221/westcott-construction-corp-v-firemens-fund-of-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, ASC's appeal was arguable when taken. Even after the proceedings in California ripened into a judgment, significant questions remained regarding the status of the supposed settlement, the scope of the state court litigation, and the efficacy of the resulting judgment. <i>See supra</i> Part II. These uncertainties cast doubt over whether this appeal had become a dead man walking. That doubt undermines the claim that persisting in the appeal is sanctionable. <i>See, e.g., Ins. Co. of West v. County of McHenry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781922\"><a href=\"/opinion/781922/insurance-company-of-the-west-v-county-of-mchenry-indeck-pleasant-valley/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span>, 929-30 (7th Cir.2003); <i>Carter v. C.I.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"465274\"><a href=\"/opinion/465274/norman-d-carter-and-cecilia-p-carter-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1006</span></a></span>, 1009 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Material Misstatements.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Synopsys's exhortation that we should impose sanctions on ASC for material omissions in its appellate brief raises a close question. This exhortation relates largely to ASC's argument concerning the trial court's denial of its motion to amend the misrepresentation count. <i>See supra</i> Part III(C). Synopsys is correct in pointing out that ASC failed to mention in its brief that it had opted to withdraw its motion to amend before the district court denied that motion. We have indicated before that brazen misrepresentations in an appellant's brief can justify the imposition of sanctions. <i>Thomas v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526968\"><a href=\"/opinion/526968/samuel-thomas-v-digital-equipment-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1486</span></a></span>, 1491 (1st Cir.1989). Given that benchmark, we certainly possess the authority to sanction the omission here. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> (sanctioning an appellant for omitting material facts concerning discovery requests); <i>Ortiz Villafane v. Segarra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474182\"><a href=\"/opinion/474182/rene-ortiz-villafane-v-louis-a-segarra-individually-and-doing-business/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1986) (sanctioning an appellant for falsely claiming that he had filed a motion to amend).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ASC's explanation is that the district court never formally ruled on its motion to withdraw the misrepresentation count, leading it to assume that the withdrawal had no legal significance. This is less an explanation than a lame excuse, and we find it wholly inadequate. We note, however, that Synopsys's other misstatement claims lack force. That is significant because the misrepresentation claim was a sideshow &#8212; not the main event &#8212; and the misleading omission was so easily exposed that it caused neither Synopsys nor this court an iota of extra work. Courts may, as a matter of discretion, decline to impose sanctions. <i>See, e.g., Oakville Dev. Corp. v. FDIC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600737\"><a href=\"/opinion/600737/oakville-development-corporation-trustee-of-the-10-12-lopez-st-trust-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span>, 615 n. 5 (1st Cir.1993). Under the circumstances of this case, we find that course advisable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Noncompliance with Local Rules.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Synopsys's final ground for sanctions relates to 1st Cir. R. 30(b)(1). That rule provides in pertinent part that \"[t]he parties are encouraged to agree on the contents of the appendix.\" <i>Id.</i> It then provides for various steps that must be taken in the absence of an agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, the rule merely encourages cooperation; it does not mandate it. Moreover, experience teaches that the encouraged cooperation invariably entails a certain amount of pulling and hauling. As to the alternative steps that ASC was expected to take in the absence of an agreement, the record consists mostly of finger-pointing and is insufficient to allow us to assess the magnitude of the claimed violations. Finally, the rule imposes correlative obligations on an appellee, and the record on appeal is too sparse to warrant pinning the blame for transgressions exclusively on ASC. <i>Cf. Quinones-Pacheco v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"594418\"><a href=\"/opinion/594418/valentin-quinones-pacheco-v-american-airlines-inc-valentin/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 n. 9 (1st Cir.1992) (denying sanctions and observing that \"[t]he lemon should not be allowed to reap a reward for calling the grapefruit sour\"). Consequently, we eschew any award of sanctions on this ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons alluded to above, we deny Synopsys's motion to dismiss this appeal; affirm the district court's decision to dismiss ASC's misrepresentation claim and to deny the subsequent motion to amend that claim; uphold the entry of summary judgment on the breach of contract claim; and decline to impose sanctions. Withal, we direct that costs be taxed in favor of Synopsys (as the prevailing party).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So Ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In other pretrial rulings, the district court dismissed ASC's implied covenant claim and granted summary judgment for Synopsys on ASC's interference claim.
