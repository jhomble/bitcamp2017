The district  court granted the\n\ndefendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims that the\n\nIOLTA  program  violated  their  First  Amendment  rights  of\n\nfreedom  of speech and association, and  effected a taking of\n\ntheir  property  in violation  of  the  Fifth and  Fourteenth\n\nAmendments.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          Traditionally,  in  Massachusetts   and  in   other\n\nstates, clients' funds which lawyers held for a short term or\n\nin nominal  amounts were deposited into  non-interest bearing\n\npooled trust accounts.  See, e.g., In Re Mass. Bar Ass'n, 478\n                                                        \n\nN.E.2d  715, 716 (Mass. 1985);  In Re Minn.

Banking  laws and the\n\nethical obligation  of lawyers to maintain  clients' funds so\n\nthat  they  were   immediately  available  for  reimbursement\n\nprevented such  pooled trust accounts from accruing interest.\n\nCone v.

Interest earned by pooled\n            \n\ntrust accounts remained  with the  banking institution  which\n\nheld  the funds. Id.  With  the advent of Negotiable Order of\n                    \n\nWithdrawal  (\"NOW\")  accounts   authorized  by  the  Consumer\n\nChecking Account  Equity Act,  interest  became available  on\n\n                             -4-\n\nchecking accounts  for eligible depositors.

During  the late\n     \n\n1970's and through the 1980's, Florida and many  other states\n\nproposed  IOLTA  programs  and  courts  upheld  the  programs\n\nfinding  them  constitutionally  and ethically  permissible.1\n\nAs of  January, 1992, forty-nine  states and the  District of\n\nColumbia  had authorized  IOLTA  programs.

Attorneys could elect to  participate by establishing\n\nan interest-bearing IOLTA account and by complying with DR 9-\n\n102(C)  requirements  which  included  choosing  a  recipient\n\ncharity from a group designated by the IOLTA Committee. \n\n          In  1989, the Massachusetts  Supreme Judicial Court\n\n(\"SJC\")  converted   the  voluntary  IOLTA  program   into  a\n\nmandatory  program  by  amending the  IOLTA  Rule,  effective\n\nJanuary  1,  1990.    As  amended,  the   rule  required  all\n\nMassachusetts  lawyers to deposit  client funds into interest\n\nbearing accounts:  either  (1) a pooled IOLTA account  if, in\n\nthe  judgment of  the lawyer,  the  deposits were  nominal in\n\namount or to  be held for only a short period of time; or (2)\n\nindividual  accounts for  all other client  funds.   The Rule\n\nrequired lawyers  or law  firms to  direct the  banks holding\n\ntheir  IOLTA  accounts  to  disburse accrued  interest  to  a\n\ncharitable entity selected by the lawyer or firm from a group\n\ndesignated  by  the  SJC.    The  designated  charities  were\n\nMassachusetts   Legal   Assistance,  the   Massachusetts  Bar\n\nFoundation, and the Boston Bar Foundation.\n\n          The  SJC again  amended the  IOLTA Rule,  effective\n\nJanuary 1,  1993, to change  the process for  disbursement of\n\nIOLTA funds.2   The IOLTA Rule  now vests responsibility  for\n\n                    \n\n2    The  Massachusetts Supreme  Judicial Court  amended Rule\n3:07, DR 9-102(C) by Order 92-18,  effective January 1, 1993.\nA copy  of DR 9-102 and the  amendment appear in the appendix\nfollowing this opinion.\n\n                             -6-\n\ndisbursement  of  IOLTA  funds  in the  IOLTA  Committee  and\n\neliminates choice by lawyers of recipient eligible charities.\n\nThe IOLTA Committee must  disburse sixty-seven percent of all\n\nIOLTA   funds  to  Massachusetts  Legal  Assistance  and  the\n\nremaining   thirty-three   percent   to   \"other   designated\n\ncharitable entities.\"\n\n          The parties  have not briefed or  argued any issues\n\nin  the context  of the  1993 amendment  to the  IOLTA Rule.3\n\nAlthough the  amendment of the IOLTA Rule affects the process\n\nof funds disbursement, the  changes are not material  to this\n\ndecision.   None  of the  parties  argued that  the  lawyers'\n\nchoice  of  recipient  charities,  as provided  by  the  1990\n\nversion  of the IOLTA Rule,  was significant.   The funds are\n\nstill  disbursed primarily to  Massachusetts Legal Assistance\n\nwith the remainder  to \"other designated eligible  charities\"\n\nwhich  are still  the  Massachusetts Bar  Foundation and  the\n\nBoston  Bar Foundation.   In addition,  the mission  of IOLTA\n\nfunds remains the same:   \"The Massachusetts Legal Assistance\n\nCorporation  may use  IOLTA  funds to  further its  corporate\n\npurpose and  other designated  charitable entitles  [sic] may\n\nuse IOLTA  funds either for (1)  improving the administration\n\nof justice or  (2) delivering civil  legal services to  those\n\nwho  cannot afford them.\"   Mass. Sup.  J. C. R.  3:07, DR 9-\n\n                    \n\n3    The Massachusetts  Attorney General's  Office sent  this\ncourt  a copy of the amendment to DR 9-102(C) by letter dated\nFebruary 12, 1993.  \n\n                             -7-\n\n102(C), as amended  by Order 92-18,  effective Jan. 1,  1993.\n                      \n\nThe  corporate purpose of  the Massachusetts Legal Assistance\n\nCorporation is to\n\n          provid[e]  financial  support  for  legal\n          assistance    programs    that    provide\n          representation  to   persons  financially\n          unable  to  afford  such   assistance  in\n          proceedings   or   matters   other   than\n          criminal  proceedings or  matters, except\n          those proceedings or matters in which the\n          commonwealth   is  required   to  provide\n          representation.\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 221A,   2 (West Supp. 1992).  \n\n          Unless   further   designation  is   necessary  for\n\nclarity,   we   will  refer   to   the  currently   effective\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court  Rule 3:07, DR  9-102(C)\n\nas \"DR 9-102(C)\" or the \"IOLTA Rule.\"     \n\nA.  The Plaintiffs' Claims\n                          \n\n          There  are five  plaintiffs  in this  action.   The\n\nWashington Legal  Foundation (\"WLF\") is a  non-profit, public\n\ninterest law and policy  center operating in Washington, D.C.\n\nKaren Parker is  a citizen of Massachusetts  who has employed\n\nlawyers in connection with her real estate business and other\n\nbusinesses, which  has resulted in her  money being deposited\n\nin  IOLTA  accounts.    Stephanie  Davis  is   a  citizen  of\n\nMassachusetts  who has  not  had her  money  placed in  IOLTA\n\naccounts, but she  anticipates that, in  the future, she  may\n\nneed to hire an  attorney which would cause  her money to  be\n\ndeposited  in  an IOLTA  account.   William  R. Tuttle  is an\n\n                             -8-\n\nattorney  practicing in  Abington, Massachusetts,  without an\n\nIOLTA  account.     Timothy  J.  Howes  is  an   attorney  in\n\nSpringfield,  Massachusetts,  where  he  maintains  an  IOLTA\n\naccount in the  Shawmut Bank.   Howes is suing  on behalf  of\n\nhimself  and  on  behalf  of  his  clients  whose  funds  are\n\ndeposited in his IOLTA account.  \n\n          The   defendants   are   the    Massachusetts   Bar\n\nFoundation,  the  Boston  Bar  Foundation,  the Massachusetts\n\nLegal Assistance  Corporation,  Katherine S.  McHugh (in  her\n\ncapacity as chair of the Massachusetts IOLTA Committee), Fran\n\nF.  Burns (in  his  capacity as  chair of  the  Board of  Bar\n\nOverseers), and the Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court of\n\nMassachusetts.  The plaintiffs  allege, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\n   1983, that they have  been deprived, under  color of state\n\nlaw,  of  their  rights  secured  by  the  First,  Fifth  and\n\nFourteenth Amendments of the Constitution by operation of the\n\nMassachusetts IOLTA program.  1.    Count  One:    First  and\n                                                             \n\nFourteenth Amendments\n                     \n\n          WLF alleges that it sent a check to cover costs and\n\nexpenses  related to  this  legal action  to a  Massachusetts\n\nattorney  (not a party to the action) who deposited the check\n\nin his IOLTA  account as required by the IOLTA  Rule.  Parker\n\nalleges  that she  has and  will continue  to use  lawyers in\n\nconnection  with her real estate business  and that her funds\n\n                             -9-\n\ndeposited with lawyers  have and will  be deposited in  IOLTA\n\naccounts.  WLF and Parker allege that:\n\n            The collection of  and use of interest,\n          under color of state law,  generated from\n          the   IOLTA   trust  account   of  [their\n          attorneys] for litigation, especially for\n          litigation  that  involves  political  or\n          ideological  causes, and  for legislative\n          or  other  forms  of   lobbying,  deprive\n          [them]  of  their  rights  to  freedom of\n          speech and association guaranteed  by the\n          First  and  Fourteenth Amendments  to the\n          U.S. Constitution. \n\n          Davis  alleges that  although she  has not  yet had\n\nmoney deposited in an IOLTA, the IOLTA Rule creates \"the risk\n\nthat  she  will be  forced  to  choose  between employing  an\n\nattorney or  financially supporting organizations  with which\n\nshe disagrees.\"   Davis alleges her constitutional claims  in\n\nsubstantially similar terms to  those quoted above.  Attorney\n\nHowes alleges that he has had to deposit client funds  in his\n\nIOLTA as required by the IOLTA Rule and that the Rule \"forces\n\n[him] to  choose  between not  practicing  law and  or  [sic]\n\npracticing  law  and  associating  with  organizations  whose\n\nactions  offend  his  political and  ideological  beliefs and\n\nthereby depriving him of  his right to freedom of  speech and\n\nassociation  as  guaranteed  by   the  First  and  Fourteenth\n\nAmendments  to  the U.S.  Constitution.\"    Finally, Attorney\n\nTuttle alleges that the IOLTA Rule has forced him \"to forego,\n\nto  his  professional  and  financial  detriment,  depositing\n\ncertain  client funds  into non-interest bearing  accounts in\n\n                             -10-\n\norder to avoid  associating with organizations whose  actions\n\noffend   his  political  and   ideological  beliefs\"  thereby\n\ndepriving him of the same constitutional rights as alleged by\n\nAttorney Howes.  \n\n          In  summary,  Count  I  alleges  violation  of  the\n\nplaintiffs' rights of freedom of speech and association.\n\n                             -11-\n\n     2.  Count Two:  Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\n                                                    \n\n          Plaintiffs WLF  and  Parker allege  that the  IOLTA\n\nRule constitutes an  illegal taking of the  beneficial use of\n\ntheir  funds for  public  use without  just compensation  and\n\nwithout  due process  of law  in violation  of the  Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments to the  Constitution.4  Howes makes the\n\nsame  claim on  behalf  of his  clients  whose funds  he  has\n\ndeposited into his IOLTA account.   Neither Davis, Howes  (on\n\nhis own behalf) nor Tuttle make claims under Count II. \n\n     3.  Relief Requested\n                         \n\n          The  plaintiffs ask for  declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief  to dismantle  the  operation of  the mandatory  IOLTA\n\nprogram.    Specifically,  the plaintiffs  request  that  the\n\ncourt:  (1) require  the  defendants to  refund the  interest\n\nwhich has been earned on their funds while in IOLTA accounts;\n\n(2)  declare  the  IOLTA  Rule void  as  an  unconstitutional\n\nviolation  of the  plaintiffs'  First, Fifth  and  Fourteenth\n\n                    \n\n4    The plaintiffs have not  pursued their claims alleged in\nCount III based  on the Fourteenth  Amendment that the  IOLTA\nprogram  has   unconstitutionally  deprived  them   of  their\nproperty  without  due  process  of  law.    The  plaintiffs'\nstatement   of   issues  on   appeal   is   limited  to   the\nconstitutional rights  of the plaintiffs under  the First and\nFifth Amendments.  Therefore,  we assume that the plaintiffs'\nclaims under the Fourteenth Amendment have been abandoned and\nare waived.  United  States v. Zannino, 895  F.2d 1, 17  (1st\n                                      \nCir.) cert. denied,  494 U.S.  1082 (1990).   Of course,  the\n                  \nFourteenth Amendment  is properly  included in each  count as\nthe  basis   upon  which   the  First  and   Fifth  Amendment\nprohibitions apply to the states.\n\n                             -12-\n\nAmendment rights; (3) issue permanent injunctions prohibiting\n\nthe defendants  from requiring  attorneys to comply  with the\n\nIOLTA  Rule and  from disciplining  attorneys for  failure to\n\ncomply with the IOLTA Rule; (4) issue a permanent  injunction\n\ndirecting  the   SJC  to  require  attorneys   to  make  full\n\ndisclosure to their  clients of  uses of IOLTA  funds if  the\n\nattorney  elects  to  participate  in IOLTA,  and  (5)  grant\n\nreasonable attorneys  fees to  the plaintiffs pursuant  to 42\n\nU.S.C.   1988.\n\nB.  Dismissal of Claims\n                       \n\n          The  defendants  moved to  dismiss  the plaintiffs'\n\naction on the grounds that their constitutional claims lacked\n\nmerit  and that some of the plaintiffs lacked standing.5  The\n\ndistrict court found that  there was no serious  dispute that\n\nat least  two  of  the  plaintiffs,  Parker  and  Howes,  had\n\nstanding to bring their  constitutional claims.  The district\n\ncourt  dismissed the  plaintiffs'  claims  holding \"that  the\n\nplaintiffs have no property interest  in the funds subject to\n\n                    \n\n5   On appeal, the  record includes only the defendants' bare\nmotion to dismiss which states the grounds as lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction and  failure to state a  claim upon which\nrelief  may be granted.   The  district court  summarized the\ndefendants' grounds  for the motion to  dismiss: \"In addition\nto arguing that the plaintiffs' constitutional challenges are\nwithout  merit, the  defendants contend  that  two plaintiffs\nlack standing.\"  Washington Legal Found., 795 F. Supp. at 52,\n                                        \nn.3.  We assume, therefore, that the defendants' assertion of\nlack  of  subject matter  jurisdiction  referred  to lack  of\nstanding.   \n\n                             -13-\n\nthe  SJC  Rule,\"  and  that  the  SJC  Rule  did  not  compel\n\nassociation  with speech and  \"speech, in  the constitutional\n\nsense,  is  not  a  factor   of  the  challenged  SJC  Rule.\"\n\nWashington  Legal Found., 795 F.  Supp. 50, 53,  56 (D. Mass.\n                        \n\n1992).  The plaintiffs  appeal the district court's dismissal\n\nof their claims.\n\nC.  Standard of Review\n                      \n\n          Our standard  of review of a  dismissal pursuant to\n\nFed. R. Civ.  P. 12(b)(6) is  well established.  We  begin by\n\naccepting all  well-pleaded facts as  true, and  we draw  all\n\nreasonable  inferences in favor of  the appellants.  Coyne v.\n                                                          \n\nCity  of Somerville, 972  F.2d 440,  442-43 (1st  Cir. 1992).\n                   \n\nBecause  a dismissal  terminates  an action  at the  earliest\n\nstages of  litigation without  a developed factual  basis for\n\ndecision, we  must carefully  balance the rule  of simplified\n\ncivil  pleading against  our  need for  more than  conclusory\n\nallegations.  Dewey v. University of New Hampshire, 694  F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1,  3 (1st  Cir. 1982),  cert. denied,  461 U.S.  944 (1983).\n                                     \n\nBecause only  well-pleaded facts are  taken as true,  we will\n\nnot  accept  a   complainant's  unsupported  conclusions   or\n\ninterpretations of law.  United States v. AVX Corp., 962 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n108,  115 (1st  Cir.  1992) (\"a  reviewing  court is  obliged\n\nneither    to    'credit   bald    assertions,   periphrastic\n\ncircumlocutions,  unsubstantiated  conclusions,  or  outright\n\nvituperation,'... nor to honor  subjective characterizations,\n\n                             -14-\n\noptimistic   predictions,   or   problematic   suppositions.\"\n\n(citations  omitted)).   We may  affirm the  district court's\n\norder on any independently  sufficient grounds.

Standing\n            \n\n          The issue of  standing has not  been raised by  the\n\nparties  on appeal,  and therefore  we address  standing only\n\nbecause  it  presents  a threshold  jurisdictional  question.\n\nBender v. Williamsport Area  School Dist., 475 U.S.  534, 541\n                                         \n\n(1986)  (\"every  federal   appellate  court  has   a  special\n\nobligation   to  'satisfy   itself  not   only  of   its  own\n\njurisdiction,  but also that of  the lower courts  in a cause\n\nunder  review,'  even  though  the parties  are  prepared  to\n\nconcede it.\" (citations omitted));  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n490,  498 (1975)  (\"[Standing] is  the threshold  question in\n\nevery  federal case, determining  the power  of the  court to\n\nentertain  the  suit.\").    Standing  requirements  are  most\n\nstrictly   enforced   in   cases   involving   constitutional\n\nquestions.  Bender, 475 U.S. at 541-42.\n                  \n\n          The standing  doctrine is derived from  Article III\n\nof the  Constitution which requires the existence  of a \"case\n\nor controversy\"  before  a claim may be resolved  by judicial\n\nprocess.  Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750 (1984).  To show\n                         \n\na  case  or  controversy,  a plaintiff  must  first  \"clearly\n\n                             -15-\n\ndemonstrate that he has suffered an 'injury in fact[]'\" which\n\nmeans   \"an  injury   to  himself   that  is   'distinct  and\n\npalpable,'... as opposed to  merely '[a]bstract,' ... and the\n\nalleged harm must be actual or imminent, not 'conjectural' or\n\nhypothetical.'\"   Whitmore  v.

Second, the claimant must allege\n\nfacts  which show \"that the  injury 'fairly can  be traced to\n\nthe challenged action' and, third, 'is likely to be redressed\n\nby  a favorable  decision.'\"   Id.

Our standing inquiry depends on whether the plaintiffs\n\nhave established the existence of a case or controversy as to\n\neach  of their  claims, but  does not  involve the  merits of\n\nparticular claims.  Warth, 422 U.S. at 500.\n                         \n\n          The district  court found  that at least  Howes and\n\nParker had standing to bring the constitutional challenges in\n\nthis  case.   Karen  Parker alleges  that  she has  and  will\n\ncontinue to  employ lawyers  for transactions related  to her\n\nbusiness  and that she has and  will have her funds placed in\n\nIOLTA accounts by the  lawyers she employs.  She  claims that\n\nthe  IOLTA  program  collects  and  uses  for  political  and\n\n                             -16-\n\nideological causes interest generated  by her funds placed in\n\nIOLTA  accounts, and  therefore  the operation  of the  IOLTA\n\nprogram deprives her of freedom  of speech and association in\n\nviolation of the  First Amendment.   Parker also claims  that\n\nthe  IOLTA  program  constitutes  an illegal  taking  of  the\n\nbeneficial use  of her funds  deposited in IOLTA  accounts in\n\nviolation of the  Fifth Amendment.   She asks  this court  to\n\ndeclare  the IOLTA  Rule unconstitutional  and to  enjoin the\n\noperation  of the rule.  Based upon her allegations, which we\n\ntake  as  true for  this purpose,  she  has stated  an actual\n\ninjury  to herself which is  traceable to the  IOLTA rule and\n\nwhich may  be remedied by  the relief sought.   We agree with\n\nthe district  court that Parker has standing  to maintain her\n\nclaims made in this action.\n\n          Howes presents  a more complex  standing situation.\n\nHowes  brings the First Amendment claim on his own behalf and\n\non  behalf of his clients, and the Fifth Amendment claim only\n\non behalf of  his clients.6  As to  the First Amendment claim\n\n                    \n\n6     Howes'  standing on  behalf  of third  parties  is more\ndifficult.  The general rule is that a plaintiff has standing\nto  assert only his own  rights, not those  of third parties.\nPlayboy Enterprises, Inc. v.

Howes also\n\nalleges  that the operation of  the IOLTA Rule  forces him to\n\nchoose between  practicing law and  not practicing  law.   He\n\nasks for  the  same  relief requested  by  Parker.    Without\n\naddressing the merits of Howes' personal claims, we find that\n\nhe  has  alleged  an injury  which  may  be  remedied by  the\n\nrequested  relief  which  is  sufficient  to  establish   his\n\nstanding to maintain his First Amendment claim.   \n\n          Because  we   find  that   at  least  two   of  the\n\nplaintiffs,  Parker,  a client,  and  Howes,  a lawyer,  have\n\nstanding  to maintain  each claim,  we need  not address  the\n\nstanding of all plaintiffs as to each claim.

We are not convinced that\n\nthe deposit of clients'  funds into IOLTA accounts transforms\n\na  lawyer's fiduciary  obligation  to clients  into a  formal\n\ntrust  with the reserved right  by the client  to control the\n\nbeneficial use of the funds as claimed by the plaintiffs.\n\n          The  plaintiffs   also  claim  that  they   have  a\n\nprotected  property   right  to   exclude  others   from  the\n\nbeneficial  use of  their funds while  they are  deposited in\n\nIOLTA  accounts.   In support  of the  right to  exclude, the\n\nplaintiffs rely on cases which have established that property\n\nowners  have  a right  to  exclude  others  from  their  real\n\n                             -22-\n\nproperty.

The physical invasion occurs, the plaintiffs\n\nargue,  because the  IOLTA program  borrows the  principal to\n\ngenerate income  by collecting  the interest earned  on IOLTA\n\naccounts.  The  plaintiffs do  not claim that  they have  any\n\nrights  to  the interest,  rather  they assert  the  right to\n\ncontrol  who  uses  and  benefits from  the  principal  which\n\ngenerates the  interest.

The  Court  found  that  the\n\ngovernment's regulation of the  marina amounted to a physical\n\ninvasion of  their private property  by the public,  and was,\n\ntherefore, an unconstitutional  taking of the  marina owners'\n\n                             -25-\n\nright to exclude others from their private property.

The\n\nCourt  found  that  the   regulation  authorized  a  physical\n\noccupation,   however  small,  of   the  plaintiff's  private\n\nproperty which was unconstitutional without compensation.\n\n          We  find no  logical  analogy between  the physical\n\ninvasion  of real property, as in Kaiser and Loretto, and the\n                                                    \n\noperation of the  IOLTA Rule.

Another Florida\n\n                             -26-\n\nstatute provided for a separate fee to be paid  to the county\n\nregistry  for holding  interpleaded funds.   The  Court first\n\ndetermined  that claimants  of the  interpleaded funds  had a\n\nproperty right to the  deposited funds.

Applying the general  rule that interest follows the\n\nprincipal,  the Court held that the  claimants had a property\n\nright to the interest accrued on the interpleaded funds.  Id.\n                                                             \n\nThe   Court   concluded  that   there   was   not  sufficient\n\njustification  for  the  county   to  take  the  interest  on\n\ninterpleaded  funds, which  was the  private property  of the\n\nclaimants, when the county registries were receiving fees for\n\nthe  costs related to holding the interpleaded funds.  Id. at\n                                                          \n\n164-65.    \n\n          Despite the some  superficial similarities  between\n\nWebb's  and this case, there is a fundamental difference.  In\n      \n\nWebb's,   the  Court   found  that   the  claimants   to  the\n      \n\ninterpleaded  fund had  a  recognized property  right to  the\n\ninterest  earned while  the  funds were  held  by the  county\n\nregistries.    In this  case, the  plaintiffs  do not  have a\n\nproperty  right to the interest earned on their funds held in\n\nIOLTA  accounts.  See Cone, 819 F.2d at 1006-07 (holding that\n                          \n\nplaintiffs had no right to interest earned on IOLTA  accounts\n\nand  discussing  implications  of  Webb's).    In  fact,  the\n                                         \n\nplaintiffs  recognize  this  and  claim  only  the intangible\n\nrights related to the beneficial use of deposited funds:  the\n\n                             -27-\n\nright  to control and exclude others.  The property rights of\n\nthe plaintiffs  here and the claimants  in Webb's, therefore,\n                                                 \n\nare different.   The Webb's claimants had  property rights to\n                           \n\naccrued interest which  is tangible personal  property, while\n\nplaintiffs in this case have claimed only intangible property\n\ninterests.\n\n          The  IOLTA program  does not  occupy or  invade the\n\nplaintiffs'  property  even temporarily:   the  IOLTA program\n\nleaves the  deposited funds  untouched, the funds  are always\n\navailable to clients as  required by DR 9-102(B)(4),  and the\n\ninterest  earned on  IOLTA  accounts is  not the  plaintiffs'\n\nproperty.  The property rights  claimed by the plaintiffs are\n\nintangible.   We  find no  logical or  legal support  for the\n\nplaintiffs'  claim  that  the  IOLTA  program  has  caused  a\n\nphysical invasion and occupation of their intangible property\n\nrights.             b.  Economic interference.\n                                              \n\n          Governmental  action through regulation  of the use\n\nof  private  property  does not  cause  a  taking  unless the\n\ninterference  is significant.    Andrus, 444  U.S. at  66-67.\n                                       \n\nHaving  found  no weight  to  the  plaintiffs' argument  that\n\ngovernmental  action through  the IOLTA  Rule has  effected a\n\nphysical invasion  of their property rights,  we consider the\n\neconomic factors which are significant to a takings claim the\n\neconomic  impact of  the  IOLTA Rule  on the  plaintiffs, and\n\n\"'the  extent to  which  the regulation  has interfered  with\n\n                             -28-\n\ndistinct  investment-backed  expectations.'\"   Connolly,  475\n                                                       \n\nU.S. at 225 (citations omitted).\n\n          The property  rights claimed by  the plaintiffs  do\n\nnot involve  clients' economic interests.   The claimed right\n\nto control and to  exclude others from the beneficial  use of\n\nfunds  held  by  lawyers  has  no  economic  benefit for  the\n\nplaintiffs because clients would not otherwise be entitled to\n\nthe  interest earned on  pooled accounts.   Plaintiffs do not\n\nclaim  and there are  no \"investment-backed\"  expectations in\n\nthe claimed rights of  clients to control and  exclude others\n\nfrom  the  beneficial  use  of deposited  funds  under  these\n\ncircumstances.  \n\n          In  sum,  the plaintiffs  claim,  at  best, a  thin\n\nstrand in the commonly  recognized bundle of property rights.\n\nUnder  the IOLTA  Rule,  the plaintiffs  retain the  right to\n\npossess, use and  dispose of the  principal sum deposited  in\n\nIOLTA  accounts.  \"At least  where an owner  possesses a full\n\n'bundle' of property rights,  the destruction of one 'strand'\n\nof the bundle is  not a taking, because the aggregate must be\n\nviewed  in  its  entirety.\"    Andrus,  444  U.S.  at  65-66.\n                                     \n\nWeighing the plaintiffs' claimed  property rights against the\n\nbundle  of rights  remaining  in their  deposited funds  left\n\nuntouched by the IOLTA  program, we find that the  IOLTA Rule\n\nhas   not   caused   a   taking   of   plaintiff's  property.\n\n                             -29-\n\nConsequently, we need not  weigh any burden caused  by taking\n\nprivate rights against the public benefit.\n\n          We  affirm,   albeit  on  different   grounds,  the\n\ndistrict court's  dismissal of  Count Two of  the plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint.\n\nB. The First Amendment Speech and Association Claim\n                                                   \n\n          The  plaintiffs claim  that the IOLTA  Rule compels\n\nlawyers, and  therefore clients, to participate  in the IOLTA\n\nprogram  and  thereby  support lobbying  and  litigation  for\n\nideological  and political  causes.   They  contend that  the\n\nIOLTA Rule  violates their First Amendment  rights of freedom\n\nof speech and association.  The district  court dismissed the\n\nplaintiffs' First  Amendment claims  on the grounds  that (1)\n\nthe IOLTA  Rule did not compel  the plaintiffs' participation\n\nin  the IOLTA program, and (2) the IOLTA Rule did not involve\n\nconstitutionally  protected  speech.     We  agree  that  the\n\nplaintiffs' First Amendment claim was properly dismissed.\n\n          The First Amendment protects the right not to speak\n\nor associate, as  well as  the right to  speak and  associate\n\nfreely.11  Roberts  v.

The Court found that compelled  financial support of\n\nthese  organizations implicates  First Amendment  rights when\n\nthe  funds were  used to  subsidize ideological  or political\n\nactivities.\n\n          In our analysis of  the plaintiffs' First Amendment\n\nclaims,  we  must  first  determine whether  the  IOLTA  Rule\n\nburdens  protected  speech  by  forcing   expression  through\n\ncompelled  support of  organizations espousing  ideologies or\n\nengaging in  political  activities.   If  so,  we  will  then\n\n                             -32-\n\nstrictly scrutinize the  IOLTA program  to determine  whether\n\nthe IOLTA  Rule  serves compelling  state  interests  through\n\nmeans which  are narrowly tailored  and germane to  the state\n\ninterests.  See Austin  v. Mich. Chamber of Commerce,  110 S.\n                                                    \n\nCt. 1391,  1396 (1990);  Pacific Gas &amp; Elec.

Is the IOLTA Rule Compulsory?\n                                      \n\n          The district court  concluded that  the IOLTA  Rule\n\nwas  not compulsory because  lawyers could avoid establishing\n\nIOLTA accounts by  choosing not  to hold client  funds or  by\n\nestablishing  individual client  accounts.   Washington Legal\n                                                             \n\nFound., 795 F. Supp. at 55.  On appeal,  the plaintiffs argue\n      \n\nthat the district court  erred in not finding the  IOLTA Rule\n\ncompulsory   as  to   them.     Interpretation  of   a  state\n\ndisciplinary rule  of professional  conduct is a  question of\n\nlaw  which we  review under  the  de novo  standard.

Keller, 496 U.S. at 10.  As alleged by\n                             \n\nthe plaintiffs,  the burden on  Tuttle and Howes  of avoiding\n\nthe  IOLTA Rule is more than an inconvenience, although it is\n\nless extreme  than forcing loss  of employment.   See Austin,\n                                                            \n\n110  S.   Ct.  at   1399  (recognizing  that   \"less  extreme\n\ndisincentives   than  the  loss   of  employment\"  can  force\n\nassociation affecting First Amendment rights).  Reviewing the\n\ndismissal of  their claims,  we take the  plaintiffs' factual\n\nallegations  as true and we draw the inference in their favor\n\nthat they cannot engage  in the full practice of  law without\n\nholding client funds which  would trigger compliance with the\n\n                    \n\n12   We express no opinion concerning whether the Real Estate\nSettlement Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C.   2601, requires lawyers\nto  use IOLTA accounts as alleged by the plaintiffs.  Because\nthe  allegation requires  a  legal conclusion,  it is  not an\nallegation of fact and  is not taken as true  for purposes of\nreviewing the dismissal of the plaintiffs' suit.\n\n                             -34-\n\nIOLTA Rule.13    Therefore, based  on the stated  assumptions\n\nand inference, the  IOLTA Rule  is compulsory as  to the  two\n\nplaintiffs  who are  lawyers  for purposes  of deciding  this\n\ncase.\n\n          A  different   question  is  presented  as  to  the\n\ncompulsory effect  of the IOLTA  Rule on  plaintiffs who  are\n\nclients.  Although  the IOLTA Rule does not directly regulate\n\nclients, its effect  is compulsory because lawyers  generally\n\ndeposit  appropriate funds from  clients into  IOLTA accounts\n\nwithout   the  knowledge   or   consent  of   their  clients.\n\n                    \n\n13  In  a dissent  urging a stiffer  penalty on a  malfeasant\nlawyer, the  following passage  was quoted to  illustrate the\nimportance of holding clients' funds in the practice of law:\n             \"Like   many   rules   governing   the\n          behavior of lawyers, [the  rule governing\n          client  funds]  has  its  roots   in  the\n          confidence and trust which  clients place\n          in  their attorneys.   Having  sought his\n          advice and relying on his  expertise, the\n          client  entrusts  the  lawyer   with  the\n          transaction including the handling of the\n          client's  funds.   Whether it  be a  real\n          estate  closing,  the establishment  of a\n          trust,  the purchase  of a  business, the\n          investment  of  funds,  the   receipt  of\n          proceeds of litigation,  or any one of  a\n          multitude  of  other  situations,  it  is\n          commonplace  that  the  work  of  lawyers\n          involves  possession  of  their  clients'\n          funds.    That  possession  is  sometimes\n          expedient, occasionally simply customary,\n          but usually essential.  Whatever the need\n          may  be  for  the  lawyer's  handling  of\n          clients'  money,  the  client permits  it\n          because he trusts the lawyer.\"\nMatter   of   Driscoll,   575   N.E.2d   46,   51-52   (Mass.\n                      \n1991)(Greaney, J., dissenting) (quoting Matter of Wilson,  81\n                                                        \nN.J. 451, 454, 409 A.2d 1153 (1979)).\n\n                             -35-\n\nTherefore,   the  IOLTA  Rule  effectively  coerces  clients'\n\ncompliance through the  practices of their lawyers.   Even if\n\nclients were informed of the IOLTA Rule and offered a choice,\n\nwe will  assume, again for the limited  purposes of reviewing\n\ndismissal of this case, that there are circumstances in which\n\nthe   use  of   IOLTA   accounts  is   necessary  for   legal\n\nrepresentation and therefore, that  clients would at times be\n\ncompelled to  allow  their funds  to  be deposited  in  IOLTA\n\naccounts.  \n\n          2.

Typically,  compelled  contribution of money\n\nto support political or ideological causes is the root of the\n\nevil which offends the First Amendment:  \"'to compel a man to\n\nfurnish  contributions  of  money   for  the  propagation  of\n\nopinions which  he disbelieves,  is sinful  and tyrannical.'\"\n\nAbood, 431  U.S.  at 234-35  n.31  (quoting I.  Brant,  James\n     \n\nMadison:  The Nationalist 354 (1948)).  In  this   case,  the\n\nplaintiffs' allegations that \"[t]he  collection of and use of\n\ninterest, under  color of  state law, generated  by funds  in\n\nIOLTA  trust accounts\"  violate  their rights  to freedom  of\n\nspeech and  association do  not  state a  claim of  compelled\n\nfinancial support.  The interest generated by funds deposited\n\nin IOLTA accounts is not the clients' money.  The  process by\n\nwhich  the  IOLTA  program  collects  and  uses  the  accrued\n\ninterest does not affect the plaintiffs' funds  held in IOLTA\n\naccounts  nor  does  it  require any  other  expenditures  or\n\nefforts  by the  plaintiffs.16   Put  simply, the  plaintiffs\n\nhave not been compelled by the IOLTA Rule to contribute their\n\nmoney  to  the IOLTA  program.    Rather, the  IOLTA  program\n\n                    \n\n16   We note that  the plaintiff-lawyers are  required by the\nIOLTA  Rule to  set up  IOLTA accounts  in banks  and deposit\nappropriate  client  funds  therein.    Because a  comparable\neffort  would be  necessary  to set  up non-interest  bearing\naccounts  for  the  deposit  of  client  funds,  we  find  it\ninconsequential for First Amendment analysis.\n\n                             -39-\n\nrecipient organizations benefit  from an  anomaly created  by\n\nthe practicalities of accounting, banking practices,  and the\n\nethical obligation of lawyers.   The interest earned on IOLTA\n\naccounts belongs to  no one,  but has been  assigned, by  the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, to be used by the IOLTA\n\nprogram.   Therefore, the collection and  use of the interest\n\nby the IOLTA program does not constitute financial support by\n\nthe  plaintiffs, as they  claim.   If the  plaintiffs believe\n\nthat the IOLTA  program is  not operated in  accord with  its\n\nstated  purpose  or  if  they remain  dissatisfied  with  the\n\nassigned recipients of  IOLTA funds, they may   address their\n\ncomplaints  to  the  IOLTA  Committee  or  the  Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court.\n\n          The plaintiffs  have not  alleged and there  are no\n\nother facts  or circumstances which establish  that they have\n\nbeen compelled to associate with or support the IOLTA program\n\nin any other  manner.  They  have not  been compelled by  the\n\nIOLTA Rule to join,  affirm, support or subsidize ideological\n\nexpression  of IOLTA  recipient organizations  in  any way.17\n\n                    \n\n17  Although the plaintiffs have alleged deprivation of their\nright to  freedom of  association, we  have found no  factual\nallegations  to support their claim.  The IOLTA Rule does not\nrequire that clients or lawyers  join any organization.   The\nplaintiffs  have  not alleged  that  the organizations  which\nultimately receive  IOLTA funding automatically  include them\nas  members  or  otherwise  link them  to  the  organizations\nwithout  their  consent.

Having found\n\nno impact on the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights caused by\n\nthe IOLTA  Rule,  we  need  not consider  whether  the  IOLTA\n\nprogram  serves a  compelling state  interest.

Attorneys could elect to  participate by establishing\n\nan interest-bearing IOLTA account and by complying with DR 9-\n\n102(C)  requirements  which  included  choosing  a  recipient\n\ncharity from a group designated by the IOLTA Committee. \n\n          In  1989, the Massachusetts  Supreme Judicial Court\n\n(\"SJC\")  converted   the  voluntary  IOLTA  program   into  a\n\nmandatory  program  by  amending the  IOLTA  Rule,  effective\n\nJanuary  1,  1990.    As  amended,  the   rule  required  all\n\nMassachusetts  lawyers to deposit  client funds into interest\n\nbearing accounts:  either  (1) a pooled IOLTA account  if, in\n\nthe  judgment of  the lawyer,  the  deposits were  nominal in\n\namount or to  be held for only a short period of time; or (2)\n\nindividual  accounts for  all other client  funds.   The Rule\n\nrequired lawyers  or law  firms to  direct the  banks holding\n\ntheir  IOLTA  accounts  to  disburse accrued  interest  to  a\n\ncharitable entity selected by the lawyer or firm from a group\n\ndesignated  by  the  SJC.    The  designated  charities  were\n\nMassachusetts   Legal   Assistance,  the   Massachusetts  Bar\n\nFoundation, and the Boston Bar Foundation.\n\n          The  SJC again  amended the  IOLTA Rule,  effective\n\nJanuary 1,  1993, to change  the process for  disbursement of\n\nIOLTA funds.2   The IOLTA Rule  now vests responsibility  for\n\n                    \n\n2    The  Massachusetts Supreme  Judicial Court  amended Rule\n3:07, DR 9-102(C) by Order 92-18,  effective January 1, 1993.\nA copy  of DR 9-102 and the  amendment appear in the appendix\nfollowing this opinion.\n\n                             -6-\n\ndisbursement  of  IOLTA  funds  in the  IOLTA  Committee  and\n\neliminates choice by lawyers of recipient eligible charities.\n\nThe IOLTA Committee must  disburse sixty-seven percent of all\n\nIOLTA   funds  to  Massachusetts  Legal  Assistance  and  the\n\nremaining   thirty-three   percent   to   \"other   designated\n\ncharitable entities.\"\n\n          The parties  have not briefed or  argued any issues\n\nin  the context  of the  1993 amendment  to the  IOLTA Rule.3\n\nAlthough the  amendment of the IOLTA Rule affects the process\n\nof funds disbursement, the  changes are not material  to this\n\ndecision.   None  of the  parties  argued that  the  lawyers'\n\nchoice  of  recipient  charities,  as provided  by  the  1990\n\nversion  of the IOLTA Rule,  was significant.   The funds are\n\nstill  disbursed primarily to  Massachusetts Legal Assistance\n\nwith the remainder  to \"other designated eligible  charities\"\n\nwhich  are still  the  Massachusetts Bar  Foundation and  the\n\nBoston  Bar Foundation.   In addition,  the mission  of IOLTA\n\nfunds remains the same:   \"The Massachusetts Legal Assistance\n\nCorporation  may use  IOLTA  funds to  further its  corporate\n\npurpose and  other designated  charitable entitles  [sic] may\n\nuse IOLTA  funds either for (1)  improving the administration\n\nof justice or  (2) delivering civil  legal services to  those\n\nwho  cannot afford them.\"   Mass.

The plaintiffs  allege, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\n   1983, that they have  been deprived, under  color of state\n\nlaw,  of  their  rights  secured  by  the  First,  Fifth  and\n\nFourteenth Amendments of the Constitution by operation of the\n\nMassachusetts IOLTA program.  1.    Count  One:    First  and\n                                                             \n\nFourteenth Amendments\n                     \n\n          WLF alleges that it sent a check to cover costs and\n\nexpenses  related to  this  legal action  to a  Massachusetts\n\nattorney  (not a party to the action) who deposited the check\n\nin his IOLTA  account as required by the IOLTA  Rule.  Parker\n\nalleges  that she  has and  will continue  to use  lawyers in\n\nconnection  with her real estate business  and that her funds\n\n                             -9-\n\ndeposited with lawyers  have and will  be deposited in  IOLTA\n\naccounts.  WLF and Parker allege that:\n\n            The collection of  and use of interest,\n          under color of state law,  generated from\n          the   IOLTA   trust  account   of  [their\n          attorneys] for litigation, especially for\n          litigation  that  involves  political  or\n          ideological  causes, and  for legislative\n          or  other  forms  of   lobbying,  deprive\n          [them]  of  their  rights  to  freedom of\n          speech and association guaranteed  by the\n          First  and  Fourteenth Amendments  to the\n          U.S. Constitution. \n\n          Davis  alleges that  although she  has not  yet had\n\nmoney deposited in an IOLTA, the IOLTA Rule creates \"the risk\n\nthat  she  will be  forced  to  choose  between employing  an\n\nattorney or  financially supporting organizations  with which\n\nshe disagrees.\"   Davis alleges her constitutional claims  in\n\nsubstantially similar terms to  those quoted above.  Attorney\n\nHowes alleges that he has had to deposit client funds  in his\n\nIOLTA as required by the IOLTA Rule and that the Rule \"forces\n\n[him] to  choose  between not  practicing  law and  or  [sic]\n\npracticing  law  and  associating  with  organizations  whose\n\nactions  offend  his  political and  ideological  beliefs and\n\nthereby depriving him of  his right to freedom of  speech and\n\nassociation  as  guaranteed  by   the  First  and  Fourteenth\n\nAmendments  to  the U.S.  Constitution.\"    Finally, Attorney\n\nTuttle alleges that the IOLTA Rule has forced him \"to forego,\n\nto  his  professional  and  financial  detriment,  depositing\n\ncertain  client funds  into non-interest bearing  accounts in\n\n                             -10-\n\norder to avoid  associating with organizations whose  actions\n\noffend   his  political  and   ideological  beliefs\"  thereby\n\ndepriving him of the same constitutional rights as alleged by\n\nAttorney Howes.  \n\n          In  summary,  Count  I  alleges  violation  of  the\n\nplaintiffs' rights of freedom of speech and association.\n\n                             -11-\n\n     2.  Count Two:  Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\n                                                    \n\n          Plaintiffs WLF  and  Parker allege  that the  IOLTA\n\nRule constitutes an  illegal taking of the  beneficial use of\n\ntheir  funds for  public  use without  just compensation  and\n\nwithout  due process  of law  in violation  of the  Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments to the  Constitution.4  Howes makes the\n\nsame  claim on  behalf  of his  clients  whose funds  he  has\n\ndeposited into his IOLTA account.   Neither Davis, Howes  (on\n\nhis own behalf) nor Tuttle make claims under Count II. \n\n     3.  Relief Requested\n                         \n\n          The  plaintiffs ask for  declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief  to dismantle  the  operation of  the mandatory  IOLTA\n\nprogram.    Specifically,  the plaintiffs  request  that  the\n\ncourt:  (1) require  the  defendants to  refund the  interest\n\nwhich has been earned on their funds while in IOLTA accounts;\n\n(2)  declare  the  IOLTA  Rule void  as  an  unconstitutional\n\nviolation  of the  plaintiffs'  First, Fifth  and  Fourteenth\n\n                    \n\n4    The plaintiffs have not  pursued their claims alleged in\nCount III based  on the Fourteenth  Amendment that the  IOLTA\nprogram  has   unconstitutionally  deprived  them   of  their\nproperty  without  due  process  of  law.    The  plaintiffs'\nstatement   of   issues  on   appeal   is   limited  to   the\nconstitutional rights  of the plaintiffs under  the First and\nFifth Amendments.  Therefore,  we assume that the plaintiffs'\nclaims under the Fourteenth Amendment have been abandoned and\nare waived.  United  States v.

Dismissal of Claims\n                       \n\n          The  defendants  moved to  dismiss  the plaintiffs'\n\naction on the grounds that their constitutional claims lacked\n\nmerit  and that some of the plaintiffs lacked standing.5  The\n\ndistrict court found that  there was no serious  dispute that\n\nat least  two  of  the  plaintiffs,  Parker  and  Howes,  had\n\nstanding to bring their  constitutional claims.  The district\n\ncourt  dismissed the  plaintiffs'  claims  holding \"that  the\n\nplaintiffs have no property interest  in the funds subject to\n\n                    \n\n5   On appeal, the  record includes only the defendants' bare\nmotion to dismiss which states the grounds as lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction and  failure to state a  claim upon which\nrelief  may be granted.   The  district court  summarized the\ndefendants' grounds  for the motion to  dismiss: \"In addition\nto arguing that the plaintiffs' constitutional challenges are\nwithout  merit, the  defendants contend  that  two plaintiffs\nlack standing.\"  Washington Legal Found., 795 F. Supp. at 52,\n                                        \nn.3.  We assume, therefore, that the defendants' assertion of\nlack  of  subject matter  jurisdiction  referred  to lack  of\nstanding.   \n\n                             -13-\n\nthe  SJC  Rule,\"  and  that  the  SJC  Rule  did  not  compel\n\nassociation  with speech and  \"speech, in  the constitutional\n\nsense,  is  not  a  factor   of  the  challenged  SJC  Rule.\"\n\nWashington  Legal Found., 795 F.

Warth, 422 U.S. at 500.\n                         \n\n          The district  court found  that at least  Howes and\n\nParker had standing to bring the constitutional challenges in\n\nthis  case.   Karen  Parker alleges  that  she has  and  will\n\ncontinue to  employ lawyers  for transactions related  to her\n\nbusiness  and that she has and  will have her funds placed in\n\nIOLTA accounts by the  lawyers she employs.  She  claims that\n\nthe  IOLTA  program  collects  and  uses  for  political  and\n\n                             -16-\n\nideological causes interest generated  by her funds placed in\n\nIOLTA  accounts, and  therefore  the operation  of the  IOLTA\n\nprogram deprives her of freedom  of speech and association in\n\nviolation of the  First Amendment.   Parker also claims  that\n\nthe  IOLTA  program  constitutes  an illegal  taking  of  the\n\nbeneficial use  of her funds  deposited in IOLTA  accounts in\n\nviolation of the  Fifth Amendment.   She asks  this court  to\n\ndeclare  the IOLTA  Rule unconstitutional  and to  enjoin the\n\noperation  of the rule.  Based upon her allegations, which we\n\ntake  as  true for  this purpose,  she  has stated  an actual\n\ninjury  to herself which is  traceable to the  IOLTA rule and\n\nwhich may  be remedied by  the relief sought.   We agree with\n\nthe district  court that Parker has standing  to maintain her\n\nclaims made in this action.\n\n          Howes presents  a more complex  standing situation.\n\nHowes  brings the First Amendment claim on his own behalf and\n\non  behalf of his clients, and the Fifth Amendment claim only\n\non behalf of  his clients.6  As to  the First Amendment claim\n\n                    \n\n6     Howes'  standing on  behalf  of third  parties  is more\ndifficult.

Another Florida\n\n                             -26-\n\nstatute provided for a separate fee to be paid  to the county\n\nregistry  for holding  interpleaded funds.   The  Court first\n\ndetermined  that claimants  of the  interpleaded funds  had a\n\nproperty right to the  deposited funds.  Webb's, 449  U.S. at\n                                               \n\n161-62.  Applying the general  rule that interest follows the\n\nprincipal,  the Court held that the  claimants had a property\n\nright to the interest accrued on the interpleaded funds.  Id.\n                                                             \n\nThe   Court   concluded  that   there   was   not  sufficient\n\njustification  for  the  county   to  take  the  interest  on\n\ninterpleaded  funds, which  was the  private property  of the\n\nclaimants, when the county registries were receiving fees for\n\nthe  costs related to holding the interpleaded funds.  Id. at\n                                                          \n\n164-65.    \n\n          Despite the some  superficial similarities  between\n\nWebb's  and this case, there is a fundamental difference.  In\n      \n\nWebb's,   the  Court   found  that   the  claimants   to  the\n      \n\ninterpleaded  fund had  a  recognized property  right to  the\n\ninterest  earned while  the  funds were  held  by the  county\n\nregistries.    In this  case, the  plaintiffs  do not  have a\n\nproperty  right to the interest earned on their funds held in\n\nIOLTA  accounts.  See Cone, 819 F.2d at 1006-07 (holding that\n                          \n\nplaintiffs had no right to interest earned on IOLTA  accounts\n\nand  discussing  implications  of  Webb's).    In  fact,  the\n                                         \n\nplaintiffs  recognize  this  and  claim  only  the intangible\n\nrights related to the beneficial use of deposited funds:  the\n\n                             -27-\n\nright  to control and exclude others.  The property rights of\n\nthe plaintiffs  here and the claimants  in Webb's, therefore,\n                                                 \n\nare different.   The Webb's claimants had  property rights to\n                           \n\naccrued interest which  is tangible personal  property, while\n\nplaintiffs in this case have claimed only intangible property\n\ninterests.\n\n          The  IOLTA program  does not  occupy or  invade the\n\nplaintiffs'  property  even temporarily:   the  IOLTA program\n\nleaves the  deposited funds  untouched, the funds  are always\n\navailable to clients as  required by DR 9-102(B)(4),  and the\n\ninterest  earned on  IOLTA  accounts is  not the  plaintiffs'\n\nproperty.  The property rights  claimed by the plaintiffs are\n\nintangible.   We  find no  logical or  legal support  for the\n\nplaintiffs'  claim  that  the  IOLTA  program  has  caused  a\n\nphysical invasion and occupation of their intangible property\n\nrights.             b.  Economic interference.\n                                              \n\n          Governmental  action through regulation  of the use\n\nof  private  property  does not  cause  a  taking  unless the\n\ninterference  is significant.    Andrus, 444  U.S. at  66-67.\n                                       \n\nHaving  found  no weight  to  the  plaintiffs' argument  that\n\ngovernmental  action through  the IOLTA  Rule has  effected a\n\nphysical invasion  of their property rights,  we consider the\n\neconomic factors which are significant to a takings claim the\n\neconomic  impact of  the  IOLTA Rule  on the  plaintiffs, and\n\n\"'the  extent to  which  the regulation  has interfered  with\n\n                             -28-\n\ndistinct  investment-backed  expectations.'\"   Connolly,  475\n                                                       \n\nU.S. at 225 (citations omitted).\n\n          The property  rights claimed by  the plaintiffs  do\n\nnot involve  clients' economic interests.   The claimed right\n\nto control and to  exclude others from the beneficial  use of\n\nfunds  held  by  lawyers  has  no  economic  benefit for  the\n\nplaintiffs because clients would not otherwise be entitled to\n\nthe  interest earned on  pooled accounts.   Plaintiffs do not\n\nclaim  and there are  no \"investment-backed\"  expectations in\n\nthe claimed rights of  clients to control and  exclude others\n\nfrom  the  beneficial  use  of deposited  funds  under  these\n\ncircumstances.  \n\n          In  sum,  the plaintiffs  claim,  at  best, a  thin\n\nstrand in the commonly  recognized bundle of property rights.\n\nUnder  the IOLTA  Rule,  the plaintiffs  retain the  right to\n\npossess, use and  dispose of the  principal sum deposited  in\n\nIOLTA  accounts.  \"At least  where an owner  possesses a full\n\n'bundle' of property rights,  the destruction of one 'strand'\n\nof the bundle is  not a taking, because the aggregate must be\n\nviewed  in  its  entirety.\"    Andrus,  444  U.S.  at  65-66.\n                                     \n\nWeighing the plaintiffs' claimed  property rights against the\n\nbundle  of rights  remaining  in their  deposited funds  left\n\nuntouched by the IOLTA  program, we find that the  IOLTA Rule\n\nhas   not   caused   a   taking   of   plaintiff's  property.\n\n                             -29-\n\nConsequently, we need not  weigh any burden caused  by taking\n\nprivate rights against the public benefit.\n\n          We  affirm,   albeit  on  different   grounds,  the\n\ndistrict court's  dismissal of  Count Two of  the plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint.\n\nB. The First Amendment Speech and Association Claim\n                                                   \n\n          The  plaintiffs claim  that the IOLTA  Rule compels\n\nlawyers, and  therefore clients, to participate  in the IOLTA\n\nprogram  and  thereby  support lobbying  and  litigation  for\n\nideological  and political  causes.   They  contend that  the\n\nIOLTA Rule  violates their First Amendment  rights of freedom\n\nof speech and association.  The district  court dismissed the\n\nplaintiffs' First  Amendment claims  on the grounds  that (1)\n\nthe IOLTA  Rule did not compel  the plaintiffs' participation\n\nin  the IOLTA program, and (2) the IOLTA Rule did not involve\n\nconstitutionally  protected  speech.     We  agree  that  the\n\nplaintiffs' First Amendment claim was properly dismissed.\n\n          The First Amendment protects the right not to speak\n\nor associate, as  well as  the right to  speak and  associate\n\nfreely.11  Roberts  v.

AVX Corp., 962 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n115.\n\n          The IOLTA Rule obligates lawyers to deposit  client\n\nfunds which they hold  for short terms or in  minimal amounts\n\n                             -33-\n\ninto IOLTA accounts.  The plaintiffs allege facts which, when\n\ntaken as  true, establish  that avoiding the  IOLTA Rule  has\n\nsignificantly limited  Attorney Tuttle's practice  of law and\n\nnegatively  affected  his   livelihood.12    Attorney   Howes\n\nalleges that he  has had to comply with IOLTA to maintain his\n\npractice of  law  despite  his  belief that  the  IOLTA  Rule\n\ncompels him to  support politics and ideologies with which he\n\ndisagrees. \n\n          Claimants cannot  be required by  government action\n\nto  relinquish  First  Amendment  rights as  a  condition  of\n\nretaining employment.  Keller, 496 U.S. at 10.  As alleged by\n                             \n\nthe plaintiffs,  the burden on  Tuttle and Howes  of avoiding\n\nthe  IOLTA Rule is more than an inconvenience, although it is\n\nless extreme  than forcing loss  of employment.   See Austin,\n                                                            \n\n110  S.   Ct.  at   1399  (recognizing  that   \"less  extreme\n\ndisincentives   than  the  loss   of  employment\"  can  force\n\nassociation affecting First Amendment rights).  Reviewing the\n\ndismissal of  their claims,  we take the  plaintiffs' factual\n\nallegations  as true and we draw the inference in their favor\n\nthat they cannot engage  in the full practice of  law without\n\nholding client funds which  would trigger compliance with the\n\n                    \n\n12   We express no opinion concerning whether the Real Estate\nSettlement Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C.   2601, requires lawyers\nto  use IOLTA accounts as alleged by the plaintiffs.  Because\nthe  allegation requires  a  legal conclusion,  it is  not an\nallegation of fact and  is not taken as true  for purposes of\nreviewing the dismissal of the plaintiffs' suit.\n\n                             -34-\n\nIOLTA Rule.13    Therefore, based  on the stated  assumptions\n\nand inference, the  IOLTA Rule  is compulsory as  to the  two\n\nplaintiffs  who are  lawyers  for purposes  of deciding  this\n\ncase.\n\n          A  different   question  is  presented  as  to  the\n\ncompulsory effect  of the IOLTA  Rule on  plaintiffs who  are\n\nclients.  Although  the IOLTA Rule does not directly regulate\n\nclients, its effect  is compulsory because lawyers  generally\n\ndeposit  appropriate funds from  clients into  IOLTA accounts\n\nwithout   the  knowledge   or   consent  of   their  clients.\n\n                    \n\n13  In  a dissent  urging a stiffer  penalty on a  malfeasant\nlawyer, the  following passage  was quoted to  illustrate the\nimportance of holding clients' funds in the practice of law:\n             \"Like   many   rules   governing   the\n          behavior of lawyers, [the  rule governing\n          client  funds]  has  its  roots   in  the\n          confidence and trust which  clients place\n          in  their attorneys.   Having  sought his\n          advice and relying on his  expertise, the\n          client  entrusts  the  lawyer   with  the\n          transaction including the handling of the\n          client's  funds.   Whether it  be a  real\n          estate  closing,  the establishment  of a\n          trust,  the purchase  of a  business, the\n          investment  of  funds,  the   receipt  of\n          proceeds of litigation,  or any one of  a\n          multitude  of  other  situations,  it  is\n          commonplace  that  the  work  of  lawyers\n          involves  possession  of  their  clients'\n          funds.    That  possession  is  sometimes\n          expedient, occasionally simply customary,\n          but usually essential.  Whatever the need\n          may  be  for  the  lawyer's  handling  of\n          clients'  money,  the  client permits  it\n          because he trusts the lawyer.\"\nMatter   of   Driscoll,   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>   <span class=\"page\">46</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   51-52   (Mass.\n                      \n1991)(Greaney, J., dissenting) (quoting Matter of Wilson,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1974545\"><a href=\"/opinion/1974545/in-re-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span>\n                                                        \n<span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1974545\"><a href=\"/opinion/1974545/in-re-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979)).\n\n                             -35-\n\nTherefore,   the  IOLTA  Rule  effectively  coerces  clients'\n\ncompliance through the  practices of their lawyers.

Typically,  compelled  contribution of money\n\nto support political or ideological causes is the root of the\n\nevil which offends the First Amendment:  \"'to compel a man to\n\nfurnish  contributions  of  money   for  the  propagation  of\n\nopinions which  he disbelieves,  is sinful  and tyrannical.'\"\n\nAbood, 431  U.S.  at 234-35  n.31  (quoting I.  Brant,  James\n     \n\nMadison:  The Nationalist 354 (1948)).  In  this   case,  the\n\nplaintiffs' allegations that \"[t]he  collection of and use of\n\ninterest, under  color of  state law, generated  by funds  in\n\nIOLTA  trust accounts\"  violate  their rights  to freedom  of\n\nspeech and  association do  not  state a  claim of  compelled\n\nfinancial support.  The interest generated by funds deposited\n\nin IOLTA accounts is not the clients' money.  The  process by\n\nwhich  the  IOLTA  program  collects  and  uses  the  accrued\n\ninterest does not affect the plaintiffs' funds  held in IOLTA\n\naccounts  nor  does  it  require any  other  expenditures  or\n\nefforts  by the  plaintiffs.16   Put  simply, the  plaintiffs\n\nhave not been compelled by the IOLTA Rule to contribute their\n\nmoney  to  the IOLTA  program.    Rather, the  IOLTA  program\n\n                    \n\n16   We note that  the plaintiff-lawyers are  required by the\nIOLTA  Rule to  set up  IOLTA accounts  in banks  and deposit\nappropriate  client  funds  therein.    Because a  comparable\neffort  would be  necessary  to set  up non-interest  bearing\naccounts  for  the  deposit  of  client  funds,  we  find  it\ninconsequential for First Amendment analysis.\n\n                             -39-\n\nrecipient organizations benefit  from an  anomaly created  by\n\nthe practicalities of accounting, banking practices,  and the\n\nethical obligation of lawyers.   The interest earned on IOLTA\n\naccounts belongs to  no one,  but has been  assigned, by  the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, to be used by the IOLTA\n\nprogram.   Therefore, the collection and  use of the interest\n\nby the IOLTA program does not constitute financial support by\n\nthe  plaintiffs, as they  claim.   If the  plaintiffs believe\n\nthat the IOLTA  program is  not operated in  accord with  its\n\nstated  purpose  or  if  they remain  dissatisfied  with  the\n\nassigned recipients of  IOLTA funds, they may   address their\n\ncomplaints  to  the  IOLTA  Committee  or  the  Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court.\n\n          The plaintiffs  have not  alleged and there  are no\n\nother facts  or circumstances which establish  that they have\n\nbeen compelled to associate with or support the IOLTA program\n\nin any other  manner.  They  have not  been compelled by  the\n\nIOLTA Rule to join,  affirm, support or subsidize ideological\n\nexpression  of IOLTA  recipient organizations  in  any way.17\n\n                    \n\n17  Although the plaintiffs have alleged deprivation of their\nright to  freedom of  association, we  have found no  factual\nallegations  to support their claim.  The IOLTA Rule does not\nrequire that clients or lawyers  join any organization.   The\nplaintiffs  have  not alleged  that  the organizations  which\nultimately receive  IOLTA funding automatically  include them\nas  members  or  otherwise  link them  to  the  organizations\nwithout  their  consent.
