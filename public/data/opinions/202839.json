In this appeal, Plaintiff Emory\n\nZipperer seeks reversal of the district court's grant of judgment\n\non the pleadings in favor of his former employer, Raytheon Company,\n\nInc. (\"Raytheon\").          Zipperer asserted Massachusetts state law\n\nclaims     of    negligence,        equitable    estoppel        and       negligent\n\nmisrepresentation against Raytheon after Raytheon provided him with\n\nan erroneous estimate of his retirement benefits which, he claims,\n\nled   to   his   voluntary    early   retirement.       The   district       court,\n\nessentially       adopting      a     magistrate       judge's     report        and\n\nrecommendation, ruled that Zipperer's claims are preempted by the\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 1001\n\net seq.    We affirm.\n\n                             I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n            We state the facts as pleaded in the complaint.                      See\n\nMass. Nurses Ass'n v. N. Adams State Reg'l Hosp., 467 F.3d 27, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).        In November 1972, Zipperer began working for\n\nUnited     Engineers    &    Constructors,      Inc.    (\"UEC\"),       a    Raytheon\n\nsubsidiary, as a field engineer in UEC's nuclear power division.\n\nZipperer began participating in the UEC retirement plan in January\n\n1975.\n\n            At Raytheon's request, in November 1990 Zipperer began\n\nworking for another Raytheon subsidiary, Raytheon Services, Nevada\n\n(\"RSN\"), a specialty company used by Raytheon solely for the\n\npurpose of administering work for the United States Department of\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fEnergy (\"DOE\"). While working at RSN, Zipperer remained a Raytheon\n\nemployee, and no funds were transferred from the UEC retirement\n\nplan to the RSN pension plan.               However, the Raytheon Benefit\n\nCenter, which administered both plans, adjusted Zipperer's service\n\ndate for the RSN plan to reflect his previous service at UEC.\n\n           Zipperer's employment at RSN ended in October 1993.             The\n\nnext   month,   Zipperer     began   working    for   Raytheon   Engineers    &\n\nConstructors, (\"REC\"), a successor to UEC.                Upon his hiring,\n\nalthough no trust funds were transferred, REC credited Zipperer for\n\nhis prior years of service with UEC for purposes of calculating his\n\npension benefits.       As with the Raytheon-affiliated UEC and RSN\n\nplans, the REC benefit plan was also administered by the Raytheon\n\nBenefit Center.      On December 30, 1995, according to the Raytheon\n\nBenefit Center, RSN's pension trust funds were transferred to the\n\nBechtel   Nevada    Employee      Retirement   Plan   when    Bechtel   Nevada\n\nreplaced RSN as a DOE contractor.                 Neither Raytheon nor RSN\n\nnotified Zipperer's then-current employer, REC, that the RSN trust\n\nfund monies attributable to Zipperer's vested RSN benefit, which\n\nalso included his prior service at UEC, had been transferred to\n\nBechtel. None of the Raytheon pension plans was amended to reflect\n\nthe transfer.      Thus, when REC was purchased by Washington Group\n\nInternational      (\"WGI\")   in    July   2000,    Raytheon   calculated     an\n\noverstated benefit amount attributable to Zipperer, erroneously\n\nincluding amounts attributable to his original UEC service, which\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fhad already been subsumed into the RSN plan eventually transferred\n\nto Bechtel.    In other words, both Bechtel and Raytheon were\n\nincluding Zipperer's original UEC service time in their respective\n\npension calculations.\n\n          In late 1999, at age 55, Zipperer requested from REC an\n\nestimate of his pension benefit, noting his prior service with UEC\n\nand \"Raytheon Company(s).\"    According to the benefit computation\n\nsubsequently provided to him by REC, Zipperer could expect to\n\nreceive a monthly benefit of $1,100.17 if he chose a single life\n\nannuity with no right of survivorship, $1,063.11 if he chose a ten\n\nyear \"certain and continuous option,\" and $980.55 if he chose a\n\njoint and survivor annuity.   Basing their decision on the benefit\n\nestimate provided by Raytheon, Zipperer and his wife decided to\n\nretire, shortly after the sale of REC to WGI.   At the time of his\n\nretirement, in September 2000, Zipperer was 56 years old and was\n\nearning $107,484 annually as a Project Control Manager.\n\n          Zipperer, who chose the joint and survivor annuity,\n\nsubsequently began receiving monthly pension payments from Raytheon\n\nof $840.64, approximately $140 less than the previous estimate. In\n\nJune 2001, the Raytheon Benefit Center advised Zipperer in writing\n\nthat his pension benefits had been overstated and that he was\n\nentitled to a monthly benefit of only $400.06.       Zipperer, who\n\nconcedes that he is currently receiving a pension from Bechtel, the\n\namount of which takes into consideration his service time at RSN\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fand UEC, was unsuccessful in his internal appeals of the benefit\n\ndetermination.      After exhausting the internal appeals process,\n\nZipperer   filed    a   complaint    against   Raytheon   in   Massachusetts\n\nSuperior    Court   alleging    negligence,      equitable     estoppel   and\n\nnegligent misrepresentation.         Raytheon timely    removed the case to\n\nfederal court, and subsequently moved for judgment on the pleadings\n\non the ground that Zipperer's claims were preempted by ERISA.\n\nAfter a hearing, a magistrate judge recommended allowing the\n\nmotion.    The magistrate judge concluded that:\n\n            Allowing a cause of action to proceed for the\n            negligence in making the representation or the\n            negligence in maintaining and transferring the\n            pertinent records amounts to an alternative\n            enforcement mechanism to enforce (or estop the\n            employer   from   denying)   extra-contractual\n            benefits. Such claims inevitably and directly\n            conflict with the carefully chosen and\n            carefully limited remedies provided under\n            ERISA . . . . Regardless of the label of the\n            state law claims, in essence they seek extra-\n            contractual benefits not authorized by the\n            terms of the Plan. Such an end run around the\n            carefully crafted benefits Raytheon chose to\n            provide amounts to an attempt to authorize\n            remedies beyond those provided by the Plan.\n\n\nReport and Recommendation at 10.\n\n            Zipperer      objected      to     the     magistrate    judge's\n\nrecommendation, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 72, but the district court\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fadopted the recommendations in all material respects.1 This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                II.   DISCUSSION\n\n             We review de novo the district court's grant of judgment\n\non the pleadings.      Mass. Nurses Ass'n, 467 F.3d at 31.          We view the\n\nfacts contained in the pleadings in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. Aponte-\n\nTorres v. Univ. of P.R., 445 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir. 2006).             Judgment\n\non the pleadings is proper \"only if the uncontested and properly\n\nconsidered facts conclusively establish the movant's entitlement to\n\na favorable judgment.        Id.\n\n             Zipperer advances several theories on appeal.           First, he\n\nargues that his claims do not relate to Raytheon's retirement plan,\n\nand    do   not   duplicate,    supplement    or   supplant    ERISA's    civil\n\nenforcement provisions.        Instead, he says, his claims relate only\n\nto    Raytheon's    \"independent      legal   obligation\"     to   keep   proper\n\nrecords.     He further argues that his claims do not relate to the\n\nretirement plan, because he is seeking only negligence damages and\n\nnot    reinstatement    of     promised   benefits.     Finally,      Zipperer\n\nmaintains that even if preemption would otherwise be appropriate,\n\nthe district court erroneously concluded that Raytheon was acting\n\nas \"an ERISA employer\" during the relevant time period.\n\n\n1\n Both the magistrate judge and the district court provided Zipperer\nwith opportunities to amend his Complaint.      He did not accept\neither invitation.\n\n                                       -6-\n\f              Our analysis begins with § 514 of ERISA, which provides\n\nthat ERISA preempts \"any and all State laws insofar as they may now\n\nor hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan . . . .\"2                  29\n\nU.S.C. § 1144(a).          \"The term 'State law' includes all laws,\n\ndecisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the\n\neffect of law, of any State.\"          29 U.S.C. § 1144(c)(1).         A law\n\n\"relates to\" an employee benefit plan \"if it has a connection with\n\nor reference to such a plan.\" Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498\n\nU.S. 133, 139 (1990) (quoting Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463\n\nU.S. 85, 96-97 (1983)).      A state law can be considered \"related to\"\n\na   benefit    plan--and   thus   preempted--\"even   if   the   law   is   not\n\nspecifically designed to affect such plans, or the effect is only\n\nindirect.\" Id. (quoting Pilot Life Insurance Co. v. Dedeaux, 481\n\nU.S. 41, 47 (1987)).\n\n              While ERISA's preemption is not boundless, it is far\n\nreaching.       In determining the reach of ERISA preemption, the\n\nSupreme Court has cautioned against a literal reading of ERISA\n\n§514(a)'s \"relate to\" standard, and ruled that courts must \"'look\n\ninstead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the\n\nscope of the state law that Congress understood would survive.'\"\n\nHampers v. W.R. Grace & Co., 202 F.3d 44, 51 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(quoting N.Y. State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v.\n\n\n\n2\n There is no dispute that the Plan at issue in this case is an\n\"employee benefit plan,\" within the meaning of ERISA.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fTravelers Ins. Co., 514 U.S. 645, 656 (1995)).             ERISA's objectives\n\ninclude providing a \"uniform national administration of ERISA\n\nplans\" and avoiding inconsistent state regulation of such plans.\n\nDanca v. Private Health Care Sys., Inc.,185 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (citing Travelers, 514 U.S. at 656-58).              Three categories of\n\nstate regulation that have been identified as conflicting with\n\nthese objectives are: 1) those that mandate employee benefit\n\nstructures    or   their    administration;      2)   those      that   bind   plan\n\nadministrators to a particular choice; and 3) causes of action that\n\nprovide     alternative      enforcement      mechanisms        to   ERISA's   own\n\nenforcement scheme.        Travelers, 514 U.S. at 658-59; Hampers, 202\n\nF.3d at 44.    Looking to the real nature of the plaintiff's claims,\n\nregardless    of   how     they   are   characterized      in    his    complaint,\n\nHampers, 202 F.3d at 51, we conclude that the first and third\n\ncategories of conflicting state regulation are implicated here.\n\n            As mentioned, Zipperer first argues that his suit does\n\nnot relate to Raytheon's retirement plan, and does not duplicate,\n\nsupplement or supplant ERISA's civil enforcement provisions.                    We\n\ndisagree.     The complaint's three counts rely on the common claim\n\nthat Raytheon's negligent recordkeeping led to his reliance on an\n\nerroneous estimate of his retirement benefits.                In our view, even\n\na narrow reading of section 514(a)'s \"related to\" provision yields\n\na conclusion that Zipperer's claims are preempted, and that is\n\nbecause the claims can only be evaluated with respect to Raytheon's\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\frecordkeeping responsibilities for the plan. Such responsibilities\n\nwere part and parcel of Raytheon's plan administration. Subjecting\n\nRaytheon's plan administration to the state law scrutiny Zipperer\n\nseeks would conflict with ERISA's proscription against state law\n\n\"mandat[ing] plan administration\" and would also impermissibly\n\ncreate     \"an    alternative      enforcement      scheme\"    to     ERISA's       own\n\nrecordkeeping and reporting requirements.              Travelers, 514 U.S. at\n\n658-59; Hampers, 202 F.3d at 51.              Moreover, allowing a claim to\n\nproceed      under      Massachusetts         law     would         inexorably--and\n\nimpermissibly--lead to inconsistent state regulations, as state\n\ncourts \"develop different substantive standards applicable to the\n\nsame   employer      conduct,   requiring     the    tailoring       of    plans    and\n\nemployer    conduct     to   the    peculiarities      of     the    law    of     each\n\njurisdiction.        Such an outcome is fundamentally at odds\" with\n\nERISA's goal of uniformity.          McClendon, 489 U.S. at 142.\n\n            If we had any doubt about whether Zipperer's claims are\n\npreempted, we note that we faced a nearly identical situation in\n\nCarlo v. Reed Rolled Thread Die Co., 49 F.3d 790 (1st Cir 1995).\n\nThere, the plaintiff filed state law misrepresentation claims\n\nagainst his employer after he accepted an early retirement offer\n\nwhich, it turns out, was based on inaccurate information provided\n\nby the employer. Id. at 792.            We affirmed the dismissal of the\n\ncomplaint    on    preemption      grounds,   noting    that    an     analysis      of\n\nplaintiff's claims would \"ultimately depend on an analysis\" of the\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fERISA plan at issue, to which the claims were thus \"inseparably\n\nconnected.\"      Id.   at   795.        Similarly,      Zipperer's         claims    are\n\n\"inseparably     connected\"        to     the       Raytheon       plan      and     its\n\nadministration. See also Degnan v. Publicker Indus., Inc., 83 F.3d\n\n27 (1st Cir. 1996) (affirming dismissal, on preemption grounds, of\n\nplaintiff's state law misrepresentation claims against a former\n\nemployer   who   allegedly    reneged          on   certain       promises    it    made\n\nregarding plaintiff's retirement benefits).\n\n           Also instructive is          Danca.      In that case, the plaintiff\n\nand her family members sued an ERISA health insurer and utilization\n\nreview firm for alleged negligence in the course of treatment\n\nprecertification. Danca, 185 F.3d at 2.              We affirmed the dismissal\n\nof   claims    based   on   negligent          supervision        and    training    of\n\nprecertification personnel because such claims would \"indisputably\n\ncreate a threat of conflicting and inconsistent state and local\n\nregulation of the administration of ERISA plans.\"                       Id. at 7.   Our\n\ndecision in Danca reflected the concern that \"[d]ifferent states\n\ncould apply different standards for what constitutes a negligent\n\nprecertification       training     or    practice,\"          a     result     ERISA's\n\npreemption clause was designed to avoid.               Id.\n\n           Our concern here is no different. As we see it, Zipperer\n\nis asking that Massachusetts state law obligations be engrafted\n\nonto ERISA. Such claims, if allowed, would lead to the \"different\n\nadministrative procedures in different jurisdictions\" that ERISA is\n\n                                        -10-\n\fdesigned to avoid.       As such, they are preempted. The fact that\n\nZipperer is seeking negligence damages and not reinstatement of\n\nbenefits does not alter this result, as any determination of\n\nnegligence, in the present context, necessarily \"relates to\" the\n\nERISA plan.\n\n            Zipperer    also   argues   that   it   is   unclear   from   the\n\ncomplaint whether Raytheon is either an ERISA employer or plan\n\nadministrator, and thus whether it is entitled to preemption.             We\n\ndisagree.   In our view the district court correctly concluded that\n\nZipperer's claims only exist by virtue of Raytheon's status as an\n\nERISA employer and its administration of the ERISA plan at issue.\n\nHampers, 202 F.3d at 53.\n\n            We have reviewed the other issues Zipperer raised, and\n\nfind them without merit.\n\n                               III. CONCLUSION\n\n            We   conclude   that   Zipperer's    claims   for   negligence,\n\nequitable estoppel and negligent misrepresentation are preempted by\n\nERISA.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f",

(\"Raytheon\"). Zipperer asserted Massachusetts state law claims of negligence, equitable estoppel and negligent misrepresentation against Raytheon after Raytheon provided him with an erroneous estimate of his retirement benefits which, he claims, led to his voluntary early retirement. The district court, essentially adopting a magistrate judge's report and recommendation, ruled that Zipperer's claims are preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We state the facts as pleaded in the complaint. <i>See </i><i>Mass. Nurses Ass'n v. N. Adams State Reg'l Hosp.,</i> 467 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.2006). In November 1972, Zipperer began working for United Engineers &amp; Constructors, Inc. (\"UEC\"), a Raytheon subsidiary, as a field engineer in UEC's nuclear power division. Zipperer began participating in the UEC retirement plan in January 1975.</p>\n<p>At Raytheon's request, in November 1990 Zipperer began working for another Raytheon subsidiary, Raytheon Services, Nevada (\"RSN\"), a specialty company used by Raytheon solely for the purpose of administering work for the United States Department of Energy (\"DOE\"). While working at RSN, Zipperer remained a Raytheon employee, and no funds were transferred from the UEC retirement plan to the RSN pension plan. However, the Raytheon Benefit Center, which administered both plans, adjusted Zipperer's service date for the RSN plan to reflect his previous service at UEC.</p>\n<p>Zipperer's employment at RSN ended in October 1993. The next month, Zipperer began working for Raytheon Engineers &amp; Constructors, (\"REC\"), a successor to UEC. Upon his hiring, although no trust funds were transferred, REC credited Zipperer for his prior years of service with UEC for purposes of calculating his pension benefits. As with the Raytheon-affiliated UEC and RSN plans, the REC benefit plan was also administered by the Raytheon Benefit Center. On December 30, 1995, according to the Raytheon Benefit Center, RSN's pension trust funds were transferred to the Bechtel Nevada Employee Retirement Plan when Bechtel Nevada replaced RSN as a DOE contractor. Neither Raytheon nor RSN notified Zipperer's then-current employer, REC, that the RSN trust fund monies attributable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> to Zipperer's vested RSN benefit, which also included his prior service at UEC, had been transferred to Bechtel. None of the Raytheon pension plans was amended to reflect the transfer. Thus, when REC was purchased by Washington Group International (\"WGI\") in July 2000, Raytheon calculated an overstated benefit amount attributable to Zipperer, erroneously including amounts attributable to his original UEC service, which had already been subsumed into the RSN plan eventually transferred to Bechtel. In other words, both Bechtel and Raytheon were including Zipperer's original UEC service time in their respective pension calculations.</p>\n<p>In late 1999, at age 55, Zipperer requested from REC an estimate of his pension benefit, noting his prior service with UEC and \"Raytheon Company(s).\" According to the benefit computation subsequently provided to him by REC, Zipperer could expect to receive a monthly benefit of $1,100.17 if he chose a single life annuity with no right of survivorship, $1,063.11 if he chose a ten year \"certain and continuous option,\" and $980.55 if he chose a joint and survivor annuity. Basing their decision on the benefit estimate provided by Raytheon, Zipperer and his wife decided to retire, shortly after the sale of REC to WGI. At the time of his retirement, in September 2000, Zipperer was 56 years old and was earning $107,484 annually as a Project Control Manager.</p>\n<p>Zipperer, who chose the joint and survivor annuity, subsequently began receiving monthly pension payments from Raytheon of $840.64, approximately $140 less than the previous estimate. In June 2001, the Raytheon Benefit Center advised Zipperer in writing that his pension benefits had been overstated and that he was entitled to a monthly benefit of only $400.06. Zipperer, who concedes that he is currently receiving a pension from Bechtel, the amount of which takes into consideration his service time at RSN and UEC, was unsuccessful in his internal appeals of the benefit determination. After exhausting the internal appeals process, Zipperer filed a complaint against Raytheon in Massachusetts Superior Court alleging negligence, equitable estoppel and negligent misrepresentation. Raytheon timely removed the case to federal court, and subsequently moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that Zipperer's claims were preempted by ERISA. After a hearing, a magistrate judge recommended allowing the motion. The magistrate judge concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote>Allowing a cause of action to proceed for the negligence in making the representation or the negligence in maintaining and transferring the pertinent records amounts to an alternative enforcement mechanism to enforce (or estop the employer from denying) extra-contractual benefits. Such claims inevitably and directly conflict with the carefully chosen and carefully limited remedies provided under ERISA. . . . Regardless of the label of the state law claims, in essence they seek extra-contractual benefits not authorized by the terms of the Plan. Such an end run around the carefully crafted benefits Raytheon chose to provide amounts to an attempt to authorize remedies beyond those provided by the Plan.</blockquote>\n<p>Report and Recommendation at 10.</p>\n<p>Zipperer objected to the magistrate judge's recommendation, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 72, but the district court adopted the recommendations in all material respects.<sup>[1]</sup> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>We review de novo the district court's grant of judgment on the pleadings. <i>Mass. Nurses Ass'n,</i> 467 F.3d at 31. We view the facts contained in the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of P.R.,</i> 445 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.2006). Judgment on the pleadings is proper \"only if the uncontested and properly considered facts conclusively establish the movant's entitlement to a favorable judgment.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Zipperer advances several theories on appeal. First, he argues that his claims do not relate to Raytheon's retirement plan, and do not duplicate, supplement or supplant ERISA's civil enforcement provisions. Instead, he says, his claims relate only to Raytheon's \"independent legal obligation\" to keep proper records. He further argues that his claims do not relate to the retirement plan, because he is seeking only negligence damages and not reinstatement of promised benefits. Finally, Zipperer maintains that even if preemption would otherwise be appropriate, the district court erroneously concluded that Raytheon was acting as \"an ERISA employer\" during the relevant time period.</p>\n<p>Our analysis begins with § 514 of ERISA, which provides that ERISA preempts \"any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan. . . .\"<sup>[2]</sup> 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a). \"The term `State law' includes all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law, of any State.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1144(c)(1). A law \"relates to\" an employee benefit plan \"if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\" <i>Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon,</i> 498 U.S. 133, 139, 111 S.Ct. 478, 112 L.Ed.2d 474 (1990) (quoting <i>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 463 U.S. 85, 96-97, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983)). A state law can be considered \"related to\" a benefit plan  and thus preempted  \"even if the law is not specifically designed to affect such plans, or the effect is only indirect.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Pilot Life Insurance Co. v. Dedeaux,</i> 481 U.S. 41, 47, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987)).</p>\n<p>While ERISA's preemption is not boundless, it is far reaching. In determining the reach of ERISA preemption, the Supreme Court has cautioned against a literal reading of ERISA § 514(a)'s \"relate to\" standard, and ruled that courts must \"`look instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive.'\" <i>Hampers v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co.,</i> 202 F.3d 44, 51 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting <i>N.Y. State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co.,</i> 514 U.S. 645, 656, 115 S.Ct. 1671, 131 L.Ed.2d 695 (1995)). ERISA's objectives include providing a \"uniform national administration of ERISA plans\" and avoiding inconsistent state regulation of such plans. <i>Danca v. Private Health Care Sys., Inc.,</i> 185 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1999) (citing <i>Travelers,</i> 514 U.S. at 656-58, 115 S.Ct. 1671). Three categories of state regulation that have been identified as conflicting with these objectives are: 1) those that mandate employee benefit structures or their administration; 2) those that bind plan administrators to a particular choice; and 3) causes of action that provide alternative enforcement mechanisms to ERISA's own enforcement scheme. <i>Travelers,</i> 514 U.S. at 658-59, 115 S.Ct. 1671; <i>Hampers,</i> 202 F.3d at 44. Looking to the real nature of the plaintiff's claims, regardless of how <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> they are characterized in his complaint, <i>Hampers,</i> 202 F.3d at 51, we conclude that the first and third categories of conflicting state regulation are implicated here.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, Zipperer first argues that his suit does not relate to Raytheon's retirement plan, and does not duplicate, supplement or supplant ERISA's civil enforcement provisions. We disagree. The complaint's three counts rely on the common claim that Raytheon's negligent recordkeeping led to his reliance on an erroneous estimate of his retirement benefits. In our view, even a narrow reading of section 514(a)'s \"related to\" provision yields a conclusion that Zipperer's claims are preempted, and that is because the claims can only be evaluated with respect to Raytheon's recordkeeping responsibilities for the plan. Such responsibilities were part and parcel of Raytheon's plan administration. Subjecting Raytheon's plan administration to the state law scrutiny Zipperer seeks would conflict with ERISA's proscription against state law \"mandat[ing] plan administration\" and would also impermissibly create \"an alternative enforcement scheme\" to ERISA's own recordkeeping and reporting requirements. <i>Travelers,</i> 514 U.S. at 658-59, 115 S.Ct. 1671; <i>Hampers,</i> 202 F.3d at 51. Moreover, allowing a claim to proceed under Massachusetts law would inexorably  and impermissiblylead to inconsistent state regulations, as state courts \"develop different substantive standards applicable to the same employer conduct, requiring the tailoring of plans and employer conduct to the peculiarities of the law of each jurisdiction. Such an outcome is fundamentally at odds\" with ERISA's goal of uniformity. <i>McClendon,</i> 498 U.S. at 142, 111 S.Ct. 478.</p>\n<p>If we had any doubt about whether Zipperer's claims are preempted, we note that we faced a nearly identical situation in <i>Carlo v. Reed Rolled Thread Die Co.,</i> 49 F.3d 790 (1st Cir.1995). There, the plaintiff filed state law misrepresentation claims against his employer after he accepted an early retirement offer which, it turns out, was based on inaccurate information provided by the employer. <i>Id.</i> at 792. We affirmed the dismissal of the complaint on preemption grounds, noting that an analysis of plaintiff's claims would \"ultimately depend on an analysis\" of the ERISA plan at issue, to which the claims were thus \"inseparably connected.\" <i>Id.</i> at 795. Similarly, Zipperer's claims are \"inseparably connected\" to the Raytheon plan and its administration. <i>See also </i><i>Degnan v. Publicker Indus., Inc.,</i> 83 F.3d 27 (1st Cir. 1996) (affirming dismissal, on preemption grounds, of plaintiff's state law misrepresentation claims against a former employer who allegedly reneged on certain promises it made regarding plaintiff's retirement benefits).</p>\n<p>Also instructive is <i>Danca.</i> In that case, the plaintiff and her family members sued an ERISA health insurer and utilization review firm for alleged negligence in the course of treatment precertification. <i>Danca,</i> 185 F.3d at 2. We affirmed the dismissal of claims based on negligent supervision and training of precertification personnel because such claims would \"indisputably create a threat of conflicting and inconsistent state and local regulation of the administration of ERISA plans.\" <i>Id.</i> at 7. Our decision in <i>Danca</i> reflected the concern that \"[d]ifferent states could apply different standards for what constitutes a negligent precertification training or practice,\" a result ERISA's preemption clause was designed to avoid. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Our concern here is no different. As we see it, Zipperer is asking that Massachusetts state law obligations be engrafted onto ERISA. Such claims, if allowed, would lead to the \"different administrative procedures in different jurisdictions\" that ERISA is designed to avoid. As such, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> they are preempted. The fact that Zipperer is seeking negligence damages and not reinstatement of benefits does not alter this result, as any determination of negligence, in the present context, necessarily \"relates to\" the ERISA plan.</p>\n<p>Zipperer also argues that it is unclear from the complaint whether Raytheon is either an ERISA employer or plan administrator, and thus whether it is entitled to preemption. We disagree. In our view the district court correctly concluded that Zipperer's claims only exist by virtue of Raytheon's status as an ERISA employer and its administration of the ERISA plan at issue. <i>Hampers,</i> 202 F.3d at 53.</p>\n<p>We have reviewed the other issues Zipperer raised, and find them without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We conclude that Zipperer's claims for negligence, equitable estoppel and negligent misrepresentation are preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Both the magistrate judge and the district court provided Zipperer with opportunities to amend his Complaint.

(\"Raytheon\"). Zipperer asserted Massachusetts state law claims of negligence, equitable estoppel and negligent misrepresentation against Raytheon after Raytheon provided him with an erroneous estimate of his retirement benefits which, he claims, led to his voluntary early retirement. The district court, essentially adopting a magistrate judge's report and recommendation, ruled that Zipperer's claims are preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We state the facts as pleaded in the complaint. <i>See </i><i>Mass. Nurses Ass'n v. N. Adams State Reg'l Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2006). In November 1972, Zipperer began working for United Engineers &amp; Constructors, Inc. (\"UEC\"), a Raytheon subsidiary, as a field engineer in UEC's nuclear power division. Zipperer began participating in the UEC retirement plan in January 1975.</p>\n<p>At Raytheon's request, in November 1990 Zipperer began working for another Raytheon subsidiary, Raytheon Services, Nevada (\"RSN\"), a specialty company used by Raytheon solely for the purpose of administering work for the United States Department of Energy (\"DOE\"). While working at RSN, Zipperer remained a Raytheon employee, and no funds were transferred from the UEC retirement plan to the RSN pension plan. However, the Raytheon Benefit Center, which administered both plans, adjusted Zipperer's service date for the RSN plan to reflect his previous service at UEC.</p>\n<p>Zipperer's employment at RSN ended in October 1993. The next month, Zipperer began working for Raytheon Engineers &amp; Constructors, (\"REC\"), a successor to UEC. Upon his hiring, although no trust funds were transferred, REC credited Zipperer for his prior years of service with UEC for purposes of calculating his pension benefits. As with the Raytheon-affiliated UEC and RSN plans, the REC benefit plan was also administered by the Raytheon Benefit Center. On December 30, 1995, according to the Raytheon Benefit Center, RSN's pension trust funds were transferred to the Bechtel Nevada Employee Retirement Plan when Bechtel Nevada replaced RSN as a DOE contractor.

None of the Raytheon pension plans was amended to reflect the transfer. Thus, when REC was purchased by Washington Group International (\"WGI\") in July 2000, Raytheon calculated an overstated benefit amount attributable to Zipperer, erroneously including amounts attributable to his original UEC service, which had already been subsumed into the RSN plan eventually transferred to Bechtel.

Basing their decision on the benefit estimate provided by Raytheon, Zipperer and his wife decided to retire, shortly after the sale of REC to WGI.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1671</span></a></span>; <i>Hampers,</i> 202 F.3d at 51. Moreover, allowing a claim to proceed under Massachusetts law would inexorably  and impermissiblylead to inconsistent state regulations, as state courts \"develop different substantive standards applicable to the same employer conduct, requiring the tailoring of plans and employer conduct to the peculiarities of the law of each jurisdiction. Such an outcome is fundamentally at odds\" with ERISA's goal of uniformity. <i>McClendon,</i> 498 U.S. at 142, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112512\"><a href=\"/opinion/112512/ingersoll-rand-co-v-mcclendon/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>If we had any doubt about whether Zipperer's claims are preempted, we note that we faced a nearly identical situation in <i>Carlo v. Reed Rolled Thread Die Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691308\"><a href=\"/opinion/691308/pens-plan-guide-p-23907e-victor-e-carlo-jr-and-kathleen-m-carlo-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995). There, the plaintiff filed state law misrepresentation claims against his employer after he accepted an early retirement offer which, it turns out, was based on inaccurate information provided by the employer. <i>Id.</i> at 792. We affirmed the dismissal of the complaint on preemption grounds, noting that an analysis of plaintiff's claims would \"ultimately depend on an analysis\" of the ERISA plan at issue, to which the claims were thus \"inseparably connected.\" <i>Id.</i> at 795. Similarly, Zipperer's claims are \"inseparably connected\" to the Raytheon plan and its administration. <i>See also </i><i>Degnan v. Publicker Indus., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717573\"><a href=\"/opinion/717573/20-employee-benefits-cas-1129-pens-plan-guide-p-23922h-william-degnan/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1996) (affirming dismissal, on preemption grounds, of plaintiff's state law misrepresentation claims against a former employer who allegedly reneged on certain promises it made regarding plaintiff's retirement benefits).</p>\n<p>Also instructive is <i>Danca.</i> In that case, the plaintiff and her family members sued an ERISA health insurer and utilization review firm for alleged negligence in the course of treatment precertification. <i>Danca,</i> 185 F.3d at 2. We affirmed the dismissal of claims based on negligent supervision and training of precertification personnel because such claims would \"indisputably create a threat of conflicting and inconsistent state and local regulation of the administration of ERISA plans.\" <i>Id.</i> at 7. Our decision in <i>Danca</i> reflected the concern that \"[d]ifferent states could apply different standards for what constitutes a negligent precertification training or practice,\" a result ERISA's preemption clause was designed to avoid. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Our concern here is no different. As we see it, Zipperer is asking that Massachusetts state law obligations be engrafted onto ERISA. Such claims, if allowed, would lead to the \"different administrative procedures in different jurisdictions\" that ERISA is designed to avoid. As such, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> they are preempted. The fact that Zipperer is seeking negligence damages and not reinstatement of benefits does not alter this result, as any determination of negligence, in the present context, necessarily \"relates to\" the ERISA plan.</p>\n<p>Zipperer also argues that it is unclear from the complaint whether Raytheon is either an ERISA employer or plan administrator, and thus whether it is entitled to preemption. We disagree. In our view the district court correctly concluded that Zipperer's claims only exist by virtue of Raytheon's status as an ERISA employer and its administration of the ERISA plan at issue. <i>Hampers,</i> 202 F.3d at 53.</p>\n<p>We have reviewed the other issues Zipperer raised, and find them without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We conclude that Zipperer's claims for negligence, equitable estoppel and negligent misrepresentation are preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Both the magistrate judge and the district court provided Zipperer with opportunities to amend his Complaint. He did not accept either invitation.</p>\n<p>[2]  There is no dispute that the Plan at issue in this case is an \"employee benefit plan,\" within the meaning of ERISA.</p>\n\n</div>",
