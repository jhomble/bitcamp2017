On  April  4, 1988,  John\n                               \n\nAchilli, a union shop  steward and a bakery sales  driver at\n\nthe John J. Nissen Baking Company, told other drivers not to\n\nload  extra boxes  of cream  horns (a  kind of  eclair) that\n\nNissen  wanted  them  to  transport.     Nissen  immediately\n\ndismissed  Achilli  for   having  violated  an  anti-wildcat\n\nprovision in  the collective bargaining  agreement.  Achilli\n\nwent  to arbitration,  lost, and  then brought  this lawsuit\n\nagainst his Local Union  (as well as Nissen), claiming  that\n\nthe  Local  had not  represented  him properly.    See Labor\n                                                      \n\nManagement Relations Act (\"LMRA\")    9(a), 301(a), 29 U.S.C.\n\n   159(a), 185(a); Vaca v. Sipes,  386 U.S. 171 (1967).  The\n                                \n\ndistrict court agreed with Achilli that 1) the Local  should\n\nhave  told  the arbitrators  that  Achilli,  in effect,  was\n\nfollowing  union  orders, and  2)  had  the arbitrators  (or\n\nNissen)  known this,  Achilli probably  would have  kept his\n\njob.   The  court awarded  Achilli damages  of $15,000  plus\n\nattorneys' fees.   The Local and Achilli have filed appeals.\n\nWe affirm the judgment.  \n\n                             I.\n\n                  The Local Union's Appeal\n                                          \n\n          The  Local  makes six  arguments,  which we  shall\n\ndiscuss in turn.\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n          1.  The  Basic Violation.   The Local argues  that\n                                  \n\nthe evidence  does not support the  district court's finding\n\nthat it failed to fulfill  its legal obligation to represent\n\nits member Achilli fairly.  See Vaca, 386 U.S. at 190.

It  does mean,\n\nhowever,  that a  labor  organization will  be liable  if it\n\nsignificantly  harms its  members through  actions  that are\n\narbitrary, reckless, or  in bad  faith.  Vaca,  386 U.S.  at\n                                             \n\n190; Alicea  v. Suffield Poultry, Inc., 902 F.2d 125, 129-30\n                                      \n\n(1st  Cir.  1990).

Amalgamated Ass'n of  Street,\n                                                            \n\netc. v. Lockridge, 403 U.S. 274, 301 (1971).\n                 \n\n          The  evidence in  the  record,  read favorably  to\n\nAchilli, the winning party, reveals the following:\n\n          1.   Achilli, a driver-salesman and  shop steward,\n               had worked at Nissen for ten years.\n\n          2.   During 1987 and 1988, Nissen management would\n               sometimes provide drivers with more  boxes of\n               pastry than the  drivers had expected.   This\n               practice  -- of  supplying  what the  drivers\n               called  \"add-ons\"   --   was  a   source   of\n               continuing controversy.\n\n          3.   In  October 1987,  at a  Local meeting,  Paul\n               Hanoian,  the  Local's  Business Agent,  told\n               Achilli and other drivers that they were \"not\n               to  take unnecessary  add-[ons]\" and  that it\n               was \"left  up to the shop  steward to decide\"\n               whether  or  not   a  particular  add-on  was\n               \"unnecessary.\" \n\n          4.   On April 4,  1988, Nissen doubled  the number\n               of  cream  horns the  drivers were  to carry,\n               leading  many drivers  to  object.    Achilli\n               wrote a sign telling the drivers to leave the\n               \"add-on cream horns\" behind, and  several did\n               so.\n\n          5.   Later that day, Hanoian learned of the add-on\n               cream horn incident, and that Nissen intended\n               to dismiss Achilli, while retaining the other\n               drivers.   Hanoian spoke  to Nissen, conceded\n               that  Achilli's  conduct  was  improper,  but\n               asked  Nissen  to   retain  Achilli   anyway.\n               Hanoian  said  nothing   about  his   October\n                                                            \n               meeting instruction.\n                                   \n\n          6.   Nissen  dismissed Achilli.   The Local sought\n               arbitration.  It  provided a union  official,\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n               Joseph   Padellero,  to   represent  Achilli.\n               Achilli told Padellero (with Hanoian present)\n               that  he  had  \"left the  cream  horns behind\n               because  of the  meeting .  . .  in October.\"\n               Hanoian replied,  \"You can't  say that .  . .\n               .[T]he company  can sue the union  if you say\n               that.\"   And  Hanoian later  repeated, \"Well,\n               you just can't say that.\" \n\n          7.   Later, at the arbitration  meeting, Padellero\n               conceded that Achilli's  action violated  the\n               collective  bargaining agreement.  And, while\n               he    pointed    out    various    mitigating\n               circumstances,  he  said  nothing  about  the\n                                                            \n               October meeting instruction.  The arbitration\n                                           \n               panel decided against Achilli (2-0).\n\n          These   facts  indicate  a  conflict  between  the\n\nLocal's  duty to represent  a member fairly  and the Local's\n\nown  interest.  The Local  resolved the conflict  in its own\n\nfavor.   The evidence  shows  no legitimate  reason for  the\n\nLocal's  choice, and it does not show that a contrary choice\n\nwould have hurt  the Local.   Cf. Ooley  v. Schwitzer  Div.,\n                                                            \n\nHousehold Mfg. Inc.,  961 F.2d 1293,  1303 (7th Cir.  1992).\n                   \n\nThe evidence also permitted the district court to find that,\n\nhad the  Local resolved the  conflict differently --  had it\n\ntold  Nissen or  the arbitrators  about the  October meeting\n\ninstruction  --then  Achilli,  like  the  other  wildcatting\n\ndrivers, would  have kept his  job.    At  trial, the  Local\n\ndefended  itself primarily  by  trying to  show a  different\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nversion  of  the facts.   But,  the district  court believed\n\nAchilli's witnesses, not the Local's. \n\n          The  Local adds  that Achilli,  on his  own, could\n\nhave  told   the  arbitrators  about  the   October  meeting\n\ninstruction.  But, the  district court could reasonably find\n\nthe contrary,  namely that the Local's  pressure, along with\n\nAchilli's dependence upon his representative at the hearing,\n\nmake    his   failure   to    volunteer   this   information\n\nunderstandable,  indeed, less  than  purely voluntary,  and,\n\ntherefore,  insufficient  to  absolve the  Local  of  causal\n\nresponsibility.  Cf. Alicea, 902 F.2d at 127-29 &amp; n.6, 133. \n                           \n\n          2.   Exhaustion.   The  Local argues  that Achilli\n                         \n\nshould  have  exhausted   internal  union  remedies   before\n\nbringing  this  lawsuit.   Clayton  v.  Int'l Union,  United\n                                                            \n\nAuto., etc., 451 U.S. 679 (1981).  We have no doubt that the\n           \n\nexhaustion requirement is critically important, for it helps\n\nto guarantee  union self-government  and independence.   See\n                                                            \n\nNLRB v. Indus. Union  of Marine &amp; Shipbuilding Workers,  391\n                                                      \n\nU.S. 418, 429  (1968) (Harlan,  J., concurring).   But,  the\n\nLocal  cannot insist that Achilli exhaust a remedy that does\n\nnot exist.   Clayton, 451  U.S. at  689 (1981).   Here,  the\n                    \n\nLocal, to  demonstrate the  existence of an  internal remedy\n\nthat might have  given Achilli the damages  he seeks, simply\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\npointed  to  Article  XIX,  section 9(a)  of  the  Teamsters\n\nConstitution, which reads as follows:\n\n          Decisions and penalties imposed upon . .\n          . Local  Unions .  . . found  guilty [by\n          the    Teamsters'    internal    appeals\n          tribunal]   of   charges   [brought   by\n          aggrieved   members]   may  consist   of\n          reprimands,      fines,     suspensions,\n          expulsions, revocations,  denial to hold\n          any office .  . ., or commands to  do or\n          perform,  or  refrain   from  doing   or\n          performing, specified  acts. . . .  If a\n          fine is assessed against a Local Union .\n          . . the payment shall be to the treasury\n          of the Joint Council.\n\nThis  provision does  not  say that  the internal  procedure\n                         \n\npermits the award of damages.  Its statement that any \"fine\"\n\nwill be made \"to the treasury of the Joint Council\" suggests\n\nthe opposite.  And, two federal circuits have said that this\n\nprovision  seems not to provide for a damage remedy.  Beyene\n                                                            \n\nv.  Coleman Sec.

In these  circumstances, the district court could\n\nproperly hold that  the Local failed to prove  the existence\n\nof an internal damage remedy.  See Doty v.

Breach of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n                                                           \n\nThe  Local argues that, whether or not Achilli was following\n\nHanoian's  instructions,  Achilli  nonetheless violated  the\n\ncollective  bargaining  agreement,  which  prohibited  union\n\nrepresentatives from inciting work-stoppages.  Hence, Nissen\n\nhad  \"just cause\"  to  dismiss Achilli,  and Nissen  did not\n\nbreach  the contract in  doing so.   The  Local adds  that a\n\nsection  301 plaintiff must  prove not  only that  the union\n\nbreached its duty to represent him fairly, but also that the\n\nemployer  violated the collective bargaining agreement. LMRA\n\n  301(a), 29 U.S.C.   185(a); see Kissinger v. United States\n                                                            \n\nPostal Service, 801 F.2d 551, 553 (1st Cir. 1986).\n              \n\n          The  short, conclusive answer  to this argument is\n\nthat  the district  court found  that the  arbitrators would\n\nlikely have  ordered Achilli reinstated.   And, that holding\n\nhad adequate record support.  Arbitrators, who are primarily\n\nresponsible for interpreting contractual terms such as \"just\n\ncause,\" normally insist that  employers impose punishment in\n\na consistent manner, treating alike employees who act alike,\n\nat  least in  the  absence  of  a  reasonable  basis  for  a\n\nvariation.  See  Frank Elkouri  &amp;  Edna  Asper Elkouri,  How\n                                                            \n\nArbitration  Works 684  (4th ed. 1985).   The  evidence here\n                  \n\nshows  that  Nissen  did  not discipline  a  different  shop\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nsteward who, following  union instructions, had  instituted,\n\nor  at least condoned, another work stoppage.  It also shows\n\nthat Nissen did  not punish any of the other drivers who, on\n\nApril 4 and 5, 1987, engaged in  a wild-cat work stoppage at\n\nthe   direction  of  their   union  representative,  namely,\n\nAchilli.  The district court could therefore have reasonably\n\npredicted that  Achilli's arbitrators would  have set  aside\n\nhis dismissal as lacking \"just cause\" had it only known that\n\nAchilli, too, was following instructions.  \n\n          4.   Measuring Damages.  The  district court found\n                                \n\nthat  the  Local's  bad   faith  conduct  led  to  Achilli's\n\ndischarge.   It measured  the harm  inflicted by  taking the\n\nwages that Nissen would have paid Achilli as long as  he was\n\nlooking for  work, and  subtracting the  wages he  earned in\n\nother, interim jobs.  The total award came to about $15,000.\n\nThe  Local argues that the  court's damage award was legally\n\nimproper.\n\n          First, the  Local says  that the court  should not\n\nhave made an award, but instead  should have resubmitted the\n\ncase  to arbitration, or, at least, have subtracted from the\n\n$15,000 award a sum  representing a lesser, but alternative,\n\npunishment  that a knowledgeable Nissen or arbitration board\n\nmight  have imposed in lieu of discharge.  The law, however,\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\ngrants  courts  broad authority  to  create an  \"appropriate\n\nremedy\" for a  breach of the duty of  \"fair representation,\"\n\nwhich  remedy  may  \"vary  with  the  circumstances  of  the\n\nparticular  breach.\"     Vaca,  386  U.S.   at  195.     The\n                             \n\ncircumstances  here  include fairly  strong evidence  that a\n\nfair arbitration proceeding would have led to reinstatement,\n\nlittle evidence that  it would have meant any large monetary\n\npunishment, no evidence about the precise amount of any such\n\npenalty,  a fairly  small damages  award,  and comparatively\n\nlarge administrative  costs and  delays attached to  any new\n\narbitration proceeding.   These circumstances, in  our view,\n\nmake the $15,000 damage remedy  a fair and practical remedy.\n\nGiven   these  circumstances,  the   court  need   not  have\n\nresubmitted  the matter  to  arbitration, nor  need it  have\n\nsubtracted  some  unknown   small  sum  as   representing  a\n\nhypothetical  alternative punishment.   Id.  at  196; Kheel,\n                                           \n\nLabor Law   28.02[2][iii] at 28-22. \n         \n\n          Second,  the Local  argues  that  Achilli did  not\n\nproperly  mitigate  his damages  by looking  for alternative\n\nemployment after  he was  discharged.  The  record, however,\n\ncontains   evidence   that   Achilli  did   read   newspaper\n\nadvertisements  but  found   nothing  comparable;  that   he\n\ninvestigated a job possibility  with a lumber company, which\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nhe turned down  because \"it  didn't pay  enough money\";  and\n\nthat his failure to  pursue a job prospect to  deliver bread\n\nin Worcester was due to the  long commute and the fact  that\n\nhe had received  no definite offer.   Though the issue is  a\n\nfairly close  one, the  district court,  in our  view, could\n\nconclude  from this evidence that the  Local failed to prove\n\nnon-mitigation.  See  NLRB v. Arduini  Mfg. Corp., 394  F.2d\n                                                 \n\n420, 423 (1st Cir. 1968) (union bears burden of proving that\n\nthe employee  failed to make  a reasonable search  for post-\n\ntermination employment).\n\n          Third, the  Local argues  that the  district court\n\nshould have required the employer, Nissen, to pay a share of\n\nthe  damages.  The short  answer to this  claim, however, is\n\nthat  the court  apportions  liability between  employer and\n\nunion \"according to the damage caused by the fault of each.\"\n\nVaca, 386 U.S. at  197.    Here, the court could  reasonably\n    \n\nconclude that the  employer was  not at fault.   Hence,  its\n\napportionment of  all the damages to the Local is reasonable\n\nand  lawful.  See Baskin  v. Hawley, 807  F.2d 1120, 1132-33\n                                   \n\n(2d Cir. 1986).\n\n          Fourth, the  Local, conceding that  the court  may\n\naward  attorney's fees as part of the damages that it caused\n\nAchilli, argues  that the court should  have subtracted from\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\ntotal  fees  an  amount   reflecting  legal  time  spent  on\n\nAchilli's unsuccessful legal claims.  Lewis v. Kendrick, 944\n                                                       \n\nF.2d  949,  957-58 (1st  Cir.  1991).   This  apportionment,\n\nhowever,  is  primarily for  the  district  court, not  this\n\ncourt, to make.  Zuniga v. United Can Co., 812 F.2d 443, 454\n                                        \n\n(9th  Cir. 1987).  The record  before us adequately supports\n\nits  conclusion  that the  legal  time and  energy  spent on\n\nunsuccessful  claims was  either not readily  separable from\n\nthat spent  on the successful  claims, or separable  but not\n\nsignificant.  \n\n                            II.\n\n                      Achilli's Appeal\n                                      \n\n          Achilli makes two arguments.   First, he says that\n\nthe district  court should have ordered  Nissen to reinstate\n\nhim, something that Nissen  is now no longer willing  to do.\n\nThe district court, however,  could lawfully have found that\n\nreinstatement  is no longer  practicable.  See  De Arroyo v.\n                                                         \n\nSindicato de  Trabajadores Packinghouse,  425 F.2d  281, 292\n                                       \n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, Puerto Rico Tel. Co. v. De Arroyo,\n                                                           \n\n400 U.S. 877 (1970). \n\n          Regardless,  Achilli's  complaint did  not mention\n\nreinstatement; and,  during trial,  when  Achilli was  asked\n\nwhether  he had any interest in returning to Nissen, he said\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\nthat he did not.  We concede that, at the very end of trial,\n\nAchilli's counsel, in the context of talking about insurance\n\nbenefits, said that Achilli  would receive \"credit . .  . if\n\nreinstated,\"  and,  in  response  to  the  court's  question\n\nwhether Achilli was \"asking for reinstatement\" answered, \"he\n\nis.\"   But,  counsel  immediately added  the rather  obscure\n\ncomment that Achilli might \"take the position that the Court\n\ncan order reinstatement,\"  and, if the court did so, he \"can\n\nmake a  decision as to whether he would accept reinstatement\n\nor not.\"  In this context, the court found  that Achilli had\n\nwaived the reinstatement remedy.  That finding, in our view,\n\nis lawful. Tinsley v. United  Parcel Service, Inc., 665 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n778, 779  (7th Cir. 1981), overruled on  other grounds, Rupe\n                                                            \n\nv. Spector Freight Sys. Inc., 679 F.2d 685 (7th Cir. 1982).\n                            \n\n          Second,  Achilli  says  that  the  district  court\n\nwrongly decided to  end its damage calculation as of January\n\n1, 1989,  when  the court  found  that Achilli  had  stopped\n\ntrying to mitigate his  damages.  Achilli concedes that,  on\n\nthat date, he stopped  looking for bread delivery  work, and\n\nbegan his own house painting business.  He says his decision\n\nto start  that alternative, lower  paying, business amounted\n\nto reasonable mitigation.  The problem for Achilli, however,\n\nis that the district court decided that his decision to stop\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nsearching  and start painting was not reasonable mitigation,\n                                     \n\nbut,  rather,  constituted  a  failure  to  use  \"reasonable\n\ndiligence  in  obtaining  new employment,\"  and  thereby  to\n\nmitigate loss of income.  Arduini, 394 F.2d at 423.  This is\n                                 \n\na matter  primarily for  the district  court.   In reviewing\n\nthis conclusion, we have  compared the more extensive search\n\nefforts made in  NLRB v.  Ryder System, Inc.,  983 F.2d  705\n                                            \n\n(6th Cir. 1993), with  Achilli's efforts here.  In  Ryder, a\n                                                         \n\nwrongfully discharged trucker \"diligently  sought work as  a\n\ntruckdriver,\"  taking short-term  jobs  at  seven  different\n\ntrucking firms  for two  years, and sending  applications to\n\ntwenty others.  Id. at 714-15.  Achilli, by contrast, looked\n                   \n\nfor work for  nine months,  during which time  he failed  to\n\nfollow up on several union-provided leads.  However we would\n\nhave  decided the  question  were we  a  trial court,  these\n\ncircumstances are sufficient on appeal to justify a district\n\ncourt conclusion that Achilli gave up too soon.\n\n          For  these reasons  the judgment  of the  district\n\ncourt is\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n",

Achilli, a driver-salesman and  shop steward,\n               had worked at Nissen for ten years.\n\n          2.   During 1987 and 1988, Nissen management would\n               sometimes provide drivers with more  boxes of\n               pastry than the  drivers had expected.   This\n               practice  -- of  supplying  what the  drivers\n               called  \"add-ons\"   --   was  a   source   of\n               continuing controversy.\n\n          3.   In  October 1987,  at a  Local meeting,  Paul\n               Hanoian,  the  Local's  Business Agent,  told\n               Achilli and other drivers that they were \"not\n               to  take unnecessary  add-[ons]\" and  that it\n               was \"left  up to the shop  steward to decide\"\n               whether  or  not   a  particular  add-on  was\n               \"unnecessary.\" \n\n          4.   On April 4,  1988, Nissen doubled  the number\n               of  cream  horns the  drivers were  to carry,\n               leading  many drivers  to  object.    Achilli\n               wrote a sign telling the drivers to leave the\n               \"add-on cream horns\" behind, and  several did\n               so.\n\n          5.   Later that day, Hanoian learned of the add-on\n               cream horn incident, and that Nissen intended\n               to dismiss Achilli, while retaining the other\n               drivers.   Hanoian spoke  to Nissen, conceded\n               that  Achilli's  conduct  was  improper,  but\n               asked  Nissen  to   retain  Achilli   anyway.\n               Hanoian  said  nothing   about  his   October\n                                                            \n               meeting instruction.\n                                   \n\n          6.   Nissen  dismissed Achilli.   The Local sought\n               arbitration.  It  provided a union  official,\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n               Joseph   Padellero,  to   represent  Achilli.\n               Achilli told Padellero (with Hanoian present)\n               that  he  had  \"left the  cream  horns behind\n               because  of the  meeting .  . .  in October.\"\n               Hanoian replied,  \"You can't  say that .  . .\n               .[T]he company  can sue the union  if you say\n               that.\"   And  Hanoian later  repeated, \"Well,\n               you just can't say that.\" \n\n          7.   Later, at the arbitration  meeting, Padellero\n               conceded that Achilli's  action violated  the\n               collective  bargaining agreement.  And, while\n               he    pointed    out    various    mitigating\n               circumstances,  he  said  nothing  about  the\n                                                            \n               October meeting instruction.

The Local  resolved the conflict  in its own\n\nfavor.   The evidence  shows  no legitimate  reason for  the\n\nLocal's  choice, and it does not show that a contrary choice\n\nwould have hurt  the Local.   Cf. Ooley  v. Schwitzer  Div.,\n                                                            \n\nHousehold Mfg.

At  trial, the  Local\n\ndefended  itself primarily  by  trying to  show a  different\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nversion  of  the facts.   But,  the district  court believed\n\nAchilli's witnesses, not the Local's. \n\n          The  Local adds  that Achilli,  on his  own, could\n\nhave  told   the  arbitrators  about  the   October  meeting\n\ninstruction.  But, the  district court could reasonably find\n\nthe contrary,  namely that the Local's  pressure, along with\n\nAchilli's dependence upon his representative at the hearing,\n\nmake    his   failure   to    volunteer   this   information\n\nunderstandable,  indeed, less  than  purely voluntary,  and,\n\ntherefore,  insufficient  to  absolve the  Local  of  causal\n\nresponsibility.

The  Local argues  that Achilli\n                         \n\nshould  have  exhausted   internal  union  remedies   before\n\nbringing  this  lawsuit.   Clayton  v.

Here,  the\n                    \n\nLocal, to  demonstrate the  existence of an  internal remedy\n\nthat might have  given Achilli the damages  he seeks, simply\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\npointed  to  Article  XIX,  section 9(a)  of  the  Teamsters\n\nConstitution, which reads as follows:\n\n          Decisions and penalties imposed upon . .\n          .

If a\n          fine is assessed against a Local Union .\n          . . the payment shall be to the treasury\n          of the Joint Council.\n\nThis  provision does  not  say that  the internal  procedure\n                         \n\npermits the award of damages.  Its statement that any \"fine\"\n\nwill be made \"to the treasury of the Joint Council\" suggests\n\nthe opposite.

Breach of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n                                                           \n\nThe  Local argues that, whether or not Achilli was following\n\nHanoian's  instructions,  Achilli  nonetheless violated  the\n\ncollective  bargaining  agreement,  which  prohibited  union\n\nrepresentatives from inciting work-stoppages.  Hence, Nissen\n\nhad  \"just cause\"  to  dismiss Achilli,  and Nissen  did not\n\nbreach  the contract in  doing so.   The  Local adds  that a\n\nsection  301 plaintiff must  prove not  only that  the union\n\nbreached its duty to represent him fairly, but also that the\n\nemployer  violated the collective bargaining agreement.

United States\n                                                            \n\nPostal Service, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476640\"><a href=\"/opinion/476640/guy-w-kissinger-v-united-states-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553 (1st Cir. 1986).\n              \n\n          The  short, conclusive answer  to this argument is\n\nthat  the district  court found  that the  arbitrators would\n\nlikely have  ordered Achilli reinstated.   And, that holding\n\nhad adequate record support.  Arbitrators, who are primarily\n\nresponsible for interpreting contractual terms such as \"just\n\ncause,\" normally insist that  employers impose punishment in\n\na consistent manner, treating alike employees who act alike,\n\nat  least in  the  absence  of  a  reasonable  basis  for  a\n\nvariation.  See  Frank Elkouri  &amp;  Edna  Asper Elkouri,  How\n                                                            \n\nArbitration  Works 684  (4th ed. 1985).   The  evidence here\n                  \n\nshows  that  Nissen  did  not discipline  a  different  shop\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nsteward who, following  union instructions, had  instituted,\n\nor  at least condoned, another work stoppage.  It also shows\n\nthat Nissen did  not punish any of the other drivers who, on\n\nApril 4 and 5, 1987, engaged in  a wild-cat work stoppage at\n\nthe   direction  of  their   union  representative,  namely,\n\nAchilli.  The district court could therefore have reasonably\n\npredicted that  Achilli's arbitrators would  have set  aside\n\nhis dismissal as lacking \"just cause\" had it only known that\n\nAchilli, too, was following instructions.  \n\n          4.   Measuring Damages.  The  district court found\n                                \n\nthat  the  Local's  bad   faith  conduct  led  to  Achilli's\n\ndischarge.   It measured  the harm  inflicted by  taking the\n\nwages that Nissen would have paid Achilli as long as  he was\n\nlooking for  work, and  subtracting the  wages he  earned in\n\nother, interim jobs.  The total award came to about $15,000.\n\nThe  Local argues that the  court's damage award was legally\n\nimproper.\n\n          First, the  Local says  that the court  should not\n\nhave made an award, but instead  should have resubmitted the\n\ncase  to arbitration, or, at least, have subtracted from the\n\n$15,000 award a sum  representing a lesser, but alternative,\n\npunishment  that a knowledgeable Nissen or arbitration board\n\nmight  have imposed in lieu of discharge.  The law, however,\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\ngrants  courts  broad authority  to  create an  \"appropriate\n\nremedy\" for a  breach of the duty of  \"fair representation,\"\n\nwhich  remedy  may  \"vary  with  the  circumstances  of  the\n\nparticular  breach.\"     Vaca,  386  U.S.   at  195.     The\n                             \n\ncircumstances  here  include fairly  strong evidence  that a\n\nfair arbitration proceeding would have led to reinstatement,\n\nlittle evidence that  it would have meant any large monetary\n\npunishment, no evidence about the precise amount of any such\n\npenalty,  a fairly  small damages  award,  and comparatively\n\nlarge administrative  costs and  delays attached to  any new\n\narbitration proceeding.   These circumstances, in  our view,\n\nmake the $15,000 damage remedy  a fair and practical remedy.\n\nGiven   these  circumstances,  the   court  need   not  have\n\nresubmitted  the matter  to  arbitration, nor  need it  have\n\nsubtracted  some  unknown   small  sum  as   representing  a\n\nhypothetical  alternative punishment.   Id.  at  196; Kheel,\n                                           \n\nLabor Law   28.02[2][iii] at 28-22. \n         \n\n          Second,  the Local  argues  that  Achilli did  not\n\nproperly  mitigate  his damages  by looking  for alternative\n\nemployment after  he was  discharged.  The  record, however,\n\ncontains   evidence   that   Achilli  did   read   newspaper\n\nadvertisements  but  found   nothing  comparable;  that   he\n\ninvestigated a job possibility  with a lumber company, which\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\nhe turned down  because \"it  didn't pay  enough money\";  and\n\nthat his failure to  pursue a job prospect to  deliver bread\n\nin Worcester was due to the  long commute and the fact  that\n\nhe had received  no definite offer.   Though the issue is  a\n\nfairly close  one, the  district court,  in our  view, could\n\nconclude  from this evidence that the  Local failed to prove\n\nnon-mitigation.  See  NLRB v. Arduini  Mfg.

The short  answer to this  claim, however, is\n\nthat  the court  apportions  liability between  employer and\n\nunion \"according to the damage caused by the fault of each.\"\n\nVaca, 386 U.S. at  197.    Here, the court could  reasonably\n    \n\nconclude that the  employer was  not at fault.   Hence,  its\n\napportionment of  all the damages to the Local is reasonable\n\nand  lawful.  See Baskin  v.

The record  before us adequately supports\n\nits  conclusion  that the  legal  time and  energy  spent on\n\nunsuccessful  claims was  either not readily  separable from\n\nthat spent  on the successful  claims, or separable  but not\n\nsignificant.  \n\n                            II.\n\n                      Achilli's Appeal\n                                      \n\n          Achilli makes two arguments.   First, he says that\n\nthe district  court should have ordered  Nissen to reinstate\n\nhim, something that Nissen  is now no longer willing  to do.\n\nThe district court, however,  could lawfully have found that\n\nreinstatement  is no longer  practicable.

We concede that, at the very end of trial,\n\nAchilli's counsel, in the context of talking about insurance\n\nbenefits, said that Achilli  would receive \"credit . .  . if\n\nreinstated,\"  and,  in  response  to  the  court's  question\n\nwhether Achilli was \"asking for reinstatement\" answered, \"he\n\nis.\"   But,  counsel  immediately added  the rather  obscure\n\ncomment that Achilli might \"take the position that the Court\n\ncan order reinstatement,\"  and, if the court did so, he \"can\n\nmake a  decision as to whether he would accept reinstatement\n\nor not.\"  In this context, the court found  that Achilli had\n\nwaived the reinstatement remedy.  That finding, in our view,\n\nis lawful. Tinsley v.

Achilli concedes that,  on\n\nthat date, he stopped  looking for bread delivery  work, and\n\nbegan his own house painting business.  He says his decision\n\nto start  that alternative, lower  paying, business amounted\n\nto reasonable mitigation.  The problem for Achilli, however,\n\nis that the district court decided that his decision to stop\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nsearching  and start painting was not reasonable mitigation,\n                                     \n\nbut,  rather,  constituted  a  failure  to  use  \"reasonable\n\ndiligence  in  obtaining  new employment,\"  and  thereby  to\n\nmitigate loss of income.

However we would\n\nhave  decided the  question  were we  a  trial court,  these\n\ncircumstances are sufficient on appeal to justify a district\n\ncourt conclusion that Achilli gave up too soon.\n\n          For  these reasons  the judgment  of the  district\n\ncourt is\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n</pre>",
