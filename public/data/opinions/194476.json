Wells Fargo Alarm Services, 907\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1274, 1277 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          The facts in the light most favorable to Rivera are\n\nas  follows.  Rivera, a  member of the  New Progressive Party\n\n(\"NPP\"),  worked at  an  agency of  Puerto Rico's  government\n\nCorporacion  de  Fomento  Recreativo  since 1971.    In  that\n\norganization,  she  held  the career  position  of  Executive\n\nOfficer IV since February 1, 1984. \n\n          In December 1986, appellees, members of the Popular\n\nDemocratic Party  (\"PDP\") took Rivera's job  duties away from\n\nher and reassigned them to a member of the  PDP.  On the 22nd\n\nof that month, appellees also reduced her monthly salary from\n\n$1,131 to $998.  On May 30, 1987, appellees demoted Rivera to\n\nExecutive  Secretary I,  which  carries a  monthly salary  of\n\n$995.\n\n          As  a  result  of  these   actions,  Rivera  became\n\nseverely  depressed, and on March 27, 1987, she was placed on\n\nrest  status at the State Insurance Fund.  Rivera remained on\n\nrest status  until the  State Insurance Fund  declared itself\n\n\"without jurisdiction because [Rivera's]  emotional condition\n\n[is] due to political  discrimination.\"  Subsequently, Rivera\n\nreceived private psychiatric care.\n\n          After receiving psychiatric  care, Rivera  reported\n\nback  to work, and appellees  sent her to  the agency's press\n\noffice  where she  was  assigned minimal  duties by  a former\n\nsubordinate.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          In  September 1990, appellees transferred Rivera to\n\na  division that did not  require her skills  as an Executive\n\nSecretary.  Moreover,  at that division, Rivera  had no desk,\n\ntypewriter, or office.   Rivera never  received a hearing  on\n\nany of these demotions or transfers.\n\n                        LEGAL ANALYSIS\n                                      \n\nI.  Due Process\n               \n\n          The Due Process Clause of  the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nguarantees  public  employees  with  a  property interest  in\n\ncontinued employment the right to a pre-termination  hearing.\n\nCleveland Bd.  of  Educ. v.  Loudermill,  470 U.S.  532,  542\n                                       \n\n(1985).  State law determines whether an employee has such an\n\ninterest.  Bishop v. Wood,  426 U.S. 341, 344 (1976).   Under\n                         \n\nPuerto  Rico law,  a  career position  is a  constitutionally\n\nprotected property  interest.   Kaufmann v. Puerto  Rico Tel.\n                                                             \n\nCo.,  841 F.2d  1169, 1173  (1st Cir.  1988).   However, that\n   \n\nproperty  right is void  if the employee  acquired the career\n\nposition through a violation of the Puerto Rico Personnel Act\n\nor agency regulations promulgated under that Act.  Id.\n                                                     \n\n          No one disputes that Rivera held a career position.\n\nHowever,  appellees   contend  that  her  ascension   to  the\n\nExecutive Officer IV position  entailed two violations of the\n\nagency regulations.  First, they  argue that in October 1979,\n\nRivera  was  erroneously  reclassified  from  Secretary  V to\n\nExecutive Secretary  II.   Specifically, they state  that she\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ndid not perform functions  similar to those performed  in the\n\nExecutive  Secretary I position  for one year  as required by\n\nthe agency regulations.\n\n          In response, Rivera  has offered an  affidavit from\n\nan  Interagency   Coordinator  of  Human  Resources  for  the\n\nMunicipal   Government  of   San   Juan   stating  that   the\n\nreclassification was  appropriate.  She also  argues that she\n\nworked  for more than one year as an Executive Secretary III,\n\na position  two levels higher than Executive Secretary I, and\n\nthat she therefore  has satisfied  the required  one year  of\n\nexperience similar to that of Executive Secretary I.\n\n          Second, appellees contend  that Rivera's  promotion\n\nfrom Executive Secretary II to Executive Officer IV was  void\n\nbecause she did not have  the minimal qualifications for that\n\nposition.   Specifically, they assert  that she did  not meet\n\nthe   requirement  of  one   year  of  experience  performing\n\nfunctions  similar  to those  of  an  Executive Officer  III.\n\nRivera contends, however, that she did meet that requirement,\n\nand the record  is unclear  on this issue.   Thus, there  are\n\ngenuine  issues  of material  fact  with  respect to  whether\n\nRivera's  ascension  to  Executive Officer  IV  violated  the\n\npersonnel regulations, and the district court should not have\n\ngranted  appellees summary judgment  on Rivera's  due process\n\nclaim.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nII.  First Amendment\n                    \n\n          The  district court  concluded that  Rivera's First\n\nAmendment claim fails for two reasons.  First, it stated that\n\neven if Rivera  could show that  political affiliation was  a\n\n\"motivating factor\" in appellees' actions, appellees can show\n\nthat they would have demoted her regardless of  her political\n\naffiliation.  Rivera-Ruiz, No. 87-1592, slip. op. at 12.\n                         \n\n          On  appeal, appellees  concede that  Rivera carried\n\nher initial burden of  a prima facie showing that  appellees'\n\nconduct was politically motivated.  See Kaufmann, 841 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n1172.  She alleged that:   (1) she support the NPP,  and that\n\nappellees were PDP supporters;  (2) appellees gave the duties\n\nof her former position  to a specific PDP supporter;  and (3)\n\ntwo  other  employees  in  similar situations  who  were  PDP\n\nsupporters had not been demoted.\n\n          Appellees argue, however, that they then  met their\n\nburden  of production  by  offering a  legitimate reason  for\n\nRivera's  demotion:    she  held  the  Executive  Officer  IV\n\nposition in violation of the personnel regulations.  However,\n\nas discussed above, it  is unclear whether this justification\n\nis  supported  by the  record.    Indeed, genuine  issues  of\n\nmaterial fact exist  with respect to Rivera's  qualifications\n\nto hold this position.\n\n          The second reason that the district court  rejected\n\nRivera's First Amendment claim was that Rivera failed to meet\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nthe standard set out in Agosto-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  1209 (1st  Cir. 1989)  (holding  that actions  short of\n\ndismissal may violate employee's First Amendment rights,  but\n\nplacing restrictions on when they constitute such violation).\n\nWe  disagree.     Simply   put,  we  believe   that  Rivera's\n\nallegations, which  have not  been demonstrated to  be false,\n\ncould provide a sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable\n\nfactfinder to determine,  by clear  and convincing  evidence,\n\nthat  Rivera's current position  is \"unreasonably inferior to\n\nthe  norm,\" as that term is defined in Agosto-Feliciano.  See\n                                                             \n\nid  at 1218-20;  see also Rodriguez-Pinto  v. Tirado-Delgado,\n                                                            \n\nNo.  92-1648,  slip op.  at 9-13  (1st  Cir. Dec.    , 1992).\n\nMoreover,  we are  of the  opinion that  Rivera's allegations\n\nalso  are of such a nature that a reasonable factfinder could\n\nconclude by  a preponderance of the  evidence that appellees'\n\nactions  were motivated  by  discrimination on  the basis  of\n\npolitical  affiliation.   See  Agosto-Feliciano, 889  F.2d at\n                                               \n\n1220;  see   also  Rodriguez-Pinto,   slip   op.  at   11-13.\n                                  \n\nAccordingly, we find that the district  court should not have\n\ngranted   defendants  summary  judgment   on  Rivera's  First\n\nAmendment claim.1\n\n                    \n\n1.  There is  some question as to the  continuing vitality of\nAgosto-Feliciano in  light of  the Supreme Court's  ruling in\n                \nRutan  v.  Republican Party  of  Illinois,  110 S.  Ct.  2729\n                                         \n(1990).  See Rodriguez-Pinto,  slip op. at 18  (Torruella, J.\n                            \nconcurring).  Because we  conclude, however, that there exist\nsufficient genuine and material factual disputes to warrant a\ntrial  even under  the arguably  more stringent  standard set\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nIII.  Qualified Immunity\n                        \n\n          Appellees'  suggest  that as  government officials,\n\nthey  are  entitled to  qualified  immunity.   The  qualified\n\nimmunity defense does not rescue appellees in this case.\n\n          Qualified  immunity is  an affirmative  defense for\n\ngovernment officials sued for damages.  Domegan v.  Fair, 859\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  1059,  1063  (1st  Cir.  1988).    However,  government\n\nofficials  are not entitled  to this defense  if they violate\n\nclearly  established rights of  which a reasonable government\n\nofficial would have  known.  Harlow  v. Fitzgerald, 457  U.S.\n                                                  \n\n800, 818-19 (1982).\n\n          Because   some   portion   of  appellees'   conduct\n\nallegedly  occurred after  Agosto-Feliciano  and  Rutan  were\n                                                       \n\ndecided, said conduct, if deemed unconstitutional, would have\n\nviolated  clearly established  rights  about which  appellees\n\nshould  have  known.   Thus,  appellees are  not  entitled to\n\nqualified immunity with respect to those actions.2\n\n                    \n\nforth in Agosto-Feliciano, we do not reach this issue.\n                         \n\n2.  Of  course,  appellees   remain  entitled  to   qualified\nimmunity with respect  to any conduct that  occurred prior to\nthe  Agosto-Feliciano and  Rutan decisions.   See  Rodriguez-\n                                                             \nPinto, slip. op.,  at 7  (\"prior to our  decision in  Agosto-\n                                                             \nFeliciano  and  the  Supreme  Court's decision  in  Rutan  v.\n                                                         \nRepublican  Party of Illinois, 110 S.

Rivera, a  member of the  New Progressive Party\n\n(\"NPP\"),  worked at  an  agency of  Puerto Rico's  government\n\nCorporacion  de  Fomento  Recreativo  since 1971.    In  that\n\norganization,  she  held  the career  position  of  Executive\n\nOfficer IV since February 1, 1984. \n\n          In December 1986, appellees, members of the Popular\n\nDemocratic Party  (\"PDP\") took Rivera's job  duties away from\n\nher and reassigned them to a member of the  PDP.  On the 22nd\n\nof that month, appellees also reduced her monthly salary from\n\n$1,131 to $998.  On May 30, 1987, appellees demoted Rivera to\n\nExecutive  Secretary I,  which  carries a  monthly salary  of\n\n$995.\n\n          As  a  result  of  these   actions,  Rivera  became\n\nseverely  depressed, and on March 27, 1987, she was placed on\n\nrest  status at the State Insurance Fund.  Rivera remained on\n\nrest status  until the  State Insurance Fund  declared itself\n\n\"without jurisdiction because [Rivera's]  emotional condition\n\n[is] due to political  discrimination.\"  Subsequently, Rivera\n\nreceived private psychiatric care.\n\n          After receiving psychiatric  care, Rivera  reported\n\nback  to work, and appellees  sent her to  the agency's press\n\noffice  where she  was  assigned minimal  duties by  a former\n\nsubordinate.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          In  September 1990, appellees transferred Rivera to\n\na  division that did not  require her skills  as an Executive\n\nSecretary.  Moreover,  at that division, Rivera  had no desk,\n\ntypewriter, or office.   Rivera never  received a hearing  on\n\nany of these demotions or transfers.\n\n                        LEGAL ANALYSIS\n                                      \n\nI.

However, that\n   \n\nproperty  right is void  if the employee  acquired the career\n\nposition through a violation of the Puerto Rico Personnel Act\n\nor agency regulations promulgated under that Act.  Id.\n                                                     \n\n          No one disputes that Rivera held a career position.\n\nHowever,  appellees   contend  that  her  ascension   to  the\n\nExecutive Officer IV position  entailed two violations of the\n\nagency regulations.  First, they  argue that in October 1979,\n\nRivera  was  erroneously  reclassified  from  Secretary  V to\n\nExecutive Secretary  II.   Specifically, they state  that she\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ndid not perform functions  similar to those performed  in the\n\nExecutive  Secretary I position  for one year  as required by\n\nthe agency regulations.\n\n          In response, Rivera  has offered an  affidavit from\n\nan  Interagency   Coordinator  of  Human  Resources  for  the\n\nMunicipal   Government  of   San   Juan   stating  that   the\n\nreclassification was  appropriate.  She also  argues that she\n\nworked  for more than one year as an Executive Secretary III,\n\na position  two levels higher than Executive Secretary I, and\n\nthat she therefore  has satisfied  the required  one year  of\n\nexperience similar to that of Executive Secretary I.\n\n          Second, appellees contend  that Rivera's  promotion\n\nfrom Executive Secretary II to Executive Officer IV was  void\n\nbecause she did not have  the minimal qualifications for that\n\nposition.   Specifically, they assert  that she did  not meet\n\nthe   requirement  of  one   year  of  experience  performing\n\nfunctions  similar  to those  of  an  Executive Officer  III.\n\nRivera contends, however, that she did meet that requirement,\n\nand the record  is unclear  on this issue.   Thus, there  are\n\ngenuine  issues  of material  fact  with  respect to  whether\n\nRivera's  ascension  to  Executive Officer  IV  violated  the\n\npersonnel regulations, and the district court should not have\n\ngranted  appellees summary judgment  on Rivera's  due process\n\nclaim.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nII.  First Amendment\n                    \n\n          The  district court  concluded that  Rivera's First\n\nAmendment claim fails for two reasons.  First, it stated that\n\neven if Rivera  could show that  political affiliation was  a\n\n\"motivating factor\" in appellees' actions, appellees can show\n\nthat they would have demoted her regardless of  her political\n\naffiliation.  Rivera-Ruiz, No. 87-1592, slip. op. at 12.\n                         \n\n          On  appeal, appellees  concede that  Rivera carried\n\nher initial burden of  a prima facie showing that  appellees'\n\nconduct was politically motivated.  See Kaufmann, 841 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n1172.  She alleged that:   (1) she support the NPP,  and that\n\nappellees were PDP supporters;  (2) appellees gave the duties\n\nof her former position  to a specific PDP supporter;  and (3)\n\ntwo  other  employees  in  similar situations  who  were  PDP\n\nsupporters had not been demoted.\n\n          Appellees argue, however, that they then  met their\n\nburden  of production  by  offering a  legitimate reason  for\n\nRivera's  demotion:    she  held  the  Executive  Officer  IV\n\nposition in violation of the personnel regulations.  However,\n\nas discussed above, it  is unclear whether this justification\n\nis  supported  by the  record.    Indeed, genuine  issues  of\n\nmaterial fact exist  with respect to Rivera's  qualifications\n\nto hold this position.\n\n          The second reason that the district court  rejected\n\nRivera's First Amendment claim was that Rivera failed to meet\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nthe standard set out in Agosto-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532523\"><a href=\"/opinion/532523/maria-m-agosto-de-feliciano-v-awilda-aponte-roque-etc-maria-teresa/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span>\n                                                        \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st  Cir. 1989)  (holding  that actions  short of\n\ndismissal may violate employee's First Amendment rights,  but\n\nplacing restrictions on when they constitute such violation).\n\nWe  disagree.     Simply   put,  we  believe   that  Rivera's\n\nallegations, which  have not  been demonstrated to  be false,\n\ncould provide a sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable\n\nfactfinder to determine,  by clear  and convincing  evidence,\n\nthat  Rivera's current position  is \"unreasonably inferior to\n\nthe  norm,\" as that term is defined in Agosto-Feliciano.  See\n                                                             \n\nid  at 1218-20;  see also Rodriguez-Pinto  v.

Dec.    , 1992).\n\nMoreover,  we are  of the  opinion that  Rivera's allegations\n\nalso  are of such a nature that a reasonable factfinder could\n\nconclude by  a preponderance of the  evidence that appellees'\n\nactions  were motivated  by  discrimination on  the basis  of\n\npolitical  affiliation.   See  Agosto-Feliciano, 889  F.2d at\n                                               \n\n1220;  see   also  Rodriguez-Pinto,   slip   op.  at   11-13.\n                                  \n\nAccordingly, we find that the district  court should not have\n\ngranted   defendants  summary  judgment   on  Rivera's  First\n\nAmendment claim.1\n\n                    \n\n1.  There is  some question as to the  continuing vitality of\nAgosto-Feliciano in  light of  the Supreme Court's  ruling in\n                \nRutan  v.  Republican Party  of  Illinois,  110 S.
