The  appellant  committed\n\nviolations of both  21 U.S.C.    841 and 21  U.S.C.   960  in\n\nApril 1987.   His sentences  of 25 years  of imprisonment  on\n\neach of the four  counts, to be served concurrently,  and his\n\nsentences of  20  years  of supervised  release  on  the  two\n\nsubstantive counts, to be served concurrently, are lawful and\n\nhis arguments  to the contrary  are foreclosed by  the above-\n\ncited precedent.\n\n     Appellant appears  also to argue that  amendments to the\n\npenalty  provisions  of  21  U.S.C.       846  and  963  (the\n\ncoordinate  conspiracy provisions),  enacted on  November 18,\n\n1988, were unlawfully applied to him.  Even  if intended as a\n\nseparate argument,  however, we have  rejected it in  a prior\n\npost-conviction  appeal brought  by  one of  appellant's  co-\n\ndefendants.   United  States v.
