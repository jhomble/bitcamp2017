Tretter,\n                                                                 \nAssistant Corporation Counsel, on brief for appellees.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n     Per  Curiam.    Jimmy  Batiste  appeals pro  se  from  a\n                \n\ndistrict court  order dismissing his complaint  on the ground\n\nthat it was barred by  the applicable statute of limitations.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     In  December 1987,  Batiste was  arrested on  charges of\n\nassault  and battery  with a  dangerous weapon.    In January\n\n1989,  following  a  jury-waived  trial in  Boston  Municipal\n\nCourt, he was convicted  on one such count and  was sentenced\n\nto a thirty-month prison term, with one year to be served and\n\nwith   probation  to   run   through  January   1991.     The\n\nMassachusetts   Appeals   Court   summarily    affirmed   his\n\nconviction, see  Commonwealth v.  Batiste, 30 Mass.  App. Ct.\n                                         \n\n1113 (1991), and the Supreme Judicial Court thereafter denied\n\nfurther appellate review.\n\n     In  September 1993, plaintiff  filed the  instant civil-\n\nrights action for damages  under 42 U.S.C.   1983,  naming as\n\ndefendants the city of Boston, the mayor, the commissioner of\n\npolice,  and   seven  police  officers  (two   of  whom  were\n\nidentified  only by  badge number).    He there  alleged that\n\ndefendants  had  concealed  exculpatory information  and  had\n\nmanufactured other evidence in order to effectuate his arrest\n\nand  to  secure  his  wrongful conviction  at  trial--all  in\n\nviolation of his rights to due process, equal protection, and\n\na fair  trial.   More particularly,  he charged (among  other\n\nthings)  that  defendants  (1)  suppressed  a  police  report\n\nprepared by the officers who first arrived at the crime scene\n\nwhich  stated that  the victim  had refused  to identify  her\n\nassailant,  (2) fabricated a second police report purportedly\n\nobtained from the victim at  the hospital which named Batiste\n\nas the  assailant, and (3)  testified falsely with  regard to\n\nthese  facts  both at  the  probable  cause  hearing  and  at\n\ntrial.1\n\n     Prior  to  service  on  defendants,  the district  court\n\nreviewed the in forma pauperis complaint and dismissed it sua\n                                                             \n\nsponte  as frivolous under 28 U.S.C.   1915(d).  It concluded\n      \n\nthat the complaint, even  when construed liberally,  involved\n\nevents that had transpired more than three years prior to the\n\ndate of filing,  with the  result that the  action was  time-\n\nbarred.  Batiste now appeals.\n\n                             II.\n\n     \"We have squarely held that 'a complaint  which states a\n\nclaim  that  appears to  have  expired  under the  applicable\n\nstatute of  limitations may be dismissed  as frivolous' under\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  record before us does not reveal the extent to which\nany  other  evidence  of  Batiste's  guilt--apart  from  such\nallegedly falsified  reports and testimony--was  presented at\ntrial;  it  is  unclear,  for  example,  whether  the  victim\ntestified.   It  is likewise unclear  to what  extent Batiste\nraised  such allegations  of police  misconduct in  the state\ncourts.   He  states  only that  his  attorney was  aware  of\ndefendants' misconduct  but refused to challenge  it, that he\n(Batiste)  complained of  their  actions in  a  pro se  brief\nseparately  filed  on  appeal,  and  that  the  Massachusetts\nAppeals Court failed to address the issue.     \n\n                             -3-\n\nsection 1915(d).\"   Johnson v. Rodriguez,  943 F.2d 104,  107\n                                        \n\n(1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 948 (1992) (quoting\n                             \n\nStreet v. Vose, 936 F.2d 38, 39 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam),\n              \n\ncert.  denied, 112 S. Ct. 948 (1992)).   At the same time, in\n             \n\nlight  of the  truncated  procedures commonly  attending a   \n\n1915(d)  dismissal, we  have cautioned  that district  courts\n\nshould consider  issuing  an  order to  show  cause  in  such\n\ncircumstances in order to permit the plaintiff to demonstrate\n\nwhether any  tolling provisions might apply.  See Street, 936\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 41  n.5.   No such opportunity  was afforded  Batiste\n\nhere.  As a result, his arguments on appeal--in which he sets\n\nforth several  reasons why  the limitations period  should be\n\nextended--were   neither   raised   nor    addressed   below.\n\nNonetheless,   a  careful   review  of   Batiste's  appellate\n\nsubmissions, along with his complaint, permits us to conclude\n\nthat his contentions are misplaced.\n\n     It is  undisputed  that the  instant    1983  action  is\n\nsubject  to the  three-year limitations period  prescribed by\n\nMass.  G.L. c. 260,   2A (along  with any state tolling rules\n\nnot at odds with federal  law).  See, e.g., Street, 936  F.2d\n                                                  \n\nat 39-40.  It is likewise  agreed that the question of when a\n\ncause of  action accrues  remains  a matter  of federal  law.\n\nSee,  e.g., Rodriguez Narvaez v. Nazario, 895 F.2d 38, 41 n.5\n                                        \n\n(1st  Cir.  1990).    Batiste  filed  his  complaint here  on\n\nSeptember 7, 1993--well  over three years after the events of\n\n                             -4-\n\nwhich  he  complains.2    In  an   attempt  to  sidestep  the\n\nlimitations bar,  he advances  two contentions: (1)  that his\n\nwrongful   conviction   and   incarceration   constituted   a\n\ncontinuing  wrong  which persisted  through  the  end of  his\n\nprobation  on January 9, 1991, with the result that his cause\n\nof action did  not accrue until that  date; and (2) that  the\n\nlimitations  period should  be  extended  because  defendants\n\nconcealed  relevant  information.    Neither  argument proves\n\npersuasive. \n\n     As to the former, we need not decide the extent to which\n\nthe \"continuing violation\"  doctrine--an equitable  principle\n\nmost  often invoked  in  the Title  VII  context, see,  e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nJohnson, 943 F.2d  at 107-08--might apply  to   1983  claims.\n       \n\nSee generally Hunt v.  Bennett,     F.3d    , 1994  WL 47751,\n                              \n\nat  *2 (10th  Cir.  1994).    Even  if  this  principle  were\n\notherwise  applicable,  Batiste's  argument   overlooks  \"the\n\n'critical  distinction'  between  a  continuing  act  and   a\n\nsingular  act   that  brings  continuing   consequences\"  for\n\npurposes  of  the limitations  period.   Gilbert  v.  City of\n                                                             \n\nCambridge, 932 F.2d  51, 58-59 (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 112\n                                                        \n\nS. Ct. 192  (1991) (quoted in Johnson, 943 F.2d  at 108).  It\n                                     \n\nhas been specifically held  that, where an individual alleges\n\nto have been wrongfully  incarcerated because of false arrest\n\n                    \n\n2.  As mentioned,  his arrest  occurred in December  1987 and\nhis three-day trial took place in January 1989.  \n\n                             -5-\n\nor   some   other  tortious   activity,   such  incarceration\n\nconstitutes   a  continuing  ill   effect  from  the  earlier\n\nmisconduct rather  than a continuing  tort in and  of itself.\n\nSee, e.g., McCune v. City of Grand Rapids, 842 F.2d  903, 906\n                                         \n\n(6th Cir. 1988); Sandutch  v. Muroski, 684 F.2d 252,  254 (3d\n                                     \n\nCir. 1982); cf. Street, 936 F.2d at 40-41 &amp; n.4 (noting that,\n                      \n\nunder a  1987 Massachusetts  statute, imprisonment  no longer\n\ntolls the statute of limitations--a legislative judgment \"not\n\ninconsistent with federal policy\").\n\n     Batiste's second  argument rests on  firmer legal ground\n\nbut is  devoid of factual  support.   He is correct  that the\n\naccrual period  in a    1983 case does  not start  until \"the\n\nplaintiff  knows, or  has reason  to know,  of the  injury on\n\nwhich  the  action is  based.\"    Rivera-Muriente v.  Agosto-\n                                                             \n\nAlicea,  959 F.2d  349,  353 (1st  Cir. 1992);  accord, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nTorres v. Superintendent  of Police, 893  F.2d 404, 407  (1st\n                                   \n\nCir. 1990).    He is  likewise correct  that the  limitations\n\nperiod may  be equitably tolled  where a plaintiff  \"can show\n\n'excusable ignorance' of the statute of limitations caused by\n\nsome  misconduct of the  defendant[s].\"  Id.  at 407; accord,\n                                                            \n\ne.g., Puritan  Med. Center, Inc.  v. Cashman, 413  Mass. 167,\n                                            \n\n175  (1992) (applying Mass.

App. Ct. 919, 920 (1992)\n                         \n\n(tolling may apply where defendant \"encourages or cajoles the\n\npotential plaintiff into inaction\").  Yet Batiste has made no\n\n                             -6-\n\nfactual   allegations  that   would  warrant   extending  the\n\nlimitations  period.  He  complains in this  regard only that\n\nthe police  department refused  to divulge  the names  of the\n\nofficers responding to  the crime  scene.

He acknowledges, however,  that by the\n\ntime of his  trial in January 1989, he knew  that he had been\n\narrested  \"without   a  warrant\"  and  that   defendants  had\n\n\"misrepresented  and concealed material  facts actually known\n\nto them  to a state court  judge.\"  Brief at  9; accord Reply\n                                                       \n\nBrief at 4, 6 n.1.  \n\n     Such knowledge was sufficient  to trigger the running of\n\nthe  limitations period.3   See,  e.g., Compton  v. Ide,  732\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 1429, 1433 (9th Cir. 1984) (\"When a plaintiff has notice\n\nof  wrongful  conduct,  it  is not  necessary  that  he  have\n\nknowledge of all the  details or all of the  persons involved\n\nin order for  his cause  of action to  accrue.\"); Messere  v.\n                                                         \n\nMurphy,  32 Mass.

On the other hand,  to the extent Batiste's  complaint is\nconstrued  as setting  forth  a    1983  claim for  malicious\nprosecution, his action  is arguably premature.  It  has been\nheld that such a  claim does not accrue until  the underlying\ncriminal proceedings have terminated  in favor of the accused\n(which is an element of the offense  of malicious prosecution\nat  common law).   See,  e.g., Brummett  v. Camble,  946 F.2d\n                                                  \n1178,  1183-84 (5th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 2323\n                                            \n(1992).  The  criminal proceedings here, of  course, have not\nterminated  in  Batiste's  favor.   We  need  not now  decide\nwhether,  in the event such  a development were  to occur, he\nmight   then  be  able  to  advance  a  claim  for  malicious\nprosecution.  \n\n                             -7-\n\nconspired  to  conceal  evidence,  give false  testimony  and\n\nintimidate    witnesses,    \"plaintiff's   criminal    trial,\n\nconviction, and incarceration certainly were events likely to\n\nput him on notice of the alleged wrongs\") (internal quotation\n\nomitted).    Similarly,  Batiste's  allegations   provide  no\n\nplausible basis for invoking  the equitable tolling doctrine.\n\nThe police department, simply  because of its alleged refusal\n\nto  identify  certain  officers,   cannot  be  said  to  have\n\n\"actively misle[d]\" Batiste in any fashion.

At the same time, in light of the truncated procedures commonly attending a Sec. 1915(d) dismissal, we have cautioned that district courts should consider issuing an order to show cause in such circumstances in order to permit the plaintiff to demonstrate whether any tolling provisions might apply.  See Street, 936 F.2d at 41 n. 5. No such opportunity was afforded Batiste here.  As a result, his arguments on appeal-in which he sets forth several reasons why the limitations period should be extended-were neither raised nor addressed below.

It is likewise agreed that the question of when a cause of action accrues remains a matter of federal law.   See, e.g., Rodriguez Narvaez v. Nazario, 895 F.2d 38, 41 n. 5 (1st Cir. 1990).  Batiste filed his complaint here on September 7, 1993-well over three years after the events of which he complains.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In an attempt to sidestep the limitations bar, he advances two contentions:  (1) that his wrongful conviction and incarceration constituted a continuing wrong which persisted through the end of his probation on January 9, 1991, with the result that his cause of action did not accrue until that date;  and (2) that the limitations period should be extended because defendants concealed relevant information.

See generally Hunt v. Bennett,  F.3d , 1994 WL 47751, at * 2 (10th Cir. 1994).  Even if this principle were otherwise applicable, Batiste's argument overlooks \"the 'critical distinction' between a continuing act and a singular act that brings continuing consequences\" for purposes of the limitations period.

It has been specifically held that, where an individual alleges to have been wrongfully incarcerated because of false arrest or some other tortious activity, such incarceration constitutes a continuing ill effect from the earlier misconduct rather than a continuing tort in and of itself.   See, e.g., McCune v. City of Grand Rapids, 842 F.2d 903, 906 (6th Cir. 1988);   Sandutch v. Muroski, 684 F.2d 252, 254 (3d Cir. 1982);   cf.  Street, 936 F.2d at 40-41 &amp; n. 4 (noting that, under a 1987 Massachusetts statute, imprisonment no longer tolls the statute of limitations-a legislative judgment \"not inconsistent with federal policy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Batiste's second argument rests on firmer legal ground but is devoid of factual support.

Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 353 (1st Cir. 1992);   accord, e.g., Torres v. Superintendent of Police, 893 F.2d 404, 407 (1st Cir. 1990).  He is likewise correct that the limitations period may be equitably tolled where a plaintiff \"can show 'excusable ignorance' of the statute of limitations caused by some misconduct of the defendant[s].\"   Id. at 407;   accord, e.g., Puritan Med.  Center, Inc. v. Cashman, 413 Mass. 167, 175 (1992) (applying Mass.  G.L. c. 260, Sec. 12);   Cherella v. Phoenix Technologies Ltd., 32 Mass.  App. Ct. 919, 920 (1992) (tolling may apply where defendant \"encourages or cajoles the potential plaintiff into inaction\").  Yet Batiste has made no factual allegations that would warrant extending the limitations period.  He complains in this regard only that the police department refused to divulge the names of the officers responding to the crime scene.  See Brief at 10;  Reply Brief at 4-6.  He acknowledges, however, that by the time of his trial in January 1989, he knew that he had been arrested \"without a warrant\" and that defendants had \"misrepresented and concealed material facts actually known to them to a state court judge.\"  Brief at 9;  accord Reply Brief at 4, 6 n. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such knowledge was sufficient to trigger the running of the limitations period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>   See, e.g., Compton v.

Similarly, Batiste's allegations provide no plausible basis for invoking the equitable tolling doctrine.  The police department, simply because of its alleged refusal to identify certain officers, cannot be said to have \"actively misle[d]\" Batiste in any fashion.

In January 1989, following a jury-waived trial in Boston Municipal Court, he was convicted on one such count and was sentenced to a thirty-month prison term, with one year to be served and with probation to run through January 1991.  The Massachusetts Appeals Court summarily affirmed his conviction, see Commonwealth v. Batiste, 30 Mass.  App. Ct. 1113 (1991), and the Supreme Judicial Court thereafter denied further appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1993, plaintiff filed the instant civil- rights action for damages under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, naming as defendants the city of Boston, the mayor, the commissioner of police, and seven police officers (two of whom were identified only by badge number).  He there alleged that defendants had concealed exculpatory information and had manufactured other evidence in order to effectuate his arrest and to secure his wrongful conviction at trial-all in violation of his rights to due process, equal protection, and a fair trial.  More particularly, he charged (among other things) that defendants (1) suppressed a police report prepared by the officers who first arrived at the crime scene which stated that the victim had refused to identify her assailant, (2) fabricated a second police report purportedly obtained from the victim at the hospital which named Batiste as the assailant, and (3) testified falsely with regard to these facts both at the probable cause hearing and at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to service on defendants, the district court reviewed the in forma pauperis complaint and dismissed it sua sponte as frivolous under 28 U.S.C.
