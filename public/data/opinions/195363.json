Because we answer this question in\n\nthe negative, we affirm the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment for the defendant.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          The  following facts  are  undisputed.   Plaintiff-\n\nappellant,  Vulcan  Tools of  Puerto  Rico,  Inc., sells  and\n\nservices  power tools  manufactured  by  a Japanese  company,\n\nMakita Corp.   Vulcan  has distributed Makita  products since\n\nMay 1983,  when it entered into  a non-exclusive distribution\n\ncontract   with   defendant-appellee,  Makita   U.S.A.,  Inc.\n\n(\"Makita\"), a subsidiary of its Japanese parent.\n\n          At   the   time  Vulcan   became   a  non-exclusive\n\ndistributor for  Makita, the  latter already had  three other\n\nnon-exclusive distributors operating in Puerto Rico.  In 1988\n\nMakita appointed  a sales  representative in Puerto  Rico and\n\nauthorized      thirty-four     additional      non-exclusive\n\ndistributorships on the island.  Vulcan continued to sell and\n\nservice Makita tools.   While the sale of Makita  products in\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nPuerto Rico has more than tripled  since 1988, Vulcan's total\n\nsales of the same and its market share have fallen.\n\n          In February  1989 Vulcan  filed this action  in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto  Rico\n\nalleging that Makita had  impaired the existing  relationship\n\nbetween the  parties without just  cause in violation  of Law\n\n75.   The district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nMakita.  This appeal ensued.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          On appeal Vulcan argues (1) that the district court\n\nabused  its discretion  in entertaining  Makita's  motion for\n\nsummary  judgment,   and  (2)   that  summary   judgment  was\n\nimprovidently  granted  because  whether  Makita's  hiring of\n\nthirty-four additional  distributors in Puerto  Rico impaired\n\nMakita's  established relationship with  Vulcan is a disputed\n\nquestion of material fact.1\n\n                    \n\n1.    In  the  complaint,  Vulcan  also  alleged that  Makita\nviolated Law 75  by (1) appointing a sales  representative in\nPuerto Rico and (2) allowing the importation into Puerto Rico\nof Makita power  tools  that did not   meet the  requirements\nof the Occupational Safety and  Health Act (\"OSHA\").   Vulcan\ndid not, with  respect to the  former claim, contest  summary\njudgment below, and has  not pressed either of the  claims on\nthis court.   Consequently, they have been  waived on appeal.\nGamma Audio &amp;  Video, Inc.  v. Ean-Chea, 11  F.3d 1106,  1113\n                                       \n(1st  Cir. 1993) (issues that  surface for the  first time on\nappeal  or are raised in  a perfunctory manner  on appeal are\ndeemed waived).\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nA.  Timeliness of Makita's Summary Judgment Motion\n                                                  \n\n          On  November 4, 1991  the Magistrate Judge assigned\n\nto the case issued a \"Final Pretrial Conference Report\" which\n\nestablished  December 15,  1991  as the  date for  completing\n\noutstanding discovery,  and December  30 as the  deadline for\n\nfiling dispositive motions.  Vulcan argues on appeal the same\n\nargument rejected  below:   that because Makita's  motion for\n\nsummary judgment  was  not filed  until August  3, 1993,  the\n\nmotion was untimely, and  the district court was barred  from\n\nconsidering it under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b) and 16(e).2\n\n          Because trial  judges must  be able to  control the\n\nmanagement  of  their cases,  we  review  a district  court's\n\ndecision to modify a pretrial scheduling order under an abuse\n\nof discretion standard.  See Anda v. Ralston Purina, Co., 959\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1149, 1155 (1st Cir. 1992); In re San Juan  Dupont Plaza\n                                                             \n\nHotel  Fire Litigation, 859 F.2d  1007, 1020 (1st Cir. 1988);\n                      \n\nsee  also Ramirez Pomales v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., 839 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 1988) (decision to modify a pretrial order  is\n\nsubject to the trial court's discretion).  Moreover, pretrial\n\norders  are to be  liberally construed, James  W.M. Moore, et\n\n                    \n\n2.  Rule 16(b) instructs district courts to enter  scheduling\norders  limiting the time  to, inter  alia, file  motions and\n                                          \ncomplete discovery.  Under this rule, \"[a] schedule shall not\nbe modified except upon  a showing of good cause and by leave\nof the district judge or, when authorized by local rule, by a\nmagistrate judge.\"   Rule 16(e) provides,  in pertinent part,\nthat  once a  pretrial  order is  entered,  it \"controls  the\nsubsequent  course  of  the  action,  unless  modified  by  a\nsubsequent order.\"\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nal.,  Moore's  Federal Practice,    16.19,  at 16-90  (2d ed.\n                               \n\n1993) (citing cases).  Thus we are loathe to upset a district\n\ncourt's  interpretation  of  its  own order.    See  Martha's\n                                                             \n\nVineyard  Scuba HQ.  v. Unidentified  Vessel, 833  F.2d 1059,\n                                            \n\n1066-67  (1st  Cir.  1987) (citing  cases)  (recognizing \"the\n\nspecial  role played by the writing  judge in elucidating the\n\nmeaning and intendment of an order which he authored\").\n\n          The district court determined that the deadline for\n\nfiling  dispositive motions  established in  the magistrate's\n\norder was vacated by  a subsequent order issued by  the court\n\nin which no such  deadline was set, and that  Makita's motion\n\nwas therefore not  untimely.   The sequence of  events is  as\n\nfollows.   In  March 1992 Vulcan  moved to have  a trial date\n\nset.   Makita objected on  the ground  that the case  was not\n\nready for trial, in part, because Vulcan had not responded to\n\nvarious document  requests  and the  deposition  of  Vulcan's\n\nPresident, Joseph Fayer, had not yet concluded.  On April 27,\n\n1992, in response to  Makita's objections, the district court\n\ngranted   Vulcan   additional  time   to   produce  specified\n\ndocuments, set  deadlines  for various  depositions,  ordered\n\nthat discovery  be completed by  June 30, 1992,  and referred\n\nthe  case to  the  magistrate  judge  for the  scheduling  of\n\nanother  pretrial conference.   The court  further instructed\n\nthe  parties  to submit  a  revised  proposed final  pretrial\n\norder.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          The  parties  submitted a  proposed  final pretrial\n\norder in August  1992, which  was approved by  the court  six\n\ndays later.  Neither that order nor the April 27 order, set a\n\ndeadline for filing dispositive  motions.  The district court\n\nviewed  its decision  to  reopen discovery  as vitiating  the\n\nexisting  deadline for  the  filing  of dispositive  motions.\n\nVulcan Tools of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Makita U.S.A., Inc., No.\n                                                        \n\n89-148, slip op. at  6 (D.P.R. Sept. 1,  1993).  Because  the\n\noriginal cut-off  date  for filing  dispositive motions  fell\n\nafter the  original discovery deadline,  the court's  finding\n\nthat  a change in the latter necessarily abolished the former\n\nis  eminently reasonable.  While  it is true  that Makita did\n\nnot specifically request  an extension of  time for filing  a\n\nmotion for  summary judgment, the court  could have concluded\n\nthat the  \"good cause\" Makita demonstrated  for extending the\n\ndiscovery  deadline  was  also  good cause  for  lifting  the\n\ndeadline for filing dispositive motions.  We find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in  the  court's  decision  to  consider  Makita's\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\nB.  Law 75\n          \n\n          We  now  turn  to  the principal  issue  raised  on\n\nappeal.      Vulcan   argues   that  summary   judgment   was\n\ninappropriate because whether Makita's appointment of thirty-\n\nfour additional  distributors caused a  \"detriment\" to Vulcan\n\n(i.e., the  subsequent decline  in Vulcan's sales  and market\n     \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nshare with respect to Makita products), is a question of fact\n\nfor the  jury.   Vulcan apparently concedes  that, under  the\n\nparties'  contract, Makita  was  entitled to  name additional\n\nnon-exclusive  distributors at  will, so long  as it  did not\n\nviolate Law 75.\n\n          We say  \"apparently,\" because  Vulcan has  sent out\n\nmixed messages.   Although it has  made the above  concession\n\nboth  in  its brief,  Appellant's Brief  at  21, and  in oral\n                                       \n\nargument, at  times  during oral  argument Vulcan  maintained\n\nthat, as part of its distribution  contract, Makita agreed to\n\nlimit the  number of  Makita distributors in  Puerto Rico  to\n\nthree.   Even if this argument has been properly preserved by\n\nVulcan, it is without merit.\n\n          The terms of Vulcan's non-exclusive distributorship\n\nare set forth  in a May  26, 1993 letter from  Carl Schwinne,\n\nMakita's  marketing  manager,   to  Joseph  Fayer,   Vulcan's\n\npresident.  The letter states:   \"This letter will  summarize\n\nour  phone  conversation   today  regarding  a  non-exclusive\n\ndistributorship for Makita power tools in  Puerto Rico.\"  The\n\nletter also  contains information  about Makita's  tool order\n\nprogram,   payment   terms,   stock   adjustments,   Makita's\n\nadvertising  program,  and warranty  repairs.    Vulcan never\n\nobjected to the  contractual terms  set forth in  the May  26\n\nletter.   Vulcan's argument that  Makita agreed  not to  have\n\nmore than three other distributors in Puerto Rico is based on\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\na  conversation that took place  on May 18  between Fayer and\n\nFrank  Isaacs,  then Makita's  regional  sales  manager.   As\n\nevidence   of  such   limitations,  Vulcan   offered  Isaacs'\n\ndeposition, at which Isaacs testified as follows:\n\n          Q.   All right.  Getting back to the\n               agreement  with Vulcan,  as for\n               the    setting   up    of   the\n               distributorship,  did   you  or\n               anyone at Makita,  to the  best\n               of    your     knowledge    and\n               recollection, ever  indicate to\n               Mr.  Fayer  that  Makita  would\n               operate  through  only  two  or\n               three   distributors   in   the\n               market.\n\n          A.   Yes.   I  stated that  right up\n               front that we  -- on our  visit\n               to him  -- went and  said these\n               are the people -- These are the\n               channels  of  distribution that\n               we're  looking  at.   These are\n               the  distributors   that  we're\n               going   to   try  to   sell  to\n               accomplish  our   objective  in\n               this  market, and if  -- and we\n               told this to each one.   If you\n               support our  programs, grow our\n               business here, in an acceptable\n               rate,  whatever that  might be,\n               then we see no reason to pursue\n               any other distributors in these\n               channels.\n\n          Q.   At that time they didn't  see a\n               need for that?\n\n          A.   That's right.\n\n          Q.   But that could change?\n\n          A.   Sure it can.\n\n          Q.   And the company wanted  to make\n               sure that it retained the right\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n               to    name    others,     other\n               distributors?\n\n          A.   Sure.  You  always retain  that\n               right, but if  you change  your\n               strategy  in  the  marketplace,\n               you    need    to   let    your\n               distributors know what that is.\n\nIsaacs' Deposition at 71-72.\n\n          The  law  of Puerto  Rico  is  clear  that no  oral\n\nextrinsic evidence may be admitted to add to, alter or modify\n\na written agreement except when fraud or surprise is alleged.\n\nP.R.

Although  the\n          application  of  these rules  will affect\n          the  admissibility  of certain  evidence,\n          they in reality  serve substantive  state\n          policies regulating private transactions.\n\nMcInnis v.

Because the  legislature  of  Puerto Rico  considered\n\ntraditional  principles  of   contract  law  insufficient  to\n\nprotect  the rights of dealers, it passed Law 75 to safeguard\n\nthese rights  and stabilize dealership relationships.

This argument is premised upon Vulcan's assumption that\n\nif  (1) caused (2), then there has  been a \"detriment\" to the\n\nparties'  \"established relationship,\"  and  Makita is  liable\n\nunder  Law 75 absent a showing of just cause for its actions.\n\nFor  the reasons set  forth below, we  disagree with Vulcan's\n\nassumption.\n\n          It  is beyond cavil that non-exclusive distributors\n\nare entitled to protection under Law  75.

This  spin  on   Law  75  is\n\nunprecedented, and wholly unsupported by any legal authority.\n\nNot  only  would Vulcan's  interpretation  of  the Act  grant\n\nvirtual  monopoly  status  to  every  supplier's  first  non-\n\nexclusive distributor  in Puerto  Rico, it  would effectively\n\nprevent suppliers from raising prices, even when such a right\n\nis secured by  contract, where  doing so would  cut into  the\n\ndistributor's  sales or  profits.

Because we answer this question in\n\nthe negative, we affirm the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment for the defendant.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          The  following facts  are  undisputed.   Plaintiff-\n\nappellant,  Vulcan  Tools of  Puerto  Rico,  Inc., sells  and\n\nservices  power tools  manufactured  by  a Japanese  company,\n\nMakita Corp.   Vulcan  has distributed Makita  products since\n\nMay 1983,  when it entered into  a non-exclusive distribution\n\ncontract   with   defendant-appellee,  Makita   U.S.A.,  Inc.\n\n(\"Makita\"), a subsidiary of its Japanese parent.\n\n          At   the   time  Vulcan   became   a  non-exclusive\n\ndistributor for  Makita, the  latter already had  three other\n\nnon-exclusive distributors operating in Puerto Rico.  In 1988\n\nMakita appointed  a sales  representative in Puerto  Rico and\n\nauthorized      thirty-four     additional      non-exclusive\n\ndistributorships on the island.  Vulcan continued to sell and\n\nservice Makita tools.   While the sale of Makita  products in\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nPuerto Rico has more than tripled  since 1988, Vulcan's total\n\nsales of the same and its market share have fallen.\n\n          In February  1989 Vulcan  filed this action  in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto  Rico\n\nalleging that Makita had  impaired the existing  relationship\n\nbetween the  parties without just  cause in violation  of Law\n\n75.   The district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nMakita.  This appeal ensued.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          On appeal Vulcan argues (1) that the district court\n\nabused  its discretion  in entertaining  Makita's  motion for\n\nsummary  judgment,   and  (2)   that  summary   judgment  was\n\nimprovidently  granted  because  whether  Makita's  hiring of\n\nthirty-four additional  distributors in Puerto  Rico impaired\n\nMakita's  established relationship with  Vulcan is a disputed\n\nquestion of material fact.1\n\n                    \n\n1.    In  the  complaint,  Vulcan  also  alleged that  Makita\nviolated Law 75  by (1) appointing a sales  representative in\nPuerto Rico and (2) allowing the importation into Puerto Rico\nof Makita power  tools  that did not   meet the  requirements\nof the Occupational Safety and  Health Act (\"OSHA\").   Vulcan\ndid not, with  respect to the  former claim, contest  summary\njudgment below, and has  not pressed either of the  claims on\nthis court.   Consequently, they have been  waived on appeal.\nGamma Audio &amp;  Video, Inc.  v.

Vulcan argues on appeal the same\n\nargument rejected  below:   that because Makita's  motion for\n\nsummary judgment  was  not filed  until August  3, 1993,  the\n\nmotion was untimely, and  the district court was barred  from\n\nconsidering it under Fed.

The sequence of  events is  as\n\nfollows.   In  March 1992 Vulcan  moved to have  a trial date\n\nset.   Makita objected on  the ground  that the case  was not\n\nready for trial, in part, because Vulcan had not responded to\n\nvarious document  requests  and the  deposition  of  Vulcan's\n\nPresident, Joseph Fayer, had not yet concluded.  On April 27,\n\n1992, in response to  Makita's objections, the district court\n\ngranted   Vulcan   additional  time   to   produce  specified\n\ndocuments, set  deadlines  for various  depositions,  ordered\n\nthat discovery  be completed by  June 30, 1992,  and referred\n\nthe  case to  the  magistrate  judge  for the  scheduling  of\n\nanother  pretrial conference.   The court  further instructed\n\nthe  parties  to submit  a  revised  proposed final  pretrial\n\norder.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          The  parties  submitted a  proposed  final pretrial\n\norder in August  1992, which  was approved by  the court  six\n\ndays later.  Neither that order nor the April 27 order, set a\n\ndeadline for filing dispositive  motions.  The district court\n\nviewed  its decision  to  reopen discovery  as vitiating  the\n\nexisting  deadline for  the  filing  of dispositive  motions.\n\nVulcan Tools of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Makita U.S.A., Inc., No.\n                                                        \n\n89-148, slip op. at  6 (D.P.R. Sept. 1,  1993).  Because  the\n\noriginal cut-off  date  for filing  dispositive motions  fell\n\nafter the  original discovery deadline,  the court's  finding\n\nthat  a change in the latter necessarily abolished the former\n\nis  eminently reasonable.  While  it is true  that Makita did\n\nnot specifically request  an extension of  time for filing  a\n\nmotion for  summary judgment, the court  could have concluded\n\nthat the  \"good cause\" Makita demonstrated  for extending the\n\ndiscovery  deadline  was  also  good cause  for  lifting  the\n\ndeadline for filing dispositive motions.  We find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in  the  court's  decision  to  consider  Makita's\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\nB.  Law 75\n          \n\n          We  now  turn  to  the principal  issue  raised  on\n\nappeal.      Vulcan   argues   that  summary   judgment   was\n\ninappropriate because whether Makita's appointment of thirty-\n\nfour additional  distributors caused a  \"detriment\" to Vulcan\n\n(i.e., the  subsequent decline  in Vulcan's sales  and market\n     \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nshare with respect to Makita products), is a question of fact\n\nfor the  jury.   Vulcan apparently concedes  that, under  the\n\nparties'  contract, Makita  was  entitled to  name additional\n\nnon-exclusive  distributors at  will, so long  as it  did not\n\nviolate Law 75.\n\n          We say  \"apparently,\" because  Vulcan has  sent out\n\nmixed messages.   Although it has  made the above  concession\n\nboth  in  its brief,  Appellant's Brief  at  21, and  in oral\n                                       \n\nargument, at  times  during oral  argument Vulcan  maintained\n\nthat, as part of its distribution  contract, Makita agreed to\n\nlimit the  number of  Makita distributors in  Puerto Rico  to\n\nthree.   Even if this argument has been properly preserved by\n\nVulcan, it is without merit.\n\n          The terms of Vulcan's non-exclusive distributorship\n\nare set forth  in a May  26, 1993 letter from  Carl Schwinne,\n\nMakita's  marketing  manager,   to  Joseph  Fayer,   Vulcan's\n\npresident.  The letter states:   \"This letter will  summarize\n\nour  phone  conversation   today  regarding  a  non-exclusive\n\ndistributorship for Makita power tools in  Puerto Rico.\"  The\n\nletter also  contains information  about Makita's  tool order\n\nprogram,   payment   terms,   stock   adjustments,   Makita's\n\nadvertising  program,  and warranty  repairs.    Vulcan never\n\nobjected to the  contractual terms  set forth in  the May  26\n\nletter.   Vulcan's argument that  Makita agreed  not to  have\n\nmore than three other distributors in Puerto Rico is based on\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\na  conversation that took place  on May 18  between Fayer and\n\nFrank  Isaacs,  then Makita's  regional  sales  manager.   As\n\nevidence   of  such   limitations,  Vulcan   offered  Isaacs'\n\ndeposition, at which Isaacs testified as follows:\n\n          Q.   All right.  Getting back to the\n               agreement  with Vulcan,  as for\n               the    setting   up    of   the\n               distributorship,  did   you  or\n               anyone at Makita,  to the  best\n               of    your     knowledge    and\n               recollection, ever  indicate to\n               Mr.  Fayer  that  Makita  would\n               operate  through  only  two  or\n               three   distributors   in   the\n               market.\n\n          A.   Yes.   I  stated that  right up\n               front that we  -- on our  visit\n               to him  -- went and  said these\n               are the people -- These are the\n               channels  of  distribution that\n               we're  looking  at.   These are\n               the  distributors   that  we're\n               going   to   try  to   sell  to\n               accomplish  our   objective  in\n               this  market, and if  -- and we\n               told this to each one.   If you\n               support our  programs, grow our\n               business here, in an acceptable\n               rate,  whatever that  might be,\n               then we see no reason to pursue\n               any other distributors in these\n               channels.\n\n          Q.   At that time they didn't  see a\n               need for that?\n\n          A.   That's right.\n\n          Q.   But that could change?\n\n          A.   Sure it can.\n\n          Q.   And the company wanted  to make\n               sure that it retained the right\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n               to    name    others,     other\n               distributors?\n\n          A.   Sure.  You  always retain  that\n               right, but if  you change  your\n               strategy  in  the  marketplace,\n               you    need    to   let    your\n               distributors know what that is.\n\nIsaacs' Deposition at 71-72.\n\n          The  law  of Puerto  Rico  is  clear  that no  oral\n\nextrinsic evidence may be admitted to add to, alter or modify\n\na written agreement except when fraud or surprise is alleged.\n\nP.R.

Where, as  is the case here, a dealer's\n\ncontractually acquired  rights have not been  impaired in any\n\nway, Law 75 does not come into play.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.\n                                                Affirmed.\n                                                         \n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n</pre>",
