Appellant Gary  Chirichiello appeals  the\n                \n\ndenial  by  the district  court  of  his motion  to  suppress\n\nevidence  which  led  to  his  indictment  for  manufacturing\n\nmarijuana  in  violation  of  21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1).    The\n\nevidence was  seized pursuant to  a warrant which  itself was\n\nbased  on  information  acquired during  a  prior warrantless\n\nsearch of a  residence in Landaff, New Hampshire.   The prior\n\nsearch was  undertaken by a  New Hampshire state  trooper who\n\nwas admitted to the residence  by an informant who claimed to\n\nhave   been  helping  Chirichiello   grow  marijuana  in  the\n\nresidence.  Chirichiello  later pled guilty but  reserved his\n\nright  to appeal the  denial of his  motion to suppress.   We\n\naffirm.\n\n                          Discussion\n\n     The  court  supportably   made  the  following   factual\n\nfindings.   In July  1992, New Hampshire  State Trooper Susan\n\nForey  was told  by  an informant,  Robert  Anthony, who  had\n\npreviously provided Forey with reliable information, that  he\n\ncould  bring  her to  a  residence  where  he was  an  active\n\nparticipant  in a  conspiracy to  grow  marijuana along  with\n\nChirichiello and  two other  individuals.   Anthony indicated\n\nthat his role was to provide advice as to the growing  of the\n\nplants and to care for them on a regular  basis.  He told the\n\ntrooper that the plants were  kept on the second floor behind\n\na door  secured by  a combination lock.   Anthony  told Forey\n\n                             -2-\n\nthat,  although he  did  not  reside in  the  house,1 he  had\n\naccess to and use  of the kitchen and  bathroom on a  regular\n\nbasis.  He also indicated that he had access to the marijuana\n\nplants on the second floor  and had an ongoing involvement in\n\ntending  the  plants,  which  included  caring  for  them  in\n\nChirichiello's absence.  While he did not have his own key to\n\nthe residence,  Anthony said that  he had access to  a common\n\nkey kept above  the door and that he knew  the combination of\n\nthe lock to the second floor.    \n\n     Upon arriving at the residence, Forey  made observations\n\nwhich  supported  the  accuracy  of  Anthony's   information.\n\nAnthony then  retrieved the key  and opened the door.   After\n\ngiving Forey a brief tour of the premises, during which Forey\n\nobserved manuals on how to grow marijuana, Anthony led her to\n\nthe  second  floor  where he  unlocked  the  combination lock\n\nbehind which  the marijuana  was being grown.   Based  on her\n\nobservations,  Forey  obtained  a  search  warrant   for  the\n\npremises.  \n\n     A party with common authority over a premise may consent\n\nto its  search.  United States v.  Matlock, 415 U.S. 164, 170\n                                          \n\n(1974).  Common authority exists where there is \n\n                    \n\n1.  Anthony claimed that  he slept in a tent  in the backyard\nbecause he did not  want to be caught in the  house where the\nmarijuana was  being grown.   He had previously lived  in the\nhouse.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     mutual  use of  the property  by persons  generally\n\n     having joint access  or control for most  purposes,\n\n     so that  it is reasonable to recognize  that any of\n\n     [them]  has the right  to permit the  inspection in\n\n     his own right and that the others have  assumed the\n\n     risk  that one  of their  number  might permit  the\n\n     common area to be searched.\n\nId.  at  171 n.7.    Even  if  a  party lacks  actual  common\n  \n\nauthority to consent to a search, the search is lawful if the\n\nofficer  conducting the search  reasonably believed, based on\n\nthe  totality of the circumstances, that the consenting party\n\ndid have  common authority.  Illinois v.  Rodriguez, 497 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n177, 185-86 (1990).  In the instant case,  the district court\n\nfound that,  based on  the totality  of these  circumstances,\n\nForey had reason to believe that Anthony had common authority\n\nover  the  residence  in  general and  the  growing  rooms in\n\nparticular.   We find no  clear error in  this finding.   See\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v. Mancini, 8 F.3d 104, 107 (1st Cir. 1993) (in\n                        \n\nreviewing the district court's suppression order, findings of\n\nfact, including mixed findings of fact and law, upheld absent\n\nclear error) (citing cases).\n\n     Forey  could reasonably  have  concluded that  Anthony's\n\nregular use of  the cooking and bath facilities  of the house\n\nauthorized  him to enter and make use  of the common areas of\n\nthe  house in general.   Moreover,  she could  have concluded\n\n                             -4-\n\nreasonably  that, as  a  coconspirator  who  had  an  ongoing\n\ninvolvement  in tending the plants, Anthony was authorized to\n\nenter and to make  use of the second floor area  in which the\n\nmarijuana  was   being  grown.2     These  conclusions   were\n\nconfirmed  by  Anthony's  ready  access  to  the  key to  the\n\nresidence and his knowledge of the combination of the lock on\n\nthe door  behind which  the marijuana was  being grown.   The\n\ntotality of  these circumstances  is sufficient  to establish\n\nthat Chirichiello had forfeited any reasonable expectation of\n\nprivacy in these  areas and, thus, that Anthony  had apparent\n\nauthority to  consent to  the search.   Cf. United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nBuettner-Janusch, 646  F.2d 759,  765-66  (2d Cir.)  (student\n                \n\nassistant who  was authorized  to enter  and use  professor's\n\nlaboratory  had common authority to consent to search), cert.\n                                                            \n\ndenied, 454 U.S.  830 (1981); United States v. Cepulonis, 530\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  238, 244 (1st  Cir.) (participant in  robbery had joint\n\ncontrol  over property  locker  in which  he  and others  had\n\nplaced gun), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 908 (1976); United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Murphy, 506  F.2d 529, 530 (9th Cir.  1974) (employee, who\n         \n\nwas given key to warehouse only when required to perform work\n\non premises, had sufficient control to consent to search).\n\n     Since there is no allegation that any of the information\n\nused in obtaining  the warrant was secured  from observations\n\n                    \n\n2.  There is no contention that the second floor was used for\nany purpose other than the growing of marijuana.\n\n                             -5-\n\nother than those made in the common areas of the house  or on\n\nthe second floor, i.e, no allegation that any information was\n                     \n\nobtained  from the  search of  areas  in which  others had  a\n\nreasonable expectation of privacy, the suppression motion was\n\nproperly  denied.  See Rodriguez, 497  U.S. at 188-89 (search\n                                \n\nvalid if  consenting party  had apparent  authority over  the\n\narea searched).\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                             -6-\n",

Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112475\"><a href=\"/opinion/112475/illinois-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span>, 185-86 (1990).  In the instant case, the district court found that, based on the totality of these circumstances, Forey had reason to believe that Anthony had common authority over the residence in general and the growing rooms in particular.  We find no clear error in this finding.   See United States v. Mancini, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195007\"><a href=\"/opinion/195007/united-states-v-mancini/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 107 (1st Cir. 1993) (in reviewing the district court's suppression order, findings of fact, including mixed findings of fact and law, upheld absent clear error) (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forey could reasonably have concluded that Anthony's regular use of the cooking and bath facilities of the house authorized him to enter and make use of the common areas of the house in general.  Moreover, she could have concluded reasonably that, as a coconspirator who had an ongoing involvement in tending the plants, Anthony was authorized to enter and to make use of the second floor area in which the marijuana was being grown.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  These conclusions were confirmed by Anthony's ready access to the key to the residence and his knowledge of the combination of the lock on the door behind which the marijuana was being grown.  The totality of these circumstances is sufficient to establish that Chirichiello had forfeited any reasonable expectation of privacy in these areas and, thus, that Anthony had apparent authority to consent to the search.

Buettner-Janusch, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"389476\"><a href=\"/opinion/389476/united-states-v-john-buettner-janusch/\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span>, 765-66 (2d Cir.)
