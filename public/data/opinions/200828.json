In the early 1960s, the United\n\nStates acquired for a modest sum an 8.6 acre plot of land in\n\nWellfleet, Massachusetts, as part of the creation of the Cape Cod\n\nNational Seashore.     Remote descendants of a man who owned the\n\nproperty until his death in 1873 now seek to overturn a 1964 state\n\ncourt judgment clearing title in favor of the United States'\n\npredecessor in interest. The federal district court held the state\n\njudgment valid and the descendants now appeal.\n\n          The complex facts are set forth in three different\n\nplaces: the district court's original decision resolving the case\n\nin the government's favor on statute of limitations grounds,\n\nLombard v. United States, 28 F. Supp. 2d 44 (D. Mass. 1998)\n\n(\"Lombard I\"); our own decision remanding the matter for further\n\nproceedings, Lombard v. United States, 194 F.3d 305 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(\"Lombard II\"); and the district court's second decision now under\n\nreview, which again decided in the government's favor based on the\n\n1964 state judgment, Lombard v. United States, No. Civ.A.97-10725-\n\nPBS, 2002 WL 1998245 (D. Mass. Aug. 28, 2002) (\"Lombard III\").\n\n          We therefore content ourselves here with a very short\n\nsummary of facts needed for this new appeal.          When Thomas Lombard\n\ndied in 1873, the property went to his five children.          Two of the\n\nheirs made   a   conveyance   to   George   Higgins   in   1924,   possibly\n\nclaiming that they owned the whole parcel; in any event Higgins\n\nthereafter claimed the whole and sought a Massachusetts Land Court\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fjudgment to that effect in 1935; that case was ultimately dismissed\n\nwithout prejudice.     The   five    children   of   Thomas   Lombard   are\n\ndeceased, but a profusion of remote descendants exist in various\n\nlocations around the country.\n\n          In 1962, the United States bought the property from\n\nHiggins for $13,500 but withheld payment until title was cleared.\n\nIn 1963, Higgins began a quiet title action in the Barnstable\n\nCounty Superior Court, claiming not only title by deed but also by\n\nadverse possession.   At this point none of the Lombard descendants\n\nlived on the land--it was undeveloped save for a family cemetery--\n\nand none were listed in Wellfleet tax records or local land office\n\nrecords as an owner or claimant to the property.\n\n          Although the complaint called for service upon Thomas\n\nLombard and others, including his \"heirs, devisees, or appointees,\"\n\nthe sheriff made a return certifying that he had made a \"diligent\n\nsearch\" for Thomas Lombard and his \"Agent or Attorney\" but found no\n\none (Thomas Lombard being, at this point, long dead).         The sheriff\n\nis no longer alive and no one knows exactly whom he searched for or\n\nin what manner.   What is clear is that the court did not rest its\n\njurisdiction simply upon this faulty return.\n\n          Under Massachusetts law governing quiet title actions,\n\n\"[i]f in such action the court finds that actual service cannot be\n\n. . . made upon a defendant,\" the court may direct notice be given\n\nby posting on the land, or newspaper publication, or both to\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fconstitute \"constructive service on all the defendants.\"                   Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 240, § 7 (2002).           Notice of the suit was given by\n\npublication in a local Cape Cod newspaper in October and November\n\n1963, and by posting notices in the Barnstable County Registry of\n\nDeeds and on the property itself.            Personal service was made on\n\nthree individuals on abutting property.\n\n            In addition, Massachusetts law provides that if despite\n\nsuch notice the court thinks that there may be defendants who have\n\nnot been reached, it may sua sponte or on motion \"appoint a\n\nguardian ad litem or next friend of any such defendant.\"                   Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 240, § 8.      Higgins died while the quiet title suit\n\nwas pending, and Higgins' wife Katherine was substituted for him in\n\nthe suit.    In response to Katherine Higgins' request, the court\n\nappointed    a   guardian   ad    litem,     James     Quirk,      to   represent\n\nunascertained and unknown potential claimants to the property.\n\n            Quirk reported that he had investigated the matter,\n\nincluding the title searcher's report, the title records in the\n\ncounty registry, and the county probate reports, and that he could\n\ndiscover no one else entitled to notice.          The probate records were\n\npertinent because a claim to the land did not appear in the probate\n\ninventories of any of the three Lombard children who did not join\n\nin the 1924 conveyance--and the current plaintiffs' claims rest\n\nentirely on the claims of these ancestors.             It is unclear whether\n\nQuirk   searched   Wellfleet     tax    records   to    see   if    any   of   the\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fdescendants paid taxes on the property, but it appears that he\n\nwould have found nothing, since none of them did.\n\n            The Massachusetts statute provides that if notice is\n\ngiven by posting or publication and the possible appointment of a\n\nguardian ad litem, then \"the court may proceed as though all\n\ndefendants had been actually served with process.\" Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 240, § 10.    It then further provides: \"Such action shall be a\n\nproceeding in rem against the land, and a judgment establishing or\n\ndeclaring the validity, nature or extent of the plaintiff's title\n\nmay be entered, and shall operate directly on the land and have the\n\nforce of a release made by or on behalf of all defendants of all\n\nclaims   inconsistent   with   the    title    established     or   declared\n\nthereby.\"   Id.\n\n            Following Quirk's report, which appended significant\n\nevidence in support of Higgins' adverse possession claim, the court\n\nentered a final decree in August 1964, confirming title in Higgins'\n\nwife save for a reservation of the Lombards' ownership of the\n\nburial plot and an easement to access it.        The court's ruling also\n\nstated that notice was given to all interested parties and that a\n\nguardian ad litem had reported to the court.         The government then\n\npaid Higgins' wife for the property and proceeded to incorporate it\n\ninto the Cape Cod National Seashore.\n\n            Over thirty years later, in April 1997, a number of\n\nThomas   Lombard's   descendants     brought   the   present    action   to\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fpartition the property, claiming as descendants of the three\n\nchildren of Thomas Lombard who had not joined in the 1924 sale.\n\nGiven the number of descendants, each plaintiff's share of the\n\nalleged 60 percent interest in 8.6 acres is small.   But, of course,\n\nthe value of choice Cape Cod property has likely much increased in\n\nthe intervening period.\n\n          These claims might well be defeated by the adverse\n\npossession defense, but the government sought to defend its title\n\nwithout resort to a trial.   It first invoked a twelve-year statute\n\nof limitations on quiet title actions against the United States, 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2409a(g) (2000), and initially prevailed, Lombard I, 28 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 48-50.   When we vacated this judgment, we said that\n\nsummary judgment might still be appropriate based on the 1964 quiet\n\ntitle decree.    Lombard II, 194 F.3d at 312.        On remand, the\n\ndistrict court so found, Lombard III, 2002 WL 1998245, at *8, and\n\nthe descendants now appeal for a second time.\n\n          For the most part, this case is highly idiosyncratic and\n\nthe district court's opinion is lucid and carefully considered. In\n\nsuch a case we might ordinarily affirm summarily on the well-\n\nreasoned decision of the district judge.     But one facet of the\n\nmatter is difficult and may have some precedential value.        We\n\nconfine our discussion to that issue, namely, whether the notice\n\ngiven under the Massachusetts statute was an adequate basis for the\n\n1964 judgment.\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f           The 1964 decree is a formal, final judgment issued by a\n\nstate   court    clearing     title   in     favor    of   the   United    States'\n\npredecessor in interest.        It binds a federal court under the full\n\nfaith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1738 (2000), unless the\n\njudgment itself is void.         The burden of showing that it is void\n\n\"'rests heavily'\" upon those who challenge the judgment.                   Cook v.\n\nCook, 342 U.S. 126, 128 (1951) (quoting Williams v. North Carolina,\n\n325 U.S. 226, 234         (1945)).    The plaintiffs claim that the state\n\ncourt did not give notice of the action to the Lombard descendants\n\nsufficient to meet minimum due process standards.\n\n           Individual service of the papers that initiate a case\n\nnormally constitutes the required \"notice reasonably calculated,\n\nunder all circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the\n\npendency of the action.\"         Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust\n\nCo., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950).          Where the name and address of the\n\nperson who holds an interest in the property is known, \"[n]otice by\n\nmail or other means as certain to ensure actual notice is a minimum\n\nconstitutional precondition.\"          Mennonite Bd. of Missions v. Adams,\n\n462 U.S. 791, 800 (1983).\n\n           But     less    reliable    means     of    notice    suffice     where\n\nreasonable in the circumstances, e.g., where claimants are hard to\n\nascertain or their addresses are unknown.             See Mennonite, 462 U.S.\n\nat 798 n.4.      In Mullane, 339 U.S. at 317, the Supreme Court said:\n\n\"[I]n the case of persons missing or unknown, employment of an\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\findirect and even a probably futile means of notification is all\n\nthat the situation permits and creates no constitutional bar to a\n\nfinal decree foreclosing their rights.\"                   The typical secondary\n\nmeans include notice by publication and posting.                 See, e.g., Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 240, § 7 (2002).                Both methods were employed here,\n\ntogether with a personal search by the sheriff and, thereafter, a\n\nfurther records search by the guardian ad litem.\n\n            The    plaintiffs     assert       that   Higgins--the      person    who\n\ninstigated the 1963-64 quiet title action--knew that there were\n\nsome descendants of Thomas Lombard living in Wellfleet who might\n\nclaim an interest in the property, and Higgins deliberately chose\n\nnot to give them personal notice.              The evidence as to this is murky\n\nand was discounted by the government; but the district court\n\naccepted the possibility.            So we will assume arguendo that the\n\nfactual issue might bar summary judgment--if it were decisive.                     We\n\nconclude that in this case it is not.\n\n            There is a strong public interest in fostering a regime\n\nby which titles can be traced and relied upon.                  Mullane, 339 U.S.\n\nat 313-14.      In this case, the state court that decided the quiet\n\ntitle    action    went    through      an    elaborate      process   designed   to\n\ndetermine that claimants with possible adverse interests were\n\nsought    out     and     given   the        best   notice     available   in     the\n\ncircumstances. As already described, this included not only notice\n\nby posting and publication, but also (apart from the search by the\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fsheriff) the appointment of a guardian ad litem who made his own\n\nrecord search for possible claimants and reported back to the\n\ncourt.    The court accepted the search as sufficient.\n\n               The state court thus did everything that it reasonably\n\ncould     to     establish   its   jurisdiction,   and     the   objective\n\ncircumstances supported the state court's authority to enter a\n\nfinal judgment quieting title to the property.           If there had been\n\nother records giving the names and locations of other possible\n\nclaimants, the sheriff or guardian ad litem would likely have found\n\nthem; but neither did.         In these circumstances, a state court\n\njudgment should not be held \"void\" based on speculations many years\n\nlater as to Higgins' private knowledge at the time.\n\n               Leading cases like Mullane contain general statements\n\nthat notice by posting or publication only suffices where claimants\n\nare otherwise unknown and cannot be personally served.           Mullane,\n\n339 U.S. at 318.      But typically these cases involved statutes that\n\npurported to allow jurisdiction by posting or publication without\n\nregard to whether the claimants could be found; and none of them\n\ninvolved a situation in which a state court, in addition to notice\n\nby posting and publication, appointed a guardian ad litem and\n\nreasonably determined on the basis of objective evidence that\n\nindividual claimants were unknown and could not be personally\n\nserved.        Where a state has adopted and followed a scheme as\n\nprotective as that used in this case, we think the resulting\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fjudgment should not be invalidated by a different court even if a\n\nparty to the original action wrongfully withheld private knowledge\n\nfrom the court.\n\n            Were Higgins alive today and claiming ownership for\n\nhimself, he might well be estopped from relying upon the quiet\n\ntitle judgment if he wrongly procured it.              Cf. InterGen N.V. v.\n\nGrina, 344 F.3d 134, 144 (1st Cir. 2003).              Similarly, the court\n\nthat entered the judgment might, if a timely request had been made,\n\nhave considered a motion to reopen its own judgment based on fraud,\n\nnew evidence or the like.        Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).           Neither\n\npossibility applies here.\n\n            A word should be said about United States v. 125.2 Acres\n\nof Land, 732 F.2d 239 (1st Cir. 1984).          There, the government took\n\na small parcel of Cape Cod land by eminent domain, knowing that one\n\nMatthew Jaeckle had a claim to a part of it and lived in Nantucket.\n\nAlthough he was listed in the telephone book, the government did\n\nnot send him notice but published notice in a local paper and\n\nposted a sign somewhere on the 125 acre tract (apparently not on\n\nJaeckle's portion).      The district court condemned the land in 1947\n\nand later in 1952 valued the land, closing the case but reserving\n\n\"leave to    reinstate    for   cause   shown   upon    application   of   any\n\ninterested party.\"    Id. at 241.\n\n            Thereafter Jaeckle learned of the condemnation and in\n\n1972 sought to reopen, alleging that he had been given insufficient\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fnotice and that the true value at time of condemnation was much\n\nhigher than the amount he was allotted.             This court declined to\n\nupset the condemnation but remanded to permit Jaeckle to contest\n\nthe value as of 1947, pointing out that the government had known of\n\nJaeckle's interest and general location, and could easily have\n\nfound him listed in the telephone book.\n\n            125.2 Acres involved our reopening a federal district\n\ncourt   proceeding   that   had    only    been    half   closed    (given   the\n\nreservation); the reopening was based on objective evidence that\n\nthe government could have easily given personal notice to a known\n\nrecord owner.      Nothing in the opinion indicates that the panel\n\nwould   have    declared    void   the     final    judgment   of    a   sister\n\njurisdiction when it was reasonably entered after the appointment\n\nof a guardian ad litem and a formal determination that all feasible\n\nnotice had been given.      We see no conflict with 125.2 Acres.\n\n            The descendants make a further and wholly different\n\nattack upon the 1964 judgment.        In a nutshell, they say that the\n\nearlier action in the Massachusetts Land Court was not technically\n\ndismissed until the 1970s, and this deprived the Superior Court of\n\nauthority to entertain the quiet title action.               The argument is\n\nhighly technical, rests on peculiar facts, and is not of general\n\ninterest.      On this issue we are content to rely entirely on the\n\ndiscussion by the district court.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f",

In <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U.S. at 317, 70 S.Ct. 652, the Supreme Court said: \"[I]n the case of persons missing or unknown, employment of an indirect and even a probably futile means of notification is all that the situation permits and creates no constitutional bar to a final decree foreclosing their rights.\" The typical secondary means include notice by publication and posting. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 240, &#167; 7 (2002). Both methods were employed here, together with a personal search by the sheriff and, thereafter, a further records search by the guardian <i>ad litem.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs assert that Higgins &#8212; the person who instigated the 1963-64 quiet title action &#8212; knew that there were some descendants of Thomas Lombard living in Wellfleet who might claim an interest in the property, and Higgins deliberately chose not to give them personal notice. The evidence as to this is murky and was discounted by the government; but the district court accepted the possibility. So we will assume <i>arguendo</i> that the factual issue might bar summary judgment &#8212; if it were decisive. We conclude that in this case it is not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a strong public interest in fostering a regime by which titles can be traced and relied upon. <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U.S. at 313-14, 70 S.Ct. 652. In this case, the state court that decided the quiet title action went through an elaborate process designed to determine that claimants with possible adverse interests were sought out and given the best notice available in the circumstances. As already described, this included not only notice by posting and publication, but also (apart from the search by the sheriff) the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> who made his own record search for possible claimants and reported back to the court. The court accepted the search as sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state court thus did everything that it reasonably could to establish its jurisdiction, and the objective circumstances supported the state court's authority to enter a final judgment quieting title to the property. If there had been other records giving the names and locations of other possible claimants, the sheriff or guardian <i>ad litem</i> would likely have found them; but neither did. In these circumstances, a state court judgment should not be held \"void\" based on speculations many years later as to Higgins' private knowledge at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leading cases like <i>Mullane</i> contain general statements that notice by posting or publication only suffices where claimants are otherwise unknown and cannot be personally served. <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U.S. at 318, 70 S.Ct. 652. But typically these cases involved statutes that purported to allow jurisdiction by posting or publication without regard to whether the claimants could be found; and none of them involved a situation in which a state court, in addition to notice by posting and publication, appointed a guardian <i>ad litem</i> and reasonably determined on the basis of objective evidence that individual claimants were unknown and could not be personally served. Where a state has adopted and followed a scheme as protective as that used in this case, we think the resulting judgment should not be invalidated by a different court even if a party to the original action wrongfully withheld private knowledge from the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were Higgins alive today and claiming ownership for himself, he might well be estopped from relying upon the quiet title judgment if he wrongly procured it. <i>Cf. InterGen N.V. v. Grina,</i> 344 F.3d 134, 144 (1st Cir.2003). Similarly, the court that entered the judgment might, if a timely request had been made, have considered a motion to reopen its own judgment based on fraud, new evidence or the like. <i>Cf.</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Neither possibility applies here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A word should be said about <i>United States v. 125.2 Acres of Land,</i> 732 F.2d 239 (1st Cir.1984). There, the government took a small parcel of Cape Cod land by eminent domain, knowing that one Matthew Jaeckle had a claim to a part of it and lived in Nantucket. Although he was listed in the telephone book, the government did not send him notice but published notice in a local paper and posted a sign somewhere on the 125 acre tract (apparently not on Jaeckle's portion). The district court condemned the land in 1947 and later in 1952 valued the land, closing the case but reserving \"leave to reinstate for cause shown upon application of any interested party.\" <i>Id.</i> at 241.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter Jaeckle learned of the condemnation and in 1972 sought to reopen, alleging that he had been given insufficient notice and that the true value at time of condemnation was much higher than the amount he was allotted. This court declined to upset the condemnation but remanded to permit Jaeckle to contest the value as of 1947, pointing out that the government had known of Jaeckle's interest and general location, and could easily have found him listed in the telephone book.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>125.2 Acres</i> involved our reopening a federal district court proceeding that had only been half closed (given the reservation); the reopening was based on objective evidence that the government could have easily given personal notice to a known record owner. Nothing in the opinion indicates that the panel would have declared void the final judgment of a sister jurisdiction when it was reasonably entered after the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> and a formal determination that all feasible notice had been given. We see no conflict with <i>125.2 Acres.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The descendants make a further and wholly different attack upon the 1964 judgment. In a nutshell, they say that the earlier action in the Massachusetts Land Court was not technically dismissed until the 1970s, and this deprived the Superior Court of authority to entertain the quiet title action. The argument is highly technical, rests on peculiar facts, and is not of general interest. On this issue we are content to rely entirely on the discussion by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

When Thomas Lombard died in 1873, the property went to his five children. Two of the heirs made a conveyance to George Higgins in 1924, possibly claiming that they owned the whole parcel; in any event Higgins thereafter claimed the whole and sought a Massachusetts Land Court judgment to that effect in 1935; that case was ultimately dismissed without prejudice.

In <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U.S. at 317, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104786\"><a href=\"/opinion/104786/mullane-v-central-hanover-bank-trust-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span>, the Supreme Court said: \"[I]n the case of persons missing or unknown, employment of an indirect and even a probably futile means of notification is all that the situation permits and creates no constitutional bar to a final decree foreclosing their rights.\" The typical secondary means include notice by publication and posting. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 240, &#167; 7 (2002). Both methods were employed here, together with a personal search by the sheriff and, thereafter, a further records search by the guardian <i>ad litem.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs assert that Higgins &#8212; the person who instigated the 1963-64 quiet title action &#8212; knew that there were some descendants of Thomas Lombard living in Wellfleet who might claim an interest in the property, and Higgins deliberately chose not to give them personal notice. The evidence as to this is murky and was discounted by the government; but the district court accepted the possibility. So we will assume <i>arguendo</i> that the factual issue might bar summary judgment &#8212; if it were decisive. We conclude that in this case it is not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a strong public interest in fostering a regime by which titles can be traced and relied upon. <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U.S. at 313-14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104786\"><a href=\"/opinion/104786/mullane-v-central-hanover-bank-trust-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span>. In this case, the state court that decided the quiet title action went through an elaborate process designed to determine that claimants with possible adverse interests were sought out and given the best notice available in the circumstances. As already described, this included not only notice by posting and publication, but also (apart from the search by the sheriff) the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> who made his own record search for possible claimants and reported back to the court. The court accepted the search as sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state court thus did everything that it reasonably could to establish its jurisdiction, and the objective circumstances supported the state court's authority to enter a final judgment quieting title to the property. If there had been other records giving the names and locations of other possible claimants, the sheriff or guardian <i>ad litem</i> would likely have found them; but neither did. In these circumstances, a state court judgment should not be held \"void\" based on speculations many years later as to Higgins' private knowledge at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leading cases like <i>Mullane</i> contain general statements that notice by posting or publication only suffices where claimants are otherwise unknown and cannot be personally served. <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U.S. at 318, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104786\"><a href=\"/opinion/104786/mullane-v-central-hanover-bank-trust-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span>. But typically these cases involved statutes that purported to allow jurisdiction by posting or publication without regard to whether the claimants could be found; and none of them involved a situation in which a state court, in addition to notice by posting and publication, appointed a guardian <i>ad litem</i> and reasonably determined on the basis of objective evidence that individual claimants were unknown and could not be personally served. Where a state has adopted and followed a scheme as protective as that used in this case, we think the resulting judgment should not be invalidated by a different court even if a party to the original action wrongfully withheld private knowledge from the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were Higgins alive today and claiming ownership for himself, he might well be estopped from relying upon the quiet title judgment if he wrongly procured it. <i>Cf. InterGen N.V. v. Grina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200660\"><a href=\"/opinion/200660/intergen-n-v-v-grina/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 144 (1st Cir.2003). Similarly, the court that entered the judgment might, if a timely request had been made, have considered a motion to reopen its own judgment based on fraud, new evidence or the like. <i>Cf.</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Neither possibility applies here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A word should be said about <i>United States v. 125.2 Acres of Land,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"434666\"><a href=\"/opinion/434666/united-states-v-1252-acres-of-land-more-or-less-situated-in-the-town/\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1984). There, the government took a small parcel of Cape Cod land by eminent domain, knowing that one Matthew Jaeckle had a claim to a part of it and lived in Nantucket. Although he was listed in the telephone book, the government did not send him notice but published notice in a local paper and posted a sign somewhere on the 125 acre tract (apparently not on Jaeckle's portion). The district court condemned the land in 1947 and later in 1952 valued the land, closing the case but reserving \"leave to reinstate for cause shown upon application of any interested party.\" <i>Id.</i> at 241.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter Jaeckle learned of the condemnation and in 1972 sought to reopen, alleging that he had been given insufficient notice and that the true value at time of condemnation was much higher than the amount he was allotted. This court declined to upset the condemnation but remanded to permit Jaeckle to contest the value as of 1947, pointing out that the government had known of Jaeckle's interest and general location, and could easily have found him listed in the telephone book.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>125.2 Acres</i> involved our reopening a federal district court proceeding that had only been half closed (given the reservation); the reopening was based on objective evidence that the government could have easily given personal notice to a known record owner. Nothing in the opinion indicates that the panel would have declared void the final judgment of a sister jurisdiction when it was reasonably entered after the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> and a formal determination that all feasible notice had been given. We see no conflict with <i>125.2 Acres.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The descendants make a further and wholly different attack upon the 1964 judgment. In a nutshell, they say that the earlier action in the Massachusetts Land Court was not technically dismissed until the 1970s, and this deprived the Superior Court of authority to entertain the quiet title action. The argument is highly technical, rests on peculiar facts, and is not of general interest. On this issue we are content to rely entirely on the discussion by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
