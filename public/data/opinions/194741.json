L. 82-414, 66 Stat. 163, as amended (INA),\n                                                     \n\n   241(a)(2)(C),   8  U.S.C.     1251(a)(2)(C).     The  law\n\nnonetheless  permits the Attorney  General to \"adjust[]\" the\n\n\"status\" of  a  \"deportable\"  alien \"to  that  of  an  alien\n\nlawfully admitted  for permanent  residence,\"  but only  if,\n\namong other things, the  alien \"is admissible to the  United\n\nStates for permanent residence . . . .\"  INA    245(a)(2), 8\n\nU.S.C.   1255(a)(2).  And, an alien is not admissible (i.e.,\n                                          \n\nhe is \"excludable\")  if he has been \"convicted of  2 or more\n\noffenses  .  .  .  for  which  the  aggregate  sentences  to\n                                                            \n\nconfinement actually imposed were 5 years  or more . . .  .\"\n                            \n\nINA    212(a)(2)(B),  8  U.S.C.     1182(a)(2)(B)  (emphasis\n\nadded).  \n\n          The  petitioner, convicted of  a firearms offense,\n\nMass. Gen.  L.  ch. 140,     129C,  is deportable.    INA   \n\n241(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C.   1251(a)(2)(C).   He has applied for\n\na  status adjustment.   INA    245(a),  8 U.S.C.    1255(a).\n\nBut, the Attorney General has refused to consider his status\n\nadjustment  application because,  in  her view,  he has  two\n\nconvictions with \"sentences to confinement actually imposed\"\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\ntotalling  more  than   \"5  years.\"     Hence,  he  is   not\n\n\"admissible.\"     See  INA      212(a)(2)(B),  8   U.S.C.   \n                     \n\n1182(a)(2)(B).    For  this  reason  (and  without  deciding\n\nwhether  petitioner  might  be  excludable  for  some  other\n\nreason,  see   generally  INA      212(a)(2),  8   U.S.C.   \n                        \n\n1182(a)(2)), the  Board  of Immigration  Appeals denied  the\n\npetitioner's  request to reopen his deportation proceedings.\n\nPetitioner now asks us to review the Board's decision not to\n\nreopen (embodied in two orders).  See INS v. Doherty, 112 S.\n                                                    \n\nCt.  719,  724-25  (1992)   (orders  denying  reopening  are\n\nreviewable);  Thomas v.  INS, 976  F.2d  786, 789  (1st Cir.\n                            \n\n1992) (per curiam) (same).  Having conducted that review, we\n\nconclude that the rather special legal circumstances present\n\nin  this case  do not  permit  the Board  to  find that  the\n\nsentences \"actually  imposed\" on  petitioner add up  to five\n\nyears.  Hence,  petitioner's case falls outside the scope of\n\nthe \"excludability\" provision on which the Board relied, INA\n\n   212(a)(2)(B), 8  U.S.C.    1182(a)(2)(B).   We  therefore\n\nvacate its decision.\n\n          The  parties  agree  that  the  sentence \"actually\n\nimposed\"  for  unlicensed  possession  of  a  firearm   (the\n\nconviction  that  made appellant  \"deportable\")  amounted to\n\nthirty  days.   They  disagree, however,  about a  different\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nsentence, imposed  after a  1986 state court  conviction for\n\nassault with intent  to rob, Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  265,    20.\n\nOriginally  (on June  12, 1986),  the state  court sentenced\n\npetitioner   \"to  Massachusetts   Correctional  Institution,\n\nConcord for the term of ten (10) years.\"  But, in July 1992,\n\nthe  sentencing judge revoked  his earlier  Concord sentence\n\nand entered  an order resentencing  petitioner, which  order\n\nwas entered on the docket sheet as follows:\n\n          Sentence  imposed on  June  12, 1986  is\n          revoked;   deft.    sentenced   to   the\n          Massachusetts  Correctional Institution,\n          Conco[r]d,  for  the  term of  ten  (10)\n          years  and deemed  to have  been served;\n          the  court  on  imposing  said  sentence\n          ordered that the Deft. be deemed to have\n          served -1709-days of said sentence.\n\nThe parties agree  that we are to treat this  order as if it\n\nwere the  original sentence.  See  Matter of J--, 6  I. &amp; N.\n                                                \n\nDec. 562,  565, 569 (BIA  1955).  They  also agree  that the\n\npetitioner  was released from  confinement at  Concord after\n\n1709 days.  Finally, they agree  that, if one reads the 1992\n                                         \n\nlanguage as  having  \"actually  imposed\"  a  \"sentence[]  to\n\nconfinement\"  of  1709  days, then  petitioner's  \"aggregate\n\nsentences to  confinement actually imposed\" amount  to about\n\nthree months less  than five years.  (1709  days plus the 30\n\nday  firearm  sentence  amounts  to 1739  days;  five  years\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\ncontain  1826  days).   They  disagree,  however, about  the\n\nmeaning of this 1992 sentencing order.\n\n          In the  Government's view, the  sentence \"actually\n\nimposed\"   (retroactively)  in   1992  is   a  sentence   to\n\nconfinement  for \"ten  years,\"  not 1709  days.   The  order\n\nitself  says  that  the  petitioner  is  \"sentenced  to  the\n\nMassachusetts Correctional Institution,  Conco[r]d, for  the\n\nterm  of ten (10) years.\"  Moreover, courts and the Board of\n\nImmigration  Appeals  have  held   that  a  \"sentence[]   to\n\nconfinement  actually  imposed\" means  the  maximum sentence\n\nthat  a court imposes,  even though an  offender might serve\n                                                      \n\nless  than this  maximum sentence  (because time  earned for\n\ngood  behavior, probation, or  other forms  of discretionary\n\nrelief  might lead  to  his earlier  release).   See,  e.g.,\n                                                           \n\nFonseca-Leite v. INS, 961  F.2d 60, 62 (5th Cir.  1992) (two\n                    \n\nconsecutive  three  year  sentences amounted  to  six years,\n\nregardless  of the fact  that only  two years  were actually\n\nserved);  Matter of Castro,  19 I. &amp;  N.

Finally, the Government  reminds us\n\nthat  we  owe  its  interpretation of  the  statutory  words\n\n(\"sentences to confinement actually imposed\") a considerable\n\ndegree  of  respect,   particularly  where,  as  here,   the\n\ninterpretation concerns an  interstitial matter, related  to\n\nthe administration of a complex statutory scheme, in respect\n\nto  which the agency is expert.  See, e.g., Chevron, U.S.A.,\n                                                            \n\nInc. v.  Natural Resources  Defense Council, Inc.,  467 U.S.\n                                                 \n\n837, 843-45 (1984); Mayburg v.  Secretary of Health &amp;  Human\n                                                            \n\nServs., 740 F.2d 100, 105-06 (1st Cir. 1984); Molina v. INS,\n                                                           \n\n981 F.2d 14, 20 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Despite  these  arguments,  we  disagree  with the\n\nGovernment's conclusion.  If the  1986 sentence had not been\n\nrevoked, and  petitioner had merely been  released on parole\n\nin  July 1992,  the  Government's  authorities  might  prove\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\ndeterminative.   But, as the Government  concedes, this case\n\ninstead  hinges purely  on  the interpretation  of the  1992\n\nsentencing order.   That  order, we  concede, speaks  of the\n\n\"sentence\" as if it  were a sentence to confinement  for ten\n\nyears.  But,  it then says that the  defendant is \"deemed to\n\nhave  served -1709- days\" of the sentence, and that the \"ten\n\nyear\"  sentence is \"deemed to  have been served.\"   Once one\n\nadds the undisputed fact (apparently known to the sentencing\n\njudge) that  the petitioner did  serve 1709 days,  the order\n\nsimply imposes that  1709 days as  the term of  confinement.\n\nThat is to say, if  we leave all the \"deem[ing]\"  aside, the\n\norder requires  the defendant to  serve 1709 days  (which he\n\nalready  served), and, at the same time, it leaves the state\n\nwithout  any legal authority to confine him for even one day\n\nmore.  Where there is neither  a logical, nor a legal, nor a\n\npractical   possibility  of   the   order   permitting   any\n\nconfinement beyond 1709 days,  how can one say that  such an\n\norder  \"actually impose[s]\"  a sentence  for ten years?   To\n\nparaphrase  President  Lincoln's  apocryphal   remark  about\n\ncalling  a sheep's tail a  \"leg,\" the order  calls the \"1709\n                                                  \n\ndays\" a  \"term of ten  years,\" but simply  calling it  a ten\n\nyear term  cannot make  it  one.   We  have found  no  case,\n\njudicial or administrative, suggesting the contrary.\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n          For  these  reasons, the  order  of  the Board  is\n\nvacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n\n          So ordered.\n                     \n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n",

Having conducted that review, we\n\nconclude that the rather special legal circumstances present\n\nin  this case  do not  permit  the Board  to  find that  the\n\nsentences \"actually  imposed\" on  petitioner add up  to five\n\nyears.  Hence,  petitioner's case falls outside the scope of\n\nthe \"excludability\" provision on which the Board relied, INA\n\n   212(a)(2)(B), 8  U.S.C.    1182(a)(2)(B).   We  therefore\n\nvacate its decision.\n\n          The  parties  agree  that  the  sentence \"actually\n\nimposed\"  for  unlicensed  possession  of  a  firearm   (the\n\nconviction  that  made appellant  \"deportable\")  amounted to\n\nthirty  days.   They  disagree, however,  about a  different\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nsentence, imposed  after a  1986 state court  conviction for\n\nassault with intent  to rob, Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  265,    20.\n\nOriginally  (on June  12, 1986),  the state  court sentenced\n\npetitioner   \"to  Massachusetts   Correctional  Institution,\n\nConcord for the term of ten (10) years.\"  But, in July 1992,\n\nthe  sentencing judge revoked  his earlier  Concord sentence\n\nand entered  an order resentencing  petitioner, which  order\n\nwas entered on the docket sheet as follows:\n\n          Sentence  imposed on  June  12, 1986  is\n          revoked;   deft.    sentenced   to   the\n          Massachusetts  Correctional Institution,\n          Conco[r]d,  for  the  term of  ten  (10)\n          years  and deemed  to have  been served;\n          the  court  on  imposing  said  sentence\n          ordered that the Deft. be deemed to have\n          served -1709-days of said sentence.\n\nThe parties agree  that we are to treat this  order as if it\n\nwere the  original sentence.  See  Matter of J--, 6  I. &amp; N.\n                                                \n\nDec. 562,  565, 569 (BIA  1955).  They  also agree  that the\n\npetitioner  was released from  confinement at  Concord after\n\n1709 days.  Finally, they agree  that, if one reads the 1992\n                                         \n\nlanguage as  having  \"actually  imposed\"  a  \"sentence[]  to\n\nconfinement\"  of  1709  days, then  petitioner's  \"aggregate\n\nsentences to  confinement actually imposed\" amount  to about\n\nthree months less  than five years.  (1709  days plus the 30\n\nday  firearm  sentence  amounts  to 1739  days;  five  years\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\ncontain  1826  days).   They  disagree,  however, about  the\n\nmeaning of this 1992 sentencing order.\n\n          In the  Government's view, the  sentence \"actually\n\nimposed\"   (retroactively)  in   1992  is   a  sentence   to\n\nconfinement  for \"ten  years,\"  not 1709  days.   The  order\n\nitself  says  that  the  petitioner  is  \"sentenced  to  the\n\nMassachusetts Correctional Institution,  Conco[r]d, for  the\n\nterm  of ten (10) years.\"  Moreover, courts and the Board of\n\nImmigration  Appeals  have  held   that  a  \"sentence[]   to\n\nconfinement  actually  imposed\" means  the  maximum sentence\n\nthat  a court imposes,  even though an  offender might serve\n                                                      \n\nless  than this  maximum sentence  (because time  earned for\n\ngood  behavior, probation, or  other forms  of discretionary\n\nrelief  might lead  to  his earlier  release).   See,  e.g.,\n                                                           \n\nFonseca-Leite v.

If the  1986 sentence had not been\n\nrevoked, and  petitioner had merely been  released on parole\n\nin  July 1992,  the  Government's  authorities  might  prove\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\ndeterminative.   But, as the Government  concedes, this case\n\ninstead  hinges purely  on  the interpretation  of the  1992\n\nsentencing order.   That  order, we  concede, speaks  of the\n\n\"sentence\" as if it  were a sentence to confinement  for ten\n\nyears.  But,  it then says that the  defendant is \"deemed to\n\nhave  served -1709- days\" of the sentence, and that the \"ten\n\nyear\"  sentence is \"deemed to  have been served.\"   Once one\n\nadds the undisputed fact (apparently known to the sentencing\n\njudge) that  the petitioner did  serve 1709 days,  the order\n\nsimply imposes that  1709 days as  the term of  confinement.\n\nThat is to say, if  we leave all the \"deem[ing]\"  aside, the\n\norder requires  the defendant to  serve 1709 days  (which he\n\nalready  served), and, at the same time, it leaves the state\n\nwithout  any legal authority to confine him for even one day\n\nmore.  Where there is neither  a logical, nor a legal, nor a\n\npractical   possibility  of   the   order   permitting   any\n\nconfinement beyond 1709 days,  how can one say that  such an\n\norder  \"actually impose[s]\"  a sentence  for ten years?   To\n\nparaphrase  President  Lincoln's  apocryphal   remark  about\n\ncalling  a sheep's tail a  \"leg,\" the order  calls the \"1709\n                                                  \n\ndays\" a  \"term of ten  years,\" but simply  calling it  a ten\n\nyear term  cannot make  it  one.   We  have found  no  case,\n\njudicial or administrative, suggesting the contrary.\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n          For  these  reasons, the  order  of  the Board  is\n\nvacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n\n          So ordered.\n                     \n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n</pre>",
