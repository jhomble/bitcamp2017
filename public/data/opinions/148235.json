Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n          Torruella, Selya and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jean C. LaRocque, by appointment of the court, for appellant.\n     Vijay Shanker, Attorney, Appellate Section, Criminal Division,\nUnited States Department of Justice, with whom Rosa Emilia\nRodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, Nelson Pérez-Sosa,\nAssistant United States Attorney (Appellate Chief), and Julia M.\nMeconiates, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           June 9, 2010\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.       This appeal raises an issue, new\n\nto this court, that has fomented a circuit split: Is a defendant\n\nwho was sentenced pursuant to a binding C-type plea agreement, Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C), for conspiring to distribute crack cocaine\n\nentitled   to     a   sentence   reduction   by   reason   of   retroactive\n\namendments to the sentencing guidelines designed to lower sentences\n\nfor crack cocaine offenses?        We conclude that, in the absence of\n\nexplicit countervailing language in the plea agreement, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3582(c)(2) does not apply and, therefore, such a defendant is\n\nineligible for the sentence reduction.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           On March 6, 2000, defendant-appellant Robin Eddie Rivera-\n\nMartínez pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to possess with\n\nintent to distribute, inter alia, more than five kilograms of\n\ncocaine base (crack cocaine).        See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.\n\nThe defendant entered his plea after having made an agreement with\n\nthe government pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n\n11(c)(1)(C).1     That rule allows the parties to agree to a specific\n\ndisposition, which will bind the district court if, as, and when\n\n\n\n     1\n       More precisely, the plea agreement was made pursuant to\nformer Rule 11(e)(1)(C), which was revised and renumbered in 2002.\nIt is now Rule 11(c)(1)(C). The revisions are wholly stylistic.\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 advisory committee's note (2002\namendments); see also United States v. Main, 579 F.3d 200, 203 n.2\n(2d Cir. 2009); United States v. Scurlark, 560 F.3d 839, 841 n.3\n(8th Cir. 2009). For ease in exposition, we use the new number\nthroughout.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthe court accepts the agreement.         A plea of this kind is commonly\n\ntermed a \"C-type\" plea, and we will employ that nomenclature.\n\n           The defendant's plea agreement spells out the parties'\n\nagreement that the defendant will receive a 240-month sentence.\n\nAlthough the pact contains no forecast of a guideline sentencing\n\nrange (GSR), paragraph seven includes a stipulation to a total\n\noffense   level    (thirty-seven)      and    a   covenant       against     further\n\nadjustments to that level.\n\n           At     the   change-of-plea       hearing,    the      district    court\n\nprovisionally      accepted   the     proffered     plea     and    ordered     the\n\npreparation of a presentence investigation report (PSI Report).\n\nWhen delivered, the PSI Report suggested a GSR, the calculation of\n\nwhich was premised upon the stipulated total offense level and a\n\ncriminal history category of II.\n\n           The district court convened the disposition hearing on\n\nSeptember 12, 2000.       After rehearsing the PSI Report's guideline\n\ncalculations (which yielded a GSR of 235-293 months), the court\n\nstated that it would \"accept the [C-type] plea agreement stipulated\n\nby the parties and . . . sentence the Defendant accordingly.\"                    It\n\nthen imposed the agreed-upon sentence: 240 months in prison.\n\n           We     fast-forward   to     2007,     when     the     United     States\n\nSentencing Commission announced an across-the-board reduction of\n\nbase offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.                  See USSG App. C,\n\nAmend. 706 (Supp. 2007) (modifying USSG §2D1.1); see also USSG App.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fC, Amend. 711 (Supp. 2007). These amendments, originally effective\n\nNovember 1, 2007, were later made retroactive.          See USSG App. C,\n\nAmend. 713 (Supp. 2008).         Their purpose was to ameliorate the\n\nsentencing disparity between offenses involving powdered cocaine\n\nand   offenses   involving    crack   cocaine.   See   United   States   v.\n\nCaraballo, 552 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n             Seizing upon these developments, the defendant moved for\n\na sentence reduction.        See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).     The district\n\ncourt denied the motion. United States v. Rivera-Martínez, No. 99-\n\n255-003 (D.P.R. Apr. 7, 2009) (unpublished order).              The court\n\nreasoned that because the defendant was \"sentenced under a binding\n\nplea agreement, which contemplated a stipulation on the . . . term\n\nof confinement to be imposed . . . , a further reduction of\n\nimprisonment pursuant to Amendments #706 and 711 . . . is not\n\nconsidered applicable.\"       Id.   This timely appeal ensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n             We normally review a district court's denial of a motion\n\nfor sentence reduction for abuse of discretion.        See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Rodríguez-Peña, 470 F.3d 431, 432 (1st Cir. 2006) (per\n\ncuriam).     Here, however, the threshold question is whether the\n\ndistrict court had authority to revise the sentence.            That is a\n\nquestion of law, which engenders de novo review.           Caraballo, 552\n\nF.3d at 9.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f             For the most part, once a pronounced sentence in a\n\ncriminal case becomes final and unappealable, the sentencing court\n\nmay not revise it.          18 U.S.C. § 3582(c).           Like virtually every\n\ngeneral rule, however, this rule is subject to exceptions. One such\n\nexception provides:\n\n             [I]n the case of a defendant who has been\n             sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on\n             a sentencing range that has subsequently been\n             lowered by the Sentencing Commission . . . the\n             court may reduce the term of imprisonment,\n             after considering the factors set forth in [18\n             U.S.C. §] 3553(a) to the extent that they are\n             applicable, if such a reduction is consistent\n             with applicable policy statements issued by\n             the Sentencing Commission.\n\nId. § 3582(c)(2).      This subsection authorizes a district court to\n\nreduce a sentence if — and only if — the Sentencing Commission\n\nsubsequently amends a guideline on which the sentence was based.\n\nCaraballo, 552 F.3d at 9.\n\n             In this instance, the defendant pleaded guilty by means\n\nof a C-type plea agreement. The applicable rule permits the parties\n\nto   agree   that,   upon    the   entry   of   a   plea    of   guilty    or   nolo\n\ncontendere, the government will \"agree that a specific sentence or\n\nsentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case, or that\n\na particular provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, or policy\n\nstatement, or sentencing factor does or does not apply.\"                    Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(c)(1)(C). Where the parties employ this device (as they\n\ndid in this case), the resultant \"recommendation or request binds\n\nthe court once the court accepts the plea agreement.\"                     Id.   This\n\n                                      -5-\n\fsets up a unique dynamic: although garden-variety plea agreements\n\ngenerally   are   treated   as   binding   on    the   defendant    and    the\n\ngovernment, see United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 28 (1st Cir.\n\n2001), only C-type plea agreements bind the sentencing court as\n\nwell.    See United States v. Scurlark, 560 F.3d 839, 842 (8th Cir.\n\n2009).\n\n            The salient question in this case reduces to whether a\n\ndistrict court has authority, under section 3582(c)(2), to modify\n\na sentence imposed pursuant to a C-type plea agreement when that\n\nagreement was negotiated against the backdrop of guidelines that\n\nwere subsequently amended.       Although this question is one of novel\n\nimpression in this circuit, other courts of appeals have grappled\n\nwith it.     The majority of them have held, albeit with varying\n\nrationales, that the district court lacks such authority under\n\nsection 3582(c)(2).    See, e.g., United States v. Green, 595 F.3d\n\n432, 436 (2d Cir. 2010); United States v. Sanchez, 562 F.3d 275, 279\n\n(3d Cir. 2009); Scurlark, 560 F.3d at 842; United States v. Peveler,\n\n359 F.3d 369, 378-79 (6th Cir. 2004).           Other courts have strayed\n\nfrom this categorical approach in favor of a case-by-case appraisal\n\naimed at determining whether a particular sentence, when rendered,\n\ncould fairly be said to have been based on the guidelines.                See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Garcia, ___ F.3d ___, ___ [2010 WL 1816619,\n\nat *3] (5th Cir. 2010) (per curiam); United States v. Franklin, ___\n\nF.3d ___, ___ [2010 WL 1427536, at *3] (7th Cir. 2010).            One court\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fof appeals, reading the language of section 3582(c)(2) broadly, has\n\nheld that a district court has authority to reduce a sentence\n\nimposed pursuant to a C-type plea agreement.2   See United States v.\n\nCobb, 584 F.3d 979, 985 (10th Cir. 2009).\n\n            We begin our analysis with the elementary proposition\n\nthat a court, within wide limits, should interpret a plea agreement\n\naccording to principles of contract law.     United States v. Ortiz-\n\nSantiago, 211 F.3d 146, 151 (1st Cir. 2000); cf. Teeter, 257 F.3d\n\nat 28    (recognizing certain limits to this analogy).        Once a\n\ndefendant knowingly and voluntarily enters into a plea agreement,\n\nboth the defendant and the government become bound by its terms.\n\nOrtiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d at 151.       If the pact is a C-type plea\n\nagreement and the district court accepts it, the court too is bound\n\nby its terms.   See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C).   While a district\n\ncourt is free to accept or reject a C-type plea agreement, see Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 11(c)(3)(A), it may not, after acceptance, disregard the\n\nterms of such an agreement.   See Green, 595 F.3d at 438; Scurlark,\n\n560 F.3d at 842; Peveler, 359 F.3d at 377.\n\n            The defendant's claim that the guideline amendments bring\n\nhim within the compass of section 3582(c)(2) and entitle him to a\n\n\n     2\n       A panel of the Fourth Circuit held similarly, but the court\ngranted rehearing en banc, simultaneously vacating the panel\nopinion. See United States v. Dews, 551 F.3d 204 (4th Cir. 2008),\nreh'g en banc granted, No. 08-6458 (4th Cir. Feb. 20, 2009). The\nen banc court later dismissed the appeal as moot, and the panel\nopinion is no longer good law. See United States v. Cook, 594 F.3d\n883, 888 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 2010).\n\n                                 -7-\n\fsentence reduction is undermined by the way in which C-type plea\n\nagreements operate.   Once the district court accepts a C-type plea\n\nagreement, the court is obliged to sentence the defendant in strict\n\nconformity with the terms of the agreement.        The sentence is,\n\ntherefore, \"based on\" the plea agreement.     See Green, 595 F.3d at\n\n440-41; Sanchez, 562 F.3d at 282 & n.8; Scurlark, 560 F.3d at 842.\n\nThat is antithetic to the requirements of section 3582(c)(2), under\n\nwhich a district court lacks authority to modify a sentence unless\n\nthat sentence is \"based on a sentencing range that has subsequently\n\nbeen lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\"\n\n           This does not mean that there is no connection between C-\n\ntype plea agreements and the sentencing guidelines.     It is common\n\npractice that, in determining whether to accept or reject the\n\nsentence proposed in a C-type plea agreement, a district court will\n\nuse the guidelines as a point of comparison.      But taking such a\n\nprecautionary step does not transmogrify an agreement-based sentence\n\ninto one based on the guidelines.3 See United States v. Cieslowski,\n\n\n     3\n         To some extent, this conclusion was adumbrated by our\nearlier decision in Caraballo. There, we wrote that \"if an amended\nguideline does not have the effect of lowering the sentencing range\nactually used at sentencing, the defendant's sentence was not based\non that range within the intendment of [section 3582(c)(2)].\" 552\nF.3d at 10; see also United States v. Cardosa, ___ F.3d ___, ___\n[2010 WL 2136664, at *4] (1st Cir. 2010) (holding that \"where the\ndefendant's existing sentence was ultimately determined by the old\ncrack cocaine guidelines . . . resentencing is within the\ndiscretion of the district court\") (emphasis in original). Even\nthough these statements were not made in cases involving C-type\nplea agreements, they are in harmony with our holding today. After\nall, when a defendant enters into a C-type plea agreement, the\n\n                                -8-\n\f410 F.3d 353, 364 (7th Cir. 2005) (\"A sentence imposed under a [C-\n\ntype] plea arises directly from the agreement itself, not from the\n\nGuidelines, even though the court can and should consult the\n\nGuidelines in deciding whether to accept the plea.\").\n\n            The fact that the guidelines may have played a role in\n\nthe parties' negotiation of a particular sentence does not alter\n\nthis analysis.   When a C-type plea is at issue, it is the terms of\n\nthe agreement, not the process of arriving at those terms or the\n\nexternal considerations bearing upon them, that dictate the sentence\n\nto be imposed.   See United States v. Ray, 598 F.3d 407, 409 (7th\n\nCir. 2010); United States v. Bride, 581 F.3d 888, 891 (9th Cir.\n\n2009); see also Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d at 151 (explaining that the\n\ncourt should not look beyond the four corners of a plea agreement\n\nin construing its terms).    Absent an express statement in the plea\n\nagreement   making   the    sentence    dependent   upon   a   guideline\n\ncalculation, a sentence imposed pursuant to a C-type plea agreement\n\nis based on the agreement itself, not on the guidelines. See Green,\n\n595 F.3d at 440-41; Sanchez, 562 F.3d at 282 & n.8; Scurlark, 560\n\nF.3d at 842.\n\n            In the case at hand, the terms of the plea agreement do\n\nnot expressly provide (or even hint) that the stipulated 240-month\n\n\n\ncourt does not sentence the defendant according to a guideline\ncalculation but, rather, according to the sentence stipulated in\nthe plea agreement. Thus, there is no \"sentencing range actually\nused at sentencing.\" Caraballo, 552 F.3d at 10.\n\n                                  -9-\n\fsentence depends on the guidelines.      The fact that the agreement\n\nincludes a stipulation as to the defendant's total offense level\n\ndoes not suffice.     Merely mentioning one integer in a possible\n\nguidelines calculation is not enough to evince a mutual intention\n\nthat the agreed-upon sentence will be adjusted should the relevant\n\nguidelines change.4\n\n          We add a coda.     Even apart from the plain meaning of\n\n\"based on\" in section 3582(c)(2), Rule 11(c)(1)(C) itself precludes\n\na district court from unilaterally altering a sentence lawfully\n\nimposed under a C-type plea agreement.    Once the court accepts such\n\na plea agreement, it is bound by the terms thereof.       See United\n\nStates v. Mukai, 26 F.3d 953, 955 (9th Cir. 1994) (noting that\n\n\"[t]he rules contain no provision for the district court to modify\n\na [C-type] plea agreement\").   Consequently, the court cannot vary\n\nthe agreed-upon sentence unless the terms of the plea agreement\n\nexplicitly authorize it to do so.   See Peveler, 359 F.3d at 378-79.\n\nIn the absence of such a provision, the court is bound to impose\n\n(and leave undisturbed) the agreed-upon sentence.    See Sanchez, 562\n\nF.3d at 281 n.7; id. at 282-83 (Rendell, J., concurring); Peveler,\n\n359 F.3d at 378-79.\n\n\n\n     4\n      Indeed, the instant plea agreement does not even contain the\ningredients from which a GSR could be calculated. It is not only\nsilent as to the defendant's criminal history category but also\nstates explicitly that the parties have not reached a consensus on\nthat subject. Thus, it is impossible, within the four corners of\nthe plea agreement, even to calculate the GSR.\n\n                               -10-\n\f           This result is consistent with the established view that\n\nplea agreements are for the most part governed by principles of\n\ncontract law. In this case, no principle of contract law would have\n\njustified the lower court, once it accepted the agreement, in\n\nrevising the specified sentence.\n\n           In an effort to contradict this conclusion, the defendant\n\nasserts that this is a case that involves a mutual mistake of fact;\n\nthat is, a mutual mistake about a fundamental assumption — the\n\nimmutability of the guidelines that formed the backdrop against\n\nwhich the parties negotiated the agreed-upon sentence. The doctrine\n\nof mutual mistake is recognized in the law of contracts, see 27\n\nSamuel Williston, Williston on Contracts § 70:74 (4th ed. 2003),\n\nbut the attempt to weave it into the fabric of this case is an\n\nexercise in futility.\n\n           Whether a party to a plea agreement may be entitled to\n\nrelief on the ground of mutual mistake is in dispute.              Compare,\n\ne.g., United States v. Olesen, 920 F.2d 538, 542 (8th Cir. 1990)\n\n(holding that principle of mutual mistake does not apply to permit\n\nmodification of plea agreement), with, e.g., United States v.\n\nBradley, 381 F.3d 641, 648 (7th Cir. 2004) (holding that mutual\n\nmistake as to essential element of plea agreement can invalidate\n\nentire   agreement).     This   court    has   indicated   that,   in   rare\n\ninstances, mutual mistake might afford a valid ground for relief\n\nfrom a plea agreement.    See Teeter, 257 F.3d at 28 n.12 (dictum).\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f            We need not resolve this question definitively because\n\nthere is no evidence here of a mutual mistake.       In other words,\n\nthere is nothing that suffices to show an assumption, held by both\n\nthe defendant and the prosecution, that the relevant guidelines\n\nwould not be amended in the future.      The raw materials needed to\n\napply the doctrine of mutual mistake are, therefore, lacking.     See\n\nSanchez, 562 F.3d at 281 n.7; Peveler, 359 F.3d at 378 n.4.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.   The plea agreement at issue here\n\nreflects the parties' agreement to a specific sentence, and the\n\ndistrict court, once it accepted that C-type agreement, was duty\n\nbound to adhere to that sentence.      It follows inexorably that the\n\nimposed sentence is based on the plea agreement itself, not on \"a\n\nsentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\"      18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3582(c)(2).   The upshot is that, notwithstanding the guideline\n\namendments lowering the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses,\n\nsection 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction of the defendant's\n\nsentence.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f",

R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C), for conspiring to distribute crack cocaine entitled to a sentence reduction by reason of retroactive amendments to the sentencing guidelines designed to lower sentences for crack cocaine offenses? We conclude that, in the absence of explicit countervailing language in the plea agreement, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) does not apply and, therefore, such a defendant is ineligible for the sentence reduction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>On March 6, 2000, defendant-appellant Robin Eddie Rivera-Martínez pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute, inter alia, more than five kilograms of cocaine base (crack cocaine). <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846. The defendant entered his plea after having made an agreement with the government pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C).<sup>[1]</sup> That rule allows the parties to agree to a specific disposition, which will bind the district court if, as, and when the court accepts the agreement. A plea of this kind is commonly termed a \"C-type\" plea, and we will employ that nomenclature.</p>\n<p>The defendant's plea agreement spells out the parties' agreement that the defendant will receive a 240-month sentence. Although the pact contains no forecast of a guideline sentencing range (GSR), paragraph seven includes a stipulation to a total offense level (thirty-seven) and a covenant against further adjustments to that level.</p>\n<p>At the change-of-plea hearing, the district court provisionally accepted the proffered plea and ordered the preparation of a presentence investigation report (PSI Report). When delivered, the PSI Report suggested a GSR, the calculation of which was premised upon the stipulated total offense level and a criminal history category of II.</p>\n<p>The district court convened the disposition hearing on September 12, 2000. After rehearsing the PSI Report's guideline calculations (which yielded a GSR of 235-293 months), the court stated that it would \"accept the [C-type] plea agreement stipulated by the parties and . . . sentence the Defendant accordingly.\" It then imposed the agreed-upon sentence: 240 months in prison.</p>\n<p>We fast-forward to 2007, when the United States Sentencing Commission announced an across-the-board reduction of base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses. <i>See</i> USSG App. C, Amend. 706 (Supp.2007) (modifying USSG § 2D1.1); <i>see also</i> USSG App. C, Amend. 711 (Supp.2007). These amendments, originally effective November 1, 2007, were later made retroactive. <i>See</i> USSG App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp.2008). Their purpose was to ameliorate the sentencing disparity between offenses involving powdered cocaine and offenses involving crack cocaine. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Caraballo,</i> 552 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Seizing upon these developments, the defendant moved for a sentence reduction. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). The district court denied the motion. <i>United States v. Rivera-Martínez,</i> No. 99-255-003 (D.P.R. Apr. 7, 2009) (unpublished order). The court reasoned that because the defendant was \"sentenced under a binding plea agreement, which contemplated a stipulation on the . . . term of confinement to be imposed . . ., a further reduction of imprisonment pursuant to Amendments # 706 and 711 . . . is not considered applicable.\" <i>Id.</i> This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We normally review a district court's denial of a motion for sentence reduction for abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Rodríguez-Peña,</i> 470 F.3d 431, 432 (1st Cir.2006) (per curiam). Here, however, the threshold question is whether the district court had authority to revise the sentence. That is a question of law, which engenders de novo review. <i>Caraballo,</i> 552 F.3d at 9.</p>\n<p>For the most part, once a pronounced sentence in a criminal case becomes final and unappealable, the sentencing court may not revise it. 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c). Like virtually every general rule, however, this rule is subject to exceptions. One such exception provides:</p>\n<blockquote>[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission . . . the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. §] 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 3582(c)(2). This subsection authorizes a district court to reduce a sentence ifand only ifthe Sentencing Commission subsequently amends a guideline on which the sentence was based. <i>Caraballo,</i> 552 F.3d at 9.</p>\n<p>In this instance, the defendant pleaded guilty by means of a C-type plea agreement. The applicable rule permits the parties to agree that, upon the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the government will \"agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case, or that a particular provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, or policy statement, or sentencing factor does or does not apply.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C). Where the parties employ this device (as they did in this case), the resultant \"recommendation or request binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement.\" <i>Id.</i> This sets up a unique dynamic: although garden-variety plea agreements generally are treated as binding on the defendant and the government, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14, 28 (1st Cir.2001), only C-type plea agreements bind the sentencing court as well. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Scurlark,</i> 560 F.3d 839, 842 (8th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>The salient question in this case reduces to whether a district court has authority, under section 3582(c)(2), to modify a sentence imposed pursuant to a C-type plea agreement when that agreement was negotiated against the backdrop of guidelines that were subsequently amended. Although this question is one of novel impression in this circuit, other courts of appeals have grappled with it. The majority of them have held, albeit with varying rationales, that the district court lacks such authority under section 3582(c)(2). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Green,</i> 595 F.3d 432, 436 (2d Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Sanchez,</i> 562 F.3d 275, 279 (3d Cir.2009); <i>Scurlark,</i> 560 F.3d at 842; <i>United States v. Peveler,</i> 359 F.3d 369, 378-79 (6th Cir. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> 2004). Other courts have strayed from this categorical approach in favor of a case-by-case appraisal aimed at determining whether a particular sentence, when rendered, could fairly be said to have been based on the guidelines. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Garcia,</i> 606 F.3d 209, 214 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam); <i>United States v. Franklin,</i> 600 F.3d 893, 896 (7th Cir.2010). One court of appeals, reading the language of section 3582(c)(2) broadly, has held that a district court has authority to reduce a sentence imposed pursuant to a C-type plea agreement.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Cobb,</i> 584 F.3d 979, 985 (10th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>We begin our analysis with the elementary proposition that a court, within wide limits, should interpret a plea agreement according to principles of contract law. <i>United States v. Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d 146, 151 (1st Cir.2000); <i>cf. </i><i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 28 (recognizing certain limits to this analogy). Once a defendant knowingly and voluntarily enters into a plea agreement, both the defendant and the government become bound by its terms. <i>Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d at 151. If the pact is a C-type plea agreement and the district court accepts it, the court too is bound by its terms. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C). While a district court is free to accept or reject a C-type plea agreement, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(3)(A), it may not, after acceptance, disregard the terms of such an agreement. <i>See </i><i>Green,</i> 595 F.3d at 438; <i>Scurlark,</i> 560 F.3d at 842; <i>Peveler,</i> 359 F.3d at 377.</p>\n<p>The defendant's claim that the guideline amendments bring him within the compass of section 3582(c)(2) and entitle him to a sentence reduction is undermined by the way in which C-type plea agreements operate. Once the district court accepts a C-type plea agreement, the court is obliged to sentence the defendant in strict conformity with the terms of the agreement. The sentence is, therefore, \"based on\" the plea agreement. <i>See </i><i>Green,</i> 595 F.3d at 440-41; <i>Sanchez,</i> 562 F.3d at 282 n. 8; <i>Scurlark,</i> 560 F.3d at 842. That is antithetic to the requirements of section 3582(c)(2), under which a district court lacks authority to modify a sentence unless that sentence is \"based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\"</p>\n<p>This does not mean that there is no connection between C-type plea agreements and the sentencing guidelines. It is common practice that, in determining whether to accept or reject the sentence proposed in a C-type plea agreement, a district court will use the guidelines as a point of comparison. But taking such a precautionary step does not transmogrify an agreement-based sentence into one based on the guidelines.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> <i>States v. Cieslowski,</i> 410 F.3d 353, 364 (7th Cir.2005) (\"A sentence imposed under a [C-type] plea arises directly from the agreement itself, not from the Guidelines, even though the court can and should consult the Guidelines in deciding whether to accept the plea.\").</p>\n<p>The fact that the guidelines may have played a role in the parties' negotiation of a particular sentence does not alter this analysis. When a C-type plea is at issue, it is the terms of the agreement, not the process of arriving at those terms or the external considerations bearing upon them, that dictate the sentence to be imposed. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ray,</i> 598 F.3d 407, 409 (7th Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Bride,</i> 581 F.3d 888, 891 (9th Cir.2009); <i>see also </i><i>Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d at 151 (explaining that the court should not look beyond the four corners of a plea agreement in construing its terms). Absent an express statement in the plea agreement making the sentence dependent upon a guideline calculation, a sentence imposed pursuant to a C-type plea agreement is based on the agreement itself, not on the guidelines. <i>See </i><i>Green,</i> 595 F.3d at 440-41; <i>Sanchez,</i> 562 F.3d at 282 n. 8; <i>Scurlark,</i> 560 F.3d at 842.</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the terms of the plea agreement do not expressly provide (or even hint) that the stipulated 240-month sentence depends on the guidelines. The fact that the agreement includes a stipulation as to the defendant's total offense level does not suffice. Merely mentioning one integer in a possible guidelines calculation is not enough to evince a mutual intention that the agreed-upon sentence will be adjusted should the relevant guidelines change.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>We add a coda. Even apart from the plain meaning of \"based on\" in section 3582(c)(2), Rule 11(c)(1)(C) itself precludes a district court from unilaterally altering a sentence lawfully imposed under a C-type plea agreement. Once the court accepts such a plea agreement, it is bound by the terms thereof. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mukai,</i> 26 F.3d 953, 955 (9th Cir.1994) (noting that \"[t]he rules contain no provision for the district court to modify a [C-type] plea agreement\"). Consequently, the court cannot vary the agreed-upon sentence unless the terms of the plea agreement explicitly authorize it to do so. <i>See </i><i>Peveler,</i> 359 F.3d at 378-79. In the absence of such a provision, the court is bound to impose (and leave undisturbed) the agreed-upon sentence. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez,</i> 562 F.3d at 281 n. 7; <i>id.</i> at 282-83 (Rendell, J., concurring); <i>Peveler,</i> 359 F.3d at 378-79.</p>\n<p>This result is consistent with the established view that plea agreements are for the most part governed by principles of contract law. In this case, no principle of contract law would have justified the lower court, once it accepted the agreement, in revising the specified sentence.</p>\n<p>In an effort to contradict this conclusion, the defendant asserts that this is a case that involves a mutual mistake of fact; that is, a mutual mistake about a fundamental assumptionthe immutability of the guidelines that formed the backdrop against which the parties negotiated the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*288</span> agreed-upon sentence. The doctrine of mutual mistake is recognized in the law of contracts, <i>see</i> 27 Samuel Williston, Williston on Contracts § 70:74 (4th ed.2003), but the attempt to weave it into the fabric of this case is an exercise in futility.</p>\n<p>Whether a party to a plea agreement may be entitled to relief on the ground of mutual mistake is in dispute. <i>Compare, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Olesen,</i> 920 F.2d 538, 542 (8th Cir.1990) (holding that principle of mutual mistake does not apply to permit modification of plea agreement), <i>with, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Bradley,</i> 381 F.3d 641, 648 (7th Cir.2004) (holding that mutual mistake as to essential element of plea agreement can invalidate entire agreement). This court has indicated that, in rare instances, mutual mistake might afford a valid ground for relief from a plea agreement. <i>See </i><i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 28 n. 12 (dictum).</p>\n<p>We need not resolve this question definitively because there is no evidence here of a mutual mistake. In other words, there is nothing that suffices to show an assumption, held by both the defendant and the prosecution, that the relevant guidelines would not be amended in the future. The raw materials needed to apply the doctrine of mutual mistake are, therefore, lacking. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez,</i> 562 F.3d at 281 n. 7; <i>Peveler,</i> 359 F.3d at 378 n. 4.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. The plea agreement at issue here reflects the parties' agreement to a specific sentence, and the district court, once it accepted that C-type agreement, was duty bound to adhere to that sentence. It follows inexorably that the imposed sentence is based on the plea agreement itself, not on \"a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). The upshot is that, notwithstanding the guideline amendments lowering the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, section 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction of the defendant's sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  More precisely, the plea agreement was made pursuant to former Rule 11(e)(1)(C), which was revised and renumbered in 2002. It is now Rule 11(c)(1)(C). The revisions are wholly stylistic. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 advisory committee's note (2002 amendments); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Main,</i> 579 F.3d 200, 203 n. 2 (2d Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Scurlark,</i> 560 F.3d 839, 841 n. 3 (8th Cir.2009). For ease in exposition, we use the new number throughout.</p>\n<p>[2]  A panel of the Fourth Circuit held similarly, but the court granted rehearing en banc, simultaneously vacating the panel opinion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Dews,</i> 551 F.3d 204 (4th Cir. 2008), <i>reh'g en banc granted,</i> No. 08-6458 (4th Cir. Feb. 20, 2009). The en banc court later dismissed the appeal as moot, and the panel opinion is no longer good law. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cook,</i> 594 F.3d 883, 888 n. 3 (D.C.Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>[3]  To some extent, this conclusion was adumbrated by our earlier decision in <i>Caraballo.</i> There, we wrote that \"if an amended guideline does not have the effect of lowering the sentencing range actually used at sentencing, the defendant's sentence was not based on that range within the intendment of [section 3582(c)(2)].\" 552 F.3d at 10; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Cardosa,</i> 606 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2010) (holding that \"where the defendant's existing sentence was ultimately <i>determined</i> by the old crack cocaine guidelines . . . resentencing is within the discretion of the district court\") (emphasis in original). Even though these statements were not made in cases involving C-type plea agreements, they are in harmony with our holding today. After all, when a defendant enters into a C-type plea agreement, the court does not sentence the defendant according to a guideline calculation but, rather, according to the sentence stipulated in the plea agreement. Thus, there is no \"sentencing range actually used at sentencing.\" <i>Caraballo,</i> 552 F.3d at 10.</p>\n<p>[4]  Indeed, the instant plea agreement does not even contain the ingredients from which a GSR could be calculated. It is not only silent as to the defendant's criminal history category but also states explicitly that the parties have not reached a consensus on that subject. Thus, it is impossible, within the four corners of the plea agreement, even to calculate the GSR.</p>\n\n</div>",

Other courts have strayed from this categorical approach in favor of a case-by-case appraisal aimed at determining whether a particular sentence, when rendered, could fairly be said to have been based on the guidelines. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Garcia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"146061\"><a href=\"/opinion/146061/united-states-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span>, 214 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam); <i>United States v. Franklin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1461440\"><a href=\"/opinion/1461440/united-states-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span>, 896 (7th Cir.2010). One court of appeals, reading the language of section 3582(c)(2) broadly, has held that a district court has authority to reduce a sentence imposed pursuant to a C-type plea agreement.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Cobb,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1436388\"><a href=\"/opinion/1436388/united-states-v-cobb/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></a></span>, 985 (10th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>We begin our analysis with the elementary proposition that a court, within wide limits, should interpret a plea agreement according to principles of contract law. <i>United States v. Ortiz-Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198902\"><a href=\"/opinion/198902/united-states-v-ortiz-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span>, 151 (1st Cir.2000); <i>cf. </i><i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 28 (recognizing certain limits to this analogy). Once a defendant knowingly and voluntarily enters into a plea agreement, both the defendant and the government become bound by its terms. <i>Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d at 151. If the pact is a C-type plea agreement and the district court accepts it, the court too is bound by its terms. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C). While a district court is free to accept or reject a C-type plea agreement, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(3)(A), it may not, after acceptance, disregard the terms of such an agreement. <i>See </i><i>Green,</i> 595 F.3d at 438; <i>Scurlark,</i> 560 F.3d at 842; <i>Peveler,</i> 359 F.3d at 377.</p>\n<p>The defendant's claim that the guideline amendments bring him within the compass of section 3582(c)(2) and entitle him to a sentence reduction is undermined by the way in which C-type plea agreements operate. Once the district court accepts a C-type plea agreement, the court is obliged to sentence the defendant in strict conformity with the terms of the agreement. The sentence is, therefore, \"based on\" the plea agreement. <i>See </i><i>Green,</i> 595 F.3d at 440-41; <i>Sanchez,</i> 562 F.3d at 282 n. 8; <i>Scurlark,</i> 560 F.3d at 842. That is antithetic to the requirements of section 3582(c)(2), under which a district court lacks authority to modify a sentence unless that sentence is \"based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\"</p>\n<p>This does not mean that there is no connection between C-type plea agreements and the sentencing guidelines. It is common practice that, in determining whether to accept or reject the sentence proposed in a C-type plea agreement, a district court will use the guidelines as a point of comparison. But taking such a precautionary step does not transmogrify an agreement-based sentence into one based on the guidelines.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> <i>States v. Cieslowski,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790494\"><a href=\"/opinion/790494/united-states-v-paul-cieslowski/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span>, 364 (7th Cir.2005) (\"A sentence imposed under a [C-type] plea arises directly from the agreement itself, not from the Guidelines, even though the court can and should consult the Guidelines in deciding whether to accept the plea.\").</p>\n<p>The fact that the guidelines may have played a role in the parties' negotiation of a particular sentence does not alter this analysis. When a C-type plea is at issue, it is the terms of the agreement, not the process of arriving at those terms or the external considerations bearing upon them, that dictate the sentence to be imposed. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ray,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"294\"><a href=\"/opinion/294/united-states-v-ray/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span>, 409 (7th Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Bride,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1266461\"><a href=\"/opinion/1266461/united-states-v-bride/\"><span class=\"volume\">581</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span>, 891 (9th Cir.2009); <i>see also </i><i>Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d at 151 (explaining that the court should not look beyond the four corners of a plea agreement in construing its terms). Absent an express statement in the plea agreement making the sentence dependent upon a guideline calculation, a sentence imposed pursuant to a C-type plea agreement is based on the agreement itself, not on the guidelines. <i>See </i><i>Green,</i> 595 F.3d at 440-41; <i>Sanchez,</i> 562 F.3d at 282 n. 8; <i>Scurlark,</i> 560 F.3d at 842.</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the terms of the plea agreement do not expressly provide (or even hint) that the stipulated 240-month sentence depends on the guidelines. The fact that the agreement includes a stipulation as to the defendant's total offense level does not suffice. Merely mentioning one integer in a possible guidelines calculation is not enough to evince a mutual intention that the agreed-upon sentence will be adjusted should the relevant guidelines change.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>We add a coda. Even apart from the plain meaning of \"based on\" in section 3582(c)(2), Rule 11(c)(1)(C) itself precludes a district court from unilaterally altering a sentence lawfully imposed under a C-type plea agreement. Once the court accepts such a plea agreement, it is bound by the terms thereof. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mukai,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672122\"><a href=\"/opinion/672122/united-states-v-karil-mukai/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span>, 955 (9th Cir.1994) (noting that \"[t]he rules contain no provision for the district court to modify a [C-type] plea agreement\"). Consequently, the court cannot vary the agreed-upon sentence unless the terms of the plea agreement explicitly authorize it to do so. <i>See </i><i>Peveler,</i> 359 F.3d at 378-79. In the absence of such a provision, the court is bound to impose (and leave undisturbed) the agreed-upon sentence. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez,</i> 562 F.3d at 281 n. 7; <i>id.</i> at 282-83 (Rendell, J., concurring); <i>Peveler,</i> 359 F.3d at 378-79.</p>\n<p>This result is consistent with the established view that plea agreements are for the most part governed by principles of contract law. In this case, no principle of contract law would have justified the lower court, once it accepted the agreement, in revising the specified sentence.</p>\n<p>In an effort to contradict this conclusion, the defendant asserts that this is a case that involves a mutual mistake of fact; that is, a mutual mistake about a fundamental assumptionthe immutability of the guidelines that formed the backdrop against which the parties negotiated the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*288</span> agreed-upon sentence. The doctrine of mutual mistake is recognized in the law of contracts, <i>see</i> 27 Samuel Williston, Williston on Contracts § 70:74 (4th ed.2003), but the attempt to weave it into the fabric of this case is an exercise in futility.</p>\n<p>Whether a party to a plea agreement may be entitled to relief on the ground of mutual mistake is in dispute. <i>Compare, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Olesen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552412\"><a href=\"/opinion/552412/united-states-v-michael-joe-olesen-united-states-of-america-v-michael/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 542 (8th Cir.1990) (holding that principle of mutual mistake does not apply to permit modification of plea agreement), <i>with, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Bradley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787536\"><a href=\"/opinion/787536/united-states-v-jonathan-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 648 (7th Cir.2004) (holding that mutual mistake as to essential element of plea agreement can invalidate entire agreement). This court has indicated that, in rare instances, mutual mistake might afford a valid ground for relief from a plea agreement. <i>See </i><i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 28 n. 12 (dictum).</p>\n<p>We need not resolve this question definitively because there is no evidence here of a mutual mistake. In other words, there is nothing that suffices to show an assumption, held by both the defendant and the prosecution, that the relevant guidelines would not be amended in the future. The raw materials needed to apply the doctrine of mutual mistake are, therefore, lacking. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez,</i> 562 F.3d at 281 n. 7; <i>Peveler,</i> 359 F.3d at 378 n. 4.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. The plea agreement at issue here reflects the parties' agreement to a specific sentence, and the district court, once it accepted that C-type agreement, was duty bound to adhere to that sentence. It follows inexorably that the imposed sentence is based on the plea agreement itself, not on \"a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). The upshot is that, notwithstanding the guideline amendments lowering the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, section 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction of the defendant's sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  More precisely, the plea agreement was made pursuant to former Rule 11(e)(1)(C), which was revised and renumbered in 2002. It is now Rule 11(c)(1)(C). The revisions are wholly stylistic. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 advisory committee's note (2002 amendments); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Main,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1358521\"><a href=\"/opinion/1358521/united-states-v-main/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 203 n. 2 (2d Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Scurlark,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1227150\"><a href=\"/opinion/1227150/united-states-v-scurlark/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span>, 841 n. 3 (8th Cir.2009). For ease in exposition, we use the new number throughout.</p>\n<p>[2]  A panel of the Fourth Circuit held similarly, but the court granted rehearing en banc, simultaneously vacating the panel opinion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Dews,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></span> (4th Cir. 2008), <i>reh'g en banc granted,</i> No. 08-6458 (4th Cir. Feb. 20, 2009). The en banc court later dismissed the appeal as moot, and the panel opinion is no longer good law. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cook,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187526\"><a href=\"/opinion/187526/united-states-v-cook/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">883</span></a></span>, 888 n. 3 (D.C.Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>[3]  To some extent, this conclusion was adumbrated by our earlier decision in <i>Caraballo.</i> There, we wrote that \"if an amended guideline does not have the effect of lowering the sentencing range actually used at sentencing, the defendant's sentence was not based on that range within the intendment of [section 3582(c)(2)].\" 552 F.3d at 10; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Cardosa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"147475\"><a href=\"/opinion/147475/united-states-v-cardosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir. 2010) (holding that \"where the defendant's existing sentence was ultimately <i>determined</i> by the old crack cocaine guidelines . . . resentencing is within the discretion of the district court\") (emphasis in original). Even though these statements were not made in cases involving C-type plea agreements, they are in harmony with our holding today. After all, when a defendant enters into a C-type plea agreement, the court does not sentence the defendant according to a guideline calculation but, rather, according to the sentence stipulated in the plea agreement. Thus, there is no \"sentencing range actually used at sentencing.\" <i>Caraballo,</i> 552 F.3d at 10.</p>\n<p>[4]  Indeed, the instant plea agreement does not even contain the ingredients from which a GSR could be calculated. It is not only silent as to the defendant's criminal history category but also states explicitly that the parties have not reached a consensus on that subject. Thus, it is impossible, within the four corners of the plea agreement, even to calculate the GSR.</p>\n\n</div>",
