The district  court, after  an\n\nevidentiary  hearing, held  that  the notice  was timely  and\n\ntherefore  granted  judgment   for  plaintiff-appellee   Brox\n\nIndustries in the amount of $178,155.86.   We affirm.  \n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          We set forth a summary of the pertinent facts found\n\nby the district court.  In June 1991 defendant-appellant H.J.\n\nStabile &amp;  Son, Inc.  entered into a  contract with  Wal-Mart\n\nStores, Inc. to build a store in Seabrook, New Hampshire.  In\n\nJuly 1991 Stabile obtained  a payment bond from co-defendant-\n\nappellant Reliance  Insurance Company.  Reliance,  of course,\n\nis  the  real  party   in  interest.    Stabile  subsequently\n\nsubcontracted  with Atom Contracting Corp.  to do work on the\n\nWal-Mart  project.  Atom  then subcontracted with  Brox to do\n\nboth on-site and off-site paving.\n\n          Under Stabile's contract with Wal-Mart all work was\n\nto be  completed on the project by December 3, 1991.  By mid-\n\nDecember Brox had not completed  a substantial portion of the\n\npaving work under  its contract  with Atom.   On December  13\n\nStabile instructed  Brox that  it should cease  operations on\n\nthe project due  to the onset of winter.   Because all of the\n\nparties recognized that paving cannot be done properly in the\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nwinter,  they agreed  that  Brox would  return the  following\n\nspring to  complete the  work.  Stabile  fully expected  that\n\nBrox  would return to the  work-site in the  spring, and Brox\n\nanticipated  doing so.   On December  23, 1991  Brox notified\n\nStabile  that  substantial  work  remained  for  the  spring,\n\nprovided Stabile with an estimate of the remaining  work, and\n\nstated  that the total amount of the paving work performed to\n\ndate  was $201,106.50.  Brox  invoiced Atom for  this work in\n\nDecember 1991.\n\n          In February and March 1992, in response to concerns\n\nof  Wal-Mart  about  the   quality  of  Brox's  paving,  Brox\n\nconducted tests  of its work.   Also  in March  1992, a  Brox\n\nemployee  filled  in  several  potholes at  the  worksite  in\n\npreparation for returning to the project.\n\n          By March of 1992 Stabile had paid Atom all sums due\n\nfor work performed by  Atom and its subcontractors, including\n\nBrox.   Atom, however,  still owed Brox  $178,155.86 for work\n\ndone through December 13, 1991.  On March 18, 1992 Brox  sent\n\na  notice of claim for that amount  to Reliance as surety for\n\nStabile.  Nonetheless, Brox  anticipated that it would finish\n\nthe paving work in the spring under its contract with Atom.\n\n          On  May  14, 1992  Atom  informed  Stabile that  it\n\nintended to honor their  contract, and that the State  of New\n\nHampshire  wanted two  roads,  which were  contiguous to  the\n\nplanned  store, to  be paved by  June 1.   On  June 4 Stabile\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nagreed to the additional  paving with a charge back  to Atom.\n\nAlthough  the  specifics  are  unclear,   shortly  thereafter\n\nStabile  recognized that  Atom would  be unable  to meet  its\n\ncontractual obligations, and therefore  it sought to engage a\n\nnew contractor to complete the paving work.\n\n          On June  11, after a brief  bidding period, Stabile\n\nand Brox entered into two contracts for the completion of the\n\npaving at the project,  one for on-site and one  for off-site\n\nwork.   On June 30  Stabile formally terminated  its contract\n\nwith Atom.  Brox finished the paving work at the project.\n\n          In August 1992 Brox commenced a diversity action in\n\nthe  United States  District Court  for the  District of  New\n\nHampshire against Stabile and  Reliance seeking payment under\n\nthe bond issued by Reliance as surety for Stabile.  Under the\n\nbond,  a party not in direct privity with the principal, such\n\nas Brox, must  give notice of its  claim to:   the Principal,\n\nthe Surety, or the Owner, \"within ninety (90) days after such\n\nclaimant did or  performed the last of the  work or labor, or\n\nfurnished the last of  the materials for which said  claim is\n\nmade.\"  No claim is  made that Brox failed to give  notice as\n\nrequired to the Principal, Surety or Owner.\n\n          The principal defense  of Stabile  and Reliance  is\n\nthat  Brox's March  18, 1992  notice was  untimely under  the\n\nbond's requirements.   Brox moved for  summary judgment based\n\non two alternative  theories.  It argued first that, assuming\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\narguendo  that its  notice was  untimely, Reliance  must show\n        \n\nprejudice from the  tardiness in order to bar  recovery under\n\nthe  bond.  According to  Brox, no prejudice  could be shown.\n\nAlternatively, Brox  maintained that  its  notice was  timely\n\nunder the bond.\n\n          The district court, in  an opinion dated August 18,\n\n1993,  found that Brox's notice was timely.  According to the\n\ndistrict court, \"[t]he crux of  the case . . . appears  to be\n\nwhether [Brox's]  work  [was] completed  in December,  1991.\"\n\nBrox  Industries, Inc. v. H.J.  Stabile &amp; Son,  Inc., No. 92-\n                                                    \n\n426-L,  slip op.  at  6 (D.N.H.  August 18,  1993).   At  the\n\nevidentiary  hearing the  court stated  that \"[i]f  . .  . an\n\nagreement  [about  a winter  hiatus]  was  made then  clearly\n\n[Brox's]  work  under  its  subcontract  with  Atom  was  not\n\ncompleted  on December 13, 1991 and  [Brox's] failure to give\n\nnotice  within ninety days of that day would not bar recovery\n\nunder  the bond.\"   Because the  court eventually  found that\n\nBrox still had  substantial work to do on  the contract as of\n\nDecember 13, and that  the parties agreed to a  winter hiatus\n\nof greater than ninety  days, it held that Brox's  notice was\n\nnot untimely.  Id. at 7.\n                  \n\n          In response  to Brox's  argument that work  done at\n\nthe project  site in February  and March 1992,  i.e., quality\n                                                    \n\ntests  and  pothole  repairs,  reset  the  ninety-day  notice\n\nperiod,  the district court found that both the tests and the\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\npothole repairs were remedial in nature  and did not \"advance\n\nthe  completion of  the project.\"   Id.  at 5.   Accordingly,\n                                       \n\nunder New  Hampshire law, the  district court found  that the\n\nabove work  had no effect upon the  ninety-day notice period.\n\nSee Tolles-Bickford Co.  v. School, 94 A.2d  374 (N.H. 1953).\n                                  \n\nThis conclusion  and its predicate factual  findings have not\n\nbeen appealed.  The  court entered judgment for Brox  for the\n\nfull amount of its claim, and defendants appealed.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          The focus of this litigation has been twofold:  (1)\n\nwhether, given the circumstances  surrounding Brox's work  on\n\nthe  project, its notice of  March 18, 1992  was timely under\n\nthe bond issued by  Reliance; and (2) whether, if  the notice\n\nwas not timely, Reliance  must demonstrate prejudice from the\n\ndelay  in order to bar Brox's recovery.  Because the district\n\ncourt ruled in the  affirmative on the first issue,  it never\n\nreached the second.\n\n          Because this is a diversity action, the substantive\n\nlaw  of the forum  attaches.  Erie R.R.  Co. v. Tompkins, 304\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  64,  78  (1938).   The  parties'  arguments  as to  the\n\ntimeliness  of Brox's  notice  hinge upon  two New  Hampshire\n\nSupreme Court cases.\n\n          In  American Fidelity  Co.  v. Cray,  194 A.2d  763\n                                             \n\n(N.H. 1963) a claimant  on a payment bond was  precluded from\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nrecovering due to  late notice  of claim.   The principal  in\n\nCray  was under a contract  with the State  of New Hampshire.\n    \n\nIt was required by statute to obtain a contract bond, and the\n\nbond's notice  requirement was prescribed by  statute.  Under\n\nthe version  of N.H.  RSA 447:17 in  effect at that  time, in\n\norder to obtain the benefit of the bond, a claimant for labor\n\nperformed or  materials furnished  \"shall within  ninety days\n\nafter said claimant ceases to  perform said labor or  furnish\n\nsaid materials . . . file . . . with the department of public\n\nworks and highways . . . a statement of the claim.\"  From May\n\nto  November 1958, Cray  provided fuel and  lubricants to the\n\nprincipal on a  highway construction project.   In late 1958,\n\nprior to the  completion of the  project, the principal  shut\n\ndown the  job for the  winter.   It never returned.   In  the\n\nspring  of  1959 the  surety  completed  the project  through\n\nanother construction  company.   In May  1959 Cray noticed  a\n\nclaim with the proper  authority for money owed to it  by the\n\nprincipal.\n\n          Although Cray did not  provide any materials to the\n\nprincipal  after November 1958 -- more than ninety days prior\n\nto  its filing a claim under the bond -- Cray maintained that\n\nit did not \"cease\"  to furnish fuel and lubricants  under the\n\nbond at the  time of  the winter shutdown  in November  1958.\n\nCray  argued that  its  agreement with  the  principal was  a\n\ncontinuing one  such that  the ninety day  notice requirement\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nshould have been  tolled during the  seasonal hiatus.   After\n\nreviewing  the facts of  the case, the  New Hampshire Supreme\n\nCourt stated:\n\n          We cannot accept  Cray's contention  that\n          it  ceased to  furnish  materials not  in\n          November  1958,  after   which  date   no\n          materials were in fact furnished, but the\n          following spring when  LaClair failed  to\n          resume operations.\n\nId. at  766.   Defendants  argue that  Brox  is in  the  same\n   \n\nposition  as Cray  was,  and  that  its notice  is  therefore\n\nuntimely.\n\n          Defendants' position is  substantially undercut  by\n\nthe New  Hampshire Supreme Court's subsequent  opinion in New\n                                                             \n\nEngland Metal Culvert Co.  v. A.E. Williams Construction Co.,\n                                                            \n\n196  A.2d 713 (N.H. 1963).  In  New England Metal Culvert the\n                                                         \n\ncontractor on a highway  construction project placed a single\n\norder  with  the  plaintiff   in  January  1961  for  various\n\nmaterials,  including a metal culvert  and pipe.   As was the\n\ncase in  Cray, the  contractor  was under  contract with  the\n             \n\nState,  and  was  required  by statute  to  obtain  a  bond.1\n\nDelivery of  the pipe was to  be \"as required.\"   Id. at 714.\n                                                     \n\nOn April  25, 26 and 27, 1961  a metal culvert was delivered,\n\nbut the contractor  was not ready to receive the pipe, and it\n\nwas  not delivered.  In October 1961, after learning that the\n\n                    \n\n1.  On April 29, 1961 the notice requirement contained in RSA\n447:17, see supra p. 7, was amended to require such  a filing\n                 \n\"within ninety  days after  the completion and  acceptance of\nthe project.\"\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\ncontractor was  in financial  straits, the plaintiff  filed a\n\nnotice of claim under  the bond for payment of  the materials\n\nthat it had delivered in  April.  The contractor subsequently\n\ndefaulted  on   the  project,   and   the  surety   completed\n\nconstruction through  a different  construction company.   In\n\nDecember 1961  a new construction  company was  hired by  the\n\nsurety to finish the job.  This new company ordered the exact\n\nsame  pipe from the plaintiff  that had been  ordered by, but\n\nnever delivered to, the  original contractor.  Id.   The pipe\n                                                  \n\nwas delivered by plaintiff to the  new contractor on December\n\n13 and 15, 1961 and was paid for in a timely manner.\n\n          The court ruled that  plaintiff's October 27,  1961\n\nnotice  was timely  under  the pre-amendment  version of  the\n\nnotice statute.   Id. at 715.   This conclusion was  based on\n                     \n\ntwo  factors.  First, the contract  between plaintiff and the\n\noriginal contractor \"was a single contract although separable\n\nor  divisible  as to  deliveries.\"   Id.   And  second, \"[o]n\n                                        \n\nOctober, 27,  1961, when the  plaintiff first gave  notice of\n\nits claim, although more  than ninety days had  elapsed since\n\ndelivery of the  culvert it  had not then  ceased to  furnish\n\nmaterials, but was  bound by its [original]  contract to make\n\nadditional deliveries on request.\"  Id.  Moreover,\n                                       \n\n          the  remaining pipe was  furnished to the\n          job on  December 13 and 15,  1961 for use\n          in  carrying out  the  contract with  the\n          State.  Thus the  plaintiff did not cease\n          to furnish materials  within the  meaning\n          of RSA 447:17 until December 15, 1961 . .\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          .  .   Unlike  the situation  in American\n                                                   \n          Fidelity   Co.   v.   Cray,  supra,   the\n                                            \n          plaintiff  in  this  case  had  a  single\n          contract  for a  series of  deliveries of\n          specified materials.\n\nId.    (citation omitted).    The court  concluded  that \"[a]\n   \n\nnotice  filed within  ninety  days of  the  last delivery  on\n\nDecember 15, 1961 would  have constituted compliance with the\n\nrequirements of  the statute before amendment,  and permitted\n\nrecourse to the bond for recovery of the price of the culvert\n\ndelivered in April 1961.\"   Id.  The court further held  that\n                               \n\nalthough  plaintiff's filing  was  premature,  the  premature\n\nnotice satisfied the notice requirement.  Id. at 716.\n                                             \n\n          Brox argues  that it  is similarly situated  to the\n\nplaintiff in  New England Metal Culvert, and  that its notice\n                                       \n\nwas therefore  timely.  We  agree.   As in New  England Metal\n                                                             \n\nCulvert, Brox  had a single contract with  Atom.  At the time\n       \n\nBrox  gave notice  of its  claim, more  than ninety  days had\n\npassed   since  its   last  paving   work  on   the  project.\n\nNevertheless,  at the time Brox gave its notice, it was still\n\nobligated to complete the paving work  after the spring thaw.\n\nBrox  eventually  completed  the paving  work  necessary  for\n\ncarrying  out  Stabile's  contract   with  Wal-Mart.    These\n\nfactors,  we  believe, place  this  case  squarely under  the\n\nshadow cast by New England Metal Culvert.2\n                                        \n\n                    \n\n2.  The  district  court  also  found,  consistent  with  New\n                                                             \nEngland  Metal Culvert,  that Brox's  notice was,  in effect,\n                      \nprematurely  filed.  Brox Industries,  Inc. v. H.J. Stabile &amp;\n                                                             \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          Accordingly, under the rule articulated  by the New\n\nHampshire  Supreme Court in  New England Metal  Culvert, if a\n                                                       \n\nclaimant is still obligated  to perform additional work under\n\nits original contract  at the  time notice is  given under  a\n\npayment bond, such  as the one at  issue here, the  notice is\n\nnot  untimely even if more than ninety days have passed since\n\nthe  last  work was  performed  by  the  claimant  under  the\n\noriginal contract.  In effect,  the claimant's notice can  be\n\nviewed as  covering the claimant's  prior work, for  which it\n\nhas  not been paid, as well as  the work that it is obligated\n\nto perform  in the future --  work for which it  has also not\n\nyet been paid.   The ninety-day notice period does  not begin\n\nto run until the claimant actually completes the work that it\n\nwas contractually obligated to perform at the time notice was\n\ngiven.  Thus, as  the New Hampshire Supreme Court  has noted,\n\nalthough the claimant's notice is premature, it is valid.\n\n          At oral argument Reliance sought to distinguish New\n                                                             \n\nEngland  Metal Culvert on the ground that one contract was at\n                      \n\nissue in that  case whereas two  contracts are implicated  in\n\nthe present case.   Defendants' contention is not persuasive.\n\nIt  is clear, as in  the present case,  that the plaintiff in\n\nNew England Metal  Culvert completed  its performance,  i.e.,\n                                                            \n\nmade the December 13  and 15 pipe deliveries, under  a second\n\n                    \n\nSon, Inc., slip op. at 7.\n         \n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\ncontract which required completion of  the performance called\n\nfor under the original contract.  Id. at 714.\n                                     \n\n          Although  New  England  Metal  Culvert  involves  a\n                                                \n\nstatutory notice  requirement, as  opposed  to a  contractual\n\nrequirement,  we can  see  no reason  why  the New  Hampshire\n\nSupreme Court's interpretation of  the former would not apply\n\nto the latter.  See, e.g., Raitt v. National Grange Ins. Co.,\n                                                            \n\n285 A.2d 799  (N.H. 1971) (contractual subrogation  provision\n\nconstrued consistently with  identical statutory  subrogation\n\nright).  In  fact, the  notice requirement at  issue here  is\n\nidentical  to the Miller Act's ninety-day notice requirement,\n\nand  the New Hampshire Supreme Court has looked to Miller Act\n\ncases in construing the  pre-amendment version of RSA 447:17.\n\nSee  New  England Metal  Culvert,  196  A.2d at  715  (citing\n                                \n\ncases).\n\n          Aside  from the two  New Hampshire  cases discussed\n\nabove,  the parties  have focussed  their attention  on cases\n\nconstruing  the ninety-day  notice requirement in  the Miller\n\nAct,  40 U.S.C.   270b(a).  Because we have found controlling\n\nprecedent under  New Hampshire  law, we need  not delve  into\n\nthese cases.  Nevertheless, we note that the Miller Act cases\n\nare not hostile to our holding.\n\n          On   the  question   of  ninety-day   gaps  between\n\nperformances,  we have  uncovered  only a  handful of  cases.\n\nThose cases have held, where there is a break of greater than\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nninety  days between  deliveries under  a series  of purchase\n                                                             \n\norders,  that the last delivery does not resurrect claims for\n      \n\npayment for  the earlier  deliveries.   See United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nPeter  Reiss  Constr.  Co.,  273  F.2d  880  (2d  Cir.  1959)\n                          \n\n(Friendly,  J.).  This was essentially the issue in Cray, and\n                                                        \n\nthe court there reached  the same conclusion.  Of  course, in\n\nCray,  the  plaintiff never  made  any  deliveries after  the\n    \n\nninety-day plus hiatus.   On  the other hand,  where work  is\n\nperformed  under a  contract,  as  opposed  to  a  series  of\n\npurchase  orders,  a  greater  than  ninety-day  interval  in\n\nperformances will not bar recovery on the earlier performance\n\ndespite the absence  of immediate  notice.  See  Id. at  882;\n                                                    \n\nUnited States v. Chester  Constr. Co., 104 F.2d 648  (2d Cir.\n                                     \n\n1939).   This was the situation in New England Metal Culvert,\n                                                            \n\nand the New Hampshire Supreme Court reached the same result.\n\n          The three Miller Act  cases relied on by defendants\n\nin  their brief would not warrant a contrary conclusion.  The\n\nfirst  case,  United States  ex rel.  J.A.  Edwards &amp;  Co. v.\n                                                          \n\nThompson  Constr.  Corp.,  273   F.2d  873  (2d  Cir.  1959),\n                        \n\nconcerned the substance of a notice of claim under the Miller\n\nAct,  not   its  timeliness   under  the   ninety-day  notice\n\nrequirement.  And the  last two cases, United States  ex rel.\n                                                             \n\nJohn D. Ahern Co. v. J.F.

The district court, after an evidentiary hearing, held that the notice was timely and therefore granted judgment for plaintiff-appellee Brox Industries in the amount of $178,155.86.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set forth a summary of the pertinent facts found by the district court.  In June 1991 defendant-appellant H.J. Stabile &amp; Son, Inc. entered into a contract with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. to build a store in Seabrook, New Hampshire.  In July 1991 Stabile obtained a payment bond from co-defendant-appellant Reliance Insurance Company.  Reliance, of course, is the real party in interest.  Stabile subsequently subcontracted with Atom Contracting Corp. to do work on the Wal-Mart project.  Atom then subcontracted with Brox to do both on-site and off-site paving.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Stabile's contract with Wal-Mart all work was to be completed on the project by December 3, 1991.  By mid-December Brox had not completed a substantial portion of the paving work under its contract with Atom.  On December 13 Stabile instructed Brox that it should cease operations on the project due to the onset of winter.  Because all of the parties recognized that paving cannot be done properly in the winter, they agreed that Brox would return the following spring to complete the work.  Stabile fully expected that Brox would return to the work-site in the spring, and Brox anticipated doing so.  On December 23, 1991 Brox notified Stabile that substantial work remained for the spring, provided Stabile with an estimate of the remaining work, and stated that the total amount of the paving work performed to date was $201,106.50.  Brox invoiced Atom for this work in December 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February and March 1992, in response to concerns of Wal-Mart about the quality of Brox's paving, Brox conducted tests of its work.  Also in March 1992, a Brox employee filled in several potholes at the worksite in preparation for returning to the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By March of 1992 Stabile had paid Atom all sums due for work performed by Atom and its subcontractors, including Brox.  Atom, however, still owed Brox $178,155.86 for work done through December 13, 1991.  On March 18, 1992 Brox sent a notice of claim for that amount to Reliance as surety for Stabile.  Nonetheless, Brox anticipated that it would finish the paving work in the spring under its contract with Atom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 14, 1992 Atom informed Stabile that it intended to honor their contract, and that the State of New Hampshire wanted two roads, which were contiguous to the planned store, to be paved by June 1. On June 4 Stabile agreed to the additional paving with a charge back to Atom.  Although the specifics are unclear, shortly thereafter Stabile recognized that Atom would be unable to meet its contractual obligations, and therefore it sought to engage a new contractor to complete the paving work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 11, after a brief bidding period, Stabile and Brox entered into two contracts for the completion of the paving at the project, one for on-site and one for off-site work.  On June 30 Stabile formally terminated its contract with Atom.  Brox finished the paving work at the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1992 Brox commenced a diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire against Stabile and Reliance seeking payment under the bond issued by Reliance as surety for Stabile.  Under the bond, a party not in direct privity with the principal, such as Brox, must give notice of its claim to:  the Principal, the Surety, or the Owner, \"within ninety (90) days after such claimant did or performed the last of the work or labor, or furnished the last of the materials for which said claim is made.\"  No claim is made that Brox failed to give notice as required to the Principal, Surety or Owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal defense of Stabile and Reliance is that Brox's March 18, 1992 notice was untimely under the bond's requirements.  Brox moved for summary judgment based on two alternative theories.  It argued first that, assuming arguendo that its notice was untimely, Reliance must show prejudice from the tardiness in order to bar recovery under the bond.  According to Brox, no prejudice could be shown.  Alternatively, Brox maintained that its notice was timely under the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in an opinion dated August 18, 1993, found that Brox's notice was timely.  According to the district court, \"[t]he crux of the case ... appears to be whether [Brox's] work [was] completed in December, 1991.\"  Brox Industries, Inc. v. H.J. Stabile &amp; Son, Inc., No. 92-426-L, slip op. at 6 (D.N.H. August 18, 1993).  At the evidentiary hearing the court stated that \"[i]f ... an agreement [about a winter hiatus] was made then clearly [Brox's] work under its subcontract with Atom was not completed on December 13, 1991 and [Brox's] failure to give notice within ninety days of that day would not bar recovery under the bond.\"  Because the court eventually found that Brox still had substantial work to do on the contract as of December 13, and that the parties agreed to a winter hiatus of greater than ninety days, it held that Brox's notice was not untimely.  Id. at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Brox's argument that work done at the project site in February and March 1992, i.e., quality tests and pothole repairs, reset the ninety-day notice period, the district court found that both the tests and the pothole repairs were remedial in nature and did not \"advance the completion of the project.\"  Id. at 5. Accordingly, under New Hampshire law, the district court found that the above work had no effect upon the ninety-day notice period.   See Tolles-Bickford Co. v. School, 94 A.2d 374 (N.H. 1953).  This conclusion and its predicate factual findings have not been appealed.  The court entered judgment for Brox for the full amount of its claim, and defendants appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The focus of this litigation has been twofold:  (1) whether, given the circumstances surrounding Brox's work on the project, its notice of March 18, 1992 was timely under the bond issued by Reliance;  and (2) whether, if the notice was not timely, Reliance must demonstrate prejudice from the delay in order to bar Brox's recovery.  Because the district court ruled in the affirmative on the first issue, it never reached the second.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this is a diversity action, the substantive law of the forum attaches.   Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938).  The parties' arguments as to the timeliness of Brox's notice hinge upon two New Hampshire Supreme Court cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In  American Fidelity Co. v. Cray, 194 A.2d 763 (N.H. 1963) a claimant on a payment bond was precluded from recovering due to late notice of claim.  The principal in Cray was under a contract with the State of New Hampshire.  It was required by statute to obtain a contract bond, and the bond's notice requirement was prescribed by statute.  Under the version of N.H. RSA 447:17 in effect at that time, in order to obtain the benefit of the bond, a claimant for labor performed or materials furnished \"shall within ninety days after said claimant ceases to perform said labor or furnish said materials ... file ... with the department of public works and highways ... a statement of the claim.\"  From May to November 1958, Cray provided fuel and lubricants to the principal on a highway construction project.  In late 1958, prior to the completion of the project, the principal shut down the job for the winter.  It never returned.  In the spring of 1959 the surety completed the project through another construction company.  In May 1959 Cray noticed a claim with the proper authority for money owed to it by the principal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Cray did not provide any materials to the principal after November 1958-more than ninety days prior to its filing a claim under the bond-Cray maintained that it did not \"cease\" to furnish fuel and lubricants under the bond at the time of the winter shutdown in November 1958.  Cray argued that its agreement with the principal was a continuing one such that the ninety day notice requirement should have been tolled during the seasonal hiatus.  After reviewing the facts of the case, the New Hampshire Supreme Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot accept Cray's contention that it ceased to furnish materials not in November 1958, after which date no materials were in fact furnished, but the following spring when LaClair failed to resume operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 766.  Defendants argue that Brox is in the same position as Cray was, and that its notice is therefore untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' position is substantially undercut by the New Hampshire Supreme Court's subsequent opinion in  New England Metal Culvert Co. v. A.E. Williams Construction Co., 196 A.2d 713 (N.H. 1963).  In New England Metal Culvert the contractor on a highway construction project placed a single order with the plaintiff in January 1961 for various materials, including a metal culvert and pipe.  As was the case in Cray, the contractor was under contract with the State, and was required by statute to obtain a bond.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Delivery of the pipe was to be \"as required.\"  Id. at 714.  On April 25, 26 and 27, 1961 a metal culvert was delivered, but the contractor was not ready to receive the pipe, and it was not delivered.  In October 1961, after learning that the contractor was in financial straits, the plaintiff filed a notice of claim under the bond for payment of the materials that it had delivered in April.  The contractor subsequently defaulted on the project, and the surety completed construction through a different construction company.  In December 1961 a new construction company was hired by the surety to finish the job.  This new company ordered the exact same pipe from the plaintiff that had been ordered by, but never delivered to, the original contractor.  Id. The pipe was delivered by plaintiff to the new contractor on December 13 and 15, 1961 and was paid for in a timely manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court ruled that plaintiff's October 27, 1961 notice was timely under the pre-amendment version of the notice statute.  Id. at 715.  This conclusion was based on two factors.  First, the contract between plaintiff and the original contractor \"was a single contract although separable or divisible as to deliveries.\"  Id. And second, \"[o]n October, 27, 1961, when the plaintiff first gave notice of its claim, although more than ninety days had elapsed since delivery of the culvert it had not then ceased to furnish materials, but was bound by its [original] contract to make additional deliveries on request.\"  Id. Moreover,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the remaining pipe was furnished to the job on December 13 and 15, 1961 for use in carrying out the contract with the State.  Thus the plaintiff did not cease to furnish materials within the meaning of RSA 447:17 until December 15, 1961.... Unlike the situation in American Fidelity Co. v. Cray, supra, the plaintiff in this case had a single contract for a series of deliveries of specified materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (citation omitted).  The court concluded that \"[a] notice filed within ninety days of the last delivery on December 15, 1961 would have constituted compliance with the requirements of the statute before amendment, and permitted recourse to the bond for recovery of the price of the culvert delivered in April 1961.\"  Id. The court further held that although plaintiff's filing was premature, the premature notice satisfied the notice requirement.  Id. at 716.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brox argues that it is similarly situated to the plaintiff in New England Metal Culvert, and that its notice was therefore timely.  We agree.  As in New England Metal Culvert, Brox had a single contract with Atom.  At the time Brox gave notice of its claim, more than ninety days had passed since its last paving work on the project.  Nevertheless, at the time Brox gave its notice, it was still obligated to complete the paving work after the spring thaw.  Brox eventually completed the paving work necessary for carrying out Stabile's contract with Wal-Mart.  These factors, we believe, place this case squarely under the shadow cast by New England Metal Culvert.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, under the rule articulated by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in New England Metal Culvert, if a claimant is still obligated to perform additional work under its original contract at the time notice is given under a payment bond, such as the one at issue here, the notice is not untimely even if more than ninety days have passed since the last work was performed by the claimant under the original contract.  In effect, the claimant's notice can be viewed as covering the claimant's prior work, for which it has not been paid, as well as the work that it is obligated to perform in the future-work for which it has also not yet been paid.  The ninety-day notice period does not begin to run until the claimant actually completes the work that it was contractually obligated to perform at the time notice was given.  Thus, as the New Hampshire Supreme Court has noted, although the claimant's notice is premature, it is valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument Reliance sought to distinguish New England Metal Culvert on the ground that one contract was at issue in that case whereas two contracts are implicated in the present case.  Defendants' contention is not persuasive.  It is clear, as in the present case, that the plaintiff in New England Metal Culvert completed its performance, i.e., made the December 13 and 15 pipe deliveries, under a second contract which required completion of the performance called for under the original contract.   Id. at 714.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although New England Metal Culvert involves a statutory notice requirement, as opposed to a contractual requirement, we can see no reason why the New Hampshire Supreme Court's interpretation of the former would not apply to the latter.   See, e.g., Raitt v. National Grange Ins. Co., 285 A.2d 799 (N.H. 1971) (contractual subrogation provision construed consistently with identical statutory subrogation right).  In fact, the notice requirement at issue here is identical to the Miller Act's ninety-day notice requirement, and the New</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hampshire Supreme Court has looked to Miller Act cases in construing the pre-amendment version of RSA 447:17.   See New England Metal Culvert, 196 A.2d at 715 (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from the two New Hampshire cases discussed above, the parties have focussed their attention on cases construing the ninety-day notice requirement in the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. Sec. 270b(a).  Because we have found controlling precedent under New Hampshire law, we need not delve into these cases.  Nevertheless, we note that the Miller Act cases are not hostile to our holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the question of ninety-day gaps between performances, we have uncovered only a handful of cases.  Those cases have held, where there is a break of greater than ninety days between deliveries under a series of purchase orders, that the last delivery does not resurrect claims for payment for the earlier deliveries.   See United States v. Peter Reiss Constr.  Co., 273 F.2d 880 (2d Cir. 1959) (Friendly, J.).  This was essentially the issue in Cray, and the court there reached the same conclusion.  Of course, in Cray, the plaintiff never made any deliveries after the ninety-day plus hiatus.  On the other hand, where work is performed under a contract, as opposed to a series of purchase orders, a greater than ninety-day interval in performances will not bar recovery on the earlier performance despite the absence of immediate notice.  See Id. at 882;   United States v. Chester Constr.  Co., 104 F.2d 648(2d</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cir. 1939).  This was the situation in New England Metal Culvert, and the New Hampshire Supreme Court reached the same result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three Miller Act cases relied on by defendants in their brief would not warrant a contrary conclusion.  The first case,  United States ex rel.  J.A. Edwards &amp; Co. v. Thompson Constr.  Corp., 273 F.2d 873 (2d Cir. 1959), concerned the substance of a notice of claim under the Miller Act, not its timeliness under the ninety-day notice requirement.  And the last two cases,  United States ex rel.  John D. Ahern Co. v. J.F. White Contracting Co., 649 F.2d 29 (1st Cir. 1981) and  A.B. Cooley v. Barten &amp; Wood, Inc., 249 F.2d 912 (1st Cir. 1956), although more closely analogous to the instant case, do not involve gaps in the claimant's performance of greater than ninety days, and are therefore of limited relevance.  This is particularly true given the New Hampshire Supreme Court's clear statement in this matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' have failed to identify, and we cannot decipher, any substantive distinction between New England Metal Culvert and the case at bar.

The district court, after an evidentiary hearing, held that the notice was timely and therefore granted judgment for plaintiff-appellee Brox Industries in the amount of $178,155.86.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set forth a summary of the pertinent facts found by the district court.  In June 1991 defendant-appellant H.J. Stabile &amp; Son, Inc. entered into a contract with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. to build a store in Seabrook, New Hampshire.  In July 1991 Stabile obtained a payment bond from co-defendant-appellant Reliance Insurance Company.  Reliance, of course, is the real party in interest.  Stabile subsequently subcontracted with Atom Contracting Corp. to do work on the Wal-Mart project.  Atom then subcontracted with Brox to do both on-site and off-site paving.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Stabile's contract with Wal-Mart all work was to be completed on the project by December 3, 1991.  By mid-December Brox had not completed a substantial portion of the paving work under its contract with Atom.  On December 13 Stabile instructed Brox that it should cease operations on the project due to the onset of winter.  Because all of the parties recognized that paving cannot be done properly in the winter, they agreed that Brox would return the following spring to complete the work.  Stabile fully expected that Brox would return to the work-site in the spring, and Brox anticipated doing so.  On December 23, 1991 Brox notified Stabile that substantial work remained for the spring, provided Stabile with an estimate of the remaining work, and stated that the total amount of the paving work performed to date was $201,106.50.  Brox invoiced Atom for this work in December 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February and March 1992, in response to concerns of Wal-Mart about the quality of Brox's paving, Brox conducted tests of its work.  Also in March 1992, a Brox employee filled in several potholes at the worksite in preparation for returning to the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By March of 1992 Stabile had paid Atom all sums due for work performed by Atom and its subcontractors, including Brox.  Atom, however, still owed Brox $178,155.86 for work done through December 13, 1991.  On March 18, 1992 Brox sent a notice of claim for that amount to Reliance as surety for Stabile.  Nonetheless, Brox anticipated that it would finish the paving work in the spring under its contract with Atom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 14, 1992 Atom informed Stabile that it intended to honor their contract, and that the State of New Hampshire wanted two roads, which were contiguous to the planned store, to be paved by June 1. On June 4 Stabile agreed to the additional paving with a charge back to Atom.  Although the specifics are unclear, shortly thereafter Stabile recognized that Atom would be unable to meet its contractual obligations, and therefore it sought to engage a new contractor to complete the paving work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 11, after a brief bidding period, Stabile and Brox entered into two contracts for the completion of the paving at the project, one for on-site and one for off-site work.  On June 30 Stabile formally terminated its contract with Atom.  Brox finished the paving work at the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1992 Brox commenced a diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire against Stabile and Reliance seeking payment under the bond issued by Reliance as surety for Stabile.  Under the bond, a party not in direct privity with the principal, such as Brox, must give notice of its claim to:  the Principal, the Surety, or the Owner, \"within ninety (90) days after such claimant did or performed the last of the work or labor, or furnished the last of the materials for which said claim is made.\"  No claim is made that Brox failed to give notice as required to the Principal, Surety or Owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal defense of Stabile and Reliance is that Brox's March 18, 1992 notice was untimely under the bond's requirements.  Brox moved for summary judgment based on two alternative theories.  It argued first that, assuming arguendo that its notice was untimely, Reliance must show prejudice from the tardiness in order to bar recovery under the bond.  According to Brox, no prejudice could be shown.  Alternatively, Brox maintained that its notice was timely under the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in an opinion dated August 18, 1993, found that Brox's notice was timely.  According to the district court, \"[t]he crux of the case ... appears to be whether [Brox's] work [was] completed in December, 1991.\"  Brox Industries, Inc. v. H.J. Stabile &amp; Son, Inc., No. 92-426-L, slip op. at 6 (D.N.H. August 18, 1993).  At the evidentiary hearing the court stated that \"[i]f ... an agreement [about a winter hiatus] was made then clearly [Brox's] work under its subcontract with Atom was not completed on December 13, 1991 and [Brox's] failure to give notice within ninety days of that day would not bar recovery under the bond.\"  Because the court eventually found that Brox still had substantial work to do on the contract as of December 13, and that the parties agreed to a winter hiatus of greater than ninety days, it held that Brox's notice was not untimely.  Id. at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Brox's argument that work done at the project site in February and March 1992, i.e., quality tests and pothole repairs, reset the ninety-day notice period, the district court found that both the tests and the pothole repairs were remedial in nature and did not \"advance the completion of the project.\"  Id. at 5. Accordingly, under New Hampshire law, the district court found that the above work had no effect upon the ninety-day notice period.   See Tolles-Bickford Co. v. School, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></span> (N.H. 1953).  This conclusion and its predicate factual findings have not been appealed.  The court entered judgment for Brox for the full amount of its claim, and defendants appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The focus of this litigation has been twofold:  (1) whether, given the circumstances surrounding Brox's work on the project, its notice of March 18, 1992 was timely under the bond issued by Reliance;  and (2) whether, if the notice was not timely, Reliance must demonstrate prejudice from the delay in order to bar Brox's recovery.  Because the district court ruled in the affirmative on the first issue, it never reached the second.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this is a diversity action, the substantive law of the forum attaches.

Tompkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103012\"><a href=\"/opinion/103012/erie-r-co-v-tompkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 78 (1938).  The parties' arguments as to the timeliness of Brox's notice hinge upon two New Hampshire Supreme Court cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In  American Fidelity Co. v. Cray, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></span> (N.H. 1963) a claimant on a payment bond was precluded from recovering due to late notice of claim.  The principal in Cray was under a contract with the State of New Hampshire.  It was required by statute to obtain a contract bond, and the bond's notice requirement was prescribed by statute.  Under the version of N.H. RSA 447:17 in effect at that time, in order to obtain the benefit of the bond, a claimant for labor performed or materials furnished \"shall within ninety days after said claimant ceases to perform said labor or furnish said materials ... file ... with the department of public works and highways ... a statement of the claim.\"  From May to November 1958, Cray provided fuel and lubricants to the principal on a highway construction project.  In late 1958, prior to the completion of the project, the principal shut down the job for the winter.  It never returned.  In the spring of 1959 the surety completed the project through another construction company.  In May 1959 Cray noticed a claim with the proper authority for money owed to it by the principal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Cray did not provide any materials to the principal after November 1958-more than ninety days prior to its filing a claim under the bond-Cray maintained that it did not \"cease\" to furnish fuel and lubricants under the bond at the time of the winter shutdown in November 1958.  Cray argued that its agreement with the principal was a continuing one such that the ninety day notice requirement should have been tolled during the seasonal hiatus.  After reviewing the facts of the case, the New Hampshire Supreme Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot accept Cray's contention that it ceased to furnish materials not in November 1958, after which date no materials were in fact furnished, but the following spring when LaClair failed to resume operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 766.  Defendants argue that Brox is in the same position as Cray was, and that its notice is therefore untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' position is substantially undercut by the New Hampshire Supreme Court's subsequent opinion in  New England Metal Culvert Co. v. A.E. Williams Construction Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></span> (N.H. 1963).  In New England Metal Culvert the contractor on a highway construction project placed a single order with the plaintiff in January 1961 for various materials, including a metal culvert and pipe.  As was the case in Cray, the contractor was under contract with the State, and was required by statute to obtain a bond.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Delivery of the pipe was to be \"as required.\"  Id. at 714.  On April 25, 26 and 27, 1961 a metal culvert was delivered, but the contractor was not ready to receive the pipe, and it was not delivered.  In October 1961, after learning that the contractor was in financial straits, the plaintiff filed a notice of claim under the bond for payment of the materials that it had delivered in April.  The contractor subsequently defaulted on the project, and the surety completed construction through a different construction company.  In December 1961 a new construction company was hired by the surety to finish the job.  This new company ordered the exact same pipe from the plaintiff that had been ordered by, but never delivered to, the original contractor.  Id. The pipe was delivered by plaintiff to the new contractor on December 13 and 15, 1961 and was paid for in a timely manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court ruled that plaintiff's October 27, 1961 notice was timely under the pre-amendment version of the notice statute.  Id. at 715.  This conclusion was based on two factors.  First, the contract between plaintiff and the original contractor \"was a single contract although separable or divisible as to deliveries.\"  Id. And second, \"[o]n October, 27, 1961, when the plaintiff first gave notice of its claim, although more than ninety days had elapsed since delivery of the culvert it had not then ceased to furnish materials, but was bound by its [original] contract to make additional deliveries on request.\"  Id. Moreover,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the remaining pipe was furnished to the job on December 13 and 15, 1961 for use in carrying out the contract with the State.  Thus the plaintiff did not cease to furnish materials within the meaning of RSA 447:17 until December 15, 1961.... Unlike the situation in American Fidelity Co. v. Cray, supra, the plaintiff in this case had a single contract for a series of deliveries of specified materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (citation omitted).  The court concluded that \"[a] notice filed within ninety days of the last delivery on December 15, 1961 would have constituted compliance with the requirements of the statute before amendment, and permitted recourse to the bond for recovery of the price of the culvert delivered in April 1961.\"  Id. The court further held that although plaintiff's filing was premature, the premature notice satisfied the notice requirement.  Id. at 716.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brox argues that it is similarly situated to the plaintiff in New England Metal Culvert, and that its notice was therefore timely.  We agree.  As in New England Metal Culvert, Brox had a single contract with Atom.  At the time Brox gave notice of its claim, more than ninety days had passed since its last paving work on the project.  Nevertheless, at the time Brox gave its notice, it was still obligated to complete the paving work after the spring thaw.  Brox eventually completed the paving work necessary for carrying out Stabile's contract with Wal-Mart.  These factors, we believe, place this case squarely under the shadow cast by New England Metal Culvert.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, under the rule articulated by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in New England Metal Culvert, if a claimant is still obligated to perform additional work under its original contract at the time notice is given under a payment bond, such as the one at issue here, the notice is not untimely even if more than ninety days have passed since the last work was performed by the claimant under the original contract.  In effect, the claimant's notice can be viewed as covering the claimant's prior work, for which it has not been paid, as well as the work that it is obligated to perform in the future-work for which it has also not yet been paid.  The ninety-day notice period does not begin to run until the claimant actually completes the work that it was contractually obligated to perform at the time notice was given.  Thus, as the New Hampshire Supreme Court has noted, although the claimant's notice is premature, it is valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument Reliance sought to distinguish New England Metal Culvert on the ground that one contract was at issue in that case whereas two contracts are implicated in the present case.  Defendants' contention is not persuasive.  It is clear, as in the present case, that the plaintiff in New England Metal Culvert completed its performance, i.e., made the December 13 and 15 pipe deliveries, under a second contract which required completion of the performance called for under the original contract.

See, e.g., Raitt v. National Grange Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></span> (N.H. 1971) (contractual subrogation provision construed consistently with identical statutory subrogation right).  In fact, the notice requirement at issue here is identical to the Miller Act's ninety-day notice requirement, and the New</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hampshire Supreme Court has looked to Miller Act cases in construing the pre-amendment version of RSA 447:17.   See New England Metal Culvert, 196 A.2d at 715 (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from the two New Hampshire cases discussed above, the parties have focussed their attention on cases construing the ninety-day notice requirement in the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. Sec. 270b(a).  Because we have found controlling precedent under New Hampshire law, we need not delve into these cases.  Nevertheless, we note that the Miller Act cases are not hostile to our holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the question of ninety-day gaps between performances, we have uncovered only a handful of cases.  Those cases have held, where there is a break of greater than ninety days between deliveries under a series of purchase orders, that the last delivery does not resurrect claims for payment for the earlier deliveries.   See United States v. Peter Reiss Constr.  Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"249859\"><a href=\"/opinion/249859/united-states-of-america-for-the-use-and-benefit-of-j-a-edwards-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">880</span></a></span> (2d Cir. 1959) (Friendly, J.).  This was essentially the issue in Cray, and the court there reached the same conclusion.  Of course, in Cray, the plaintiff never made any deliveries after the ninety-day plus hiatus.  On the other hand, where work is performed under a contract, as opposed to a series of purchase orders, a greater than ninety-day interval in performances will not bar recovery on the earlier performance despite the absence of immediate notice.  See Id. at 882;   United States v. Chester Constr.  Co., 104 F.2d 648(2d</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cir. 1939).  This was the situation in New England Metal Culvert, and the New Hampshire Supreme Court reached the same result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three Miller Act cases relied on by defendants in their brief would not warrant a contrary conclusion.  The first case,  United States ex rel.  J.A. Edwards &amp; Co. v. Thompson Constr.  Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"249858\"><a href=\"/opinion/249858/united-states-of-america-for-the-use-and-benefit-of-j-a-edwards-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span> (2d Cir. 1959), concerned the substance of a notice of claim under the Miller Act, not its timeliness under the ninety-day notice requirement.  And the last two cases,  United States ex rel.  John D. Ahern Co. v. J.F. White Contracting Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390423\"><a href=\"/opinion/390423/united-states-of-america-for-use-of-john-d-ahern-company-inc-v-j-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">649</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1981) and  A.B. Cooley v. Barten &amp; Wood, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></span> (1st Cir. 1956), although more closely analogous to the instant case, do not involve gaps in the claimant's performance of greater than ninety days, and are therefore of limited relevance.  This is particularly true given the New Hampshire Supreme Court's clear statement in this matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' have failed to identify, and we cannot decipher, any substantive distinction between New England Metal Culvert and the case at bar.
