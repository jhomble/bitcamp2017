Plaintiffs, former employees of Insituform\n          Per Curiam.\n                    \n\nof  New  England,  Inc.  (Insituform), brought  suit  in  Maine's\n\nfederal  district  court  against defendant-appellee  Herbert  T.\n\nSchneider,  the  chief  executive  officer of  Insituform.    The\n\nplaintiffs  filed several  complaints  in rapid  succession, but,\n\neach  time, the defendant prevailed on  a motion to dismiss.  See\n                                                                 \n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Following entry of final judgment, the\n\nplaintiffs appealed.1  We affirm.\n\n          On  appeal, plaintiffs  assign  error  to the  district\n\ncourt's  dismissal of four claims.2  We  need not dally.  We have\n\nrepeatedly  observed that,  when the  trial court  has handled  a\n\nmatter appropriately and adequately articulated a sound basis for\n\nits  rulings,  \"a  reviewing  tribunal  should  hesitate  to  wax\n\nlongiloquent simply to hear its  own words resonate.\"  In re  San\n                                                                 \n\nJuan  DuPont Plaza Hotel Fire  Litig., 989 F.2d  36, 38 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1993).  This  observation has  particular pertinence  here:   not\n\nonly   did  the   magistrate   judge  and   the  district   judge\n\nsatisfactorily explain the reasons why plaintiffs'  third amended\n\ncomplaint fails to state one or more claims upon which relief can\n\n                    \n\n     1There  is  some  confusion  as  to which  counts  of  which\ncomplaints  were dismissed.    At oral  argument  in this  court,\nhowever,   the  parties  stipulated   that  the   judgment  below\nterminated all  claims against Schneider; and  that the operative\ncomplaint,  for purposes  of  this appeal,  is plaintiffs'  third\namended complaint.  We accept the stipulation.\n\n     2The third  amended complaint asserted nine  claims in toto.\n                                                                \nSince  plaintiffs'  brief does  not  address  the remaining  five\nclaims,  the  dismissal of  those claims  must stand.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \nUnited States  v. Slade,  980  F.2d 27,  30 n.3  (1st Cir.  1992)\n                       \n(noting that arguments made below, but not renewed on appeal, are\ndeemed waived).\n\n                                2\n\nbe  granted, but  also,  the case  is  so idiosyncratic  that  it\n\npossesses extremely limited precedential  value.  Accordingly, we\n\naffirm the  dismissal of plaintiffs' third  amended complaint for\n\nsubstantially  the reasons  elucidated  below,  adding,  however,\n\nseveral brief comments.\n\n                                I\n\n          As    to    plaintiffs'    claims     for    fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation, tortious interference, and  unjust enrichment,\n\nwe  rely essentially  upon the  grounds for  dismissal identified\n\nboth  by  the magistrate,  see  Recommended  Decision (Sept.  21,\n                              \n\n1992), and by the  district judge (in the course of  adopting the\n\nmagistrate's  recommendations as  to  those three  counts).   See\n                                                                 \n\nOrder  and Memorandum of Opinion  (Nov. 2, 1992).   We supplement\n\nthese offerings by supplying a few embellishments.\n\n          1.    The  fraudulent  misrepresentation  count  (which\n\npresents perhaps the closest question) still fails, after several\n\nopportunities  to  amend,  to  allege fraud  with  the  requisite\n\nparticularity.  See,  e.g., Greenstone v. Cambex  Corp., 975 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n22, 25-26  (1st Cir. 1992) (discussing need  for specific factual\n\nallegations to particularize claims  for fraud); Powers v. Boston\n                                                                 \n\nCooper  Corp., 926  F.2d  109, 111  (1st  Cir. 1991)  (discussing\n             \n\nspecificity  required in  pleading  fraud);  McGinty v.  Beranger\n                                                                 \n\nVolkswagen, Inc., 633 F.2d 226, 228-29 (1st Cir. 1980) (similar);\n                \n\nsee generally Fed. R. Civ. P.  9(b).  The order for dismissal is,\n             \n\ntherefore, supportable as to this claim.\n\n          2.  The tortious interference count, which asserts that\n\n                                3\n\nthe defendant  wrongly interfered  with plaintiffs'  contracts of\n\nemployment with Insituform,  fails as  a matter of  law.  When  a\n\ncorporate officer  acts in his  official capacity,  his acts,  in\n\nlaw, are acts of  the corporation.  See, e.g.,  DeBrecini v. Graf\n                                                                 \n\nBros. Leasing, Inc.,  828 F.2d  877, 879 (1st  Cir. 1987),  cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 484 U.S. 1064 (1988).  Hence, the weight  of authority is\n      \n\nto the effect  that a  corporate officer can  \"interfere\" with  a\n\ncorporation's  contracts, in  a legally  relevant sense,  only by\n\nconduct undertaken outside, or beyond  the scope of, his official\n\ncapacity.  See, e.g., Michelson v. Exxon Research &amp; Eng. Co., 808\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  1005, 1007-08  (3d  Cir. 1987)  (holding  that a  corporate\n\nofficer  acting in  his  official capacity  could not  tortiously\n\ninterfere with a corporate contract because corporations act only\n\nthrough their officers and agents); Rao v. Rao, 718 F.2d 219, 225\n                                              \n\n(7th  Cir. 1983)  (ruling that  a sole shareholder,  officer, and\n\ndirector  of a  corporation is  not considered  to be  a separate\n\nentity  capable  of  inducing   the  corporation  to  breach  its\n\ncontracts); American Trade Partners,  L.P. v. A-1 Int'l Importing\n                                                                 \n\nEnterps., Ltd., 757 F. Supp. 545, 555 (E.D. Pa. 1991) (explaining\n              \n\nthat,  \"[b]y  definition,  [tortious   interference]  necessarily\n\ninvolves  three parties,\" but, when an  employee is acting within\n\nthe scope of  his authority,  he and his  corporate employer  are\n\nconsidered the same entity); Hickman v. Winston County Hosp. Bd.,\n                                                                \n\n508  So.2d 237,  239  (Ala. 1987)  (holding  that, unless  acting\n\noutside the scope of their employment and with actual malice, the\n\nofficers  of a  corporation cannot  be  held liable  for tortious\n\n                                4\n\ninterferences  with  contracts  to  which the  corporation  is  a\n\nparty); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts   766.  We believe\n                \n\nthat  the Maine courts  would follow this  rule.   And, here, the\n\nvery  thesis of plaintiffs' claim is that Schneider, by virtue of\n                                                                 \n\nhis  controlling position  in  Insituform, caused  Insituform  to\n                                         \n\nunderpay their wages.  This is merely another way  of saying that\n\nplaintiffs'  claim  is  premised  on Schneider's  actions  in  an\n\nofficial capacity.  Ergo, the lower court appropriately dismissed\n\nthe tortious interference count.3\n\n          3.    The  unjust  enrichment  count  founders  because\n\nplaintiffs  neither  explain  how  the  defendant   was  unjustly\n\nenriched,  that is, how Schneider (as  opposed to the corporation\n\nthat  he  allegedly controlled)  personally  benefitted from  the\n                                           \n\npurported underpayment of wages, nor set forth facts from which a\n\nplausible inference  of unjust enrichment  might be drawn.4   The\n\ndefendant's enrichment is, of course, an essential element of the\n\n                    \n\n     3We note, moreover, that plaintiffs have failed to plead the\nelements of a tortious interference claim.  See C.N. Brown Co. v.\n                                                              \nGillen, 569 A.2d 1206, 1210 (Me. 1990) (setting out elements of a\n      \ntortious interference claim).  In particular, they have failed to\nset forth  facts tending to  show that Schneider,  through fraud,\nintimidation,  or  undue  influence,  procured a  breach  of  the\nspecified contracts.   See id. (requiring  demonstration of fraud\n                              \nor its equivalent to bottom a tortious interference claim).\n\n     4A  purely conclusory  statement, contradicted  by the  very\nfacts described  in plaintiffs' complaint,  cannot satisfactorily\nfill  this  void.    See,  e.g.,  Correa-Martinez  v.  Arrillaga-\n                                                                 \nBelendez, 903  F.2d 49, 52-53 (1st Cir. 1990) (in passing on Rule\n        \n12(b)(6)   motion,   a   court   need   not   credit   subjective\ncharacterizations  or  naked  conclusions);  Dartmouth  Review v.\n                                                              \nDartmouth College, 889  F.2d 13, 16  (1st Cir. 1989)  (discussing\n                 \nwhen  \"'conclusions'  become  'facts'  for  pleading  purposes\");\nChongris v.

Hence, absent  some meaningful\n\nbasis  for  an allegation  that  Schneider  himself was  unjustly\n\nenriched, the count  cannot survive.5   See Gooley  v. Mobil  Oil\n                                                                 \n\nCorp., 851 F.2d 513, 515  (1st Cir. 1988) (holding that,  to pass\n     \n\nmuster under Rule  12(b)(6), a complaint must \"set  forth factual\n\nallegations,  either  direct   or  inferential,  respecting  each\n\nmaterial element  necessary to sustain recovery  under [the legal\n\ntheory thought to be actionable]\").\n\n                                II\n\n          This  brings  us to  count  VIII of  the  third amended\n\ncomplaint, which charges Schneider, in his capacity  as a trustee\n\nof  various  corporate  pension and  profit-sharing  plans,  with\n\nviolating a fiduciary duty.  With regard to this count, we affirm\n\nthe  dismissal  substantially  on  the basis  of  District  Judge\n\nBrody's  well-reasoned analysis.    See Order  and Memorandum  of\n                                       \n\nOpinion  (Feb.  17,  1993).    In  the  third  amended complaint,\n\nplaintiffs aver that  \"[c]ontributions to  . . .  the Plans  were\n\nbased  on the  level  of compensation\"  actually paid  to covered\n\n                    \n\n     5The third amended complaint  alleges that Schneider was the\n\"owner\" of Insituform and  \"controlled its operations.\"  However,\nas  painstakingly explicated by the magistrate, plaintiffs allege\nno facts sufficient, under Maine law, to warrant the disregard of\nInsituform's corporate  identity, the  piercing of its  corporate\nveil, or the  imposition of \"alter  ego liability\" on  Schneider,\npersonally.   See Recommended Decision (Sept.  21, 1992), at 6-8,\n                 \nand  cases  cited therein.   Like  the  district judge,  we adopt\nMagistrate Judge Beaulieu's reasoning on this point.\n\n                                6\n\nemployees.  Insituform apparently funded the plans at this level.\n\nThus, even  if defendant,  in his  capacity as  a trustee, had  a\n\nfiduciary  obligation  to collect  required contributions  from a\n\nrecalcitrant employer    a matter on  which we do not  opine   he\n\ndid  not  breach  it,  for the  contributions  matched  the wages\n\nactually paid.   Hence,  dismissal is appropriate  under existing\n                                                                 \n\ncircumstances.\n             \n\n          Nevertheless,  we  need go  further;  the  form of  the\n\ndismissal gives  us pause.   The record reflects  that plaintiffs\n\nare prosecuting a parallel action against Insituform in the state\n\ncourts.    There,  they  allege   among  other  things  that  the\n\ncorporation  underpaid their wages.  Should  they prevail on that\n\ntheory, then, presumably,  benefit plan contributions  would have\n\nto   be  recomputed   based  on   increased  levels   of  covered\n\ncompensation.  And if that circumstance eventuated, the defendant\n\nmight  well be held accountable  if he fails  to take appropriate\n\naction to recover incremental amounts due to the plans.  For this\n\nreason,  we  think that,  unlike the  rest  of the  third amended\n\ncomplaint,  count  VIII ought  not  to have  been  dismissed with\n\nprejudice.  Rather,  it should  have been dismissed  for lack  of\n\nripeness,  without prejudice to the plaintiffs'  right to bring a\n\nfuture suit  to enforce defendant's fiduciary  obligations should\n\nchanged circumstances  (i.e., a  judgment or  settlement revising\n                            \n\nthe historical  payroll and an  ensuing failure to  collect added\n\ncontributions   to  the  plans)   subsequently  justify  such  an\n\ninitiative.  We,  therefore, direct the district court  to modify\n\n                                7\n\nthe final judgment in this single respect.\n\n          Affirmed as modified.

The\n\nplaintiffs  filed several  complaints  in rapid  succession, but,\n\neach  time, the defendant prevailed on  a motion to dismiss.

We have\n\nrepeatedly  observed that,  when the  trial court  has handled  a\n\nmatter appropriately and adequately articulated a sound basis for\n\nits  rulings,  \"a  reviewing  tribunal  should  hesitate  to  wax\n\nlongiloquent simply to hear its  own words resonate.\"  In re  San\n                                                                 \n\nJuan  DuPont Plaza Hotel Fire  Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602834\"><a href=\"/opinion/602834/in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire-litigation-holders-capital/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1993).  This  observation has  particular pertinence  here:   not\n\nonly   did  the   magistrate   judge  and   the  district   judge\n\nsatisfactorily explain the reasons why plaintiffs'  third amended\n\ncomplaint fails to state one or more claims upon which relief can\n\n                    \n\n     1There  is  some  confusion  as  to which  counts  of  which\ncomplaints  were dismissed.    At oral  argument  in this  court,\nhowever,   the  parties  stipulated   that  the   judgment  below\nterminated all  claims against Schneider; and  that the operative\ncomplaint,  for purposes  of  this appeal,  is plaintiffs'  third\namended complaint.  We accept the stipulation.\n\n     2The third  amended complaint asserted nine  claims in toto.\n                                                                \nSince  plaintiffs'  brief does  not  address  the remaining  five\nclaims,  the  dismissal of  those claims  must stand.

Accordingly, we\n\naffirm the  dismissal of plaintiffs' third  amended complaint for\n\nsubstantially  the reasons  elucidated  below,  adding,  however,\n\nseveral brief comments.\n\n                                I\n\n          As    to    plaintiffs'    claims     for    fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation, tortious interference, and  unjust enrichment,\n\nwe  rely essentially  upon the  grounds for  dismissal identified\n\nboth  by  the magistrate,  see  Recommended  Decision (Sept.  21,\n                              \n\n1992), and by the  district judge (in the course of  adopting the\n\nmagistrate's  recommendations as  to  those three  counts).

We believe\n                \n\nthat  the Maine courts  would follow this  rule.   And, here, the\n\nvery  thesis of plaintiffs' claim is that Schneider, by virtue of\n                                                                 \n\nhis  controlling position  in  Insituform, caused  Insituform  to\n                                         \n\nunderpay their wages.  This is merely another way  of saying that\n\nplaintiffs'  claim  is  premised  on Schneider's  actions  in  an\n\nofficial capacity.  Ergo, the lower court appropriately dismissed\n\nthe tortious interference count.3\n\n          3.    The  unjust  enrichment  count  founders  because\n\nplaintiffs  neither  explain  how  the  defendant   was  unjustly\n\nenriched,  that is, how Schneider (as  opposed to the corporation\n\nthat  he  allegedly controlled)  personally  benefitted from  the\n                                           \n\npurported underpayment of wages, nor set forth facts from which a\n\nplausible inference  of unjust enrichment  might be drawn.4   The\n\ndefendant's enrichment is, of course, an essential element of the\n\n                    \n\n     3We note, moreover, that plaintiffs have failed to plead the\nelements of a tortious interference claim.  See C.N.

Insituform apparently funded the plans at this level.\n\nThus, even  if defendant,  in his  capacity as  a trustee, had  a\n\nfiduciary  obligation  to collect  required contributions  from a\n\nrecalcitrant employer    a matter on  which we do not  opine   he\n\ndid  not  breach  it,  for the  contributions  matched  the wages\n\nactually paid.   Hence,  dismissal is appropriate  under existing\n                                                                 \n\ncircumstances.\n             \n\n          Nevertheless,  we  need go  further;  the  form of  the\n\ndismissal gives  us pause.   The record reflects  that plaintiffs\n\nare prosecuting a parallel action against Insituform in the state\n\ncourts.    There,  they  allege   among  other  things  that  the\n\ncorporation  underpaid their wages.  Should  they prevail on that\n\ntheory, then, presumably,  benefit plan contributions  would have\n\nto   be  recomputed   based  on   increased  levels   of  covered\n\ncompensation.  And if that circumstance eventuated, the defendant\n\nmight  well be held accountable  if he fails  to take appropriate\n\naction to recover incremental amounts due to the plans.  For this\n\nreason,  we  think that,  unlike the  rest  of the  third amended\n\ncomplaint,  count  VIII ought  not  to have  been  dismissed with\n\nprejudice.  Rather,  it should  have been dismissed  for lack  of\n\nripeness,  without prejudice to the plaintiffs'  right to bring a\n\nfuture suit  to enforce defendant's fiduciary  obligations should\n\nchanged circumstances  (i.e., a  judgment or  settlement revising\n                            \n\nthe historical  payroll and an  ensuing failure to  collect added\n\ncontributions   to  the  plans)   subsequently  justify  such  an\n\ninitiative.  We,  therefore, direct the district court  to modify\n\n                                7\n\nthe final judgment in this single respect.\n\n          Affirmed as modified.  Costs to appellee.\n                                                  \n\n                                8\n</pre>",
