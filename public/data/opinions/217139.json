In September 2005, American\n\nAirlines, Inc. (\"American\") began charging passengers a fee of $2\n\nfor each bag checked with porters who provide curbside service\n\n(called    \"skycaps\")   at    Boston's   Logan    Airport.      Arguing   that\n\npassengers mistook the fee for a mandatory gratuity for the skycaps\n\nand stopped tipping, several porters brought suit against American;\n\nthe present appeal is a product of that litigation.            The facts and\n\nproceedings are as follows.\n\n            Some passengers at Logan carry their own luggage into the\n\nairport and some have it brought inside to the counter by skycaps,\n\nbut a great many check their luggage onto flights at curbside;\n\nordinarily, the skycap will take the luggage from the curb, write\n\nup the baggage tags, and place the luggage on a conveyer belt\n\ndestined for the airline cargo facilities. Prior to 2005, American\n\nmade skycap services available to its customers free of charge--\n\nbeyond the plane fare--with the airline bearing the cost of skycap\n\nlabor and other facilities involved in curbside check-in (conveyer\n\nbelts, rent for space).\n\n            American once itself employed skycaps to provide these\n\nservices    to   passengers    but   now,   at   least   in   Boston,   relies\n\nprimarily on contractors--most recently, a company called G2 Secure\n\nStaff, LLC (\"G2\"). Although all the American and G2 skycaps earned\n\nan hourly wage, their main source of income was tips.                      The\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcustomary gratuity at Logan Airport was about $1 per bag, and\n\nnearly all passengers tipped.\n\n           In   early   2005,   one   of    American's    competitors    began\n\ncharging a curbside check-in fee in Seattle.             American tested the\n\nidea there before expanding the practice to other cities across the\n\ncountry.   Separate charges for services that had once been bundled\n\ntogether--for example, for in-flight meals or extra bags--were\n\nbecoming common in airline operations during this period.               Due to\n\nderegulation, airline fares had fallen on many major routes,\n\nairlines were suffering low profits or losses, and separate charges\n\nwere one of the responses.\n\n           Like its competitors, American set the price for curbside\n\ncheck-in at $2 per bag, with an initial goal of merely offsetting\n\nthe expense of providing skycap service.           Revenues from the fee\n\nproved more than enough to recoup those costs, and American netted\n\na substantial profit from the charge.           In cities where American\n\nrelied on contractors to provide skycap services, the airline and\n\nthe contractor shared the proceeds from the new charge.            At Logan,\n\nsixty percent went to the airline and forty percent to G2.\n\n           As for the skycaps, American knew that the new fee would\n\nlessen tip income from passengers at least temporarily; in fact,\n\nsome hourly salaries for the G2 skycaps at Logan airport were\n\nraised to comply with minimum wage laws in light of reduced tips.\n\nThe skycaps were required to collect the $2 fee in cash to be\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fturned over to the airline at the end of the business day; they\n\nwere not supposed to solicit tips, although some apparently did;\n\nbut they were free, if the customer inquired, to say that the fee\n\nwas not a gratuity.\n\n          When it instituted the fee at Logan in September 2005,\n\nAmerican notified its customers of the new charge on its website as\n\nwell as on three large, poster-size signs adjacent to the bag-check\n\npodiums outside the airport terminal.         A typical sign, in its\n\noriginal format, read as follows:\n\n                              Curbside\n\n                              Check-In\n\n                        U.S. Domestic Flights\n\n                             $2 Per Bag\n\n                          American Airlines\n\n          Within a week or two, skycaps had added notations to the\n\nofficial signs saying \"gratuity not included\" or words to this\n\neffect, and American then revised its standard posters to include\n\nthis caveat--placed in considerably smaller lettering immediately\n\nbelow the fee itself.    By October 14, 2005, American had ordered\n\nseveral hundred signs with this revised language for use across the\n\ncountry; the website, which referred only to the $2 per bag charge,\n\nwas not altered.   In Boston, four of the modified signs were posted\n\nat the skycap podiums and along the curbside.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f               The skycaps' tip income fell significantly once the new\n\ncharge began.        Some passengers likely thought that $2 per bag was\n\nenough to pay and chose not to tip, but others interpreted the $2\n\nfee as a mandatory tip to the skycap rather than a charge paid to\n\nthe airline.          Confusion persisted despite modification of the\n\nsigns: the curbside can be hectic at busy times; there were other\n\nunrelated signs; and some luggage was collected far from the\n\nsignage, down the line of parked cars and taxis.\n\n               In December 2006, two skycaps at Logan, Don DiFiore and\n\nLeon       Bailey,   brought   a   putative   class   action   against     G2   and\n\nAmerican in Massachusetts Superior Court, which the defendants\n\nremoved       to   federal   district   court   on    the   basis   of   diversity\n\njurisdiction.        The claims against G2 were dismissed in light of an\n\narbitration agreement, and class certification was denied.                  Eight\n\nmore skycap plaintiffs joined the suit against American,1 and the\n\ncomplaint was twice amended.\n\n               By the time of the third amended complaint--now the\n\noperative pleading--the claims against American were these: that\n\nAmerican's curbside check-in fee violated a Massachusetts statute\n\ngoverning tips, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 152A (2008); that the\n\nairline's conduct created liability under state common law as\n\n\n\n       1\n      Of the ten, one skycap was directly employed by American at\nLogan, seven skycaps were employed by G2 at Logan, one skycap had\nformerly been employed by G2 at Logan, and one skycap was employed\nby American in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n                                        -6-\n\ftortious   interference      with    advantageous     relations,       unlawful\n\nconversion, and unjust enrichment; and that the skycaps were\n\nentitled to restitution under principles of quantum meruit.\n\n           The tips law is the centerpiece of the appeal and its\n\npertinent language provides that \"[n]o employer or other person\n\nshall demand . . . or accept from any . . . service employee . . .\n\nany payment or deduction from a tip or service charge given to such\n\n. . . service employee . . . by a patron.\"             Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n149, § 152A(b).      The skycaps qualified as \"service employees\" for\n\npurposes of the statute.      Id. § 152A(a).      The term \"service charge\"\n\nis defined as\n\n           a fee charged by an employer to a patron in\n           lieu of a tip to any . . . service employee\n           . . . including any fee designated as a\n           service charge, tip, gratuity, or a fee that a\n           patron or other consumer would reasonably\n           expect to be given to a . . . service employee\n           . . . in lieu of, or in addition to, a tip.\n\nId.    The gravamen of the tips law claim is that the $2 fee is a\n\n\"service charge\" under state law (and must therefore go to the\n\nskycaps) because customers \"reasonably expect[ed]\" it to be given\n\nto the skycaps.\n\n           American moved to dismiss the complaint, or alternatively\n\nfor summary judgment, principally on the ground that the claims\n\nwere   barred   by   the   express   preemption    clause   of   the    Airline\n\nDeregulation Act: no state may \"enact or enforce a law, regulation,\n\nor other provision having the force and effect of law related to a\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fprice,    route,   or    service    of   an    air    carrier.\"       49    U.S.C.   §\n\n41713(b)(1) (2006).        Judge Young denied the motion, DiFiore v. Am.\n\nAirlines, Inc., 483 F. Supp. 2d 121, 128 (D. Mass. 2007), but later\n\ngranted    summary      judgment    to   American      on   the   quantum    meruit,\n\nconversion, and unjust enrichment counts--theories not pursued on\n\nappeal.\n\n            The claim for recovery under the tips law, Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 149, § 152A(f), and the tortious-interference claim were\n\nboth tried to a jury in March and April 2008.                     The jury awarded\n\neach Logan skycap plaintiff $2 per bag checked at curbside by that\n\nskycap from September 2005 to the start of trial, \"plus fees\n\ncollected in March and April 2008\" during the trial.                  The St. Louis\n\nskycap--not covered by the Massachusetts tips law and bringing only\n\na   tortious-interference      claim     under       Missouri     law--was   awarded\n\nnothing and has not appealed.\n\n            For    those    Logan    skycaps     who    claimed     both     tortious\n\ninterference and a violation of the tips statute, the jury awarded\n\nidentical damages on both theories.2             The district court construed\n\nstate law as permitting the jury to award treble damages, see Mass.\n\n\n\n      2\n      The district court permitted only seven of the nine Logan\nskycaps to pursue both theories at trial. During discovery, two\nskycaps asserted their privilege against self-incrimination to\nwithhold their tax records; those two skycaps were precluded from\npresenting evidence of damages that would have been required to\nmake out a claim for tortious interference. The district court\nalso made clear to the jury that no duplicative recovery would be\npermitted for skycaps who prevailed on both theories.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fGen. Laws Ann. ch. 149, § 150 (West 2004) (amended 2008); Wiedmann\n\nv. Bradford Grp., Inc., 831 N.E.2d 304, 313 (Mass. 2005), but the\n\njury declined to award anything on this account.\n\n           Thereafter the district court temporarily set aside the\n\njury award but reinstated it after the state's highest court\n\nanswered a certified question--not germane to the disputed issues\n\non this appeal--involving the interpretation of the tips statute.\n\nDiFiore v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 910 N.E.2d 889, 891 (Mass. 2009).\n\nFurther post-trial motions led to another opinion rejecting the\n\npreemption claim, DiFiore v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 688 F. Supp. 2d\n\n15, 23-24 (D. Mass. 2009), and determining damages for the period\n\nof March and April 2008, id. at 25-26.\n\n           A final amended judgment gave the nine prevailing skycaps\n\n$333,464   plus   prejudgment    interest;   the    court   also   awarded\n\nattorneys' fees and costs.         American now appeals on multiple\n\ngrounds; the successful skycap plaintiffs cross-appeal, arguing\n\nthat the tips statute award should have been trebled.         The central\n\nissue, federal preemption, is a question of statutory construction\n\nthat we review de novo.         United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-\n\nGalarza, 318 F.3d 323, 330 (1st Cir. 2003).        That it is a difficult\n\none is confirmed by decisions conflicting with that of Judge Young\n\nby two other judges in the same district court.3\n\n\n     3\n      See Brown v. United Air Lines, Inc., 656 F. Supp. 2d 244,\n249-51 (D. Mass. 2009) (Gertner, J.) (holding tips law preempted);\nTravers v. JetBlue Airways Corp., No. 08-cv-10730, 2009 WL 2242391,\n\n                                   -9-\n\f              The Airline Deregulation Act was enacted in 1978 as part\n\nof a wave of deregulatory measures adopted in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nPrior airline regulation based on a public utility model had\n\nproduced good service but at relatively high prices--high, at\n\nleast, compared to much lower fares that emerged under competition.\n\nTo assure that the new regime was not trammeled by state re-\n\nregulation, the 1978 statute preempted state laws \"relating to\n\nrates, routes, or services.\"          Pub. L. No. 95-504, § 4(a), 92 Stat.\n\n1705, 1707-08 (1978) (codified at 49 U.S.C. app. § 1305(a)(1)\n\n(1982)); see also New Eng. Legal Found. v. Mass. Port Auth., 883\n\nF.2d 157, 173 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n              When   Congress   later    recodified    Title   49,   the   1978\n\npreemption language was relocated in the same Title (to section\n\n41713) and slightly rephrased to cover all state laws \"related to\n\na price, route, or service,\" Pub. L. No. 103-272, § 1(e), 108 Stat.\n\n745,   1143    (1994),   but    the   changes   were   stylistic     and   \"not\n\nintend[ed] to impair the applicability of prior judicial case law\n\ninterpreting these provisions,\" H.R. Rep. No. 103-677, at 83 (1994)\n\n(Conf. Rep.), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1715, 1755.                   That\n\nConference Report concerned a new statute carrying over the same\n\n\n\nat *2-3 (D. Mass. July 23, 2009) (O'Toole, J.) (same); see also\nThompson v. U.S. Airways, Inc., 717 F. Supp. 2d 468, 477-79 (E.D.\nPa. 2010) (finding no preemption of Pennsylvania tips statute and\ncommon law claims); Jones v. Am. Airlines, Inc., No. 5:08-cv-236,\nslip op. at 11-13 (E.D.N.C. Oct. 15, 2008) (same, for North\nCarolina common law claims).\n\n                                      -10-\n\fpreemption phrasing to apply it to motor carriers and certain air\n\ncarriers functioning as motor carriers.4\n\n           Case law is especially important in interpreting section\n\n41713 because Congress' language in the preemption section--always\n\nthe first resort in construing a federal statute--is broad but\n\nvague.    A trio of Supreme Court cases have addressed and applied\n\nthe   statutory    provision      in   question:   Morales   v.    Transworld\n\nAirlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374 (1992), American Airlines, Inc. v.\n\nWolens, 513 U.S. 219 (1995), and Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor\n\nTransport Ass'n, 552 U.S. 364 (2008).         Although helpful in marking\n\nout results, none provides an easily applied test.\n\n           The difficulty is that the key connector in the statute--\n\n\"related to\"--is highly elastic, Morales, 504 U.S. at 383-84, and\n\nso of limited help, given that countless state laws have some\n\nrelation to the operations of airlines and thus some potential\n\neffect on the prices charged or services provided. Equally general\n\nis the gloss supplied by the cases of a \"'significant impact'\n\nrelated    to   Congress'      deregulatory    and     pre-emption    related\n\nobjectives,\"      rather   than    one    merely     \"tenuous,    remote,   or\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994,\nPub. L. No. 103-305, § 601(b)-(c), 108 Stat. 1569, 1605-06 (now\ncodified at 49 U.S.C. §§ 14501(c)(1), 41713(b)(4)). Courts have\nconstrued the two statutes in pari materia and have cited\nprecedents concerning either act interchangeably, see United Parcel\nServ., 318 F.3d at 334-35 & n.17, as we do in this decision.\n\n                                       -11-\n\fperipheral.\"       Rowe, 552 U.S. at 371 (quoting Morales, 504 U.S. at\n\n390).\n\n               The statutory preemption language might have been read to\n\ntarget only state enactments focusing solely on airlines, but that\n\nreading has been twice rejected by the Supreme Court.           Wolens, 513\n\nU.S. at 227-28; Morales, 504 U.S. at 386.            Similarly, preemption\n\nmight have been confined to state laws that themselves aimed at\n\neconomic regulation as opposed to other state interests,5 but that\n\ncourse too has been foreclosed.        Rowe, 552 U.S. at 373-76.       So we\n\nare left to triangulate from the results in the leading Supreme\n\nCourt       decisions--Morales,   Wolens,   and   Rowe--with   some   limited\n\nassistance from circuit court decisions.\n\n               All three of the major Supreme Court cases endorsed\n\npreemption and read the preemption language broadly, e.g., Rowe,\n\n552 U.S. at 370-71; Morales, 504 U.S. at 383-84, and none adopted\n\nplaintiffs' position in this case that we should presume strongly\n\nagainst preempting in areas historically occupied by state law, see\n\ne.g., Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. v. Norris, 512 U.S. 246, 252 (1994).\n\nThe state laws preempted in Morales, Wolens, and Rowe involved\n\n\n\n        5\n      Thus, the House Committee report on the 1978 statute said\nthat the preemption clause was drafted to eliminate \"uncertainties\nand conflicts\" over federal and state rate-regulating authority,\nincluding situations in which carriers had been forced to charge\ndifferent rates to passengers traveling between the same two\ncities, depending on whether those passengers' entire itineraries\ninvolved intrastate or interstate travel.

But it is hard to\n\nimagine that Congress would have been happier if, absent detailed\n\nguidelines or a law targeting carriers, the states in Morales,\n\nWolens, and Rowe simply let the jury condemn the same carrier\n\nconduct   by    applying      broader    statutory       terms    (e.g.,      \"unfair\"\n\ncompetition or \"deceptive\" practices, Wolens, 513 U.S. at 227).\n\n            However,      there   also    exists     a   set     of   circuit    cases\n\ndeclining to preempt state anti-discrimination6 and retaliation\n\nlaws,7 as well as one case declining to preempt state prevailing\n\n\n     6\n      E.g., Wellons v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., 165 F.3d 493, 496 (6th\nCir. 1999) (race discrimination); Parise v. Delta Airlines, Inc.,\n141 F.3d 1463, 1466 (11th Cir. 1998) (age discrimination); Abdu-\nBrisson v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 128 F.3d 77, 83-84 (2d Cir. 1997)\n(same); Aloha Islandair Inc. v. Tseu, 128 F.3d 1301, 1303 (9th Cir.\n1997) (disability discrimination).\n     7\n      E.g., Gary v. Air Grp., Inc., 397 F.3d 183, 189 (3d Cir.\n2005) (retaliation for reporting safety violation); Branche v.\nAirtran Airways, Inc., 342 F.3d 1248, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 2003)\n(same), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1182 (2004); Anderson v. Am.\nAirlines, Inc., 2 F.3d 590, 597-98 (5th Cir. 1993) (retaliation for\nfiling workers' compensation claim).\n\n                                         -13-\n\fwage laws, Californians for Safe & Competitive Dump Truck Transp.\n\nv. Mendonca, 152 F.3d 1184, 1189 (9th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526\n\nU.S. 1060 (1999).          Negligence claims have been upheld against\n\nairlines       for   injuries     occurring     during     airline   operations\n\nthemselves,8 and the Ninth Circuit has even held possible a claim\n\nthat might entail a rearrangement of cabin seating to reduce the\n\nrisk of deep vein thrombosis, Montalvo v. Spirit Airlines, 508 F.3d\n\n464, 474-75 (9th Cir. 2007).            But see Witty v. Delta Air Lines,\n\nInc., 366 F.3d 380, 383 (5th Cir. 2004).\n\n               These circuit cases confirm our view that the Supreme\n\nCourt would be unlikely--with some possible qualifications--to free\n\nairlines from most conventional common law claims for tort, from\n\nprevailing wage laws, and ordinary taxes applicable to other\n\nbusinesses.      Yet such measures must impact airline operations--and\n\nso, indirectly, may affect fares and services.               And the tips law,\n\nlike       prevailing   wage    laws,   is   aimed   at    protecting   employee\n\ncompensation.\n\n               The   dividing    line   turns   on   the    statutory   language\n\n\"related to a price, route, or service.\" Importantly, the tips law\n\ndoes more than simply regulate the employment relationship between\n\n\n       8\n      E.g., Charas v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 160 F.3d 1259,\n1261-62, 1266 (9th Cir. 1998) (en banc) (various personal injuries\nincurred onboard and while boarding); Hodges v. Delta Airlines,\nInc., 44 F.3d 334, 338 (5th Cir. 1995) (en banc) (injury by cargo\nfalling from overhead bin); cf. Wolens, 513 U.S. at 231 n.7 (noting\nairline's concession at oral argument that torts arising from\nnegligent operations would generally escape preemption).\n\n                                        -14-\n\fthe skycaps and the airline; unlike the cited circuit cases, the\n\ntips law has a direct connection to air carrier prices and services\n\nand can fairly be said to regulate both.                As to the latter,\n\nAmerican's conduct in arranging for transportation of bags at\n\ncurbside    into   the    airline   terminal    en   route   to   the   loading\n\nfacilities is itself a part of the \"service\" referred to in the\n\nfederal statute, and the airline's \"price\" includes charges for\n\nsuch ancillary services as well as the flight itself.\n\n            This view depends on reading \"price\" to include more than\n\nthe ticket price and \"service\" to include steps that occur before\n\nand after the airplane is actually taxiing or in flight.                On these\n\nissues the lower court decisions have not been uniform.9                But this\n\ndispute has been superceded by controlling Supreme court case law--\n\nnamely, by Rowe's expansive treatment of the term \"service.\"                Air\n\nTransp. Ass'n, 520 F.3d at 223 (citing Rowe, 552 U.S. at 376).              The\n\nweight     of   circuit    court    authority   now    favors     the   broader\n\ndefinition.     See id. (collecting cases).\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      Compare Air Transp. Ass'n of Am. v. Cuomo, 520 F.3d 218, 222\n(2d Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (defining \"service\" for purposes of the\npreemption clause to \"encompass[] matters such as boarding\nprocedures, baggage handling, and food and drink--matters\nincidental to and distinct from the actual transportation of\npassengers\"), with Charas, 160 F.3d at 1261 (defining \"service\" as\n\"the prices, schedules, origins and destinations of the point-to-\npoint transportation of passengers, cargo, or mail\" but not \"an\nairline's provision of in-flight beverages, personal assistance to\npassengers, the handling of luggage, and similar amenities\").\n\n                                     -15-\n\f          Thus, the tips law as applied here directly regulates how\n\nan airline service is performed and how its price is displayed to\n\ncustomers--not merely how the airline behaves as an employer or\n\nproprietor.   To avoid having state law deem the curbside check-in\n\nfee a \"service charge\" would require changes in the way the service\n\nis provided or advertised.   Much of the trial below turned on the\n\nsize of type stating the charge, the visibility of the posters,\n\nwhat customers could and would be told by the skycaps, and whether\n\nthe airline should provide credit card machines that would more\n\nclearly distinguish the charge as a payment to the airline.\n\n          Thus, in application, the Massachusetts tips statute,\n\nalthough mediated by a jury, has the same potential impact on\n\nAmerican's practices as a guideline condemning the same conduct\n\nexplicitly.    If anything, the problem of diverse regimes is even\n\ngreater than merely allowing fifty states to impose restrictions of\n\ntheir own.    In Massachusetts, individual juries would effectively\n\ndesign their own detailed, ad hoc compliance schemes based on the\n\nsize, location and wording of the signs posted by the airline.10\n\n          The Supreme Court has also said that federal preemption\n\ndoes not reach state laws that have only \"tenuous, remote, or\n\n\n\n     10\n      It is worth noting that, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly\nemphasized, the federal Department of Transportation \"retains\nauthority to investigate unfair and deceptive practices and unfair\nmethods of competition by airlines, and may order an airline to\ncease and desist from such practices or methods of competition.\"\nWolens, 513 U.S. at 223 n.4; see also Morales, 504 U.S. at 390-91.\n\n                                -16-\n\fperipheral\" impact.    Rowe, 552 U.S. at 371 (quoting Morales, 504\n\nU.S. at 390).     The plaintiffs claim that the effect of the\n\nMassachusetts tips statute on prices and services is tenuous in\n\nthis case, because the airline could comply with the state law\n\nwithout incurring great expense or substantially altering the gist\n\nof curbside check-in service.    Their proposed remedies include:\n\n          •       Posting more signs in more prominent places\n          •       Using larger font on the signs\n          •       Modifying the American website to mention tips\n          •       Permitting credit-card payments\n          •       Installing a cash register at the curbside\n          •       Re-bundling the cost of curbside check-in into\n                  ticket prices\n\n          This, to borrow an apt airplane image, is walking into a\n\nrotating propeller: the advertising and service arrangements are\n\njust what Congress did not want states regulating, whether at high\n\ncost or at low.       When the Supreme Court invoked the rubric\n\n(\"tenuous, remote, or peripheral\"), it used as examples limitations\n\non gambling, prostitution, or smoking in public places--state\n\nregulation comparatively remote to the transportation function.\n\nSee Morales, 504 U.S. at 390; Rowe, 552 U.S. at 371, 375.\n\n          Worse still, even if American took all of the steps\n\nlisted (save the last), it could hardly be sure that it would be\n\nsafe in imposing the $2 fee.   A jury might still conclude that some\n\npassengers would believe the $2, approximating what passengers\n\nmight expect to tip, was destined for the skycaps themselves.    As\n\nfor the last suggestion, that step would raise American's ticket\n\n\n                                -17-\n\ffare and, even if sustainable, would change the price for customers\n\nnot using curbside check-in.          In other words, the tips statute as\n\napplied in this case could easily affect price and not just the\n\nprovision of the service.\n\n            We do not endorse American's view that state regulation\n\nis preempted wherever it imposes costs on airlines and therefore\n\naffects fares because costs \"must be made up elsewhere, i.e., other\n\nprices raised or charges imposed.\"            This would effectively exempt\n\nairlines from state taxes, state lawsuits of many kinds, and\n\nperhaps most other state regulation of any consequence.               Our view\n\nthat the tips statute is preempted, in its application to the\n\npresent circumstances, rests instead on the reasoning and results\n\nin the three Supreme Court cases.\n\n            It    is   argued   to    us   that   American's   conduct     is   no\n\ndifferent than if the airline put out a jar labeled \"tips\" at the\n\nskycap counter and then appropriated the money dropped inside.\n\nAmerican, however, did not tell customers that they were paying $2\n\nper bag as a tip to skycaps; it said on posters identifying\n\nAmerican Airlines as the patron that this was a charge for curbside\n\nbaggage service, adding (when prompted) that a \"gratuity\" was not\n\nincluded.        Whether   or   not   some    passengers   ignored   the   sign,\n\nproperty theft was not involved.\n\n            Nor is the outcome altered by the jury's alternative\n\nbasis for the verdict--interference with advantageous relations.\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fTo stand alone, the interference tort would require evidence that\n\nAmerican's motives or means were improper because unrelated to any\n\nlegitimate corporate interest.    Blackstone v. Cashman, 860 N.E.2d\n\n7, 12-13 (Mass. 2007); Brewster Wallcovering Co. v. Blue Mtn.\n\nWallcoverings, Inc., 864 N.E.2d 518, 531-32, 541 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n2007).   Here, the jury instructions made plain that the improper\n\nmotive or means element--required to make out the tort claim--could\n\nproperly rest on the violation of the tips statute.\n\n          That the jury award on both claims did rest critically on\n\nthe tips statute is evident from the fact that the jury rejected\n\nthe tort claim of the sole plaintiff from Missouri, who was not\n\ncovered by the Massachusetts tips law and who could rest only on\n\nthe common law tort of interference with advantageous relations.\n\nAlthough American made this point on appeal, the skycaps' brief did\n\nnot point to any material difference in the Massachusetts and\n\nMissouri tort claims.   See also DiFiore, 688 F. Supp. 2d at 19.   On\n\nthis record, then, the jury concluded that the plaintiffs did not\n\nprove an independent common law interference claim.\n\n          The Massachusetts legislature, in amending the tips law\n\nto cover employees like skycaps, could have made a reasonable\n\nchoice to favor local workers even at some cost and multiplication\n\nof rules for national enterprises like American, operating in many\n\ndifferent states.   But this kind of state-determined trade-off may\n\nbe just what concerned Congress when it framed the preemption\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fprovision.   In all events, Morales, Wolens, and Rowe appear to us\n\nto dictate the outcome here.\n\n          The judgment of the district court granting recovery and\n\nawarding attorneys' fees is reversed and the case is remanded for\n\nentry of judgment in favor of American.   Each side shall bear its\n\nown costs on this appeal.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f",

(\"American\") began charging passengers a fee of $2 for each bag checked with porters who provide curbside service (called \"skycaps\") at Boston's Logan Airport. Arguing that passengers mistook the fee for a mandatory gratuity for the skycaps and stopped tipping, several porters brought suit against American; the present appeal is a product of that litigation. The facts and proceedings are as follows.</p>\n<p>Some passengers at Logan carry their own luggage into the airport and some have it brought inside to the counter by skycaps, but a great many check their luggage onto flights at curbside; ordinarily, the skycap will take the luggage from the curb, write up the baggage tags, and place the luggage on a conveyer belt destined for the airline cargo facilities. Prior to 2005, American made skycap services available to its customers free of charge beyond the plane farewith the airline <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> bearing the cost of skycap labor and other facilities involved in curbside check-in (conveyer belts, rent for space).</p>\n<p>American once itself employed skycaps to provide these services to passengers but now, at least in Boston, relies primarily on contractorsmost recently, a company called G2 Secure Staff, LLC (\"G2\"). Although all the American and G2 skycaps earned an hourly wage, their main source of income was tips. The customary gratuity at Logan Airport was about $1 per bag, and nearly all passengers tipped.</p>\n<p>In early 2005, one of American's competitors began charging a curbside check-in fee in Seattle. American tested the idea there before expanding the practice to other cities across the country. Separate charges for services that had once been bundled togetherfor example, for in-flight meals or extra bagswere becoming common in airline operations during this period. Due to deregulation, airline fares had fallen on many major routes, airlines were suffering low profits or losses, and separate charges were one of the responses.</p>\n<p>Like its competitors, American set the price for curbside check-in at $2 per bag, with an initial goal of merely offsetting the expense of providing skycap service. Revenues from the fee proved more than enough to recoup those costs, and American netted a substantial profit from the charge. In cities where American relied on contractors to provide skycap services, the airline and the contractor shared the proceeds from the new charge. At Logan, sixty percent went to the airline and forty percent to G2.</p>\n<p>As for the skycaps, American knew that the new fee would lessen tip income from passengers at least temporarily; in fact, some hourly salaries for the G2 skycaps at Logan airport were raised to comply with minimum wage laws in light of reduced tips. The skycaps were required to collect the $2 fee in cash to be turned over to the airline at the end of the business day; they were not supposed to solicit tips, although some apparently did; but they were free, if the customer inquired, to say that the fee was not a gratuity.</p>\n<p>When it instituted the fee at Logan in September 2005, American notified its customers of the new charge on its website as well as on three large, poster-size signs adjacent to the bag-check podiums outside the airport terminal. A typical sign, in its original format, read as follows:</p>\n                   Curbside\n                   Check-In\n             U.S. Domestic Flights\n                  $2 Per Bag\n               American Airlines\n<p>Within a week or two, skycaps had added notations to the official signs saying \"gratuity not included\" or words to this effect, and American then revised its standard posters to include this caveatplaced in considerably smaller lettering immediately below the fee itself. By October 14, 2005, American had ordered several hundred signs with this revised language for use across the country; the website, which referred only to the $2 per bag charge, was not altered. In Boston, four of the modified signs were posted at the skycap podiums and along the curbside.</p>\n<p>The skycaps' tip income fell significantly once the new charge began. Some passengers likely thought that $2 per bag was enough to pay and chose not to tip, but others interpreted the $2 fee as a mandatory tip to the skycap rather than a charge paid to the airline. Confusion persisted despite modification of the signs: the curbside can be hectic at busy times; there were other unrelated signs; and some luggage was collected far from the signage, down the line of parked cars and taxis.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> In December 2006, two skycaps at Logan, Don DiFiore and Leon Bailey, brought a putative class action against G2 and American in Massachusetts Superior Court, which the defendants removed to federal district court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. The claims against G2 were dismissed in light of an arbitration agreement, and class certification was denied. Eight more skycap plaintiffs joined the suit against American,<sup>[1]</sup> and the complaint was twice amended.</p>\n<p>By the time of the third amended complaintnow the operative pleadingthe claims against American were these: that American's curbside check-in fee violated a Massachusetts statute governing tips, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 152A (2008); that the airline's conduct created liability under state common law as tortious interference with advantageous relations, unlawful conversion, and unjust enrichment; and that the skycaps were entitled to restitution under principles of <i>quantum meruit.</i></p>\n<p>The tips law is the centerpiece of the appeal and its pertinent language provides that \"[n]o employer or other person shall demand ... or accept from any ... service employee ... any payment or deduction from a tip or service charge given to such... service employee ... by a patron.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 152A(b). The skycaps qualified as \"service employees\" for purposes of the statute. <i>Id.</i> § 152A(a). The term \"service charge\" is defined as</p>\n<blockquote>a fee charged by an employer to a patron in lieu of a tip to any ... service employee ... including any fee designated as a service charge, tip, gratuity, or a fee that a patron or other consumer would reasonably expect to be given to a... service employee ... in lieu of, or in addition to, a tip.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> The gravamen of the tips law claim is that the $2 fee is a \"service charge\" under state law (and must therefore go to the skycaps) because customers \"reasonably expect[ed]\" it to be given to the skycaps.</p>\n<p>American moved to dismiss the complaint, or alternatively for summary judgment, principally on the ground that the claims were barred by the express preemption clause of the Airline Deregulation Act: no state may \"enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier.\" 49 U.S.C. § 41713(b)(1) (2006). Judge Young denied the motion, <i>DiFiore v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,</i> 483 F.Supp.2d 121, 128 (D.Mass.2007), but later granted summary judgment to American on the <i>quantum meruit,</i> conversion, and unjust enrichment countstheories not pursued on appeal.</p>\n<p>The claim for recovery under the tips law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 152A(f), and the tortious-interference claim were both tried to a jury in March and April 2008. The jury awarded each Logan skycap plaintiff $2 per bag checked at curbside by that skycap from September 2005 to the start of trial, \"plus fees collected in March and April 2008\" during the trial. The St. Louis skycapnot covered by the Massachusetts tips law and bringing only a tortious-interference claim under Missouri lawwas awarded nothing and has not appealed.</p>\n<p>For those Logan skycaps who claimed both tortious interference and a violation of the tips statute, the jury awarded identical damages on both theories.<sup>[2]</sup> The district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> court construed state law as permitting the jury to award treble damages, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 149, § 150 (West 2004) (amended 2008); <i>Wiedmann v. Bradford Grp., Inc.,</i> 444 Mass. 698, 831 N.E.2d 304, 313 (2005), but the jury declined to award anything on this account.</p>\n<p>Thereafter the district court temporarily set aside the jury award but reinstated it after the state's highest court answered a certified questionnot germane to the disputed issues on this appealinvolving the interpretation of the tips statute. <i>DiFiore v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,</i> 454 Mass. 486, 910 N.E.2d 889, 891 (2009). Further post-trial motions led to another opinion rejecting the preemption claim, <i>DiFiore v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,</i> 688 F.Supp.2d 15, 23-24 (D.Mass.2009), and determining damages for the period of March and April 2008, <i>id.</i> at 25-26.</p>\n<p>A final amended judgment gave the nine prevailing skycaps $333,464 plus prejudgment interest; the court also awarded attorneys' fees and costs. American now appeals on multiple grounds; the successful skycap plaintiffs cross-appeal, arguing that the tips statute award should have been trebled. The central issue, federal preemption, is a question of statutory construction that we review <i>de novo. </i><i>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-Galarza,</i> 318 F.3d 323, 330 (1st Cir.2003). That it is a difficult one is confirmed by decisions conflicting with that of Judge Young by two other judges in the same district court.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The Airline Deregulation Act was enacted in 1978 as part of a wave of deregulatory measures adopted in the 1970s and 1980s. Prior airline regulation based on a public utility model had produced good service but at relatively high priceshigh, at least, compared to much lower fares that emerged under competition. To assure that the new regime was not trammeled by state re-regulation, the 1978 statute preempted state laws \"relating to rates, routes, or services.\" Pub.L. No. 95-504, § 4(a), 92 Stat. 1705, 1707-08 (1978) (codified at 49 U.S.C. app. § 1305(a)(1) (1982)); <i>see also </i><i>New Eng. Legal Found. v. Mass. Port Auth.,</i> 883 F.2d 157, 173 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n<p>When Congress later recodified Title 49, the 1978 preemption language was relocated in the same Title (to section 41713) and slightly rephrased to cover all state laws \"related to a price, route, or service,\" Pub.L. No. 103-272, § 1(e), 108 Stat. 745, 1143 (1994), but the changes were stylistic and \"not intend[ed] to impair the applicability of prior judicial case law interpreting these provisions,\" H.R.Rep. No. 103-677, at 83 (1994) (Conf. Rep.), <i>reprinted in</i> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1715, 1755. That Conference Report concerned a new statute carrying over the same preemption phrasing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> to apply it to motor carriers and certain air carriers functioning as motor carriers.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Case law is especially important in interpreting section 41713 because Congress' language in the preemption sectionalways the first resort in construing a federal statuteis broad but vague. A trio of Supreme Court cases have addressed and applied the statutory provision in question: <i>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> 504 U.S. 374, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992), <i>American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens,</i> 513 U.S. 219, 115 S.Ct. 817, 130 L.Ed.2d 715 (1995), and <i>Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transport Ass'n,</i> 552 U.S. 364, 128 S.Ct. 989, 169 L.Ed.2d 933 (2008). Although helpful in marking out results, none provides an easily applied test.</p>\n<p>The difficulty is that the key connector in the statute\"related to\"is highly elastic, <i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 383-84, 112 S.Ct. 2031, and so of limited help, given that countless state laws have <i>some</i> relation to the operations of airlines and thus <i>some</i> potential effect on the prices charged or services provided. Equally general is the gloss supplied by the cases of a \"`significant impact' related to Congress' deregulatory and pre-emption related objectives,\" rather than one merely \"tenuous, remote, or peripheral.\" <i>Rowe,</i> 552 U.S. at 371, 128 S.Ct. 989 (quoting <i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 390, 112 S.Ct. 2031).</p>\n<p>The statutory preemption language might have been read to target only state enactments focusing solely on airlines, but that reading has been twice rejected by the Supreme Court. <i>Wolens,</i> 513 U.S. at 227-28, 115 S.Ct. 817; <i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 386, 112 S.Ct. 2031. Similarly, preemption might have been confined to state laws that themselves aimed at <i>economic</i> regulation as opposed to other state interests,<sup>[5]</sup> but that course too has been foreclosed. <i>Rowe,</i> 552 U.S. at 373-76, 128 S.Ct. 989. So we are left to triangulate from the results in the leading Supreme Court decisions<i>Morales, Wolens,</i> and <i>Rowe</i>with some limited assistance from circuit court decisions.</p>\n<p>All three of the major Supreme Court cases endorsed preemption and read the preemption language broadly, <i>e.g., </i><i>Rowe,</i> 552 U.S. at 370-71, 128 S.Ct. 989; <i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 383-84, 112 S.Ct. 2031, and none adopted plaintiffs' position in this case that we should presume strongly against preempting in areas historically occupied by state law, <i>see e.g., </i><i>Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. v. Norris,</i> 512 U.S. 246, 252, 114 S.Ct. 2239, 129 L.Ed.2d 203 (1994). The state laws preempted in <i>Morales, Wolens,</i> and <i>Rowe</i> involved (respectively) deceptive advertising, alleged consumer abuse, and protection of healthareas historically regulated by states. However traditional the area, a state law may simultaneously interfere with an express federal policyhere, one limiting regulation of airlines.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> The state regimes at issue in <i>Morales</i> and <i>Wolens,</i> although based on generally applicable statutes, involved detailed guidelines crafted by state authorities directed against airlines; the statute in <i>Rowe</i> directly targeted carriers. But it is hard to imagine that Congress would have been happier if, absent detailed guidelines or a law targeting carriers, the states in <i>Morales, Wolens,</i> and <i>Rowe</i> simply let the jury condemn the same carrier conduct by applying broader statutory terms (<i>e.g.,</i> \"unfair\" competition or \"deceptive\" practices, <i>Wolens,</i> 513 U.S. at 227, 115 S.Ct. 817).</p>\n<p>However, there also exists a set of circuit cases declining to preempt state anti-discrimination<sup>[6]</sup> and retaliation laws,<sup>[7]</sup> as well as one case declining to preempt state prevailing wage laws, <i>Californians for Safe &amp; Competitive Dump Truck Transp. v. Mendonca,</i> 152 F.3d 1184, 1189 (9th Cir.1998), <i>cert. denied,</i> 526 U.S. 1060, 119 S.Ct. 1377, 143 L.Ed.2d 535 (1999). Negligence claims have been upheld against airlines for injuries occurring during airline operations themselves,<sup>[8]</sup> and the Ninth Circuit has even held possible a claim that might entail a rearrangement of cabin seating to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis, <i>Montalvo v. Spirit Airlines,</i> 508 F.3d 464, 474-75 (9th Cir.2007). <i>But see </i><i>Witty v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 366 F.3d 380, 383 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>These circuit cases confirm our view that the Supreme Court would be unlikelywith some possible qualificationsto free airlines from most conventional common law claims for tort, from prevailing wage laws, and ordinary taxes applicable to other businesses. Yet such measures must impact airline operationsand so, indirectly, may affect fares and services. And the tips law, like prevailing wage laws, is aimed at protecting employee compensation.</p>\n<p>The dividing line turns on the statutory language \"related to a price, route, or service.\" Importantly, the tips law does more than simply regulate the employment relationship between the skycaps and the airline; unlike the cited circuit cases, the tips law has a <i>direct connection</i> to air carrier prices and services and can fairly be said to regulate both. As to the latter, American's conduct in arranging for transportation of bags at curbside into the airline terminal en route to the loading facilities is itself a part of the \"service\" referred to in the federal statute, and the airline's \"price\" includes charges for such ancillary services as well as the flight itself.</p>\n<p>This view depends on reading \"price\" to include more than the ticket price and \"service\" to include steps that occur before <span class=\"star-pagination\">*88</span> and after the airplane is actually taxiing or in flight. On these issues the lower court decisions have not been uniform.<sup>[9]</sup> But this dispute has been superceded by controlling Supreme court case lawnamely, by <i>Rowe</i>'s expansive treatment of the term \"service.\" <i>Air Transp. Ass'n,</i> 520 F.3d at 223 (citing <i>Rowe,</i> 552 U.S. at 376, 128 S.Ct. 989). The weight of circuit court authority now favors the broader definition. <i>See id.</i> (collecting cases).</p>\n<p>Thus, the tips law as applied here directly regulates how an airline service is performed and how its price is displayed to customersnot merely how the airline behaves as an employer or proprietor. To avoid having state law deem the curbside check-in fee a \"service charge\" would require changes in the way the service is provided or advertised. Much of the trial below turned on the size of type stating the charge, the visibility of the posters, what customers could and would be told by the skycaps, and whether the airline should provide credit card machines that would more clearly distinguish the charge as a payment to the airline.</p>\n<p>Thus, in application, the Massachusetts tips statute, although mediated by a jury, has the same potential impact on American's practices as a guideline condemning the same conduct explicitly. If anything, the problem of diverse regimes is even greater than merely allowing fifty states to impose restrictions of their own. In Massachusetts, individual juries would effectively design their own detailed, ad hoc compliance schemes based on the size, location and wording of the signs posted by the airline.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has also said that federal preemption does not reach state laws that have only \"tenuous, remote, or peripheral\" impact. <i>Rowe,</i> 552 U.S. at 371, 128 S.Ct. 989 (quoting <i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 390, 112 S.Ct. 2031). The plaintiffs claim that the effect of the Massachusetts tips statute on prices and services is tenuous in this case, because the airline could comply with the state law without incurring great expense or substantially altering the gist of curbside check-in service. Their proposed remedies include:</p>\n<blockquote> Posting more signs in more prominent places</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Using larger font on the signs</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Modifying the American website to mention tips</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Permitting credit-card payments</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Installing a cash register at the curbside</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Re-bundling the cost of curbside check-in into ticket prices</blockquote>\n<p>This, to borrow an apt airplane image, is walking into a rotating propeller: the advertising and service arrangements are just what Congress did not want states regulating, whether at high cost or at low. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*89</span> When the Supreme Court invoked the rubric (\"tenuous, remote, or peripheral\"), it used as examples limitations on gambling, prostitution, or smoking in public places state regulation comparatively remote to the transportation function. <i>See </i><i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 390, 112 S.Ct. 2031; <i>Rowe,</i> 552 U.S. at 371, 375, 128 S.Ct. 989.</p>\n<p>Worse still, even if American took all of the steps listed (save the last), it could hardly be sure that it would be safe in imposing the $2 fee. A jury might still conclude that some passengers would believe the $2, approximating what passengers might expect to tip, was destined for the skycaps themselves. As for the last suggestion, that step would raise American's ticket fare and, even if sustainable, would change the price for customers not using curbside check-in. In other words, the tips statute as applied in this case could easily affect price and not just the provision of the service.</p>\n<p>We do not endorse American's view that state regulation is preempted wherever it imposes costs on airlines and therefore affects fares because costs \"must be made up elsewhere, <i>i.e.,</i> other prices raised or charges imposed.\" This would effectively exempt airlines from state taxes, state lawsuits of many kinds, and perhaps most other state regulation of any consequence. Our view that the tips statute is preempted, in its application to the present circumstances, rests instead on the reasoning and results in the three Supreme Court cases.</p>\n<p>It is argued to us that American's conduct is no different than if the airline put out a jar labeled \"tips\" at the skycap counter and then appropriated the money dropped inside. American, however, did not tell customers that they were paying $2 per bag as a tip to skycaps; it said on posters identifying American Airlines as the patron that this was a charge for curbside baggage service, adding (when prompted) that a \"gratuity\" was not included. Whether or not some passengers ignored the sign, property theft was not involved.</p>\n<p>Nor is the outcome altered by the jury's alternative basis for the verdictinterference with advantageous relations. To stand alone, the interference tort would require evidence that American's motives or means were improper because unrelated to any legitimate corporate interest. <i>Blackstone v. Cashman,</i> 448 Mass. 255, 860 N.E.2d 7, 12-13 (2007); <i>Brewster Wallcovering Co. v. Blue Mtn. Wallcoverings, Inc.,</i> 68 Mass.App.Ct. 582, 864 N.E.2d 518, 531-32, 541 (2007). Here, the jury instructions made plain that the improper motive or means elementrequired to make out the tort claimcould properly rest on the violation of the tips statute.</p>\n<p>That the jury award on both claims did rest critically on the tips statute is evident from the fact that the jury rejected the tort claim of the sole plaintiff from Missouri, who was not covered by the Massachusetts tips law and who could rest only on the common law tort of interference with advantageous relations. Although American made this point on appeal, the skycaps' brief did not point to any material difference in the Massachusetts and Missouri tort claims. <i>See also </i><i>DiFiore,</i> 688 F.Supp.2d at 19. On this record, then, the jury concluded that the plaintiffs did not prove an independent common law interference claim.</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts legislature, in amending the tips law to cover employees like skycaps, could have made a reasonable choice to favor local workers even at some cost and multiplication of rules for national enterprises like American, operating in many different states. But this kind of state-determined trade-off may be just what concerned Congress when it framed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> the preemption provision. In all events, <i>Morales, Wolens,</i> and <i>Rowe</i> appear to us to dictate the outcome here.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the district court granting recovery and awarding attorneys' fees is <i>reversed</i> and the case is <i>remanded</i> for entry of judgment in favor of American. Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Of the ten, one skycap was directly employed by American at Logan, seven skycaps were employed by G2 at Logan, one skycap had formerly been employed by G2 at Logan, and one skycap was employed by American in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>\n<p>[2]  The district court permitted only seven of the nine Logan skycaps to pursue both theories at trial. During discovery, two skycaps asserted their privilege against self-incrimination to withhold their tax records; those two skycaps were precluded from presenting evidence of damages that would have been required to make out a claim for tortious interference. The district court also made clear to the jury that no duplicative recovery would be permitted for skycaps who prevailed on both theories.</p>\n<p>[3]  <i>See </i><i>Brown v.

(\"American\") began charging passengers a fee of $2 for each bag checked with porters who provide curbside service (called \"skycaps\") at Boston's Logan Airport. Arguing that passengers mistook the fee for a mandatory gratuity for the skycaps and stopped tipping, several porters brought suit against American; the present appeal is a product of that litigation. The facts and proceedings are as follows.</p>\n<p>Some passengers at Logan carry their own luggage into the airport and some have it brought inside to the counter by skycaps, but a great many check their luggage onto flights at curbside; ordinarily, the skycap will take the luggage from the curb, write up the baggage tags, and place the luggage on a conveyer belt destined for the airline cargo facilities. Prior to 2005, American made skycap services available to its customers free of charge beyond the plane farewith the airline <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> bearing the cost of skycap labor and other facilities involved in curbside check-in (conveyer belts, rent for space).</p>\n<p>American once itself employed skycaps to provide these services to passengers but now, at least in Boston, relies primarily on contractorsmost recently, a company called G2 Secure Staff, LLC (\"G2\"). Although all the American and G2 skycaps earned an hourly wage, their main source of income was tips. The customary gratuity at Logan Airport was about $1 per bag, and nearly all passengers tipped.</p>\n<p>In early 2005, one of American's competitors began charging a curbside check-in fee in Seattle. American tested the idea there before expanding the practice to other cities across the country. Separate charges for services that had once been bundled togetherfor example, for in-flight meals or extra bagswere becoming common in airline operations during this period. Due to deregulation, airline fares had fallen on many major routes, airlines were suffering low profits or losses, and separate charges were one of the responses.</p>\n<p>Like its competitors, American set the price for curbside check-in at $2 per bag, with an initial goal of merely offsetting the expense of providing skycap service. Revenues from the fee proved more than enough to recoup those costs, and American netted a substantial profit from the charge. In cities where American relied on contractors to provide skycap services, the airline and the contractor shared the proceeds from the new charge. At Logan, sixty percent went to the airline and forty percent to G2.</p>\n<p>As for the skycaps, American knew that the new fee would lessen tip income from passengers at least temporarily; in fact, some hourly salaries for the G2 skycaps at Logan airport were raised to comply with minimum wage laws in light of reduced tips. The skycaps were required to collect the $2 fee in cash to be turned over to the airline at the end of the business day; they were not supposed to solicit tips, although some apparently did; but they were free, if the customer inquired, to say that the fee was not a gratuity.</p>\n<p>When it instituted the fee at Logan in September 2005, American notified its customers of the new charge on its website as well as on three large, poster-size signs adjacent to the bag-check podiums outside the airport terminal. A typical sign, in its original format, read as follows:</p>\n                   Curbside\n                   Check-In\n             U.S. Domestic Flights\n                  $2 Per Bag\n               American Airlines\n<p>Within a week or two, skycaps had added notations to the official signs saying \"gratuity not included\" or words to this effect, and American then revised its standard posters to include this caveatplaced in considerably smaller lettering immediately below the fee itself. By October 14, 2005, American had ordered several hundred signs with this revised language for use across the country; the website, which referred only to the $2 per bag charge, was not altered. In Boston, four of the modified signs were posted at the skycap podiums and along the curbside.</p>\n<p>The skycaps' tip income fell significantly once the new charge began. Some passengers likely thought that $2 per bag was enough to pay and chose not to tip, but others interpreted the $2 fee as a mandatory tip to the skycap rather than a charge paid to the airline. Confusion persisted despite modification of the signs: the curbside can be hectic at busy times; there were other unrelated signs; and some luggage was collected far from the signage, down the line of parked cars and taxis.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> In December 2006, two skycaps at Logan, Don DiFiore and Leon Bailey, brought a putative class action against G2 and American in Massachusetts Superior Court, which the defendants removed to federal district court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. The claims against G2 were dismissed in light of an arbitration agreement, and class certification was denied. Eight more skycap plaintiffs joined the suit against American,<sup>[1]</sup> and the complaint was twice amended.</p>\n<p>By the time of the third amended complaintnow the operative pleadingthe claims against American were these: that American's curbside check-in fee violated a Massachusetts statute governing tips, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 152A (2008); that the airline's conduct created liability under state common law as tortious interference with advantageous relations, unlawful conversion, and unjust enrichment; and that the skycaps were entitled to restitution under principles of <i>quantum meruit.</i></p>\n<p>The tips law is the centerpiece of the appeal and its pertinent language provides that \"[n]o employer or other person shall demand ... or accept from any ... service employee ... any payment or deduction from a tip or service charge given to such... service employee ... by a patron.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 152A(b). The skycaps qualified as \"service employees\" for purposes of the statute. <i>Id.</i> § 152A(a). The term \"service charge\" is defined as</p>\n<blockquote>a fee charged by an employer to a patron in lieu of a tip to any ... service employee ... including any fee designated as a service charge, tip, gratuity, or a fee that a patron or other consumer would reasonably expect to be given to a... service employee ... in lieu of, or in addition to, a tip.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> The gravamen of the tips law claim is that the $2 fee is a \"service charge\" under state law (and must therefore go to the skycaps) because customers \"reasonably expect[ed]\" it to be given to the skycaps.</p>\n<p>American moved to dismiss the complaint, or alternatively for summary judgment, principally on the ground that the claims were barred by the express preemption clause of the Airline Deregulation Act: no state may \"enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier.\" 49 U.S.C. § 41713(b)(1) (2006). Judge Young denied the motion, <i>DiFiore v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2334262\"><a href=\"/opinion/2334262/difiore-v-american-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, 128 (D.Mass.2007), but later granted summary judgment to American on the <i>quantum meruit,</i> conversion, and unjust enrichment countstheories not pursued on appeal.</p>\n<p>The claim for recovery under the tips law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 152A(f), and the tortious-interference claim were both tried to a jury in March and April 2008. The jury awarded each Logan skycap plaintiff $2 per bag checked at curbside by that skycap from September 2005 to the start of trial, \"plus fees collected in March and April 2008\" during the trial.

Prior airline regulation based on a public utility model had produced good service but at relatively high priceshigh, at least, compared to much lower fares that emerged under competition.

Although helpful in marking out results, none provides an easily applied test.</p>\n<p>The difficulty is that the key connector in the statute\"related to\"is highly elastic, <i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 383-84, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"><a href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Equally general is the gloss supplied by the cases of a \"`significant impact' related to Congress' deregulatory and pre-emption related objectives,\" rather than one merely \"tenuous, remote, or peripheral.\" <i>Rowe,</i> 552 U.S. at 371, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145829\"><a href=\"/opinion/145829/rowe-v-new-hampshire-motor-transport-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Similarly, preemption might have been confined to state laws that themselves aimed at <i>economic</i> regulation as opposed to other state interests,<sup>[5]</sup> but that course too has been foreclosed. <i>Rowe,</i> 552 U.S. at 373-76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145829\"><a href=\"/opinion/145829/rowe-v-new-hampshire-motor-transport-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>. So we are left to triangulate from the results in the leading Supreme Court decisions<i>Morales, Wolens,</i> and <i>Rowe</i>with some limited assistance from circuit court decisions.</p>\n<p>All three of the major Supreme Court cases endorsed preemption and read the preemption language broadly, <i>e.g., </i><i>Rowe,</i> 552 U.S. at 370-71, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145829\"><a href=\"/opinion/145829/rowe-v-new-hampshire-motor-transport-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2031</span></a></span>, and none adopted plaintiffs' position in this case that we should presume strongly against preempting in areas historically occupied by state law, <i>see e.g., </i><i>Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. v. Norris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117857\"><a href=\"/opinion/117857/hawaiian-airlines-inc-v-norris/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span>, 252, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117857\"><a href=\"/opinion/117857/hawaiian-airlines-inc-v-norris/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span> (1994). The state laws preempted in <i>Morales, Wolens,</i> and <i>Rowe</i> involved (respectively) deceptive advertising, alleged consumer abuse, and protection of healthareas historically regulated by states. However traditional the area, a state law may simultaneously interfere with an express federal policyhere, one limiting regulation of airlines.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> The state regimes at issue in <i>Morales</i> and <i>Wolens,</i> although based on generally applicable statutes, involved detailed guidelines crafted by state authorities directed against airlines; the statute in <i>Rowe</i> directly targeted carriers. But it is hard to imagine that Congress would have been happier if, absent detailed guidelines or a law targeting carriers, the states in <i>Morales, Wolens,</i> and <i>Rowe</i> simply let the jury condemn the same carrier conduct by applying broader statutory terms (<i>e.g.,</i> \"unfair\" competition or \"deceptive\" practices, <i>Wolens,</i> 513 U.S. at 227, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117890\"><a href=\"/opinion/117890/american-airlines-inc-v-wolens/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span>).</p>\n<p>However, there also exists a set of circuit cases declining to preempt state anti-discrimination<sup>[6]</sup> and retaliation laws,<sup>[7]</sup> as well as one case declining to preempt state prevailing wage laws, <i>Californians for Safe &amp; Competitive Dump Truck Transp. v. Mendonca,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757269\"><a href=\"/opinion/757269/californians-for-safe-and-competitive-dump-truck-transportation-lindeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1189 (9th Cir.1998), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></span> (1999). Negligence claims have been upheld against airlines for injuries occurring during airline operations themselves,<sup>[8]</sup> and the Ninth Circuit has even held possible a claim that might entail a rearrangement of cabin seating to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis, <i>Montalvo v. Spirit Airlines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1228434\"><a href=\"/opinion/1228434/montalvo-v-spirit-airlines/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span>, 474-75 (9th Cir.2007). <i>But see </i><i>Witty v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"34843\"><a href=\"/opinion/34843/witty-v-delta-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span>, 383 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>These circuit cases confirm our view that the Supreme Court would be unlikelywith some possible qualificationsto free airlines from most conventional common law claims for tort, from prevailing wage laws, and ordinary taxes applicable to other businesses. Yet such measures must impact airline operationsand so, indirectly, may affect fares and services. And the tips law, like prevailing wage laws, is aimed at protecting employee compensation.</p>\n<p>The dividing line turns on the statutory language \"related to a price, route, or service.\" Importantly, the tips law does more than simply regulate the employment relationship between the skycaps and the airline; unlike the cited circuit cases, the tips law has a <i>direct connection</i> to air carrier prices and services and can fairly be said to regulate both. As to the latter, American's conduct in arranging for transportation of bags at curbside into the airline terminal en route to the loading facilities is itself a part of the \"service\" referred to in the federal statute, and the airline's \"price\" includes charges for such ancillary services as well as the flight itself.</p>\n<p>This view depends on reading \"price\" to include more than the ticket price and \"service\" to include steps that occur before <span class=\"star-pagination\">*88</span> and after the airplane is actually taxiing or in flight. On these issues the lower court decisions have not been uniform.<sup>[9]</sup> But this dispute has been superceded by controlling Supreme court case lawnamely, by <i>Rowe</i>'s expansive treatment of the term \"service.\" <i>Air Transp. Ass'n,</i> 520 F.3d at 223 (citing <i>Rowe,</i> 552 U.S. at 376, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145829\"><a href=\"/opinion/145829/rowe-v-new-hampshire-motor-transport-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>). The weight of circuit court authority now favors the broader definition. <i>See id.</i> (collecting cases).</p>\n<p>Thus, the tips law as applied here directly regulates how an airline service is performed and how its price is displayed to customersnot merely how the airline behaves as an employer or proprietor. To avoid having state law deem the curbside check-in fee a \"service charge\" would require changes in the way the service is provided or advertised. Much of the trial below turned on the size of type stating the charge, the visibility of the posters, what customers could and would be told by the skycaps, and whether the airline should provide credit card machines that would more clearly distinguish the charge as a payment to the airline.</p>\n<p>Thus, in application, the Massachusetts tips statute, although mediated by a jury, has the same potential impact on American's practices as a guideline condemning the same conduct explicitly. If anything, the problem of diverse regimes is even greater than merely allowing fifty states to impose restrictions of their own. In Massachusetts, individual juries would effectively design their own detailed, ad hoc compliance schemes based on the size, location and wording of the signs posted by the airline.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has also said that federal preemption does not reach state laws that have only \"tenuous, remote, or peripheral\" impact. <i>Rowe,</i> 552 U.S. at 371, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145829\"><a href=\"/opinion/145829/rowe-v-new-hampshire-motor-transport-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2031</span></a></span>). The plaintiffs claim that the effect of the Massachusetts tips statute on prices and services is tenuous in this case, because the airline could comply with the state law without incurring great expense or substantially altering the gist of curbside check-in service. Their proposed remedies include:</p>\n<blockquote> Posting more signs in more prominent places</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Using larger font on the signs</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Modifying the American website to mention tips</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Permitting credit-card payments</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Installing a cash register at the curbside</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Re-bundling the cost of curbside check-in into ticket prices</blockquote>\n<p>This, to borrow an apt airplane image, is walking into a rotating propeller: the advertising and service arrangements are just what Congress did not want states regulating, whether at high cost or at low. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*89</span> When the Supreme Court invoked the rubric (\"tenuous, remote, or peripheral\"), it used as examples limitations on gambling, prostitution, or smoking in public places state regulation comparatively remote to the transportation function. <i>See </i><i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 390, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"><a href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Worse still, even if American took all of the steps listed (save the last), it could hardly be sure that it would be safe in imposing the $2 fee. A jury might still conclude that some passengers would believe the $2, approximating what passengers might expect to tip, was destined for the skycaps themselves. As for the last suggestion, that step would raise American's ticket fare and, even if sustainable, would change the price for customers not using curbside check-in. In other words, the tips statute as applied in this case could easily affect price and not just the provision of the service.</p>\n<p>We do not endorse American's view that state regulation is preempted wherever it imposes costs on airlines and therefore affects fares because costs \"must be made up elsewhere, <i>i.e.,</i> other prices raised or charges imposed.\" This would effectively exempt airlines from state taxes, state lawsuits of many kinds, and perhaps most other state regulation of any consequence. Our view that the tips statute is preempted, in its application to the present circumstances, rests instead on the reasoning and results in the three Supreme Court cases.</p>\n<p>It is argued to us that American's conduct is no different than if the airline put out a jar labeled \"tips\" at the skycap counter and then appropriated the money dropped inside. American, however, did not tell customers that they were paying $2 per bag as a tip to skycaps; it said on posters identifying American Airlines as the patron that this was a charge for curbside baggage service, adding (when prompted) that a \"gratuity\" was not included. Whether or not some passengers ignored the sign, property theft was not involved.</p>\n<p>Nor is the outcome altered by the jury's alternative basis for the verdictinterference with advantageous relations. To stand alone, the interference tort would require evidence that American's motives or means were improper because unrelated to any legitimate corporate interest. <i>Blackstone v. Cashman,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></span>, 12-13 (2007); <i>Brewster Wallcovering Co. v.

Here, the jury instructions made plain that the improper motive or means elementrequired to make out the tort claimcould properly rest on the violation of the tips statute.</p>\n<p>That the jury award on both claims did rest critically on the tips statute is evident from the fact that the jury rejected the tort claim of the sole plaintiff from Missouri, who was not covered by the Massachusetts tips law and who could rest only on the common law tort of interference with advantageous relations. Although American made this point on appeal, the skycaps' brief did not point to any material difference in the Massachusetts and Missouri tort claims. <i>See also </i><i>DiFiore,</i> 688 F.Supp.2d at 19. On this record, then, the jury concluded that the plaintiffs did not prove an independent common law interference claim.</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts legislature, in amending the tips law to cover employees like skycaps, could have made a reasonable choice to favor local workers even at some cost and multiplication of rules for national enterprises like American, operating in many different states. But this kind of state-determined trade-off may be just what concerned Congress when it framed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> the preemption provision. In all events, <i>Morales, Wolens,</i> and <i>Rowe</i> appear to us to dictate the outcome here.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the district court granting recovery and awarding attorneys' fees is <i>reversed</i> and the case is <i>remanded</i> for entry of judgment in favor of American.

During discovery, two skycaps asserted their privilege against self-incrimination to withhold their tax records; those two skycaps were precluded from presenting evidence of damages that would have been required to make out a claim for tortious interference. The district court also made clear to the jury that no duplicative recovery would be permitted for skycaps who prevailed on both theories.</p>\n<p>[3]  <i>See </i><i>Brown v.

Courts have construed the two statutes <i>in pari materia</i> and have cited precedents concerning either act interchangeably, <i>see </i><i>United Parcel Serv.,</i> 318 F.3d at 334-35 &amp; n. 17, as we do in this decision.</p>\n<p>[5]  Thus, the House Committee report on the 1978 statute said that the preemption clause was drafted to eliminate \"uncertainties and conflicts\" over federal and state rate-regulating authority, including situations in which carriers had been forced to charge different rates to passengers traveling between the same two cities, depending on whether those passengers' entire itineraries involved intrastate or interstate travel.
