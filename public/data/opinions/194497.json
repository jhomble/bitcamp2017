Appellee  Thomas Pugliese cross-\n\nappeals from the  district court  order disallowing  an award  of\n\nattorney  fees.  We affirm the district court judgment and remand\n\nfor reconsideration of the application for attorney fees.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          In  June  1986, Armand  Roberts  and Golden  Investment\n\nCorporation  loaned Pugliese  $75,000 with  which to  arrange his\n\nrelease  on  bail.   Pugliese  and  his  aunt,  Pauline Chroniak,\n\ncosigned  a promissory note which stated the dollar amount of the\n\ninterest charge  ($1,384.61 biweekly), but not  the interest rate\n                                                                 \n\nby percentage  (45% annually).  The  loan was secured  by a first\n             \n\nmortgage on the Chroniak residence.   The loan was repaid in full\n\nby June 1988.\n\n          In July  1987, appellants loaned Pugliese an additional\n\n$20,000 to buy equipment for his trucking business.  Pugliese and\n\nChroniak  executed a promissory  note in  the amount  of $27,000,\n\nwhich  required a  payment of  $7,000 within  ninety days  of its\n\nexecution.  \n\n                                3\n\nThe loan was  secured by a second mortgage  on the Chroniak home.\n\nIn  July  1988,  Pugliese  defaulted on  the  loan  after  making\n\nprincipal  payments totalling  $18,000.   Chroniak made  what she\n\nbelieved was a \"final\" $2,000 payment on the second mortgage loan\n\nshortly thereafter.  Claiming  that $27,000 (rather than $20,000)\n\nhad been advanced to  Pugliese under the second loan,  appellants\n\ndemanded   an  additional   $32,000  to   discharge   the  second\n\nmortgage.1   Pugliese's  counsel  notified  appellants that  both\n\nloans violated New Hampshire  law, as the notes did  not disclose\n\nthe percentage rate of  interest.  Appellants promptly instituted\n\nforeclosure proceedings on the Chroniak residence.\n\n          In  November 1988,  Pugliese  and Chroniak2  brought  a\n\nsix-count complaint against Roberts  and Golden Investment in New\n\nHampshire  federal district  court, alleging,  inter  alia,3 that\n                                                          \n\nthe interest  and repayment  provisions in both  promissory notes\n\nviolated three New Hampshire statutes.\n\n          Relying on the Second Mortgage Home Loan Act, N.H. Rev.\n\n                    \n\n     1Because Pugliese  made his  initial loan payment  after the\nspecified due  date, the note provided that interest would there-\nafter accumulate at  the rate of  $2,000 per month.   By  October\n1988, as a result of this rapid acceleration in interest accrual,\nappellants  made claim  to  an outstanding  principal balance  of\n$16,000, accrued interest of $15,000, and legal fees of $1,000.\n\n     2In December  1988, the foreclosure  proceedings against the\nChroniak  residence  were  suspended pending  resolution  of  the\npresent litigation.  In October 1991, Chroniak settled her  claim\nagainst appellants.\n\n     3The original complaint alleged violations of  the Racketeer\nInfluenced  and Corrupt  Organizations  statute.   See 18  U.S.C.\n                                                      \n  1962(c).   The RICO claims  were dismissed and  form no part of\nthe present appeal.\n\n                                4\n\nStat. Ann.   398-A [hereinafter:  \"SMHLA\"], the complaint alleged\n\nthat  (1)  appellants  had  forfeited  their  \"right  to  collect\n\ninterest\"  on  the  notes  by  failing  to  state  the  \"rate  of\n\ninterest,\"  thereby entitling  plaintiffs  to a  \"refund\" of  all\n\ninterest payments  on the $75,000 note  (i.e., $74,768.94) (SMHLA\n                                             \n\n  3),4  (2)  appellants' violations  of  SMHLA,  section 3,  con-\n\nstituted  criminal offenses  because they  were  \"willful\" (SMHLA\n                  \n\n  7a),  and (3) appellants overstated by $7,000 the amount of the\n\nloan  proceeds  received  by  Pugliese on  the  second  note,  or\n\nincluded  a $7,000 prepayment penalty in the second note (SMHLA  \n\n2 (III, IV)).\n\n          Relying on the Consumer Protection Act, N.H. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn.   358-A [hereinafter:  \"CPA\"], plaintiffs claimed (1) actual\n\ndamages because appellants' violations  of the SMHLA  constituted\n\n\"unfair or  deceptive act[s]  or [trade] practice[s]\"  (CPA   2),\n\nand (2) double or treble damages because appellants' violation of\n\nsection 2 of the CPA was \"willful or knowing\" (CPA   10). \n\n          Finally,  relying on  the  Unfair Collection  Practices\n\nAct, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   358-C [hereinafter:  \"UCPA\"],  plain-\n\ntiffs claimed that (1) appellants qualified both as \"debt collec-\n\ntors\" \n\n                    \n\n     4The complaint did not  demand reimbursement of the interest\npaid on the $27,000 note  but merely a declaration that the  note\nhad been  satisfied by plaintiffs' payments  totalling $20,000 in\nprincipal, an issue  which the jury resolved adversely  to appel-\nlants.\n\n                                5\n\n(UCPA   1)  and \"creditors\" engaged in  \"consumer credit transac-\n\ntions\"  in  the \"ordinary  course  of  business,\" (2)  appellants\n\nattempted  to  collect  interest  on  the  $75,000  note5 \"in  an\n\nunfair,  deceptive,  or  unreasonable  manner,\"  as the  interest\n\ncharges were  not \"expressly  authorized\" by the  loan agreement,\n\nhence were  not \"legally chargeable\" to the plaintiffs (UCPA    2\n\n&amp; 3), and  (3) appellants' violation  of the UCPA  simultaneously\n\nviolated CPA,  section 2,  which authorizes awards  of double  or\n\ntreble damages (UCPA   4(IV)).\n\n          Appellants initially were  granted summary judgment  on\n\nthe ground that the  SMHLA, whose violation formed the  bases for\n\nliability under  the CPA and  the UCPA, exempted  appellants from\n\nall  liability because  (1) Roberts  was not  licensed  under the\n\nSMHLA  to conduct  \"the business  of [providing]  second mortgage\n\nloans,\"  and (2)  both loans  were \"incidental\" to  Roberts' real\n\nestate  investment business.    On appeal,  these questions  were\n\ncertified to  the New  Hampshire Supreme Court,  which determined\n\nthat  the  SMHLA applies  both to  licensed  lenders and  to \"any\n                                                        \n\nperson making a loan secured by  a mortgage.\"  Chroniak v. Golden\n                                                                 \n\nInv.

Thereafter, the summary judgment was vacated on appeal\n\nand the case was remanded for trial.\n\n          In its final  charge to  the jury,  the district  court\n\nread  verbatim excerpts  from the  three New  Hampshire statutes.\n                       \n\nThe  jury ultimately  responded in  the following  manner to  the\n\nspecial verdict form and a special interrogatory:\n\n          1.   The loans extended by  Golden Investment\n               Corporation  to   Thomas  Pugliese  were\n               incidental to the  conduct or the opera-\n                         \n               tion   of   the   business   of   Golden\n               Investment Corporation.  (Question 1)\n\n          2.   Roberts  knew  that   the  $75,000   and\n               $27,000  notes  failed  to disclose  the\n               \"rate of interest.\"  (Questions 2, 3)\n\n          3.   The    $75,000    and    $27,000    loan\n               transactions were not \"strictly private\"\n               in nature  and  were undertaken  in  the\n               \"ordinary   course   of   a   trade   or\n               business.\"  (Questions 4,5)\n\n          4.   Pugliese  incurred  $20,000 in  damages.\n               (Question 6)\n\n          5.   Pugliese  received  only $20,000  in the\n               course of the loan transaction evidenced\n               by  the  $27,000 promissory  note signed\n               July 27, 1987.  (Special Interrogatory)\n\nOn  October 24, 1991,  the  district court  entered judgment  for\n\nPugliese in  the amount of $20,000,  rejecting Pugliese's request\n\nfor an award of attorney fees.\n\n                                7\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nA.

Appellants concede  that the\n     \n\nverdicts may have been based  on their failure to state the  rate\n\nof  interest  in  the   promissory  notes,  which  constituted  a\n\npredicate violation of  both the CPA and the UCPA.   On the other\n\nhand, appellants argue  that the  jury simply  may have  bypassed\n\nconsideration  of the CPA and the UCPA altogether, instead basing\n\nits award  solely on appellants' direct  \"technical\" violation of\n                 \n\nthe disclosure requirements in SMHLA, section 3:\n\n                    \n\n     6Although it is undisputed that the jury found that Pugliese\nsustained  monetary  damages  as  a  consequence  of  appellants'\n\"knowing\" failure to disclose the rate of interest in the promis-\nsory  notes,  three  factors  hamper our  review  of  appellants'\nvarious challenges to the jury instructions.  First, the district\ncourt  read  verbatim  excerpts  from  the  three  New  Hampshire\n                               \nstatutes, but  during its  deliberations the jury  apparently was\nprovided with unexcerpted photocopies  of the statutes, including\n                         \nextraneous, uninstructed  portions.   Second,  the jury  received\nlittle guidance as to  whether (or how) the three  statutes might\nbe  interrelated.   Finally,  the special  verdict  form did  not\nrequire the jury to indicate the statutory provision on which its\naward was based.   Consequently, we must scrutinize the statutes,\nthe jury charge, and the special verdict form to  ensure that the\njury  verdicts were  not predicated  on any  impermissible basis,\nincluding an  incorrect application of the statutory  law.

Pugliese\n\nopposed  summary   judgment  on   the  ground  that   a  criminal\n                                                                 \n\n(\"willful\") violation of SMHLA,  section 3, would give rise  to a\n\ncommon-law cause of  action for restitution of  the interest paid\n\non  the illegal  loan.    Prior  to  trial,  the  district  court\n\npurportedly  granted appellants'  motion to  dismiss the  \"common\n\n                    \n\n     7We reject appellants' contention that the complaint did not\nallege that  SMHLA,   3, created  an independent cause  of action\nfor rescission of the  loan agreement and refund of  the interest\npayments.   Count one alleged that the $75,000 note was \"illegal\"\nand  \"[p]laintiffs are  entitled  to have  all interest  payments\nrefunded. . . .\"\n\n                                9\n\nlaw\" claims based on SMHLA, section 3.  Thus, the  jury was given\n\nno instruction on any \"common law\" claims based on SMHLA, section\n\n3.\n\n          Normally, this  would end  our inquiry.   As previously\n\nsuggested, however,  two factors  aligned to configure  a correct\n\njury  instruction  on  the applicable  law.    In  the course  of\n\ndefining  the predicate conduct that could serve as an \"unfair or\n\ndeceptive\"  trade practice under the CPA and the UCPA, sections 2\n\nand 3  of the SMHLA  were read, verbatim, to  the jury.   But the\n                                        \n\ncourt  did not  instruct the  jury  that it  could  not return  a\n                                                                 \n\nverdict based exclusively on the  provisions of SMHLA, section 3.\n                                                                \n\nMoreover, the court later  denied Pugliese's request for attorney\n\nfees because it could  not discern whether the jury  had premised\n\nits verdict exclusively on SMHLA, section 3, the  only one of the\n                       \n\nthree statutes presented to the jury which does not authorize fee\n\nshifting.  See infra pt. II.B.\n                    \n\n          We  agree   with  the  district  court   that  no  mere\n\n\"technical\" violation of SMHLA,  section 3, could give rise  to a\n\ncommon-law cause  of action  for restitution.8   Nevertheless, we\n          \n\nconclude  that  the  SMHLA,  holistically  construed,  creates  a\n\n                    \n\n     8Pugliese  based this  implied  private cause  of action  on\n                                   \nKaramanou v. H.V.  Greene Co., 80 N.H. 420, 423,  124 A. 373, 375\n                             \n(1922), which held  that a  person who sustains  damages under  a\nprohibited contractual provision  may, \"after the  transaction is\nfinished and completed [,] . .  bring [an] action and defeat  the\ncontract.\"   (Citation omitted).   In Karamanou and  its progeny,\n                                               \nhowever, the defendants committed criminal violations of statutes\n                                          \ndesigned to  protect the plaintiffs.   Pugliese  pursued no  such\nallegation,  nor did he make  it the subject  of a special inter-\nrogatory.  See infra note 17.\n                    \n\n                                10\n\nstatutory cause of action for so-called \"technical\" violations of\n         \n\nsection 3.   First,  a jury  determination that  Roberts violated\n\nSMHLA,  section  3,   necessarily  would  entail  a   concomitant\n\nviolation  of SMHLA,  section 2  (also read  to the  jury), which\n\nstates in pertinent part:\n\n          The  allowable rate  of interest  computed on\n                                                    \n          the  unpaid  balance  that  any   person  may\n          directly  or  indirectly   charge,  take   or\n                                                       \n          receive for a second mortgage loan secured by\n                 \n          property which  is occupied in whole  or part\n          at  the time said loan  is made as  a home by\n          any obligor  on the  mortgage debt or  by any\n          person  granting  or  releasing any  interest\n          under said mortgage shall be  the rate agreed\n                                                       \n          upon  in the  note between  the  borrower and\n                            \n          lender, and following the sixth month  of any\n          period in which a loan has been in continuous\n          default not more than 1-1/2 percent per month\n          [18% annual] on any unpaid balances.\n\n(Emphasis added.)  The synergism between  sections 2 and 3 of the\n\nSMHLA  derives from  their  shared  use  of  the  term  \"rate  of\n\ninterest.\"  Under section 2, a lender may not compute (hence, may\n\nnot receive) interest at a \"rate\" not  \"agreed upon in the note.\"\n           \n\nThus, a covered lender's  receipt of interest charges based  on a\n\nnote which discloses no rate of interest violates both sections 2\n                                                      \n\nand 3.   Furthermore,  SMHLA, section  7,  provides in  pertinent\n\npart:\n\n          Any loan made in violation of  [section] 398-\n                                                       \n          A:2 by  any person  shall be  discharged upon\n             \n          payment or tender by the debtor or any person\n          succeeding  to  his  interest  in  such  real\n          estate   of   the   principal  sum   actually\n          borrowed.    The  superior court  shall  have\n          jurisdiction  of all suits  arising under RSA\n                                                       \n          398-A:2 and  if a  finding is made  that such\n                 \n          loan  secured by  any such  mortgage violates\n          said section such borrower shall  be entitled\n                                    \n          as part of  his costs to a reasonable fee for\n                                                       \n\n                                11\n\n          the services of his attorney in such suit.\n                                      \n\n(Emphasis added.)  Accordingly,  as the New Hampshire Legislature\n\ninarguably afforded  borrowers a right of  action for restitution\n\nof  the interest paid in  excess of the  interest \"agreed upon in\n\nthe note,\"9 SMHLA,   2, even  a jury verdict based exclusively on\n\na so-called  \"technical\" failure to disclose the rate of interest\n\nwould comport with the applicable New Hampshire law as instructed\n\nby the district court.10\n\n     2.  \"Unfair or Deceptive Act or \n          Practice\" Under CPA, Section 2\n                                        \n\n          Appellants contend  that  it was  reversible  error  to\n\ninstruct the jury that the mere omission of the rate of  interest\n\n                    \n\n     9We  ascribe  no  controlling  significance  to  the  jury's\nfailure to award Pugliese  the entire amount of interest  paid on\nthe $75,000 note.   A lender who commits a  \"technical\" violation\nof a  credit disclosure statute  may be entitled  to set off  the\nreasonable  value of  the goods  or money  advanced while  in the\npossession of the buyer  or borrower.  See, e.g.,  General Motors\n                                                                 \nAcceptance Corp. v. Kyle, 351 P.2d 768, 774 (Cal. 1960).\n                        \n\n     10Appellants argue that a \"technical\" violation of a lending\ndisclosure statute  should not invariably result  in the voidance\nof a  loan contract  or in  the borrower's  right to recover  the\ninterest  paid  on  the   note.    Cf.  DeCato  Bros.,   Inc.  v.\n                                                             \nWestinghouse Credit  Corp., 129  N.H. 504,  529  A.2d 952  (1987)\n                          \n(analogous case under   399-B);  First Fed.

In DeCato, for\n                                                            \nexample,  the court  addressed  the limited  question \"whether  a\nconsequence  [i.e.,  restitution  of  an  undisclosed  prepayment\n                  \nremedy] beyond the one prescribed by the statute [i.e.,  criminal\n                                                      \npenalties  for the  lender]  should attach  [to the  violation].\"\nDeCato,  129 N.H. at 509,  529 A.2d at 955.   These cases form no\n      \nbasis for the  proposition that  a \"technical\"  violation of  the\nSMHLA could  not support a  jury verdict depriving  appellants of\nthe  benefit of their bargain (i.e., the undisclosed interest), a\n                                   \nremedy explicitly authorized in SMHLA,   7.\n\n                                12\n\nfrom  the notes would constitute  an \"unfair or  deceptive act or\n\npractice  in the  conduct of  any trade  or business\"  within the\n\nmeaning of CPA, section 2, which provides, in pertinent part:\n\n          It shall  be unlawful  for any person  to use\n          any  unfair  method  of  competition  or  any\n          unfair or  deceptive act or  practice in  the\n                                               \n          conduct of any trade  or commerce within this\n                                           \n          state.   Such unfair method of competition or\n          unfair or  deceptive  act or  practice  shall\n          include, but is not limited to, the following\n          [list of thirteen acts] . . . .\n\n(Emphasis  added.)  Appellants argue that:  (1) the New Hampshire\n\nLegislature   has  amended  several   other  consumer  protection\n\nstatutes so as to  make their violation a simultaneous  violation\n\nof  the CPA, section 2,  while prior SMHLA  amendments contain no\n\nsimilar cross-referencing provision, and (2) the evidence adduced\n\nat trial was insufficient to entitle Pugliese to such an instruc-\n\ntion, since the jury  reasonably could not have inferred  that he\n\nwas  treated  unfairly  or  otherwise  deceived  by   appellants'\n\nomissions.  \n\n          The current version of  section 2 lists thirteen unfair\n\nor deceptive acts or practices, but the listing is expressly made\n\nnon-exhaustive.    Although  the   statute  provides  no  further\n\nexplication  and  New Hampshire  caselaw is  sparse, consultation\n\nwith both federal and Massachusetts precedent is encouraged.11\n\n                    \n\n     11The CPA itself provides that  courts should \"be guided  by\nthe interpretation and construction  given Section 5(a)(1) of the\nFederal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)), by the Federal\nTrade Commission and the  federal courts.\"  N.H.

In\n\n1981, when  New Hampshire  largely deregulated the  mortgage loan\n\nindustry  and  eliminated  the  usury laws  applicable  to  these\n\ntransactions,  see, e.g.,  N.H. Rev.  Stat.   218.1,  these \"full\n                        \n\ndisclosure\"  statutes took on  increased significance as consumer\n\nprotection provisions.  Although  disclosure of the dollar amount\n\nof interest charged would  no doubt put many borrowers  on notice\n\nof  the rate of  interest, the statute  presumes that  it will be\n\ndifficult for  the average  borrower to calculate  the percentage\n\nrate from the dollar figures; accordingly, the statute places the\n\nburden on the lender to express the rate of interest.  Cf. DeCato\n                                                                 \n\nBros., 129 N.H.  at 508-09, 529 A.2d at 954  (fact that \"the rate\n     \n\nof  interest  . . .  could   be  readily  ascertained  by  simple\n\ncomparison of the principal amount  financed with the face amount\n\nof  the notes  . . .  does not  vitiate noncompliance\"  with non-\n\ndisclosure statute);  American Improvement  v.

Indeed,  SMHLA, section  3, was  amended in  1967, even\n\nbefore   deregulation,  specifically  to   eliminate  the  option\n\npreviously  allowed the  lender  to express  the interest  charge\n\neither by percentage, \"or by its equivalent in money.\"  N.H. Rev.\n\nStat.   258:5.13\n\n          We  conclude that  the appellants' failure  to disclose\n\nthe percentage interest rate as required  under SMHLA, section 3,\n\nwas  sufficient to form a predicate \"unfair or deceptive practice\n\nor act\" under CPA, section 2, and that the plaintiff was entitled\n\nto such an instruction.14\n\n     3.  \"Willfulness\" Instruction\n                                  \n\n          Appellants argue that the district  court misinstructed\n\n                    \n\n     13Interestingly,  several  witnesses  made widely  divergent\ncalculations  of the percentage  rate appellants charged Pugliese\n    ranging from  36% to  52%.

In  Welch, the court\n                                                      \nfound  no  evidence that  the  defendants  \"acted in  bad  faith,\ndishonestly, or in any way attempted to take unfair advantage . .\n.\"  Id.  at 362, 430 A.2d  at 147 (\"We fail  to see how the  good\n       \nfaith attempts of the  defendants to comply with  the terms of  a\nstandard warranty  can be  classified as  an unfair  or deceptive\npractice.\")  In Welch, however, the  defendants complied with the\n                     \nliteral  requirements of  their  warranty; in  this  case, it  is\nundisputed  that appellants did not comply with the interest rate\ndisclosure requirements of SMHLA,    2 &amp; 3.\n\n                                17\n\nthe jury  that appellants' conduct could  be determined \"willful\"\n\nif appellants knew that  the rate of interest  was not stated  in\n\nthe notes.   Since the  complaint alleged a  violation of  SMHLA,\n\nsection  3, and a \"willful\"  violation of section  3 would expose\n\nappellants to criminal penalties, see N.H. Rev. Stat.

Thus,  the court's extraneous  instruction defining\n\n\"willfulness\"15  ultimately  imposed  a more  stringent  mens rea\n                                                                 \n\nrequirement than  required by the  statutory language.

Thus, in the event the jury considered whether\nappellants' conduct constituted a criminal violation of the SMHLA\n(as opposed  to a non-willful \"technical\"  violation), the quoted\ninstruction insulated the jury charge from  appellants' challenge\n   that a finding of specific intent was required.

The  SMHLA provides  but two  remedies for  violations of\n\nSMHLA, section  3.   If a  lender knowingly16  omits the  rate of\n\ninterest  from a promissory note    willfully or otherwise    the\n\nborrower may  maintain a  private  cause of  action under  SMHLA,\n\nsections 2, 3  and 7,  to recover  any interest  received by  the\n\nlender in excess of the interest rate \"agreed upon in the  note.\"\n\nSee supra pt. II.A.1.   If the section 3 violation was \"willful,\"\n         \n\nhowever,  the lender is  subject to  criminal penalties  as well.\n\nSMHLA, section 7a, provides:\n\n          Any   person   who   wilfully  violates   any\n                                                 \n          provision  of this  chapter [SMHLA]  shall be\n          guilty of a misdemeanor if  a natural person,\n          or guilty  of a  felony if any  other person,\n          for each such violation.\n\n(Emphasis added.)  \n\n          The special  verdict form reflects a  jury finding that\n\nappellants \"knowingly\"  failed to disclose the  rate of interest.\n\nSince the  \"willfulness\" element (i.e., appellants'  knowledge or\n                                      \n\ndisregard of the statutory requirement that the  rate of interest\n\n                    \n\n     16As the notes were prepared  by Roberts' attorney, the jury\nwas  asked  to  determine whether  Roberts  had  notice that  the\npercentage  rates of  interest  were omitted,  and whether  these\nomissions had the capacity to deceive, within the meaning of CPA,\n  2.\n\n                                19\n\nbe stated in  the note) would be relevant  only to the imposition\n\nof a criminal penalty  under section 7a (section 7a  never having\n\nbeen read to the jury),  the failure to give a \"specific  intent\"\n\ninstruction was  \"harmless\" error  at most;17  at best, the  jury\n\ninstruction  amounted to beneficial  error, as  it placed  on the\n\nplaintiff a more difficult burden of proof.  \n\n          The  only other  statute  to which  a determination  of\n\n\"willfulness\"  would have been relevant is CPA, section 10, which\n\nprovides  that \"[i]f the [factfinder]  finds that the  use of the\n\nmethod of competition  or the act or  practice was a  willful and\n                                                                 \n\nknowing violation of  this chapter, it shall  award as much as  3\n       \n\ntimes,  but not  less  than 2  times,  such amount.\"    (Emphasis\n\nadded.)  Like SMHLA, section 7a, this portion of CPA, section 10,\n\nwas never read to the  jury.18  The special verdict form  did not\n\nrequest a finding as  to whether plaintiff's \"damages\" should  be\n\ndoubled or trebled, and the district court did not in fact double\n\nor  treble the award.  Any error in the \"willfulness\" instruction\n\nwas therefore harmless.\n\n     4.  \"Incidental\" Exemption Instruction\n                                           \n\n          SMHLA,   section  10(II),  exempts  from  its  coverage\n\n\"individuals  or corporations who  make mortgage loans incidental\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     17In closing argument, plaintiff's counsel never referred to\na \"criminal\" violation of the SMHLA.  Moreover, the jury instruc-\ntion  simply referred  to  a \"violation\"  of  SMHLA,   3,  not  a\n\"criminal violation.\"\n\n     18Prior to  the jury charge,  plaintiff's counsel disclaimed\ndouble or treble damages.\n\n                                20\n\nto the conduct or the operation of another business, such as real\n                                                                 \n\nestate  or  construction.\"    (Emphasis added.)    The  jury  was\n                        \n\ninstructed to determine:  (1) whether \"the principal  activity of\n\nGolden Investment Corporation\" was real estate investment and (2)\n\nif so, whether these  loans were \"incidental\" to its  real estate\n\ninvestment  business.    The  district  court  defined  the  term\n\n\"incidental\" to encompass a matter which \"inseparably depends on,\n\npertains  to, and is subordinate to the main or principal project\n\n[of the business].\"\n\n          Appellants argue that  the court improperly required  a\n\nthreshold determination  that  the principal  activity of  Golden\n\nInvestment was  real estate investment,  thereby disenfranchising\n\nits  defense if the jury found that general investment was Golden\n                                           \n\nInvestment's principal business activity.  We disagree.  \n\n          Section 10 itself restricts  the exemption to a limited\n\ncategory  of businesses;  namely, those  already engaged  in real\n                                                                 \n\nestate-related activities \"such  as\" real estate construction  or\n      \n\ninvestment.   In real  estate-related activities, there  exists a\n\ngreater business  need to afford mortgage loan  financing to cus-\n\ntomers  as an  ancillary commercial  service.   Cf. Moore  v. New\n                                                                 \n\nHampshire Ins.

The necessary nexus was not\n\n                                21\n\nlost  on the district court; its instruction required the jury to\n\nconsider  whether the  loans \"inseparably  depend[ed]\" on  appel-\n\nlants' main business activity.19\n\n          Appellants  claim that  the jury  should have  been in-\n\nstructed that  \"incidental\" means \"occurring merely  by chance or\n\nwithout intention or calculation,  or being likely to inure  as a\n\nminor  consequence.\"     To  the  extent   appellants  suggest  a\n\ndefinition  based on mere  fortuity, it clearly  does not comport\n\nwith the statutory context, or the legislative intent, underlying\n\nthe section  10 exemption.20    Moreover, we  see no  significant\n\ndifference between the language  utilized in the jury instruction\n\n(\"subordinate  to the main or principal  project\") and the second\n\nelement in  the definition proposed by  appellants (\"minor conse-\n\nquence\"), as  both  require the  jury  to determine  whether  the\n\nsecond  mortgage lending  activity on  which Pugliese's  cause of\n\naction  is predicated  constituted a  relatively minor  aspect of\n                                                \n\nappellants' overall  business activity.  We  find further support\n\nfor our  interpretation of the  term \"incidental\" in  the opinion\n\npreviously rendered by  the New Hampshire  Supreme Court in  this\n\ncase:\n\n                    \n\n     19We note further that appellants did not produce sufficient\nevidence to  support their contention that  Golden Investment was\nformed to engage in  general investment.  The two  mortgage loans\nto  Pugliese  were the  only  significant  business conducted  by\n                            \nappellants during the entire time period at issue in the case.\n\n     20The  first  element  in  the  proposed   definition  seems\nespecially  discordant  in  the  present context,  as  few  loans\ntotalling  $95,000 could ever be found to have been made \"without\nintention or calculation.\"\n\n                                22\n\n          [L]oans  made  by  a  corporation  formed  to\n          engage in  real estate investment  are exempt\n                                           \n          from  the requirements of  RSA chapter 398-A,\n          assuming they are \"incidental\" to the conduct\n          of that business.  . . . [W]e  do not  ignore\n          the  improbability that  a loan  advanced for\n          purposes of posting bail or purchasing a boat\n          trailer could ever  be considered  incidental\n          to the  business of a  corporation formed  to\n          engage in real estate investment.\n                                          \n\nChroniak v.

The evidence not only showed that\n\nthese  loans were not a  subordinate or minor  activity of Golden\n\nInvestment,  the evidence disclosed that Golden Investment's only\n                                                                 \n\nsignificant income-generating activity during the entire relevant\n\nperiod derived from these two loans to Pugliese.\n\n          We conclude that the jury instruction on SMHLA, section\n\n10, did not constitute reversible error.21\n\n                    \n\n     21Appellants raise four other unsuccessful claims on appeal,\nbased   generally  on   their   characterization  of   the   jury\ninstructions  as  \"confusing.\"     First,  appellants  failed  to\npreserve their claim that the jury may  have been misled when the\ndistrict court read CPA,   10, out of sequence (i.e., between its\n                                                    \nreading of SMHLA,   3, and SMHLA,   10).  When asked by the court\nwhether the  provision of  photocopies of  these statutes  to the\njury in  the correct  sequential order would  satisfy appellants'\nobjections, defense counsel responded in the affirmative.\n          Second,  appellants  maintain  that the  statutes  were\ninherently confusing, and  should not have been  read verbatim to\nthe  jury.  We do  not conclude that  the statutes are inherently\nconfusing;  moreover, even  such a  conclusion would  not benefit\nappellants since the jury was guided by the special verdict form,\nwhich described  the essential findings required  under the three\nstatutes.  See supra p. 7.  \n                    \n          Third,  appellants argue  that  the  court should  have\ndefined  the  statutory term  \"ordinary  course  of business,\"  a\nrelevant  term under  both the  CPA and  the UCPA.

Carson, 374  Mass. 606, 610,  373 N.E.2d 973\n                           \n\n                                23\n\nB.  The Pugliese Cross-appeal\n                             \n\n          Pugliese claims  he was  entitled  to recover  attorney\n\nfees  because the jury  must have based  its award on  one of the\n\nthree  fee shifting statutes (SMHLA,     2 &amp; 7;  CPA,   10; UCPA,\n\n  4).22    The  district  court  denied  an  attorney  fee  award\n\nbecause  it  could not  exclude  the  possibility that  the  jury\n\nverdict was based on  a violation of SMHLA, section 3, which does\n\nnot authorize attorney fees.  As we have determined that a viola-\n\ntion of SMHLA, section 3, would necessarily entail a violation of\n\nSMHLA, section 2,  see supra pt. II.A.1, we are  able to conclude\n                            \n\nthat the jury verdict was based on a fee shifting statute, either\n\nSMHLA,    2 &amp; 7, CPA,    2 &amp; 10, or UCPA,    2 &amp; 4.  Accordingly,\n\nwe  remand  for reconsideration  of the  motion  for an  award of\n\nattorney fees.\n\n                    \n\n(1978)).  UCPA,   1, likewise provides in pertinent part:\n\n     IV.   \"Creditor\"  means a  person who  in  the ordinary\n                                                            \n     course   of  business   engages   in  consumer   credit\n                          \n     transactions with consumers.\n\n(Emphasis added.)  We do not believe the term \"ordinary course of\nbusiness\" was  used in any  technical sense, or  required further\nexplanation by the  court.  The  special verdict form  adequately\nformulated  the  essential   distinction  raised  by  appellants'\ndefense      whether  appellants  were engaged  in  a  \"business\"\nactivity when they loaned these funds to Pugliese, or whether the\nloans were between \"private\" individuals.\n     Finally, appellants  incorrectly  assert that  the  district\ncourt  did  not  read  the  statutory  definition  of  \"creditor\"\nappearing in UCPA,   1(IV).  See Tr. at 771-72.\n                                \n\n     22Pugliese theorized that the jury must  have found that the\n$27,000 note  contained a  $7,000 prepayment penalty,  which con-\nstituted an independent violation of SMHLA,   2.  See supra p. 3.\n                                                           \nWe need not address this issue.\n\n                                24\n\n          The district  court judgment is affirmed  on the merits\n                                                                 \n\nand the case is remanded for reconsideration of the motion for an\n                                                                 \n\naward of attorney fees.\n                      \n\n                                25\n",

Appellants  Armand  Roberts and\n          Cyr,  Circuit  Judge.\n                              \n\nGolden  Investment Corporation  challenge  the  district  court's\n\ninterpretation of three New Hampshire statutes regulating lending\n\nand debt  collection practices.  Appellee  Thomas Pugliese cross-\n\nappeals from the  district court  order disallowing  an award  of\n\nattorney  fees.  We affirm the district court judgment and remand\n\nfor reconsideration of the application for attorney fees.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          In  June  1986, Armand  Roberts  and Golden  Investment\n\nCorporation  loaned Pugliese  $75,000 with  which to  arrange his\n\nrelease  on  bail.   Pugliese  and  his  aunt,  Pauline Chroniak,\n\ncosigned  a promissory note which stated the dollar amount of the\n\ninterest charge  ($1,384.61 biweekly), but not  the interest rate\n                                                                 \n\nby percentage  (45% annually).  The  loan was secured  by a first\n             \n\nmortgage on the Chroniak residence.   The loan was repaid in full\n\nby June 1988.\n\n          In July  1987, appellants loaned Pugliese an additional\n\n$20,000 to buy equipment for his trucking business.  Pugliese and\n\nChroniak  executed a promissory  note in  the amount  of $27,000,\n\nwhich  required a  payment of  $7,000 within  ninety days  of its\n\nexecution.  \n\n                                3\n\nThe loan was  secured by a second mortgage  on the Chroniak home.\n\nIn  July  1988,  Pugliese  defaulted on  the  loan  after  making\n\nprincipal  payments totalling  $18,000.   Chroniak made  what she\n\nbelieved was a \"final\" $2,000 payment on the second mortgage loan\n\nshortly thereafter.  Claiming  that $27,000 (rather than $20,000)\n\nhad been advanced to  Pugliese under the second loan,  appellants\n\ndemanded   an  additional   $32,000  to   discharge   the  second\n\nmortgage.1   Pugliese's  counsel  notified  appellants that  both\n\nloans violated New Hampshire  law, as the notes did  not disclose\n\nthe percentage rate of  interest.  Appellants promptly instituted\n\nforeclosure proceedings on the Chroniak residence.\n\n          In  November 1988,  Pugliese  and Chroniak2  brought  a\n\nsix-count complaint against Roberts  and Golden Investment in New\n\nHampshire  federal district  court, alleging,  inter  alia,3 that\n                                                          \n\nthe interest  and repayment  provisions in both  promissory notes\n\nviolated three New Hampshire statutes.\n\n          Relying on the Second Mortgage Home Loan Act, N.H. Rev.\n\n                    \n\n     1Because Pugliese  made his  initial loan payment  after the\nspecified due  date, the note provided that interest would there-\nafter accumulate at  the rate of  $2,000 per month.   By  October\n1988, as a result of this rapid acceleration in interest accrual,\nappellants  made claim  to  an outstanding  principal balance  of\n$16,000, accrued interest of $15,000, and legal fees of $1,000.\n\n     2In December  1988, the foreclosure  proceedings against the\nChroniak  residence  were  suspended pending  resolution  of  the\npresent litigation.  In October 1991, Chroniak settled her  claim\nagainst appellants.\n\n     3The original complaint alleged violations of  the Racketeer\nInfluenced  and Corrupt  Organizations  statute.   See 18  U.S.C.\n                                                      \n  1962(c).   The RICO claims  were dismissed and  form no part of\nthe present appeal.\n\n                                4\n\nStat. Ann.   398-A [hereinafter:  \"SMHLA\"], the complaint alleged\n\nthat  (1)  appellants  had  forfeited  their  \"right  to  collect\n\ninterest\"  on  the  notes  by  failing  to  state  the  \"rate  of\n\ninterest,\"  thereby entitling  plaintiffs  to a  \"refund\" of  all\n\ninterest payments  on the $75,000 note  (i.e., $74,768.94) (SMHLA\n                                             \n\n  3),4  (2)  appellants' violations  of  SMHLA,  section 3,  con-\n\nstituted  criminal offenses  because they  were  \"willful\" (SMHLA\n                  \n\n  7a),  and (3) appellants overstated by $7,000 the amount of the\n\nloan  proceeds  received  by  Pugliese on  the  second  note,  or\n\nincluded  a $7,000 prepayment penalty in the second note (SMHLA  \n\n2 (III, IV)).\n\n          Relying on the Consumer Protection Act, N.H. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn.   358-A [hereinafter:  \"CPA\"], plaintiffs claimed (1) actual\n\ndamages because appellants' violations  of the SMHLA  constituted\n\n\"unfair or  deceptive act[s]  or [trade] practice[s]\"  (CPA   2),\n\nand (2) double or treble damages because appellants' violation of\n\nsection 2 of the CPA was \"willful or knowing\" (CPA   10). \n\n          Finally,  relying on  the  Unfair Collection  Practices\n\nAct, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   358-C [hereinafter:  \"UCPA\"],  plain-\n\ntiffs claimed that (1) appellants qualified both as \"debt collec-\n\ntors\" \n\n                    \n\n     4The complaint did not  demand reimbursement of the interest\npaid on the $27,000 note  but merely a declaration that the  note\nhad been  satisfied by plaintiffs' payments  totalling $20,000 in\nprincipal, an issue  which the jury resolved adversely  to appel-\nlants.\n\n                                5\n\n(UCPA   1)  and \"creditors\" engaged in  \"consumer credit transac-\n\ntions\"  in  the \"ordinary  course  of  business,\" (2)  appellants\n\nattempted  to  collect  interest  on  the  $75,000  note5 \"in  an\n\nunfair,  deceptive,  or  unreasonable  manner,\"  as the  interest\n\ncharges were  not \"expressly  authorized\" by the  loan agreement,\n\nhence were  not \"legally chargeable\" to the plaintiffs (UCPA    2\n\n&amp; 3), and  (3) appellants' violation  of the UCPA  simultaneously\n\nviolated CPA,  section 2,  which authorizes awards  of double  or\n\ntreble damages (UCPA   4(IV)).\n\n          Appellants initially were  granted summary judgment  on\n\nthe ground that the  SMHLA, whose violation formed the  bases for\n\nliability under  the CPA and  the UCPA, exempted  appellants from\n\nall  liability because  (1) Roberts  was not  licensed  under the\n\nSMHLA  to conduct  \"the business  of [providing]  second mortgage\n\nloans,\"  and (2)  both loans  were \"incidental\" to  Roberts' real\n\nestate  investment business.    On appeal,  these questions  were\n\ncertified to  the New  Hampshire Supreme Court,  which determined\n\nthat  the  SMHLA applies  both to  licensed  lenders and  to \"any\n                                                        \n\nperson making a loan secured by  a mortgage.\"  Chroniak v.

Thereafter, the summary judgment was vacated on appeal\n\nand the case was remanded for trial.\n\n          In its final  charge to  the jury,  the district  court\n\nread  verbatim excerpts  from the  three New  Hampshire statutes.\n                       \n\nThe  jury ultimately  responded in  the following  manner to  the\n\nspecial verdict form and a special interrogatory:\n\n          1.   The loans extended by  Golden Investment\n               Corporation  to   Thomas  Pugliese  were\n               incidental to the  conduct or the opera-\n                         \n               tion   of   the   business   of   Golden\n               Investment Corporation.

The    $75,000    and    $27,000    loan\n               transactions were not \"strictly private\"\n               in nature  and  were undertaken  in  the\n               \"ordinary   course   of   a   trade   or\n               business.\"  (Questions 4,5)\n\n          4.

Appellants concede  that the\n     \n\nverdicts may have been based  on their failure to state the  rate\n\nof  interest  in  the   promissory  notes,  which  constituted  a\n\npredicate violation of  both the CPA and the UCPA.   On the other\n\nhand, appellants argue  that the  jury simply  may have  bypassed\n\nconsideration  of the CPA and the UCPA altogether, instead basing\n\nits award  solely on appellants' direct  \"technical\" violation of\n                 \n\nthe disclosure requirements in SMHLA, section 3:\n\n                    \n\n     6Although it is undisputed that the jury found that Pugliese\nsustained  monetary  damages  as  a  consequence  of  appellants'\n\"knowing\" failure to disclose the rate of interest in the promis-\nsory  notes,  three  factors  hamper our  review  of  appellants'\nvarious challenges to the jury instructions.  First, the district\ncourt  read  verbatim  excerpts  from  the  three  New  Hampshire\n                               \nstatutes, but  during its  deliberations the jury  apparently was\nprovided with unexcerpted photocopies  of the statutes, including\n                         \nextraneous, uninstructed  portions.   Second,  the jury  received\nlittle guidance as to  whether (or how) the three  statutes might\nbe  interrelated.   Finally,  the special  verdict  form did  not\nrequire the jury to indicate the statutory provision on which its\naward was based.   Consequently, we must scrutinize the statutes,\nthe jury charge, and the special verdict form to  ensure that the\njury  verdicts were  not predicated  on any  impermissible basis,\nincluding an  incorrect application of the statutory  law.

Appellants  further argue  that  the  plain\n\nlanguage of section 3 merely affords  the borrower an affirmative\n\ndefense in any action initiated by the lender to collect interest\n       \n\non the note, and unlike other sections of the SMHLA (e.g.,    2 &amp;\n                                                         \n\n7), affords the borrower no affirmative right to recover interest\n\npaid to the lender.7  \n\n          The  procedural  peregrinations  of the  present  claim\n\nalmost daunt description.   Appellants raised the claim initially\n\nin their motion for summary judgment, see supra  pp. 6-7, but the\n                                               \n\ndistrict court  granted summary judgment on  an alternate ground.\n\nOn appeal, the summary  judgment was vacated.   Following remand,\n\nappellants renewed  their motion for summary  judgment.  Pugliese\n\nopposed  summary   judgment  on   the  ground  that   a  criminal\n                                                                 \n\n(\"willful\") violation of SMHLA,  section 3, would give rise  to a\n\ncommon-law cause of  action for restitution of  the interest paid\n\non  the illegal  loan.    Prior  to  trial,  the  district  court\n\npurportedly  granted appellants'  motion to  dismiss the  \"common\n\n                    \n\n     7We reject appellants' contention that the complaint did not\nallege that  SMHLA,   3, created  an independent cause  of action\nfor rescission of the  loan agreement and refund of  the interest\npayments.   Count one alleged that the $75,000 note was \"illegal\"\nand  \"[p]laintiffs are  entitled  to have  all interest  payments\nrefunded. . . .\"\n\n                                9\n\nlaw\" claims based on SMHLA, section 3.  Thus, the  jury was given\n\nno instruction on any \"common law\" claims based on SMHLA, section\n\n3.\n\n          Normally, this  would end  our inquiry.   As previously\n\nsuggested, however,  two factors  aligned to configure  a correct\n\njury  instruction  on  the applicable  law.    In  the course  of\n\ndefining  the predicate conduct that could serve as an \"unfair or\n\ndeceptive\"  trade practice under the CPA and the UCPA, sections 2\n\nand 3  of the SMHLA  were read, verbatim, to  the jury.   But the\n                                        \n\ncourt  did not  instruct the  jury  that it  could  not return  a\n                                                                 \n\nverdict based exclusively on the  provisions of SMHLA, section 3.\n                                                                \n\nMoreover, the court later  denied Pugliese's request for attorney\n\nfees because it could  not discern whether the jury  had premised\n\nits verdict exclusively on SMHLA, section 3, the  only one of the\n                       \n\nthree statutes presented to the jury which does not authorize fee\n\nshifting.  See infra pt. II.B.\n                    \n\n          We  agree   with  the  district  court   that  no  mere\n\n\"technical\" violation of SMHLA,  section 3, could give rise  to a\n\ncommon-law cause  of action  for restitution.8   Nevertheless, we\n          \n\nconclude  that  the  SMHLA,  holistically  construed,  creates  a\n\n                    \n\n     8Pugliese  based this  implied  private cause  of action  on\n                                   \nKaramanou v.

In Karamanou and  its progeny,\n                                               \nhowever, the defendants committed criminal violations of statutes\n                                          \ndesigned to  protect the plaintiffs.   Pugliese  pursued no  such\nallegation,  nor did he make  it the subject  of a special inter-\nrogatory.  See infra note 17.\n                    \n\n                                10\n\nstatutory cause of action for so-called \"technical\" violations of\n         \n\nsection 3.   First,  a jury  determination that  Roberts violated\n\nSMHLA,  section  3,   necessarily  would  entail  a   concomitant\n\nviolation  of SMHLA,  section 2  (also read  to the  jury), which\n\nstates in pertinent part:\n\n          The  allowable rate  of interest  computed on\n                                                    \n          the  unpaid  balance  that  any   person  may\n          directly  or  indirectly   charge,  take   or\n                                                       \n          receive for a second mortgage loan secured by\n                 \n          property which  is occupied in whole  or part\n          at  the time said loan  is made as  a home by\n          any obligor  on the  mortgage debt or  by any\n          person  granting  or  releasing any  interest\n          under said mortgage shall be  the rate agreed\n                                                       \n          upon  in the  note between  the  borrower and\n                            \n          lender, and following the sixth month  of any\n          period in which a loan has been in continuous\n          default not more than 1-1/2 percent per month\n          [18% annual] on any unpaid balances.\n\n(Emphasis added.)  The synergism between  sections 2 and 3 of the\n\nSMHLA  derives from  their  shared  use  of  the  term  \"rate  of\n\ninterest.\"  Under section 2, a lender may not compute (hence, may\n\nnot receive) interest at a \"rate\" not  \"agreed upon in the note.\"\n           \n\nThus, a covered lender's  receipt of interest charges based  on a\n\nnote which discloses no rate of interest violates both sections 2\n                                                      \n\nand 3.   Furthermore,  SMHLA, section  7,  provides in  pertinent\n\npart:\n\n          Any loan made in violation of  [section] 398-\n                                                       \n          A:2 by  any person  shall be  discharged upon\n             \n          payment or tender by the debtor or any person\n          succeeding  to  his  interest  in  such  real\n          estate   of   the   principal  sum   actually\n          borrowed.    The  superior court  shall  have\n          jurisdiction  of all suits  arising under RSA\n                                                       \n          398-A:2 and  if a  finding is made  that such\n                 \n          loan  secured by  any such  mortgage violates\n          said section such borrower shall  be entitled\n                                    \n          as part of  his costs to a reasonable fee for\n                                                       \n\n                                11\n\n          the services of his attorney in such suit.\n                                      \n\n(Emphasis added.)  Accordingly,  as the New Hampshire Legislature\n\ninarguably afforded  borrowers a right of  action for restitution\n\nof  the interest paid in  excess of the  interest \"agreed upon in\n\nthe note,\"9 SMHLA,   2, even  a jury verdict based exclusively on\n\na so-called  \"technical\" failure to disclose the rate of interest\n\nwould comport with the applicable New Hampshire law as instructed\n\nby the district court.10\n\n     2.  \"Unfair or Deceptive Act or \n          Practice\" Under CPA, Section 2\n                                        \n\n          Appellants contend  that  it was  reversible  error  to\n\ninstruct the jury that the mere omission of the rate of  interest\n\n                    \n\n     9We  ascribe  no  controlling  significance  to  the  jury's\nfailure to award Pugliese  the entire amount of interest  paid on\nthe $75,000 note.   A lender who commits a  \"technical\" violation\nof a  credit disclosure statute  may be entitled  to set off  the\nreasonable  value of  the goods  or money  advanced while  in the\npossession of the buyer  or borrower.  See, e.g.,  General Motors\n                                                                 \nAcceptance Corp. v.

Appellants argue that:  (1) the New Hampshire\n\nLegislature   has  amended  several   other  consumer  protection\n\nstatutes so as to  make their violation a simultaneous  violation\n\nof  the CPA, section 2,  while prior SMHLA  amendments contain no\n\nsimilar cross-referencing provision, and (2) the evidence adduced\n\nat trial was insufficient to entitle Pugliese to such an instruc-\n\ntion, since the jury  reasonably could not have inferred  that he\n\nwas  treated  unfairly  or  otherwise  deceived  by   appellants'\n\nomissions.  \n\n          The current version of  section 2 lists thirteen unfair\n\nor deceptive acts or practices, but the listing is expressly made\n\nnon-exhaustive.    Although  the   statute  provides  no  further\n\nexplication  and  New Hampshire  caselaw is  sparse, consultation\n\nwith both federal and Massachusetts precedent is encouraged.11\n\n                    \n\n     11The CPA itself provides that  courts should \"be guided  by\nthe interpretation and construction  given Section 5(a)(1) of the\nFederal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)), by the Federal\nTrade Commission and the  federal courts.\"  N.H.

The  SMHLA provides  but two  remedies for  violations of\n\nSMHLA, section  3.   If a  lender knowingly16  omits the  rate of\n\ninterest  from a promissory note    willfully or otherwise    the\n\nborrower may  maintain a  private  cause of  action under  SMHLA,\n\nsections 2, 3  and 7,  to recover  any interest  received by  the\n\nlender in excess of the interest rate \"agreed upon in the  note.\"\n\nSee supra pt. II.A.1.   If the section 3 violation was \"willful,\"\n         \n\nhowever,  the lender is  subject to  criminal penalties  as well.\n\nSMHLA, section 7a, provides:\n\n          Any   person   who   wilfully  violates   any\n                                                 \n          provision  of this  chapter [SMHLA]  shall be\n          guilty of a misdemeanor if  a natural person,\n          or guilty  of a  felony if any  other person,\n          for each such violation.\n\n(Emphasis added.)  \n\n          The special  verdict form reflects a  jury finding that\n\nappellants \"knowingly\"  failed to disclose the  rate of interest.\n\nSince the  \"willfulness\" element (i.e., appellants'  knowledge or\n                                      \n\ndisregard of the statutory requirement that the  rate of interest\n\n                    \n\n     16As the notes were prepared  by Roberts' attorney, the jury\nwas  asked  to  determine whether  Roberts  had  notice that  the\npercentage  rates of  interest  were omitted,  and whether  these\nomissions had the capacity to deceive, within the meaning of CPA,\n  2.\n\n                                19\n\nbe stated in  the note) would be relevant  only to the imposition\n\nof a criminal penalty  under section 7a (section 7a  never having\n\nbeen read to the jury),  the failure to give a \"specific  intent\"\n\ninstruction was  \"harmless\" error  at most;17  at best, the  jury\n\ninstruction  amounted to beneficial  error, as  it placed  on the\n\nplaintiff a more difficult burden of proof.  \n\n          The  only other  statute  to which  a determination  of\n\n\"willfulness\"  would have been relevant is CPA, section 10, which\n\nprovides  that \"[i]f the [factfinder]  finds that the  use of the\n\nmethod of competition  or the act or  practice was a  willful and\n                                                                 \n\nknowing violation of  this chapter, it shall  award as much as  3\n       \n\ntimes,  but not  less  than 2  times,  such amount.\"    (Emphasis\n\nadded.)  Like SMHLA, section 7a, this portion of CPA, section 10,\n\nwas never read to the  jury.18  The special verdict form  did not\n\nrequest a finding as  to whether plaintiff's \"damages\" should  be\n\ndoubled or trebled, and the district court did not in fact double\n\nor  treble the award.  Any error in the \"willfulness\" instruction\n\nwas therefore harmless.\n\n     4.  \"Incidental\" Exemption Instruction\n                                           \n\n          SMHLA,   section  10(II),  exempts  from  its  coverage\n\n\"individuals  or corporations who  make mortgage loans incidental\n                                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     17In closing argument, plaintiff's counsel never referred to\na \"criminal\" violation of the SMHLA.  Moreover, the jury instruc-\ntion  simply referred  to  a \"violation\"  of  SMHLA,   3,  not  a\n\"criminal violation.\"\n\n     18Prior to  the jury charge,  plaintiff's counsel disclaimed\ndouble or treble damages.\n\n                                20\n\nto the conduct or the operation of another business, such as real\n                                                                 \n\nestate  or  construction.\"    (Emphasis added.)    The  jury  was\n                        \n\ninstructed to determine:  (1) whether \"the principal  activity of\n\nGolden Investment Corporation\" was real estate investment and (2)\n\nif so, whether these  loans were \"incidental\" to its  real estate\n\ninvestment  business.    The  district  court  defined  the  term\n\n\"incidental\" to encompass a matter which \"inseparably depends on,\n\npertains  to, and is subordinate to the main or principal project\n\n[of the business].\"\n\n          Appellants argue that  the court improperly required  a\n\nthreshold determination  that  the principal  activity of  Golden\n\nInvestment was  real estate investment,  thereby disenfranchising\n\nits  defense if the jury found that general investment was Golden\n                                           \n\nInvestment's principal business activity.  We disagree.  \n\n          Section 10 itself restricts  the exemption to a limited\n\ncategory  of businesses;  namely, those  already engaged  in real\n                                                                 \n\nestate-related activities \"such  as\" real estate construction  or\n      \n\ninvestment.   In real  estate-related activities, there  exists a\n\ngreater business  need to afford mortgage loan  financing to cus-\n\ntomers  as an  ancillary commercial  service.   Cf. Moore  v.

The necessary nexus was not\n\n                                21\n\nlost  on the district court; its instruction required the jury to\n\nconsider  whether the  loans \"inseparably  depend[ed]\" on  appel-\n\nlants' main business activity.19\n\n          Appellants  claim that  the jury  should have  been in-\n\nstructed that  \"incidental\" means \"occurring merely  by chance or\n\nwithout intention or calculation,  or being likely to inure  as a\n\nminor  consequence.\"     To  the  extent   appellants  suggest  a\n\ndefinition  based on mere  fortuity, it clearly  does not comport\n\nwith the statutory context, or the legislative intent, underlying\n\nthe section  10 exemption.20    Moreover, we  see no  significant\n\ndifference between the language  utilized in the jury instruction\n\n(\"subordinate  to the main or principal  project\") and the second\n\nelement in  the definition proposed by  appellants (\"minor conse-\n\nquence\"), as  both  require the  jury  to determine  whether  the\n\nsecond  mortgage lending  activity on  which Pugliese's  cause of\n\naction  is predicated  constituted a  relatively minor  aspect of\n                                                \n\nappellants' overall  business activity.  We  find further support\n\nfor our  interpretation of the  term \"incidental\" in  the opinion\n\npreviously rendered by  the New Hampshire  Supreme Court in  this\n\ncase:\n\n                    \n\n     19We note further that appellants did not produce sufficient\nevidence to  support their contention that  Golden Investment was\nformed to engage in  general investment.  The two  mortgage loans\nto  Pugliese  were the  only  significant  business conducted  by\n                            \nappellants during the entire time period at issue in the case.\n\n     20The  first  element  in  the  proposed   definition  seems\nespecially  discordant  in  the  present context,  as  few  loans\ntotalling  $95,000 could ever be found to have been made \"without\nintention or calculation.\"\n\n                                22\n\n          [L]oans  made  by  a  corporation  formed  to\n          engage in  real estate investment  are exempt\n                                           \n          from  the requirements of  RSA chapter 398-A,\n          assuming they are \"incidental\" to the conduct\n          of that business.  . . . [W]e  do not  ignore\n          the  improbability that  a loan  advanced for\n          purposes of posting bail or purchasing a boat\n          trailer could ever  be considered  incidental\n          to the  business of a  corporation formed  to\n          engage in real estate investment.\n                                          \n\nChroniak v.

The evidence not only showed that\n\nthese  loans were not a  subordinate or minor  activity of Golden\n\nInvestment,  the evidence disclosed that Golden Investment's only\n                                                                 \n\nsignificant income-generating activity during the entire relevant\n\nperiod derived from these two loans to Pugliese.\n\n          We conclude that the jury instruction on SMHLA, section\n\n10, did not constitute reversible error.21\n\n                    \n\n     21Appellants raise four other unsuccessful claims on appeal,\nbased   generally  on   their   characterization  of   the   jury\ninstructions  as  \"confusing.\"     First,  appellants  failed  to\npreserve their claim that the jury may  have been misled when the\ndistrict court read CPA,   10, out of sequence (i.e., between its\n                                                    \nreading of SMHLA,   3, and SMHLA,   10).  When asked by the court\nwhether the  provision of  photocopies of  these statutes  to the\njury in  the correct  sequential order would  satisfy appellants'\nobjections, defense counsel responded in the affirmative.\n          Second,  appellants  maintain  that the  statutes  were\ninherently confusing, and  should not have been  read verbatim to\nthe  jury.  We do  not conclude that  the statutes are inherently\nconfusing;  moreover, even  such a  conclusion would  not benefit\nappellants since the jury was guided by the special verdict form,\nwhich described  the essential findings required  under the three\nstatutes.  See supra p. 7.  \n                    \n          Third,  appellants argue  that  the  court should  have\ndefined  the  statutory term  \"ordinary  course  of business,\"  a\nrelevant  term under  both the  CPA and  the UCPA.

The Pugliese Cross-appeal\n                             \n\n          Pugliese claims  he was  entitled  to recover  attorney\n\nfees  because the jury  must have based  its award on  one of the\n\nthree  fee shifting statutes (SMHLA,     2 &amp; 7;  CPA,   10; UCPA,\n\n  4).22    The  district  court  denied  an  attorney  fee  award\n\nbecause  it  could not  exclude  the  possibility that  the  jury\n\nverdict was based on  a violation of SMHLA, section 3, which does\n\nnot authorize attorney fees.  As we have determined that a viola-\n\ntion of SMHLA, section 3, would necessarily entail a violation of\n\nSMHLA, section 2,  see supra pt. II.A.1, we are  able to conclude\n                            \n\nthat the jury verdict was based on a fee shifting statute, either\n\nSMHLA,    2 &amp; 7, CPA,    2 &amp; 10, or UCPA,    2 &amp; 4.  Accordingly,\n\nwe  remand  for reconsideration  of the  motion  for an  award of\n\nattorney fees.\n\n                    \n\n(1978)).  UCPA,   1, likewise provides in pertinent part:\n\n     IV.   \"Creditor\"  means a  person who  in  the ordinary\n                                                            \n     course   of  business   engages   in  consumer   credit\n                          \n     transactions with consumers.\n\n(Emphasis added.)  We do not believe the term \"ordinary course of\nbusiness\" was  used in any  technical sense, or  required further\nexplanation by the  court.  The  special verdict form  adequately\nformulated  the  essential   distinction  raised  by  appellants'\ndefense      whether  appellants  were engaged  in  a  \"business\"\nactivity when they loaned these funds to Pugliese, or whether the\nloans were between \"private\" individuals.\n     Finally, appellants  incorrectly  assert that  the  district\ncourt  did  not  read  the  statutory  definition  of  \"creditor\"\nappearing in UCPA,   1(IV).  See Tr. at 771-72.\n                                \n\n     22Pugliese theorized that the jury must  have found that the\n$27,000 note  contained a  $7,000 prepayment penalty,  which con-\nstituted an independent violation of SMHLA,   2.  See supra p. 3.\n                                                           \nWe need not address this issue.\n\n                                24\n\n          The district  court judgment is affirmed  on the merits\n                                                                 \n\nand the case is remanded for reconsideration of the motion for an\n                                                                 \n\naward of attorney fees.\n                      \n\n                                25\n</pre>",
