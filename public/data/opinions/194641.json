The defendant, Peter\n          BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge\n                                      \n\nN.  Georgacarakos, appeals his  conviction of possession with\n\nintent  to  distribute and  distribution  of  cocaine on  the\n\ngrounds that the district  court's jury instructions on venue\n\nwere  erroneous,  and that  his  defense  was flawed  by  the\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel.   We decline  to consider\n\nthe defendant's  ineffective assistance  claim which  was not\n\nraised before the district court.   The jury instructions  on\n\nvenue, to  which  defendant-appellant now  objects, were  not\n\nobjected  to after the charge as required by Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n30.  We find  that the instructions did not  constitute plain\n\nerror and affirm the conviction.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          During October, 1991,  Frank \"Tony\" Porcaro  agreed\n\nto cooperate with the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\")\n\noffice and the South  Portland Police Department in Maine  on\n\nsupervised undercover  drug purchases from drug  dealers.  In\n\nhis role  as an  undercover informant, Porcaro  contacted the\n\ndefendant, whom  he had known  for several months,  and asked\n\nthe defendant to help him purchase cocaine.  Porcaro told the\n\ndefendant that he owed money to dangerous people, that he had\n\nresorted to desperate methods to get money for repayment, and\n\nthat he had  to get cocaine in order to pay them back.  After\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nseveral calls from Porcaro, the defendant  agreed to help him\n\nbuy  cocaine.  The  DEA and South  Portland police instructed\n\nand  supervised  Porcaro  in  the  undercover  operation, and\n\nprovided  Porcaro  with  all  necessary  equipment  including\n\nsubstantial amounts of money for  the cocaine purchases and a\n\n\"body wire\" recording device to record his conversations with\n\nthe defendant.  \n\n          The  defendant  and  Porcaro  made   two  trips  to\n\nLawrence, Massachusetts, one on  October 25 and the other  on\n\nNovember  15, 1991, to purchase  cocaine.  On  both days, the\n\ndefendant called his source in Lawrence before he and Porcaro\n\nbegan their  journey.   Porcaro drove  borrowed cars  on both\n\ntrips  and  the  defendant  was  the  only  passenger.    The\n\ndefendant  admits that  he purchased  cocaine with  Porcaro's\n\nmoney  and then  gave the cocaine  to him.   He  testified at\n\ntrial and argues  on appeal  that he purchased  and gave  the\n\ncocaine to  Porcaro in  Massachusetts.  Porcaro  testified to\n\nthe contrary  that on both  occasions the defendant  kept the\n\ncocaine  until they  reached  their  destinations  in  Maine.\n\nPorcaro  testified that on October 25, the defendant kept the\n\ncocaine in his pants until  they reached Scarborough where he\n\nhanded Porcaro  the cocaine wrapped in  a napkin.  As  to the\n\nNovember 15 trip, Porcaro  testified that the defendant again\n\nkept the  cocaine during the trip  back to Maine  and that he\n\nnever saw the cocaine.  Porcaro  testified that he drove to a\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nprearranged  meeting  place, a  motel  parking  lot in  South\n\nPortland.   In the parking lot,  Porcaro got out  of the car,\n\nand police  and DEA agents  surrounded the  car.  Two  of the\n\nagents  testified  that they  saw  the  defendant moving  and\n\nleaning forward toward the dashboard  before he put his hands\n\nup as ordered.  The agents  found a package of cocaine in the\n\nglove  compartment  of  the   car  after  the  defendant  was\n\narrested.  \n\n          Venue  was  the  primary  focus  of   the  defense.\n\nDefense  counsel objected  to  the district  court's proposed\n\njury instructions on venue before counsels' closing arguments\n\nto the jury and before the court gave the charge to the jury.\n\nWhen the court gave  counsel an opportunity to object  to the\n\ninstructions after  the charge  and before the  jury retired,\n\ndefense counsel raised other issues, but did not object again\n\nto the instructions  on venue.  The jury found that venue was\n\nproper in  Maine,  and found  the  defendant guilty  on  both\n\ncounts.  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\n\n                           ANALYSIS\n                                   \n\n           The defendant  raises two  issues on appeal:   (1)\n\nerror in the district court's jury instructions on venue, and\n\n(2) ineffective assistance of  counsel due to trial counsel's\n\nfailure to pursue the defense of entrapment.  \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nA.  Jury Instructions on Venue\n                              \n\n          During the  charge to the jury,  the district court\n\ngave  instructions on  venue which  the defendant  claims are\n\ncontrary to the  law because they allowed the jury to take an\n\nimpermissibly  broad  view  of conduct  relevant  to  proving\n\nvenue.         Proper venue  in a  criminal prosecution  is a\n\nconstitutional right:  \n\n          the Framers wrote  into the  Constitution\n          that \"The Trial of all Crimes . . . shall\n          be  held  in  the  State  where  the said\n          Crimes  shall have  been committed.  . .\"\n          Article  III,   2,  cl. 3.   As though to\n          underscore   the   importance   of   this\n          safeguard,  it  was  reinforced   by  the\n          provision of the Bill of Rights requiring\n          trial \"by an impartial  jury of the State\n          and district wherein the crime shall have\n          been committed.\" Sixth Amendment. \n\nUnited  States v. Johnson, 323 U.S. 273, 275 (1944); see also\n                                                             \n\nFed. R.  Crim. P.  18.  If  the federal statute  defining the\n\ncrime charged does not indicate a method  for determining the\n\nlocation  of  the  crime for  venue,  the  location  \"must be\n\ndetermined  from  the nature  of  the crime  alleged  and the\n\nlocation  of the act or acts constituting it.\"  United States\n                                                             \n\nv.  Anderson, 328 U.S. 699, 703 (1946).  Because venue is not\n            \n\nan element of the offense, the government bears the burden of\n\nproving venue by a preponderance  of the evidence rather than\n\nby the  higher standard, beyond  a reasonable doubt.   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Hall, 691 F.2d 48, 50 (1st Cir. 1982).   \n              \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          The  defendant  in this  case  was  charged in  two\n\ncounts  with  violation  of  21  U.S.C.     841(a)(1)  and   \n\n841(b)(1)(C):   Count One  charged possession with  intent to\n\ndistribute and  distribution of cocaine on  October 25, 1991,\n\nand Count Two charged possession with intent to distribute on\n\nNovember  15, 1991.  The  statute does not  indicate a method\n\nfor  determining  venue.   Continuing  crimes,  i.e.,  crimes\n\ncommitted in  more  than one  district,  are governed  by  18\n\nU.S.C.    3237(a).1  Distribution and  possession with intent\n\nto distribute drugs are continuing crimes.   United States v.\n                                                          \n\nUribe, 890 F.2d 554, 558-59 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v.\n                                                          \n\nKiser, 948 F.2d 418,  425 (8th Cir. 1991), cert.  denied, 112\n                                                        \n\nS.  Ct.  1666  (1992).    Therefore,  venue  for  the  crimes\n\nprosecuted  in this case was proper in any district where the\n\ncrimes began, continued or were completed.   \n\n          In order  to decide  where the crimes  occurred, we\n\nmust  determine what  acts by  the defendant  constituted the\n\ncrimes  charged.  Johnston v.   United States,  351 U.S. 215,\n                                             \n\n220-21 (1956).  To determine venue, we examine \"the key verbs\n\n                    \n\n1  18 U.S.C.   3237(a) provides in pertinent part:\n\n             (a)  Except   as  otherwise  expressly\n          provided  by  enactment of  Congress, any\n          offense against the  United States  begun\n          in one district and completed in another,\n          or committed in  more than one  district,\n          may be inquired of  and prosecuted in any\n          district in which such offense was begun,\n          continued, or completed.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nin the statute  defining the  criminal offense\"  to find  the\n\nscope of  relevant conduct.   United States  v. Tedesco,  635\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 902,  905 (1st Cir. 1980),  cert.  denied, 452  U.S. 962\n                                              \n\n(1981);  see also United States v. Griffin, 814 F.2d 806, 810\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir.  1987).    The  key verbs  relevant  to the  crimes\n\ncharged  in  this case  are  \"distribute\"  and \"possess  with\n\nintent to distribute.\"   Actions which are merely preparatory\n\nor prior to the crime are not probative in determining venue.\n\nUnited States  v. Beech-nut  Nutrition Corp., 871  F.2d 1181,\n                                            \n\n1190  (2d  Cir.), cert.  denied  sub nom.,  Lavery  v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates,  493 U.S. 933 (1989).  Therefore, only actions by the\n      \n\ndefendant which constitute  either distributing or possessing\n\nwith   intent  to   distribute  cocaine   are  probative   in\n\ndetermining venue for  those offenses.  Griffin,  814 F.2d at\n                                               \n\n810; United States v. Davis, 666 F.2d 195, 200 (5th Cir. Unit\n                           \n\nB  1982).   Jury   instructions  on  venue must  restrict the\n\njury's focus to the defendant's conduct which constituted the\n\ncrimes charged.\n\n          The   jury   instructions   which   the   defendant\n\nchallenges were as follows:\n\n          Now  both counts  charge that  the crimes\n          occurred in  the  district of  Maine  and\n          elsewhere.    It  is  sufficient  if  the\n          government proves by  a preponderance  of\n          the evidence, in other words, that  it is\n          more  likely than  not, that  any act  in\n                                                   \n          furtherance   of   the   crimes   charged\n                                                   \n          occurred in Maine.  Offenses beginning in\n                           \n          one  district and completed in another or\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          committed in more  than one district  may\n          be prosecuted in either such district.\n                            . . .\n             Let me summarize this for you.  If you\n          are convinced beyond  a reasonable  doubt\n          that  the  defendant distributed  cocaine\n          and  possessed cocaine with the intent to\n          distribute it, on  a date reasonably near\n          October  25, 1991, and  you are convinced\n          that it is more  likely than not that the\n          defendant  did   any  act  in   Maine  in\n                                                   \n          furtherance of this crime, then  you must\n                                   \n          convict him on Count One.  Otherwise, you\n          must acquit him on Count One.\n             If  [you]  are   convinced  beyond   a\n          reasonable   doubt  that   the  defendant\n          possessed  cocaine  with  the  intent  to\n          distribute  it on a  date reasonably near\n          November  15, 1991, and you are convinced\n          that it is more  likely than not that the\n          defendant   did  any  act   in  Maine  in\n                                                   \n          furtherance  of this crime, then you must\n                                    \n          convict him on Count Two.  Otherwise, you\n          must acquit him on Count Two.\n\nRecord at 461, 464 (emphasis added).  The          emphasized\n\nlanguage, which is challenged by the defendant, appropriately\n\ndescribes venue  for a  conspiracy charge or  for aiding  and\n\nabetting others in commission of a crime.

In Leary, id., the defendant challenged\n                                   \n\nthe  constitutionality of a  statutory presumption  which was\n\nthe  basis  for one  of  two  alternative theories  of  guilt\n\npresented  to  the jury.   The  Supreme  Court held  that the\n\nstatutory  presumption was unconstitutional  and reversed the\n\nconviction.  In Rodriguez, 465 F.2d 5,  the issue of venue of\n                         \n\nthe crime of  uttering a  forged check was  submitted to  the\n\njury  on  two  alternative  theories of  guilt:    aiding and\n\nabetting the crime  or that  the crime of  uttering a  forged\n\ncheck  was  a \"continuing  offense\" pursuant  to 18  U.S.C.  \n\n3237.   The court held that  because the crime of  uttering a\n\nforged  check  was  not  a continuing  offense,  one  of  the\n\ntheories was incorrect, and  reversed the conviction based on\n\nthe Leary rule.\n         \n\n          In this case, the jury instructions did not present\n\ntwo alternative theories of  guilt.  Rather, the instructions\n\nimpermissibly broadened  the scope of conduct  which the jury\n\nmight have  considered in determining venue.

An analogous  rule,\n\nwhich  is more closely related to this case, provides \"that a\n\ngeneral  verdict must be set aside if the jury was instructed\n\nthat it could rely on any of two or more independent grounds,\n\nand one of those grounds is insufficient, because the verdict\n\nmay  have rested  exclusively  on the  insufficient  ground.\"\n\nZant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862,  881 (1983).

United States v. Ochs, 842\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 515,  520 (1st  Cir. 1988).   Based on  a review  of the\n\ntrial  record, there  can be no  uncertainty that  the jury's\n\nverdict on venue was based on sufficient grounds. \n\n          There  were two  versions  of events  of the  trips\n\npresented  to the jury through  testimony at trial.  Porcaro,\n\nthe   informant,   testified  that   during  both   trips  to\n\nMassachusetts, the defendant kept the package of cocaine with\n\nhim until they  arrived back  in Maine.   Based on  Porcaro's\n\ntestimony,  there   is  no  question  that   the  jury  could\n\nsustainably  have found  that  the  defendant  possessed  and\n\ndistributed the cocaine in Maine during the October 25  trip,\n\nand possessed  the cocaine  in Maine  during the  November 15\n\ntrip.   The defendant  testified, however, that  during their\n\nfirst trip to  Massachusetts he handed the package of cocaine\n\nto  Porcaro while they were still in Lawrence and Porcaro put\n\nthe  package under  his seat.   The defendant  testified that\n\nduring  the second trip he  handed the package  of cocaine to\n\nPorcaro  before they left  Lawrence, and Porcaro  put it into\n\nthe glove  compartment.  The  defendant contends that  he did\n\nnot possess  or distribute  the  cocaine in  Maine on  either\n\ntrip.   He argues that if the jury believed him, there was no\n\nproper  basis for venue in Maine  because the crimes occurred\n\nin Massachusetts.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n          The  defendant  relies  on  three  cases  involving\n\npossession  with  intent to  distribute  drugs  in which  the\n\ncourts found  that venue was improper  because the defendants\n\nwere prosecuted in districts in which they had neither actual\n\nnor  constructive possession  of the  contraband.   In United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.  Delgado, 914 F.2d  1062, 1064-65 (8th  Cir. 1990),\n                  \n\nthe court found that  venue was improper in North  Dakota for\n\nprosecution of  the defendant  for possession with  intent to\n\ndistribute cocaine  because  neither the  defendant  nor  the\n\ncocaine  ever  entered North  Dakota.   In  United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nMedina-Ramos, 834 F.2d  874, 877 (10th Cir. 1987),  the court\n            \n\nfound that venue was improper in New Mexico where the cocaine\n\ntravelled without  the defendants  who were removed  from the\n\ntrain in  California because  \"the locus of  the constructive\n\npossession, the  locus of  a crime committed  by constructive\n\npossession,  cannot be a place  where the defendant has never\n\nbeen, personally or by a  person whose acts are  attributable\n\nto him.\" Id.  In United States v. Davis, 666 F.2d at 200, the\n                                       \n\ncourt found that venue,  for a substantive possession charge,\n\nwas improper in Georgia because the defendants never actually\n\nor  constructively possessed  the  drugs while  they were  in\n\nGeorgia.  None of these cases are apposite.  \n\n          The   defendant's   reasoning  ignores   his  close\n\nconnection with the cocaine during both trips back  to Maine,\n\neven according to his  own version of events.   The defendant\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nrode   back  to  Maine  with  the  cocaine  in  the  car,  in\n\ncircumstances which show  that he had either actual  or joint\n\nconstructive  possession of  the cocaine  in Maine.   Illegal\n\npossession of  drugs \"can be actual or  constructive, sole or\n\njoint.\"  United  States v.  Wight, 968 F.2d  1393, 1397  (1st\n                                 \n\nCir. 1992); United States  v. Vargas, 945 F.2d 426,  428 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir.  1991).   Although  mere  association  with someone  who\n\npossesses  drugs   is   insufficient  to   show   possession,\n\nconstructive possession  exists  if the  defendant knows  the\n\ndrugs  are available and has the power and intent to exercise\n\ndominion and control over them.  United States v. Garcia, No.\n                                                        \n\n92-1427,  slip op. at 6-7  (Feb. 4, 1993,  1st Cir.)

Constructive  possession may be\n\nproven by  direct or circumstantial evidence.   United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Martinez, 922 F.2d 914, 923-24 (1st Cir. 1991).\n           \n\n          The   district  court   instructed   the  jury   on\n\nconstructive  and  joint   possession,  without   objection.3\n\nDuring their deliberations, the jury requested a  copy of the\n\nindictment and a written clarification of the instructions on\n\npossession, distribution,  and intent to  distribute.   After\n\n                    \n\n3            The  law   recognizes  also  different\n          kinds of possession.   A person  may have\n          actual    possession   or    constructive\n          possession.   And possession  may be sole\n          or  possession may  be  joint.    Neither\n          proof  of  physical   proximity  to   the\n          cocaine,  nor  the mere  association with\n          someone  who does  control  it  is  alone\n          enough    to    establish    actual    or\n          constructive possession.\n             A  person  who  has   direct  physical\n          control  of something  on  or around  his\n          person  is then  in actual  possession of\n          it.    A  person  who is  not  in  actual\n          possession,  but who  has both  the power\n          and  the intention  to take  control over\n          something   later   is  in   constructive\n          possession of it.\n             If  one  person  alone  has  actual or\n          constructive  possession,  possession  is\n          sole, sole possession.\n             If two or more persons share actual or\n          constructive  possession,  possession  is\n          joint.  Joint possession.\n             Whenever   I   have   used  the   word\n          possession in these instructions,  I mean\n          actual as well as constructive, and joint\n          as well as sole possession.\nRecord at 463.\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\ndiscussion with counsel, the trial judge sent the jury copies\n\nof the  indictment  and of  the  instructions, which  he  had\n\npreviously  read to  them,  on possession,  distribution  and\n\nintent to distribute  and joint and  constructive possession.\n\nThe jury was thoroughly  instructed that possession  includes\n\njoint  and  constructive  possession in  addition  to  actual\n\npossession.  The  defendant does not  dispute that he  bought\n\nthe cocaine for  Porcaro and  always intended to  give it  to\n\nhim. Intent to distribute,  therefore, is not disputed.   The\n\ndefendant argues that distribution  of the cocaine to Porcaro\n\nin Massachusetts ended the  crimes there.  We disagree.   The\n\ncrimes  continued  into  Maine because  the  cocaine remained\n\naccessible to the  defendant who had  purchased it, who  knew\n\nwhere it  was, and who could  have retrieved it at  any time.\n\nThe defendant remained  in constructive  joint possession  of\n\nthe cocaine during  the trip back to  Maine based on  his own\n\ntestimony.   Accepting  the  defendant's version  of  events,\n\nconstructive possession  ended and distribution  occurred, on\n\nthe first trip, when  Porcaro dropped him off in Maine and he\n\nleft the cocaine in the car with Porcaro.   The defendant was\n\nnot charged with distribution on the second trip.  Therefore,\n\neven based  on the  defendant's  version of  events for  both\n\ntrips,   the   defendant's   continued   joint   constructive\n\npossession of  the cocaine with Porcaro  and his distribution\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nto Porcaro in  Maine, on  the first trip,  was sufficient  to\n\nestablish venue in Maine. \n\n          When proof of venue is  so clear that no reasonable\n\njuror   could  have   found  otherwise,  an   erroneous  jury\n\ninstruction on venue is  not plain error.  See,  e.g., United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.  Martinez,  901  F.2d  374,  376  (4th Cir.  1990)\n                    \n\n(holding that failure to instruct on venue was not reversible\n\nerror  where clear proof  of venue existed);  see also United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.

Although the district court's\n      \n\ninstructions on venue included an overly broad description of\n\nconduct  relevant for  determining venue,  the error  did not\n\nresult in a violation of the defendant's constitutional right\n\nto venue in the district where the crimes were committed.  If\n\nthe jury believed Porcaro's testimony,  the government proved\n\nactual possession  and distribution of the  cocaine in Maine.\n\nEven if the jury believed the defendant's  testimony, that he\n\ndelivered  the  cocaine  to  Porcaro  in  Massachusetts,  the\n\nevidence  at  trial  established  constructive  and/or  joint\n\npossession  of the cocaine in Maine.  Based on either version\n\nof events,  the jury  had sufficient  grounds to  find proper\n\nvenue.    We hold  that  the erroneous  instructions  did not\n\nresult  in  a  miscarriage  of  justice  in  this  case,  and\n\ntherefore, did not constitute plain error.\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nB.  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n                                     \n\n          The   defendant  appeals  his   conviction  on  the\n\nadditional  ground that  he  lacked effective  assistance  of\n\ncounsel  due  to his  trial  counsel's failure  to  pursue an\n\nentrapment defense.  The defendant  argues that the facts and\n\ncircumstances  of the  case  support  an entrapment  defense.\n\nDuring  cross-examination  of the  defendant,  the prosecutor\n\nasked whether  defense counsel  was relying on  an entrapment\n\ndefense.   Defense counsel,  when pressed, responded  that he\n\nwould have to consult  with the defendant before he  could be\n\nsure.    The court  then  proceeded  on  the assumption  that\n\nentrapment  would not  be used  as a  defense unless  defense\n\ncounsel  notified  the  court  otherwise.    Defense  counsel\n\napparently did not  raise the entrapment defense  again.  The\n\nissue  of ineffective  assistance of  counsel was  not raised\n\nbefore the trial court.  \n\n          The general rule is  that we will not hear  a claim\n\nof  ineffective assistance  of counsel  raised for  the first\n\ntime on direct  appeal.

We cannot\n\ndetermine from the record,  for example, whether counsel made\n\na tactical  decision not to  pursue entrapment, and  to focus\n\nthe  defense on the venue  issue instead.   See, e.g., United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.

Be that  as it may, the  court, after finding\n\nwhat  it thinks is error, concludes  that the perceived error\n\nwas neither  plain nor  prejudicial, see  ante at 16-17,  and\n                                              \n\ndecides that  the defendant's  conviction should stand.

Georgacarakos, appeals his  conviction of possession with\n\nintent  to  distribute and  distribution  of  cocaine on  the\n\ngrounds that the district  court's jury instructions on venue\n\nwere  erroneous,  and that  his  defense  was flawed  by  the\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel.   We decline  to consider\n\nthe defendant's  ineffective assistance  claim which  was not\n\nraised before the district court.   The jury instructions  on\n\nvenue, to  which  defendant-appellant now  objects, were  not\n\nobjected  to after the charge as required by Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n30.  We find  that the instructions did not  constitute plain\n\nerror and affirm the conviction.\n\n                              I.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          During October, 1991,  Frank \"Tony\" Porcaro  agreed\n\nto cooperate with the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\")\n\noffice and the South  Portland Police Department in Maine  on\n\nsupervised undercover  drug purchases from drug  dealers.  In\n\nhis role  as an  undercover informant, Porcaro  contacted the\n\ndefendant, whom  he had known  for several months,  and asked\n\nthe defendant to help him purchase cocaine.  Porcaro told the\n\ndefendant that he owed money to dangerous people, that he had\n\nresorted to desperate methods to get money for repayment, and\n\nthat he had  to get cocaine in order to pay them back.  After\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nseveral calls from Porcaro, the defendant  agreed to help him\n\nbuy  cocaine.  The  DEA and South  Portland police instructed\n\nand  supervised  Porcaro  in  the  undercover  operation, and\n\nprovided  Porcaro  with  all  necessary  equipment  including\n\nsubstantial amounts of money for  the cocaine purchases and a\n\n\"body wire\" recording device to record his conversations with\n\nthe defendant.  \n\n          The  defendant  and  Porcaro  made   two  trips  to\n\nLawrence, Massachusetts, one on  October 25 and the other  on\n\nNovember  15, 1991, to purchase  cocaine.  On  both days, the\n\ndefendant called his source in Lawrence before he and Porcaro\n\nbegan their  journey.   Porcaro drove  borrowed cars  on both\n\ntrips  and  the  defendant  was  the  only  passenger.    The\n\ndefendant  admits that  he purchased  cocaine with  Porcaro's\n\nmoney  and then  gave the cocaine  to him.   He  testified at\n\ntrial and argues  on appeal  that he purchased  and gave  the\n\ncocaine to  Porcaro in  Massachusetts.  Porcaro  testified to\n\nthe contrary  that on both  occasions the defendant  kept the\n\ncocaine  until they  reached  their  destinations  in  Maine.\n\nPorcaro  testified that on October 25, the defendant kept the\n\ncocaine in his pants until  they reached Scarborough where he\n\nhanded Porcaro  the cocaine wrapped in  a napkin.  As  to the\n\nNovember 15 trip, Porcaro  testified that the defendant again\n\nkept the  cocaine during the trip  back to Maine  and that he\n\nnever saw the cocaine.  Porcaro  testified that he drove to a\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nprearranged  meeting  place, a  motel  parking  lot in  South\n\nPortland.   In the parking lot,  Porcaro got out  of the car,\n\nand police  and DEA agents  surrounded the  car.  Two  of the\n\nagents  testified  that they  saw  the  defendant moving  and\n\nleaning forward toward the dashboard  before he put his hands\n\nup as ordered.  The agents  found a package of cocaine in the\n\nglove  compartment  of  the   car  after  the  defendant  was\n\narrested.  \n\n          Venue  was  the  primary  focus  of   the  defense.\n\nDefense  counsel objected  to  the district  court's proposed\n\njury instructions on venue before counsels' closing arguments\n\nto the jury and before the court gave the charge to the jury.\n\nWhen the court gave  counsel an opportunity to object  to the\n\ninstructions after  the charge  and before the  jury retired,\n\ndefense counsel raised other issues, but did not object again\n\nto the instructions  on venue.  The jury found that venue was\n\nproper in  Maine,  and found  the  defendant guilty  on  both\n\ncounts.  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\n\n                           ANALYSIS\n                                   \n\n           The defendant  raises two  issues on appeal:   (1)\n\nerror in the district court's jury instructions on venue, and\n\n(2) ineffective assistance of  counsel due to trial counsel's\n\nfailure to pursue the defense of entrapment.  \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nA.  Jury Instructions on Venue\n                              \n\n          During the  charge to the jury,  the district court\n\ngave  instructions on  venue which  the defendant  claims are\n\ncontrary to the  law because they allowed the jury to take an\n\nimpermissibly  broad  view  of conduct  relevant  to  proving\n\nvenue.         Proper venue  in a  criminal prosecution  is a\n\nconstitutional right:  \n\n          the Framers wrote  into the  Constitution\n          that \"The Trial of all Crimes . . . shall\n          be  held  in  the  State  where  the said\n          Crimes  shall have  been committed.  . .\"\n          Article  III,   2,  cl. 3.   As though to\n          underscore   the   importance   of   this\n          safeguard,  it  was  reinforced   by  the\n          provision of the Bill of Rights requiring\n          trial \"by an impartial  jury of the State\n          and district wherein the crime shall have\n          been committed.\" Sixth Amendment. \n\nUnited  States v.

If  the federal statute  defining the\n\ncrime charged does not indicate a method  for determining the\n\nlocation  of  the  crime for  venue,  the  location  \"must be\n\ndetermined  from  the nature  of  the crime  alleged  and the\n\nlocation  of the act or acts constituting it.\"  United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

The defendant  testified, however, that  during their\n\nfirst trip to  Massachusetts he handed the package of cocaine\n\nto  Porcaro while they were still in Lawrence and Porcaro put\n\nthe  package under  his seat.   The defendant  testified that\n\nduring  the second trip he  handed the package  of cocaine to\n\nPorcaro  before they left  Lawrence, and Porcaro  put it into\n\nthe glove  compartment.  The  defendant contends that  he did\n\nnot possess  or distribute  the  cocaine in  Maine on  either\n\ntrip.   He argues that if the jury believed him, there was no\n\nproper  basis for venue in Maine  because the crimes occurred\n\nin Massachusetts.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n          The  defendant  relies  on  three  cases  involving\n\npossession  with  intent to  distribute  drugs  in which  the\n\ncourts found  that venue was improper  because the defendants\n\nwere prosecuted in districts in which they had neither actual\n\nnor  constructive possession  of the  contraband.

After\n\n                    \n\n3            The  law   recognizes  also  different\n          kinds of possession.   A person  may have\n          actual    possession   or    constructive\n          possession.   And possession  may be sole\n          or  possession may  be  joint.    Neither\n          proof  of  physical   proximity  to   the\n          cocaine,  nor  the mere  association with\n          someone  who does  control  it  is  alone\n          enough    to    establish    actual    or\n          constructive possession.\n             A  person  who  has   direct  physical\n          control  of something  on  or around  his\n          person  is then  in actual  possession of\n          it.    A  person  who is  not  in  actual\n          possession,  but who  has both  the power\n          and  the intention  to take  control over\n          something   later   is  in   constructive\n          possession of it.\n             If  one  person  alone  has  actual or\n          constructive  possession,  possession  is\n          sole, sole possession.\n             If two or more persons share actual or\n          constructive  possession,  possession  is\n          joint.  Joint possession.\n             Whenever   I   have   used  the   word\n          possession in these instructions,  I mean\n          actual as well as constructive, and joint\n          as well as sole possession.\nRecord at 463.\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\ndiscussion with counsel, the trial judge sent the jury copies\n\nof the  indictment  and of  the  instructions, which  he  had\n\npreviously  read to  them,  on possession,  distribution  and\n\nintent to distribute  and joint and  constructive possession.\n\nThe jury was thoroughly  instructed that possession  includes\n\njoint  and  constructive  possession in  addition  to  actual\n\npossession.  The  defendant does not  dispute that he  bought\n\nthe cocaine for  Porcaro and  always intended to  give it  to\n\nhim. Intent to distribute,  therefore, is not disputed.   The\n\ndefendant argues that distribution  of the cocaine to Porcaro\n\nin Massachusetts ended the  crimes there.  We disagree.   The\n\ncrimes  continued  into  Maine because  the  cocaine remained\n\naccessible to the  defendant who had  purchased it, who  knew\n\nwhere it  was, and who could  have retrieved it at  any time.\n\nThe defendant remained  in constructive  joint possession  of\n\nthe cocaine during  the trip back to  Maine based on  his own\n\ntestimony.   Accepting  the  defendant's version  of  events,\n\nconstructive possession  ended and distribution  occurred, on\n\nthe first trip, when  Porcaro dropped him off in Maine and he\n\nleft the cocaine in the car with Porcaro.   The defendant was\n\nnot charged with distribution on the second trip.  Therefore,\n\neven based  on the  defendant's  version of  events for  both\n\ntrips,   the   defendant's   continued   joint   constructive\n\npossession of  the cocaine with Porcaro  and his distribution\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nto Porcaro in  Maine, on  the first trip,  was sufficient  to\n\nestablish venue in Maine. \n\n          When proof of venue is  so clear that no reasonable\n\njuror   could  have   found  otherwise,  an   erroneous  jury\n\ninstruction on venue is  not plain error.

Although the district court's\n      \n\ninstructions on venue included an overly broad description of\n\nconduct  relevant for  determining venue,  the error  did not\n\nresult in a violation of the defendant's constitutional right\n\nto venue in the district where the crimes were committed.  If\n\nthe jury believed Porcaro's testimony,  the government proved\n\nactual possession  and distribution of the  cocaine in Maine.\n\nEven if the jury believed the defendant's  testimony, that he\n\ndelivered  the  cocaine  to  Porcaro  in  Massachusetts,  the\n\nevidence  at  trial  established  constructive  and/or  joint\n\npossession  of the cocaine in Maine.  Based on either version\n\nof events,  the jury  had sufficient  grounds to  find proper\n\nvenue.    We hold  that  the erroneous  instructions  did not\n\nresult  in  a  miscarriage  of  justice  in  this  case,  and\n\ntherefore, did not constitute plain error.\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nB.  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n                                     \n\n          The   defendant  appeals  his   conviction  on  the\n\nadditional  ground that  he  lacked effective  assistance  of\n\ncounsel  due  to his  trial  counsel's failure  to  pursue an\n\nentrapment defense.  The defendant  argues that the facts and\n\ncircumstances  of the  case  support  an entrapment  defense.\n\nDuring  cross-examination  of the  defendant,  the prosecutor\n\nasked whether  defense counsel  was relying on  an entrapment\n\ndefense.   Defense counsel,  when pressed, responded  that he\n\nwould have to consult  with the defendant before he  could be\n\nsure.    The court  then  proceeded  on  the assumption  that\n\nentrapment  would not  be used  as a  defense unless  defense\n\ncounsel  notified  the  court  otherwise.    Defense  counsel\n\napparently did not  raise the entrapment defense  again.  The\n\nissue  of ineffective  assistance of  counsel was  not raised\n\nbefore the trial court.  \n\n          The general rule is  that we will not hear  a claim\n\nof  ineffective assistance  of counsel  raised for  the first\n\ntime on direct  appeal.
