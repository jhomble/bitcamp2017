In  this appeal,  defendant\n                              \n\nRaymond Lee Higgins argues that the district court improperly\n\ndenied his request for in camera disclosure of a confidential\n                                \n\ngovernment informant.   Finding  that the district  court did\n\nnot abuse  its discretion in denying  defendant's request, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                BACKGROUND &amp; PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                              \n\n          In  January of 1992,  Detective Captain Rick Frazee\n\nof  the Fairfield,  Maine, Police  Department learned  from a\n\nconfidential informant  that  defendant,  a  parolee  from  a\n\nfederal drug trafficking  conviction, was regularly supplying\n\nDaryl  Coskery,   another  known  drug  dealer,   with  large\n\nquantities of marijuana.  The informant also told Frazee that\n\ndefendant  and  Coskery intended  to  drive  from Waterville,\n\nMaine,  to Virginia  Beach,  Virginia, in  order to  purchase\n\n$50,000.00 worth of marijuana.   He provided such details  as\n\nthe  car in which the defendant and Coskery would travel, and\n\nthe approximate dates and times of departure and return.  \n\n          Using this information, Frazee, along  with Kenneth\n\nMacMaster,  a   Special  Agent  with  the   Maine  Bureau  of\n\nIntergovernmental Drug Enforcement (BIDE), and two other BIDE\n\nagents, observed  defendant and Coskery leaving  the state at\n\nthe time and in the manner predicted by the informant.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          Based   on  these  facts  and  their  corroborative\n\nsurveillance, MacMaster  sought  a warrant  to  search,  upon\n\ndefendant's  return to  Maine, his  car and  home for  drugs,\n\nevidence  of  drug trafficking,  and  firearms.   MacMaster's\n\nsearch warrant affidavit outlined the events described above,\n\nand attested  to the confidential informant's  reliability as\n\nestablished  by his  previous participation  in approximately\n\nsix earlier  controlled drug  buys which resulted  in arrests\n\nand  convictions.   A  State of  Maine  District Court  Judge\n\nissued the warrant.\n\n          Pursuant to the warrant, defendant  was apprehended\n\nupon his return to Maine by police officers positioned at the\n\nstate line.   The ensuing  car search yielded  less than  one\n\nounce of marijuana.   The search of  defendant's home yielded\n\nanother small marijuana supply  in addition to four firearms.\n\nOn February 13, 1992, defendant was indicted in federal court\n\non four counts of possession of a  firearm in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C.    922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2).1\n\n                    \n\n1.  18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1) provides in relevant part:  \n\n     It shall  be unlawful for  any person who  has been\n     convicted in  any court  of, a crime  punishable by\n     imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; to .  .\n     . possess . . . any firearm or ammunition . . . .\n\n     18 U.S.C.   924(a)(2) governs fines and imprisonment for\nviolations of   922(g)(1).  The crime for which defendant was\nparoled   at  the  time  of  his  arrest  was  punishable  by\nimprisonment for more than one year. \n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          On  March  3,  1992,  defendant filed  a  pre-trial\n\nmotion  seeking,  inter alia,  in  camera  disclosure of  the\n                                         \n\nconfidential  informant's identity.    Defendant argued  that\n\nsuch  disclosure was necessary in  order for him  to make the\n\npreliminary showing required to  obtain a Franks  suppression\n                                                \n\nhearing.2    A Magistrate  Judge  recommended  denial of  the\n\nrequest, and on May 28, 1992, the district court reviewed and\n\naccepted that recommendation.  Following a one-day jury trial\n\non June 6, 1992, defendant was convicted on all counts.    \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          On appeal, defendant argues that the district court\n\nerred  in denying his request for in camera disclosure of the\n                                           \n\nconfidential informant's identity.  We do not agree.\n\n          When the government obtains a  search warrant based\n\non   information  provided   by  a   confidential  informant,\n\ndefendants often  lack the  information required to  meet the\n\n                    \n\n2.  Under Franks v.  Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1977), a\n                             \ndefendant may obtain  a suppression hearing if  s/he \"makes a\nsubstantial  preliminary  showing  that  a   false  statement\nknowingly and intentionally,  or with reckless  disregard for\nthe  truth, was included in the warrant affidavit, and if the\nallegedly  false statement  is  necessary to  the finding  of\nprobable cause . . . .\"  If, at the hearing, it is determined\nthat such  a false statement was  intentionally or recklessly\nincluded in the warrant affidavit, evidence obtained pursuant\nto the false statement must be suppressed.  Id. at 156.\n                                               \n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nexacting standards of Franks.3   See, e.g., United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nSouthard, 700  F.2d 1, 10-11 (1st Cir. 1983).  In such cases,\n        \n\ndistrict  courts may  conduct in  camera examinations  of the\n                                        \n\naffiant and,  if necessary,  of  the informant,  in order  to\n\ndetermine whether disclosure of the  confidential informant's\n\nidentity  would  enable  the  defendant to  obtain  a  Franks\n                                                             \n\nhearing.  Id.   \n             \n\n          However, \"a  district court need not  conduct an in\n                                                             \n\ncamera  hearing  whenever the  identity  of  an informant  is\n      \n\nrequested.\"  United States v. Fixen, 780 F.2d 1434, 1439 (9th\n                                   \n\nCir.  1986).  Rather, \"it should rest entirely with the judge\n\nwho hears  the motion  to suppress  to decide  whether [s/]he\n                                                             \n\nneeds  such disclosure as to the informant in order to decide\n\n                    \n\n3.  Franks, 438 U.S.  at 171, provides  a clear standard  for\n          \ndetermining   whether  a  defendant  has  made  a  sufficient\npreliminary showing to obtain a hearing:\n\n     There is, of course, a presumption of validity with\n     respect  to  the  affidavit  supporting  the search\n     warrant.   To mandate an  evidentiary hearing,  the\n     challenger's  attack must  be more  than conclusory\n     and must be supported by more than a mere desire to\n     cross-examine.     There  must  be  allegations  of\n     deliberate falsehood  or of reckless  disregard for\n     the   truth,   and   those   allegations   must  be\n     accompanied  by an  offer  of proof.   They  should\n     point out  specifically the portion  of the warrant\n     affidavit  that is  claimed to  be false;  and they\n     should  be accompanied by a statement of supporting\n     reasons.  Affidavits or sworn or otherwise reliable\n     statements of  witnesses  should be  furnished,  or\n     their  absence  satisfactorily   explained.     The\n     deliberate  falsity  or  reckless  disregard  whose\n     impeachment is  permitted  . .  .  is that  of  the\n     affiant, not of any nongovernmental informant.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nwhether the officer is a believable  witness.\"  United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

Finally,  \"a  decision denying  a\n\ndefendant's  request for  an in  camera proceeding  should be\n                                       \n\noverturned  only if there is an abuse of discretion.\"  Fixen,\n                                                            \n\n780 F.2d  at 1439.  Our  careful review of the  record in the\n\ninstant case shows no abuse of discretion.  \n\n          Defendant's motion for in camera  disclosure begins\n                                          \n\nby naming  an  individual,  Matthew  Tulley,  whom  defendant\n\nsuspects was the confidential informant.   The motion goes on\n\nto suggest that  Tulley was aware that defendant  and Coskery\n\nplanned an  innocent trip  to Virginia,  but that  Tulley, in\n\nconcert with Frazee and MacMaster, fabricated the notion that\n\nthe trip was  for the  purpose of purchasing  marijuana.   If\n\ntrue,  these allegations  might raise  serious constitutional\n\nissues.  Defendant fails, however, to offer proof of any fact\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nthat  is materially  inconsistent with  the facts  recited in\n\nMacMaster's search warrant affidavit.\n\n          First,  defendant  offers   to  prove  that  Tulley\n\nlearned of the trip through an acquaintance, Dale Peters, and\n\nthat  Peters never told Tulley  that the purpose  of the trip\n\nwas  to  purchase marijuana.    Defendant  does not  contend,\n\nhowever, that Peters was the only person who knew of the trip\n\nto  Virginia.   Thus, even  if Tulley  was the  informant, he\n\nmight  easily have learned  additional information  about the\n\nillicit nature of the  trip from a source other  than Peters.\n\nAccordingly, defendant's offer  of proof regarding  Peters is\n\nnot at all inconsistent with MacMaster's affidavit.\n\n          Second,  defendant  offers  to prove  that  on  the\n\nevening of  defendant's and  Coskery's departure  from Maine,\n\nTulley,  under  the  surveillance  of Frazee  and  MacMaster,\n\nunsuccessfully attempted  to  make a  controlled purchase  of\n\nmarijuana from Coskery.  Moreover, defendant claims that this\n\nattempted purchase  was not  included  in MacMaster's  search\n\nwarrant affidavit.   Again, this  offer of  proof misses  the\n\nmark.   When  a defendant  offers proof  of an  omission, the\n\n\"issue  is  whether, even  had  the  omitted statements  been\n\nincluded in the affidavit, there was still probable cause  to\n\nissue the warrant.\"   United States v. Rumney, 867  F.2d 714,\n                                             \n\n720-21  (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 491 U.S. 908 (1989).  Here,\n                                \n\nthe   controlled   purchase  incident   is   not  necessarily\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\ninconsistent with any  of the other  events recounted in  the\n\nwarrant  affidavit.  Thus, even if the affidavit had included\n\nan account of  the incident,4 there were  still ample grounds\n\nfor a  finding of  probable  cause. Accordingly,  defendant's\n\noffer of proof regarding  the controlled purchase incident is\n\nnot materially inconsistent with MacMaster's affidavit.\n\n          In sum,  defendant has failed to  articulate how in\n                                                             \n\ncamera disclosure of  the informant's  identity would  enable\n      \n\nhim to obtain a Franks hearing.  On one hand, if an in camera\n                                                             \n\nhearing  disclosed  that  the  informant  was  Tulley,  there\n                                             \n\nremains   nothing  in  the  record,  aside  from  defendant's\n\nconclusory assertions  and insufficient  offers of proof,  to\n\nsupport the theory that  MacMaster submitted false statements\n\nin order to obtain the warrant.  On the other hand, if the in\n                                                             \n\ncamera hearing  disclosed that the informant  was not Tulley,\n                                                     \n\nthen  defendant  has  offered  no  alternative   grounds  for\n\nobtaining  a  Franks  hearing.5    Accordingly,  the district\n                    \n\n                    \n\n4.  Both  MacMaster and  Frazee submitted  affidavits stating\nthat,  while they took part in surveillance of Coskery on the\nevening of his departure  from Maine, neither knew of  a plan\nto make a controlled purchase of marijuana from  Coskery that\nevening.\n\n5.  We  note  additionally  that  defendant's  motion  for in\n                                                             \ncamera  disclosure was  seriously  inadequate in  form.   The\n      \nmotion was supported solely by an affidavit signed by defense\ncounsel.   The affidavit did not provide the sworn statements\nof  witnesses,  nor  did  it  explain  the  absence  of  such\nstatements,  as  required  by   Franks,  438  U.S.  154,  171\n                                      \n(\"Affidavits  or sworn  or otherwise  reliable statements  of\nwitnesses    should   be   furnished,    or   their   absence\nsatisfactorily  explained.\").

To the extent that defendant  raised this issue\nbelow, he did so in a perfunctory manner.  \"A party is not at\nliberty to  articulate specific arguments for  the first time\non  appeal simply  because the  general issue was  before the\ndistrict court.\"   United States  v.

In  this appeal,  defendant\n                              \n\nRaymond Lee Higgins argues that the district court improperly\n\ndenied his request for in camera disclosure of a confidential\n                                \n\ngovernment informant.   Finding  that the district  court did\n\nnot abuse  its discretion in denying  defendant's request, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                BACKGROUND &amp; PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                              \n\n          In  January of 1992,  Detective Captain Rick Frazee\n\nof  the Fairfield,  Maine, Police  Department learned  from a\n\nconfidential informant  that  defendant,  a  parolee  from  a\n\nfederal drug trafficking  conviction, was regularly supplying\n\nDaryl  Coskery,   another  known  drug  dealer,   with  large\n\nquantities of marijuana.  The informant also told Frazee that\n\ndefendant  and  Coskery intended  to  drive  from Waterville,\n\nMaine,  to Virginia  Beach,  Virginia, in  order to  purchase\n\n$50,000.00 worth of marijuana.   He provided such details  as\n\nthe  car in which the defendant and Coskery would travel, and\n\nthe approximate dates and times of departure and return.  \n\n          Using this information, Frazee, along  with Kenneth\n\nMacMaster,  a   Special  Agent  with  the   Maine  Bureau  of\n\nIntergovernmental Drug Enforcement (BIDE), and two other BIDE\n\nagents, observed  defendant and Coskery leaving  the state at\n\nthe time and in the manner predicted by the informant.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n          Based   on  these  facts  and  their  corroborative\n\nsurveillance, MacMaster  sought  a warrant  to  search,  upon\n\ndefendant's  return to  Maine, his  car and  home for  drugs,\n\nevidence  of  drug trafficking,  and  firearms.   MacMaster's\n\nsearch warrant affidavit outlined the events described above,\n\nand attested  to the confidential informant's  reliability as\n\nestablished  by his  previous participation  in approximately\n\nsix earlier  controlled drug  buys which resulted  in arrests\n\nand  convictions.   A  State of  Maine  District Court  Judge\n\nissued the warrant.\n\n          Pursuant to the warrant, defendant  was apprehended\n\nupon his return to Maine by police officers positioned at the\n\nstate line.   The ensuing  car search yielded  less than  one\n\nounce of marijuana.   The search of  defendant's home yielded\n\nanother small marijuana supply  in addition to four firearms.\n\nOn February 13, 1992, defendant was indicted in federal court\n\non four counts of possession of a  firearm in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C.    922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2).1\n\n                    \n\n1.  18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1) provides in relevant part:  \n\n     It shall  be unlawful for  any person who  has been\n     convicted in  any court  of, a crime  punishable by\n     imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; to .  .\n     . possess . . . any firearm or ammunition . . . .\n\n     18 U.S.C.   924(a)(2) governs fines and imprisonment for\nviolations of   922(g)(1).  The crime for which defendant was\nparoled   at  the  time  of  his  arrest  was  punishable  by\nimprisonment for more than one year. \n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          On  March  3,  1992,  defendant filed  a  pre-trial\n\nmotion  seeking,  inter alia,  in  camera  disclosure of  the\n                                         \n\nconfidential  informant's identity.    Defendant argued  that\n\nsuch  disclosure was necessary in  order for him  to make the\n\npreliminary showing required to  obtain a Franks  suppression\n                                                \n\nhearing.2    A Magistrate  Judge  recommended  denial of  the\n\nrequest, and on May 28, 1992, the district court reviewed and\n\naccepted that recommendation.  Following a one-day jury trial\n\non June 6, 1992, defendant was convicted on all counts.    \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          On appeal, defendant argues that the district court\n\nerred  in denying his request for in camera disclosure of the\n                                           \n\nconfidential informant's identity.  We do not agree.\n\n          When the government obtains a  search warrant based\n\non   information  provided   by  a   confidential  informant,\n\ndefendants often  lack the  information required to  meet the\n\n                    \n\n2.

Our  careful review of the  record in the\n\ninstant case shows no abuse of discretion.  \n\n          Defendant's motion for in camera  disclosure begins\n                                          \n\nby naming  an  individual,  Matthew  Tulley,  whom  defendant\n\nsuspects was the confidential informant.   The motion goes on\n\nto suggest that  Tulley was aware that defendant  and Coskery\n\nplanned an  innocent trip  to Virginia,  but that  Tulley, in\n\nconcert with Frazee and MacMaster, fabricated the notion that\n\nthe trip was  for the  purpose of purchasing  marijuana.   If\n\ntrue,  these allegations  might raise  serious constitutional\n\nissues.  Defendant fails, however, to offer proof of any fact\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nthat  is materially  inconsistent with  the facts  recited in\n\nMacMaster's search warrant affidavit.\n\n          First,  defendant  offers   to  prove  that  Tulley\n\nlearned of the trip through an acquaintance, Dale Peters, and\n\nthat  Peters never told Tulley  that the purpose  of the trip\n\nwas  to  purchase marijuana.    Defendant  does not  contend,\n\nhowever, that Peters was the only person who knew of the trip\n\nto  Virginia.   Thus, even  if Tulley  was the  informant, he\n\nmight  easily have learned  additional information  about the\n\nillicit nature of the  trip from a source other  than Peters.\n\nAccordingly, defendant's offer  of proof regarding  Peters is\n\nnot at all inconsistent with MacMaster's affidavit.\n\n          Second,  defendant  offers  to prove  that  on  the\n\nevening of  defendant's and  Coskery's departure  from Maine,\n\nTulley,  under  the  surveillance  of Frazee  and  MacMaster,\n\nunsuccessfully attempted  to  make a  controlled purchase  of\n\nmarijuana from Coskery.  Moreover, defendant claims that this\n\nattempted purchase  was not  included  in MacMaster's  search\n\nwarrant affidavit.   Again, this  offer of  proof misses  the\n\nmark.   When  a defendant  offers proof  of an  omission, the\n\n\"issue  is  whether, even  had  the  omitted statements  been\n\nincluded in the affidavit, there was still probable cause  to\n\nissue the warrant.\"   United States v.

To the extent that defendant  raised this issue\nbelow, he did so in a perfunctory manner.  \"A party is not at\nliberty to  articulate specific arguments for  the first time\non  appeal simply  because the  general issue was  before the\ndistrict court.\"   United States  v.
