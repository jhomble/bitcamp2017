Plaintiff  was injured on May 10, 1988, when the rear\n\nbumper  of a  mail truck  \"hooked\"  the front  bumper of  the\n\nparked car  in which she  was sitting.   Plaintiff  testified\n\nthat  she felt  neck pain  at the  time.   After  driving her\n\nbrother home and picking up her daughter at school, plaintiff\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nwent to the  hospital, was treated and discharged.   Her pain\n\nincreased two or three weeks  after the accident, and she was\n\nreferred to an orthopedic specialist.\n\n          In 1978  plaintiff injured  her back  at work.   In\n\n1984 or  1985 she  fell down some  stairs, injuring  her back\n\nagain.   In 1985 she  experienced \"severe\" neck pain, without\n\nany trauma, and was treated by a chiropractor.\n\n          Plaintiff  offered  the  expert  testimony  of  her\n\nneurologist, Dr. Fullerton,  via a videotape deposition.  Dr.\n\nFullerton was  her last  treating physician.   He ordered  an\n\nelectromyogram (EMG)  and magnetic  resonance imaging  (MRI).\n\nBased on these procedures, Dr. Fullerton found that there was\n\nno  significant nerve  defect, but  that there  was a  slight\n\nherniation  of the  C-4/C-5  disc.   It  was Dr.  Fullerton's\n\nopinion that the herniation and consequent pain was caused by\n\nthe accident involving the mail truck.  Dr. Fullerton had not\n\nbeen  informed  by  plaintiff  of  the  two  prior  accidents\n\ninvolving  her  back  or  the  trauma-absent  neck  pain  she\n\nexperienced in 1986.\n\n          Defendant's expert  witness was  Dr. Logigian.   He\n\nhad  examined plaintiff,  the EMG, and  MRI reports,  and was\n\nadvised  of plaintiff's  three prior  injuries.   It was  Dr.\n\nLogigian's  opinion that plaintiff's  pain was caused  by the\n\nherniated disc and the herniation  was not caused by the mail\n\ntruck accident.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\n          The  magistrate  judge  credited the  testimony  of\n\ndefendant's  expert over  that  of  plaintiff's.    That,  of\n\ncourse,  was   a   decision  entirely   within  the   court's\n\ndiscretion.\n\n          The trial court stated:\n\n             In  the   circumstances,  this   court\n          cannot  fairly   conclude  that   all  of\n                                               \n          plaintiff's medical  bills, lost  income,\n          or pain and  suffering, [were] caused  by\n                                               \n          the negligence of the  government.  To be\n          sure, as argued by counsel for plaintiff,\n          a  \"wrongdoer  [is] responsible  for  the\n          harmful results  of the  combined effects\n                                           \n          of  his wrongful  act  and a  preexisting\n          disease or  condition.\"  McGrath v.  G. &amp;\n                                                   \n          P. Thread  Corp.,  228  N.E.2d  450,  453\n                          \n          (Mass. 1967).  (Emphasis added).  That is\n          a  correct statement of the law so far as\n          it goes.  But the corollaries to the rule\n          also [apply]  - i.e., that a wrongdoer is\n                              \n          not  liable  for  damages  suffered by  a\n             \n          plaintiff which that plaintiff would have\n          suffered   solely  on   account  of   the\n          preexisting condition, or for damages for\n          a worsening of that preexisting condition\n          which  was  bound  to  occur even  if  no\n          further injury was suffered.  \n\n(Footnotes omitted.)\n\n          The  court pointed out  that plaintiff did  not try\n\nher case  on an \"aggravation\"  theory, \"at least [not]  by or\n\nthrough  her expert.\"    Our  examination  of  the  pleadings\n\nreveals  that neither  the first  nor  the amended  complaint\n\nstates  or implies that the accident aggravated an underlying\n\ninjury.  Count 5 of the amended complaint states:\n\n          As  a   result  [of  the   accident]  the\n          plaintiff   sustained   serious   injury,\n          suffered pain of body  and mind, incurred\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          medical  bills  and  has been  unable  to\n          perform her usual duties and activities.\n\n          The court held:\n\n             In   short,  this   court  finds   and\n          concludes that, although the accident did\n          cause some \"aggravation\" of a preexisting\n          injury immediately after  the injury, the\n          pain and suffering  about which plaintiff\n          now complains,  and most  of the  medical\n          bills incurred  by plaintiff, was  and is\n          the   sole  result   of  either   a  disc\n          herniation which preceded the accident in\n          question, or a condition which would have\n          occurred  even  in  the absence  of  that\n          accident.  (Footnote omitted.)\n\nThe court then awarded plaintiff $12,000 as damages.\n\n          We  have   fully  considered  all   of  plaintiff's\n\narguments and have  read the record  carefully.  Viewing  the\n\nevidence  and  findings  through  the  lens  of  the  clearly\n\nerroneous  standard  of  review,  we  find  no  basis  for  a\n\nchallenge to the trial court's findings and holding.\n\n                             II.\n\n          The  next issue  is  whether  the  court  erred  in\n\nallowing  defendant's   expert  to  testify   at  the  trial.\n\nPlaintiff's  argument is based on a claimed violation of Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 26(e)(1),1 which states:\n\n             A party is under  a duty seasonably to\n          supplement the  response with  respect to\n          any  question directly  addressed to  (A)\n          the  identity  and  location  of  persons\n          having knowledge of discoverable matters,\n\n                    \n\n1.  Rule  26(e) has been changed, effective December 1, 1993,\nbut the change neither affects subsection (1) nor plaintiff's\nargument.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          and  (B)  the  identity  of  each  person\n          expected  to  be  called   as  an  expert\n          witness at  trial, the subject  matter on\n          which the person  is expected to testify,\n          and   the  substance   of  the   person's\n          testimony.\n\n          Sometime  prior  to trial,  plaintiff  submitted an\n\ninterrogatory  to  defendant  that  requested  the  following\n\ninformation:  \"State  the names and addresses  of all persons\n\ndefendant intends to call  as a witness in  the trial of  the\n\nwithin  matter,  and   the  substance  of   said  testimony.\"\n\nAppellant's Brief at 19.  Two weeks prior to trial, defendant\n\nidentified Dr.  Logigian as  an expert  expected to  testify.\n\nPlaintiff contends  that this interrogatory was  not answered\n\nseasonably and therefore the testimony  of defendant's expert\n\nshould have been  excluded.  Plaintiff so moved  in the trial\n\ncourt prior to the start of trial.\n\n          The   question  is  whether  the  answer  was  made\n\nseasonably.2    The  facts  are  not  as  stark  as plaintiff\n\nsuggests.  The  best way to explain the  trial court's ruling\n\nis to quote directly from its opinion.\n\n             On or about March  25, 1993, plaintiff\n          filed a  motion in limine to preclude the\n          testimony of Dr.  Logigian on the grounds\n          that  he was not  listed as a  witness by\n          the government.\n\n             Given, however, that no pretrial order\n          as such, fixing witnesses, was entered by\n\n                    \n\n2.  Although the interrogatories and answers thereto were not\npart  of the record  below, we reject  defendant's contention\nthat we, therefore, should not consider this issue.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          this court, and given, as reported in the\n          motion,  that the plaintiff was - and had\n          been -  in possession  of Dr.  Logigian's\n          full  report  in   February,  this  court\n          denied that motion on March 25, 1993.\n\n             When   trial   began,    counsel   for\n          plaintiff was apparently  unaware of this\n          court's action on the motion.  The motion\n          was renewed.   At that  time, this  court\n          again denied the  motion, but made  clear\n          that the  court would revisit  the matter\n          if, after  direct examination,  plaintiff\n          could establish any prejudice.\n\n             Direct examination proceeded,  and Dr.\n          Logigian was  adequately and  competently\n          cross-examined by counsel  for plaintiff.\n          The  matter was not  again brought to the\n          attention of this court.\n\nApp. 187A, n.5.\n\n          Immediately  prior   to   the   start   of   trial,\n\nplaintiff's counsel admitted, in  reply to a question  by the\n\ncourt,  that the  report  furnished  him  contained  all  the\n\ninformation  that an answer  to the interrogatory  would have\n\ndisclosed.   And,  although arguing  that  disclosure of  the\n\nexpert's  report   came  too  late  for   necessary  in-depth\n\npreparation for cross-examination, plaintiff's lawyer did not\n\nrequest a continuance.\n\n          It is universally accepted that review of discovery\n\nsanctions must be made in  light of the \"abuse of discretion\"\n\nstandard.   See National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey\n                                                             \n\nClub, 427  U.S. 639, 642  (1976); Thibeault v.

And  we have  done so.   In Smith  v.\n                                                         \n\nMassachusetts  Inst. of Technology, 877 F.2d 1106 (1st Cir.),\n                                  \n\ncert. denied,  493 U.S.  965 (1989), we  held that  the trial\n            \n\ncourt did not  abuse its discretion in refusing  to strike an\n\nexpert's testimony.  Id. at  1112.  In that case,  we pointed\n                        \n\nout:\n\n          \"Courts  have looked  with disfavor  upon\n          parties who claim  surprise and prejudice\n          but who do  not ask for a recess  so they\n          may  attempt  to   counter  the  opponent\n          testimony.\" \n\nId. at 1111 (quoting Johnson  v.

Plaintiff testified that she felt neck pain at the time.  After driving her brother home and picking up her daughter at school, plaintiff went to the hospital, was treated and discharged.  Her pain increased two or three weeks after the accident, and she was referred to an orthopedic specialist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1978 plaintiff injured her back at work.  In 1984 or 1985 she fell down some stairs, injuring her back again.  In 1985 she experienced \"severe\" neck pain, without any trauma, and was treated by a chiropractor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff offered the expert testimony of her neurologist, Dr. Fullerton, via a videotape deposition.  Dr. Fullerton was her last treating physician.  He ordered an electromyogram (EMG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Based on these procedures, Dr. Fullerton found that there was no significant nerve defect, but that there was a slight herniation of the C-4/C-5 disc.  It was Dr. Fullerton's opinion that the herniation and consequent pain was caused by the accident involving the mail truck.  Dr. Fullerton had not been informed by plaintiff of the two prior accidents involving her back or the trauma-absent neck pain she experienced in 1986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's expert witness was Dr. Logigian.  He had examined plaintiff, the EMG, and MRI reports, and was advised of plaintiff's three prior injuries.  It was Dr. Logigian's opinion that plaintiff's pain was caused by the herniated disc and the herniation was not caused by the mail truck accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge credited the testimony of defendant's expert over that of plaintiff's.  That, of course, was a decision entirely within the court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The trial court stated:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the circumstances, this court cannot fairly conclude that all of plaintiff's medical bills, lost income, or pain and suffering, [were] caused by the negligence of the government.  To be sure, as argued by counsel for plaintiff, a \"wrongdoer [is] responsible for the harmful results of the combined effects of his wrongful act and a preexisting disease or condition.\"   McGrath v. G. &amp; P. Thread Corp., 228 N.E.2d 450, 453 (Mass. 1967).  (Emphasis added).  That is a correct statement of the law so far as it goes.  But the corollaries to the rule also [apply] i.e., that a wrongdoer is not liable for damages suffered by a plaintiff which that plaintiff would have suffered solely on account of the preexisting condition, or for damages for a worsening of that preexisting condition which was bound to occur even if no further injury was suffered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Footnotes omitted.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court pointed out that plaintiff did not try her case on an \"aggravation\" theory, \"at least [not] by or through her expert.\"  Our examination of the pleadings reveals that neither the first nor the amended complaint states or implies that the accident aggravated an underlying injury.  Count 5 of the amended complaint states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result [of the accident] the plaintiff sustained serious injury, suffered pain of body and mind, incurred medical bills and has been unable to perform her usual duties and activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court held:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>In short, this court finds and concludes that, although the accident did cause some \"aggravation\" of a preexisting injury immediately after the injury, the pain and suffering about which plaintiff now complains, and most of the medical bills incurred by plaintiff, was and is the sole result of either a disc herniation which preceded the accident in question, or a condition which would have occurred even in the absence of that accident.  (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then awarded plaintiff $12,000 as damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have fully considered all of plaintiff's arguments and have read the record carefully.  Viewing the evidence and findings through the lens of the clearly erroneous standard of review, we find no basis for a challenge to the trial court's findings and holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next issue is whether the court erred in allowing defendant's expert to testify at the trial.  Plaintiff's argument is based on a claimed violation of Fed.  R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement the response with respect to any question directly addressed to (A) the identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and (B) the identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial, the subject matter on which the person is expected to testify, and the substance of the person's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime prior to trial, plaintiff submitted an interrogatory to defendant that requested the following information:  \"State the names and addresses of all persons defendant intends to call as a witness in the trial of the within matter, and the substance of said testimony.\"  Appellant's Brief at 19.  Two weeks prior to trial, defendant identified Dr. Logigian as an expert expected to testify.  Plaintiff contends that this interrogatory was not answered seasonably and therefore the testimony of defendant's expert should have been excluded.  Plaintiff so moved in the trial court prior to the start of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is whether the answer was made seasonably.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The facts are not as stark as plaintiff suggests.  The best way to explain the trial court's ruling is to quote directly from its opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about March 25, 1993, plaintiff filed a motion in limine to preclude the testimony of Dr. Logigian on the grounds that he was not listed as a witness by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>Given, however, that no pretrial order as such, fixing witnesses, was entered by this court, and given, as reported in the motion, that the plaintiff was and had been in possession of Dr. Logigian's full report in February, this court denied that motion on March 25, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>When trial began, counsel for plaintiff was apparently unaware of this court's action on the motion.

At that time, this court again denied the motion, but made clear that the court would revisit the matter if, after direct examination, plaintiff could establish any prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Direct examination proceeded, and Dr. Logigian was adequately and competently cross-examined by counsel for plaintiff.  The matter was not again brought to the attention of this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">App. 187A, n. 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately prior to the start of trial, plaintiff's counsel admitted, in reply to a question by the court, that the report furnished him contained all the information that an answer to the interrogatory would have disclosed.  And, although arguing that disclosure of the expert's report came too late for necessary in-depth preparation for cross-examination, plaintiff's lawyer did not request a continuance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is universally accepted that review of discovery sanctions must be made in light of the \"abuse of discretion\" standard.   See National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, 427 U.S. 639, 642 (1976);   Thibeault v. Square D Co., 960 F.2d 239, 243 (1st Cir. 1992);   Freund v. Fleetwood Enters., Inc., 956 F.2d 354, 359 (1st Cir. 1992).  Although the usual sanction is preclusion of testimony, we see no reason not to apply an abuse of discretion standard when evidence is admitted.  And we have done so.  In  Smith v. Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, 877 F.2d 1106 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 965 (1989), we held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike an expert's testimony.  Id. at 1112.  In that case, we pointed out:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have looked with disfavor upon parties who claim surprise and prejudice but who do not ask for a recess so they may attempt to counter the opponent testimony.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1111 (quoting  Johnson v.
