Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                   Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     John M. Thompson, with whom Thompson & Thompson, P.C. was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Randall E. Ravitz, Assistant Attorney General, with whom\nThomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 1, 2007\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge. This case involves whether the\n\ndistrict    court   erred   in   not    applying      the    equitable   tolling\n\ndoctrine to excuse the late filing of a federal habeas petition\n\nwhere (1) the public-defender counsel for the state prisoner\n\nsimply made a mistake as to the habeas limitations period, and\n\n(2)   the   petitioner   makes   a     claim   that    the    totality    of   the\n\ncircumstances nonetheless warrants equitable tolling.\n\n            The Supreme Court has just rejected the argument that\n\nbecause the mistake was made by a state public defender and the\n\ndefendant himself was diligent, the defendant should not be held\n\nto the mistake of his lawyer.          Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U.S. ___,\n\nNo. 05-8820, 2007 WL 505972, at *6 (Feb. 20, 2007).                      Lawrence\n\nheld that\n\n            [a]ttorney   miscalculation    is    simply   not\n            sufficient to warrant equitable tolling,\n            particularly in the postconviction context\n            where prisoners have no constitutional right\n            to counsel. . . . [Petitioner] argues that\n            his   case  presents    special    circumstances\n            because the state courts appointed and\n            supervised his counsel. But a State's effort\n            to   assist    prisoners    in    postconviction\n            proceedings    does   not    make     the   State\n            accountable for a prisoner's delay.\n\nId. (citation omitted).\n\n            Trapp's main argument is slightly different from that\n\nrejected in Lawrence.        Trapp argues that Massachusetts has a\n\npolicy that whenever the state provides counsel to an indigent\n\nperson, that counsel is furnished with a guarantee of effective\n\n                                       -2-\n\fassistance.       Thus, he argues, he was entitled to rely on his\n\nattorney and should not be held responsible for her mistake.                     We\n\nhold that this is a distinction without a difference.                      Lawrence\n\nstill    governs.      The       result    Trapp     seeks    would   be    utterly\n\ninconsistent with Lawrence's rationale that equitable tolling is\n\nrare and available only in extraordinary circumstances.\n\n           Trapp's second argument is that the totality of the\n\ncircumstances qualifies him for equitable tolling, an argument\n\nrejected by the district court.                 We affirm the dismissal of the\n\npetition for failure to comply with the limitations period.\n\n                                          I.\n\n           We briefly recount the facts, which are recited in\n\ngreater detail in Commonwealth v. Trapp [Trapp I], 485 N.E.2d 162\n\n(Mass. 1985), and Commonwealth v. Trapp [Trapp II], 668 N.E.2d\n\n327 (Mass. 1996), affirming Trapp's conviction for murder and his\n\nlife sentence.\n\n           On May 8, 1981, Randall Trapp stabbed to death Lawrence\n\nNorton, a man he had met in a bar the night before.                        Following\n\nthe   stabbing,     which    occurred      in     Norton's    home,   Trapp    stole\n\nNorton's landlord's money and the landlord's mother's car.                    Trapp\n\nII, 668 N.E.2d at 329; Trapp I, 485 N.E.2d at 164.                         In 1982,\n\nTrapp was tried before a jury in Massachusetts state court.                       At\n\ntrial,   he   defended      on    the     ground    that     he   lacked   criminal\n\nresponsibility for his actions.             Trapp I, 485 N.E.2d at 164.          He\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fpresented expert testimony that the murder was the product of (1)\n\nan organic brain abnormality (caused by earlier head traumas,\n\nsome of which were the result of beatings by his father) and (2)\n\npsychological      stress     attributable      to    his      wife's   \"deviant\n\nbehavior,\" which included working as a prostitute and a stripper\n\nand being \"openly and promiscuously bisexual.\"              Id. at 164 & n.2.\n\nTrapp was convicted of first-degree murder, armed robbery, and\n\nlarceny of a motor vehicle, id. at 163, but the conviction was\n\noverturned on appeal because improper character evidence had been\n\nadmitted at trial, id. at 165.\n\n              Trapp was retried in 1987, and he again defended on the\n\nbasis that he was not criminally responsible.                    Trapp II, 668\n\nN.E.2d   at    329.    During   the   seven-day      trial,     seven   experts,\n\nincluding three for the prosecution and four for the defense,\n\ntestified on the issue of Trapp's criminal responsibility.                   Id.\n\nAs   part     of   their    testimony,      these    experts     offered   their\n\ninterpretations of a computed axial tomography (CAT) scan of\n\nTrapp's brain.1       In particular, Trapp's primary medical expert,\n\nDr. Vernon Mark, testified that the CAT scan showed an enlarged\n\narea in the \"right temporal horn\" where \"spinal fluid fill[ed]\n\nwithin the temporal lobe.\"        Trapp's experts offered testimony as\n\n     1\n          The prosecution also presented expert testimony on a BEAM\nanalysis that had been ordered by Trapp's trial counsel (but which\nhis counsel had not intended to use at trial).       Trapp II, 668\nN.E.2d at 332. The BEAM analysis, however, measures only activity\nat the surface of the brain, while Trapp's apparent brain defect is\ndeep within the brain.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fto the effects of such an abnormality, and testified that Trapp\n\nsuffered          from    intermittent     explosive      disorder     and     organic\n\npersonality disorder.               By contrast, the Commonwealth's primary\n\nmedical expert, Dr. Paul F. New, testified that Trapp's CAT scan\n\ndid not show an enlarged temporal horn or any brain abnormality.\n\nThe        Commonwealth's          additional     experts        offered     testimony\n\nconsistent with Dr. New's.             Trapp also presented the testimony of\n\nlay witnesses, who described occasions prior to the homicide on\n\nwhich Trapp had behaved strangely.                 Id.    After deliberating for\n\ntwo days, the jury convicted Trapp of first-degree murder based\n\non extreme atrocity or cruelty.2                  Id.     He was sentenced to a\n\nmandatory term of life imprisonment.\n\n                 Trapp appealed his conviction on a number of grounds.\n\nHe also moved in the state trial court for a new trial, claiming\n\nthat       his    trial   counsel    was   ineffective     because    he   failed    to\n\npresent certain evidence at trial and because his presentation of\n\nother evidence was not persuasive.                 The motion for a new trial\n\nwas denied, and Trapp's appeal therefrom was consolidated with\n\nhis appeal from his conviction.                  On July 31, 1996, the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court (SJC) affirmed Trapp's convictions.                    Id. at 333.\n\n                 Trapp then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari,\n\nwhich       was     denied    on     December    16,     1996.       See     Trapp   v.\n\n\n       2\n          Trapp also was again convicted of armed robbery and\nlarceny of a motor vehicle. Trapp II, 668 N.E.2d at 365 n.6.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fMassachusetts, 519 U.S. 1045 (1996).   As we explain below, it was\n\nat this point that the clock began to run on the one-year period\n\nfor the filing of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\n\nfederal court, subject to statutory exclusions.     See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2244(d)(1).\n\n          On July 31, 1997, Trapp filed in the state trial court\n\na second motion for a new trial, based on the facts that he had\n\nbeen \"forced\" to stand trial in prison clothing, that the record\n\nhad been \"deficient at the time of his direct appeal,\" and that\n\nthe prosecution had used at trial results of a BEAM analysis that\n\nTrapp's counsel originally had ordered but had not intended to\n\nuse and had not in fact used at trial.3 Trapp appended to his new\n\ntrial motion a motion requesting court-appointed counsel.      The\n\nmotions were denied on September 7, 1997.     On October 6, 1997,\n\nTrapp filed a gate-keeper motion requesting leave to appeal the\n\ndenial of his motions for a new trial and for appointment of\n\ncounsel to the SJC.   As grounds for a new trial he reasserted his\n\narguments that his constitutional rights had been violated when\n\nhe was forced to stand trial in prison clothing and when the\n\n\n\n     3\n          On direct appeal, Trapp had objected to the trial judge's\nallowing discovery of these BEAM test results. See Trapp II, 668\nN.E.2d at 332; see also supra note 1. The SJC held that even if it\nhad been error to permit the discovery, there had been no prejudice\nto Trapp because the test results were used only in rebuttal, the\nresults themselves were not put into evidence, and the results did\nnot contain any testimonial statements by Trapp. Trapp II, 668\nN.E.2d at 332.\n\n                                -6-\n\fprosecution was permitted to discover and use the results of the\n\nBEAM analysis.\n\n          On   May   10,   1999,   the    Committee    for    Public   Counsel\n\nServices (CPCS) -- a Massachusetts state defender service that\n\nprovides legal counsel to indigent defendants -- assigned counsel\n\nto Trapp's case.      Trapp's counsel requested that the SJC stay\n\nactivity in Trapp's case pending resolution of motions to be\n\nfiled in the trial court.      The SJC thus did not rule on Trapp's\n\nstill-pending gate-keeper motion.\n\n          On June 6, 2000, Trapp filed a motion in the state\n\ntrial court requesting funds to conduct additional tests on his\n\nbrain, including a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, a\n\nmore advanced imaging technique than the CAT scan available at\n\nthe time of Trapp's second trial.4 The state trial court denied\n\nthe   motion   and   the   subsequent     motion      for    reconsideration.\n\nEventually, Trapp's family secured funds for a PET scan, which\n\nwas performed on June 25, 2001.      The doctor who read the PET scan\n\nstated that it showed \"mildly decreased metabolism in the medial\n\naspects of the temporal lobes bilaterally,\" which was possibly\n\n\"related to memory impairment or . . . interictal seizure foci.\"\n\n          On October 5, 2001, Trapp filed in the state trial\n\ncourt a motion for a new trial based on the results of the PET\n\nscan, which he characterized as new evidence.                 The motion was\n\n      4\n          While a CAT scan reveals only the anatomical structure of\nthe brain, a PET scan apparently reveals brain functioning.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fdenied on June 27, 2002.         The motion judge found that Trapp had\n\nfailed   to    present   any   evidence    of   the   qualifications   of   the\n\ndoctor who had read the PET scan and had failed to present a\n\n\"qualified expert's opinion . . . that the PET scan results\n\nsupport[ed] the trial testimony of [Trapp]'s experts.\"             Moreover,\n\nhe found the results of the PET scan to be \"less than dramatic,\"\n\nquestioned whether the PET scan was \"probative of [Trapp's] brain\n\nfunction twenty years earlier,\" and found that even if it were,\n\nit was cumulative of other trial evidence.                 The motion judge\n\ndenied Trapp's motion for reconsideration, finding an additional\n\nphysician's affidavit submitted by Trapp to be \"too flimsy to\n\nprovide a basis to change [his earlier] ruling.\"\n\n              Trapp appealed to the SJC.        On April 27, 2004, a single\n\njustice of the SJC treated the appeal as an application for leave\n\nto appeal to the full court, which she denied.              The justice held\n\nthat \"[t]he results of the PET scan [were] not new evidence.\"\n\nShe stated that \"the PET scan indicate[d] the same abnormality\"\n\ntestified to at Trapp's second trial, and that \"the PET scan\n\nresults [were] merely cumulative.\"          She further noted the lack of\n\nevidence \"to establish that a PET scan conducted in 2001 [was]\n\nprobative of [Trapp]'s brain function twenty years earlier.\"                The\n\nSJC justice also denied Trapp's October 16, 1997 gate-keeper\n\nmotion on the ground that the SJC had already decided the issue.\n\nOn May 25, 2004, the single justice denied Trapp's motion for\n\n                                     -8-\n\freconsideration.    Trapp       did   not   petition    the     United    States\n\nSupreme Court for certiorari.\n\n          One year later, on May 25, 2005, Trapp filed a petition\n\nfor a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court\n\nfor the District of Massachusetts.\n\n          Respondent     Luis     Spencer,     Superintendent,           MCI   --\n\nNorfolk, moved the district court to dismiss the petition as time\n\nbarred.   See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1).           Trapp conceded that the\n\npetition was not timely filed because of an error on the part of\n\nhis counsel, but he requested that the district court equitably\n\ntoll the applicable limitations period and permit the petition.\n\nIn a careful, well-reasoned opinion, a United States Magistrate\n\nJudge recommended that Trapp's petition be dismissed.                 On October\n\n24, 2005, the district court adopted this recommendation and\n\ndismissed the petition as time barred.\n\n          On February 6, 2006, the district court granted Trapp a\n\ncertificate of appealability on the issue of whether the doctrine\n\nof equitable tolling should toll the one-year limitations period\n\nprovided for by 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1) in Trapp's case.\n\n                                      II.\n\n          We   review   the   district      court's    denial    of   equitable\n\ntolling for abuse of discretion.        Cordle v. Guarino, 428 F.3d 46,\n\n47 (1st Cir. 2005); Neverson v. Farquharson, 366 F.3d 32, 42 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fA.            Timeliness\n\n              We briefly explain why the petition is admittedly late\n\nin   order    to   assist   counsel   in   avoiding      late   filing.        AEDPA\n\nprovides for a one-year period of limitations during which \"a\n\nperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\" may\n\napply for federal habeas relief.             28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1).            For\n\npresent purposes, the limitations period began to run on \"the\n\ndate on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of\n\ndirect review or the expiration of the time for seeking such\n\nreview.\"      Id. § 2244(d)(1)(A).         When the Supreme Court denied\n\nTrapp's petition for certiorari on December 16, 1996, Trapp's\n\nconviction became final, and the AEDPA period of limitations\n\nbegan to run.        See Lawrence, 2007 WL 505972, at *2; Clay v.\n\nUnited States, 537 U.S. 522, 527 (2003) (stating that in the\n\ncontext of post-conviction relief, \"[f]inality attaches when [the\n\nSupreme]     Court   affirms    a   conviction     on    the   merits   on    direct\n\nreview or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari\").\n\n              Under 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2), the limitations period is\n\ntolled for the time during which \"a properly filed application\n\nfor State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect\n\nto   the     pertinent     judgment   or   claim    is    pending.\"          Section\n\n2244(d)(2) does not reset the clock on the limitations period,\n\nhowever, but merely stops it temporarily, until the relevant\n\napplications for review are ruled upon.                 Cordle, 428 F.3d at 48\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fn.4; Dunker v. Bissonnette, 154 F. Supp. 2d 95, 103 (D. Mass.\n\n2001) (\"Section 2244(d)(2) only stops, but does not reset, the\n\nclock from ticking . . . [and] cannot revive a time period that\n\nhas already expired.\"          (alteration and omission in original)\n\n(quoting Sorce v. Artuz, 73 F. Supp. 2d 292, 294 (E.D.N.Y. 1999))\n\n(internal   quotation    marks   omitted)).          Approximately      226   days\n\nelapsed between the denial of Trapp's petition for certiorari and\n\nhis filing of a new trial motion on July 31, 1997.                 Even assuming\n\nthat the limitations period was tolled for the entire period from\n\nJuly 31, 1997 until May 25, 2004, when the SJC ruled on Trapp's\n\ngate-keeper     petition,   Trapp's    petition      for   habeas    relief   was\n\nuntimely.    There is no dispute as to this fact.\n\nB.          Equitable Tolling\n\n            In Lawrence, the Supreme Court again side-stepped the\n\nquestion of whether equitable tolling ever applies to time limits\n\nfor the filing of federal habeas petitions by state prisoners,\n\nand simply assumed arguendo that equitable tolling is available.\n\n2007 WL 505972, at *6.         Lawrence did say several useful things\n\nabout the doctrine.\n\n            For example, the Lawrence Court refused to vary its\n\ninterpretation of AEDPA's statutory tolling provision in light of\n\n\"an exceedingly rare inequity that Congress almost certainly was\n\nnot   contemplating\"    when   enacting      the    limitations     period,    and\n\nstated   that   such   situations     \"may   well    be    cured   by   equitable\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\ftolling.\"       Id. at *5.       Next, the Court referred to the standards\n\nfor equitable tolling articulated in Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544\n\nU.S. 408, 418 (2005): a petitioner must show that he has been\n\npursuing       his    rights    diligently        and       that      some      extraordinary\n\ncircumstance         prevented       him     from    making           a    timely     filing.\n\nLawrence, 2007 WL 505972, at *6.                     Finally, Lawrence affirmed\n\nwithout dissent the circuit court's finding that the petitioner\n\nthere    had    not    otherwise       made    out      a      case       of    extraordinary\n\ncircumstances.          Id.    at    *6-7;    id.    at     *10    n.8         (Ginsburg,   J.,\n\ndissenting) (declining to reach the equitable tolling issue).\n\n               In another recent case, Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. ___,\n\nNo. 05-1240, 2007 WL 517122 (Feb. 21, 2007), the Supreme Court\n\nmade clear, albeit in               the context of a § 1983 action, that\n\n\"[e]quitable tolling is a rare remedy to be applied in unusual\n\ncircumstances, not a cure-all for an entirely common state of\n\naffairs.\"      Id. at *7.\n\n               In this circuit, we have allowed for equitable tolling\n\nof the § 2244(d)(1) limitations period in rare and extraordinary\n\ncases.    \"[T]he one-year limitations period in § 2244(d)(1) is not\n\njurisdictional        and,     accordingly,       can     be    subject         to   equitable\n\ntolling in appropriate cases.\"                Neverson, 366 F.3d at 41.                 Trapp\n\nbears the burden of establishing a basis for equitable tolling.\n\nId.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\f             In the habeas context in particular, courts must take\n\ncare   \"to    avoid      upsetting    the    'strong     concern     for    finality'\n\nembodied in [28 U.S.C.] § 2254.\"                  Id. at 42 (quoting Brackett v.\n\nUnited States, 270 F.3d 60, 67 (1st Cir. 2001)).                        Likewise, we\n\nare acutely aware that \"[o]ne of AEDPA's main purposes was to\n\ncompel habeas petitions to be filed promptly after conviction and\n\ndirect review.\"          David v. Hall, 318 F.3d 343, 346 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).      As a result, equitable tolling \"is the exception rather\n\nthan the rule; resort to its prophylaxis is deemed justified only\n\nin extraordinary circumstances.\" Donovan v. Maine, 276 F.3d 87,\n\n93   (1st    Cir.    2002)   (alteration          omitted)   (quoting      Delaney   v.\n\nMatesanz, 264 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir. 2001)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n             In     applying    the     equitable        tolling       doctrine,     an\n\nimportant factor is the reason for the late filing.                        Generally,\n\nin civil cases, \"garden-variety\" attorney negligence, even if\n\nexcusable, is not grounds for equitable tolling.                     Irwin v. Dep't\n\nof   Veterans'      Affairs,    498    U.S.       89,   96   (1990).       Rather,    a\n\npetitioner        must   demonstrate        the     existence   of     extraordinary\n\ncircumstances.        Pace, 544 U.S. at 418.\n\n             This circuit, along with many others, has held that\n\n\"mistake by counsel in reading [AEDPA] or computing the time\n\nlimit is, at most, a routine error\" and does not constitute\n\nextraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling.                      David,\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\f318 F.3d at 346; see also Miranda v. Castro, 292 F.3d 1063, 1066-\n\n68 (9th Cir. 2002); Smaldone v. Senkowski, 273 F.3d 133, 138-39\n\n(2d Cir. 2001); Helton v. Sec'y for the Dep't of Corr., 259 F.3d\n\n1310, 1313 (11th Cir. 2001) (per curiam); Kreutzer v. Bowersox,\n\n231 F.3d 460, 463 (8th Cir. 2000); Harris v. Hutchinson, 209 F.3d\n\n325, 330 (4th Cir. 2000); Taliani v. Chrans, 189 F.3d 597, 597-98\n\n(7th    Cir.       1999).       The     Supreme    Court    confirmed       as   much     in\n\nLawrence.          2007 WL 505972, at *6 (\"Attorney miscalculation is\n\nsimply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling, particularly\n\nin     the     postconviction           context     where     prisoners          have     no\n\nconstitutional right to counsel.\").\n\n               In David v. Hall, a case quite similar to the one\n\nbefore       us,    the     petitioner's       attorney     had    misunderstood        the\n\ncalculation        of     the   AEDPA    limitations      period    and    had    filed    a\n\nhabeas petition after the limitations period had expired.                               318\n\nF.3d at 344.         Like Trapp's attorney, the attorney in David filed\n\nan   affidavit       stating      that    he   could   have       filed    the   petition\n\nearlier but was under the impression that he was not required to\n\ndo so.       Id. at 345.         David rejected the argument that equitable\n\ntolling was warranted, stating, \"If carelessness were an escape\n\nhatch from statutes of limitations, they would hardly ever bar\n\nclaims.\"       Id. at 346.\n\n               This does not mean, however, that attorney error never\n\ncan be among the grounds for equitable tolling.                           Several of our\n\n\n                                            -14-\n\fsister circuits have, on specific facts, found an attorney's\n\nfailure to file a timely habeas petition so egregious as to\n\nwarrant equitable tolling of the AEDPA limitations period.5                 For\n\nexample, in Baldayaque v. United States, 338 F.3d 145 (2d Cir.\n\n2003), the Second Circuit found an attorney's failure to file a\n\nhabeas   petition      when   the   petitioner's     wife   had    hired    him\n\nspecifically to do so sufficient to warrant equitable tolling.\n\nId. at 152-53.         In Spitsyn v. Moore, 345 F.3d 796 (9th Cir.\n\n2003),   the   Ninth    Circuit     found   that    equitable     tolling   was\n\nappropriate when the petitioner's attorney ignored the statutory\n\ndeadline for filing a habeas petition and refused, after having\n\nbeen terminated, to provide the petitioner with his case file,\n\nthereby causing him to miss the deadline for filing a petition.\n\nId. at 798, 801.       Moreover, both the Eighth and Second Circuits\n\nhave found equitable tolling to be appropriate when an attorney\n\ndeceived the petitioner by informing him that a timely petition\n\nhad been filed when in fact it had not.            United States v. Martin,\n\n408 F.3d 1089, 1093-95 (8th Cir. 2005); United States v. Wynn,\n\n292 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir. 2002).\n\n           Likewise, some circuits have held that in particular\n\ncircumstances, otherwise unremarkable attorney error may warrant\n\nequitable tolling.      The Sixth Circuit, for example, has held that\n\n\n     5\n           We make no determination about the correctness of the\ndecisions that we describe here.      We include them merely as\nexemplars.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fif     the     law     defining      the     limitations        period     is     unclear,\n\n\"constitutional review should not be forfeited unless there has\n\nbeen       a   lack    of   good     faith    diligence        on    the   part      of    the\n\npetitioner.\"          Griffin v. Rogers, 399 F.3d 626, 636-38 (6th Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n                Similarly,     courts        may    be   more       willing     to        grant\n\nequitable tolling in death penalty cases, particularly when the\n\npetitioner has been diligent in pursuing his rights.6                           See, e.g.,\n\nFahy v. Horn, 240 F.3d 239, 244-45 (3d Cir. 2001); cf. Gardner v.\n\nFlorida, 430 U.S. 349, 357 (1977) (\"[D]eath is a different kind\n\nof   punishment        from    any    other    which     may    be    imposed      in     this\n\ncountry.\"); Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 305 (1976)\n\n(opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (\"[T]he penalty of\n\ndeath is qualitatively different from a sentence of imprisonment,\n\nhowever long.\").            But see Johnson v. McBride, 381 F.3d 587, 590-\n\n91 (7th Cir. 2004) (rejecting the view that a different test\n\napplies to capital cases); Rouse v. Lee, 339 F.3d 238, 253-56\n\n(4th Cir. 2003) (en banc) (same).                    Trapp was not sentenced to\n\ndeath.\n\n                We    delineate      here    some   of   those       factors      that      may\n\ninfluence a court's decision whether or not to grant equitable\n\n\n\n       6\n          Although Lawrence was a capital case, the question of\nwhether equitable tolling was warranted because Lawrence had been\nsentenced to death was not before the Court.    See Petition for\nCert. at ii-iii, Lawrence, 549 U.S. ___, 2006 WL 776784.\n\n                                             -16-\n\ftolling in a habeas case.7           Under Pace and our own precedent,\n\nrelevant factors include:\n\n1. The petitioner's own diligence in pursuing habeas relief, see,\n\ne.g., Pace, 544 U.S. at 419; Lattimore v. Dubois, 311 F.3d 46, 55\n\n(1st Cir. 2002);\n\n2.   Whether     some    extraordinary       circumstance     prevented      the\n\npetitioner from making a timely filing, see, e.g., Pace, 544 U.S.\n\nat 418; Neverson, 366 F.3d at 43;\n\n3.   The    petitioner's      diligence      in   the    pursuit     of     other\n\npost-conviction remedies and the process already afforded in the\n\nstate system, see, e.g., Pace, 544 U.S. at 418-19; Delaney, 264\n\nF.3d at 14-15;\n\n4.   Any   prejudice    to   the   prosecution    that   would     result    from\n\ntolling and possible retrial, see David, 318 F.3d at 347;\n\n5. The fact that equitable tolling is not available in cases of\n\ndubious    merit,8     see   Lattimore,     311   F.3d   at   55   (discussing\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits in determining that equitable\n\ntolling was not warranted); Brackett, 270 F.3d at 71 (same),\n\noverruled on other grounds by Johnson v. United States, 544 U.S.\n\n295, 302 (2005); and\n\n      7\n          Trapp has not made an \"actual innocence\" argument. In\nDavid, we cast a jaundiced eye on such arguments. See 318 F.3d at\n347.\n     8\n          There is language in Cordle rejecting a prisoner's\nattempt to use likelihood of success on the merits to excuse an\notherwise unjustified failure to meet the limitations period. 428\nF.3d at 49. This should not be inconsistent with our rule that\nequitable tolling is not available in cases of dubious merit.\n\n                                     -17-\n\f6. Whether or not the case is a capital case and whether or not\n\nthe petitioner has been sentenced to death, see David, 318 F.3d\n\nat 346 n.4.\n\n               The district court's conclusion, based on consideration\n\nof   the   totality      of   the   circumstances      (including        all   of    the\n\nfactors enumerated above), was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n               The magistrate judge appropriately considered not only\n\nthe reason for the late filing, but concluded that the defendant\n\nhimself    was    not    to   blame    and   had    been    diligent.      She      also\n\nconsidered        whether     the     entire       course     of     post-conviction\n\nproceedings had been diligently pursued, given that the state\n\nconviction became final with the denial of certiorari on December\n\n16, 1996, but the federal habeas petition was not brought until\n\nalmost     a    decade    later,      in   2005.       This     is   a   significant\n\nconsideration in light of the finality concerns that motivated\n\nCongress in enacting 28 U.S.C. § 2254.                See Pace, 544 U.S. at 419\n\n(\"Under        long-established       principles,       petitioner's       lack      of\n\ndiligence precludes equity's operation.\").                    The magistrate judge\n\nmade no error in concluding as a matter of fact that counsel had\n\nnot been particularly diligent in pursuing the state claims, or\n\nfor that matter, waiting until what counsel thought was the last\n\nday on which to file the federal habeas petition.                     The magistrate\n\njudge was careful to distinguish counsel's lack of diligence from\n\nTrapp's own diligence, at least as to preserving Trapp's federal\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\fhabeas claims.        Further, she recognized the special conditions --\n\norganic     brain    damage     --   under    which    Trapp       operated.        Those\n\nconditions were not, however, the cause of the late filing.                             See\n\nCalderon v. U.S. Dist. Court, 163 F.3d 530, 541 (9th Cir. 1998)\n\n(holding that a petitioner's mental incompetency can constitute\n\nextraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling if it\n\ninterferes with his ability to communicate with his attorney),\n\noverruled on other grounds by Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202,\n\n205-06 (2003).\n\n              The magistrate judge correctly considered as a factor\n\nthe   prejudice      the   state     would    suffer       if    it    were    forced    to\n\nrelitigate a murder case about events that had occurred twenty-\n\nfour years prior to the filing of the habeas petition.\n\n              The    magistrate      judge    also    correctly        considered       the\n\nconsiderable process that had already been afforded to Trapp in\n\nthe state system.          The issue of Trapp's criminal responsibility\n\nwas considered by the jury that convicted him, and the impact of\n\nthe   PET     scan    evidence       itself     on   the        validity      of   Trapp's\n\nconviction was considered and reconsidered by a motion judge and\n\na justice of the Supreme Judicial Court.                        The magistrate judge\n\nset   forth    the    reasons    the   state     courts     had       rejected     Trapp's\n\nclaims.\n\n              Finally, this was not a death penalty case in which\n\navoidance of error has a very high premium.\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f           We make one more comment lest Trapp spend the remainder\n\nof his years in state prison blaming his attorney for missing a\n\nfiling   deadline.       Trapp's         petition    had    a    low   likelihood     of\n\nsuccess.   The state courts carefully considered Trapp's claims on\n\ntheir merits.     As the single SJC justice who ruled on Trapp’s\n\ngate-keeper motion noted, Trapp's new evidence is consistent with\n\nevidence     presented      at    his     trial.          The    brain     abnormality\n\nsupposedly    shown    by    the        PET   scan   is    the    same     abnormality\n\nsupposedly shown by the CAT scan and to which experts testified\n\nat Trapp's trial.        At the time, the prosecution did present an\n\nalternative interpretation of Trapp's CAT scan, which may be\n\nundermined by the PET scan.               But the prosecution also presented\n\nevidence at trial that at the time of the killing, Trapp had\n\nacted rationally and shrewdly.                There was evidence that Trapp had\n\nrobbed the owner of the home where the killing occurred, had\n\nstolen the landlord's mother's car to flee the scene, and had\n\nlater abandoned the car.           Trapp I, 485 N.E.2d at 164.              There also\n\nwas evidence that Trapp had attempted to kidnap the landlord, who\n\nknew that Norton was dead, and had pursued the landlord when he\n\nhad   escaped,   but   had       then    fled    when   the     landlord    reached    a\n\nneighbor's home.       Id.       The jury that convicted Trapp considered\n\nthe issue of his brain abnormality and rejected the argument that\n\nit excused his behavior.            Moreover, it is not clear that a PET\n\n\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\fscan   performed   twenty   years    after   the   murder   reflects   the\n\ncondition of Trapp’s brain at the time of the crime.\n\n           Under these circumstances, the thoughtful analysis of\n\nthe district court and the magistrate judge was not an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    The dismissal of Trapp's petition for habeas corpus\n\nis affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\f",

Trapp</i> [<i>Trapp II</i>], 423 Mass. 356, 668 N.E.2d 327 (1996), affirming Trapp's conviction for murder and his life sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 8, 1981, Randall Trapp stabbed to death Lawrence Norton, a man he had met in a bar the night before. Following the stabbing, which occurred in Norton's home, Trapp stole Norton's landlord's money and the landlord's mother's car. <i>Trapp II,</i> 668 N.E.2d at 329; <i>Trapp I,</i> 485 N.E.2d at 164. In 1982, Trapp was tried before a jury in Massachusetts state court. At trial, he defended on the ground that he lacked criminal responsibility for his actions. <i>Trapp I,</i> 485 N.E.2d at 164. He presented expert testimony that the murder was the product of (1) an organic brain abnormality (caused by earlier head traumas, some of which were the result of beatings by his father) and (2) psychological stress attributable to his wife's \"deviant behavior,\" which included working as a prostitute and a stripper and being \"openly and promiscuously bisexual.\" <i>Id.</i> at 164 &amp; n. 2. Trapp was convicted of first-degree murder, armed robbery, and larceny of a motor vehicle, <i>id.</i> at 163, but the conviction was overturned on appeal because improper character evidence had been admitted at trial, <i>id.</i> at 165.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trapp was retried in 1987, and he again defended on the basis that he was not criminally responsible. <i>Trapp II,</i> 668 N.E.2d at 329. During the seven-day trial, seven experts, including three for the prosecution and four for the defense, testified on the issue of Trapp's criminal responsibility. <i>Id.</i> As part of their testimony, these experts offered their interpretations of a computed axial tomography (CAT) scan of Trapp's brain.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In particular, Trapp's primary medical expert, Dr. Vernon Mark, testified that the CAT scan showed an enlarged area in the \"right temporal horn\" where \"spinal fluid fill[ed] within the temporal lobe.\" Trapp's experts offered testimony as to the effects of such an abnormality, and testified that Trapp suffered from intermittent explosive disorder and organic personality disorder. By contrast, the Commonwealth's primary medical expert, Dr. Paul F. New, testified that Trapp's CAT scan did not show an enlarged temporal horn or any brain abnormality. The Commonwealth's additional experts offered testimony consistent with Dr. New's. Trapp also presented the testimony of lay witnesses, who described occasions prior to the homicide on which Trapp had behaved strangely. <i>Id.</i> After deliberating for two days, the jury convicted Trapp of first-degree murder based on extreme atrocity or cruelty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i> He was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trapp appealed his conviction on a number of grounds. He also moved in the state trial court for a new trial, claiming that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to present certain evidence at trial and because his presentation of other evidence was not persuasive. The motion for a new trial was denied, and Trapp's appeal therefrom was consolidated with his appeal from his conviction. On July 31, 1996, the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed Trapp's convictions. <i>Id.</i> at 333.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trapp then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which was denied on December 16, 1996. <i>See Trapp v. Massachusetts,</i> 519 U.S. 1045, 117 S.Ct. 618, 136 L.Ed.2d 542 (1996). As we explain below, it was at this point that the clock began to run on the one-year period for the filing of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, subject to statutory exclusions. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 31, 1997, Trapp filed in the state trial court a second motion for a new trial, based on the facts that he had been \"forced\" to stand trial in prison clothing, that the record had been \"deficient at the time of his direct appeal,\" and that the prosecution had used at trial results of a BEAM analysis that Trapp's counsel originally had ordered but had not intended to use and had not in fact used at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Trapp appended to his new trial motion a motion requesting court-appointed counsel. The motions were denied on September 7, 1997. On October 6, 1997, Trapp filed a gate-keeper motion requesting leave to appeal the denial of his motions for a new trial and for appointment of counsel to the SJC. As grounds for a new trial he reasserted his arguments that his constitutional rights had been violated when he was forced to stand trial in prison clothing and when the prosecution was permitted to discover and use the results of the BEAM analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 10, 1999, the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS)&#8212;a Massachusetts state defender service that provides legal counsel to indigent defendants&#8212;assigned counsel to Trapp's case. Trapp's counsel requested that the SJC stay activity in Trapp's case pending resolution of motions to be filed in the trial court. The SJC thus did not rule on Trapp's still-pending gate-keeper motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 6, 2000, Trapp filed a motion in the state trial court requesting funds to conduct additional tests on his brain, including a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, a more advanced imaging technique than the CAT scan available at the time of Trapp's second trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The state trial court denied the motion and the subsequent motion for reconsideration. Eventually, Trapp's family secured funds for a PET scan, which was performed on June 25, 2001. The doctor who read the PET scan stated that it showed \"mildly decreased metabolism in the medial aspects of the temporal lobes bilaterally,\" which was possibly \"related to memory impairment or ... interictal seizure foci.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 5, 2001, Trapp filed in the state trial court a motion for a new trial based on the results of the PET scan, which he characterized as new evidence. The motion was denied on June 27, 2002. The motion judge found that Trapp had failed to present any evidence of the qualifications of the doctor who had read the PET scan and had failed to present a \"qualified expert's opinion ... that the PET scan results support[ed] the trial testimony of [Trapp]'s experts.\" Moreover, he found the results of the PET scan to be \"less than dramatic,\" questioned whether the PET scan was \"probative of [Trapp's] brain function twenty years earlier,\" and found that even if it were, it was cumulative of other trial evidence. The motion judge denied Trapp's motion for reconsideration, finding an additional physician's affidavit submitted by Trapp to be \"too flimsy to provide a basis to change [his earlier] ruling.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trapp appealed to the SJC. On April 27, 2004, a single justice of the SJC treated the appeal as an application for leave to appeal to the full court, which she denied. The justice held that \"[t]he results of the PET scan [were] not new evidence.\" She stated that \"the PET scan indicate[d] the same abnormality\" testified to at Trapp's second trial, and that \"the PET scan results [were] merely cumulative.\" She further noted the lack of evidence \"to establish that a PET scan conducted in 2001[was] probative of [Trapp]'s brain function twenty years earlier.\" The SJC justice also denied Trapp's October 16, 1997 gate-keeper motion on the ground that the SJC had already decided the issue. On May 25, 2004, the single justice denied Trapp's motion for reconsideration. Trapp did not petition the United States Supreme Court for certiorari.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One year later, on May 25, 2005, Trapp filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent Luis Spencer, Superintendent, MCI&#8212;Norfolk, moved the district court to dismiss the petition as time barred. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1). Trapp conceded that the petition was not timely filed because of an error on the part of his counsel, but he requested that the district court equitably toll the applicable limitations period and permit the petition. In a careful, well-reasoned opinion, a United States Magistrate Judge recommended that Trapp's petition be dismissed. On October 24, 2005, the district court adopted this recommendation and dismissed the petition as time barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 6, 2006, the district court granted Trapp a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether the doctrine of equitable tolling should toll the one-year limitations period provided for by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1) in Trapp's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's denial of equitable tolling for abuse of discretion. <i>Cordle v. Guarino,</i> 428 F.3d 46, 47 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Neverson v. Farquharson,</i> 366 F.3d 32, 42 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Timeliness</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly explain why the petition is admittedly late in order to assist counsel in avoiding late filing. AEDPA provides for a one-year period of limitations during which \"a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\" may apply for federal habeas relief. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1). For present purposes, the limitations period began to run on \"the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2244(d)(1)(A). When the Supreme Court denied Trapp's petition for certiorari on December 16, 1996, Trapp's conviction became final, and the AEDPA period of limitations began to run. <i>See Lawrence,</i> ___ U.S. at ___, 127 S.Ct. 1079; <i>Clay v. United States,</i> 537 U.S. 522, 527, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003) (stating that in the context of post-conviction relief, \"[f]inality attaches when [the Supreme] Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(2), the limitations period is tolled for the time during which \"a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\" Section 2244(d)(2) does not reset the clock on the limitations period, however, but merely stops it temporarily, until the relevant applications for review are ruled upon. <i>Cordle,</i> 428 F.3d at 48 n. 4; <i>Dunker v. Bissonnette,</i> 154 F.Supp.2d 95, 103 (D.Mass.2001) (\"Section 2244(d)(2) only stops, but does not reset, the clock from ticking ... [and] cannot revive a time period that has already expired.\" (alteration and omission in original) (quoting <i>Sorce v. Artuz,</i> 73 F.Supp.2d 292, 294 (E.D.N.Y.1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Approximately 226 days elapsed between the denial of Trapp's petition for certiorari and his filing of a new trial motion on July 31, 1997. Even assuming that the limitations period was tolled for the entire period from July 31, 1997 until May 25, 2004, when the SJC ruled on Trapp's gate-keeper petition, Trapp's petition for habeas relief was untimely. There is no dispute as to this fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Equitable Tolling</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Lawrence,</i> the Supreme Court again side-stepped the question of whether equitable tolling ever applies to time limits for the filing of federal habeas petitions by state prisoners, and simply assumed arguendo that equitable tolling is available. ___ U.S. at ___, 127 S.Ct. 1079. <i>Lawrence</i> did say several useful things about the doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, the <i>Lawrence</i> Court refused to vary its interpretation of AEDPA's statutory tolling provision in light of \"an exceedingly rare inequity that Congress almost certainly was not contemplating\" when enacting the limitations period, and stated that such situations \"may well be cured by equitable tolling.\" <i>Id.</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. 1079. Next, the Court referred to the standards for equitable tolling articulated in <i>Pace v. DiGuglielmo,</i> 544 U.S. 408, 418, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005): a petitioner must show that he has been pursuing his rights diligently and that some extraordinary circumstance prevented him from making a timely filing. <i>Lawrence,</i> ___ U.S. at ___, 127 S.Ct. 1079. Finally, <i>Lawrence</i> affirmed without dissent the circuit court's finding that the petitioner there had not otherwise made out a case of extraordinary circumstances. <i>Id.</i> at ___-___, 127 S.Ct. 1079; <i>id.</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. 1079 n. 8 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (declining to reach the equitable tolling issue).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In another recent case, <i>Wallace v. Kato,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1091, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2007), the Supreme Court made clear, albeit in the context of a &#167; 1983 action, that \"[e]quitable tolling is a rare remedy to be applied in unusual circumstances, not a cure-all for an entirely common state of affairs.\" <i>Id.</i> at ___, 127 S.Ct. 1091.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this circuit, we have allowed for equitable tolling of the &#167; 2244(d)(1) limitations period in rare and extraordinary cases. \"[T]he one-year limitations period in &#167; 2244(d)(1) is not jurisdictional and, accordingly, can be subject to equitable tolling in appropriate cases.\" <i>Neverson,</i> 366 F.3d at 41. Trapp bears the burden of establishing a basis for equitable tolling. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the habeas context in particular, courts must take care \"to avoid upsetting the `strong concern for finality' embodied in [28 U.S.C.] &#167; 2254.\" <i>Id.</i> at 42 (quoting <i>Brackett v. United States,</i> 270 F.3d 60, 67 (1st Cir.2001)). Likewise, we are acutely aware that \"[o]ne of AEDPA's main purposes was to compel habeas petitions to be filed promptly after conviction and direct review.\" <i>David v. Hall,</i> 318 F.3d 343, 346 (1st Cir.2003). As a result, equitable tolling \"is the exception rather than the rule; resort to its prophylaxis is deemed justified only in extraordinary circumstances.\" <i>Donovan v. Maine,</i> 276 F.3d 87, 93 (1st Cir.2002) (alteration omitted) (quoting <i>Delaney</i> <i>v. Matesanz,</i> 264 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir.2001)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In applying the equitable tolling doctrine, an important factor is the reason for the late filing. Generally, in civil cases, \"garden-variety\" attorney negligence, even if excusable, is not grounds for equitable tolling. <i>Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans' Affairs,</i> 498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990). Rather, a petitioner must demonstrate the existence of extraordinary circumstances. <i>Pace,</i> 544 U.S. at 418, 125 S.Ct. 1807.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit, along with many others, has held that \"mistake by counsel in reading [AEDPA] or computing the time limit is, at most, a routine error\" and does not constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling. <i>David,</i> 318 F.3d at 346; <i>see also Miranda v. Castro,</i> 292 F.3d 1063, 1066-68 (9th Cir.2002); <i>Smaldone v. Senkowski,</i> 273 F.3d 133, 138-39 (2d Cir.2001); <i>Helton v. Sec'y for the Dep't of Corr.,</i> 259 F.3d 1310, 1313 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam); <i>Kreutzer v. Bowersox,</i> 231 F.3d 460, 463 (8th Cir.2000); <i>Harris v. Hutchinson,</i> 209 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir.2000); <i>Taliani v. Chrans,</i> 189 F.3d 597, 597-98 (7th Cir.1999). The Supreme Court confirmed as much in <i>Lawrence.</i> ___ U.S. at ___, 127 S.Ct. 1079 (\"Attorney miscalculation is simply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling, particularly in the postconviction context where prisoners have no constitutional right to counsel.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>David v. Hall,</i> a case quite similar to the one before us, the petitioner's attorney had misunderstood the calculation of the AEDPA limitations period and had filed a habeas petition after the limitations period had expired. 318 F.3d at 344. Like Trapp's attorney, the attorney in <i>David</i> filed an affidavit stating that he could have filed the petition earlier but was under the impression that he was not required to do so. <i>Id.</i> at 345. <i>David</i> rejected the argument that equitable tolling was warranted, stating, \"If carelessness were an escape hatch from statutes of limitations, they would hardly ever bar claims.\" <i>Id.</i> at 346.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean, however, that attorney error never can be among the grounds for equitable tolling. Several of our sister circuits have, on specific facts, found an attorney's failure to file a timely habeas petition so egregious as to warrant equitable tolling of the AEDPA limitations period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> For example, in <i>Baldayaque v. United States,</i> 338 F.3d 145 (2d Cir.2003), the Second Circuit found an attorney's failure to file a habeas petition when the petitioner's wife had hired him specifically to do so sufficient to warrant equitable tolling. <i>Id.</i> at 152-53. In <i>Spitsyn v. Moore,</i> 345 F.3d 796 (9th Cir.2003), the Ninth Circuit found that equitable tolling was appropriate when the petitioner's attorney ignored the statutory deadline for filing a habeas petition and refused, after having been terminated, to provide the petitioner with his case file, thereby causing him to miss the deadline for filing a petition. <i>Id.</i> at 798, 801. Moreover, both the Eighth and Second Circuits have found equitable tolling to be appropriate when an attorney deceived the petitioner by informing him that a timely petition had been filed when in fact it had not. <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 408 F.3d 1089, 1093-95 (8th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Wynn,</i> 292 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, some circuits have held that in particular circumstances, otherwise unremarkable attorney error may warrant equitable tolling. The Sixth Circuit, for example, has held that if the law defining the limitations period is unclear, \"constitutional review should not be forfeited unless there has been a lack of good faith diligence on the part of the petitioner.\" <i>Griffin v. Rogers,</i> 399 F.3d 626, 636-38 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, courts may be more willing to grant equitable tolling in death penalty cases, particularly when the petitioner has been diligent in pursuing his rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See, e.g., Fahy v. Horn,</i> 240 F.3d 239, 244-45 (3d Cir.2001); <i>cf. Gardner v. Florida,</i> 430 U.S. 349, 357, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (1977) (\"[D]eath is a different kind of punishment from any other which may be imposed in this country.\"); <i>Woodson v.

She also considered whether the entire course of post-conviction proceedings had been diligently pursued, given that the state conviction became final with the denial of certiorari on December 16, 1996, but the federal habeas petition was not brought until almost a decade later, in 2005. This is a significant consideration in light of the finality concerns that motivated Congress in enacting 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254. <i>See Pace,</i> 544 U.S. at 419, 125 S.Ct. 1807 (\"Under long-established principles, petitioner's lack of diligence precludes equity's operation.\"). The magistrate judge made no error in concluding as a matter of fact that counsel had not been particularly diligent in pursuing the state claims, or for that matter, waiting until what counsel thought was the last day on which to file the federal habeas petition. The magistrate judge was careful to distinguish counsel's lack of diligence from Trapp's own diligence, at least as to preserving Trapp's federal habeas claims. Further, she recognized the special conditions &#8212; organic brain damage &#8212; under which Trapp operated. Those conditions were not, however, the cause of the late filing. <i>See Calderon v. U.S. Dist. Court,</i> 163 F.3d 530, 541 (9th Cir.1998) (holding that a petitioner's mental incompetency can constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling if it interferes with his ability to communicate with his attorney), <i>overruled on other grounds by Woodford v. Garceau,</i> 538 U.S. 202, 205-06, 123 S.Ct. 1398, 155 L.Ed.2d 363 (2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge correctly considered as a factor the prejudice the state would suffer if it were forced to relitigate a murder case about events that had occurred twenty-four years prior to the filing of the habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge also correctly considered the considerable process that had already been afforded to Trapp in the state system. The issue of Trapp's criminal responsibility was considered by the jury that convicted him, and the impact of the PET scan evidence itself on the validity of Trapp's conviction was considered and reconsidered by a motion judge and a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court. The magistrate judge set forth the reasons the state courts had rejected Trapp's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, this was not a death penalty case in which avoidance of error has a very high premium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We make one more comment lest Trapp spend the remainder of his years in state prison blaming his attorney for missing a filing deadline. Trapp's petition had a low likelihood of success. The state courts carefully considered Trapp's claims on their merits. As the single SJC justice who ruled on Trapp's gate-keeper motion noted, Trapp's new evidence is consistent with evidence presented at his trial. The brain abnormality supposedly shown by the PET scan is the same abnormality supposedly shown by the CAT scan and to which experts testified at Trapp's trial. At the time, the prosecution did present an alternative interpretation of Trapp's CAT scan, which may be undermined by the PET scan. But the prosecution also presented evidence at trial that at the time of the killing, Trapp had acted rationally and shrewdly. There was evidence that Trapp had robbed the owner of the home where the killing occurred, had stolen the landlord's mother's car to flee the scene, and had later abandoned the car. <i>Trapp I,</i> 485 N.E.2d at 164. There also was evidence that Trapp had attempted to kidnap the landlord, who knew that Norton was dead, and had pursued the landlord when he had escaped, but had then fled when the landlord reached a neighbor's home. <i>Id.</i> The jury that convicted Trapp considered the issue of his brain abnormality and rejected the argument that it excused his behavior. Moreover, it is not clear that a PET scan performed twenty years after the murder reflects the condition of Trapp's brain at the time of the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, the thoughtful analysis of the district court and the magistrate judge was not an abuse of discretion.

Following the stabbing, which occurred in Norton's home, Trapp stole Norton's landlord's money and the landlord's mother's car. <i>Trapp II,</i> 668 N.E.2d at 329; <i>Trapp I,</i> 485 N.E.2d at 164. In 1982, Trapp was tried before a jury in Massachusetts state court. At trial, he defended on the ground that he lacked criminal responsibility for his actions. <i>Trapp I,</i> 485 N.E.2d at 164. He presented expert testimony that the murder was the product of (1) an organic brain abnormality (caused by earlier head traumas, some of which were the result of beatings by his father) and (2) psychological stress attributable to his wife's \"deviant behavior,\" which included working as a prostitute and a stripper and being \"openly and promiscuously bisexual.\" <i>Id.</i> at 164 &amp; n. 2. Trapp was convicted of first-degree murder, armed robbery, and larceny of a motor vehicle, <i>id.</i> at 163, but the conviction was overturned on appeal because improper character evidence had been admitted at trial, <i>id.</i> at 165.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trapp was retried in 1987, and he again defended on the basis that he was not criminally responsible. <i>Trapp II,</i> 668 N.E.2d at 329. During the seven-day trial, seven experts, including three for the prosecution and four for the defense, testified on the issue of Trapp's criminal responsibility. <i>Id.</i> As part of their testimony, these experts offered their interpretations of a computed axial tomography (CAT) scan of Trapp's brain.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In particular, Trapp's primary medical expert, Dr. Vernon Mark, testified that the CAT scan showed an enlarged area in the \"right temporal horn\" where \"spinal fluid fill[ed] within the temporal lobe.\" Trapp's experts offered testimony as to the effects of such an abnormality, and testified that Trapp suffered from intermittent explosive disorder and organic personality disorder. By contrast, the Commonwealth's primary medical expert, Dr. Paul F. New, testified that Trapp's CAT scan did not show an enlarged temporal horn or any brain abnormality. The Commonwealth's additional experts offered testimony consistent with Dr. New's. Trapp also presented the testimony of lay witnesses, who described occasions prior to the homicide on which Trapp had behaved strangely. <i>Id.</i> After deliberating for two days, the jury convicted Trapp of first-degree murder based on extreme atrocity or cruelty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i> He was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trapp appealed his conviction on a number of grounds. He also moved in the state trial court for a new trial, claiming that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to present certain evidence at trial and because his presentation of other evidence was not persuasive. The motion for a new trial was denied, and Trapp's appeal therefrom was consolidated with his appeal from his conviction. On July 31, 1996, the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed Trapp's convictions. <i>Id.</i> at 333.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trapp then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which was denied on December 16, 1996. <i>See Trapp v.

The motions were denied on September 7, 1997. On October 6, 1997, Trapp filed a gate-keeper motion requesting leave to appeal the denial of his motions for a new trial and for appointment of counsel to the SJC.

Eventually, Trapp's family secured funds for a PET scan, which was performed on June 25, 2001. The doctor who read the PET scan stated that it showed \"mildly decreased metabolism in the medial aspects of the temporal lobes bilaterally,\" which was possibly \"related to memory impairment or ... interictal seizure foci.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 5, 2001, Trapp filed in the state trial court a motion for a new trial based on the results of the PET scan, which he characterized as new evidence. The motion was denied on June 27, 2002. The motion judge found that Trapp had failed to present any evidence of the qualifications of the doctor who had read the PET scan and had failed to present a \"qualified expert's opinion ... that the PET scan results support[ed] the trial testimony of [Trapp]'s experts.\" Moreover, he found the results of the PET scan to be \"less than dramatic,\" questioned whether the PET scan was \"probative of [Trapp's] brain function twenty years earlier,\" and found that even if it were, it was cumulative of other trial evidence.

The justice held that \"[t]he results of the PET scan [were] not new evidence.\" She stated that \"the PET scan indicate[d] the same abnormality\" testified to at Trapp's second trial, and that \"the PET scan results [were] merely cumulative.\" She further noted the lack of evidence \"to establish that a PET scan conducted in 2001[was] probative of [Trapp]'s brain function twenty years earlier.\" The SJC justice also denied Trapp's October 16, 1997 gate-keeper motion on the ground that the SJC had already decided the issue.

Whether or not the case is a capital case and whether or not the petitioner has been sentenced to death, <i>see David,</i> 318 F.3d at 346 n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's conclusion, based on consideration of the totality of the circumstances (including all of the factors enumerated above), was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge appropriately considered not only the reason for the late filing, but concluded that the defendant himself was not to blame and had been diligent. She also considered whether the entire course of post-conviction proceedings had been diligently pursued, given that the state conviction became final with the denial of certiorari on December 16, 1996, but the federal habeas petition was not brought until almost a decade later, in 2005. This is a significant consideration in light of the finality concerns that motivated Congress in enacting 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254. <i>See Pace,</i> 544 U.S. at 419, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142891\"><a href=\"/opinion/142891/pace-v-diguglielmo/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1807</span></a></span> (\"Under long-established principles, petitioner's lack of diligence precludes equity's operation.\"). The magistrate judge made no error in concluding as a matter of fact that counsel had not been particularly diligent in pursuing the state claims, or for that matter, waiting until what counsel thought was the last day on which to file the federal habeas petition. The magistrate judge was careful to distinguish counsel's lack of diligence from Trapp's own diligence, at least as to preserving Trapp's federal habeas claims. Further, she recognized the special conditions &#8212; organic brain damage &#8212; under which Trapp operated. Those conditions were not, however, the cause of the late filing. <i>See Calderon v. U.S. Dist. Court,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760166\"><a href=\"/opinion/760166/98-cal-daily-op-serv-8959-98-daily-journal-dar-12479-arthur/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">530</span></a></span>, 541 (9th Cir.1998) (holding that a petitioner's mental incompetency can constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling if it interferes with his ability to communicate with his attorney), <i>overruled on other grounds by Woodford v.

The issue of Trapp's criminal responsibility was considered by the jury that convicted him, and the impact of the PET scan evidence itself on the validity of Trapp's conviction was considered and reconsidered by a motion judge and a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court. The magistrate judge set forth the reasons the state courts had rejected Trapp's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, this was not a death penalty case in which avoidance of error has a very high premium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We make one more comment lest Trapp spend the remainder of his years in state prison blaming his attorney for missing a filing deadline. Trapp's petition had a low likelihood of success. The state courts carefully considered Trapp's claims on their merits. As the single SJC justice who ruled on Trapp's gate-keeper motion noted, Trapp's new evidence is consistent with evidence presented at his trial. The brain abnormality supposedly shown by the PET scan is the same abnormality supposedly shown by the CAT scan and to which experts testified at Trapp's trial. At the time, the prosecution did present an alternative interpretation of Trapp's CAT scan, which may be undermined by the PET scan. But the prosecution also presented evidence at trial that at the time of the killing, Trapp had acted rationally and shrewdly. There was evidence that Trapp had robbed the owner of the home where the killing occurred, had stolen the landlord's mother's car to flee the scene, and had later abandoned the car. <i>Trapp I,</i> 485 N.E.2d at 164. There also was evidence that Trapp had attempted to kidnap the landlord, who knew that Norton was dead, and had pursued the landlord when he had escaped, but had then fled when the landlord reached a neighbor's home. <i>Id.</i> The jury that convicted Trapp considered the issue of his brain abnormality and rejected the argument that it excused his behavior. Moreover, it is not clear that a PET scan performed twenty years after the murder reflects the condition of Trapp's brain at the time of the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, the thoughtful analysis of the district court and the magistrate judge was not an abuse of discretion.
