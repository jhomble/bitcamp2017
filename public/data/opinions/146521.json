Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United states, sitting by designation.\n\f           STAHL, Circuit Judge.    Plaintiff-appellant Joseph Braga,\n\na former inmate at the Bristol County House of Correction in\n\nDartmouth, Massachusetts, brought suit against defendant-appellee\n\nThomas Hodgson, Sheriff of Bristol County, Massachusetts.1             Braga\n\nalleged that the Sheriff's negligent maintenance of the facility\n\ncaused him physical injuries (the \"negligence claim\") and that the\n\nSheriff intentionally or with deliberate indifference denied Braga\n\nproper medical care, in violation of            42 U.S.C. § 1983 (the\n\n\"Section   1983   claim\").   After       considering   written   and   oral\n\nargument, the district court granted summary judgment in the\n\nSheriff's favor on both counts.          Having carefully reviewed the\n\nrecord, we affirm.    Braga also appeals the district court's entry\n\nof a protective order preventing Braga from deposing the Sheriff.\n\nWe affirm that decision as well.\n\n           We first address the protective order issue, because\n\nBraga argues that his ability to create an adequate record to\n\nsurvive summary judgment was undermined by not being permitted to\n\ndepose the Sheriff.     Braga asserts that he made six attempts to\n\nschedule a deposition of the Sheriff over the course of a year, all\n\n\n\n     1\n      Braga also named Prison Health Services, Inc. (\"PHS\") as a\ndefendant in his amended complaint. The district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of PHS on one count (a claim under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983), but denied summary judgment as to a second claim\nagainst PHS (negligent provision of medical care regarding surgical\nrepair of his knee).      Braga and PHS apparently settled the\nnegligence claim without proceeding to trial.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fof which were rebuffed due to scheduling conflicts.            Only after\n\nthese six attempts did the Sheriff move for a protective order.\n\n           Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) a party may seek a protective\n\norder to prevent or limit discovery in order to avoid \"annoyance,\n\nembarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.\"          While we\n\ngenerally favor broad pretrial discovery, it is also true that the\n\n\"trial judge has broad discretion in ruling on pre-trial management\n\nmatters, and we review the district court's denial of discovery for\n\nabuse of its considerable discretion.\"           Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol\n\nMyers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n           The    district   court's    oral     decision   granting   the\n\nprotective order rested on a determination that, with all other\n\ndiscovery completed, Braga had failed to put forth any evidence\n\nwhatsoever that (1) the Sheriff had any personal knowledge of\n\nBraga's health care or (2) there was any basis for a Monell claim2\n\nthat there was a policy or practice of denying health care to\n\ninmates.    The   court   therefore    granted    the   protective   order,\n\nconcluding that Braga's request to depose the Sheriff did not\n\nconform to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which requires that \"the\n\ndiscovery appear[] reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery\n\nof admissible evidence.\"\n\n\n\n     2\n      See Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694-95\n(1978) (permitting Section 1983 suits against municipalities and\nother local governments for a policy or custom that violates an\nindividual's constitutional rights).\n\n                                  -3-\n\f          Having reviewed the summary judgment record, we agree\n\nwith the district court's conclusion that Braga put forth no\n\nevidence or plausible argument suggesting that a deposition of\n\nHodgson was reasonably calculated to lead to other discoverable\n\nmaterials regarding his claims against the Sheriff. See Heidelberg\n\nAmericas, Inc. v. Tokyo Kikai Seisakusho, Ltd., 333 F.3d 38, 41-42\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).   Neither at the motion hearing nor in his papers\n\nto the district court or this court has Braga plausibly suggested\n\nthat the Sheriff had any personal knowledge of Braga's medical care\n\nor that there was any policy or practice of denial of health care.\n\nAs such, the request to depose was not reasonably calculated to\n\nyield discoverable materials and was instead closer to a fishing\n\nexpedition.3   See, e.g., Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd., 83\n\nF.3d 526, 533-34 (1st Cir. 1996).      Thus, finding no abuse of\n\ndiscretion, we affirm the grant of the protective order.4\n\n          Braga also appeals from the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment as to the negligence and Section 1983 claims.   We\n\n\n     3\n      This conclusion is based on the paucity of evidence put forth\nby Braga in support of his claims against the Sheriff. We thus\naffirm the district court's grant of a protective order without\nreaching the issue pressed by the Sheriff on appeal, namely that\nhis status as a high-ranking public official provides an\nalternative ground to affirm the protective order grant.          A\nresolution of this issue is not necessary here.\n     4\n      In its oral decision on the protective order, the district\ncourt rightly acknowledged that deciding that issue required the\ncourt to consider, at least preliminarily, the viability on the\nmerits of Braga's claims against the Sheriff.    Indeed, the two\nissues are closely intertwined for our purposes as well.\n\n                                -4-\n\freview both decisions de novo, Singh v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of\n\nMass., Inc., 308 F.3d 25, 31 (1st Cir. 2002), and will affirm if\n\nthere is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and if the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\" Anderson\n\nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986). Importantly, the\n\nnonmoving party \"may not rest upon mere allegation . . . but must\n\nset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for\n\ntrial.\"    Id. at 256.    Employing these standards, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's entry of summary judgment for the following\n\nreasons.\n\n           First,   the   negligence    claim   was   properly   dismissed\n\nbecause Braga failed to comply with the presentment requirement of\n\nMassachusetts General Law 258, Section 4 (the Massachusetts Tort\n\nClaims Act), which obliges a claimant to first present a negligence\n\nclaim against a public employer to the executive officer of the\n\npublic employer.    See Weaver v. Commonwealth, 438 N.E.2d 831, 833-\n\n36 (Mass. 1982).    Braga stipulated before the district court that\n\nhe made no such presentment and he offers no compelling argument on\n\nappeal that we should ignore the rule that presentment should be\n\nmade \"in strict compliance with the statute.\"         Id. at 834, 47.   We\n\ntherefore affirm the grant of summary judgment as to the negligence\n\nclaim.5\n\n\n     5\n      We also note that, beyond the presentment problem, Braga's\nown deposition fatally undermined his negligence claim. He alleged\nin his complaint that the Sheriff failed to maintain the jail in a\n\n                                  -5-\n\f              Second, the district court also properly granted summary\n\njudgment as to Braga's Section 1983 claim against the Sheriff in\n\nhis individual and official capacities.       As to Braga's individual\n\ncapacity claim, the summary judgment record showed absolutely no\n\nevidence of the Sheriff's personal involvement with or knowledge of\n\nBraga's medical care.6      See Rogan v. Menino, 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (\"It is axiomatic that the liability of persons sued in\n\ntheir individual capacities under section 1983 must be gauged in\n\nterms of their own actions.\").      Therefore, this claim has no merit\n\nand summary judgment was warranted.\n\n              As to the Sheriff's actions in his official capacity, the\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment because it found that there\n\nwas not sufficient evidentiary support to sustain Braga's claim of\n\nan   Eighth    Amendment   violation.    Having   reviewed   the   summary\n\njudgment record, we agree.\n\n\nreasonably safe manner, which in turn caused an injury to his knee.\nYet Braga was unable, at deposition, to identify the cause of the\nknee injury or what area of the jail had been negligently\nmaintained. When asked how his knee was injured he replied, \"I do\nnot know.\" He went on to answer similar questions with \"I don't\nknow,\" \"I don't remember,\" and \"I just don't remember what [the\ncause of the injury] was.\" Plainly, then, there was no factual\nbasis for his claim of negligence.\n      6\n      On appeal, Braga attempts to create a question of material\nfact on this issue by pointing to his post-deposition affidavit\nwherein he, Braga, alleged that he sent several letters to the\nSheriff complaining of his medical treatment while he was\nincarcerated. However, the district court granted the Sheriff's\nmotion to strike that affidavit and Braga did not appeal from that\ngrant. Therefore the affidavit is not part of the record before\nus.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f           Where a prisoner claims that his Eighth Amendment rights\n\nwere violated by denial of access to proper medical care, \"he must\n\nprove   that   the   defendants'   actions    amounted   to    'deliberate\n\nindifference to a serious medical need.'\" DesRosiers v. Moran, 949\n\nF.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S.\n\n97, 106 (1976)).       \"Moreover, inadvertent failures to provide\n\nmedical care, even if negligent, do not sink to the level of\n\ndeliberate     indifference.    In    order   to   establish   deliberate\n\nindifference, the complainant must prove that the defendants had a\n\nculpable state of mind and intended wantonly to inflict pain.\" Id.\n\nat 19 (citations omitted).\n\n           Braga's allegations of harm inflicted by prison officials\n\ncome nowhere near the level of deliberate indifference required.\n\nBraga cites four incidents which he says were sufficient to permit\n\nhis claim against the Sheriff to survive summary judgement. Two of\n\nthese claims (that a prison doctor refused to provide answers over\n\nthe phone to a hospital emergency room doctor regarding Braga's\n\nheart medication, and that a prison doctor threatened Braga with\n\nsolitary confinement if he kept submitting sick slips complaining\n\nof health problems) only involve allegations of wrong-doing by\n\ndoctors employed by Prison Health Services, Inc., rather than\n\ncorrections officials. Without more, they therefore do not support\n\nan Eighth Amendment claim against the Sheriff.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f          Braga's   other   two    allegations   implicate   corrections\n\nofficials. First, he alleges that on one occasion corrections\n\nofficers removed him from the medical unit before he received his\n\ndaily medication in order to comply with the guard schedule.\n\nHowever, he does not allege that he suffered any ill effect from\n\nthis medication delay.\n\n          Second, he alleges that officers removed him from a\n\nhospital before he had a heart ventricle unblocked, contrary to\n\ndoctor's orders.    However, the medical report in the record shows\n\nthat he was discharged by the hospital after undergoing a cardiac\n\ncatheterization that ruled out a heart attack and confirmed \"mild\n\nto moderate disease involving the [left anterior descending artery]\n\nwith normal left ventricular function.\"      The recommended treatment\n\nwas \"ongoing medical therapy . . . for risk factor modification\"\n\nand use of a \"lipid-lowering agent.\" In other words, his discharge\n\nappears consistent with the medical recommendation of the hospital\n\nphysicians.   Further, at his own deposition, Braga admitted that\n\nthe hospital doctors \"said [the heart problem] would eventually\n\nneed to be taken care of.          And when I asked if it was life-\n\nthreatening, they said no.\"       We therefore agree with the district\n\ncourt that Braga failed to put forth any evidence at all to support\n\nhis theory of deliberate indifference to his medical care.7\n\n\n     7\n      We need not reach an additional, obvious infirmity with\nBraga's Section 1983 claim, namely that he cannot connect his\nallegedly poor medical treatment to any action or inaction of the\n\n                                    -8-\n\f          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of a protective order and entry of summary judgment.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nSheriff or to any policy or practice of the county.\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

After considering written and oral argument, the district court granted summary judgment in the Sheriff's favor on both counts. Having carefully reviewed the record, we affirm.

We affirm that decision as well.</p>\n<p>We first address the protective order issue, because Braga argues that his ability to create an adequate record to survive summary judgment was undermined by not being permitted to depose the Sheriff.

Thus, finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm the grant of the protective order.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Braga also appeals from the district court's grant of summary judgment as to the negligence and Section 1983 claims. We review both decisions de novo, <i>Singh v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Mass., Inc.,</i> 308 F.3d 25, 31 (1st Cir.2002), and will affirm if there is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\" <i>Anderson v.

Therefore, this claim has no merit and summary judgment was warranted.</p>\n<p>As to the Sheriff's actions in his official capacity, the district court granted summary judgment because it found that there was not sufficient evidentiary support to sustain Braga's claim of an Eighth Amendment violation. Having reviewed the summary judgment record, we agree.</p>\n<p>Where a prisoner claims that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated by denial of access to proper medical care, \"he must prove that the defendants' actions amounted to `deliberate indifference to a serious medical need.'\" <i>DesRosiers v.

Without more, they therefore do not support an Eighth Amendment claim against the Sheriff.</p>\n<p>Braga's other two allegations implicate corrections officials. First, he alleges that on one occasion corrections officers removed him from the medical unit before he received his daily medication in order to comply with the guard schedule. However, he does not allege that he suffered any ill effect from this medication delay.</p>\n<p>Second, he alleges that officers removed him from a hospital before he had a heart ventricle unblocked, contrary to doctor's orders.

David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United states, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Braga also named Prison Health Services, Inc. (\"PHS\") as a defendant in his amended complaint.

When asked how his knee was injured he replied, \"I do not know.\" He went on to answer similar questions with \"I don't know,\" \"I don't remember,\" and \"I just don't remember what [the cause of the injury] was.\" Plainly, then, there was no factual basis for his claim of negligence.</p>\n<p>[6]  On appeal, Braga attempts to create a question of material fact on this issue by pointing to his post-deposition affidavit wherein he, Braga, alleged that he sent several letters to the Sheriff complaining of his medical treatment while he was incarcerated. However, the district court granted the Sheriff's motion to strike that affidavit and Braga has failed to make any argument that the district court erred in striking that affidavit. Therefore the affidavit is not part of the record before us.</p>\n<p>[7]  We need not reach an additional, obvious infirmity with Braga's Section 1983 claim, namely that he cannot connect his allegedly poor medical treatment to any action or inaction of the Sheriff or to any policy or practice of the county.</p>\n\n</div>",

McCormick, III, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Mary Jo Harris with whom Robert P. Morris and Morgan, Brown &amp; Joy, LLP, were on brief for appellee Hodgson.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, SOUTER, Associate Justice,<sup>[*]</sup> and STAHL, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>STAHL, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff-appellant Joseph Braga, a former inmate at the Bristol County House of Correction in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, brought suit against defendant-appellee Thomas Hodgson, Sheriff of Bristol County, Massachusetts.<sup>[1]</sup> Braga alleged that the Sheriff's negligent maintenance of the facility caused him physical injuries (the \"negligence claim\") and that the Sheriff intentionally or with deliberate indifference denied Braga proper medical care, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (the \"Section 1983 claim\"). After considering written and oral argument, the district court granted summary judgment in the Sheriff's favor on both counts. Having carefully reviewed the record, we affirm. Braga also appeals the district court's entry of a protective order preventing Braga from deposing the Sheriff. We affirm that decision as well.</p>\n<p>We first address the protective order issue, because Braga argues that his ability to create an adequate record to survive summary judgment was undermined by not being permitted to depose the Sheriff. Braga asserts that he made six attempts to schedule a deposition of the Sheriff over the course of a year, all of which were rebuffed due to scheduling conflicts. Only after these six attempts did the Sheriff move for a protective order.</p>\n<p>Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) a party may seek a protective order to prevent or limit discovery in order to avoid \"annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.\" While we generally favor broad pretrial discovery, it is also true that the \"trial judge has broad discretion in ruling on pre-trial management matters, and we review the district court's denial of discovery for abuse of its considerable discretion.\" <i>Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726050\"><a href=\"/opinion/726050/71-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1398-35-fedrserv3d-395-miguel-angel/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 91 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>The district court's oral decision granting the protective order rested on a determination that, with all other discovery completed, Braga had failed to put forth any evidence whatsoever that (1) the Sheriff had any personal knowledge of Braga's health care or (2) there was any basis for a <i>Monell</i> claim<sup>[2]</sup> that there was a policy or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> practice of denying health care to inmates. The court therefore granted the protective order, concluding that Braga's request to depose the Sheriff did not conform to Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1), which requires that \"the discovery appear[] reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\"</p>\n<p>Having reviewed the summary judgment record, we agree with the district court's conclusion that Braga put forth no evidence or plausible argument suggesting that a deposition of Hodgson was reasonably calculated to lead to other discoverable materials regarding his claims against the Sheriff. <i>See </i><i>Heidelberg Americas, Inc. v. Tokyo Kikai Seisakusho, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200515\"><a href=\"/opinion/200515/heidelberg-americas-v-tokyo-kikai/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 41-42 (1st Cir.2003). Neither at the motion hearing nor in his papers to the district court or this court has Braga plausibly suggested that the Sheriff had any personal knowledge of Braga's medical care or that there was any policy or practice of denial of health care. As such, the request to depose was not reasonably calculated to yield discoverable materials and was instead closer to a fishing expedition.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718191\"><a href=\"/opinion/718191/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1305-34-fedrserv3d-1566-rachel-l-fennell/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span>, 533-34 (1st Cir.1996). Thus, finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm the grant of the protective order.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Braga also appeals from the district court's grant of summary judgment as to the negligence and Section 1983 claims. We review both decisions de novo, <i>Singh v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Mass., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200100\"><a href=\"/opinion/200100/singh-v-blue-cross/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2002), and will affirm if there is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\" <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/jack-anderson-v-liberty-lobby-inc-and-willis-a-carto/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>, 250, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/jack-anderson-v-liberty-lobby-inc-and-willis-a-carto/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2505</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/jack-anderson-v-liberty-lobby-inc-and-willis-a-carto/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span> (1986). Importantly, the nonmoving party \"may not rest upon mere allegation ... but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 256. Employing these standards, we affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment for the following reasons.</p>\n<p>First, the negligence claim was properly dismissed because Braga failed to comply with the presentment requirement of Massachusetts General Law 258, Section 4 (the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act), which obliges a claimant to first present a negligence claim against a public employer to the executive officer of the public employer. <i>See </i><i>Weaver v. Commonwealth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2102637\"><a href=\"/opinion/2102637/weaver-v-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2102637\"><a href=\"/opinion/2102637/weaver-v-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span>, 833-36 (1982). Braga stipulated before the district court that he made no such presentment and he offers no compelling argument on appeal that we should ignore the rule that presentment should be made \"in strict compliance with the statute.\" <i>Id.</i> at 834, 47, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2102637\"><a href=\"/opinion/2102637/weaver-v-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>. We therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment as to the negligence claim.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> Second, the district court also properly granted summary judgment as to Braga's Section 1983 claim against the Sheriff in his individual and official capacities. As to Braga's individual capacity claim, the summary judgment record showed absolutely no evidence of the Sheriff's personal involvement with or knowledge of Braga's medical care.<sup>[6]</sup><i>See </i><i>Rogan v. Menino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198447\"><a href=\"/opinion/198447/rogan-v-menino/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.1999) (\"It is axiomatic that the liability of persons sued in their individual capacities under section 1983 must be gauged in terms of their own actions.\"). Therefore, this claim has no merit and summary judgment was warranted.</p>\n<p>As to the Sheriff's actions in his official capacity, the district court granted summary judgment because it found that there was not sufficient evidentiary support to sustain Braga's claim of an Eighth Amendment violation. Having reviewed the summary judgment record, we agree.</p>\n<p>Where a prisoner claims that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated by denial of access to proper medical care, \"he must prove that the defendants' actions amounted to `deliberate indifference to a serious medical need.'\" <i>DesRosiers v. Moran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572165\"><a href=\"/opinion/572165/steven-m-desrosiers-v-john-j-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting <i>Estelle v. Gamble,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 106, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span> (1976)). \"Moreover, inadvertent failures to provide medical care, even if negligent, do not sink to the level of deliberate indifference. In order to establish deliberate indifference, the complainant must prove that the defendants had a culpable state of mind and intended wantonly to inflict pain.\" <i>Id.</i> at 19 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Braga's allegations of harm inflicted by prison officials come nowhere near the level of deliberate indifference required. Braga cites four incidents which he says were sufficient to permit his claim against the Sheriff to survive summary judgement. Two of these claims (that a prison doctor refused to provide answers over the phone to a hospital emergency room doctor regarding Braga's heart medication, and that a prison doctor threatened Braga with solitary confinement if he kept submitting sick slips complaining of health problems) only involve allegations of wrong-doing by doctors employed by Prison Health Services, Inc., rather than corrections officials. Without more, they therefore do not support an Eighth Amendment claim against the Sheriff.</p>\n<p>Braga's other two allegations implicate corrections officials. First, he alleges that on one occasion corrections officers removed him from the medical unit before he received his daily medication in order to comply with the guard schedule. However, he does not allege that he suffered any ill effect from this medication delay.</p>\n<p>Second, he alleges that officers removed him from a hospital before he had a heart ventricle unblocked, contrary to doctor's orders. However, the medical report in the record shows that he was discharged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> by the hospital after undergoing a cardiac catheterization that ruled out a heart attack and confirmed \"mild to moderate disease involving the [left anterior descending artery] with normal left ventricular function.\" The recommended treatment was \"ongoing medical therapy ... for risk factor modification\" and use of a \"lipid-lowering agent.\" In other words, his discharge appears consistent with the medical recommendation of the hospital physicians. Further, at his own deposition, Braga admitted that the hospital doctors \"said [the heart problem] would eventually need to be taken care of. And when I asked if it was life-threatening, they said no.\" We therefore agree with the district court that Braga failed to put forth any evidence at all to support his theory of deliberate indifference to his medical care.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's grant of a protective order and entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United states, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Braga also named Prison Health Services, Inc. (\"PHS\") as a defendant in his amended complaint. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of PHS on one count (a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983), but denied summary judgment as to a second claim against PHS (negligent provision of medical care regarding surgical repair of his knee). Braga and PHS apparently settled the negligence claim without proceeding to trial.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>See </i><i>Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>, 694-95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span> (1978) (permitting Section 1983 suits against municipalities and other local governments for a policy or custom that violates an individual's constitutional rights).</p>\n<p>[3]  This conclusion is based on the paucity of evidence put forth by Braga in support of his claims against the Sheriff. We thus affirm the district court's grant of a protective order without reaching the issue pressed by the Sheriff on appeal, namely that his status as a high-ranking public official provides an alternative ground to affirm the protective order grant. A resolution of this issue is not necessary here.</p>\n<p>[4]  In its oral decision on the protective order, the district court rightly acknowledged that deciding that issue required the court to consider, at least preliminarily, the viability on the merits of Braga's claims against the Sheriff. Indeed, the two issues are closely intertwined for our purposes as well.</p>\n<p>[5]  We also note that, beyond the presentment problem, Braga's own deposition fatally undermined his negligence claim. He alleged in his complaint that the Sheriff failed to maintain the jail in a reasonably safe manner, which in turn caused an injury to his knee. Yet Braga was unable, at deposition, to identify the cause of the knee injury or what area of the jail had been negligently maintained. When asked how his knee was injured he replied, \"I do not know.\" He went on to answer similar questions with \"I don't know,\" \"I don't remember,\" and \"I just don't remember what [the cause of the injury] was.\" Plainly, then, there was no factual basis for his claim of negligence.</p>\n<p>[6]  On appeal, Braga attempts to create a question of material fact on this issue by pointing to his post-deposition affidavit wherein he, Braga, alleged that he sent several letters to the Sheriff complaining of his medical treatment while he was incarcerated. However, the district court granted the Sheriff's motion to strike that affidavit and Braga has failed to make any argument that the district court erred in striking that affidavit. Therefore the affidavit is not part of the record before us.</p>\n<p>[7]  We need not reach an additional, obvious infirmity with Braga's Section 1983 claim, namely that he cannot connect his allegedly poor medical treatment to any action or inaction of the Sheriff or to any policy or practice of the county.</p>\n\n</div>",
