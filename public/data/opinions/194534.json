Plaintiff Beatrice\n                                        \n\nMaynard brought this action in the district court to compel\n\ndisclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"), 5\n\nU.S.C.   552, of certain government documents and parts of\n\ndocuments pertaining to the disappearance of her former\n\nhusband, Robert Thompson, during a flight over Cuba in\n\nDecember of 1961.  Maynard had sought information about this\n\nfrom various agencies, including the Central Intelligence\n\nAgency (\"CIA\"), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"),\n\nthe Defense Intelligence Agency (\"DIA\"), the State\n\nDepartment, the Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\n(\"INS\"), the United States Customs Service (\"Customs\n\nService\"), the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\"), the\n\nNational Personnel Records Center (\"NPRC\"), and the Navy\n\nDepartment.1  While certain records and other materials were\n\nprovided to her, Maynard felt that she was entitled to more,\n\nand so brought this suit.\n\n          After reviewing several documents in camera, the\n                                                     \n\ndistrict court ordered disclosure of two items of information\n\n   one name and one paragraph    that the government had\n\nexpressly redacted from materials it had furnished to\n\nplaintiff.  The CIA appeals from the court's direction to\n\nreveal the paragraph, arguing that the paragraph was properly\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  district  court   granted  the  parties'  stipulated\ndismissal  of the  FAA, the  NPRC, and  the Navy  in February\n1990.\n\n                             -4-\n\nwithheld under FOIA's Exemptions 1 and 3, 5 U.S.C.  \n\n552(b)(1), (3).2  In all other respects, the district court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the defendant agencies,\n\ndenying plaintiff's requests for further information, for\n\nfurther document searches, and for attorney's fees. \n\nPlaintiff now appeals from these judgments.\n\n          Finding that Exemptions 1 and 3 authorize the CIA's\n\nwithholding of the redacted paragraph, we reverse the order\n\nrequiring the CIA to disclose it3.  We affirm the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment for the defendant agencies.\n\n                              I.\n\n          1.  The CIA's Appeal\n                              \n\n          On January 22, 1987, plaintiff submitted FOIA\n\nrequests to the defendant agencies, seeking any information\n\n                    \n\n2.  FOIA  Exemption  1 provides  that  the FOIA's  disclosure\nrequirements  do  not  apply  to  matters  that  are  \"(1)(A)\nspecifically  authorized under  criteria  established  by  an\nExecutive order to be kept secret in the interest of national\ndefense  or  foreign  policy  and (B)  are  in  fact properly\nclassified  pursuant to  such Executive order.\"   5  U.S.C.  \n552(b)(1).   The  information  at issue  here was  classified\npursuant to Executive Order 12356, 47 Fed. Reg. 14874 (1982).\n     FOIA Exemption  3 pertains to matters  that are exempted\nfrom  disclosure by a statute that  either \"(A) requires that\nthe matters be  withheld from the public in such  a manner as\nto  leave  no discretion  on  the issue,  or  (B) establishes\nparticular criteria  for withholding or  refers to particular\ntypes of matters to be withheld.\"  5 U.S.C.   552(b)(3).  The\nexempting  statute  here  is  50 U.S.C.     403(d)(3),  which\nprovides that \"the Director  of Central Intelligence shall be\nresponsible  for protecting intelligence  sources and methods\nfrom unauthorized disclosure.\"\n\n3.  For  the record, that order  was not issued  by the Judge\nfrom whose final orders the appeal is taken.\n\n                             -5-\n\nthey might have concerning her former husband, Robert\n\nThompson.  She said he disappeared along with Robert Swanner\n\non a flight over Cuba, in December of 1961.  Thompson\n\napparently was involved in the distribution of anti-Castro\n\nleaflets; plaintiff believed him to have worked for the CIA. \n\nAmong documents produced by the FBI in response  to\n\nplaintiff's requests was a redacted memo dated December 22,\n\n1961.  The FBI informed plaintiff that the excised\n\ninformation had originated with the CIA and was being\n\nwithheld under FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3 at the CIA's request. \n\nPlaintiff brought this action in the district court in\n\nFebruary 1988, seeking more complete disclosure, including\n\ndisclosure of the withheld paragraph.\n\n          After the agency defendants moved for summary\n\njudgment, the district court in March of 1990 ordered the\n\ngovernment to submit for the court's in camera inspection all\n                                              \n\nwithheld and redacted documents in their complete form.  The\n\ngovernment did so on May 1, 1990.  Among the documents\n\nsubmitted were thirty-two pages the FBI had located in its\n\nsearch for documents responsive to plaintiff's FOIA\n\nrequest.4  This material included the redacted memo of\n\n                    \n\n4.  The State Department also  submitted for in camera review\n                                                      \na document on which the State Department had redacted certain\nidentifying information,  such as the  names of  individuals,\nfor personal privacy concerns pursuant to FOIA Exemption 6.\n\n                             -6-\n\nDecember 22, 1961 that has since become the subject of the\n\nCIA's appeal.  \n\n          To help explain its position, the CIA submitted to\n\nthe district court the public declaration of Katherine M.\n\nStricker, an Information Review Officer for the CIA's\n\nDirectorate of Operations.  With respect to Exemption 1,\n\nwhich exempts national security information classified\n\npursuant to an Executive Order, Stricker explained that she\n\nhad personally reviewed the classification determinations\n\nunder the standards of Executive Order 12356.  Based on that\n\nreview, Stricker determined that the withheld information\n\nwould \"reveal the identity of an intelligence source or\n\ndisclose an intelligence method,\" the unauthorized disclosure\n\nof which, \"either by itself or in the context of other\n\ninformation, reasonably could be expected to cause damage to\n\nthe national security.\"  See Executive Order 12356,   \n                            \n\n1.3(a)(4), (c), 47 Fed. Reg. 14874, 14876.  Accordingly, she\n\nsaid, the information was properly classified at the \"SECRET\n\nlevel\" and was exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 1.\n\n          With respect to Exemption 3, which protects\n\ninformation exempted from disclosure by statute, Stricker\n\nexplained that, similar to Executive Order 12356, the\n\nNational Security Act, 50 U.S.C.   403(d)(3), requires the\n\nDirector of the CIA to protect intelligence sources and\n\nmethods from unauthorized disclosure.  Stricker concluded\n\n                             -7-\n\nthat the redacted information fell within the ambit of the\n\nstatute because it identified the use of particular\n\nintelligence methods used during specific time periods. \n\nAccording to Stricker, the release of such information would\n\nallow hostile intelligence organizations to neutralize the\n\nuse of those methods, thereby causing a concomitant loss of\n\nintelligence.\n\n          On November 14, 1990, the district court ordered\n\nthe government to give to plaintiff information from three of\n\nthe documents subject to in camera review.  This included the\n                                  \n\ninformation at issue here    the third full paragraph on page\n\n2 of the December 22, 1961 memo.5  The CIA moved for\n\nreconsideration of the portion of the court's order regarding\n\nthe redacted paragraph and submitted an in camera declaration\n                                                 \n\nby Stricker, which explained in further detail the nature of\n\nthe information withheld.  On February 1, 1991, the district\n\ncourt granted the CIA's motion for reconsideration, but on\n\nreconsideration, the court affirmed its earlier ruling,\n\nfinding that \"the movant's assertion that disclosure will\n\n                    \n\n5.  The  district court's  order of  November 14,  1990, also\nrequired  disclosure  of  material  contained  in  two  other\ndocuments:   (1) a single name (E.L. Johnson) contained in an\nFBI  document dated November 20, 1961; and (2) the third full\nparagraph of an FBI memorandum  dated July 5, 1962.   The FBI\nrequested the district court to reconsider the portion of the\norder regarding the July 5, 1962 memorandum, arguing that the\nmaterial was exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 7(D)\nas  information obtained  from  a confidential  source.   The\ndistrict court  granted the FBI's  motion for reconsideration\nand vacated that portion of its order on February 1, 1991.\n\n                             -8-\n\n'reveal its sources and methods' in a matter now\n\napproximately thirty years old is without substance and is,\n\nindeed, the height of bureaucratic disingenuousness.\"  The\n\nCIA appeals from this order.\n\n                             -9-\n\n          A.  FOIA Exemption 3\n                              \n\n          The FOIA gives members of the public access to\n\ndocuments held in government files.  Every federal agency\n\n\"upon any request for records which . . . reasonably\n\ndescribes such records\" must make the records \"promptly\n\navailable to any person.\"  5 U.S.C.   552(a)(3).  Nine\n\ncategories of documents are exempted from this broad\n\ndisclosure requirement.\n\n               Exemption 3 permits a federal agency to\n\nwithhold matters that are:\n\n          (3) specifically exempted from disclosure\n          by statute . . . provided that such\n          statute (A) requires that the matters be\n          withheld from the public in such a manner\n          as to leave no discretion on the issue,\n          or (B) establishes particular criteria\n          for withholding or refers to particular\n          types of matters to be withheld.\n\n5 U.S.C.   552(b)(3).  Two questions need to be answered in\n\ndetermining whether Exemption 3 applies in a particular\n\nsituation.  CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 167 (1985).  First,\n                       \n\ndoes the statute constitute a \"statutory exemption to\n\ndisclosure within the meaning of Exemption 3\"?  Second, is\n\nthe requested information \"included within\" the statute's\n\n\"protection\"?  Id.\n                  \n\n          The first question has already been answered\n\naffirmatively for present purposes.  In Sims, the Supreme\n                                            \n\nCourt held that 50 U.S.C.   403(d)(3), which provides that\n\n\"the Director of Central Intelligence shall be responsible\n\n                             -10-\n\nfor protecting intelligence sources and methods from\n\nunauthorized disclosure,\" is an Exemption 3 statute because\n\nit specifies the types of material to be withheld under\n\nsubpart (B) of the Exemption.  471 U.S. at 167-68; accord\n                                                         \n\nKnight v.

Cir. 1984).\n\n          In answering the second question    whether the\n\nrequested information is included within the statute's\n\n\"protection\"    this court has stated that,\n\n          once a court determines that the statute\n          in question is an Exemption 3 statute,\n          and that the information requested at\n          least arguably falls within the statute,\n          FOIA de novo review normally ends.\n                      \n\nAronson v. IRS, 973 F.2d 962, 965, 967 (1st Cir. 1992).  \n              \n\n          The Supreme Court has said,\n\n          it is the responsibility of the Director\n          of Central Intelligence, not that of the\n          judiciary, to weigh the variety of\n          complex and subtle factors in determining\n          whether disclosure of information may\n          lead to an unacceptable risk of\n          compromising the Agency's intelligence-\n          gathering process.\n\nSims, 471 U.S. at 180.  In the intelligence area, the Court\n    \n\nhas commented that judges \"have little or no background in\n\nthe delicate business of intelligence gathering\" and may be\n\nunable to comprehend the significance of material that\n\nappears to be innocuous, but in fact can reveal a significant\n\nintelligence source or method.  Id. at 176.  Therefore, in\n                                   \n\n                             -11-\n\ndetermining whether withheld material relates to intelligence\n\nsources or methods, a court must \"accord substantial weight\n\nand due consideration to the CIA's affidavits.\"  E.g.,\n                                                     \n\nFitzgibbon v.

In our opinion, it is at very\n\nleast \"arguable\" that the requested paragraph falls within 50\n\nU.S.C.   403(d)(3) for the reason the CIA gave, to wit, that\n\nit could reveal intelligence methods.

Giving due deference to\n               \n\nthe agency's determination, we hold that the paragraph is\n\nexempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 3 and 50 U.S.C.\n\n                             -12-\n\n  403(d)(3).

FOIA Exemption 1\n                              \n\n          While our decision under Exemption 3 ends the\n\nmatter, we note that FOIA Exemption 1 leads to the same\n\nresult.  Exemption 1 permits the withholding of matters that\n\nare:\n\n          (1)(A) specifically authorized under\n          criteria established by an Executive\n          order to be kept secret in the interest\n          of national defense or foreign policy and\n          (B) are in fact properly classified\n          pursuant to such Executive order.\n\n5 U.S.C.   552(b)(1).  Executive Order 12356, upon which the\n\nCIA relies, specifically authorizes the withholding of\n\ninformation concerning \"intelligence sources and methods,\"  \n\n                    \n\n6.  We  do not  agree  with the  district  court that  merely\nbecause the information  here is thirty years  old, it cannot\ndetrimentally   reveal   intelligence  sources   or  methods.\nPlaintiff conceded at oral argument before this court that if\nthe withheld information  relates to intelligence sources  or\nmethods,  the   passage  of  thirty  years,   by  itself,  is\ninsufficient  to   require   an  agency   to   disclose   the\ninformation.  Courts have  generally rejected  the contention\nthat  the  mere age  of  intelligence  information rules  out\nExemption  3.   Fitzgibbon, 911  F.2d at 763-64.   Reluctance\n                          \nstems from recognition that it is virtually impossible for an\noutsider  to ascertain what effect the passage of time may or\nmay  not have  had to  mitigate the  harm from  disclosure of\nsources and methods.   Such is true, certainly, as  to events\nthat have occurred  well within the careers of living persons\nincluding governmental leaders (like Cuba's leader) still  in\npower.  The  CIA, not the judiciary, is  better able to weigh\nthe  risks that  disclosure  of such  information may  reveal\nintelligence sources  and methods so as  to endanger national\nsecurity.     Courts  have  accordingly  upheld  pursuant  to\nExemption  3  and 50  U.S.C.    403(d)(3) the  withholding of\ninformation as old as  that sought by plaintiff here.

Courts, therefore,\n\naccord substantial deference to the CIA's determination that\n\ninformation must be withheld under Exemption 1, and will\n\nuphold the agency's decision so long as the withheld\n\ninformation \"logically falls into the category of the\n\nexemption indicated,\" and there is no evidence of bad faith\n\n                    \n\n7.  Although  the  standards  are   substantially  identical,\ncourts,  in reviewing  Exemption 1  claims, state  that their\nreview is  de novo.  E.g., Goldberg v. United States Dept. of\n                                                             \nState,  818 F.2d 71, 77  (D.C.

E.g., Bell v. United States, 563\n                                                       \n\nF.2d 484, 487 (1st Cir. 1977); King v.

As already\n       \n\nstated, the information withheld by the CIA in this case\n\n\"arguably\" or \"logically\" pertains to intelligence methods. \n\nThere is no evidence of bad faith on the part of the\n\nagency.8  The redacted paragraph is, therefore, exempt from\n\ndisclosure under FOIA Exemption 1 as well as under Exemption\n\n3.9\n\n                    \n\n8.  Plaintiff  contends  that the  district  court improperly\ndenied discovery, which could have revealed agency bad faith.\nTo support this argument,  plaintiff cites Weisberg v. United\n                                                             \nStates  Dept. of  Justice, 627  F.2d 365,  370-71  (D.C. Cir.\n                         \n1980),  in which the D.C. Circuit noted that discovery may be\nappropriate  when the adequacy  of an  agency's search  is in\ndoubt.     As  discussed   below,  the  agencies'  affidavits\ndemonstrate  that their  searches  here were  adequate.   See\n                                                             \nGillin  v.

In any case, plaintiff's claims\n      \nthat the district court abused its discretion  by denying her\ndiscovery are  devoid of merit.   See infra at 42-43.   Thus,\n                                           \nWeisberg is inapposite.\n        \n\n9.  As with Exemption  3, the  passage of  some thirty  years\ndoes  not,  by itself,  invalidate  the  CIA's showing  under\nExemption 1.   Executive  Order 12356 provides,  without time\nlimit,  that \"[i]nformation  shall be  classified as  long as\nrequired by national security  considerations.\"    1.4(a), 47\nFed. Reg. at 14877.   Unlike its predecessor Executive  Order\n12065, Executive  Order 12356  does not create  a presumption\nfavoring disclosure of information  once it reaches a certain\nage.   Courts  have  recognized that  it  would be  extremely\ndifficult  for   the   judiciary  to   set  particular   time\nlimitations upon Exemption 1, at least within time parameters\nof the duration  we are  discussing here.

This provided an adequate\n\nfactual basis for the district court's decision and obviated\n\nthe need for further Vaughn indices from the CIA.  See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nIrons, 596 F.2d at 471 (in camera inspection of documents\n                                 \n\nalong with in camera testimony can fully establish\n                    \n\napplicability of FOIA exemption); King, 830 F.2d at 228\n                                      \n\n(after holding that Vaughn index was inadequate, D.C.

The State Department\n\nreported that it had found four documents responsive to\n\nplaintiff's request.

The\n\nplaintiff did not challenge the excisions under Exemption 6,\n\nrendering unwarranted a Vaughn index at that time.  The State\n                              \n\nDepartment subsequently submitted a declaration, explaining\n\nthat it had withheld names and other identifying information,\n\nsuch as date and place of birth, address and occupation, of\n\npersons other than plaintiff's deceased husband, because\n\n\"disclosure could subject these individuals or their families\n\nto possible embarrassment or harassment.\"  This declaration\n\nfully met any requirement under Vaughn that the State\n                                      \n\nDepartment provide a reasoned justification for its\n\nwithholdings.  Furthermore, the State Department submitted\n\nthe one redacted document to the district court for in camera\n                                                             \n\nreview.\n\n          Finally, in respect to the FBI, the district court\n\ngranted plaintiff's motion for a Vaughn index.  The FBI\n                                       \n\nthereupon submitted two detailed declarations by David R.\n\nLieberman, a special agent in the Freedom of Information-\n\nPrivacy Acts Section of the FBI.  Mr. Lieberman explained\n\nthat the FBI had released twenty-five of forty-four pages of\n\nmaterial to plaintiff, and justified, by means of coded\n\nindices,13 the withholding of information in order to\n\n                    \n\n13.  In  a \"coded\"  format,  an agency  breaks down  its FOIA\nexemptions  into  subcategories,  explains the  nondisclosure\nrationale  for  each  subcategory, and  then  correlates  the\n\n                             -22-\n\nprotect the personal privacy of former FBI agents and third\n\nparties (Exemption 7(C)) and to protect the identities of and\n\ninformation provided by confidential sources (Exemption\n\n7(D)).  Furthermore, as with the CIA and the State\n\nDepartment, the government submitted all of the FBI's\n\ndocuments for in camera review.  The Lieberman declarations\n                       \n\nand coded indices, in conjunction with the district court's\n\nin camera review of the documents, were adequate to meet any\n         \n\nrequirements under Vaughn that the government provide a\n                         \n\nreasoned justification for its withholdings.  See, e.g.,\n                                                       \n\n                    \n\nsubcategories  to each  document  or portion  withheld.   For\nexample, the Lieberman declaration was  accompanied by copies\nof  the documents  in  their redacted  form.   Next  to  each\nredaction was  a code designation that corresponds  to a FOIA\nexemption and  a subcategory  of information.   For instance,\none  of  the  subcategories  for  information  withheld under\nExemption  7(C)  was names  and  initials of  FBI  agents and\nsupport personnel.  A coded symbol (b7C-1) would  appear next\nto  any   deletions  that  fit  within   this  exemption  and\nsubcategory of information.   Use of  coded indices has  been\nexplicitly approved by several circuit courts as long as each\ndeletion is correlated \"specifically and unambiguously to the\ncorresponding  exemption,\"  and the  agency  affidavit places\n\"each   document  into   its  historical   and  investigative\ncontext.\"  See, e.g., Keys v. United States Dept. of Justice,\n                                                            \n830  F.2d 337, 349-50 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  Use of coded indices\nis fully  consistent with the Supreme  Court's endorsement of\n\"workable  rules,\"   under   which  general   categories   of\ninformation  may be  withheld under  certain FOIA  exemptions\n\"without  regard to  individual  circumstances.\"   See United\n                                                             \nStates Dept. of Justice v.

The crucial issue is not whether relevant documents\n\nmight exist, but whether the agency's search was \"reasonably\n\n                             -24-\n\ncalculated to discover the requested documents.\"  Safecard\n                                                          \n\nServs., Inc. v.

E.g., Miller v.\n                                                         \n\nUnited States Dept. of State, 779 F.2d 1378, 1383 (8th Cir.\n                            \n\n1985); Weisberg, 745 F.2d at 1485.  A satisfactory agency\n               \n\naffidavit should, at a minimum, describe in reasonable detail\n\nthe scope and method by which the search was conducted.  See,\n                                                             \n\ne.g., Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68; Perry v. Block, 684 F.2d 121,\n                                             \n\n127 (D.C.

Plaintiff's FOIA request, however, was\n\nlimited to \"information pertaining to Robert Thompson.\"14 \n\nBecause the scope of a search is limited by a plaintiff's\n\nFOIA request, there is no general requirement that an agency\n\nsearch secondary references or variant spellings.  See Gillin\n                                                             \n\nv. IRS, No. 92-1803, slip op. at 6 (1st Cir. December 7,\n      \n\n1992) (quoting Meeropol v.

Plaintiff sent identical FOIA requests to each defendant\nagency stating the following:  \"I  am requesting, through the\nFOIA,  any  information you  may  have  concerning my  former\nhusband, Robert  Thompson.

Nor is there any requirement that an agency\n\nconduct further searches on the basis of unspecified \"clues\"\n\nin released documents.\n\n          Second, plaintiff complains that the declarations\n\nsubmitted by the FBI and the CIA were not based on personal\n\nknowledge.  However, an agency need not submit an affidavit\n\nfrom the employee who actually conducted the search. \n\nInstead, an agency may rely on an affidavit of an agency\n\nemployee responsible for supervising the search.  E.g.,\n                                                      \n\nSafecard Servs., 926 F.2d at 1201; cf. Weisberg v.

Cir. 1983).  Here, the\n                \n\nFBI submitted several declarations of David Lieberman, a\n\nsupervisor in the FOIA section of the FBI's records division,\n\nwho reviewed the information in his official capacity. \n\nSimilarly, the CIA submitted the declarations of John Wright\n\nand Katherine Stricker, the persons responsible for directing\n\nFOIA searches at the CIA and determining the applicability of\n\nFOIA exemptions.  These affidavits, although partly second-\n\nhand, are sufficient to satisfy the government's burden of\n\nsubmitting affidavits of responsible agency officials.\n\n                             -27-\n\n          Plaintiff also makes numerous arguments directed at\n\njust one of the defendant agencies.  With respect to the FBI,\n\nplaintiff contends that the FBI improperly limited its search\n\nto \"105, 106\" references, rather than to all references. \n\nThis argument was first raised in an untimely motion for\n\nreconsideration and was denied because it \"should have been\n\nraised earlier.\"  This court, therefore, reviews the denial\n\nonly for an abuse of discretion.  E.g., National Metal\n                                                      \n\nFinishing Co. v.

The FBI submitted a declaration\n\nexplaining that the \"105, 106\" reference was contained on a\n\n1969 FOIA search slip, not plaintiff's 1987 search slip. \n\nConsequently, the agency did not limit its search for\n\ndocuments responsive to plaintiff's FOIA request to the \"105,\n\n106\" reference.  The district court clearly did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying plaintiff's motion for reconsideration\n\non the basis of the scope of the FBI's search.\n\n          With respect to the CIA, plaintiff complains that\n\nsummary judgment was improper because the CIA's affidavits\n\nwere not sufficiently detailed to enable plaintiff to\n\nchallenge the adequacy of the CIA's search.  Plaintiff\n\nfurther argues that, in any case, it is clear that the CIA's\n\nsearch was inadequate because a 1963 memorandum released to\n\nplaintiff contains a reference to other \"records,\" which have\n\n                             -28-\n\nnot been disclosed.  According to plaintiff, the potential\n\nexistence of other records with no explanation by the CIA for\n\nits failure to produce those other records demonstrates the\n\ninadequacy of the CIA's search for responsive documents.\n\n          Plaintiff's argument regarding the sufficiency of\n\nthe CIA's affidavits is unpersuasive.  The CIA submitted\n\nseveral public declarations by John H. Wright, its\n\nInformation and Privacy Coordinator, explaining that the CIA\n\nconducted two searches    first, of officially released\n\ndocuments15 and, second, of the records of the three\n\nDirectorates where it believed responsive records would be\n\nfound, including the Directorates of Operations (records of\n\nclandestine foreign intelligence and counter intelligence\n\nactivities), Intelligence (records interpreting important\n\nworld events), and Administration (records of employees). \n\nWright's declaration of December 7, 1988 sets forth in a very\n\ngeneral manner the method by which the CIA retrieves\n\ndocuments.16  The Wright declaration further explains that\n\n                    \n\n15.  The search of officially released  documents yielded one\nresponsive document, which was  forwarded to plaintiff.  This\ndocument,  a March 20,  1963 memorandum, states  that the CIA\nhad  no connection with plaintiff's  husband or the flight in\nquestion.\n\n16.  The Wright declaration  explains that the  CIA's records\nsystems are diverse,  decentralized, and compartmentalized in\norder  to  enhance  security   of  documents  by   minimizing\naccidental disclosure of sensitive information.  With respect\nto the CIA's method  of retrieving documents, the declaration\nstates the following:\n\n                             -29-\n\n                    \n\n          3.   The  nature  and  design of  the  CIA  records\n     systems  are determined  by the  nature of  the Agency's\n     intelligence activities and responsibilities.  Documents\n     are generally  retrievable if they  are in a  file which\n     contains a collection of  documents on the same subject,\n     and the subject  is indexed  in a system  that alerts  a\n     searcher to the existence  and location of the file,  or\n     if the document is individually indexed in a system that\n     alerts a searcher  to the document.   If information  is\n     stored  other than  on paper,  it must  be indexed  in a\n     manner which  alerts the  searcher to its  existence and\n     location.     The  manner  in  which   the  CIA  indexes\n     information  for storage  and retrieval  purposes varies\n     according to  the nature  of  the intelligence  activity\n     that the  records are intended to support.   Our ability\n     to  retrieve  data  from   a  given  records  system  is\n     determined by  what information  has been stored  in the\n     system  and how  the  system is  designed for  retrieval\n     purposes.\n          4.   It  is crucial  to note  that the  CIA records\n     storage  processing and  retrieval systems  are designed\n     and programmed to respond to the particular intelligence\n                                                             \n     responsibilities and problems of the component using the\n     system.  For example, a component charged with political\n     analysis of a particular  foreign power may organize its\n     files   under   various  subjects--names   of  prominent\n     politicians, party names, geographical concentrations of\n     power,   etc.    Another  component,  with  a  different\n     intelligence  mission, may set up its files in a totally\n     different   fashion.    Accordingly,  the  structure  of\n     particular records systems are not uniform  but, rather,\n     differ according to the intelligence responsibilities of\n     the component  maintaining the system.   Moreover,  some\n     records  systems  are  such  an  integral  part  of  the\n     associated intelligence activity that the  record system\n     necessarily  bears  the   same  classification  as   the\n     intelligence activity. . . .\n          5.  When Privacy Act and FOIA requests are received\n     in the Information Services  Division (ISD), the initial\n     reception  point  for all such requests  received by the\n     CIA, a determination is made by experienced personnel in\n     ISD as to what components of the Agency might reasonably\n     be expected to possess records which might be responsive\n     to each  request.  Copies  of the requesting  letter are\n     then forwarded to each such component  with instructions\n     that  a search  be  made for  any responsive  documents.\n     This initial step is called \"tasking\" of the components.\n     Searches are then routinely  made among all indices that\n\n                             -30-\n\nsome of the record systems searched in response to\n\nplaintiff's FOIA request are classified.17  According to\n\nWright, \"a detailed discussion would entail the disclosure of\n\nclassified information, including information revealing\n\nintelligence sources and methods.\"  Since public disclosure\n\nof additional details about the CIA's structure and its FOIA\n\nsearch here was not possible, the CIA submitted an in camera\n                                                            \n\ndeclaration detailing the searches conducted by the CIA for\n\nresponsive documents.  After reviewing the public and in\n                                                        \n\n                    \n\n     might logically have any  information relating to .  . .\n     the substance  of  request  under  the FOIA.    In  this\n     regard, it  is necessary  to understand that  the search\n     for  records in  each individual component  is dependent\n     upon  the  component's  unique  indexing  system.    The\n     indices are the source of  any clues into the  existence\n     and location  of responsive  records.  For  example, the\n     indexing   systems   for   records  contained   in   the\n     Directorate of Operations (DO) are not the same as those\n     used in the  Office of  Security (OS).   Therefore,  the\n     search for records in each component must be carried out\n     by an  individual who has knowledge  of that component's\n     indexing system. . . .\n\nThe declaration, however, provides no details as to the CIA's\nsearch for documents responsive to plaintiff's FOIA request.\n\n17.  The National Security Act, 50 U.S.C.   403g, provides in\nrelevant part:\n\n     In  the  interests  of   the  security  of  the  foreign\n     intelligence  activities of  the  United  States and  in\n     order  further  to  implement  the  proviso  of  section\n     403(d)(3)  of this  title that  the Director  of Central\n     Intelligence   shall   be  responsible   for  protecting\n     intelligence  sources  and  methods   from  unauthorized\n     disclosure,  the Agency shall be exempted from . . . the\n     provisions   of  any  other   law  which   requires  the\n     publication   or   disclosure   of   the   organization,\n     functions, names, official titles, salaries,  or numbers\n     of personnel employed by the Agency.\n\n                             -31-\n\ncamera declarations of Mr. Wright, we are satisfied that the\n      \n\nCIA's search was \"reasonably calculated to discover the\n\nrequested documents.\"  See Safecard Servs., 926 F.2d at 1201.\n                                          \n\n          As the CIA has provided relatively detailed\n\naffidavits demonstrating the reasonableness of its search, we\n\nreject plaintiff's argument regarding the 1963 memorandum's\n\nreference to other \"records.\"  As the district court noted,\n\nthe fact a 1963 document refers to the existence of other\n\nrecords does not independently generate an issue of material\n\nfact rendering summary judgment improper so long as\n\nreasonably detailed, nonconclusory affidavits demonstrate the\n\nreasonableness of the agency's search performed in 1990. \n\nSee, e.g., Miller, 779 F.2d at 1385.\n                 \n\n          As to the Customs Service, plaintiff contends that\n\nsummary judgment on the adequacy of the agency's search was\n\nimproper because (1) the Customs Service improperly limited\n\nits search to its automated Treasury Enforcement\n\nCommunications System (\"TECS\"); (2) the declarations\n\nsubmitted by the Customs \n\nService are inconsistent; and (3) the Customs Service did not\n\nsearch possible border crossing records for the period prior\n\nto 1982 because it would involve \"significant effort.\"   \n\n          Plaintiff's first two arguments are interrelated\n\nand neither has any merit.  The Custodian of Records for all\n\nelectronic records, Ellen Mulvenna, submitted three separate\n\n                             -32-\n\ndetailed affidavits explaining the structure of the Customs\n\nService's record systems.  Plaintiff suggests that the\n\nMulvenna declarations are inconsistent because the first\n\ndeclaration states that the original TECS records date back\n\nto the early 1970's and the second declaration states that\n\nall investigatory records, including records in the 1960's,\n\nare included in the TECS.  Contrary to plaintiff's assertion,\n\nthese statements appear to be fully consistent.  According to\n\nthe later Mulvenna affidavits, the TECS system was created in\n\n1970.  At that time, all existing records were placed in the\n\nTECS.  Therefore, as explained in the third Mulvenna\n\naffidavit, the Customs Service's search was appropriately\n\nlimited to the TECS system since \"[a]ny information on\n\nPlaintiff's missing husband that might have been contained in\n\nthe records of the U.S. Customs Service as of the date that\n\nthe TECS system was created in 1970 would have been placed in\n\nthe TECS data system.\"\n\n          Plaintiff's challenge to the adequacy of the\n\nCustoms Service's search is also unpersuasive.  While the\n\ngovernment's declarations acknowledged that a search of\n\nborder crossing data would involve \"significant effort,\" they\n\nalso made clear that such data only exists for dates after\n\n1976, fifteen years after plaintiff's husband disappeared. \n\nIt would seem reasonable, therefore, not to have searched the\n\n                             -33-\n\nborder crossing data, quite apart from any special effort\n\ninvolved.\n\n          Plaintiff's challenges to the State Department's\n\nsearches also lack merit.  Plaintiff complains that (1) the\n\nState Department did not identify who conducted the search or\n\nspecify the background and experience of that person; (2) the\n\nState Department's declaration leaves open the inference that\n\nsome sources that are only 'likely' to contain information\n\nwere not searched; and (3) the declaration does not include a\n\n\"comprehensive listing of 'decentralized record systems.'\"\n\n          There is, however, no general requirement for an\n\nagency to disclose the identity and background of the actual\n\npersons who process FOIA requests.  Plaintiff relies on\n\nWeisberg, 627 F.2d at 371, which reversed a district court's\n        \n\ngrant of summary judgment because the agency affidavits did\n\nnot \"denote which files were searched or by whom, [did] not\n\nreflect any systematic approach to document location, and\n\n[did] not provide information specific enough to enable\n\n[plaintiff] to challenge the procedures utilized.\"  Plaintiff\n\nreads Weisberg too broadly.  See Perry, 684 F.2d at 127\n                                      \n\n(noting that Weisberg \"involved rather special facts that\n                     \n\ntended to cast considerable doubt on the adequacy [of the\n\nagency's search]\" because \"the agency's own assertions\n\nsupported an inference that specifically identified material,\n\nsolicited by the requester, might have remained in the\n\n                             -34-\n\nagency's possession.\").  The point of Weisberg and subsequent\n                                              \n\ncases is that search methods should be ones reasonably\n\ncalculated to locate the requested information, assuming it\n\nexists.  The State Department's declaration suffices to\n\ndemonstrate that its search methods met this standard.18\n\n          Plaintiff's second argument is that the State\n\nDepartment's declaration \"leaves open the inference that some\n\nsources that are only 'likely' to contain information were\n\nnot searched.\"  See Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68 (\"agency cannot\n                           \n\nlimit its search to only one record system if there are\n\nothers that are likely to turn up the information\n\nrequested\").  Plaintiff appears to base this inference upon a\n\nletter from the State Department declaring that it searched\n\nthe two record systems \"most likely to contain the\n                            \n\ninformation\" requested.  However, a subsequent State\n\n                    \n\n18.  The   State   Department's  declaration   explains  that\nresponsive  records,  \"if  they  existed,  would   likely  be\nexpected to be contained in two records systems, namely:  the\nCentral Records; and the Office of Overseas Citizens Services\n[OCS].\"  While name  searches of two of the  three categories\nof Central  Records files (the Automated  Document System and\nthe Lot  Files) turned up  no records, a  name search of  the\n\"personality cross-reference\"  to the Central  Foreign Policy\nFiles  (a  third  category  of  Central  Records)  identified\ntwenty-three responsive documents which  had been sent to the\nOCS  \"for action.\"  The OCS retirement manifests along with a\ndocument-by-document  search revealed that  nineteen of these\ndocuments  \"had been  destroyed in  May, 1979,  in accordance\nwith  approved  disposition  schedules,\" leaving  only  \"four\ndocuments  responsive  to  this   request  [that]  were   not\ndestroyed.\"    Three  of  these documents  were  produced  to\nplaintiff with no excisions, and the fourth was produced with\nminor excisions based on personal privacy grounds pursuant to\nFOIA Exemption 6.\n\n                             -35-\n\nDepartment declaration by its Information and Privacy\n\nCoordinator, Frank M. Machak, declared that searches were\n\nconducted of all \"record systems\" that were \"likely\" to\n\ncontain the information requested.\n\n          Finally, plaintiff's demand for a \"comprehensive\n\nlisting of 'decentralized records systems'\" is also\n\nunfounded.  \"There is no requirement that an agency search\n\nevery record system.\"  Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68.  Nor is there\n                              \n\nany requirement that an agency provide a comprehensive list\n\nof record systems unlikely to contain responsive records. \n\nRather, an agency need only provide \"[a] reasonably detailed\n\naffidavit, setting forth the search terms and the type of\n\nsearch performed, and averring that all files likely to\n\ncontain responsive materials . . . were searched,\" see, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nid., as well as a general description of the structure of the\n   \n\nagency's file system demonstrating why further search would\n\nbe overly burdensome, see Church of Scientology of Cal., 792\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 151.  Because the State Department's affidavits fully\n\nmeet this standard, summary judgment on the adequacy of the\n\nState Department's search was inappropriate.19\n\n                    \n\n19.  Plaintiff  also suggests,  without  further argument  or\nexplanation, that  the State Department should  have searched\nthe records of the  \"Cuba Desk\" and the \"Bureau  of Politico-\nMilitary  Affairs.\"   Plaintiff's suggestion  seems factually\nmisguided.   It appears that  the records of  the \"Cuba Desk\"\n(the  formal name for which is apparently the Office of Cuban\nAffairs  in  the  Bureau   of  Inter-American  Affairs)  were\nsearched.   The Bureau  of Politico-Military Affairs,  on the\nother hand,  is apparently concerned with  remote issues such\n\n                             -36-\n\n          With respect to the DIA's search, plaintiff\n\ncontends that summary judgement was inappropriate because (1)\n\na document that was forwarded from the FBI to the DIA in 1963\n\nwas not located by the DIA in its 1990 search; and (2) the\n\nDIA's declaration does not adequately explain the data bases\n\nsearched or the procedures for information retrieval.\n\n          As to plaintiff's first argument, \"the fact that a\n\ndocument once existed does not mean that it now exists; nor\n\ndoes the fact that an agency created a document necessarily\n\nimply that the agency has retained it.\"  Miller, 779 F.2d at\n                                               \n\n1385.  Thus the failure of the DIA to produce a copy of a\n\ndocument, identified in a 1963 memo, does not mean that the\n\nDIA's search in 1990 was inadequate, particularly when the\n\nDIA has demonstrated that its 1990 search was reasonably\n\ncalculated to uncover responsive documents.  Plaintiff's\n\nsecond contention also lacks merit.  The DIA's declaration\n\nadequately explains the two data bases it searched. \n\nAccording to the DIA's declaration, the Central Reference\n\nDivision of the DIA Directorate for Technical Services and\n\nSupport \"searched its two data bases:  the Intelligence\n\nReport Index Summary Archive (IRISA) and the All Source\n\nDocument Index Archive (ASDIA).\"  IRISA \"contains\n\n                    \n\nas arms control, nuclear  non-proliferation, outer space  and\nthe  coordination of military-related activities with foreign\npolicy.    The records  of  the  Bureau of  Politico-Military\nAffairs, therefore,  seem unlikely to  contain any responsive\ndocuments.\n\n                             -37-\n\nbibliographic references to all human intelligence\n\ninformation reports held or produced by DIA.\"  ASDIA\n\n\"contains bibliographic citations to all intelligence\n\nstudies, contract reports, open source materials maintained\n\nin the DIA library.\"  These two data bases, therefore,\n\nincluded all materials maintained by the DIA that were likely\n\nto contain responsive documents.  A search of these two data\n\nbases failed to produce any information pertaining to\n\nplaintiff's husband.  While the DIA's declaration could have\n\ndescribed the actual search conducted in more detail, any\n\n\"arguable inadequacy of the search descriptions\" is \"no more\n\nthan marginal and does not render the grant of summary\n\njudgment appropriate.\"  See Perry, 684 F.2d at 127.\n                                 \n\n          Finally, plaintiff contends that the INS's search\n\nwas inadequate because it took seventeen months to locate a\n\nresponsive file and because the file was lost in 1985 and not\n\nfound and turned over to plaintiff until after her appeal was\n\ntaken in 1992.  Neither of these arguments is persuasive. \n\nPlaintiff's first contention was raised initially in an\n\nuntimely motion for reconsideration.  Therefore, we review\n\nthe district court's denial of this motion only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.  See, e.g., National Metal Finishing Co., 899\n                                                    \n\nF.2d at 125.  Delay in locating a document \"is significant\n\nonly to the extent that evidence shows that the delay\n\nresulted from bad faith refusal to cooperate.\"  Miller, 779\n                                                      \n\n                             -38-\n\nF.2d at 1386; accord Perry, 684 F.2d at 128 (court upholds\n                          \n\nadequacy of agency search notwithstanding delay of over one\n\nand one half years); Goland, 607 F.2d at 355 (agency delay,\n                           \n\nby itself, is not indicative of lack of good faith).  Because\n\nplaintiff presented no evidence to suggest that the\n\nseventeen-month delay resulted from bad faith, the district\n\ncourt properly denied plaintiff's untimely motion for\n\nreconsideration.  \n\n          Plaintiff's second argument fares no better. \n\nEssentially, plaintiff argues that the fact that a file was\n\nlost and then found undercuts the DIA's contention that its\n\nsearch was reasonable.  See Goland, 607 F.2d at 369-70.  In\n                                  \n\nGoland, one week after the D.C. Circuit affirmed a district\n      \n\ncourt's conclusion that the CIA had conducted an adequate\n\nsearch, see 607 F.2d 339 (D.C. Cir. 1978), the CIA informed\n           \n\nthe Justice Department that it had discovered additional\n\ndocuments responsive to the plaintiff's FOIA request while\n\nthe appeal had been pending.  Although some of these\n\ndocuments were subsequently released to the plaintiff, the\n\nplaintiff sought to have the D.C. Circuit reconsider its\n\nopinion as to the adequacy of the CIA's search, arguing that\n\nthe discovery of additional documents undercut the finding\n\nthat the search had been reasonable.  The D.C. Circuit\n\nrejected the argument, stating that \"[t]he issue was not\n\nwhether any further documents might conceivably exist but\n\n                             -39-\n\nwhether [the agency's] search for responsive documents was\n\nadequate.\"  607 F.2d at 369-70.  Although the court noted\n\nthat the discovery of additional documents may be evidence\n\nthat a search is not thorough, the court was satisfied that\n\n\"the original failure to uncover the documents was wholly\n\nunderstandable and not inconsistent with the district court's\n\nfinding that the search was thorough.\"  Id. at 370, 372; see\n                                                            \n\nalso Miller, 779 F.2d at 1386 (discovery of additional\n           \n\ndocuments is not conclusive of agency bad faith since belated\n\ndiscovery may result merely from administrative inefficiency\n\nor reluctant diligence on the part of the agency); Perry, 684\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 128 (discovery of additional documents indicated\n\n\"neither artifice nor subterfuge but rather, at worse (sic),\n\nadministrative inefficiency.\").  \n\n          Similarly here, the INS submitted a declaration to\n\nthe district court, explaining that the three-page document\n\nresponsive to plaintiff's FOIA request was lost in transit\n\nfrom the Federal Records Center in Atlanta to the INS Central\n\nOffice in Washington, D.C.  More important, the INS submitted\n\nan additional declaration detailing the extensive steps taken\n\nby the INS to locate the missing file, including computer and\n\nmanual shelf-by-shelf searches.  In light of the detailed\n\naffidavits demonstrating the adequacy of the INS's initial\n\nsearch and the subsequent search for the missing file, we are\n\nnot persuaded that the district court was incorrect in\n\n                             -40-\n\nconcluding that the searches were reasonable and in good\n\nfaith.  Instead, the agency's initial inability to find the\n\nmissing file appears to be the result of administrative\n\ninefficiency.  Nor can we say that the agency's subsequent\n\ndiscovery and release of the lost file impugns the integrity\n\nof the INS's affidavits.  Rather than bad faith, we think the\n\nforthright disclosure by the INS that it had located the\n\nmisplaced file suggests good faith on the part of the agency. \n\nSee Meeropol, 790 F.2d at 953 (\"what is expected of a law-\n            \n\nabiding agency is that it admit and correct error when error\n\nis revealed.\").\n\n          In sum, we are satisfied, as was the district\n\ncourt, that each defendant agency presented reasonably\n\ndetailed, nonconclusory affidavits demonstrating the\n\nreasonableness of their respective searches.  We reject\n\nplaintiff's suggestion that the agencies' affidavits were\n\ninsufficient to support summary judgment on the issue of the\n\nadequacy of the agencies' searches.\n\n          D.  FOIA Exemptions\n                             \n\n          Plaintiff contends that the district court\n\nimproperly upheld the FBI's withholding of information under\n\nFOIA Exemption 6 and asks us to join all other defendants in\n\nthis argument.  Exemption 6 permits withholding of the\n\nfollowing:\n\n          personnel and medical files and similar\n          files the disclosure of which would\n\n                             -41-\n\n          constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion\n          of personal privacy.\n\n5 U.S.C.   552(b)(6).  \n\n          It is not surprising that plaintiff was unable to\n\nfind any justification under Exemption 6 for the FBI's\n\nexcisions since the FBI did not claim Exemption 6 as the\n\nbasis of its withholding.  Rather, it claimed Exemption\n\n7(C),20 which permits the withholding of\n\n          records or information compiled for law\n          enforcement purposes,  but only to the\n          extent that the production of such law\n          enforcement records or information . . .\n          (C) could reasonably be expected to\n          constitute an unwarranted invasion of\n          personal privacy.\n\n5 U.S.C.   552(b)(7)(C).\n\n          In analyzing Exemption 7(C) claims, courts balance\n\n\"privacy\" interests against any \"public interest\" in\n\ndisclosure.  United States Dept. of Justice v. Reporters\n                                                        \n\nCommittee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 762 (1989). \n                                  \n\nThe FBI asserted three interests warranting privacy\n\nprotection:  (1) the names and initials of low-level FBI\n\nagents and support personnel; (2) the names and identifying\n\n                    \n\n20.  The FBI  additionally relied  on FOIA Exemption  7(D) to\njustify certain  withholdings.  See 5  U.S.C.   552(b)(7)(D).\n                                   \nExemption  7(D) provides  protection for  confidential source\ninformation.   See,  e.g., Providence  Journal Co.  v. United\n                                                             \nStates Dept. of  Army, No.  92-1166, slip op.  at 20-21  (1st\n                     \nCir. December 8, 1992).   As plaintiff has failed  to present\nany  argumentation with  respect to  Exemption 7(D),  she has\nwaived  any claims of  error regarding this  exemption.  See,\n                                                            \ne.g., Elgabri v.

We need not, therefore, dwell upon the balance\n\nbetween privacy and public interests:  \"something . . .\n\noutweighs nothing every time.\"21  Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at\n                                            \n\n768 (quoting NARFE v.

Accordingly, plaintiff's claim for disclosure fails\n\nunder Exemption 7(C).\n\n          Plaintiff's claim for disclosure fits no better\n\nwithin Exemption 6.  The only agency actually to rely on\n\nExemption 6 for any withholdings is the State Department.  In\n\nits declaration, the State Department explained that it had\n\n                    \n\n21.  For the same reason,  the effect of the passage  of time\nupon the individual's privacy  interests is simply irrelevant\nwhen  a  FOIA  requestor  is  unable  to  suggest  any public\ninterest in  the disclosure of  names that would  reveal what\nthe  government is up to.   Privacy interests,  no matter how\nminimal,  will outweigh  a nonexistent  public interest.   We\ntherefore reject  plaintiff's suggestion that the  FBI should\nhave considered  \"the mitigation  of time\" on  documents over\ntwenty-five years old.\n\n                             -44-\n\nwithheld the names and other identifying information (i.e.,\n                                                          \n\ndate and place of birth, address and occupation), because\n\ndisclosure could subject individuals or their families to\n\nharassment or embarrassment, and the public interest in\n\ndisclosure, if any, was minimal.  This characterization seems\n\nentirely justified.  \n\n          As with Exemption 7(C), courts must balance the\n\nrelative privacy and public interests to determine whether\n\ninformation is properly withheld under Exemption 6.  Although\n\n\"the Government's burden in establishing the requisite\n\ninvasion of privacy to support an Exemption 6 claim is\n\nheavier than the standard applicable to Exemption 7(C),\"\n\nUnited States Dept. of State v.

Therefore,\n                               \n\nany inquiry into the public interest in disclosure of\n\nwithheld information must focus \"on the citizens' right to be\n\ninformed 'about what their government is up to.'\"  Id.\n                                                      \n\n(quoting Reporters Committee, 489 U.S. at 773).

Discovery\n                       \n\n          Plaintiff contends that the district court\n\nimproperly granted protective orders barring certain\n\ninterrogatories and a proposed deposition of Dr. Orlando\n\nBosch-Avila, an individual incarcerated in federal prison in\n\nMiami.23  Neither claim warrants appellate intervention\n\ninto the district court's broad discretion in managing\n\npretrial discovery.  Intervention would be warranted \"only\n\nupon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that is, where\n\n                    \n\n22.  Because plaintiff  does not  challenge any of  the other\nbases for withholdings asserted by the  government, plaintiff\nhas  waived  any  claims concerning  other  FOIA  exemptions.\nE.g., Playboy  Enterprises, Inc. v. Public  Serv. Comm'n, 906\n                                                        \nF.2d  25, 40-41  (1st Cir.),  cert. denied  sub nom.

In support of her  motion to take the deposition  of Dr.\nBosch-Avila, plaintiff submitted the affidavit of  Sherry Ann\nSullivan.   Ms. Sullivan, a  private investigator who is also\nthe  head of \"The Forgotten Families of the CIA,\" had brought\na  similar  FOIA  suit  to plaintiff's.    In  her affidavit,\nSullivan alleged that  a confidential informant  had personal\nknowledge that  Dr. Bosch-Avila  had worked with  both Robert\nThompson and  her father, Geoffrey Sullivan, on CIA-sponsored\nprojects.  Ms. Sullivan further alleged that the testimony of\nDr. Bosch-Avila  would be \"sufficient  for the CIA  to locate\nthe information  and documents  which have been  requested by\nPlaintiff and which the C.I.A. says it cannot locate.\"\n\n                             -46-\n\nthe lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and\n\nresulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\" \n\nMack v.

Examination into the facts relative to the\n\nprotective orders does not reveal \"manifest injustice.\" \n\n          Plaintiff's barred interrogatories were served\n\napproximately six months after the discovery deadline had\n\nlapsed.  Plaintiff did not present any compelling reason for\n\nhaving ignored the deadline.  With respect to the deposition\n\nof Dr. Bosch-Avila, the government moved for a protective\n\norder barring the deposition until plaintiff obtained the\n\nconsent of Dr. Bosch-Avila, a federal prisoner, and gave\n\nadvance notice to government counsel.  The district court\n\ngranted the motion \"without prejudice to the deposition of\n\nthe subject being noticed with at least 10 days notice to\n\ndefense counsel.\"  Plaintiff did not seek to depose Dr.\n\nBosch-Avila at any later date.  It thus appears that\n\nplaintiff's failure to obtain the  discovery in issue was the\n\nresult, in large part, of her own inaction.  The district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in ruling as it did.\n\n          E.  Attorney's Fees\n                             \n\n          Plaintiff contends that the district court erred in\n\nnot awarding her attorney's fees.  A decision as to whether\n\nto award attorney's fees is a matter within the sound\n\ndiscretion of a trial court and will be reversed only for an\n\n                             -47-\n\nabuse of that discretion.

In\n\ndetermining whether a plaintiff has \"substantially prevailed\"\n\nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C.   552(a)(4)(E), a district\n\ncourt must conduct a two-step inquiry.  First, did plaintiff\n\n\"substantially prevail\"?  Second, if so, is plaintiff\n\nentitled to an award based on a balancing of equitable\n\nfactors?  Crooker v. United States Parole Comm'n, 776 F.2d\n                                                \n\n366, 367 (1st Cir. 1985).24  \n\n          The district court in this case denied plaintiff's\n\nmotion for attorney's fees against all of the defendant\n\nagencies, with the exception of the CIA,25 on the basis of\n\nthe first inquiry    i.e., plaintiff had not substantially\n\n                    \n\n24.  These factors  include the following:   \"(1) the benefit\nto  the  public,  if any,  derived  from  the  case; (2)  the\ncommercial benefit to the complainant;  (3) the nature of the\ncomplainant's interest in the records sought; and (4) whether\nthe government's withholding of  the records had a reasonable\nbasis in law.\"  Aronson, 866  F.2d at 3 (quoting Crooker, 776\n                                                        \nF.2d at 367); see also S.

This\n\nconclusion was entirely correct.  In order to prove that a\n\nplaintiff substantially prevailed, a plaintiff must establish\n\nthat the filing of the litigation was \"necessary\" and \"had a\n\ncausative effect on the disclosure of the requested\n\ninformation.\"  Crooker v. United States Dept. of Justice, 632\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 916, 932 (1st Cir. 1980) (citing Vermont Low Income\n                                                        \n\nAdvocacy Council, Inc.

At the time that the district court ruled\n\non the attorney's fee question, plaintiff's suit had resulted\n\nin the disclosure of no documents from the DIA, the Customs\n\nService, or the INS.  The district court therefore was\n\nclearly justified in denying attorney's fees as to these\n\ndefendant agencies.  Although the INS subsequently found and\n\ndelivered a lost document, there is no showing that the suit\n\nwas the cause of the delivery of this document.  We see no\n\nreason, therefore, to disturb the district court's finding\n\nthat plaintiff did not substantially prevail against the INS. \n\nSee Weisberg v.

With the\n       \n\nexception of a single name which the district court ordered\n\nthe FBI to disclose, plaintiff presented no evidence\n\nsuggesting that this litigation was necessary to obtain\n\nrequested information or that the litigation caused the\n\nagency to produce the information.

Accordingly,\n   \n\nthere was no abuse of discretion in the court's finding that\n\nplaintiff did not substantially prevail against the FBI.\n\n          Plaintiff argues that this suit resulted in\n\nprogressively greater disclosure from the FBI, thus meeting\n\nthe causation requirement in 5 U.S.C.   552(a)(4)(E). \n\n                             -50-\n\nAccording to plaintiff, after initiation of the litigation,\n\nshe was provided with material that had previously been\n\nredacted.  This argument, however, was raised for the first\n\ntime in an untimely motion for reconsideration, which the\n\ndistrict court properly denied.  The FBI submitted an\n\naffidavit explaining that the release of the great bulk of\n\nthe redacted material was the result of inter-agency process,\n\nnot this litigation, and the release of the remainder of the\n\npreviously redacted material occurred after the agency became\n\naware that the material had previously been released to\n\nanother individual (thereby requiring its release to\n\nplaintiff).  The district court was within its discretion in\n\nconcluding that plaintiff had not substantially prevailed,\n\nand did not abuse its discretion by refusing to reconsider\n\nthis decision.\n\n                             II.\n\n          The district court's order of November 14, 1990\n\ncompelling the CIA to disclose the third full paragraph on\n\npage 2 of the December 22, 1961 memorandum is reversed.\n                                                      \n\n          The district court's subsequent orders granting\n\nsummary judgment to the CIA, the FBI, the State Department,\n\nthe Customs Service, the INS, and the DIA, as well as its\n\ndecision not to award attorney's fees, are all affirmed.\n                                                       \n\n          So ordered.

Plaintiff Beatrice\n                                        \n\nMaynard brought this action in the district court to compel\n\ndisclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"), 5\n\nU.S.C.   552, of certain government documents and parts of\n\ndocuments pertaining to the disappearance of her former\n\nhusband, Robert Thompson, during a flight over Cuba in\n\nDecember of 1961.  Maynard had sought information about this\n\nfrom various agencies, including the Central Intelligence\n\nAgency (\"CIA\"), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"),\n\nthe Defense Intelligence Agency (\"DIA\"), the State\n\nDepartment, the Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\n(\"INS\"), the United States Customs Service (\"Customs\n\nService\"), the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\"), the\n\nNational Personnel Records Center (\"NPRC\"), and the Navy\n\nDepartment.1  While certain records and other materials were\n\nprovided to her, Maynard felt that she was entitled to more,\n\nand so brought this suit.\n\n          After reviewing several documents in camera, the\n                                                     \n\ndistrict court ordered disclosure of two items of information\n\n   one name and one paragraph    that the government had\n\nexpressly redacted from materials it had furnished to\n\nplaintiff.  The CIA appeals from the court's direction to\n\nreveal the paragraph, arguing that the paragraph was properly\n\n                    \n\n1.  The  district  court   granted  the  parties'  stipulated\ndismissal  of the  FAA, the  NPRC, and  the Navy  in February\n1990.\n\n                             -4-\n\nwithheld under FOIA's Exemptions 1 and 3, 5 U.S.C.  \n\n552(b)(1), (3).2  In all other respects, the district court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the defendant agencies,\n\ndenying plaintiff's requests for further information, for\n\nfurther document searches, and for attorney's fees. \n\nPlaintiff now appeals from these judgments.\n\n          Finding that Exemptions 1 and 3 authorize the CIA's\n\nwithholding of the redacted paragraph, we reverse the order\n\nrequiring the CIA to disclose it3.  We affirm the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment for the defendant agencies.\n\n                              I.\n\n          1.  The CIA's Appeal\n                              \n\n          On January 22, 1987, plaintiff submitted FOIA\n\nrequests to the defendant agencies, seeking any information\n\n                    \n\n2.  FOIA  Exemption  1 provides  that  the FOIA's  disclosure\nrequirements  do  not  apply  to  matters  that  are  \"(1)(A)\nspecifically  authorized under  criteria  established  by  an\nExecutive order to be kept secret in the interest of national\ndefense  or  foreign  policy  and (B)  are  in  fact properly\nclassified  pursuant to  such Executive order.\"   5  U.S.C.  \n552(b)(1).   The  information  at issue  here was  classified\npursuant to Executive Order 12356, 47 Fed. Reg. 14874 (1982).\n     FOIA Exemption  3 pertains to matters  that are exempted\nfrom  disclosure by a statute that  either \"(A) requires that\nthe matters be  withheld from the public in such  a manner as\nto  leave  no discretion  on  the issue,  or  (B) establishes\nparticular criteria  for withholding or  refers to particular\ntypes of matters to be withheld.\"  5 U.S.C.   552(b)(3).  The\nexempting  statute  here  is  50 U.S.C.     403(d)(3),  which\nprovides that \"the Director  of Central Intelligence shall be\nresponsible  for protecting intelligence  sources and methods\nfrom unauthorized disclosure.\"\n\n3.  For  the record, that order  was not issued  by the Judge\nfrom whose final orders the appeal is taken.\n\n                             -5-\n\nthey might have concerning her former husband, Robert\n\nThompson.  She said he disappeared along with Robert Swanner\n\non a flight over Cuba, in December of 1961.  Thompson\n\napparently was involved in the distribution of anti-Castro\n\nleaflets; plaintiff believed him to have worked for the CIA. \n\nAmong documents produced by the FBI in response  to\n\nplaintiff's requests was a redacted memo dated December 22,\n\n1961.  The FBI informed plaintiff that the excised\n\ninformation had originated with the CIA and was being\n\nwithheld under FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3 at the CIA's request. \n\nPlaintiff brought this action in the district court in\n\nFebruary 1988, seeking more complete disclosure, including\n\ndisclosure of the withheld paragraph.\n\n          After the agency defendants moved for summary\n\njudgment, the district court in March of 1990 ordered the\n\ngovernment to submit for the court's in camera inspection all\n                                              \n\nwithheld and redacted documents in their complete form.  The\n\ngovernment did so on May 1, 1990.  Among the documents\n\nsubmitted were thirty-two pages the FBI had located in its\n\nsearch for documents responsive to plaintiff's FOIA\n\nrequest.4  This material included the redacted memo of\n\n                    \n\n4.  The State Department also  submitted for in camera review\n                                                      \na document on which the State Department had redacted certain\nidentifying information,  such as the  names of  individuals,\nfor personal privacy concerns pursuant to FOIA Exemption 6.\n\n                             -6-\n\nDecember 22, 1961 that has since become the subject of the\n\nCIA's appeal.  \n\n          To help explain its position, the CIA submitted to\n\nthe district court the public declaration of Katherine M.\n\nStricker, an Information Review Officer for the CIA's\n\nDirectorate of Operations.  With respect to Exemption 1,\n\nwhich exempts national security information classified\n\npursuant to an Executive Order, Stricker explained that she\n\nhad personally reviewed the classification determinations\n\nunder the standards of Executive Order 12356.  Based on that\n\nreview, Stricker determined that the withheld information\n\nwould \"reveal the identity of an intelligence source or\n\ndisclose an intelligence method,\" the unauthorized disclosure\n\nof which, \"either by itself or in the context of other\n\ninformation, reasonably could be expected to cause damage to\n\nthe national security.\"  See Executive Order 12356,   \n                            \n\n1.3(a)(4), (c), 47 Fed. Reg. 14874, 14876.  Accordingly, she\n\nsaid, the information was properly classified at the \"SECRET\n\nlevel\" and was exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 1.\n\n          With respect to Exemption 3, which protects\n\ninformation exempted from disclosure by statute, Stricker\n\nexplained that, similar to Executive Order 12356, the\n\nNational Security Act, 50 U.S.C.   403(d)(3), requires the\n\nDirector of the CIA to protect intelligence sources and\n\nmethods from unauthorized disclosure.  Stricker concluded\n\n                             -7-\n\nthat the redacted information fell within the ambit of the\n\nstatute because it identified the use of particular\n\nintelligence methods used during specific time periods. \n\nAccording to Stricker, the release of such information would\n\nallow hostile intelligence organizations to neutralize the\n\nuse of those methods, thereby causing a concomitant loss of\n\nintelligence.\n\n          On November 14, 1990, the district court ordered\n\nthe government to give to plaintiff information from three of\n\nthe documents subject to in camera review.  This included the\n                                  \n\ninformation at issue here    the third full paragraph on page\n\n2 of the December 22, 1961 memo.5  The CIA moved for\n\nreconsideration of the portion of the court's order regarding\n\nthe redacted paragraph and submitted an in camera declaration\n                                                 \n\nby Stricker, which explained in further detail the nature of\n\nthe information withheld.  On February 1, 1991, the district\n\ncourt granted the CIA's motion for reconsideration, but on\n\nreconsideration, the court affirmed its earlier ruling,\n\nfinding that \"the movant's assertion that disclosure will\n\n                    \n\n5.  The  district court's  order of  November 14,  1990, also\nrequired  disclosure  of  material  contained  in  two  other\ndocuments:   (1) a single name (E.L. Johnson) contained in an\nFBI  document dated November 20, 1961; and (2) the third full\nparagraph of an FBI memorandum  dated July 5, 1962.   The FBI\nrequested the district court to reconsider the portion of the\norder regarding the July 5, 1962 memorandum, arguing that the\nmaterial was exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 7(D)\nas  information obtained  from  a confidential  source.   The\ndistrict court  granted the FBI's  motion for reconsideration\nand vacated that portion of its order on February 1, 1991.\n\n                             -8-\n\n'reveal its sources and methods' in a matter now\n\napproximately thirty years old is without substance and is,\n\nindeed, the height of bureaucratic disingenuousness.\"  The\n\nCIA appeals from this order.\n\n                             -9-\n\n          A.  FOIA Exemption 3\n                              \n\n          The FOIA gives members of the public access to\n\ndocuments held in government files.  Every federal agency\n\n\"upon any request for records which . . . reasonably\n\ndescribes such records\" must make the records \"promptly\n\navailable to any person.\"  5 U.S.C.   552(a)(3).  Nine\n\ncategories of documents are exempted from this broad\n\ndisclosure requirement.\n\n               Exemption 3 permits a federal agency to\n\nwithhold matters that are:\n\n          (3) specifically exempted from disclosure\n          by statute . . . provided that such\n          statute (A) requires that the matters be\n          withheld from the public in such a manner\n          as to leave no discretion on the issue,\n          or (B) establishes particular criteria\n          for withholding or refers to particular\n          types of matters to be withheld.\n\n5 U.S.C.   552(b)(3).  Two questions need to be answered in\n\ndetermining whether Exemption 3 applies in a particular\n\nsituation.  CIA v.

In our opinion, it is at very\n\nleast \"arguable\" that the requested paragraph falls within 50\n\nU.S.C.   403(d)(3) for the reason the CIA gave, to wit, that\n\nit could reveal intelligence methods.

Giving due deference to\n               \n\nthe agency's determination, we hold that the paragraph is\n\nexempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 3 and 50 U.S.C.\n\n                             -12-\n\n  403(d)(3).

FOIA Exemption 1\n                              \n\n          While our decision under Exemption 3 ends the\n\nmatter, we note that FOIA Exemption 1 leads to the same\n\nresult.  Exemption 1 permits the withholding of matters that\n\nare:\n\n          (1)(A) specifically authorized under\n          criteria established by an Executive\n          order to be kept secret in the interest\n          of national defense or foreign policy and\n          (B) are in fact properly classified\n          pursuant to such Executive order.\n\n5 U.S.C.   552(b)(1).  Executive Order 12356, upon which the\n\nCIA relies, specifically authorizes the withholding of\n\ninformation concerning \"intelligence sources and methods,\"  \n\n                    \n\n6.  We  do not  agree  with the  district  court that  merely\nbecause the information  here is thirty years  old, it cannot\ndetrimentally   reveal   intelligence  sources   or  methods.\nPlaintiff conceded at oral argument before this court that if\nthe withheld information  relates to intelligence sources  or\nmethods,  the   passage  of  thirty  years,   by  itself,  is\ninsufficient  to   require   an  agency   to   disclose   the\ninformation.  Courts have  generally rejected  the contention\nthat  the  mere age  of  intelligence  information rules  out\nExemption  3.   Fitzgibbon, 911  F.2d at 763-64.   Reluctance\n                          \nstems from recognition that it is virtually impossible for an\noutsider  to ascertain what effect the passage of time may or\nmay  not have  had to  mitigate the  harm from  disclosure of\nsources and methods.   Such is true, certainly, as  to events\nthat have occurred  well within the careers of living persons\nincluding governmental leaders (like Cuba's leader) still  in\npower.  The  CIA, not the judiciary, is  better able to weigh\nthe  risks that  disclosure  of such  information may  reveal\nintelligence sources  and methods so as  to endanger national\nsecurity.     Courts  have  accordingly  upheld  pursuant  to\nExemption  3  and 50  U.S.C.    403(d)(3) the  withholding of\ninformation as old as  that sought by plaintiff here.

The\n\nplaintiff did not challenge the excisions under Exemption 6,\n\nrendering unwarranted a Vaughn index at that time.  The State\n                              \n\nDepartment subsequently submitted a declaration, explaining\n\nthat it had withheld names and other identifying information,\n\nsuch as date and place of birth, address and occupation, of\n\npersons other than plaintiff's deceased husband, because\n\n\"disclosure could subject these individuals or their families\n\nto possible embarrassment or harassment.\"  This declaration\n\nfully met any requirement under Vaughn that the State\n                                      \n\nDepartment provide a reasoned justification for its\n\nwithholdings.  Furthermore, the State Department submitted\n\nthe one redacted document to the district court for in camera\n                                                             \n\nreview.\n\n          Finally, in respect to the FBI, the district court\n\ngranted plaintiff's motion for a Vaughn index.  The FBI\n                                       \n\nthereupon submitted two detailed declarations by David R.\n\nLieberman, a special agent in the Freedom of Information-\n\nPrivacy Acts Section of the FBI.  Mr. Lieberman explained\n\nthat the FBI had released twenty-five of forty-four pages of\n\nmaterial to plaintiff, and justified, by means of coded\n\nindices,13 the withholding of information in order to\n\n                    \n\n13.  In  a \"coded\"  format,  an agency  breaks down  its FOIA\nexemptions  into  subcategories,  explains the  nondisclosure\nrationale  for  each  subcategory, and  then  correlates  the\n\n                             -22-\n\nprotect the personal privacy of former FBI agents and third\n\nparties (Exemption 7(C)) and to protect the identities of and\n\ninformation provided by confidential sources (Exemption\n\n7(D)).  Furthermore, as with the CIA and the State\n\nDepartment, the government submitted all of the FBI's\n\ndocuments for in camera review.  The Lieberman declarations\n                       \n\nand coded indices, in conjunction with the district court's\n\nin camera review of the documents, were adequate to meet any\n         \n\nrequirements under Vaughn that the government provide a\n                         \n\nreasoned justification for its withholdings.  See, e.g.,\n                                                       \n\n                    \n\nsubcategories  to each  document  or portion  withheld.   For\nexample, the Lieberman declaration was  accompanied by copies\nof  the documents  in  their redacted  form.   Next  to  each\nredaction was  a code designation that corresponds  to a FOIA\nexemption and  a subcategory  of information.   For instance,\none  of  the  subcategories  for  information  withheld under\nExemption  7(C)  was names  and  initials of  FBI  agents and\nsupport personnel.  A coded symbol (b7C-1) would  appear next\nto  any   deletions  that  fit  within   this  exemption  and\nsubcategory of information.   Use of  coded indices has  been\nexplicitly approved by several circuit courts as long as each\ndeletion is correlated \"specifically and unambiguously to the\ncorresponding  exemption,\"  and the  agency  affidavit places\n\"each   document  into   its  historical   and  investigative\ncontext.\"  See, e.g., Keys v.

Here, the\n                \n\nFBI submitted several declarations of David Lieberman, a\n\nsupervisor in the FOIA section of the FBI's records division,\n\nwho reviewed the information in his official capacity. \n\nSimilarly, the CIA submitted the declarations of John Wright\n\nand Katherine Stricker, the persons responsible for directing\n\nFOIA searches at the CIA and determining the applicability of\n\nFOIA exemptions.  These affidavits, although partly second-\n\nhand, are sufficient to satisfy the government's burden of\n\nsubmitting affidavits of responsible agency officials.\n\n                             -27-\n\n          Plaintiff also makes numerous arguments directed at\n\njust one of the defendant agencies.

E.g., National Metal\n                                                      \n\nFinishing Co. v.

In any case, plaintiff's argument\n\nis contrary to the facts.  The FBI submitted a declaration\n\nexplaining that the \"105, 106\" reference was contained on a\n\n1969 FOIA search slip, not plaintiff's 1987 search slip. \n\nConsequently, the agency did not limit its search for\n\ndocuments responsive to plaintiff's FOIA request to the \"105,\n\n106\" reference.  The district court clearly did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying plaintiff's motion for reconsideration\n\non the basis of the scope of the FBI's search.\n\n          With respect to the CIA, plaintiff complains that\n\nsummary judgment was improper because the CIA's affidavits\n\nwere not sufficiently detailed to enable plaintiff to\n\nchallenge the adequacy of the CIA's search.  Plaintiff\n\nfurther argues that, in any case, it is clear that the CIA's\n\nsearch was inadequate because a 1963 memorandum released to\n\nplaintiff contains a reference to other \"records,\" which have\n\n                             -28-\n\nnot been disclosed.  According to plaintiff, the potential\n\nexistence of other records with no explanation by the CIA for\n\nits failure to produce those other records demonstrates the\n\ninadequacy of the CIA's search for responsive documents.\n\n          Plaintiff's argument regarding the sufficiency of\n\nthe CIA's affidavits is unpersuasive.  The CIA submitted\n\nseveral public declarations by John H. Wright, its\n\nInformation and Privacy Coordinator, explaining that the CIA\n\nconducted two searches    first, of officially released\n\ndocuments15 and, second, of the records of the three\n\nDirectorates where it believed responsive records would be\n\nfound, including the Directorates of Operations (records of\n\nclandestine foreign intelligence and counter intelligence\n\nactivities), Intelligence (records interpreting important\n\nworld events), and Administration (records of employees). \n\nWright's declaration of December 7, 1988 sets forth in a very\n\ngeneral manner the method by which the CIA retrieves\n\ndocuments.16  The Wright declaration further explains that\n\n                    \n\n15.  The search of officially released  documents yielded one\nresponsive document, which was  forwarded to plaintiff.  This\ndocument,  a March 20,  1963 memorandum, states  that the CIA\nhad  no connection with plaintiff's  husband or the flight in\nquestion.\n\n16.  The Wright declaration  explains that the  CIA's records\nsystems are diverse,  decentralized, and compartmentalized in\norder  to  enhance  security   of  documents  by   minimizing\naccidental disclosure of sensitive information.  With respect\nto the CIA's method  of retrieving documents, the declaration\nstates the following:\n\n                             -29-\n\n                    \n\n          3.   The  nature  and  design of  the  CIA  records\n     systems  are determined  by the  nature of  the Agency's\n     intelligence activities and responsibilities.  Documents\n     are generally  retrievable if they  are in a  file which\n     contains a collection of  documents on the same subject,\n     and the subject  is indexed  in a system  that alerts  a\n     searcher to the existence  and location of the file,  or\n     if the document is individually indexed in a system that\n     alerts a searcher  to the document.   If information  is\n     stored  other than  on paper,  it must  be indexed  in a\n     manner which  alerts the  searcher to its  existence and\n     location.     The  manner  in  which   the  CIA  indexes\n     information  for storage  and retrieval  purposes varies\n     according to  the nature  of  the intelligence  activity\n     that the  records are intended to support.   Our ability\n     to  retrieve  data  from   a  given  records  system  is\n     determined by  what information  has been stored  in the\n     system  and how  the  system is  designed for  retrieval\n     purposes.\n          4.   It  is crucial  to note  that the  CIA records\n     storage  processing and  retrieval systems  are designed\n     and programmed to respond to the particular intelligence\n                                                             \n     responsibilities and problems of the component using the\n     system.  For example, a component charged with political\n     analysis of a particular  foreign power may organize its\n     files   under   various  subjects--names   of  prominent\n     politicians, party names, geographical concentrations of\n     power,   etc.    Another  component,  with  a  different\n     intelligence  mission, may set up its files in a totally\n     different   fashion.    Accordingly,  the  structure  of\n     particular records systems are not uniform  but, rather,\n     differ according to the intelligence responsibilities of\n     the component  maintaining the system.   Moreover,  some\n     records  systems  are  such  an  integral  part  of  the\n     associated intelligence activity that the  record system\n     necessarily  bears  the   same  classification  as   the\n     intelligence activity. . . .\n          5.  When Privacy Act and FOIA requests are received\n     in the Information Services  Division (ISD), the initial\n     reception  point  for all such requests  received by the\n     CIA, a determination is made by experienced personnel in\n     ISD as to what components of the Agency might reasonably\n     be expected to possess records which might be responsive\n     to each  request.  Copies  of the requesting  letter are\n     then forwarded to each such component  with instructions\n     that  a search  be  made for  any responsive  documents.\n     This initial step is called \"tasking\" of the components.\n     Searches are then routinely  made among all indices that\n\n                             -30-\n\nsome of the record systems searched in response to\n\nplaintiff's FOIA request are classified.17  According to\n\nWright, \"a detailed discussion would entail the disclosure of\n\nclassified information, including information revealing\n\nintelligence sources and methods.\"  Since public disclosure\n\nof additional details about the CIA's structure and its FOIA\n\nsearch here was not possible, the CIA submitted an in camera\n                                                            \n\ndeclaration detailing the searches conducted by the CIA for\n\nresponsive documents.  After reviewing the public and in\n                                                        \n\n                    \n\n     might logically have any  information relating to .  . .\n     the substance  of  request  under  the FOIA.    In  this\n     regard, it  is necessary  to understand that  the search\n     for  records in  each individual component  is dependent\n     upon  the  component's  unique  indexing  system.    The\n     indices are the source of  any clues into the  existence\n     and location  of responsive  records.  For  example, the\n     indexing   systems   for   records  contained   in   the\n     Directorate of Operations (DO) are not the same as those\n     used in the  Office of  Security (OS).   Therefore,  the\n     search for records in each component must be carried out\n     by an  individual who has knowledge  of that component's\n     indexing system. . . .\n\nThe declaration, however, provides no details as to the CIA's\nsearch for documents responsive to plaintiff's FOIA request.\n\n17.  The National Security Act, 50 U.S.C.   403g, provides in\nrelevant part:\n\n     In  the  interests  of   the  security  of  the  foreign\n     intelligence  activities of  the  United  States and  in\n     order  further  to  implement  the  proviso  of  section\n     403(d)(3)  of this  title that  the Director  of Central\n     Intelligence   shall   be  responsible   for  protecting\n     intelligence  sources  and  methods   from  unauthorized\n     disclosure,  the Agency shall be exempted from . . . the\n     provisions   of  any  other   law  which   requires  the\n     publication   or   disclosure   of   the   organization,\n     functions, names, official titles, salaries,  or numbers\n     of personnel employed by the Agency.\n\n                             -31-\n\ncamera declarations of Mr. Wright, we are satisfied that the\n      \n\nCIA's search was \"reasonably calculated to discover the\n\nrequested documents.\"  See Safecard Servs., 926 F.2d at 1201.\n                                          \n\n          As the CIA has provided relatively detailed\n\naffidavits demonstrating the reasonableness of its search, we\n\nreject plaintiff's argument regarding the 1963 memorandum's\n\nreference to other \"records.\"  As the district court noted,\n\nthe fact a 1963 document refers to the existence of other\n\nrecords does not independently generate an issue of material\n\nfact rendering summary judgment improper so long as\n\nreasonably detailed, nonconclusory affidavits demonstrate the\n\nreasonableness of the agency's search performed in 1990. \n\nSee, e.g., Miller, 779 F.2d at 1385.\n                 \n\n          As to the Customs Service, plaintiff contends that\n\nsummary judgment on the adequacy of the agency's search was\n\nimproper because (1) the Customs Service improperly limited\n\nits search to its automated Treasury Enforcement\n\nCommunications System (\"TECS\"); (2) the declarations\n\nsubmitted by the Customs \n\nService are inconsistent; and (3) the Customs Service did not\n\nsearch possible border crossing records for the period prior\n\nto 1982 because it would involve \"significant effort.\"   \n\n          Plaintiff's first two arguments are interrelated\n\nand neither has any merit.  The Custodian of Records for all\n\nelectronic records, Ellen Mulvenna, submitted three separate\n\n                             -32-\n\ndetailed affidavits explaining the structure of the Customs\n\nService's record systems.  Plaintiff suggests that the\n\nMulvenna declarations are inconsistent because the first\n\ndeclaration states that the original TECS records date back\n\nto the early 1970's and the second declaration states that\n\nall investigatory records, including records in the 1960's,\n\nare included in the TECS.  Contrary to plaintiff's assertion,\n\nthese statements appear to be fully consistent.  According to\n\nthe later Mulvenna affidavits, the TECS system was created in\n\n1970.  At that time, all existing records were placed in the\n\nTECS.  Therefore, as explained in the third Mulvenna\n\naffidavit, the Customs Service's search was appropriately\n\nlimited to the TECS system since \"[a]ny information on\n\nPlaintiff's missing husband that might have been contained in\n\nthe records of the U.S. Customs Service as of the date that\n\nthe TECS system was created in 1970 would have been placed in\n\nthe TECS data system.\"\n\n          Plaintiff's challenge to the adequacy of the\n\nCustoms Service's search is also unpersuasive.  While the\n\ngovernment's declarations acknowledged that a search of\n\nborder crossing data would involve \"significant effort,\" they\n\nalso made clear that such data only exists for dates after\n\n1976, fifteen years after plaintiff's husband disappeared. \n\nIt would seem reasonable, therefore, not to have searched the\n\n                             -33-\n\nborder crossing data, quite apart from any special effort\n\ninvolved.\n\n          Plaintiff's challenges to the State Department's\n\nsearches also lack merit.  Plaintiff complains that (1) the\n\nState Department did not identify who conducted the search or\n\nspecify the background and experience of that person; (2) the\n\nState Department's declaration leaves open the inference that\n\nsome sources that are only 'likely' to contain information\n\nwere not searched; and (3) the declaration does not include a\n\n\"comprehensive listing of 'decentralized record systems.'\"\n\n          There is, however, no general requirement for an\n\nagency to disclose the identity and background of the actual\n\npersons who process FOIA requests.  Plaintiff relies on\n\nWeisberg, 627 F.2d at 371, which reversed a district court's\n        \n\ngrant of summary judgment because the agency affidavits did\n\nnot \"denote which files were searched or by whom, [did] not\n\nreflect any systematic approach to document location, and\n\n[did] not provide information specific enough to enable\n\n[plaintiff] to challenge the procedures utilized.\"  Plaintiff\n\nreads Weisberg too broadly.  See Perry, 684 F.2d at 127\n                                      \n\n(noting that Weisberg \"involved rather special facts that\n                     \n\ntended to cast considerable doubt on the adequacy [of the\n\nagency's search]\" because \"the agency's own assertions\n\nsupported an inference that specifically identified material,\n\nsolicited by the requester, might have remained in the\n\n                             -34-\n\nagency's possession.\").  The point of Weisberg and subsequent\n                                              \n\ncases is that search methods should be ones reasonably\n\ncalculated to locate the requested information, assuming it\n\nexists.  The State Department's declaration suffices to\n\ndemonstrate that its search methods met this standard.18\n\n          Plaintiff's second argument is that the State\n\nDepartment's declaration \"leaves open the inference that some\n\nsources that are only 'likely' to contain information were\n\nnot searched.\"  See Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68 (\"agency cannot\n                           \n\nlimit its search to only one record system if there are\n\nothers that are likely to turn up the information\n\nrequested\").  Plaintiff appears to base this inference upon a\n\nletter from the State Department declaring that it searched\n\nthe two record systems \"most likely to contain the\n                            \n\ninformation\" requested.  However, a subsequent State\n\n                    \n\n18.  The   State   Department's  declaration   explains  that\nresponsive  records,  \"if  they  existed,  would   likely  be\nexpected to be contained in two records systems, namely:  the\nCentral Records; and the Office of Overseas Citizens Services\n[OCS].\"  While name  searches of two of the  three categories\nof Central  Records files (the Automated  Document System and\nthe Lot  Files) turned up  no records, a  name search of  the\n\"personality cross-reference\"  to the Central  Foreign Policy\nFiles  (a  third  category  of  Central  Records)  identified\ntwenty-three responsive documents which  had been sent to the\nOCS  \"for action.\"  The OCS retirement manifests along with a\ndocument-by-document  search revealed that  nineteen of these\ndocuments  \"had been  destroyed in  May, 1979,  in accordance\nwith  approved  disposition  schedules,\" leaving  only  \"four\ndocuments  responsive  to  this   request  [that]  were   not\ndestroyed.\"    Three  of  these documents  were  produced  to\nplaintiff with no excisions, and the fourth was produced with\nminor excisions based on personal privacy grounds pursuant to\nFOIA Exemption 6.\n\n                             -35-\n\nDepartment declaration by its Information and Privacy\n\nCoordinator, Frank M. Machak, declared that searches were\n\nconducted of all \"record systems\" that were \"likely\" to\n\ncontain the information requested.\n\n          Finally, plaintiff's demand for a \"comprehensive\n\nlisting of 'decentralized records systems'\" is also\n\nunfounded.  \"There is no requirement that an agency search\n\nevery record system.\"  Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68.  Nor is there\n                              \n\nany requirement that an agency provide a comprehensive list\n\nof record systems unlikely to contain responsive records. \n\nRather, an agency need only provide \"[a] reasonably detailed\n\naffidavit, setting forth the search terms and the type of\n\nsearch performed, and averring that all files likely to\n\ncontain responsive materials . . . were searched,\" see, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nid., as well as a general description of the structure of the\n   \n\nagency's file system demonstrating why further search would\n\nbe overly burdensome, see Church of Scientology of Cal., 792\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 151.  Because the State Department's affidavits fully\n\nmeet this standard, summary judgment on the adequacy of the\n\nState Department's search was inappropriate.19\n\n                    \n\n19.  Plaintiff  also suggests,  without  further argument  or\nexplanation, that  the State Department should  have searched\nthe records of the  \"Cuba Desk\" and the \"Bureau  of Politico-\nMilitary  Affairs.\"   Plaintiff's suggestion  seems factually\nmisguided.   It appears that  the records of  the \"Cuba Desk\"\n(the  formal name for which is apparently the Office of Cuban\nAffairs  in  the  Bureau   of  Inter-American  Affairs)  were\nsearched.   The Bureau  of Politico-Military Affairs,  on the\nother hand,  is apparently concerned with  remote issues such\n\n                             -36-\n\n          With respect to the DIA's search, plaintiff\n\ncontends that summary judgement was inappropriate because (1)\n\na document that was forwarded from the FBI to the DIA in 1963\n\nwas not located by the DIA in its 1990 search; and (2) the\n\nDIA's declaration does not adequately explain the data bases\n\nsearched or the procedures for information retrieval.\n\n          As to plaintiff's first argument, \"the fact that a\n\ndocument once existed does not mean that it now exists; nor\n\ndoes the fact that an agency created a document necessarily\n\nimply that the agency has retained it.\"  Miller, 779 F.2d at\n                                               \n\n1385.  Thus the failure of the DIA to produce a copy of a\n\ndocument, identified in a 1963 memo, does not mean that the\n\nDIA's search in 1990 was inadequate, particularly when the\n\nDIA has demonstrated that its 1990 search was reasonably\n\ncalculated to uncover responsive documents.  Plaintiff's\n\nsecond contention also lacks merit.  The DIA's declaration\n\nadequately explains the two data bases it searched. \n\nAccording to the DIA's declaration, the Central Reference\n\nDivision of the DIA Directorate for Technical Services and\n\nSupport \"searched its two data bases:  the Intelligence\n\nReport Index Summary Archive (IRISA) and the All Source\n\nDocument Index Archive (ASDIA).\"  IRISA \"contains\n\n                    \n\nas arms control, nuclear  non-proliferation, outer space  and\nthe  coordination of military-related activities with foreign\npolicy.    The records  of  the  Bureau of  Politico-Military\nAffairs, therefore,  seem unlikely to  contain any responsive\ndocuments.\n\n                             -37-\n\nbibliographic references to all human intelligence\n\ninformation reports held or produced by DIA.\"  ASDIA\n\n\"contains bibliographic citations to all intelligence\n\nstudies, contract reports, open source materials maintained\n\nin the DIA library.\"  These two data bases, therefore,\n\nincluded all materials maintained by the DIA that were likely\n\nto contain responsive documents.  A search of these two data\n\nbases failed to produce any information pertaining to\n\nplaintiff's husband.  While the DIA's declaration could have\n\ndescribed the actual search conducted in more detail, any\n\n\"arguable inadequacy of the search descriptions\" is \"no more\n\nthan marginal and does not render the grant of summary\n\njudgment appropriate.\"  See Perry, 684 F.2d at 127.\n                                 \n\n          Finally, plaintiff contends that the INS's search\n\nwas inadequate because it took seventeen months to locate a\n\nresponsive file and because the file was lost in 1985 and not\n\nfound and turned over to plaintiff until after her appeal was\n\ntaken in 1992.  Neither of these arguments is persuasive. \n\nPlaintiff's first contention was raised initially in an\n\nuntimely motion for reconsideration.  Therefore, we review\n\nthe district court's denial of this motion only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.  See, e.g., National Metal Finishing Co., 899\n                                                    \n\nF.2d at 125.  Delay in locating a document \"is significant\n\nonly to the extent that evidence shows that the delay\n\nresulted from bad faith refusal to cooperate.\"  Miller, 779\n                                                      \n\n                             -38-\n\nF.2d at 1386; accord Perry, 684 F.2d at 128 (court upholds\n                          \n\nadequacy of agency search notwithstanding delay of over one\n\nand one half years); Goland, 607 F.2d at 355 (agency delay,\n                           \n\nby itself, is not indicative of lack of good faith).  Because\n\nplaintiff presented no evidence to suggest that the\n\nseventeen-month delay resulted from bad faith, the district\n\ncourt properly denied plaintiff's untimely motion for\n\nreconsideration.  \n\n          Plaintiff's second argument fares no better. \n\nEssentially, plaintiff argues that the fact that a file was\n\nlost and then found undercuts the DIA's contention that its\n\nsearch was reasonable.  See Goland, 607 F.2d at 369-70.  In\n                                  \n\nGoland, one week after the D.C. Circuit affirmed a district\n      \n\ncourt's conclusion that the CIA had conducted an adequate\n\nsearch, see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"370469\"><a href=\"/opinion/370469/susan-d-goland-and-patricia-b-skidmore-v-central-intelligence-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">607</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 1978), the CIA informed\n           \n\nthe Justice Department that it had discovered additional\n\ndocuments responsive to the plaintiff's FOIA request while\n\nthe appeal had been pending.  Although some of these\n\ndocuments were subsequently released to the plaintiff, the\n\nplaintiff sought to have the D.C. Circuit reconsider its\n\nopinion as to the adequacy of the CIA's search, arguing that\n\nthe discovery of additional documents undercut the finding\n\nthat the search had been reasonable.  The D.C. Circuit\n\nrejected the argument, stating that \"[t]he issue was not\n\nwhether any further documents might conceivably exist but\n\n                             -39-\n\nwhether [the agency's] search for responsive documents was\n\nadequate.\"  607 F.2d at 369-70.  Although the court noted\n\nthat the discovery of additional documents may be evidence\n\nthat a search is not thorough, the court was satisfied that\n\n\"the original failure to uncover the documents was wholly\n\nunderstandable and not inconsistent with the district court's\n\nfinding that the search was thorough.\"  Id. at 370, 372; see\n                                                            \n\nalso Miller, 779 F.2d at 1386 (discovery of additional\n           \n\ndocuments is not conclusive of agency bad faith since belated\n\ndiscovery may result merely from administrative inefficiency\n\nor reluctant diligence on the part of the agency); Perry, 684\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 128 (discovery of additional documents indicated\n\n\"neither artifice nor subterfuge but rather, at worse (sic),\n\nadministrative inefficiency.\").  \n\n          Similarly here, the INS submitted a declaration to\n\nthe district court, explaining that the three-page document\n\nresponsive to plaintiff's FOIA request was lost in transit\n\nfrom the Federal Records Center in Atlanta to the INS Central\n\nOffice in Washington, D.C.  More important, the INS submitted\n\nan additional declaration detailing the extensive steps taken\n\nby the INS to locate the missing file, including computer and\n\nmanual shelf-by-shelf searches.  In light of the detailed\n\naffidavits demonstrating the adequacy of the INS's initial\n\nsearch and the subsequent search for the missing file, we are\n\nnot persuaded that the district court was incorrect in\n\n                             -40-\n\nconcluding that the searches were reasonable and in good\n\nfaith.  Instead, the agency's initial inability to find the\n\nmissing file appears to be the result of administrative\n\ninefficiency.  Nor can we say that the agency's subsequent\n\ndiscovery and release of the lost file impugns the integrity\n\nof the INS's affidavits.  Rather than bad faith, we think the\n\nforthright disclosure by the INS that it had located the\n\nmisplaced file suggests good faith on the part of the agency. \n\nSee Meeropol, 790 F.2d at 953 (\"what is expected of a law-\n            \n\nabiding agency is that it admit and correct error when error\n\nis revealed.\").\n\n          In sum, we are satisfied, as was the district\n\ncourt, that each defendant agency presented reasonably\n\ndetailed, nonconclusory affidavits demonstrating the\n\nreasonableness of their respective searches.  We reject\n\nplaintiff's suggestion that the agencies' affidavits were\n\ninsufficient to support summary judgment on the issue of the\n\nadequacy of the agencies' searches.\n\n          D.  FOIA Exemptions\n                             \n\n          Plaintiff contends that the district court\n\nimproperly upheld the FBI's withholding of information under\n\nFOIA Exemption 6 and asks us to join all other defendants in\n\nthis argument.  Exemption 6 permits withholding of the\n\nfollowing:\n\n          personnel and medical files and similar\n          files the disclosure of which would\n\n                             -41-\n\n          constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion\n          of personal privacy.\n\n5 U.S.C.   552(b)(6).  \n\n          It is not surprising that plaintiff was unable to\n\nfind any justification under Exemption 6 for the FBI's\n\nexcisions since the FBI did not claim Exemption 6 as the\n\nbasis of its withholding.  Rather, it claimed Exemption\n\n7(C),20 which permits the withholding of\n\n          records or information compiled for law\n          enforcement purposes,  but only to the\n          extent that the production of such law\n          enforcement records or information . . .\n          (C) could reasonably be expected to\n          constitute an unwarranted invasion of\n          personal privacy.\n\n5 U.S.C.   552(b)(7)(C).\n\n          In analyzing Exemption 7(C) claims, courts balance\n\n\"privacy\" interests against any \"public interest\" in\n\ndisclosure.

Accordingly, plaintiff's claim for disclosure fails\n\nunder Exemption 7(C).\n\n          Plaintiff's claim for disclosure fits no better\n\nwithin Exemption 6.  The only agency actually to rely on\n\nExemption 6 for any withholdings is the State Department.  In\n\nits declaration, the State Department explained that it had\n\n                    \n\n21.  For the same reason,  the effect of the passage  of time\nupon the individual's privacy  interests is simply irrelevant\nwhen  a  FOIA  requestor  is  unable  to  suggest  any public\ninterest in  the disclosure of  names that would  reveal what\nthe  government is up to.   Privacy interests,  no matter how\nminimal,  will outweigh  a nonexistent  public interest.   We\ntherefore reject  plaintiff's suggestion that the  FBI should\nhave considered  \"the mitigation  of time\" on  documents over\ntwenty-five years old.\n\n                             -44-\n\nwithheld the names and other identifying information (i.e.,\n                                                          \n\ndate and place of birth, address and occupation), because\n\ndisclosure could subject individuals or their families to\n\nharassment or embarrassment, and the public interest in\n\ndisclosure, if any, was minimal.  This characterization seems\n\nentirely justified.  \n\n          As with Exemption 7(C), courts must balance the\n\nrelative privacy and public interests to determine whether\n\ninformation is properly withheld under Exemption 6.

The district court was within its discretion in\n\nconcluding that plaintiff had not substantially prevailed,\n\nand did not abuse its discretion by refusing to reconsider\n\nthis decision.\n\n                             II.\n\n          The district court's order of November 14, 1990\n\ncompelling the CIA to disclose the third full paragraph on\n\npage 2 of the December 22, 1961 memorandum is reversed.\n                                                      \n\n          The district court's subsequent orders granting\n\nsummary judgment to the CIA, the FBI, the State Department,\n\nthe Customs Service, the INS, and the DIA, as well as its\n\ndecision not to award attorney's fees, are all affirmed.\n                                                       \n\n          So ordered.
