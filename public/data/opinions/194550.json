Beauchamp,  appeals from his\n\nconviction  in  the  United  States District  Court  for  the\n\nDistrict of Rhode Island for uttering and publishing a forged\n\nUnited  States Treasury  check  and for  aiding and  abetting\n\nothers  in uttering and publishing the  check in violation of\n\n18  U.S.C.   510(a)(2) and 2.  Defendant raises two arguments\n\non appeal:  (1)  the district court abused its  discretion by\n\nrefusing  to allow defendant  to present testimony impeaching\n\nthe  credibility  of a  witness; and  (2) the  district court\n\nclearly erred  in concluding  that the offense  involved more\n\nthan  minimal  planning   under  U.S.S.G.     2F1.1(b)(2)(A).\n\nFinding no error, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n          On  December  4, 1991,  defendant was  indicted and\n\ncharged with uttering and  publishing a forged treasury check\n\nand aiding and abetting others in uttering and publishing the\n\ncheck  in violation of  18 U.S.C.    510(a)(2) and 2.   After\n\ndefendant's  first  trial  ended  in  a  mistrial,  the  case\n\nproceeded to trial again on May 18, 1992.  \n\n          The  evidence indicated  that on  May 4,  1990, the\n\nInternal  Revenue Service  mailed a tax  refund check  in the\n\namount of $2006.20 to Francisca and Domingo Franco of Central\n\nFalls, Rhode Island.  The Francos never received their check.\n\nInstead, on  May 17,  1990, defendant deposited  the Francos'\n\n                             -3-\n\nrefund check in  a checking  account he had  opened two  days\n\nearlier at a Fleet Bank branch in Lincoln, Rhode Island.  The\n\nback of  the refund check  was endorsed \"Domingo  Franco\" and\n\n\"Francisco  (sic) D.  Franco.\"  Underneath  the endorsements,\n\nwhich were forged, defendant signed his own name and address.\n\nNo other deposits were  made to the account, which  reached a\n\nzero balance  on June  5, 1990.   The account  was closed  on\n\nJuly 16, 1990.\n\n          In May of 1991, the Providence office of the United\n\nStates Secret  Service began an  investigation into  possible\n\nfraud  in the negotiation of  the Francos' refund  check.  As\n\ndefendant's name and address  were on the back of  the check,\n\nSpecial  Agent  Rudolph  Rivera  contacted  him.    Defendant\n\nadmitted to having signed his name  on the back of the check,\n\nbut stated that  he had been  handed the check by  a Hispanic\n\nman as partial payment for a car.  According to defendant, an\n\nacquaintance  of his,  named Joseph  Massey, had  brought the\n\nHispanic  man to defendant to buy the car.  Defendant claimed\n\nthat  the Hispanic man had identified himself as the payee on\n\nthe refund check.\n\n          Special  Agent Rivera  obtained from  the defendant\n\nexemplars of the  defendant's handwriting.   After  examining\n\nthese,  Rivera  concluded  that  defendant's  handwriting was\n\ndissimilar from the forged signatures.\n\n                             -4-\n\n          In late July, 1991, Fleet  Bank contacted Detective\n\nWilliam   Carnes  of  the   Lincoln,  Rhode   Island,  Police\n\nDepartment concerning  the Francos'  refund check.   After an\n\ninterview  with  defendant in  which  defendant repeated  his\n\nstory with minor variations, defendant, Detective Carnes, and\n\nanother police officer traveled to Central Falls in search of\n\nthe Hispanic  man to  whom defendant  had allegedly sold  the\n\ncar,  as well as to Union Avenue  in Providence to search for\n\nan \"Italian guy\" who allegedly had sold the car to defendant.\n\nTheir  search was  unsuccessful.   Detective  Carnes  located\n\nJoseph  Massey and  obtained Massey's  agreement to  speak to\n\nSpecial Agent Rivera about the case.  In a written statement,\n\nMassey corroborated defendant's story about the Hispanic man.\n\n          After federal investigators  recontacted Massey  in\n\nFebruary  1992,  Massey  admitted  that   his  prior  written\n\nstatement was false.   Massey testified for the government at\n\ntrial.   He admitted on  direct examination that  he had been\n\nconvicted once  for forging  a welfare  check  and twice  for\n\nlarceny  of a motor vehicle.  Massey testified that on August\n\n1, 1991,  defendant went  to Massey's wife's  house and  told\n\nMassey that  he was in  trouble about a  check.  During  this\n\nconversation, defendant  asked Massey to tell  the police the\n\nstory  about the  Hispanic  man.   Massey  agreed because  he\n\nbelieved defendant was threatening him.\n\n                             -5-\n\n          Defendant  was  denied  permission  to  call  as  a\n\nwitness Zelmare Amaral, the landlady of 101 Carpenter Street,\n\nPawtucket, Rhode Island.   Defendant sought to introduce Mrs.\n\nAmaral's  testimony primarily  to impeach  Massey's testimony\n\nthat  he lived  at the  101 Carpenter  Street address.   Mrs.\n\nAmaral had testified at the first trial that Massey's brother\n\nand  sister, not  Massey,  resided at  101 Carpenter  Street,\n\nalthough  she acknowledged  having  seen Massey  there.   The\n\ncourt  would  not  allow   Mrs.  Amaral  to  testify,  saying\n\ndefendant was merely  seeking to  impeach Massey  on a  \"very\n\ncollateral\" matter.\n\n          The jury  returned a  guilty verdict and  defendant\n\nwas  sentenced  to  11  months  imprisonment.    This  appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                             II.\n\n     A.  Impeachment on Collateral Matters\n                                          \n\n          Defendant  contends the  district court  abused its\n\ndiscretion  when it  precluded  Mrs. Amaral  from taking  the\n\nstand to contradict Massey's  testimony that he lived  at 101\n\nCarpenter  Street.     Defendant  points  to   Supreme  Court\n\nauthority  that a  defendant is  entitled to  cross-examine a\n\nwitness  as to  his or her  name and  address.   See Smith v.\n                                                          \n\nIllinois, 390 U.S. 129, 131  (1968); Alford v. United States,\n                                                            \n\n282  U.S. 687, 693 (1931).   Defendant concedes,  as he must,\n\nthat the district court permitted him to cross-examine Massey\n\n                             -6-\n\non his address.  Defendant contends,  however, that the value\n\nof his  right to ask Massey where he lives for the purpose of\n\n\"exposing falsehood\" is vastly diminished if defendant cannot\n\nalso present extrinsic evidence demonstrating that Massey has\n\nlied.   Defendant additionally argues that,  quite apart from\n\nthe value  of Mrs. Amaral's  testimony to  impeach Massey  by\n\ncontradiction, the proffered testimony was relevant to expose\n\nMassey's motive to testify falsely.  We find neither argument\n\npersuasive.\n\n          It is well established that a party may not present\n\nextrinsic evidence to impeach a witness by contradiction on a\n\ncollateral matter.1  E.g., United  States v. Pisari, 636 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n                    \n\n1.  The government  argues  that Mrs.  Amaral's testimony  is\nbarred by Rule 608(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which\nexpressly precludes  the use of extrinsic  evidence solely to\nimpeach a witness's credibility.  The rule states in relevant\npart:  \"Specific instances  of the conduct of a  witness, for\nthe  purpose  of   attacking  or   supporting  the   witness'\ncredibility, other  than conviction  of crime as  provided in\nrule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\"  Like the\ngeneral rule barring the use of extrinsic evidence to impeach\na witness  on a collateral matter  through contradiction, the\npurpose of Rule 608(b)'s prohibition of extrinsic evidence is\nto  avoid  holding mini-trials  on  irrelevant or  collateral\nmatters.  E.g.,  United States v.  Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d  632,\n                                             \n641-42 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 956  (1980); United\n                                                             \nStates  v. Martz, 964 F.2d 787, 789 (8th Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n61 U.S.L.W. 3435 (1992).  In the present context, however, it\nis difficult to conceptualize the actual location of Massey's\nresidence as  being a  \"specific instance of  conduct\" within\nthe  meaning of Rule 608(b).  See United States v. Tarantino,\n                                                            \n846  F.2d  1384,  1409  (D.C. Cir.)  (Rule  608(b)  addresses\nconduct indicative  of untruthfulness, such as fraudulent and\ndishonest  behavior),  cert.  denied,  488  U.S. 867  (1988);\n                                    \nUnited  States v. Opager, 589  F.2d 799, 801  (5th Cir. 1979)\n                        \n(same).   Like the district court, we think guidance is to be\nfound in the more general rule as to collateral matters.\n\n                             -7-\n\n855, 859  (1st Cir. 1981);  1 McCormack on Evidence    45, at\n                                                   \n\n169  (4th ed.  1992).   Thus, it  is often  said that  when a\n\nwitness testifies to a  collateral matter, the examiner \"must\n\ntake [the] answer,\" i.e., the examiner may not disprove it by\n\nextrinsic evidence.   E.g., United States v.  Martz, 964 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n787,  789 (8th Cir.), cert. denied,  61 U.S.L.W. 3435 (1992);\n                                  \n\nUnited States v. Young, 952 F.2d 1252, 1259 (10th Cir. 1991);\n                      \n\n1 McCormack on Evidence   45, at 170.  A matter is considered\n                       \n\ncollateral  if \"the  matter  itself is  not  relevant in  the\n\nlitigation  to establish  a  fact of  consequence, i.e.,  not\n\nrelevant for a  purpose other than mere contradiction  of the\n\nin-court testimony of the witness.\"   1 McCormack on Evidence\n                                                             \n\n   45, at  169.   Stated another  way, extrinsic  evidence to\n\ndisprove  a fact testified to by a witness is admissible when\n\nit satisfies the Rule 403 balancing test and is not barred by\n\nany  other rule of evidence.  See United States v. Tarantino,\n                                                            \n\n846   F.2d   1384,   1409   (D.C.   Cir.)   (\"The   'specific\n\ncontradiction' rule .  . .  is a particular  instance of  the\n\ntrial  court's  general  power under  Fed.  R.  Evid. 403  to\n\nexclude  evidence 'if  its probative  value is  substantially\n\noutweighed . . . by considerations of undue delay, [or] waste\n\nof time.'\"),  cert. denied, 488 U.S. 867  (1988); Pisari, 636\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 858;  3 Weinstein's Evidence, 607[5],  at 607-79, -80\n                                    \n\n(1992).  To the extent Mrs. Amaral's testimony merely went to\n\n                             -8-\n\nMassey's credibility by  demonstrating a contradiction on  an\n\nimmaterial matter, it was clearly excludible.\n\n          Defendant  contends that  testimony as  to Massey's\n\nresidence  was not  merely collateral,  but was  relevant and\n\nadmissible  for a  purpose  other  than  impeaching  Massey's\n\ngeneral character for  truthfulness or untruthfulness through\n\ncontradiction.  According  to defendant, Massey's  insistence\n\nthat he lived at 101 Carpenter Street in Pawtucket and not at\n\nhis  wife's house on Pine Street in Central Falls, could have\n\nbeen viewed as an attempt to distance himself from the forged\n\ncheck,  which  had originally  been  mailed  to the  Francos'\n\nresidence in Central Falls.  According to defendant, Massey's\n\nalleged falsehood concerning his  residence would thus expose\n\na motive  to shift  culpability for  stealing the  check from\n\nhimself to defendant.  \n\n          But  while a witness's  self-interest or  motive to\n\ntestify  falsely  is  generally   considered  to  be  a  non-\n\ncollateral issue, United States  v. Rios Ruiz, 579 F.2d  670,\n                                             \n\n673  (1st Cir. 1978) (bias); United States v. Calle, 822 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1016, 1021 (11th Cir. 1987) (self-interest in testifying), we\n\nthink the  district court was  entitled to conclude  that the\n\n\"marginal relevance\" of Mrs. Amaral's  proposed testimony was\n\noutweighed  by  the \"time  and  effort\"  it would  entail  to\n\npresent  this testimony.  As noted by the district judge, who\n\npresided   over  defendant's   first  trial,   Mrs.  Amaral's\n\n                             -9-\n\ntestimony  was  inconclusive.     She   testified  that   she\n\noccasionally  saw Massey,  a truck  driver, at  101 Carpenter\n\nStreet,  but  that his  brother  and  sister paid  the  rent.\n\nMoreover, as the district  court noted, Pawtucket is adjacent\n\nto  Central Falls;  therefore,  whether Massey  lived at  his\n\nsiblings'  house in Pawtucket or his  wife's house in Central\n\nFalls said little about  Massey's personal involvement in the\n\ncrime, particularly since  there had  already been  testimony\n\nthat  Massey spent  at  least some  time  at both  locations.\n\nUnder  the circumstances,  we  cannot say  that the  district\n\ncourt  abused  its  discretion  in  excluding  Mrs.  Amaral's\n\nproposed  testimony concerning  whether Massey  lived  at 101\n\nCarpenter Street.\n\n     B.  More Than Minimal Planning\n                                   \n\n          Defendant  next  argues  that  the  district  court\n\nclearly erred when it  increased defendant's offense level by\n\ntwo levels, having determined  that his offense involved more\n\nthan  minimal  planning   under  U.S.S.G.     2F1.1(b)(2)(A).\n\nSection  2F1.1(b)(2)(A),  which  governs  offenses  involving\n\nfraud or deceit, states that if an offense involves more than\n\nminimal planning,  the offense  level should be  increased by\n\ntwo  levels.   Application  Note  1(f) of  the  commentary to\n\nU.S.S.G.    1B1.1 defines what constitutes  more than minimal\n\nplanning.  It states, in part, the following:\n\n          \"More than minimal planning\"  also exists\n          if  significant  affirmative  steps  were\n\n                             -10-\n\n          taken  to conceal the offense, other than\n          conduct to which    3C1.1 (Obstructing or\n          Impeding  the Administration  of Justice)\n          applies.\n\nRelying  on  the  above-quoted passage,  the  district  court\n\nenhanced  defendant's  offense level  for  more  than minimal\n\nplanning  on the  basis  of defendant's  attempts to  mislead\n\ninvestigators  with his false story    which he got Massey to\n\ncorroborate     about a Hispanic man.  We review the district\n\ncourt's enhancement  for more than minimal  planning only for\n\nclear  error.  E.g., United States v. Gregorio, 956 F.2d 341,\n                                              \n\n343 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          On appeal, both  parties focus  their arguments  on\n\nwhether  the  \"significant  affirmative  steps\"   to  conceal\n\nmentioned in    1B1.1, Application Note 1(f), must take place\n\nbefore  a defendant  commits  an offense  for an  enhancement\n      \n\nunder    2F1.1(b)(2)(A) to  apply.  Defendant  argues that in\n\norder for  the more than  minimal planning enhancement  to be\n\napplied   based   on   significant   affirmative   steps   of\n\nconcealment,  there  must be  evidence  that  the steps  were\n\nplanned  or at least contemplated prior  to the commission of\n\nthe offense.   The  government, on  the other hand,  contends\n\nthat  significant steps to  conceal an  offense after  it has\n                                                     \n\nbeen  committed will  warrant  an enhancement  for more  than\n\nminimal planning.\n\n          In  arguing that  there  most  be some  pre-offense\n\nplanning,  defendant  relies primarily  on  United  States v.\n                                                          \n\n                             -11-\n\nMaciaga, 965  F.2d 404 (7th  Cir. 1992).  In  Maciaga, a bank\n                                                     \n\nsecurity  guard stole  a bag  of cash  from the  bank's night\n\ndeposit safe.   To deflect suspicion from  himself, the guard\n\ntold  investigating  authorities  that  he  had  been  having\n\nproblems with night deposit bags becoming stuck in the chute.\n\nThe sentencing  judge enhanced the guard's  sentence for more\n\nthan minimal  planning, finding that the  false statements to\n\ninvestigators  constituted  significant affirmative  steps to\n\nconceal  the  larceny.   In  reversing  the enhancement,  the\n\nSeventh Circuit  noted that \"[w]hen the  enhancement has been\n\napplied because  a defendant  has taken significant  steps to\n\nconceal the offense, evidence of some pre-offense planning of\n                                                             \n\nthe concealment  has been present.\"   Id. at 407.   The court\n                                         \n\nthen  held  that the  guard's  false  story to  investigators\n\namounted to no more than the \"'logical' step  of discouraging\n\nan investigation,\"  and did not constitute  more than minimal\n\nplanning.  Id. at 408.\n              \n\n          We  are  unwilling  to go  so  far  as  the Seventh\n\nCircuit in  requiring direct evidence of pre-offense planning\n\nof   the   concealment.      It   is   true   that   U.S.S.G.\n\n  2F1.1(b)(2)(A)  indicates  that  the  offense  itself  must\n\n\"involve\" more than minimal planning.  We recognize there may\n\nbe   situations  where  a   defendant's  subsequent  cover-up\n\nactivity is  so disassociated from  the earlier  crime as  to\n\nmake it unreasonable to find that the crime itself \"involved\"\n\n                             -12-\n\nmore than minimal planning.  But we believe the determination\n\nis essentially one of fact for the district court.  Crimes of\n\nfraud  and deceit  by their  very nature  may, and  often do,\n\ncompel, quite predictably, later efforts at a cover-up.  Thus\n\ndefendant here, having put his name and address on the check,\n\nknew  that   he  would   probably  be  later   questioned  by\n\nauthorities, at which time he would necessarily have to offer\n\nsome  innocent explanation.   It is not  unreasonable to view\n\nthe false story he  eventually told, and the elaborate  steps\n\nhe  took to support it,  as integral to  the original offense\n\nitself,  so that  the offense  can properly  be said  to have\n\n\"involved\" this later cover-up activity.  That interpretation\n\nis the one most consistent with Application Note 1(f),  which\n\nexpressly includes within \"[m]ore than minimal planning . . .\n\nsignificant  affirmative steps  .  . . taken  to conceal  the\n\noffense.\"    The  application  notes,  while not  conclusive,\n\ndemand considerable deference.   United States v. Weston, 960\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 212, 218 (1st Cir. 1992).  We are less ready, therefore,\n\nthan  the Maciaga court to require direct proof of \"some pre-\n                 \n\noffense  planning of  the  concealment\" where,  as here,  the\n\nnecessity to  conceal was so  integral to the  entire scheme.\n\nMaciaga, 965 F.2d at 407 (emphasis deleted).\n       \n\n          In the instant case, moreover, defendant's cover-up\n\nwas far  more elaborate and  better planned than  in Maciaga.\n                                                            \n\nHe did not merely \"take the 'logical' step of discouraging an\n\n                             -13-\n\ninvestigation\" by telling a  false story to police.   See id.\n                                                             \n\nat 408.   Rather,  defendant recruited a  friend, Massey,  to\n\ncorroborate his own false story by repeating the same tale to\n\ninvestigators.   Defendant also took investigators  on a wild\n\ngoose  chase  throughout the  streets  of  Central Falls  and\n\nProvidence, searching  for the mythical Italian  man who sold\n\nhim  the car and the  elusive Hispanic man  to whom defendant\n\nallegedly  sold  the  car.     These  additional  steps  make\n\ndefendant's attempted concealment much more \"significant\" and\n\n\"affirmative\"  than  those taken  by  the  security guard  in\n\nMaciaga.   Under such  circumstances, we cannot  say that the\n       \n\ndistrict  court   clearly  erred  in   enhancing  defendant's\n\nsentence for  more than  minimal planning, regardless  of the\n\nlack of any  direct evidence  that the cover  story had  been\n\nplanned prior to the offense.2\n\n                    \n\n2.  This conclusion is further buttressed by the reference in\nApplication   Note  1(f)  to   the  obstruction   of  justice\nenhancement,  U.S.S.G.     3C1.1.     Application  Note  1(f)\nexpressly  provides that  significant  affirmative  steps  to\nconceal will not constitute more than minimal planning when  \n3C1.1 applies  to the conduct.  We  think this reference to  \n3C1.1   reflects   implicit   recognition  that   significant\naffirmative  post-offense steps  to conceal  can,  in certain\ncircumstances,  constitute either more  than minimal planning\nunder    2F1.1(b)(2)(A) or an  obstruction of justice under  \n3C1.1.   As the district  court recognized, the  exclusion in\nApplication  Note 1(f) of conduct to which   3C1.1 applies is\nintended to avoid  the double counting  that would result  if\ncourts treated the same post-offense concealment as both more\nthan minimal planning and obstruction of justice.  See United\n                                                             \nStates v. Werlinger, 894  F.2d 1015, 1016-17 (8th  Cir. 1990)\n                   \n(defendant's  attempt to  recruit  co-workers  to tell  false\nstory  to auditors  of bank  constituted further  attempts to\nconceal his embezzlement and, therefore, could not constitute\n\n                             -14-\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                              Concurrence     and     Dissent\n\nfollows.\n\n                    \n\nan obstruction of justice under   3C1.1).\n     Insofar as  our dissenting  colleague suggests  that the\ncover-up  here falls  exclusively  within the  definition  of\nobstructing  justice,   we  note   that,  according   to  the\ngovernment, defendant's conduct  would not have  been covered\nby   3C1.1, since it did not significantly impede or obstruct\nthe  official investigation  or prosecution  of  the offense.\nU.S.S.G.     3C1.1,  Application  Note  3(g).   It  was  not,\ntherefore,  \"conduct to which    3C1.1 . .  . applies,\" quite\napart  from  the  fact   that  defendant  was  never  charged\nthereunder and double-counting was never a question.\n\n                             -15-\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring and dissenting:\n                            \n\n          I agree with the court  that the district judge did\n\nnot abuse his discretion in excluding Mrs. Amaral's proffered\n\ntestimony.  Regretfully,  I cannot agree with  my brothers in\n\napproving a two-level increase in the offense level  based on\n\na  finding that there was  more than minimal  planning by the\n\ndefendant.  This ruling is  contrary to the guideline  itself\n\nas well as common sense and logic.\n\n           A  sentencing  increase  for  \"more  than  minimal\n\nplanning\" under  U.S.S.G.     2F1.1(b)(2)  based  upon  post-\n\noffense  conduct is  an  issue of  first  impression in  this\n\ncircuit.  Previously,  when we have  found more than  minimal\n\nplanning for purposes of approving a sentencing increase, the\n\noffense  itself  involved significant  planning.   See, e.g.,\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v.  Resurreccion, 978 F.2d  759, 763 (1st  Cir.\n                              \n\n1992)   (transporting  forged  securities   into  the  United\n\nStates); United States  v. Rust,  976 F.2d 55,  57 (1st  Cir.\n                               \n\n1992)   (falsifying  many   travel  vouchers   submitted  for\n\nreimbursement  to the State of Massachusetts over a four year\n\nperiod);  United States  v.

In  this case,\n\nneither the  district court nor  the majority found  that the\n\ndefendant's offense,  forging the  payees' names on  a stolen\n\ncheck and then  writing his own name and address on the check\n\nin  order to  deposit  it in  a  newly-created bank  account,\n\nrequired  more than  minimal planning.3   The  district court\n\nenhanced the defendant's offense  level based on his attempts\n\nto  mislead investigators  long  after the  offense had  been\n\ncommitted.\n\n          The guideline  provides  for a  two-level  increase\n\n\"[i]f the offense involved (A) more than minimal planning[.]\"\n\nU.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b)(2).   The application notes following the\n\nguideline  refer  to  the  Commentary  to     1B1.1,  General\n\nApplication  Principles,  for the  definition  of  \"more than\n\nminimal planning.\"  As  the  majority  noted, the  commentary\n\nexplains that,  \"'More than minimal planning'  also exists if\n\nsignificant affirmative  steps  were  taken  to  conceal  the\n\n                    \n\n3.     The presentence report  prepared by  the Rhode  Island\nprobation  department recommended the  two-level increase for\n\"more  than   minimal  planning\"   pursuant  to   U.S.S.G.   \n2F1.1(b)(2)  based on conduct of the offense:  opening a bank\naccount to  deposit the  stolen check, depositing  the check,\nwithdrawing  all of  the funds, and  never using  the account\nagain.   Defense  counsel  objected, and  the district  court\nagreed that the conduct relied upon in the presentence report\ndid not constitute \"more  than minimal planning.\"   The court\nwent on  to find, however,  that the defendant's  false story\nafter the  offense involved \"more than  minimal planning\" and\nimposed the two-level increase based on that finding.\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\noffense, other  than conduct to which   3C1.1 (Obstructing or\n\nImpeding the Administration of  Justice) applies.\"   U.S.S.G.\n\n  1B1.1, Application Note 1(f).   Reading the definition into\n\nthe guideline, it seems clear to me that the focus remains on\n\nconduct  preceding and  involving the  offense.   Attempts to\n\nconceal the  offense, which are  planned and occur  after the\n\noffense, fall  within the definition of  obstructing justice,\n\nand  should not be  considered for  purposes of  a sentencing\n\nincrease  for \"more  than minimal  planning.\"4   The majority\n\npoints  out  correctly  that  in this  case  the  defendant's\n\nconcocted story did not  significantly impede or obstruct the\n\nofficial  investigation  or  prosecution  of  the  case  and,\n\ntherefore, U.S.S.G.   3C1.1 would not apply.  This,  however,\n\ndoes not justify imposing  a two-level increase by distorting\n\nthe meaning of the \"more than minimal planning\" guideline.  \n\n          I do  not think  we should disregard  common sense,\n\nlogic,  and  the plain  meaning of  words  when we  enter the\n\nlabyrinth of the sentencing guidelines.  \"Plan\" is defined in\n\nthe  dictionary  as \"a  scheme  or method  of  acting, doing,\n\nproceeding,  making, etc.,  developed  in  advance.\"   Random\n                                                  \n\nHouse  Dictionary  of  the  English Language  1480  (2nd  Ed.\n\nUnabridged 1987) (emphasis added).  I agree with the  Seventh\n\n                    \n\n4.    The  presentence report did  not recommend an  increase\nbased  on obstructing  justice,  U.S.S.G.    3C1.1.   At  the\nsentencing   hearing,  the   government  admitted   that  the\ndefendant's story had not misled the investigation.  \n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nCircuit that a story concocted after the offense, false as it\n\nmay be, should  not be  included within the  term \"more  than\n\nminimal  planning,\" unless  there is  some evidence  that the\n\nstory  was fabricated  as part  of the  pre-offense planning.\n\nUnited  States v.  Maciaga, 965  F.2d 404,  407-08 (7th  Cir.\n                          \n\n1992).   \n\n          In this case, the defendant told a false story, and\n\nrecruited  a friend  to help  mislead the  investigation more\n\nthan a year after he committed the offense.   I have examined\n\nthe  presentence report,  and  the record  of the  sentencing\n\nhearing  and  have  found  no  evidence  that  the  defendant\n\nconcocted the story before the  offense, but waited until the\n\ninvestigation began to put his plan into action, as the court\n\nseems to assume.  In fact,  the defendant did not contact his\n\nfriend  until after  the investigation  had begun,  16 months\n\nafter  the offense.5    Under the  facts  of this  case,  the\n\napplication of the \"more than minimal planning\" guideline was\n\nerror.   It is  contrary to  the  guideline and  accompanying\n\ncommentary,  and it  completely distorts  the meaning  of the\n\nword \"planning.\"\n\n          I respectfully dissent.\n\n                    \n\n     5     At   the   sentencing   hearing,  the   government\ncharacterized the defendant's friend  as \"a recruit after the\ncrime.\"\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n",

The Francos never received their check.\n\nInstead, on  May 17,  1990, defendant deposited  the Francos'\n\n                             -3-\n\nrefund check in  a checking  account he had  opened two  days\n\nearlier at a Fleet Bank branch in Lincoln, Rhode Island.  The\n\nback of  the refund check  was endorsed \"Domingo  Franco\" and\n\n\"Francisco  (sic) D.  Franco.\"  Underneath  the endorsements,\n\nwhich were forged, defendant signed his own name and address.\n\nNo other deposits were  made to the account, which  reached a\n\nzero balance  on June  5, 1990.   The account  was closed  on\n\nJuly 16, 1990.\n\n          In May of 1991, the Providence office of the United\n\nStates Secret  Service began an  investigation into  possible\n\nfraud  in the negotiation of  the Francos' refund  check.  As\n\ndefendant's name and address  were on the back of  the check,\n\nSpecial  Agent  Rudolph  Rivera  contacted  him.    Defendant\n\nadmitted to having signed his name  on the back of the check,\n\nbut stated that  he had been  handed the check by  a Hispanic\n\nman as partial payment for a car.  According to defendant, an\n\nacquaintance  of his,  named Joseph  Massey, had  brought the\n\nHispanic  man to defendant to buy the car.  Defendant claimed\n\nthat  the Hispanic man had identified himself as the payee on\n\nthe refund check.\n\n          Special  Agent Rivera  obtained from  the defendant\n\nexemplars of the  defendant's handwriting.   After  examining\n\nthese,  Rivera  concluded  that  defendant's  handwriting was\n\ndissimilar from the forged signatures.\n\n                             -4-\n\n          In late July, 1991, Fleet  Bank contacted Detective\n\nWilliam   Carnes  of  the   Lincoln,  Rhode   Island,  Police\n\nDepartment concerning  the Francos'  refund check.   After an\n\ninterview  with  defendant in  which  defendant repeated  his\n\nstory with minor variations, defendant, Detective Carnes, and\n\nanother police officer traveled to Central Falls in search of\n\nthe Hispanic  man to  whom defendant  had allegedly sold  the\n\ncar,  as well as to Union Avenue  in Providence to search for\n\nan \"Italian guy\" who allegedly had sold the car to defendant.\n\nTheir  search was  unsuccessful.   Detective  Carnes  located\n\nJoseph  Massey and  obtained Massey's  agreement to  speak to\n\nSpecial Agent Rivera about the case.  In a written statement,\n\nMassey corroborated defendant's story about the Hispanic man.\n\n          After federal investigators  recontacted Massey  in\n\nFebruary  1992,  Massey  admitted  that   his  prior  written\n\nstatement was false.   Massey testified for the government at\n\ntrial.   He admitted on  direct examination that  he had been\n\nconvicted once  for forging  a welfare  check  and twice  for\n\nlarceny  of a motor vehicle.  Massey testified that on August\n\n1, 1991,  defendant went  to Massey's wife's  house and  told\n\nMassey that  he was in  trouble about a  check.  During  this\n\nconversation, defendant  asked Massey to tell  the police the\n\nstory  about the  Hispanic  man.   Massey  agreed because  he\n\nbelieved defendant was threatening him.\n\n                             -5-\n\n          Defendant  was  denied  permission  to  call  as  a\n\nwitness Zelmare Amaral, the landlady of 101 Carpenter Street,\n\nPawtucket, Rhode Island.   Defendant sought to introduce Mrs.\n\nAmaral's  testimony primarily  to impeach  Massey's testimony\n\nthat  he lived  at the  101 Carpenter  Street address.   Mrs.\n\nAmaral had testified at the first trial that Massey's brother\n\nand  sister, not  Massey,  resided at  101 Carpenter  Street,\n\nalthough  she acknowledged  having  seen Massey  there.   The\n\ncourt  would  not  allow   Mrs.  Amaral  to  testify,  saying\n\ndefendant was merely  seeking to  impeach Massey  on a  \"very\n\ncollateral\" matter.\n\n          The jury  returned a  guilty verdict and  defendant\n\nwas  sentenced  to  11  months  imprisonment.    This  appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                             II.\n\n     A.  Impeachment on Collateral Matters\n                                          \n\n          Defendant  contends the  district court  abused its\n\ndiscretion  when it  precluded  Mrs. Amaral  from taking  the\n\nstand to contradict Massey's  testimony that he lived  at 101\n\nCarpenter  Street.     Defendant  points  to   Supreme  Court\n\nauthority  that a  defendant is  entitled to  cross-examine a\n\nwitness  as to  his or her  name and  address.   See Smith v.\n                                                          \n\nIllinois, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107610\"><a href=\"/opinion/107610/smith-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 131  (1968); Alford v.

Defendant concedes,  as he must,\n\nthat the district court permitted him to cross-examine Massey\n\n                             -6-\n\non his address.  Defendant contends,  however, that the value\n\nof his  right to ask Massey where he lives for the purpose of\n\n\"exposing falsehood\" is vastly diminished if defendant cannot\n\nalso present extrinsic evidence demonstrating that Massey has\n\nlied.   Defendant additionally argues that,  quite apart from\n\nthe value  of Mrs. Amaral's  testimony to  impeach Massey  by\n\ncontradiction, the proffered testimony was relevant to expose\n\nMassey's motive to testify falsely.  We find neither argument\n\npersuasive.\n\n          It is well established that a party may not present\n\nextrinsic evidence to impeach a witness by contradiction on a\n\ncollateral matter.1  E.g., United  States v. Pisari, 636 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n                    \n\n1.  The government  argues  that Mrs.  Amaral's testimony  is\nbarred by Rule 608(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which\nexpressly precludes  the use of extrinsic  evidence solely to\nimpeach a witness's credibility.  The rule states in relevant\npart:  \"Specific instances  of the conduct of a  witness, for\nthe  purpose  of   attacking  or   supporting  the   witness'\ncredibility, other  than conviction  of crime as  provided in\nrule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\"  Like the\ngeneral rule barring the use of extrinsic evidence to impeach\na witness  on a collateral matter  through contradiction, the\npurpose of Rule 608(b)'s prohibition of extrinsic evidence is\nto  avoid  holding mini-trials  on  irrelevant or  collateral\nmatters.

According  to defendant, Massey's  insistence\n\nthat he lived at 101 Carpenter Street in Pawtucket and not at\n\nhis  wife's house on Pine Street in Central Falls, could have\n\nbeen viewed as an attempt to distance himself from the forged\n\ncheck,  which  had originally  been  mailed  to the  Francos'\n\nresidence in Central Falls.

As noted by the district judge, who\n\npresided   over  defendant's   first  trial,   Mrs.  Amaral's\n\n                             -9-\n\ntestimony  was  inconclusive.     She   testified  that   she\n\noccasionally  saw Massey,  a truck  driver, at  101 Carpenter\n\nStreet,  but  that his  brother  and  sister paid  the  rent.\n\nMoreover, as the district  court noted, Pawtucket is adjacent\n\nto  Central Falls;  therefore,  whether Massey  lived at  his\n\nsiblings'  house in Pawtucket or his  wife's house in Central\n\nFalls said little about  Massey's personal involvement in the\n\ncrime, particularly since  there had  already been  testimony\n\nthat  Massey spent  at  least some  time  at both  locations.\n\nUnder  the circumstances,  we  cannot say  that the  district\n\ncourt  abused  its  discretion  in  excluding  Mrs.  Amaral's\n\nproposed  testimony concerning  whether Massey  lived  at 101\n\nCarpenter Street.\n\n     B.  More Than Minimal Planning\n                                   \n\n          Defendant  next  argues  that  the  district  court\n\nclearly erred when it  increased defendant's offense level by\n\ntwo levels, having determined  that his offense involved more\n\nthan  minimal  planning   under  U.S.S.G.     2F1.1(b)(2)(A).\n\nSection  2F1.1(b)(2)(A),  which  governs  offenses  involving\n\nfraud or deceit, states that if an offense involves more than\n\nminimal planning,  the offense  level should be  increased by\n\ntwo  levels.   Application  Note  1(f) of  the  commentary to\n\nU.S.S.G.    1B1.1 defines what constitutes  more than minimal\n\nplanning.  It states, in part, the following:\n\n          \"More than minimal planning\"  also exists\n          if  significant  affirmative  steps  were\n\n                             -10-\n\n          taken  to conceal the offense, other than\n          conduct to which    3C1.1 (Obstructing or\n          Impeding  the Administration  of Justice)\n          applies.\n\nRelying  on  the  above-quoted passage,  the  district  court\n\nenhanced  defendant's  offense level  for  more  than minimal\n\nplanning  on the  basis  of defendant's  attempts to  mislead\n\ninvestigators  with his false story    which he got Massey to\n\ncorroborate     about a Hispanic man.  We review the district\n\ncourt's enhancement  for more than minimal  planning only for\n\nclear  error.  E.g., United States v. Gregorio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577673\"><a href=\"/opinion/577673/united-states-v-william-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                              \n\n343 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          On appeal, both  parties focus  their arguments  on\n\nwhether  the  \"significant  affirmative  steps\"   to  conceal\n\nmentioned in    1B1.1, Application Note 1(f), must take place\n\nbefore  a defendant  commits  an offense  for an  enhancement\n      \n\nunder    2F1.1(b)(2)(A) to  apply.  Defendant  argues that in\n\norder for  the more than  minimal planning enhancement  to be\n\napplied   based   on   significant   affirmative   steps   of\n\nconcealment,  there  must be  evidence  that  the steps  were\n\nplanned  or at least contemplated prior  to the commission of\n\nthe offense.   The  government, on  the other hand,  contends\n\nthat  significant steps to  conceal an  offense after  it has\n                                                     \n\nbeen  committed will  warrant  an enhancement  for more  than\n\nminimal planning.\n\n          In  arguing that  there  most  be some  pre-offense\n\nplanning,  defendant  relies primarily  on  United  States v.\n                                                          \n\n                             -11-\n\nMaciaga, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583971\"><a href=\"/opinion/583971/united-states-v-matthew-c-maciaga/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th  Cir. 1992).

To deflect suspicion from  himself, the guard\n\ntold  investigating  authorities  that  he  had  been  having\n\nproblems with night deposit bags becoming stuck in the chute.\n\nThe sentencing  judge enhanced the guard's  sentence for more\n\nthan minimal  planning, finding that the  false statements to\n\ninvestigators  constituted  significant affirmative  steps to\n\nconceal  the  larceny.   In  reversing  the enhancement,  the\n\nSeventh Circuit  noted that \"[w]hen the  enhancement has been\n\napplied because  a defendant  has taken significant  steps to\n\nconceal the offense, evidence of some pre-offense planning of\n                                                             \n\nthe concealment  has been present.\"   Id. at 407.   The court\n                                         \n\nthen  held  that the  guard's  false  story to  investigators\n\namounted to no more than the \"'logical' step  of discouraging\n\nan investigation,\"  and did not constitute  more than minimal\n\nplanning.  Id. at 408.\n              \n\n          We  are  unwilling  to go  so  far  as  the Seventh\n\nCircuit in  requiring direct evidence of pre-offense planning\n\nof   the   concealment.      It   is   true   that   U.S.S.G.\n\n  2F1.1(b)(2)(A)  indicates  that  the  offense  itself  must\n\n\"involve\" more than minimal planning.  We recognize there may\n\nbe   situations  where  a   defendant's  subsequent  cover-up\n\nactivity is  so disassociated from  the earlier  crime as  to\n\nmake it unreasonable to find that the crime itself \"involved\"\n\n                             -12-\n\nmore than minimal planning.  But we believe the determination\n\nis essentially one of fact for the district court.  Crimes of\n\nfraud  and deceit  by their  very nature  may, and  often do,\n\ncompel, quite predictably, later efforts at a cover-up.  Thus\n\ndefendant here, having put his name and address on the check,\n\nknew  that   he  would   probably  be  later   questioned  by\n\nauthorities, at which time he would necessarily have to offer\n\nsome  innocent explanation.   It is not  unreasonable to view\n\nthe false story he  eventually told, and the elaborate  steps\n\nhe  took to support it,  as integral to  the original offense\n\nitself,  so that  the offense  can properly  be said  to have\n\n\"involved\" this later cover-up activity.  That interpretation\n\nis the one most consistent with Application Note 1(f),  which\n\nexpressly includes within \"[m]ore than minimal planning . . .\n\nsignificant  affirmative steps  .  . . taken  to conceal  the\n\noffense.\"    The  application  notes,  while not  conclusive,\n\ndemand considerable deference.   United States v. Weston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580695\"><a href=\"/opinion/580695/united-states-v-albert-weston-united-states-of-america-v-paul-r-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span>\n                                                        \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218 (1st Cir. 1992).  We are less ready, therefore,\n\nthan  the Maciaga court to require direct proof of \"some pre-\n                 \n\noffense  planning of  the  concealment\" where,  as here,  the\n\nnecessity to  conceal was so  integral to the  entire scheme.\n\nMaciaga, 965 F.2d at 407 (emphasis deleted).\n       \n\n          In the instant case, moreover, defendant's cover-up\n\nwas far  more elaborate and  better planned than  in Maciaga.\n                                                            \n\nHe did not merely \"take the 'logical' step of discouraging an\n\n                             -13-\n\ninvestigation\" by telling a  false story to police.   See id.\n                                                             \n\nat 408.   Rather,  defendant recruited a  friend, Massey,  to\n\ncorroborate his own false story by repeating the same tale to\n\ninvestigators.   Defendant also took investigators  on a wild\n\ngoose  chase  throughout the  streets  of  Central Falls  and\n\nProvidence, searching  for the mythical Italian  man who sold\n\nhim  the car and the  elusive Hispanic man  to whom defendant\n\nallegedly  sold  the  car.     These  additional  steps  make\n\ndefendant's attempted concealment much more \"significant\" and\n\n\"affirmative\"  than  those taken  by  the  security guard  in\n\nMaciaga.   Under such  circumstances, we cannot  say that the\n       \n\ndistrict  court   clearly  erred  in   enhancing  defendant's\n\nsentence for  more than  minimal planning, regardless  of the\n\nlack of any  direct evidence  that the cover  story had  been\n\nplanned prior to the offense.2\n\n                    \n\n2.  This conclusion is further buttressed by the reference in\nApplication   Note  1(f)  to   the  obstruction   of  justice\nenhancement,  U.S.S.G.     3C1.1.     Application  Note  1(f)\nexpressly  provides that  significant  affirmative  steps  to\nconceal will not constitute more than minimal planning when  \n3C1.1 applies  to the conduct.  We  think this reference to  \n3C1.1   reflects   implicit   recognition  that   significant\naffirmative  post-offense steps  to conceal  can,  in certain\ncircumstances,  constitute either more  than minimal planning\nunder    2F1.1(b)(2)(A) or an  obstruction of justice under  \n3C1.1.   As the district  court recognized, the  exclusion in\nApplication  Note 1(f) of conduct to which   3C1.1 applies is\nintended to avoid  the double counting  that would result  if\ncourts treated the same post-offense concealment as both more\nthan minimal planning and obstruction of justice.

The application notes following the\n\nguideline  refer  to  the  Commentary  to     1B1.1,  General\n\nApplication  Principles,  for the  definition  of  \"more than\n\nminimal planning.\"  As  the  majority  noted, the  commentary\n\nexplains that,  \"'More than minimal planning'  also exists if\n\nsignificant affirmative  steps  were  taken  to  conceal  the\n\n                    \n\n3.     The presentence report  prepared by  the Rhode  Island\nprobation  department recommended the  two-level increase for\n\"more  than   minimal  planning\"   pursuant  to   U.S.S.G.   \n2F1.1(b)(2)  based on conduct of the offense:  opening a bank\naccount to  deposit the  stolen check, depositing  the check,\nwithdrawing  all of  the funds, and  never using  the account\nagain.   Defense  counsel  objected, and  the district  court\nagreed that the conduct relied upon in the presentence report\ndid not constitute \"more  than minimal planning.\"   The court\nwent on  to find, however,  that the defendant's  false story\nafter the  offense involved \"more than  minimal planning\" and\nimposed the two-level increase based on that finding.\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\noffense, other  than conduct to which   3C1.1 (Obstructing or\n\nImpeding the Administration of  Justice) applies.\"   U.S.S.G.\n\n  1B1.1, Application Note 1(f).   Reading the definition into\n\nthe guideline, it seems clear to me that the focus remains on\n\nconduct  preceding and  involving the  offense.   Attempts to\n\nconceal the  offense, which are  planned and occur  after the\n\noffense, fall  within the definition of  obstructing justice,\n\nand  should not be  considered for  purposes of  a sentencing\n\nincrease  for \"more  than minimal  planning.\"4   The majority\n\npoints  out  correctly  that  in this  case  the  defendant's\n\nconcocted story did not  significantly impede or obstruct the\n\nofficial  investigation  or  prosecution  of  the  case  and,\n\ntherefore, U.S.S.G.   3C1.1 would not apply.  This,  however,\n\ndoes not justify imposing  a two-level increase by distorting\n\nthe meaning of the \"more than minimal planning\" guideline.  \n\n          I do  not think  we should disregard  common sense,\n\nlogic,  and  the plain  meaning of  words  when we  enter the\n\nlabyrinth of the sentencing guidelines.  \"Plan\" is defined in\n\nthe  dictionary  as \"a  scheme  or method  of  acting, doing,\n\nproceeding,  making, etc.,  developed  in  advance.\"   Random\n                                                  \n\nHouse  Dictionary  of  the  English Language  1480  (2nd  Ed.\n\nUnabridged 1987) (emphasis added).  I agree with the  Seventh\n\n                    \n\n4.    The  presentence report did  not recommend an  increase\nbased  on obstructing  justice,  U.S.S.G.    3C1.1.
