John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                     Lipez, Meritt,* and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges\n\n\n     David A.F. Lewis for appellant.\n     Renée M. Bunker, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nPaula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          March 19, 2009\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.           William Ahrendt1 challenges his\n\ncocaine conspiracy conviction and 210-month sentence.                  He alleges\n\nthat the district court committed two errors at trial:                 declining\n\nto order a reevaluation of his competency and excluding evidence of\n\na   psychological   evaluation.         He    also    alleges   that   the   court\n\ncommitted   two   errors   at    sentencing      by    applying   a    leadership\n\nenhancement and by failing to treat certain prior offenses together\n\nwhen evaluating his criminal history.\n\n                                I.    Background\n\n            The following background facts on Ahrendt's role in the\n\ncocaine conspiracy were elicited at Ahrendt's trial.\n\n            During the relevant time, Ahrendt lived in Bangor, Maine,\n\nin an apartment from which he allowed others to \"come and go.\"                  He\n\nsold drugs out of his apartment, and provided drugs for people to\n\nuse while in his apartment.          In November 2003, he met Sandra Hurd,\n\nwho took advantage of Ahrendt's \"very high clientele\" to \"set up\n\nshop\" in his apartment selling drugs.                Hurd solicited two other\n\nindividuals, Randy Brimley and Kelvin Deloatch, for the operation.\n\nHurd, Brimley and Deloatch were generally responsible for bringing\n\nmultiple shipments of cocaine per week from Massachusetts to\n\nBangor, Maine.2\n\n\n1\n  This appeal is captioned \"United States v. Aherndt,\" but we will\nspell appellant's surname as he spelled it at trial: Ahrendt.\n2\n  Other individuals were active in the conspiracy, but their roles\nare not relevant here.\n\n                                       -2-\n\f           On arrival in Bangor, some of the cocaine would be taken\n\nto Ahrendt's apartment, although most of it was stored elsewhere in\n\nBangor.    If there was not enough cocaine at Ahrendt's apartment,\n\nsomeone other than Ahrendt would be dispatched to another location\n\nin Bangor to replenish supplies.      In Ahrendt's apartment, the\n\ncocaine was weighed, packaged and sold to buyers who would come to\n\nthe apartment.   Ahrendt was one of the people who would weigh the\n\ncocaine.   He was also one of the sellers, although Deloatch sold\n\nthe lion's share.    In addition, some of the powder cocaine was\n\ncooked into crack cocaine in the apartment.    Brimley did most of\n\nthe cooking, although Ahrendt also cooked small quantities of\n\npowder into crack. If either Deloatch or Brimley were present, one\n\nof them would take money from the drug sales to store it elsewhere\n\nin Bangor; if not, Ahrendt would hold the money until Deloatch or\n\nBrimley arrived.\n\n           At his trial, Ahrendt acknowledged that he used drugs\n\nhimself, sold drugs, and gave drugs to other people.        He also\n\nacknowledged that he weighed cocaine with his own scales, packaged\n\nit, and cooked powder cocaine into crack.   He testified, however,\n\nthat he was not part of the conspiracy, that he was an \"outsider\"\n\nand \"kept in . . . the dark.\"    He testified that he \"didn't have\n\nany specific arrangements with these individuals . . . .   They came\n\nand went, just like everybody else that came in my door.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f            Several months of police investigation culminated in the\n\narrest of seven people, including Ahrendt, in April 2004.                 After\n\nAhrendt's arrest and his pre-trial incarceration at Fort Devens,\n\nMassachusetts, issues arose as to his competency to stand trial.\n\nOn motion of his counsel, Ahrendt was evaluated by a forensic\n\npsychologist on staff at Fort Devens who submitted a written report\n\nto the court.         This report relied on Ahrendt's mental health\n\nrecords from both the Bangor Mental Health Institute (BMHI) and\n\nfrom Acadia Hospital in Bangor, as well as on interviews with\n\nAhrendt.\n\n            Ahrendt had been hospitalized at BMHI from December 2001\n\nto April 2002.        He was treated for symptoms including suicidal\n\nimpulses, poor concentration and disorganized thoughts; treated\n\nwith antidepressants and an antipsychotic drug; and given multiple\n\ndiagnoses (Major Depressive Disorder, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\n\nand Antisocial Personality Disorder).             Between 2002 and 2004,\n\nAhrendt was treated on an outpatient basis at Acadia Hospital in\n\nBangor   for    \"mood    alterations,    vague    complaints      of   auditory\n\nhallucinations, and multiple suicide threats.\"               He was further\n\ndiagnosed      with   Major   Depression,    Recurrent,      With      Psychotic\n\nFeatures; History of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Not Otherwise\n\nSpecified;      and     Personality    Disorder    with      Histrionic       and\n\nNarcissistic     Features.      He    was   treated   with    a     variety   of\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fpsychotropic     medications.        Neither   set   of   records   discussed\n\nAhrendt's substance use.\n\n            The report posited that because Ahrendt was using drugs\n\nduring the pendency of his prior hospitalizations, his \"degree of\n\ndrug use could possibly explain\" the symptoms reported in his\n\nmedical records.      The report concluded by diagnosing Ahrendt with\n\nPersonality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified and with substance\n\nuse-related diagnoses, but noted that these diagnoses did not\n\n\"appear to be impairing his level of functioning to consult with\n\nhis   attorney   or   make   rational    decisions    regarding     his   legal\n\nmatters.\"\n\n            After the submission of the report, the district court\n\nheld a competency hearing in January 2005.            At that hearing, the\n\nreport was admitted into evidence without objection.3               The court\n\nalso engaged in a discussion with Ahrendt about his competency,\n\nasking if he understood what was happening and explaining the legal\n\nstandard for competency in response to Ahrendt's questions. At the\n\nconclusion of the hearing, the court ruled Ahrendt competent to\n\nstand   trial,    pledging      to   \"remain    diligent    regarding      [the\n\ncompetency] issue during the course of any further proceedings.\"\n\n\n\n\n3\n   Defense counsel mentioned that Ahrendt disagreed with some of\nthe specific statements that Ahrendt had allegedly made to the\npsychologist, but acknowledged that those statements did not affect\nthe conclusions in the report.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f          At around this time, Ahrendt began sending letters to the\n\ncourt.   The letters expounded upon Ahrendt's personal philosophy\n\nand view of the justice system.4      At an April 2005 hearing on an\n\nunrelated issue, the court commented that \"the letters could be\n\ninterpreted as threatening.\"   Ahrendt's counsel responded that the\n\nletters were not threatening, and that Ahrendt was \"a person who\n\njust lives in a different world than the rest of us.\"\n\n          At a May 2005 hearing on a request for a continuance,\n\nAhrendt's counsel reported that his client had been evaluated by\n\nmental health professionals and in counsel's opinion, \"there are\n\nsome serious problems there.\"      At a July hearing on counsel's\n\nmotion to withdraw, which was denied, the court questioned Ahrendt\n\nabout his relationship with counsel. Ahrendt stated, \"it basically\n\ncomes down to, sir, [that] your law stands against my beliefs, and\n\nI'd like to represent my beliefs against your law, and that's it.\n\nMy law stands for love, and yours stands against the Almighty God,\n\nand that's the battle.\"     Ahrendt explained that he wanted to\n\n\n\n\n4\n  We present a representative sampling of excerpts from Ahrendt's\nletters. More than thirty letters were filed with the district\ncourt between April 2005 and January 2007.\n     (1) \"Follow your way sir and impose your justice. I hope your\nsoul was worth it!\"\n     (2) \"I liked our chat in your room of truth. I desire, and\nwould appreciate if we could do it again?\"\n     (3) \"I have already shown the Truth of you and your kind and\nof what is it. HAHAHA! This Trial is 'you' nailing 'your' own\ncoffin shut. For Real. You seem to believe you are what makes up\nReality, the Truth. NOT! Wow, what a lust sir.\"\n\n                                -6-\n\f\"change [the justice] system\" and asked the court, \"Why don't you\n\nhelp me do what I'm trying to accomplish?\"\n\n            As trial approached, Ahrendt's counsel filed a notice of\n\nintent to introduce as expert evidence the testimony of clinical\n\npsychologist Dr. Jeffrey Aston.          Based on interviews with Ahrendt,\n\nDr. Aston had prepared testimony that agreed with the Fort Devens\n\nReport   that   Ahrendt    was   \"technically     competent,\"     and   offered\n\nfurther explanation of Ahrendt's point of view and behavior.\n\n            [Ahrendt] is obviously given to a peculiar\n            turn of mind which interprets everything in\n            terms of a highly abstracted philosophy of\n            life . . . . In Mr. Ahrendt's view, the world\n            consists of persons who are motivated either\n            by negative selfishness (\"Lust\") or positive\n            altruism (\"Love\").       For him, drug use\n            resembles an almost sacramental consumption of\n            what the \"Divine\" Lovingly provides us, while\n            society's war on drugs is a misguided Lust to\n            control what others do.\n\nThe government filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude this\n\ntestimony.      The court agreed with the government and ruled the\n\nproffered     testimony    inadmissible       under   Fed.   R.    Evid.   403,\n\nexplaining that the testimony had \"a significant potential for\n\nconfusing and misleading the jury and causing unfair prejudice.\"\n\nThe   court     noted     that   such     testimony    might      invite   jury\n\nnullification, stating, \"[t]he sincerity of Mr. Ahrendt's belief\n\nthat he is entitled to the 'sacramental consumption' of drugs is\n\nnot properly before the Court.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f          Several weeks before trial, the court permitted Ahrendt\n\nto waive his right to counsel and represent himself, with his\n\nformer counsel serving as standby counsel.              At this time, his\n\ncounsel had expressed concern that Ahrendt would not pursue a\n\nsensible defense strategy. The court specifically asked if counsel\n\nwas requesting a reevaluation of Ahrendt's competency, and counsel\n\nreplied that he could not make such a request \"in good faith.\"\n\n          At trial in September 2005, Ahrendt cross-examined the\n\ngovernment's    witnesses,   eliciting      testimony    bearing     on   the\n\ncredibility of at least one witness, and made a successful hearsay\n\nobjection. Ahrendt also testified in his own defense. Despite his\n\nefforts, the jury convicted Ahrendt of conspiracy to distribute,\n\nand to possess with the intent to distribute, both cocaine and\n\ncocaine base under 21 U.S.C. §§ 846 & 841(a)(2).\n\n          In the presentence investigation report (\"PSR\") prepared\n\nfor Ahrendt's sentencing, he was given a two-level leadership\n\nenhancement    under   U.S.S.G.   §    3B1.1(c)   for   his   role   in   the\n\nconspiracy.    The resulting offense level was thirty-four.          The PSR\n\nalso listed four prior convictions.          Although Ahrendt had been\n\nsentenced for three of those offenses on the same day, and the\n\nthree offenses had occurred within one week of each other and had\n\nsimilar characteristics, each conviction was counted separately, as\n\na \"prior sentence\" under § 4A1.2(a)(2).           Ahrendt was accordingly\n\nawarded eight criminal history points, putting him in Criminal\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fHistory Category (\"CHC\") IV.   See § 4A1.1 (two points awarded for\n\neach prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days).\n\nAhrendt's Guidelines Sentencing Range (\"GSR\"), based on an offense\n\nlevel of thirty-four and a CHC of IV, was 210 - 262 months.\n\n           The court remarked at the commencement of the sentencing\n\nhearing in January 2006 that it wanted to be as fair as possible to\n\nAhrendt, who responded, \"Let me go home?\"   When Ahrendt was asked\n\nif he objected to any of the findings, he stated that he objected\n\nto \"[t]he whole thing.\" The district court responded, \"Defendant's\n\nobjection is noted and overruled\" and the findings of the PSI were\n\nadopted.   Ahrendt was sentenced to the low end of the GSR, 210\n\nmonths' imprisonment, followed by four years of supervised release.\n\nThe court asked Ahrendt if he had any specific objection to those\n\nterms, to which Ahrendt responded, \"Disrespect is disrespect.\n\nThat's all right.\"     The court stated, \"To the extent that is\n\ninterpreted as an objection, the objection's overruled.\"\n\n           On appeal, Ahrendt argues that the district court erred\n\nin declining to order a reevaluation of his competency.    He also\n\nclaims error in the court's exclusion, under Fed. R. Evid. 403, of\n\nthe psychological evaluation prepared by Dr. Aston.   Ahrendt also\n\nalleges sentencing errors in both the leadership enhancement and\n\nthe separate counting of his prior convictions.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f                          II.   Discussion\n\n                          A.    Competency\n\n          A district court's competency determination, made after\n\na hearing on the defendant's competency to stand trial, will be\n\nupheld unless clearly erroneous.   United States v. Lebrón, 76 F.3d\n\n29, 32 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          Ahrendt argues that despite the court's finding at the\n\ncompetency hearing in January 2005 that he was in fact competent to\n\nstand trial, later events cast sufficient doubt on that conclusion\n\nsuch that the court should have ordered a reevaluation.\n\n          Determining competency to stand trial involves an inquiry\n\ninto whether the defendant \"has sufficient present ability to\n\nconsult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational\n\nunderstanding -- and whether he has a rational as well as factual\n\nunderstanding of the proceedings against him.\"     Dusky v. United\n\nStates, 362 U.S. 402, 402 (1960) (per curiam).   The obligation to\n\ndetermine competency to stand trial is continuing, and persists\n\nthroughout a proceeding including through the sentencing phase.\n\nSee Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162, 181 (1975) (\"Even when a\n\ndefendant is competent at the commencement of his trial, a trial\n\ncourt must always be alert to circumstances suggesting a change\n\nthat would render the accused unable to meet the standards of\n\ncompetence to stand trial.\") A court must order a competency\n\nhearing on motion from either the defense or the government, or sua\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fsponte, \"if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant\n\nmay   presently    be   suffering         from   a   mental   disease      or   defect\n\nrendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable\n\nto understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings\n\nagainst him or to assist properly in his defense.\"                       18 U.S.C. §\n\n4241 (emphasis added).\n\n            Ahrendt points specifically to two sets of communications\n\n-- statements made by his counsel throughout the proceedings, and\n\nAhrendt's    own   statements        and    letters     --    that   he    maintains\n\ndemonstrated   the      need   for    a    reevaluation       of   his    competency.\n\nAhrendt points to his counsel's statements that \"[Ahrendt] is a\n\nperson who just lives in a different world than the rest of us\" and\n\n\"there are some serious problems there,\" and also cites comments at\n\na September 2005 hearing reflecting concern over Ahrendt's defense\n\nstrategy.     In addition Ahrendt argues that his own statements\n\nindicate both that he was not fully aware of the nature of his\n\ntrial and sentencing, and that he was generally divorced from\n\nreality.    He cites his request that the trial court help him\n\naccomplish his goal of changing the justice system, his comment at\n\nhis sentencing \"Let me go home?\" and the letters that he continued\n\nto send to the court.\n\n            Neither counsel's statements nor Ahrendt's own statements\n\nreach the \"reasonable cause\" threshold to require a sua sponte\n\nhearing.     Although defense counsel has a \"unique vantage for\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fobserving whether her client is competent,\"                         United States v.\n\nMuriel Cruz, 412 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 2005), counsel's observations\n\nabout \"serious problems\" and Ahrendt \"liv[ing] in a different\n\nworld\" are not of a tenor that would suggest cause to conduct a\n\ncompetency evaluation. This is particularly true in the context of\n\nAhrendt's performance at trial, where he made a successful hearsay\n\nobjection and cross-examined government witnesses in an attempt to\n\nshow that the requirements for proving a conspiracy were not met.\n\nWhile   ultimately        unsuccessful,        his    performance           belies        the\n\ncontention that he was \"unable . . . to assist properly in his\n\ndefense.\"        18    U.S.C.   §   4241.      We    also    note        that   after     the\n\ncompetency hearing, the district court took an active role in\n\nassessing   Ahrendt's        competency       through       the     pendency       of     the\n\nproceedings.          The court and Ahrendt had lengthy discussions on\n\nmultiple occasions -- the hearings in July and September, at trial,\n\nand at sentencing -- in which the judge questioned Ahrendt about\n\nhis understanding of various aspects of the process.\n\n            As    to     Ahrendt's     own    statements,           we     note    that     a\n\ndefendant's      failure    to      grasp    how    the     legal    system       and     the\n\nsentencing process operate can constitute reasonable cause for a\n\ncourt to sua sponte order a competency evaluation.                              See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Giron-Reyes, 234 F.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(defendant's apparent inability to understand critical aspects of\n\nthe proceedings, including the role of the jury and the Sentencing\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fGuidelines, suggested that defendant may not have been competent).\n\nBut Ahrendt's comments do not convey the lack of understanding\n\nevidenced     in    Giron-Reyes.       Ahrendt     both     demonstrated     an\n\nunderstanding of and participated in the proceedings.                 Although\n\nAhrendt argues that his letters to the court changed demonstrably\n\nin tone and content during the pendency of the proceedings such\n\nthat the letters should have triggered a reevaluation of his\n\ncompetency, counsel reported prior to trial that the letters had\n\nbeen reviewed by Dr. Aston, who had not expressed an opinion that\n\nthere had been a change in Ahrendt's competency.\n\n            Short of reasonable cause to believe that Ahrendt was\n\nmentally incompetent to stand trial, the district court was not\n\nobligated   to     order   a   reevaluation.       In    light   of   Ahrendt's\n\ndemonstrated understanding and participation in the trial, neither\n\nhis own communications alone, nor in combination with statements by\n\ncounsel, constituted reasonable cause.           Ahrendt had been evaluated\n\nby qualified mental health professionals, both prior to the initial\n\ncompetency hearing (the Fort Devens Report) and after it (the Aston\n\ntestimony).        We   have   interpreted   a   qualified       mental   health\n\nprofessional's report to be an important factor for the trial court\n\nto consider when determining competency.                See United States v.\n\nBruck, 152 F.3d 40, 47 (1st Cir. 1998) (when psychiatrist has found\n\ndefendant to be competent, trial court need not hold a competency\n\nhearing absent extenuating circumstances); see also Lebrón, 76 F.3d\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fat 32 (same).     Here, the district court was presented with first\n\nsuch reports, both of which concluded that Ahrendt was competent to\n\nstand trial.      We cannot say that it was clear error for the\n\ndistrict court to decline to order a reevaluation of Ahrendt's\n\ncompetency to stand trial.\n\n                              B.     403 Ruling\n\n           Evidentiary rulings of the district court are reviewed\n\nfor an abuse of discretion.        United States v. Turner, 501 F.3d 59,\n\n72 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n           Ahrendt argues that because the government was required\n\nto prove specific intent to convict him of the conspiracy charge,\n\nthe exclusion of the proffered expert testimony of Dr. Aston\n\n(describing     Ahrendt's    view      of    drug    use     as    \"sacramental\n\nconsumption\") was erroneous.         Such testimony, he says, would have\n\nbeen probative to his ability, vel non, to form the requisite\n\nintent.\n\n           A    defendant   is   allowed     to   present    mental-condition\n\nevidence short of establishing insanity under 18 U.S.C. § 17(a) if\n\nthe evidence is relevant to determining the defendant's ability to\n\nform the requisite intent to commit the crime.               United States v.\n\nSchneider, 111 F.3d 197, 201 (1st Cir. 1997).               Even if relevant,\n\nthough, such evidence may be excluded if its \"probative value may\n\nbe substantially outweighed by confusion or delay\" or if the\n\nevidence   is   from   an   expert    and    fails   to    \"meet   the   further\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\frequisites of scientific reliability and helpfulness to the jury.\"\n\nId., at 201; Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n\n           The government is indeed required to prove specific\n\nintent, see 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(2), but Dr. Aston's testimony would\n\nhave had no bearing on this question.              Ahrendt's beliefs in a\n\nhigher law are not probative of his ability to form the requisite\n\nintent.    See United States v. White, 766 F.2d 22, 24 (1st Cir.\n\n1985) (evidence of motivation for violating law, in this case\n\ninfluence of defendant's mother, irrelevant if defendant is capable\n\nof forming specific criminal intent.)           Moreover, even if relevant,\n\nDr. Aston's testimony had significant potential to confuse or\n\nmislead the jury.        As the district court said,\n\n           Dr. Aston may not give voice to and implicitly\n           legitimize what he describes as Mr. Ahrendt's\n           'deviant' set of values without effectively\n           promoting jury nullification . . . . Further,\n           Dr. Aston's testimony could mislead the jury\n           into thinking that Mr. Ahrendt's idiosyncratic\n           philosophy amounts to a form of temporary\n           insanity or ameliorates the offense . . . .\n\nSee Schneider, 111 F.3d at 201 (in assessing medical evidence\n\noffered regarding to defendant's ability to form requisite intent,\n\ndistrict   court    is    \"closer   to   the   case\"   and   has   \"comparative\n\nadvantage\").       The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nexcluding the testimony.\n\n                               C.   Sentencing\n\n           The government argues that although Ahrendt may have made\n\ntwo generic objections at sentencing, he never objected to the\n\n                                     -15-\n\fparticular issues he now appeals: the leadership enhancement under\n\nU.S.S.G.   §   3B1.1(c),   and    the     classification   of   his   prior\n\nconvictions under § 4A1.2(a)(2). See United States v. Jimenez, 512\n\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2007) (defendant's failure to object to\n\nparticular findings of PSR waives objection).          Ahrendt told the\n\ncourt that he objected to the \"whole thing\" and that \"[D]isrespect\n\nis disrespect.      That's all right.\"        Even we were to adopt a\n\ngenerous stance in light of Ahrendt's pro se status at sentencing,\n\nhis generic objections cannot be fairly interpreted as giving\n\nnotice to the court of these two very specific issues.            Thus we\n\napply plain error review.        United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725\n\n(1993).\n\n           To succeed on plain error review, Ahrendt must show: \"(1)\n\nthat an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not\n\nonly (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4)\n\nseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"     United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).5    With respect to factual determinations, \"[an]\n\n\n5\n   We have at times applied a flexible standard in the sentencing\ncontext with respect to the third and fourth prongs of plain error\nreview. United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 78 (1st Cir.\n2005); see also United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 74,\n81-82 (2004). To meet the third prong, that the error \"affected\nthe defendant's substantial rights\" in the sentencing context, a\ndefendant must show on the sentencing record \"a reasonable\nprobability that, but for the error, the district court would have\nimposed a different, more favorable sentence.\" United States v.\nGilman, 478 F.3d 440, 447 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing United States v.\nTurbides-Leonardo, 468 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir. 2006)) (internal\n\n                                   -16-\n\ferror cannot be clear or obvious unless the desired factual finding\n\nis the only one rationally supported by the record below.\"        United\n\nStates v. Goodhue, 486 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Donnelly, 370 F.3d 87, 95 (1st Cir. 2004)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).    Where the issue is a district court's\n\ninterpretation of the Guidelines, we will not find clear or obvious\n\nerror if the \"challenged issue of law is unsettled.\"      Goodhue, 486\n\nF.3d at 57.\n\n          We can dispense quickly with Ahrendt's objection to the\n\nleadership enhancement as he fails to meet even the first hurdle of\n\nplain error review.   Ahrendt makes two arguments:     first, that the\n\nrecord does not adequately support the imposition of a leadership\n\nenhancement; and second, that the district court inadequately\n\nconsidered the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors in this regard.\n\n          The   Guidelines   impose    a   two-level   increase   to   a\n\ndefendant's offense level based on that defendant's status -- that\n\nhe or she acted as \"an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in\n\nany criminal activity other than [an activity involving five or\n\nmore participants or that was otherwise extensive].\"        U.S.S.G. §\n\n3B1.1(c); see also United States v. Thiongo, 344 F.3d 55, 61-62\n\n(1st Cir. 2003); United States v. Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d 105, 111\n\n\n\nquotation marks omitted). To meet the fourth prong, a defendant\nmust then show that \"leaving the error uncorrected would cause a\nmiscarriage of justice.\" United States v. McCoy, 508 F.3d 74, 80\n(1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                                -17-\n\f(1st Cir. 1995).    Relevant factors to consider include \"the degree\n\nof participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature\n\nand scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and\n\nauthority exercised over others.\"         U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1 cmt. n.4.\n\n           Ahrendt's leadership status is borne out by the record.\n\nHe may not have been the ringleader of this operation, but he had\n\nsome   authority   within   the   conspiracy   in   that   he   rented   the\n\napartment where drugs were processed, packaged and sold, and held\n\nmoney for short periods of time.             He also played a role in\n\n\"organizing,\" as he provided the clientele in Bangor.           Classifying\n\na defendant's role in a particular criminal enterprise is a \"fact-\n\nspecific task,\" Thiongo, 344 F.3d at 62, and the district court's\n\ndetermination that Ahrendt's role merited a two-level leadership\n\nenhancement was not error.\n\n           Further, the district court did not, as Ahrendt now\n\nargues, inadequately consider § 3553(a)(6):          the \"need to avoid\n\nunwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar\n\nrecords who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\"            Ahrendt\n\nmaintains that the disparity between his sentence of 210 months and\n\nBrimley and Deloatch's sentences of forty-two and sixty-six months,\n\nrespectively, was unwarranted. But in addition to having different\n\ncriminal history profiles, Brimley and Deloatch pled guilty and so\n\nwere not \"similarly situated\" for sentencing purposes.           See United\n\nStates v. Tom, 504 F.3d 89, 95 (1st Cir. 2007), vacated and\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fremanded on other grounds in Tom v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 1132\n\n(2008).     Moreover, \"section 3553(a)(6) aims primarily at the\n\nminimization of disparities among defendants nationally.\"                 Martin,\n\n520 F.3d at 94.        Again, there was no error in the imposition of the\n\nleadership enhancement.\n\n            Ahrendt's more significant objection to his sentence\n\nconcerns his argument that his prior convictions were erroneously\n\ncounted    as     separate   \"prior    sentences\"    under      §   4A1.1(a)(2).6\n\nSpecifically, Ahrendt contends that the district court should have\n\n\"consolidated\" three of his four prior convictions because they\n\noccurred    \"in    a    single   temporal     cluster\"    and   because   he   was\n\nsentenced for them by the same court on the same date.\n\n            Ahrendt was sentenced in January 2006 under the 2004\n\nversion of the Guidelines. The relevant language provides: \"prior\n\nsentences [for non-violent crimes] imposed in unrelated cases are\n\nto be counted separately. Prior sentences imposed in related cases\n\nare to be treated as one sentence . . . .\"               U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(2)\n\n(2004).    \"Related cases\" are defined in the application notes to §\n\n4A1.2(a)(2) as follows:          \"[P]rior sentences are considered related\n\n\n\n6\n    Ahrendt also argues on appeal that the court inadequately\nconsidered the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors in this regard.     He\ncontends that § 3553(a)(1) compelled consideration of his mental\nhealth issues in analyzing whether his prior convictions were\nunrelated. He does not develop any argumentation as to why those\nmental health issues are relevant to this determination, and we\nconsider this argument waived. United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d\n1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                       -19-\n\fif they resulted from offenses that (A) occurred on the same\n\noccasion, (B) were part of a single common scheme or plan, or (C)\n\nwere consolidated for trial or sentencing.\"        Id. at cmt. n.3.\n\n            The \"consolidation\" factor is at issue here. At the time\n\nof Ahrendt's sentencing, we had made clear that with respect to\n\nconsolidation,\n\n            When   dealing   with    'offenses   that   are\n            temporally and factually distinct (that is,\n            offenses which occurred on different dates and\n            which did not arise out of the same course of\n            conduct), charges based thereon should not be\n            regarded as having been consolidated (and,\n            therefore 'related') unless the original\n            sentencing court entered an actual order of\n            consolidation   or    there   is   some   other\n            persuasive indicium of formal consolidation\n            apparent on the face of the record . . .\n\nUnited States v. Martins, 413 F.3d 139, 151 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(quoting United States v. Correa, 114 F.3d 314 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nMoreover,    our   rule   was   that   a    defendant   could   not   show\n\nconsolidation merely by indicating that the \"sentence was imposed\n\nby the same judge at the same time.\"        Id. (emphasis added).\n\n            In Ahrendt's case, the district court committed no error,\n\nmuch less plain error, when it counted Ahrendt's three convictions\n\nseparately under § 4A1.2(a)(2).        The record evidence supports a\n\nfinding that the offenses were temporally and factually distinct.\n\nAhrendt's three offenses occurred in Maine on March 14, March 15,\n\nand March 19, 2001 respectively.           The first two of these were\n\nviolations of a protection from abuse order prohibiting Ahrendt's\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fcontact with his ex-spouse and the third was a violation of a\n\ncondition of release that he not have contact with her.         Moreover,\n\nthe record reveals neither a formal order consolidating the charges\n\nnor any other evidence of formal consolidation.\n\n            Nevertheless, on November 1, 2007, while this appeal was\n\npending,    the   Sentencing   Commission   adopted   a   non-retroactive\n\namendment7 on this topic, in response to conflicts among the\n\ncircuits.     U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(2) (2007) & Supp. to App. C,\n\nAmendment 709 (2007).      The amendment strikes the term \"related\n\ncases\" and the above definition from the 2007 Guidelines, and adds\n\nnew language such that § 4A1.2(a)(2) now reads: \"[P]rior sentences\n\nare counted separately unless (A) the sentences resulted from\n\noffenses contained in the same charging instrument; or (B) the\n\nsentences were imposed on the same day. Count any prior sentence\n\ncovered by (A) or (B) as a single sentence.\" (emphasis added).\n\nBecause Amendment 709 is non-retroactive, however, Ahrendt is not\n\nentitled to the benefit of this amendment which we have observed\n\n\n7\n   Retroactivity of amendments to the Guidelines is determined by\nthe inclusion of such an amendment under U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10(c)\n(2007). If an amendment is so listed, a defendant is permitted to\nmove for a reduction in sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). An\namendment not listed in § 1B1.10(c) does not have retroactive\neffect.   Retroactivity in the Guidelines context is explicitly\ndistinct from the effect of statutory changes. See United States\nv. Havener, 905 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 1990) (Breyer, J.)\n(distinguishing \"common-law presumption that the repeal of a\ncriminal statute resulted in the abatement of all prosecutions\nwhich had not reached final disposition in the highest court\nauthorized to review them\" from retroactivity of amendments to\nGuidelines (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).\n\n                                   -21-\n\f\"go[es] beyond any circuit's reading of the previous rule in a\n\nmanner favorable to the defendant.\"       See United States v. Godin\n\n(\"Godin II\"), 522 F.3d 133, 134 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n          That said, we understand that if Amendment 709 had been\n\nin operation during Ahrendt's sentencing, his three convictions\n\nwould have been grouped. Although the three charges underlying the\n\nconvictions had separate docket numbers, and although he was\n\nsentenced for each conviction separately, all three sentences were\n\nimposed on the same day. See § 4A1.2(a)(2) (\"[P]rior sentences are\n\ncounted separately unless (A) the sentences resulted from offenses\n\ncontained in the same charging instrument; or (B) the sentences\n\nwere imposed on the same day.    Count any prior sentence covered by\n\n(A) or (B) as a single sentence.\").\n\n          Ahrendt    is   foreclosed    from   arguing   that,   despite\n\nAmendment 709's non-retroactivity, we should nonetheless remand for\n\nresentencing in light of the amendment. Although a non-retroactive\n\namendment could trigger a remand if that amendment is deemed\n\n\"clarifying\" rather than \"substantive,\" in Godin II we concluded\n\nthat Amendment 709 was substantive and not intended to be applied\n\nretroactively.    522 F.3d at 134.\n\n          Nevertheless, Godin II suggests that another course may\n\nbe available.    Like Ahrendt, Godin had prior convictions for which\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fshe had been sentenced on the same day,8 and, as in this case, the\n\nconvictions had been counted separately in her PSR.        Id.     Also\n\nsimilar to the present case, at the time of Godin's sentencing the\n\npre-Amendment version of the guidelines was in force, and we made\n\nclear in our decision that Godin's GSR remained valid.    Id. at 135.\n\nNevertheless, motivated by the discretion vested in district courts\n\nafter Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586 (2007), to consider the\n\nSentencing   Commission's   current    thinking,   we   remanded   for\n\nresentencing.    We suggested that the amendment was a statement of\n\nthe \"Commission's current policy position . . . [that] may have\n\nsome influence on the judge's ultimate discretionary choice of\n\nsentence.\"   Id. at 136.\n\n          The government argues that taking a similar course here\n\nis not justified and seeks to distinguish this case from Godin II\n\nin three ways.\n\n          First, the government observes that, unlike Godin who\n\npreserved her consolidation argument below, Ahrendt failed to\n\npresent the claim at sentencing and therefore must satisfy the\n\nexacting plain error standard. We do not think this distinction is\n\nof great significance in this case.       We did not dwell on the\n\nstandard of review in our decision to remand for resentencing in\n\nGodin II. Simply put, neither defendant was entitled, under either\n\n\n8\n   The prior offenses at issue were two burglaries of the same\napartment building in the same week, for which she was sentenced on\nthe same day.\n\n                                -23-\n\fa harmless error or plain error standard of review, to a remand\n\nbecause neither could show that an error occurred at sentencing.\n\n            Second, the government argues that Ahrendt, unlike Godin,\n\nnever requested a departure or variant sentence.         We do not think\n\nthat this fact forecloses a remand.        In Godin II, our decision to\n\nremand did not hinge on the fact that Godin sought a departure or\n\nvariant sentence.    Moreover, although the district court in this\n\ncase noted Ahrendt's failure to pursue either of those options at\n\nsentencing, neither did the court suggest that it would be opposed\n\nto granting such a request, had one been made.         Finally, we remain\n\ncognizant of Ahrendt's pro se status at sentencing.          Although this\n\nstatus does not excuse him from the obligation to present colorable\n\narguments at sentencing, under the circumstances of this case we do\n\nnot weigh heavily Ahrendt's pro se failure to press an argument for\n\na departure or variant sentence on the basis that U.S.S.G. §\n\n4A1.2(a)(2), as it stood at the time, resulted in an unduly harsh\n\nsentence.\n\n            Third, the government points out that in Godin II the\n\napplication of Amendment 709 would have prevented the defendant\n\nfrom   being   designated   a   career    offender,   thus   significantly\n\nreducing Godin's Guidelines range.        Therefore, its argument runs,\n\nwe had a greater reason to remand for resentencing in Godin's case\n\nthan here.     Although perhaps not irrelevant, the difference in\n\nimpact on the Guidelines calculation ultimately is a difference in\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fdegree.   In Godin II, we emphasized the posture of the case in\n\nexplaining our decision to remand.       We observed that, \"[T]he\n\nposture of this case is peculiar:   the amendment is not applicable\n\nretroactively, but neither has the pending appeal yet resulted in\n\na final disposition, that is, a disposition that is no longer\n\nsubject to review on direct appeal in any court.\"   Id. at 135.   The\n\nposture of this case is the same.\n\n          Ultimately, given the similarities between this case and\n\nGodin II, we think a remand is justified.    Although the district\n\ncourt is under no obligation to modify Ahrendt's sentence, we\n\nnevertheless think it prudent to allow the court the opportunity to\n\nconsider the Sentencing Commission's updated views.\n\n          For the reasons explained above, we affirm Ahrendt's\n\nconviction but remand for resentencing in light of Amendment 709.\n\n\n\n                   -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                               -25-\n\f           MERRITT, Circuit Judge, dissenting. I am under a duty as\n\nan appellate judge to review the length and reasonablensss of\n\nsentences,   and    I   regard     the   18-year   sentence    here    for   this\n\nnonviolent   crime      as   unreasonably     long    and   not    sufficiently\n\nexplained by the District Court.\n\n           With regard to the 18-year sentence, I do not agree with\n\nthe   District     Court’s   two    level    enhancement      of   Ahrendt   for\n\nperforming a “leadership role” in the drug conspiracy and the\n\ncourt’s failure to address the large disparity (12 and 14 years)\n\nbetween Ahrendt’s sentence and the sentence of the real leaders and\n\npromoters of this group, co-conspirators Brimley and Deloatch. The\n\npre-sentence report indicates that these two leaders brought in the\n\ndrugs from Boston, collected the money and gave the instructions to\n\nthe other members of the conspiracy.                 The pre-sentence report\n\ndescribes Ahrendt’s role in the offense as follows:                “Aherndt both\n\nsells cocaine and other drugs that include Percocet, Vicoden,\n\nOxycontin and Methadone.         In addition to sales, he was engaged in\n\nthe cooking of the powder cocaine.”           Then the pre-sentence report\n\nmakes the following recommendation as to Ahrendt’s sentence:\n\n           Adjustments for Role in the Offense: Pursuant\n           to U.S.S.G. §3B1.1(c), there is a 2 level\n           increase because the defendant was a manager\n           or organizer of a criminal activity that\n           involved five or more participants or was\n           otherwise extensive.    Although this office\n           does not believe that the defendant held as\n           high of management position as Brimley or\n           Deloatch in this conspiracy, he was clearly\n           the organizer of the distribution of crack and\n           was involved in other drug distributions.\n\fAt the sentencing hearing the defendant was pro se and appears to\n\nobject to all of the upward adjustments in the pre-sentence report.\n\nHe has obviously suffered from mental illness and remains on the\n\nborderline, as the sentencing judge clearly recognized:\n\n                      THE COURT: I’m still not quite sure\n               what to make of you. You certainly present as\n               somebody who is somewhat iconoclastic, maybe a\n               bit eccentric, and with a dose of nihilism,\n               and I am not denying that you have a right to\n               your own views about your use of drugs, and\n               there is certainly a certain subsection of\n               American society that would agree with you,\n               but Congress doesn’t.\n\nI   do   not    believe    there      are    sufficient   facts    stated    in   the\n\npresentence       report    or       by   the    court   below    to   justify    the\n\nenhancement.       On this subject, all the sentencing judge said was:\n\n                      Three,   pursuant   to  United   States\n               Sentencing Guideline Section 3B1.1(c), as the\n               defendant was a manager or organizer of a\n               criminal activity that involved five or more\n               participants or was otherwise extensive, there\n               is a two-level increase, bringing the offense\n               level to 34.\n\nThere is no indication of what participants Ahrendt managed or how\n\nhe “organized, led, managed or supervised them.”                  See requirements\n\nof United States Sentencing Guidelines §3B1.1.\n\n               Neither    can    I    find   a   justification     for   a   12-year\n\ndisparity between Ahrendt’s sentence and the real leaders of the\n\ngroup.    It is true that the two leaders pled guilty and did not go\n\nto trial.       But Ahrendt has the right of trial by jury and should\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 27 -\n\fnot be punished for exercising it.9        The sentence also fails to\n\nacknowledge the existence of § 3553(a)(6) which requires the\n\nsentencing   judge   to   take   into   account   the   need   to   “avoid\n\nunwarranted disparity among defendants in the same case or provide\n\na reasonable justification for this disparity.”\n\n\n\n\n9\n   See THE FEDERALIST NO. 83 (Alexander Hamilton) (“The friends and\nadversaries of the plan of the convention, if they agree in nothing\nelse, concur at least in the value they set upon the trial by jury;\nor if there is any difference between them it consists in this:\nthe former regard it as a valuable safeguard to liberty; the latter\nrepresent it as the very palladium of free government.”); see also\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 498 (2000) (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring) (noting that “the jury-trial guarantee was one of the\nleast controversial provisions of the Bill of Rights”).\n\n                                 - 28 -\n\f",

William Ahrendt1 challenges his\n\ncocaine conspiracy conviction and 210-month sentence.                  He alleges\n\nthat the district court committed two errors at trial:                 declining\n\nto order a reevaluation of his competency and excluding evidence of\n\na   psychological   evaluation.         He    also    alleges   that   the   court\n\ncommitted   two   errors   at    sentencing      by    applying   a    leadership\n\nenhancement and by failing to treat certain prior offenses together\n\nwhen evaluating his criminal history.\n\n                                I.    Background\n\n            The following background facts on Ahrendt's role in the\n\ncocaine conspiracy were elicited at Ahrendt's trial.\n\n            During the relevant time, Ahrendt lived in Bangor, Maine,\n\nin an apartment from which he allowed others to \"come and go.\"                  He\n\nsold drugs out of his apartment, and provided drugs for people to\n\nuse while in his apartment.          In November 2003, he met Sandra Hurd,\n\nwho took advantage of Ahrendt's \"very high clientele\" to \"set up\n\nshop\" in his apartment selling drugs.                Hurd solicited two other\n\nindividuals, Randy Brimley and Kelvin Deloatch, for the operation.\n\nHurd, Brimley and Deloatch were generally responsible for bringing\n\nmultiple shipments of cocaine per week from Massachusetts to\n\nBangor, Maine.2\n\n\n1\n  This appeal is captioned \"United States v. Aherndt,\" but we will\nspell appellant's surname as he spelled it at trial: Ahrendt.\n2\n  Other individuals were active in the conspiracy, but their roles\nare not relevant here.\n\n                                       -2-\n\f           On arrival in Bangor, some of the cocaine would be taken\n\nto Ahrendt's apartment, although most of it was stored elsewhere in\n\nBangor.    If there was not enough cocaine at Ahrendt's apartment,\n\nsomeone other than Ahrendt would be dispatched to another location\n\nin Bangor to replenish supplies.      In Ahrendt's apartment, the\n\ncocaine was weighed, packaged and sold to buyers who would come to\n\nthe apartment.   Ahrendt was one of the people who would weigh the\n\ncocaine.   He was also one of the sellers, although Deloatch sold\n\nthe lion's share.    In addition, some of the powder cocaine was\n\ncooked into crack cocaine in the apartment.    Brimley did most of\n\nthe cooking, although Ahrendt also cooked small quantities of\n\npowder into crack. If either Deloatch or Brimley were present, one\n\nof them would take money from the drug sales to store it elsewhere\n\nin Bangor; if not, Ahrendt would hold the money until Deloatch or\n\nBrimley arrived.\n\n           At his trial, Ahrendt acknowledged that he used drugs\n\nhimself, sold drugs, and gave drugs to other people.        He also\n\nacknowledged that he weighed cocaine with his own scales, packaged\n\nit, and cooked powder cocaine into crack.   He testified, however,\n\nthat he was not part of the conspiracy, that he was an \"outsider\"\n\nand \"kept in . . . the dark.\"    He testified that he \"didn't have\n\nany specific arrangements with these individuals . . . .   They came\n\nand went, just like everybody else that came in my door.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f            Several months of police investigation culminated in the\n\narrest of seven people, including Ahrendt, in April 2004.                 After\n\nAhrendt's arrest and his pre-trial incarceration at Fort Devens,\n\nMassachusetts, issues arose as to his competency to stand trial.\n\nOn motion of his counsel, Ahrendt was evaluated by a forensic\n\npsychologist on staff at Fort Devens who submitted a written report\n\nto the court.         This report relied on Ahrendt's mental health\n\nrecords from both the Bangor Mental Health Institute (BMHI) and\n\nfrom Acadia Hospital in Bangor, as well as on interviews with\n\nAhrendt.\n\n            Ahrendt had been hospitalized at BMHI from December 2001\n\nto April 2002.        He was treated for symptoms including suicidal\n\nimpulses, poor concentration and disorganized thoughts; treated\n\nwith antidepressants and an antipsychotic drug; and given multiple\n\ndiagnoses (Major Depressive Disorder, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\n\nand Antisocial Personality Disorder).             Between 2002 and 2004,\n\nAhrendt was treated on an outpatient basis at Acadia Hospital in\n\nBangor   for    \"mood    alterations,    vague    complaints      of   auditory\n\nhallucinations, and multiple suicide threats.\"               He was further\n\ndiagnosed      with   Major   Depression,    Recurrent,      With      Psychotic\n\nFeatures; History of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Not Otherwise\n\nSpecified;      and     Personality    Disorder    with      Histrionic       and\n\nNarcissistic     Features.      He    was   treated   with    a     variety   of\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fpsychotropic     medications.        Neither   set   of   records   discussed\n\nAhrendt's substance use.\n\n            The report posited that because Ahrendt was using drugs\n\nduring the pendency of his prior hospitalizations, his \"degree of\n\ndrug use could possibly explain\" the symptoms reported in his\n\nmedical records.      The report concluded by diagnosing Ahrendt with\n\nPersonality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified and with substance\n\nuse-related diagnoses, but noted that these diagnoses did not\n\n\"appear to be impairing his level of functioning to consult with\n\nhis   attorney   or   make   rational    decisions    regarding     his   legal\n\nmatters.\"\n\n            After the submission of the report, the district court\n\nheld a competency hearing in January 2005.            At that hearing, the\n\nreport was admitted into evidence without objection.3               The court\n\nalso engaged in a discussion with Ahrendt about his competency,\n\nasking if he understood what was happening and explaining the legal\n\nstandard for competency in response to Ahrendt's questions. At the\n\nconclusion of the hearing, the court ruled Ahrendt competent to\n\nstand   trial,    pledging      to   \"remain    diligent    regarding      [the\n\ncompetency] issue during the course of any further proceedings.\"\n\n\n\n\n3\n   Defense counsel mentioned that Ahrendt disagreed with some of\nthe specific statements that Ahrendt had allegedly made to the\npsychologist, but acknowledged that those statements did not affect\nthe conclusions in the report.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f          At around this time, Ahrendt began sending letters to the\n\ncourt.   The letters expounded upon Ahrendt's personal philosophy\n\nand view of the justice system.4      At an April 2005 hearing on an\n\nunrelated issue, the court commented that \"the letters could be\n\ninterpreted as threatening.\"   Ahrendt's counsel responded that the\n\nletters were not threatening, and that Ahrendt was \"a person who\n\njust lives in a different world than the rest of us.\"\n\n          At a May 2005 hearing on a request for a continuance,\n\nAhrendt's counsel reported that his client had been evaluated by\n\nmental health professionals and in counsel's opinion, \"there are\n\nsome serious problems there.\"      At a July hearing on counsel's\n\nmotion to withdraw, which was denied, the court questioned Ahrendt\n\nabout his relationship with counsel. Ahrendt stated, \"it basically\n\ncomes down to, sir, [that] your law stands against my beliefs, and\n\nI'd like to represent my beliefs against your law, and that's it.\n\nMy law stands for love, and yours stands against the Almighty God,\n\nand that's the battle.\"     Ahrendt explained that he wanted to\n\n\n\n\n4\n  We present a representative sampling of excerpts from Ahrendt's\nletters. More than thirty letters were filed with the district\ncourt between April 2005 and January 2007.\n     (1) \"Follow your way sir and impose your justice. I hope your\nsoul was worth it!\"\n     (2) \"I liked our chat in your room of truth. I desire, and\nwould appreciate if we could do it again?\"\n     (3) \"I have already shown the Truth of you and your kind and\nof what is it. HAHAHA! This Trial is 'you' nailing 'your' own\ncoffin shut. For Real. You seem to believe you are what makes up\nReality, the Truth. NOT! Wow, what a lust sir.\"\n\n                                -6-\n\f\"change [the justice] system\" and asked the court, \"Why don't you\n\nhelp me do what I'm trying to accomplish?\"\n\n            As trial approached, Ahrendt's counsel filed a notice of\n\nintent to introduce as expert evidence the testimony of clinical\n\npsychologist Dr. Jeffrey Aston.          Based on interviews with Ahrendt,\n\nDr. Aston had prepared testimony that agreed with the Fort Devens\n\nReport   that   Ahrendt    was   \"technically     competent,\"     and   offered\n\nfurther explanation of Ahrendt's point of view and behavior.\n\n            [Ahrendt] is obviously given to a peculiar\n            turn of mind which interprets everything in\n            terms of a highly abstracted philosophy of\n            life . . . . In Mr. Ahrendt's view, the world\n            consists of persons who are motivated either\n            by negative selfishness (\"Lust\") or positive\n            altruism (\"Love\").       For him, drug use\n            resembles an almost sacramental consumption of\n            what the \"Divine\" Lovingly provides us, while\n            society's war on drugs is a misguided Lust to\n            control what others do.\n\nThe government filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude this\n\ntestimony.      The court agreed with the government and ruled the\n\nproffered     testimony    inadmissible       under   Fed.   R.    Evid.   403,\n\nexplaining that the testimony had \"a significant potential for\n\nconfusing and misleading the jury and causing unfair prejudice.\"\n\nThe   court     noted     that   such     testimony    might      invite   jury\n\nnullification, stating, \"[t]he sincerity of Mr. Ahrendt's belief\n\nthat he is entitled to the 'sacramental consumption' of drugs is\n\nnot properly before the Court.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f          Several weeks before trial, the court permitted Ahrendt\n\nto waive his right to counsel and represent himself, with his\n\nformer counsel serving as standby counsel.              At this time, his\n\ncounsel had expressed concern that Ahrendt would not pursue a\n\nsensible defense strategy. The court specifically asked if counsel\n\nwas requesting a reevaluation of Ahrendt's competency, and counsel\n\nreplied that he could not make such a request \"in good faith.\"\n\n          At trial in September 2005, Ahrendt cross-examined the\n\ngovernment's    witnesses,   eliciting      testimony    bearing     on   the\n\ncredibility of at least one witness, and made a successful hearsay\n\nobjection. Ahrendt also testified in his own defense. Despite his\n\nefforts, the jury convicted Ahrendt of conspiracy to distribute,\n\nand to possess with the intent to distribute, both cocaine and\n\ncocaine base under 21 U.S.C. §§ 846 & 841(a)(2).\n\n          In the presentence investigation report (\"PSR\") prepared\n\nfor Ahrendt's sentencing, he was given a two-level leadership\n\nenhancement    under   U.S.S.G.   §    3B1.1(c)   for   his   role   in   the\n\nconspiracy.    The resulting offense level was thirty-four.          The PSR\n\nalso listed four prior convictions.          Although Ahrendt had been\n\nsentenced for three of those offenses on the same day, and the\n\nthree offenses had occurred within one week of each other and had\n\nsimilar characteristics, each conviction was counted separately, as\n\na \"prior sentence\" under § 4A1.2(a)(2).           Ahrendt was accordingly\n\nawarded eight criminal history points, putting him in Criminal\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fHistory Category (\"CHC\") IV.   See § 4A1.1 (two points awarded for\n\neach prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days).\n\nAhrendt's Guidelines Sentencing Range (\"GSR\"), based on an offense\n\nlevel of thirty-four and a CHC of IV, was 210 - 262 months.\n\n           The court remarked at the commencement of the sentencing\n\nhearing in January 2006 that it wanted to be as fair as possible to\n\nAhrendt, who responded, \"Let me go home?\"   When Ahrendt was asked\n\nif he objected to any of the findings, he stated that he objected\n\nto \"[t]he whole thing.\" The district court responded, \"Defendant's\n\nobjection is noted and overruled\" and the findings of the PSI were\n\nadopted.   Ahrendt was sentenced to the low end of the GSR, 210\n\nmonths' imprisonment, followed by four years of supervised release.\n\nThe court asked Ahrendt if he had any specific objection to those\n\nterms, to which Ahrendt responded, \"Disrespect is disrespect.\n\nThat's all right.\"     The court stated, \"To the extent that is\n\ninterpreted as an objection, the objection's overruled.\"\n\n           On appeal, Ahrendt argues that the district court erred\n\nin declining to order a reevaluation of his competency.    He also\n\nclaims error in the court's exclusion, under Fed. R. Evid. 403, of\n\nthe psychological evaluation prepared by Dr. Aston.   Ahrendt also\n\nalleges sentencing errors in both the leadership enhancement and\n\nthe separate counting of his prior convictions.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f                          II.

This is particularly true in the context of\n\nAhrendt's performance at trial, where he made a successful hearsay\n\nobjection and cross-examined government witnesses in an attempt to\n\nshow that the requirements for proving a conspiracy were not met.\n\nWhile   ultimately        unsuccessful,        his    performance           belies        the\n\ncontention that he was \"unable . . . to assist properly in his\n\ndefense.\"        18    U.S.C.   §   4241.

Moreover,\n\nthe record reveals neither a formal order consolidating the charges\n\nnor any other evidence of formal consolidation.\n\n            Nevertheless, on November 1, 2007, while this appeal was\n\npending,    the   Sentencing   Commission   adopted   a   non-retroactive\n\namendment7 on this topic, in response to conflicts among the\n\ncircuits.     U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(2) (2007) & Supp. to App. C,\n\nAmendment 709 (2007).      The amendment strikes the term \"related\n\ncases\" and the above definition from the 2007 Guidelines, and adds\n\nnew language such that § 4A1.2(a)(2) now reads: \"[P]rior sentences\n\nare counted separately unless (A) the sentences resulted from\n\noffenses contained in the same charging instrument; or (B) the\n\nsentences were imposed on the same day. Count any prior sentence\n\ncovered by (A) or (B) as a single sentence.\" (emphasis added).\n\nBecause Amendment 709 is non-retroactive, however, Ahrendt is not\n\nentitled to the benefit of this amendment which we have observed\n\n\n7\n   Retroactivity of amendments to the Guidelines is determined by\nthe inclusion of such an amendment under U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10(c)\n(2007). If an amendment is so listed, a defendant is permitted to\nmove for a reduction in sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). An\namendment not listed in § 1B1.10(c) does not have retroactive\neffect.   Retroactivity in the Guidelines context is explicitly\ndistinct from the effect of statutory changes. See United States\nv. Havener, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542933\"><a href=\"/opinion/542933/united-states-v-larry-c-havener/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir. 1990) (Breyer, J.)\n(distinguishing \"common-law presumption that the repeal of a\ncriminal statute resulted in the abatement of all prosecutions\nwhich had not reached final disposition in the highest court\nauthorized to review them\" from retroactivity of amendments to\nGuidelines (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).\n\n                                   -21-\n\f\"go[es] beyond any circuit's reading of the previous rule in a\n\nmanner favorable to the defendant.\"       See United States v.

Although the three charges underlying the\n\nconvictions had separate docket numbers, and although he was\n\nsentenced for each conviction separately, all three sentences were\n\nimposed on the same day. See § 4A1.2(a)(2) (\"[P]rior sentences are\n\ncounted separately unless (A) the sentences resulted from offenses\n\ncontained in the same charging instrument; or (B) the sentences\n\nwere imposed on the same day.    Count any prior sentence covered by\n\n(A) or (B) as a single sentence.\").\n\n          Ahrendt    is   foreclosed    from   arguing   that,   despite\n\nAmendment 709's non-retroactivity, we should nonetheless remand for\n\nresentencing in light of the amendment. Although a non-retroactive\n\namendment could trigger a remand if that amendment is deemed\n\n\"clarifying\" rather than \"substantive,\" in Godin II we concluded\n\nthat Amendment 709 was substantive and not intended to be applied\n\nretroactively.    522 F.3d at 134.\n\n          Nevertheless, Godin II suggests that another course may\n\nbe available.    Like Ahrendt, Godin had prior convictions for which\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fshe had been sentenced on the same day,8 and, as in this case, the\n\nconvictions had been counted separately in her PSR.        Id.     Also\n\nsimilar to the present case, at the time of Godin's sentencing the\n\npre-Amendment version of the guidelines was in force, and we made\n\nclear in our decision that Godin's GSR remained valid.    Id. at 135.\n\nNevertheless, motivated by the discretion vested in district courts\n\nafter Gall v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007), to consider the\n\nSentencing   Commission's   current    thinking,   we   remanded   for\n\nresentencing.    We suggested that the amendment was a statement of\n\nthe \"Commission's current policy position . . . [that] may have\n\nsome influence on the judge's ultimate discretionary choice of\n\nsentence.\"   Id. at 136.\n\n          The government argues that taking a similar course here\n\nis not justified and seeks to distinguish this case from Godin II\n\nin three ways.\n\n          First, the government observes that, unlike Godin who\n\npreserved her consolidation argument below, Ahrendt failed to\n\npresent the claim at sentencing and therefore must satisfy the\n\nexacting plain error standard. We do not think this distinction is\n\nof great significance in this case.       We did not dwell on the\n\nstandard of review in our decision to remand for resentencing in\n\nGodin II. Simply put, neither defendant was entitled, under either\n\n\n8\n   The prior offenses at issue were two burglaries of the same\napartment building in the same week, for which she was sentenced on\nthe same day.\n\n                                -23-\n\fa harmless error or plain error standard of review, to a remand\n\nbecause neither could show that an error occurred at sentencing.\n\n            Second, the government argues that Ahrendt, unlike Godin,\n\nnever requested a departure or variant sentence.         We do not think\n\nthat this fact forecloses a remand.        In Godin II, our decision to\n\nremand did not hinge on the fact that Godin sought a departure or\n\nvariant sentence.    Moreover, although the district court in this\n\ncase noted Ahrendt's failure to pursue either of those options at\n\nsentencing, neither did the court suggest that it would be opposed\n\nto granting such a request, had one been made.         Finally, we remain\n\ncognizant of Ahrendt's pro se status at sentencing.          Although this\n\nstatus does not excuse him from the obligation to present colorable\n\narguments at sentencing, under the circumstances of this case we do\n\nnot weigh heavily Ahrendt's pro se failure to press an argument for\n\na departure or variant sentence on the basis that U.S.S.G. §\n\n4A1.2(a)(2), as it stood at the time, resulted in an unduly harsh\n\nsentence.\n\n            Third, the government points out that in Godin II the\n\napplication of Amendment 709 would have prevented the defendant\n\nfrom   being   designated   a   career    offender,   thus   significantly\n\nreducing Godin's Guidelines range.        Therefore, its argument runs,\n\nwe had a greater reason to remand for resentencing in Godin's case\n\nthan here.     Although perhaps not irrelevant, the difference in\n\nimpact on the Guidelines calculation ultimately is a difference in\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fdegree.   In Godin II, we emphasized the posture of the case in\n\nexplaining our decision to remand.       We observed that, \"[T]he\n\nposture of this case is peculiar:   the amendment is not applicable\n\nretroactively, but neither has the pending appeal yet resulted in\n\na final disposition, that is, a disposition that is no longer\n\nsubject to review on direct appeal in any court.\"   Id. at 135.   The\n\nposture of this case is the same.\n\n          Ultimately, given the similarities between this case and\n\nGodin II, we think a remand is justified.    Although the district\n\ncourt is under no obligation to modify Ahrendt's sentence, we\n\nnevertheless think it prudent to allow the court the opportunity to\n\nconsider the Sentencing Commission's updated views.\n\n          For the reasons explained above, we affirm Ahrendt's\n\nconviction but remand for resentencing in light of Amendment 709.\n\n\n\n                   -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                               -25-\n\f           MERRITT, Circuit Judge, dissenting. I am under a duty as\n\nan appellate judge to review the length and reasonablensss of\n\nsentences,   and    I   regard     the   18-year   sentence    here    for   this\n\nnonviolent   crime      as   unreasonably     long    and   not    sufficiently\n\nexplained by the District Court.\n\n           With regard to the 18-year sentence, I do not agree with\n\nthe   District     Court’s   two    level    enhancement      of   Ahrendt   for\n\nperforming a “leadership role” in the drug conspiracy and the\n\ncourt’s failure to address the large disparity (12 and 14 years)\n\nbetween Ahrendt’s sentence and the sentence of the real leaders and\n\npromoters of this group, co-conspirators Brimley and Deloatch. The\n\npre-sentence report indicates that these two leaders brought in the\n\ndrugs from Boston, collected the money and gave the instructions to\n\nthe other members of the conspiracy.                 The pre-sentence report\n\ndescribes Ahrendt’s role in the offense as follows:                “Aherndt both\n\nsells cocaine and other drugs that include Percocet, Vicoden,\n\nOxycontin and Methadone.         In addition to sales, he was engaged in\n\nthe cooking of the powder cocaine.”           Then the pre-sentence report\n\nmakes the following recommendation as to Ahrendt’s sentence:\n\n           Adjustments for Role in the Offense: Pursuant\n           to U.S.S.G. §3B1.1(c), there is a 2 level\n           increase because the defendant was a manager\n           or organizer of a criminal activity that\n           involved five or more participants or was\n           otherwise extensive.    Although this office\n           does not believe that the defendant held as\n           high of management position as Brimley or\n           Deloatch in this conspiracy, he was clearly\n           the organizer of the distribution of crack and\n           was involved in other drug distributions.\n\fAt the sentencing hearing the defendant was pro se and appears to\n\nobject to all of the upward adjustments in the pre-sentence report.\n\nHe has obviously suffered from mental illness and remains on the\n\nborderline, as the sentencing judge clearly recognized:\n\n                      THE COURT: I’m still not quite sure\n               what to make of you. You certainly present as\n               somebody who is somewhat iconoclastic, maybe a\n               bit eccentric, and with a dose of nihilism,\n               and I am not denying that you have a right to\n               your own views about your use of drugs, and\n               there is certainly a certain subsection of\n               American society that would agree with you,\n               but Congress doesn’t.\n\nI   do   not    believe    there      are    sufficient   facts    stated    in   the\n\npresentence       report    or       by   the    court   below    to   justify    the\n\nenhancement.       On this subject, all the sentencing judge said was:\n\n                      Three,   pursuant   to  United   States\n               Sentencing Guideline Section 3B1.1(c), as the\n               defendant was a manager or organizer of a\n               criminal activity that involved five or more\n               participants or was otherwise extensive, there\n               is a two-level increase, bringing the offense\n               level to 34.\n\nThere is no indication of what participants Ahrendt managed or how\n\nhe “organized, led, managed or supervised them.”                  See requirements\n\nof United States Sentencing Guidelines §3B1.1.\n\n               Neither    can    I    find   a   justification     for   a   12-year\n\ndisparity between Ahrendt’s sentence and the real leaders of the\n\ngroup.    It is true that the two leaders pled guilty and did not go\n\nto trial.       But Ahrendt has the right of trial by jury and should\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 27 -\n\fnot be punished for exercising it.9        The sentence also fails to\n\nacknowledge the existence of § 3553(a)(6) which requires the\n\nsentencing   judge   to   take   into   account   the   need   to   “avoid\n\nunwarranted disparity among defendants in the same case or provide\n\na reasonable justification for this disparity.”\n\n\n\n\n9\n   See THE FEDERALIST NO. 83 (Alexander Hamilton) (“The friends and\nadversaries of the plan of the convention, if they agree in nothing\nelse, concur at least in the value they set upon the trial by jury;\nor if there is any difference between them it consists in this:\nthe former regard it as a valuable safeguard to liberty; the latter\nrepresent it as the very palladium of free government.”); see also\nApprendi v.
