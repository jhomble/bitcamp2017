The government has moved  for summary\n                    \n\ndisposition of this appeal under Loc. R. 27.1.  We agree that\n\nthere is no  substantial issue presented,  and we affirm  the\n\njudgment below.\n\n          Defendant pleaded guilty to a one-count  indictment\n\ncharging  possession of  a firearm  by a  convicted  felon in\n\nviolation  of 18  U.S.C.      922(g)(1),  924(a)(2).    Under\n\nU.S.S.G.  2K2.1(a)(2),  his base  offense level  was properly\n\ncalculated at Level 24 \"if [he] had at least two prior felony\n\nconvictions of  either a  crime of violence  or a  controlled\n\nsubstance offense.\"   The presentence  report (\"PSI\")  listed\n\ntwo such convictions --  a drug offense  and a burglary of  a\n\ndwelling.       Defendant    initially   objected    to   the\n\ncharacterization  of the burglary as a  crime of violence and\n\nits use for  sentence enhancement purposes.   Defense counsel\n\nlater   withdrew   these   objections,  however,   and   with\n\ndefendant's  approval, conceded the base offense level of 24.\n\n          Defendant now attempts to reverse the effect of his\n\nvoluntary  concession  by  arguing that  the  court committed\n\nplain error in omitting from  its findings of fact an express\n\ncitation  to  the  PSI paragraph  which  listed  the burglary\n\nconviction.   The argument erroneously equates the absence of\n\na numerical citation with a failure to make factual findings.\n\nThe  court   specifically  found  the   relevant  fact,  that\n\n                             -2-\n\ndefendant  had two prior  qualifying convictions.   It relied\n\nupon the defendant's concession, expressly reiterating  among\n\nits  written  findings  that  defendant  had   withdrawn  his\n\nobjections to  considering the  burglary for  the purpose  of\n\nsentence  enhancement.   In  addition,  the court's  judgment\n\nadopted the factual findings of the PSI. \"As a general rule a\n\ntrial court lawfully  may make implicit findings  with regard\n\nto sentencing  matters, incorporating  by reference  suitably\n\ndetailed suggestions limned in the PSI  Report or advanced by\n\na  party.\"   United States  v. Tavano,  1993 U.S.  App. LEXIS\n                                     \n\n33879, at *18  (1st Cir. Dec. 29,  1993) (citing cases).   No\n\nparticular citation form is required.\n\n          Accordingly, we grant the government's motion under\n\nLoc. R. 27.1 and affirm the judgment below.  \n                       \n\n                             -3-\n",
