Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n         [Hon. Kenneth P. Neiman, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Edward J. McDonough, Jr., with whom Maurice M. Cahillane and\nEgan, Flanagan and Cohen, P.C. were on brief, for appellant.\n     Mark A. Hickernell, with whom Alan J. McDonald and McDonald &\nAssociates were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                        November 21, 2005\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.        In this case, the district court\n\nconfirmed   an    arbitration    award    that    directed    a   hospital   to\n\nreinstate an intensive-care nurse.         The hospital, citing the pains\n\nthat must be taken by health-care professionals to restrict the\n\ndistribution of controlled substances, appeals on the ground that\n\nthe reinstatement order transgresses public policy. After studying\n\nthe matter, we agree with the district court that the arbitral\n\naward should be confirmed.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            We start by rehearsing the underlying facts.              We then\n\nlimn what transpired before the arbitrator and the district court,\n\nrespectively.\n\n            Plaintiff-appellant      Mercy       Hospital    (the   Hospital)\n\noperates    an    acute   care   hospital     facility       in   Springfield,\n\nMassachusetts. Defendant-appellee Massachusetts Nurses Association\n\n(the MNA) is the authorized collective bargaining representative of\n\nthe nurses who toil there.       The Hospital and the MNA are (and were\n\nat all relevant times) parties to a collective bargaining agreement\n\n(CBA).   The CBA recognizes the Hospital's right to \"discipline or\n\ndischarge employees for just cause\" and establishes a multi-step\n\ngrievance procedure, culminating in binding arbitration, for the\n\nresolution of employment-related disputes between the Hospital and\n\nthe nurses.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           The Hospital hired Nancy Dufault as a nurse in 1977.                In\n\nthe pertinent time frame (2001-2002), Dufault worked the twelve-\n\nhour night shift in the intensive care unit (ICU).                Part of her\n\nresponsibilities included administration of Ativan, morphine, and\n\nother controlled substances designed to relieve pain or anxiety.\n\nDufault also served as a preceptor charged with ground-level\n\noversight of fledgling ICU nurses (orientees).\n\n           Over   her       estimable    quarter-century     career,    Dufault\n\ndeveloped a reputation as an industrious, highly skilled nurse. In\n\n1995, the Hospital gave her a special commendation for her service\n\nas a preceptor.       Her last performance evaluation, prepared shortly\n\nbefore the events in question occurred, describes her as \"a very\n\nstrong   expert   critical     care     nurse\"   and   remarks   that   she   had\n\nexceeded hospital standards in a number of performance areas.\n\n           In the fall of 2001, storm clouds gathered. The Hospital\n\nrevised its system for administering medication to ICU patients and\n\ninstalled an Omnicell machine in that unit.              The machine functions\n\nas a computerized medicine cabinet.           To obtain medication, a nurse\n\nmust   enter   into    an   electronic    keypad   her    personal   code,    the\n\npatient's personal code, the type of drug, and the dosage.                    The\n\nOmnicell processes this information and automatically unlocks the\n\ncompartment housing the requested medication.\n\n           After administering the medicine to the patient, the\n\nnurse records the time, the identity of the drug, and the dosage in\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fa separate database known as SMS.             Each night, a patient-specific\n\nmedicine administration schedule (MAS) displaying the data entered\n\ninto the SMS system is printed out and filed in the patient's\n\nchart.   The purpose of this double-entry regime is to enhance the\n\nHospital's     ability    to    track   and    correlate      requests   for   and\n\nadministration of medications in the ICU.\n\n            In June of 2002 a nursing supervisor approached Dufault\n\nabout a possible discrepancy in the dual entries for a patient in\n\nher   care.       The     supervisor      accepted    Dufault's     on-the-spot\n\nexplanation and allowed the incident to pass without further\n\ninquiry.\n\n            The following month, the same supervisor detected what\n\nappeared to be inconsistencies between the Omnicell record and the\n\nMAS of one of Dufault's patients.               The supervisor conducted an\n\nindependent review of Dufault's entries into the Omnicell and SMS\n\nsystems.    Based on that review, the supervisor and a nurse who had\n\nassisted her concluded that, on a number of occasions, Dufault had\n\nwithdrawn     medication    from    the    Omnicell    without    recording     an\n\noffsetting entry for administration in the SMS system.                         They\n\nrelated their conclusions to the director of nursing, Mary Brown,\n\nwho   placed    Dufault    on    administrative       leave    pending   further\n\ninvestigation.\n\n            On August 27, 2002, Brown met with Dufault, an MNA\n\nrepresentative, and the two nurses who had conducted the initial\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\freview.    Brown     presented    Dufault    with   the   Omnicell     and   SMS\n\nprintouts for five different patients and asked her to explain the\n\ninconsistences in her entries.          With respect to an instance in\n\nwhich she had withdrawn eighteen milligrams of Ativan but had made\n\nno record of dispensing such a dose to the patient, Dufault stated\n\nthat she had retrieved the unusually large quantity of Ativan so\n\nthat she could prepare an intravenous drip bag and avoid having to\n\nreturn periodically to the Omnicell to obtain the smaller doses\n\nprescribed in the physician's orders.            The other four instances\n\ndated back nearly two months, and Dufault complained that, without\n\nforewarning, she could not recall the particulars. She speculated,\n\nhowever, that incomplete documentation by her and an orientee\n\nprobably explained the discrepancies.          The meeting ended on that\n\nnote.\n\n           Brown convened a second meeting two days later.                   She\n\nregarded Dufault's explanation of the discrepancy involving the\n\neighteen   milligrams    of   Ativan    as   implausible;       the   patient's\n\nintravenous drip had been discontinued several hours before Dufault\n\nwithdrew the Ativan, and the physician's orders called for the drug\n\nto be injected rather than administered by intravenous drip.\n\nDufault stood by her previous account.               Brown then presented\n\nDufault with two more alleged inconsistencies in her entries and\n\nserved her with a termination notice.               The stated reason for\n\ntermination   was:     \"Failure    to   adhere      to    the   standards     of\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fnarcotic/controlled      substance   administration      —     suspected    drug\n\ndiversion.\"\n\n            Following Dufault's discharge, the MNA filed a grievance\n\non her behalf.       The parties eventually submitted two imbricated\n\nmatters to binding arbitration: (i) whether there was just cause\n\nfor Dufault's termination and (ii) if not, what consequences should\n\nensue.\n\n            The arbitrator conducted an evidentiary hearing.                 She\n\nsubsequently issued an opinion concluding that the preponderance of\n\nthe evidence did not support the claim that Dufault had engaged in\n\ndrug diversion but, rather, supported her repeated denials of\n\nculpability.    In the arbitrator's view, Dufault's testimony that\n\nthe discrepancies were most likely the result of documentation\n\nerrors was worthy of belief for four reasons: (i) Dufault and other\n\nnurses testified credibly that they commonly caught up on their SMS\n\nentries during breaks or at the end of their shifts when they could\n\nnot always remember the exact medications and dosages administered;\n\n(ii)     Dufault's   explanation     of    the    probable     cause   of    the\n\ndiscrepancies had remained consistent throughout the investigation\n\nand the grievance process; (iii) Dufault's testimony that ICU\n\nnurses    occasionally    deviated    from       established    documentation\n\nprotocols had \"been more corroborated than rebutted\" by the other\n\nevidence in the case; and (iv) there was absolutely no proof to\n\nsubstantiate the Hospital's accusation that the discrepancies in\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fthe records were attributable to the diversion of drugs.1              The\n\narbitrator also found that Dufault had received no formal training\n\nas a preceptor and that the Hospital had no established policy as\n\nto which nurse — the preceptor or the orientee — was responsible\n\nfor documenting the medications administered to patients who were\n\nunder their joint care.\n\n            With specific reference to the Ativan incident, the\n\narbitrator accepted the testimony of two non-party witnesses that\n\nit was common practice for ICU nurses to prepare intravenous drip\n\nbags well in advance of the time when they would be needed (either\n\nfor use during their own or succeeding shifts).           The arbitrator\n\nalso credited testimony that although it was not good practice, a\n\nnurse    might   deviate   from   a   doctor's   orders   and   administer\n\nmedication intravenously rather than by syringe as a time-saving\n\ndevice.\n\n            On the basis of these findings, the arbitrator concluded\n\nin pertinent part:\n\n            The Hospital failed to carry its burden . . .\n            in this matter.     The preponderance of the\n            evidence in the record supports [Dufault's]\n            denial of any culpability with respect to the\n            Hospital's charges of drug diversion. . . .\n            [Dufault] credibly testified as to what she\n            believed were the most likely actions she took\n            (or did not take) with respect to the\n            narcotics she removed from the Omnicell . . .\n\n\n     1\n      In this vein, the arbitrator noted that Dufault had submitted\nto three drug tests, each of which had proved negative for the\npresence of Ativan, morphine, or any other controlled substance.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f            .   In light of the Hospital's failure to\n            submit a preponderance of evidence that\n            contradicts [Dufault's] account, . . . the\n            termination . . . is found to be without just\n            cause.\n\nThe arbitrator then moved to the remedy question and, taking into\n\naccount the idiosyncratic facts of the case, ordered the Hospital\n\nto    reinstate   Dufault   with   back    pay   and   without   any   loss   of\n\nseniority.\n\n            The Hospital was not pleased.              It asked the federal\n\ndistrict court to vacate the award on the ground that reinstating\n\nDufault would violate public policy.              The MNA cross-filed for\n\nconfirmation of the award. The district judge referred the case to\n\na magistrate judge, see 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B), who recommended\n\nconfirmation.     On de novo review, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b), the\n\ndistrict judge adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation and\n\nentered judgment for the MNA.2       This timely appeal ensued.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n            Where, as here, the employer and the union have bargained\n\nfor an arbitrator's construction of a CBA, a court's authority to\n\nvacate an arbitral award is closely circumscribed.                Boston Med.\n\nCtr. v. SEIU, Local 285, 260 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2001); Teamsters\n\nLocal Union No. 42 v. Supervalu, Inc., 212 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir.\n\n\n       2\n      For simplicity's sake, we do not distinguish hereafter\nbetween the magistrate judge and the district judge but, rather,\ntake an institutional view and refer to the determinations below as\nthose of the district court.        See, e.g., United States v.\nMaldonado, 356 F.3d 130, 134 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                     -8-\n\f2000).    Thus, a party who challenges an arbitrator's award in the\n\nlabor-management context must be prepared to undertake a steep\n\nuphill climb.       Typically, the challenge will fail if the award\n\n\"draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement\" rather\n\nthan from the arbitrator's \"own brand of industrial justice.\"                USW\n\nv. Enter. Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960).              \"[A]s long\n\nas the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the\n\ncontract,\" the fact that he or she may have made a mistake — even\n\na serious mistake — will not afford a basis for defenestrating the\n\naward.    United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S.\n\n29, 38 (1987).      That remains true whether the mistake concerns a\n\nmatter of fact or a matter of law.        Id.\n\n           There are, however, a few exceptions to the general rule\n\nthat the arbitrator has the last word.               See 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)\n\n(codifying    certain    exceptions);     Supervalu,    212     F.3d   at    66\n\n(discussing other exceptions).       One such exception, which traces\n\nits roots to the common law doctrine that courts may refuse to\n\nenforce   illegal    contracts,   holds   that   a   court    may   vacate   an\n\narbitral award that violates public policy.            W.R. Grace & Co. v.\n\nLocal Union 759, Int'l Union of United Rubber Workers, 461 U.S.\n\n757, 766 (1983).      This exception is narrow.        The mere fact that\n\n\"general considerations of supposed public interests\" might be\n\noffended by an arbitral award is not enough to make the exception\n\navailable.    Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fRather, the award must violate an \"explicit . . .           well defined and\n\ndominant\" public policy, as ascertained \"by reference to . . . laws\n\nand legal precedents.\" Id. (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n             In the context of an arbitration award that reinstates a\n\nfired employee, the question is not whether the charged conduct\n\noffends public policy or whether some remedy short of unconditional\n\nreinstatement (say, a probationary period or a suspension without\n\npay) might have been preferable.             Rather, the sole question is\n\nwhether the award itself — the order for reinstatement — gives\n\noffense.     See E. Assoc'd Coal Corp. v. UMW, Dist. 17, 531 U.S. 57,\n\n62-63 (2000).    We turn, then, to that question and ask whether the\n\norder   to   reinstate   Dufault   as   an    ICU   nurse   contravenes   some\n\nexplicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy as ascertained\n\nby reference to the positive law of Massachusetts (which, of\n\ncourse, includes applicable federal law).            See id.\n\n             This inquiry is not free-form.          In determining whether\n\nDufault's reinstatement contravenes Massachusetts's declared public\n\npolicy, we cannot forget that the parties, through the collective\n\nbargaining process, chose arbitration as the preferred means of\n\nresolving workplace disputes.           Accordingly, we must read the\n\npertinent statutes and regulations \"in light of background labor\n\nlaw policy that favors determination of disciplinary questions\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fthrough arbitration when chosen as a result of labor-management\n\nnegotiation.\"    Id. at 65.\n\n           The Hospital relies on federal and state statutes and a\n\nstate regulatory scheme to undergird its claim that Massachusetts\n\nhas an explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy in favor\n\nof restricting the distribution of controlled substances.              See\n\ngenerally 21 U.S.C. §§ 801-971; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C.           It notes\n\nthat these provisions collectively establish strict controls on the\n\nhandling of controlled substances and evince a strong concern for\n\npreventing the unauthorized distribution of such substances by\n\nhealth-care professionals.        Zeroing in on the facts of this case,\n\nthe Hospital emphasizes that the state's regulations governing the\n\nlicensure of nurses set out strict standards of conduct with\n\nrespect to the administration of controlled substances.            See 244\n\nMass. Code Regs. 9.03.        Pertinently, those regulations require\n\nnurses to (i) comply with the Controlled Substances Act, Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 94C; (ii) maintain the security of controlled substances;\n\n(iii) refrain from unlawfully obtaining or possessing controlled\n\nsubstances; (iv) administer drugs only as prescribed; and (v)\n\ndocument   the   handling,     administration,     and   destruction    of\n\ncontrolled substances.     244 Mass. Code Regs. 9.03(6)(a)(8), (35),\n\n(37), (38), (39).\n\n           Building   on   this    elaborate   foundation,   the   Hospital\n\nasserts that Dufault breached the regulations by diverting drugs\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\faway   from   patients,   by   failing   properly     to   document   the\n\ndispensation of medications, and by administering Ativan through a\n\nmedium other than that prescribed in the physician's orders.\n\nConsequently, the Hospital says, the arbitrator's award offends\n\npublic policy because it reinstates a serial regulatory violator to\n\na highly sensitive position.\n\n          The principal problem with this line of argument is that\n\nit ignores the arbitrator's resolution of disputed issues.        With a\n\nfew limited exceptions not relevant here, an inquiring court is\n\nbound by an arbitrator's findings of fact.          See El Dorado Tech.\n\nServs., Inc. v. Union Gen. De Trabajadores, 961 F.2d 317, 320 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).    Once due deference is accorded to the arbitrator's\n\nfactual findings here, the Hospital's argument withers.\n\n          The Hospital suggests that the arbitrator glossed over\n\nDufault's unauthorized diversion of drugs and that even accidental\n\ndiversion is serious business.    After stuffing this straw man, the\n\nHospital proceeds to shred it, telling us that because Dufault\n\nimproperly diverted drugs in contravention of the state regulatory\n\nscheme, reinstating her to a sensitive position violates public\n\npolicy.   This construct overlooks that the arbitrator, far from\n\nglossing over the discrepancies in the Omnicell and SMS records,\n\nexplicitly found that the Hospital had failed to prove that Dufault\n\ndiverted any drugs away from patients.     Thus, even if the mandated\n\nreinstatement of a nurse found to have deliberately diverted drugs\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fmight violate an explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy\n\n— and we intimate no view as to whether such a policy has been\n\nestablished — the mandated reinstatement of a nurse who has been\n\nexonerated of all charges of intentional drug diversion, such as\n\nDufault, plainly would not.        Cf. Misco, 484 U.S. at 44 (refusing to\n\nvacate a reinstatement order when the employer had failed to prove\n\nits allegations of employee misconduct).\n\n          The Hospital's attempts to tease a violation of public\n\npolicy out of Dufault's documentation errors and her use of an\n\nunauthorized     method     of     administering     Ativan      are     equally\n\nunconvincing.        It argues that failure properly to account for\n\ncontrolled substances, even if not deliberate, is nevertheless a\n\ngrave matter. While we agree with that premise — Dufault's conduct\n\nseems to have violated the Massachusetts nursing regulations, see,\n\ne.g., 244 Mass. Code Regs. 9.03(38)-(39) — we do not accept the\n\nHospital's     conclusion   that    this    fact   somehow     undermines    the\n\nreinstatement order. After all, this appeal tests only whether the\n\nreinstatement award, on the facts as found by the arbitrator,\n\ncontravenes an explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy.\n\nSee E. Assoc'd Coal, 531 U.S. at 62-63.            Once the issue is framed\n\nin that manner, it becomes nose-on-the-face plain that the Hospital\n\nhas   failed    to    establish    any   barrier    at   all    to     Dufault's\n\nreinstatement.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f            Indeed,   the     Hospital     has   not    identified    a   single\n\niteration of positive law that prohibits the reinstatement of a\n\nnurse   who,   without      causing     injury   to    patients,   made   a   few\n\ndocumentation errors or deviated slightly from doctors' orders on\n\na single occasion in a long and distinguished career. This failure\n\nstrongly suggests that the reinstatement order does not violate\n\npublic policy.   See id. at 66 (relying heavily on the fact that the\n\nreinstatement order did not violate a \"specific provision of any\n\nlaw or regulation\" in concluding that the order did not run\n\ncontrary to public policy); Boston Med. Ctr., 260 F.3d at 25\n\n(similar).\n\n            To be sure, there is reason to believe that an employer\n\nis not invariably required to point to a specific provision of\n\npositive law in order to bring a case within the ambit of the\n\npublic policy exception.           See E. Assoc'd Coal, 531 U.S. at 63\n\n(dictum).      But    cf.    id.   at    67-69   (Scalia,    J.,     concurring)\n\n(questioning this view).       In a prior case in which a reinstatement\n\norder did not breach a specific provision of positive law, we\n\nrequired the employer to show that the reinstatement order subsumed\n\nemployee conduct so egregious that resumed employment would offend\n\nsome deep-rooted public policy.           See Boston Med. Ctr., 260 F.3d at\n\n25.   That precedent does not advance the Hospital's cause.\n\n            In endeavoring to make the showing that Boston Medical\n\nCenter requires, an employer cannot relitigate the facts as found\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fby the arbitrator.     See Misco, 484 U.S. at 44-45.            In this case,\n\nbased largely on the testimony of the Hospital's own witnesses, the\n\narbitrator found that Dufault was a competent, hard-working nurse\n\nwho had exceeded her employer's standards for many years; that\n\nneither Dufault's documentation bevues nor the single instance of\n\nher improper administration of Ativan had caused any harm to\n\npatients; that her explanation for the discrepancies in the records\n\nwas credible; and that, in all events, there was no evidence of\n\nmissing medication, let alone drug diversion.             The arbitrator did\n\nnot find that Dufault posed a risk of harm to patients, that she\n\nwas   incapable   of   properly   documenting       the   administration   of\n\nmedication, or that she had displayed a pattern of failing to\n\ncomply with doctors' orders.\n\n           We are constrained to credit the various parts of this\n\nfactual assessment.3      El Dorado Tech. Servs., 961 F.2d at 320.\n\nDoing so, we find no principled basis for concluding that Dufault's\n\nunderlying   conduct    was   such    as    to   render   her   reinstatement\n\noffensive to public policy.       See MidMich. Reg'l Med. Ctr. — Clare\n\nv. Prof'l Employees Div. of Local 79, SEIU, 183 F.3d 497, 504 (6th\n\nCir. 1999) (\"Even highly skilled professionals err on occasion, and\n\nwe think it clear that it cannot violate . . . public policy . . .\n\n\n\n      3\n      We note, in passing, that this assessment does not seem to be\nchimerical. During the pendency of this appeal, the Massachusetts\nBoard of Registration in Nursing dismissed the Hospital's complaint\nagainst Dufault for insufficient evidence.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fto contract to retain a nurse guilty of committing some acts of\n\ncarelessness.\").\n\n            In arguing for the opposite result, the Hospital relies\n\non a trio of decisions that vacated reinstatement awards under the\n\npublic policy exception. See Russell Mem'l Hosp. Ass'n v. USW, 720\n\nF. Supp. 583 (E.D. Mich. 1989); City of Boston v. Boston Police\n\nPatrolmen's Ass'n, 824 N.E.2d 855 (Mass. 2005); Ill. Nurses Ass'n\n\nv. Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ill., 741 N.E.2d 1014 (Ill. 2001).             A\n\ncourt must be wary of reliance on precedents which, like these\n\nthree decisions, involve state policies different than the one at\n\nissue.    See Boston Med. Ctr., 260 F.3d at 25 n.7 (disregarding the\n\nplaintiff's citation of \"conclusions of other courts that the\n\npublic policies of other states forbid the reinstatement of an\n\nemployee\" in factually dissimilar cases).        At any rate, the cases\n\ncited by the Hospital are readily distinguishable.               In each of\n\nthem, the affected employee committed acts far more blameworthy\n\nthan those that the arbitrator attributed to Dufault.        See Russell\n\nMem'l Hosp., 720 F. Supp. at 587 (involving a nurse who was guilty\n\nof negligence and insubordination and who had \"a propensity for\n\nmisconduct\"); Boston Police, 824 N.E.2d at 859 (involving a police\n\nofficer    who   had   intentionally   filed   false   charges    and   then\n\ncommitted perjury); Ill. Nurses, 741 N.E.2d at 1023-24 (involving\n\nan \"inattentive . . . [and] . . . below average\" nurse who had\n\n\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fendangered the lives of two patients, intentionally falsified a\n\npatient's chart, and provided negligent care).\n\n            A much more instructive case is Boston Medical Center, in\n\nwhich an arbitrator ordered the reinstatement of a nurse whose\n\nslipshod care had resulted in a patient's death.         260 F.3d at 18-\n\n20.   Relying on the nurse's unblemished ten-year work record and\n\nthe arbitrator's finding that she had not \"willfully or callously\n\nprovided substandard care,\" we concluded that the reinstatement\n\norder did not transgress Massachusetts's public policy. Id. at 25.\n\nThe facts in the instant case are considerably more favorable to\n\nthe employee than the facts in Boston Medical Center; after all,\n\nthe arbitrator determined not only that Dufault had achieved an\n\nexemplary    twenty-five-year   nursing   career   but   also   that   her\n\nrelatively minor miscues had not threatened the welfare of any\n\npatients.\n\n            Our refusal to vacate the reinstatement order in Boston\n\nMedical Center adumbrates the result we must reach here: upholding\n\nthe district court's confirmation of the arbitrator's reinstatement\n\norder.      While a single documentation or dispensing error may\n\ncontravene the state's nursing regulations, not every such error or\n\nset of errors necessarily furnishes just cause for termination of\n\na nurse's employment.    Context is important.     Here, the nature of\n\nthe errors, the employee's history, the lack of any harm to\n\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fpatients, and the other circumstances as found by the arbitrator\n\npersuade us that reinstatement is not an affront to public policy.4\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further.     In this matter, the arbitrator\n\nsupportably found that the Hospital had cashiered Dufault without\n\njust cause and ordered her reinstatement.         The Hospital's attempt\n\nto upset that award is unavailing: although an employer may secure\n\nvacation of an arbitrator's reinstatement order in the rare case in\n\nwhich the employer can show that the order itself transgresses an\n\nexplicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy, the Hospital\n\nhas wholly failed to bring this case within the isthmian confines\n\nof that doctrine.\n\n               We understand and appreciate the Hospital's concern with\n\naccountability for dangerous drugs.         Each case, however, must be\n\njudged on its own facts.        Here, the arbitrator appears to have\n\nweighed that concern in the balance. Given the idiosyncratic facts\n\nof the case, we are not at liberty to disturb her decision.         What\n\nmay transpire in different circumstances or if Dufault proves to be\n\na repeat offender is, of course, an open question.\n\n\n       4\n      At oral argument in this court, the Hospital suggested for\nthe first time that the arbitrator erred in not imposing some\nlesser penalty once she found discharge unwarranted. This argument\nwas not made in the district court and is, therefore, not properly\nbefore us. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n1990). In all events, the sole question raised by this appeal is\nwhether the reinstatement order offends public policy. That does\nnot encompass the question of whether the imposition of some remedy\nshort of unconditional reinstatement might have been desirable.\n\n                                   -18-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -19-\n\f",

The hospital, citing the pains that must be taken by health-care professionals to restrict the distribution of controlled substances, appeals on the ground that the reinstatement order transgresses public policy. After studying the matter, we agree with the district court that the arbitral award should be confirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by rehearsing the underlying facts. We then limn what transpired before the arbitrator and the district court, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellant Mercy Hospital (the Hospital) operates an acute care hospital facility in Springfield, Massachusetts. Defendant-appellee Massachusetts Nurses Association (the MNA) is the authorized collective bargaining representative of the nurses who toil there. The Hospital and the MNA are (and were at all relevant times) parties to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The CBA recognizes the Hospital's right to \"discipline or discharge employees for just cause\" and establishes a multi-step grievance procedure, culminating in binding arbitration, for the resolution of employment-related disputes between the Hospital and the nurses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital hired Nancy Dufault as a nurse in 1977. In the pertinent time frame (2001-2002), Dufault worked the twelve-hour night shift in the intensive care unit (ICU). Part of her responsibilities included administration of Ativan, morphine, and other controlled substances designed to relieve pain or anxiety. Dufault also served as a preceptor charged with ground-level oversight of fledgling ICU nurses (orientees).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over her estimable quarter-century career, Dufault developed a reputation as an industrious, highly skilled nurse. In 1995, the Hospital gave her a special commendation for her service as a preceptor. Her last performance evaluation, prepared shortly before the events in question occurred, describes her as \"a very strong expert critical care nurse\" and remarks that she had exceeded hospital standards in a number of performance areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 2001, storm clouds gathered. The Hospital revised its system for administering medication to ICU patients and installed an Omnicell machine in that unit. The machine functions as a computerized medicine cabinet. To obtain medication, a nurse must enter into an electronic keypad her personal code, the patient's personal code, the type of drug, and the dosage. The Omnicell processes this information and automatically unlocks the compartment housing the requested medication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After administering the medicine to the patient, the nurse records the time, the identity of the drug, and the dosage in a separate database known as SMS. Each night, a patient-specific medicine administration schedule (MAS) displaying the data entered into the SMS system is printed out and filed in the patient's chart. The purpose of this double-entry regime is to enhance the Hospital's ability to track and correlate requests for and administration of medications in the ICU.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June of 2002 a nursing supervisor approached Dufault about a possible discrepancy in the dual entries for a patient in her care. The supervisor accepted Dufault's on-the-spot explanation and allowed the incident to pass without further inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following month, the same supervisor detected what appeared to be inconsistencies between the Omnicell record and the MAS of one of Dufault's patients. The supervisor conducted an independent review of Dufault's entries into the Omnicell and SMS systems. Based on that review, the supervisor and a nurse who had assisted her concluded that, on a number of occasions, Dufault had withdrawn medication from the Omnicell without recording an offsetting entry for administration in the SMS system. They related their conclusions to the director of nursing, Mary Brown, who placed Dufault on administrative leave pending further investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 27, 2002, Brown met with Dufault, an MNA representative, and the two nurses who had conducted the initial review. Brown presented Dufault with the Omnicell and SMS printouts for five different patients and asked her to explain the inconsistences in her entries. With respect to an instance in which she had withdrawn eighteen milligrams of Ativan but had made no record of dispensing such a dose to the patient, Dufault stated that she had retrieved the unusually large quantity of Ativan so that she could prepare an intravenous drip bag and avoid having to return periodically to the Omnicell to obtain the smaller doses prescribed in the physician's orders. The other four instances dated back nearly two months, and Dufault complained that, without forewarning, she could not recall the particulars. She speculated, however, that incomplete documentation by her and an orientee probably explained the discrepancies. The meeting ended on that note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown convened a second meeting two days later. She regarded Dufault's explanation of the discrepancy involving the eighteen milligrams of Ativan as implausible; the patient's intravenous drip had been discontinued several hours before Dufault withdrew the Ativan, and the physician's orders called for the drug to be injected rather than administered by intravenous drip. Dufault stood by her previous account. Brown then presented Dufault with two more alleged inconsistencies in her entries and served her with a termination notice. The stated reason for termination was: \"Failure to adhere to the standards of narcotic/controlled substance administration-suspected drug diversion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Dufault's discharge, the MNA filed a grievance on her behalf. The parties eventually submitted two imbricated matters to binding arbitration: (i) whether there was just cause for Dufault's termination and (ii) if not, what consequences should ensue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitrator conducted an evidentiary hearing. She subsequently issued an opinion concluding that the preponderance of the evidence did not support the claim that Dufault had engaged in drug diversion but, rather, supported her repeated denials of culpability. In the arbitrator's view, Dufault's testimony that the discrepancies were most likely the result of documentation errors was worthy of belief for four reasons: (i) Dufault and other nurses testified credibly that they commonly caught up on their SMS entries during breaks or at the end of their shifts when they could not always remember the exact medications and dosages administered; (ii) Dufault's explanation of the probable cause of the discrepancies had remained consistent throughout the investigation and the grievance process; (iii) Dufault's testimony that ICU nurses occasionally deviated from established documentation protocols had \"been more corroborated than rebutted\" by the other evidence in the case; and (iv) there was absolutely no proof to substantiate the Hospital's accusation that the discrepancies in the records were attributable to the diversion of drugs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The arbitrator also found that Dufault had received no formal training as a preceptor and that the Hospital had no established policy as to which nurse &#8212; the preceptor or the orientee &#8212; was responsible for documenting the medications administered to patients who were under their joint care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With specific reference to the Ativan incident, the arbitrator accepted the testimony of two non-party witnesses that it was common practice for ICU nurses to prepare intravenous drip bags well in advance of the time when they would be needed (either for use during their own or succeeding shifts). The arbitrator also credited testimony that although it was not good practice, a nurse might deviate from a doctor's orders and administer medication intravenously rather than by syringe as a time-saving device.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of these findings, the arbitrator concluded in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital failed to carry its burden ... in this matter. The preponderance of the evidence in the record supports [Dufault's] denial of any culpability with respect to the Hospital's charges of drug diversion.... [Dufault] credibly testified as to what she believed were the most likely actions she took (or did not take) with respect to the narcotics she removed from the Omnicell.... In light of the Hospital's failure to submit a preponderance of evidence that contradicts [Dufault's] account,... the termination ... is found to be without just cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitrator then moved to the remedy question and, taking into account the idiosyncratic facts of the case, ordered the Hospital to reinstate Dufault with back pay and without any loss of seniority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital was not pleased. It asked the federal district court to vacate the award on the ground that reinstating Dufault would violate public policy. The MNA cross-filed for confirmation of the award. The district judge referred the case to a magistrate judge, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(b)(1)(B), who recommended confirmation. On de novo review, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b), the district judge adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation and entered judgment for the MNA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, the employer and the union have bargained for an arbitrator's construction of a CBA, a court's authority to vacate an arbitral award is closely circumscribed. <i>Boston Med. Ctr. v. SEIU, Local 285,</i> 260 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Teamsters Local Union No. 42 v. Supervalu, Inc.,</i> 212 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir.2000). Thus, a party who challenges an arbitrator's award in the labor-management context must be prepared to undertake a steep uphill climb. Typically, the challenge will fail if the award \"draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement\" rather than from the arbitrator's \"own brand of industrial justice.\" <i>USW v. Enter. Wheel &amp; Car Corp.,</i> 363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960). \"[A]s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract,\" the fact that he or she may have made a mistake &#8212; even a serious mistake &#8212; will not afford a basis for defenestrating the award. <i>United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc.,</i> 484 U.S. 29, 38, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987). That remains true whether the mistake concerns a matter of fact or a matter of law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are, however, a few exceptions to the general rule that the arbitrator has the last word. <i>See</i> 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a) (codifying certain exceptions); <i>Supervalu,</i> 212 F.3d at 66 (discussing other exceptions). One such exception, which traces its roots to the common law doctrine that courts may refuse to enforce illegal contracts, holds that a court may vacate an arbitral award that violates public policy. <i>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Local Union 759, Int'l Union of United Rubber Workers,</i> 461 U.S. 757, 766, 103 S.Ct. 2177, 76 L.Ed.2d 298 (1983). This exception is narrow. The mere fact that \"general considerations of supposed public interests\" might be offended by an arbitral award is not enough to make the exception available. <i>Id.</i> (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, the award must violate an \"explicit ... well defined and dominant\" public policy, as ascertained \"by reference to ... laws and legal precedents.\" <i>Id.</i> (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the context of an arbitration award that reinstates a fired employee, the question is not whether the charged conduct offends public policy or whether some remedy short of unconditional reinstatement (say, a probationary period or a suspension without pay) might have been preferable. Rather, the sole question is whether the award itself &#8212; the order for reinstatement &#8212; gives offense. <i>See E. Assoc'd Coal Corp. v. UMW, Dist. 17,</i> 531 U.S. 57, 62-63, 121 S.Ct. 462, 148 L.Ed.2d 354 (2000). We turn, then, to that question and ask whether the order to reinstate Dufault as an ICU nurse contravenes some explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy as ascertained by reference to the positive law of Massachusetts (which, of course, includes applicable federal law). <i>See id.</i> This inquiry is not free-form. In determining whether Dufault's reinstatement contravenes Massachusetts's declared public policy, we cannot forget that the parties, through the collective bargaining process, chose arbitration as the preferred means of resolving workplace disputes. Accordingly, we must read the pertinent statutes and regulations \"in light of background labor law policy that favors determination of disciplinary questions through arbitration when chosen as a result of labor-management negotiation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 65, 121 S.Ct. 462.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital relies on federal and state statutes and a state regulatory scheme to undergird its claim that Massachusetts has an explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy in favor of restricting the distribution of controlled substances. <i>See generally</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 801-971; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C. It notes that these provisions collectively establish strict controls on the handling of controlled substances and evince a strong concern for preventing the unauthorized distribution of such substances by health-care professionals. Zeroing in on the facts of this case, the Hospital emphasizes that the state's regulations governing the licensure of nurses set out strict standards of conduct with respect to the administration of controlled substances. <i>See</i> 244 Mass.Code Regs. 9.03. Pertinently, those regulations require nurses to (i) comply with the Controlled Substances Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C; (ii) maintain the security of controlled substances; (iii) refrain from unlawfully obtaining or possessing controlled substances; (iv) administer drugs only as prescribed; and (v) document the handling, administration, and destruction of controlled substances. 244 Mass.Code Regs. 9.03(6)(a)(8), (35), (37), (38), (39).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Building on this elaborate foundation, the Hospital asserts that Dufault breached the regulations by diverting drugs away from patients, by failing properly to document the dispensation of medications, and by administering Ativan through a medium other than that prescribed in the physician's orders. Consequently, the Hospital says, the arbitrator's award offends public policy because it reinstates a serial regulatory violator to a highly sensitive position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal problem with this line of argument is that it ignores the arbitrator's resolution of disputed issues. With a few limited exceptions not relevant here, an inquiring court is bound by an arbitrator's findings of fact. <i>See El Dorado Tech. Servs., Inc. v. Union Gen. De Trabajadores,</i> 961 F.2d 317, 320 (1st Cir.1992). Once due deference is accorded to the arbitrator's factual findings here, the Hospital's argument withers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital suggests that the arbitrator glossed over Dufault's unauthorized diversion of drugs and that even accidental diversion is serious business. After stuffing this straw man, the Hospital proceeds to shred it, telling us that because Dufault improperly diverted drugs in contravention of the state regulatory scheme, reinstating her to a sensitive position violates public policy. This construct overlooks that the arbitrator, far from glossing over the discrepancies in the Omnicell and SMS records, explicitly found that the Hospital had failed to prove that Dufault diverted any drugs away from patients. Thus, even if the mandated reinstatement of a nurse found to have deliberately diverted drugs might violate an explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy &#8212; and we intimate no view as to whether such a policy has been established &#8212; the mandated reinstatement of a nurse who has been exonerated of all charges of intentional drug diversion, such as Dufault, plainly would not. <i>Cf. Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 44, 108 S.Ct. 364 (refusing to vacate a reinstatement order when the employer had failed to prove its allegations of employee misconduct).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital's attempts to tease a violation of public policy out of Dufault's documentation errors and her use of an unauthorized method of administering Ativan are equally unconvincing. It argues that failure properly to account for controlled substances, even if not deliberate, is nevertheless a grave matter. While we agree with that premise &#8212; Dufault's conduct seems to have violated the Massachusetts nursing regulations, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 244 Mass.Code Regs. 9.03(38)-(39) &#8212; we do not accept the Hospital's conclusion that this fact somehow undermines the reinstatement order. After all, this appeal tests only whether the reinstatement award, on the facts as found by the arbitrator, contravenes an explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy. <i>See E. Assoc'd Coal,</i> 531 U.S. at 62-63, 121 S.Ct. 462. Once the issue is framed in that manner, it becomes nose-on-the-face plain that the Hospital has failed to establish any barrier at all to Dufault's reinstatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the Hospital has not identified a single iteration of positive law that prohibits the reinstatement of a nurse who, without causing injury to patients, made a few documentation errors or deviated slightly from doctors' orders on a single occasion in a long and distinguished career. This failure strongly suggests that the reinstatement order does not violate public policy. <i>See id.</i> at 66, 121 S.Ct. 462 (relying heavily on the fact that the reinstatement order did not violate a \"specific provision of any law or regulation\" in concluding that the order did not run contrary to public policy); <i>Boston Med. Ctr.,</i> 260 F.3d at 25 (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, there is reason to believe that an employer is not invariably required to point to a specific provision of positive law in order to bring a case within the ambit of the public policy exception. <i>See E. Assoc'd Coal,</i> 531 U.S. at 63, 121 S.Ct. 462 (dictum). <i>But cf. id.</i> at 67-69, 121 S.Ct. 462 (Scalia, J., concurring) (questioning this view). In a prior case in which a reinstatement order did not breach a specific provision of positive law, we required the employer to show that the reinstatement order subsumed employee conduct so egregious that resumed employment would offend some deep-rooted public policy. <i>See Boston Med. Ctr.,</i> 260 F.3d at 25. That precedent does not advance the Hospital's cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In endeavoring to make the showing that <i>Boston Medical Center</i> requires, an employer cannot relitigate the facts as found by the arbitrator. <i>See Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 44-45, 108 S.Ct. 364. In this case, based largely on the testimony of the Hospital's own witnesses, the arbitrator found that Dufault was a competent, hard-working nurse who had exceeded her employer's standards for many years; that neither Dufault's documentation bevues nor the single instance of her improper administration of Ativan had caused any harm to patients; that her explanation for the discrepancies in the records was credible; and that, in all events, there was no evidence of missing medication, let alone drug diversion. The arbitrator did not find that Dufault posed a risk of harm to patients, that she was incapable of properly documenting the administration of medication, or that she had displayed a pattern of failing to comply with doctors' orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are constrained to credit the various parts of this factual assessment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>El Dorado Tech. Servs.,</i> 961 F.2d at 320. Doing so, we find no principled basis for concluding that Dufault's underlying conduct was such as to render her reinstatement offensive to public policy. <i>See MidMich. Reg'l Med. Ctr. &#8212; Clare v. Prof'l Employees Div. of Local 79, SEIU,</i> 183 F.3d 497, 504 (6th Cir.1999) (\"Even highly skilled professionals err on occasion, and we think it clear that it cannot violate ... public policy ... to contract to retain a nurse guilty of committing some acts of carelessness.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing for the opposite result, the Hospital relies on a trio of decisions that vacated reinstatement awards under the public policy exception. <i>See Russell Mem'l Hosp. Ass'n v. USW,</i> 720 F.Supp. 583 (E.D.Mich.1989); <i>City of Boston v. Boston Police Patrolmen's Ass'n,</i> 443 Mass. 813, 824 N.E.2d 855 (2005); <i>Ill. Nurses Ass'n v. Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ill.,</i> 318 Ill.App.3d 519, 251 Ill.Dec. 836, 741 N.E.2d 1014 (2001). A court must be wary of reliance on precedents which, like these three decisions, involve state policies different than the one at issue. <i>See Boston Med. Ctr.,</i> 260 F.3d at 25 n. 7 (disregarding the plaintiff's citation of \"conclusions of other courts that the public policies of other states forbid the reinstatement of an employee\" in factually dissimilar cases). At any rate, the cases cited by the Hospital are readily distinguishable. In each of them, the affected employee committed acts far more blameworthy than those that the arbitrator attributed to Dufault. <i>See Russell Mem'l Hosp.,</i> 720 F.Supp. at 587 (involving a nurse who was guilty of negligence and insubordination and who had \"a propensity for misconduct\"); <i>Boston Police,</i> 824 N.E.2d at 859 (involving a police officer who had intentionally filed false charges and then committed perjury); <i>Ill. Nurses,</i> 251 Ill.Dec. 836, 741 N.E.2d at 1023-24 (involving an \"inattentive ... [and] ... below average\" nurse who had endangered the lives of two patients, intentionally falsified a patient's chart, and provided negligent care).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A much more instructive case is <i>Boston Medical Center,</i> in which an arbitrator ordered the reinstatement of a nurse whose slipshod care had resulted in a patient's death. 260 F.3d at 18-20. Relying on the nurse's unblemished ten-year work record and the arbitrator's finding that she had not \"willfully or callously provided substandard care,\" we concluded that the reinstatement order did not transgress Massachusetts's public policy. <i>Id.</i> at 25. The facts in the instant case are considerably more favorable to the employee than the facts in <i>Boston Medical Center</i>; after all, the arbitrator determined not only that Dufault had achieved an exemplary twenty-five-year nursing career but also that her relatively minor miscues had not threatened the welfare of any patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our refusal to vacate the reinstatement order in <i>Boston Medical Center</i> adumbrates the result we must reach here: upholding the district court's confirmation of the arbitrator's reinstatement order. While a single documentation or dispensing error may contravene the state's nursing regulations, not every such error or set of errors necessarily furnishes just cause for termination of a nurse's employment. Context is important. Here, the nature of the errors, the employee's history, the lack of any harm to patients, and the other circumstances as found by the arbitrator persuade us that reinstatement is not an affront to public policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. In this matter, the arbitrator supportably found that the Hospital had cashiered Dufault without just cause and ordered her reinstatement. The Hospital's attempt to upset that award is unavailing: although an employer may secure vacation of an arbitrator's reinstatement order in the rare case in which the employer can show that the order itself transgresses an explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy, the Hospital has wholly failed to bring this case within the isthmian confines of that doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We understand and appreciate the Hospital's concern with accountability for dangerous drugs. Each case, however, must be judged on its own facts. Here, the arbitrator appears to have weighed that concern in the balance. Given the idiosyncratic facts of the case, we are not at liberty to disturb her decision. What may transpire in different circumstances or if Dufault proves to be a repeat offender is, of course, an open question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In this vein, the arbitrator noted that Dufault had submitted to three drug tests, each of which had proved negative for the presence of Ativan, morphine, or any other controlled substance</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> For simplicity's sake, we do not distinguish hereafter between the magistrate judge and the district judge but, rather, take an institutional view and refer to the determinations below as those of the district court<i>See, e.g., United States v. Maldonado,</i> 356 F.3d 130, 134 n. 1 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note, in passing, that this assessment does not seem to be chimerical. During the pendency of this appeal, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Nursing dismissed the Hospital's complaint against Dufault for insufficient evidence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> At oral argument in this court, the Hospital suggested for the first time that the arbitrator erred in not imposing some lesser penalty once she found discharge unwarranted. This argument was not made in the district court and is, therefore, not properly before us<i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990). In all events, the sole question raised by this appeal is whether the reinstatement order offends public policy. That does not encompass the question of whether the imposition of some remedy short of unconditional reinstatement might have been desirable.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The hospital, citing the pains that must be taken by health-care professionals to restrict the distribution of controlled substances, appeals on the ground that the reinstatement order transgresses public policy. After studying the matter, we agree with the district court that the arbitral award should be confirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by rehearsing the underlying facts. We then limn what transpired before the arbitrator and the district court, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellant Mercy Hospital (the Hospital) operates an acute care hospital facility in Springfield, Massachusetts. Defendant-appellee Massachusetts Nurses Association (the MNA) is the authorized collective bargaining representative of the nurses who toil there. The Hospital and the MNA are (and were at all relevant times) parties to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The CBA recognizes the Hospital's right to \"discipline or discharge employees for just cause\" and establishes a multi-step grievance procedure, culminating in binding arbitration, for the resolution of employment-related disputes between the Hospital and the nurses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital hired Nancy Dufault as a nurse in 1977. In the pertinent time frame (2001-2002), Dufault worked the twelve-hour night shift in the intensive care unit (ICU). Part of her responsibilities included administration of Ativan, morphine, and other controlled substances designed to relieve pain or anxiety. Dufault also served as a preceptor charged with ground-level oversight of fledgling ICU nurses (orientees).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over her estimable quarter-century career, Dufault developed a reputation as an industrious, highly skilled nurse. In 1995, the Hospital gave her a special commendation for her service as a preceptor. Her last performance evaluation, prepared shortly before the events in question occurred, describes her as \"a very strong expert critical care nurse\" and remarks that she had exceeded hospital standards in a number of performance areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 2001, storm clouds gathered. The Hospital revised its system for administering medication to ICU patients and installed an Omnicell machine in that unit. The machine functions as a computerized medicine cabinet. To obtain medication, a nurse must enter into an electronic keypad her personal code, the patient's personal code, the type of drug, and the dosage. The Omnicell processes this information and automatically unlocks the compartment housing the requested medication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After administering the medicine to the patient, the nurse records the time, the identity of the drug, and the dosage in a separate database known as SMS. Each night, a patient-specific medicine administration schedule (MAS) displaying the data entered into the SMS system is printed out and filed in the patient's chart. The purpose of this double-entry regime is to enhance the Hospital's ability to track and correlate requests for and administration of medications in the ICU.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June of 2002 a nursing supervisor approached Dufault about a possible discrepancy in the dual entries for a patient in her care. The supervisor accepted Dufault's on-the-spot explanation and allowed the incident to pass without further inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following month, the same supervisor detected what appeared to be inconsistencies between the Omnicell record and the MAS of one of Dufault's patients. The supervisor conducted an independent review of Dufault's entries into the Omnicell and SMS systems. Based on that review, the supervisor and a nurse who had assisted her concluded that, on a number of occasions, Dufault had withdrawn medication from the Omnicell without recording an offsetting entry for administration in the SMS system. They related their conclusions to the director of nursing, Mary Brown, who placed Dufault on administrative leave pending further investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 27, 2002, Brown met with Dufault, an MNA representative, and the two nurses who had conducted the initial review. Brown presented Dufault with the Omnicell and SMS printouts for five different patients and asked her to explain the inconsistences in her entries. With respect to an instance in which she had withdrawn eighteen milligrams of Ativan but had made no record of dispensing such a dose to the patient, Dufault stated that she had retrieved the unusually large quantity of Ativan so that she could prepare an intravenous drip bag and avoid having to return periodically to the Omnicell to obtain the smaller doses prescribed in the physician's orders. The other four instances dated back nearly two months, and Dufault complained that, without forewarning, she could not recall the particulars. She speculated, however, that incomplete documentation by her and an orientee probably explained the discrepancies. The meeting ended on that note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown convened a second meeting two days later. She regarded Dufault's explanation of the discrepancy involving the eighteen milligrams of Ativan as implausible; the patient's intravenous drip had been discontinued several hours before Dufault withdrew the Ativan, and the physician's orders called for the drug to be injected rather than administered by intravenous drip. Dufault stood by her previous account. Brown then presented Dufault with two more alleged inconsistencies in her entries and served her with a termination notice. The stated reason for termination was: \"Failure to adhere to the standards of narcotic/controlled substance administration-suspected drug diversion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Dufault's discharge, the MNA filed a grievance on her behalf. The parties eventually submitted two imbricated matters to binding arbitration: (i) whether there was just cause for Dufault's termination and (ii) if not, what consequences should ensue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitrator conducted an evidentiary hearing. She subsequently issued an opinion concluding that the preponderance of the evidence did not support the claim that Dufault had engaged in drug diversion but, rather, supported her repeated denials of culpability. In the arbitrator's view, Dufault's testimony that the discrepancies were most likely the result of documentation errors was worthy of belief for four reasons: (i) Dufault and other nurses testified credibly that they commonly caught up on their SMS entries during breaks or at the end of their shifts when they could not always remember the exact medications and dosages administered; (ii) Dufault's explanation of the probable cause of the discrepancies had remained consistent throughout the investigation and the grievance process; (iii) Dufault's testimony that ICU nurses occasionally deviated from established documentation protocols had \"been more corroborated than rebutted\" by the other evidence in the case; and (iv) there was absolutely no proof to substantiate the Hospital's accusation that the discrepancies in the records were attributable to the diversion of drugs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The arbitrator also found that Dufault had received no formal training as a preceptor and that the Hospital had no established policy as to which nurse &#8212; the preceptor or the orientee &#8212; was responsible for documenting the medications administered to patients who were under their joint care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With specific reference to the Ativan incident, the arbitrator accepted the testimony of two non-party witnesses that it was common practice for ICU nurses to prepare intravenous drip bags well in advance of the time when they would be needed (either for use during their own or succeeding shifts). The arbitrator also credited testimony that although it was not good practice, a nurse might deviate from a doctor's orders and administer medication intravenously rather than by syringe as a time-saving device.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of these findings, the arbitrator concluded in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital failed to carry its burden ... in this matter. The preponderance of the evidence in the record supports [Dufault's] denial of any culpability with respect to the Hospital's charges of drug diversion.... [Dufault] credibly testified as to what she believed were the most likely actions she took (or did not take) with respect to the narcotics she removed from the Omnicell.... In light of the Hospital's failure to submit a preponderance of evidence that contradicts [Dufault's] account,... the termination ... is found to be without just cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitrator then moved to the remedy question and, taking into account the idiosyncratic facts of the case, ordered the Hospital to reinstate Dufault with back pay and without any loss of seniority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital was not pleased. It asked the federal district court to vacate the award on the ground that reinstating Dufault would violate public policy. The MNA cross-filed for confirmation of the award. The district judge referred the case to a magistrate judge, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(b)(1)(B), who recommended confirmation. On de novo review, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b), the district judge adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation and entered judgment for the MNA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, the employer and the union have bargained for an arbitrator's construction of a CBA, a court's authority to vacate an arbitral award is closely circumscribed. <i>Boston Med.

Thus, a party who challenges an arbitrator's award in the labor-management context must be prepared to undertake a steep uphill climb. Typically, the challenge will fail if the award \"draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement\" rather than from the arbitrator's \"own brand of industrial justice.\" <i>USW v. Enter.

One such exception, which traces its roots to the common law doctrine that courts may refuse to enforce illegal contracts, holds that a court may vacate an arbitral award that violates public policy. <i>W.R.

The mere fact that \"general considerations of supposed public interests\" might be offended by an arbitral award is not enough to make the exception available. <i>Id.</i> (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

Rather, the sole question is whether the award itself &#8212; the order for reinstatement &#8212; gives offense. <i>See E. Assoc'd Coal Corp. v. UMW, Dist. 17,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118392\"><a href=\"/opinion/118392/eastern-associated-coal-corp-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 62-63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118392\"><a href=\"/opinion/118392/eastern-associated-coal-corp-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We turn, then, to that question and ask whether the order to reinstate Dufault as an ICU nurse contravenes some explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy as ascertained by reference to the positive law of Massachusetts (which, of course, includes applicable federal law). <i>See id.</i> This inquiry is not free-form. In determining whether Dufault's reinstatement contravenes Massachusetts's declared public policy, we cannot forget that the parties, through the collective bargaining process, chose arbitration as the preferred means of resolving workplace disputes. Accordingly, we must read the pertinent statutes and regulations \"in light of background labor law policy that favors determination of disciplinary questions through arbitration when chosen as a result of labor-management negotiation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 65, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118392\"><a href=\"/opinion/118392/eastern-associated-coal-corp-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Gen. Laws ch. 94C. It notes that these provisions collectively establish strict controls on the handling of controlled substances and evince a strong concern for preventing the unauthorized distribution of such substances by health-care professionals. Zeroing in on the facts of this case, the Hospital emphasizes that the state's regulations governing the licensure of nurses set out strict standards of conduct with respect to the administration of controlled substances. <i>See</i> 244 Mass.Code Regs. 9.03. Pertinently, those regulations require nurses to (i) comply with the Controlled Substances Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C; (ii) maintain the security of controlled substances; (iii) refrain from unlawfully obtaining or possessing controlled substances; (iv) administer drugs only as prescribed; and (v) document the handling, administration, and destruction of controlled substances. 244 Mass.Code Regs. 9.03(6)(a)(8), (35), (37), (38), (39).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Building on this elaborate foundation, the Hospital asserts that Dufault breached the regulations by diverting drugs away from patients, by failing properly to document the dispensation of medications, and by administering Ativan through a medium other than that prescribed in the physician's orders. Consequently, the Hospital says, the arbitrator's award offends public policy because it reinstates a serial regulatory violator to a highly sensitive position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal problem with this line of argument is that it ignores the arbitrator's resolution of disputed issues. With a few limited exceptions not relevant here, an inquiring court is bound by an arbitrator's findings of fact. <i>See El Dorado Tech. Servs., Inc. v. Union Gen. De Trabajadores,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581363\"><a href=\"/opinion/581363/el-dorado-technical-services-inc-v-union-general-de-trabajadores-de/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 320 (1st Cir.1992). Once due deference is accorded to the arbitrator's factual findings here, the Hospital's argument withers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital suggests that the arbitrator glossed over Dufault's unauthorized diversion of drugs and that even accidental diversion is serious business. After stuffing this straw man, the Hospital proceeds to shred it, telling us that because Dufault improperly diverted drugs in contravention of the state regulatory scheme, reinstating her to a sensitive position violates public policy. This construct overlooks that the arbitrator, far from glossing over the discrepancies in the Omnicell and SMS records, explicitly found that the Hospital had failed to prove that Dufault diverted any drugs away from patients. Thus, even if the mandated reinstatement of a nurse found to have deliberately diverted drugs might violate an explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy &#8212; and we intimate no view as to whether such a policy has been established &#8212; the mandated reinstatement of a nurse who has been exonerated of all charges of intentional drug diversion, such as Dufault, plainly would not. <i>Cf. Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111965\"><a href=\"/opinion/111965/paperworkers-v-misco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span> (refusing to vacate a reinstatement order when the employer had failed to prove its allegations of employee misconduct).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital's attempts to tease a violation of public policy out of Dufault's documentation errors and her use of an unauthorized method of administering Ativan are equally unconvincing. It argues that failure properly to account for controlled substances, even if not deliberate, is nevertheless a grave matter. While we agree with that premise &#8212; Dufault's conduct seems to have violated the Massachusetts nursing regulations, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 244 Mass.Code Regs. 9.03(38)-(39) &#8212; we do not accept the Hospital's conclusion that this fact somehow undermines the reinstatement order. After all, this appeal tests only whether the reinstatement award, on the facts as found by the arbitrator, contravenes an explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy. <i>See E. Assoc'd Coal,</i> 531 U.S. at 62-63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118392\"><a href=\"/opinion/118392/eastern-associated-coal-corp-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>. Once the issue is framed in that manner, it becomes nose-on-the-face plain that the Hospital has failed to establish any barrier at all to Dufault's reinstatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the Hospital has not identified a single iteration of positive law that prohibits the reinstatement of a nurse who, without causing injury to patients, made a few documentation errors or deviated slightly from doctors' orders on a single occasion in a long and distinguished career. This failure strongly suggests that the reinstatement order does not violate public policy. <i>See id.</i> at 66, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118392\"><a href=\"/opinion/118392/eastern-associated-coal-corp-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span> (relying heavily on the fact that the reinstatement order did not violate a \"specific provision of any law or regulation\" in concluding that the order did not run contrary to public policy); <i>Boston Med.

Assoc'd Coal,</i> 531 U.S. at 63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118392\"><a href=\"/opinion/118392/eastern-associated-coal-corp-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span> (Scalia, J., concurring) (questioning this view). In a prior case in which a reinstatement order did not breach a specific provision of positive law, we required the employer to show that the reinstatement order subsumed employee conduct so egregious that resumed employment would offend some deep-rooted public policy. <i>See Boston Med. Ctr.,</i> 260 F.3d at 25. That precedent does not advance the Hospital's cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In endeavoring to make the showing that <i>Boston Medical Center</i> requires, an employer cannot relitigate the facts as found by the arbitrator. <i>See Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 44-45, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111965\"><a href=\"/opinion/111965/paperworkers-v-misco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>. In this case, based largely on the testimony of the Hospital's own witnesses, the arbitrator found that Dufault was a competent, hard-working nurse who had exceeded her employer's standards for many years; that neither Dufault's documentation bevues nor the single instance of her improper administration of Ativan had caused any harm to patients; that her explanation for the discrepancies in the records was credible; and that, in all events, there was no evidence of missing medication, let alone drug diversion. The arbitrator did not find that Dufault posed a risk of harm to patients, that she was incapable of properly documenting the administration of medication, or that she had displayed a pattern of failing to comply with doctors' orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are constrained to credit the various parts of this factual assessment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>El Dorado Tech. Servs.,</i> 961 F.2d at 320. Doing so, we find no principled basis for concluding that Dufault's underlying conduct was such as to render her reinstatement offensive to public policy. <i>See MidMich.

Nurses Ass'n v. Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ill.,</i> 318 Ill.App.3d 519, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2034324\"><a href=\"/opinion/2034324/ill-nurses-assoc-v-bd-of-trustees-of-univ/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

A court must be wary of reliance on precedents which, like these three decisions, involve state policies different than the one at issue. <i>See Boston Med. Ctr.,</i> 260 F.3d at 25 n. 7 (disregarding the plaintiff's citation of \"conclusions of other courts that the public policies of other states forbid the reinstatement of an employee\" in factually dissimilar cases). At any rate, the cases cited by the Hospital are readily distinguishable. In each of them, the affected employee committed acts far more blameworthy than those that the arbitrator attributed to Dufault. <i>See Russell Mem'l Hosp.,</i> 720 F.Supp. at 587 (involving a nurse who was guilty of negligence and insubordination and who had \"a propensity for misconduct\"); <i>Boston Police,</i> 824 N.E.2d at 859 (involving a police officer who had intentionally filed false charges and then committed perjury); <i>Ill.

Relying on the nurse's unblemished ten-year work record and the arbitrator's finding that she had not \"willfully or callously provided substandard care,\" we concluded that the reinstatement order did not transgress Massachusetts's public policy. <i>Id.</i> at 25. The facts in the instant case are considerably more favorable to the employee than the facts in <i>Boston Medical Center</i>; after all, the arbitrator determined not only that Dufault had achieved an exemplary twenty-five-year nursing career but also that her relatively minor miscues had not threatened the welfare of any patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our refusal to vacate the reinstatement order in <i>Boston Medical Center</i> adumbrates the result we must reach here: upholding the district court's confirmation of the arbitrator's reinstatement order. While a single documentation or dispensing error may contravene the state's nursing regulations, not every such error or set of errors necessarily furnishes just cause for termination of a nurse's employment. Context is important. Here, the nature of the errors, the employee's history, the lack of any harm to patients, and the other circumstances as found by the arbitrator persuade us that reinstatement is not an affront to public policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. In this matter, the arbitrator supportably found that the Hospital had cashiered Dufault without just cause and ordered her reinstatement. The Hospital's attempt to upset that award is unavailing: although an employer may secure vacation of an arbitrator's reinstatement order in the rare case in which the employer can show that the order itself transgresses an explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy, the Hospital has wholly failed to bring this case within the isthmian confines of that doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We understand and appreciate the Hospital's concern with accountability for dangerous drugs. Each case, however, must be judged on its own facts. Here, the arbitrator appears to have weighed that concern in the balance. Given the idiosyncratic facts of the case, we are not at liberty to disturb her decision. What may transpire in different circumstances or if Dufault proves to be a repeat offender is, of course, an open question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In this vein, the arbitrator noted that Dufault had submitted to three drug tests, each of which had proved negative for the presence of Ativan, morphine, or any other controlled substance</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> For simplicity's sake, we do not distinguish hereafter between the magistrate judge and the district judge but, rather, take an institutional view and refer to the determinations below as those of the district court<i>See, e.g., United States v. Maldonado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200818\"><a href=\"/opinion/200818/united-states-v-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, 134 n. 1 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note, in passing, that this assessment does not seem to be chimerical. During the pendency of this appeal, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Nursing dismissed the Hospital's complaint against Dufault for insufficient evidence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> At oral argument in this court, the Hospital suggested for the first time that the arbitrator erred in not imposing some lesser penalty once she found discharge unwarranted. This argument was not made in the district court and is, therefore, not properly before us<i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990). In all events, the sole question raised by this appeal is whether the reinstatement order offends public policy. That does not encompass the question of whether the imposition of some remedy short of unconditional reinstatement might have been desirable.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
