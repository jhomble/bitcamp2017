On  July  2,  1992,  a  jury\n                            \n\nconvicted   Rafael  Angel  Zavala   Maldonado  (\"Zavala\")  of\n\npossession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1).1   On appeal,  Zavala argues  that\n\nthe evidence  was insufficient to support  the conviction and\n\nthat  defense  counsel's   closing  argument  was  improperly\n\nhampered by objections  from the prosecutor.  For the reasons\n\nset forth, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     The first ground of  appeal requires an understanding of\n\nthe  evidence  and,  given  the  conviction,  we  recite  the\n\nevidence  in  the light  most  favorable  to the  government.\n\nUnited States v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 522-23 (1st Cir. 1991).\n                      \n\nIn January  1992, Ruben  de los  Santos (\"Santos\"),  a seaman\n\nserving on board  the M/V Euro  Colombia, was in the  port of\n\nCartagena,  Colombia.    There,  a drug  dealer  gave  Santos\n\nsixteen  packages of cocaine,  amounting to a  total of eight\n\nkilograms,  and asked  Santos to  deliver them  as instructed\n\nwhen the ship docked at the port of Ponce, Puerto Rico.  \n\n     Santos  had  earlier  been approached  by  American  law\n\nenforcement agents  attached to  the Customs Service,  and he\n\naccepted the cocaine  in Cartagena with  the approval of  the\n\n                    \n\n     1The  jury  acquitted  Zavala  of  two  other  charges--\nimporting cocaine into  the United States,  21 U.S.C.    952,\nand using a telephone to commit or facilitate  the possession\noffense,  21 U.S.C.     843(b)--and these  counts require  no\nfurther discussion.\n\n                             -2-\n\nagents, who intended to track the drugs to their destination.\n\nSantos  kept  the drugs  hidden  during  the  voyage and,  on\n\narriving  in Ponce,  conferred  immediately with  the agents.\n\nShortly  thereafter, Santos  under  surveillance  by  federal\n\nagents and cooperating local police,  went to the Hotel Melia\n\nin  Ponce  and asked  at the  front  desk for  Mr. Palestino.\n\nThese last two  steps complied with the instructions given to\n\nSantos  in  Catagena, by  the dealer  who  had given  him the\n\ncocaine,  to deliver it to  Palestino, at the  Hotel Melia in\n\nPonce.\n\n     When  the  clerk  called  from  the  desk  to  the  room\n\nregistered to  Palestino, the  defendant Zavala appeared  and\n\ngestured to  Santos to follow him to room 302.  There Santos,\n\nwho was  carrying the cocaine in  a bag, told Zavala  that he\n\nhad the drugs to be delivered to Palestino.  Zavala said that\n\nhe was a friend of Palestino and that Palestino would come to\n\nthe  hotel.  Using a cellular telephone, Zavala then placed a\n\ncall,  purportedly  to Palestino.    Then  at Santos'  urging\n\nZavala called a second time to ask Palestino to come quickly.\n\nZavala  asked Santos if they could put the cocaine in another\n\nhotel  room, saying that he (Zavala) had other friends in the\n\nhotel, but Santos refused.\n\n     As  time  passed and  Palestino  still  did not  arrive,\n\nSantos became increasingly anxious  and he proposed to Zavala\n\nthat  they go  out of the  room for  a soda.   Zavala agreed,\n\n                             -3-\n\nSantos  placed  the  bag with  the  cocaine  in  a closet  or\n\ndressing room  in room 302, and the two men left room 302 and\n\nentered  the corridor.   As  they went  down the  stairs, the\n\nsupervising   customs  agent  detained  them.    When  Santos\n\nexplained that  Palestino had  still not arrived,  Zavala was\n\ntaken  back to room 302 in custody, accompanied by Santos and\n\none  or more agents.   There were  several more calls  to the\n\nroom purportedly from Palestino, two or three on the cellular\n\ntelephone and one on the hotel telephone; in each case Santos\n\ntold the caller that Zavala was out or otherwise occupied.\n\n     Shortly after the  final call, the operation came  to an\n\nend.  Law  enforcement agents,  it appears, had  seen a  car,\n\nwith the  driver using a cellular  telephone, circling around\n\nthe hotel.   The driver then parked and went  into the hotel.\n\nHe  proceeded with  another  individual to  one of  the hotel\n\nrooms and entered.  When agents  then knocked on the door  of\n\nthis room,  the individuals  inside exited through  a window.\n\nAfter  a chase they  were caught, and  a search of  their car\n\nyielded a loaded nine millimeter pistol and $6,305 in cash.\n\n     This  final episode  was described  in testimony  at the\n\ntrial.  So  far as we know, neither the  driver nor the other\n\nman with him was  charged.  Possibly the police  thought that\n\nthe  evidence was  not  quite strong  enough  to prove  their\n\nparticipation in the drug deal.  Zavala, however, was charged\n\n                             -4-\n\nas  previously  described,   and  convicted  on  one   count:\n\npossession with intent to distribute.\n\n                             II.\n\n     Zavala's primary claim is  that an acquittal should have\n\nbeen  ordered on  grounds of  insufficient evidence  to prove\n\npossession.   We begin by  noting that on  this record Zavala\n\nwas  surely  guilty  of a  closely-related  offense,  namely,\n\nconspiracy to  possess drugs with intent  to distribute them.\n\n21  U.S.C.     841,  846.    An  agreement  with  the  absent\n\nPalestino is  readily inferred from  Zavala's statements  and\n\nthe  telephone  calls,  and  the object  of  the  agreement--\n\ntransferring a dealer-sized quantity of cocaine to Palestino-\n\n-is no  less apparent.    A slightly  more inventive  offense\n\nwould be a charge of  aiding and abetting Palestino's attempt\n                                                             \n\nto possess with intent to distribute, under  18 U.S.C.     2,\n\n841.  See, e.g., United States v. Kottmyer, 961 F.2d 569 (6th\n                                          \n\nCir. 1992).\n\n     But  Zavala was  not  charged with  conspiracy, or  with\n\naiding and abetting an attempt, nor did a jury convict him of\n\nsuch  crimes.  The  formalities of indictment  and jury trial\n\nare prescribed by the Constitution.   U.S. Const., Amends. V,\n\nVI.   Further, given that these offenses were not charged, it\n\nis  hardly  sufficient  to  say that  this  record  contained\n                                          \n\nevidence to  support such a  conviction for such  an offense.\n\nWe do not know what evidence  the record might contain if the\n\n                             -5-\n\ndefendant  had been given notice  that he was  charged with a\n\nquite different  offense (say, conspiracy) instead  of, or in\n\naddition to, the offense charged (here, possession).  \n\n     Thus the  conviction for possession can stand  only if a\n\nreasonable  jury  could  find  that Zavala  did  possess  the\n\ncocaine  within  the meaning  of  21 U.S.C.    841.    If the\n\nstatute  used  the  term  \"possess\"  as  a  lay  juror  might\n\nunderstand it prior to instructions from the  judge, it might\n\nbe  a stretch to say  that Zavala \"possessed\"  the cocaine in\n\nthe  bag.  There is no evidence  that he even touched the bag\n\nor saw the cocaine or that he was ever alone in the room with\n\nit  or that he had a  practical opportunity to remove it from\n\nthe hotel.  These facts explain why Zavala's main argument on\n\nappeal  is that  his relationship  to the  cocaine cannot  be\n\ndeemed \"possession.\"\n\n     The difficulty with  the argument is that the concept of\n\npossession in the drug statute comes freighted with a history\n\nof  interpretation.   Congress  was here  concerned not  with\n\n\"possession\" in  a narrowly  focused situation (e.g.,  actual\n                                                    \n\npossession of a weapon on an aircraft) but with possession of\n\ndrugs incident to their distribution.   There is every reason\n\nto think that Congress wished to cast its net widely so that,\n\nassuming  mens rea, a  defendant proximately  associated with\n                  \n\nthe  drugs would be reached  by the statute.   The prevailing\n\n                             -6-\n\ninterpretation of \"possession,\" in  the framework of the drug\n\nstatutes, reflects that broad reach.  \n\n     Under settled law, \"possession\" includes not merely  the\n\nstate of  immediate, hands-on  physical  possession but  also\n\n\"constructive\"   possession,  including   possession  through\n\nanother, and joint as well as exclusive possession.   Further\n\nthese  concepts can be combined  so that, for example, \"joint\n\nconstructive possession\" is quite as bad as  having the drugs\n\nexclusively in  one's own  pocket.   E.g.,  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nBatista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14,  18-19 (1st Cir. 1991).   These\n               \n\nconcepts  of  constructive and  joint  possession are  almost\n\nuniformly  reflected  in  both  decisions2  and  in  standard\n\ninstructions.3 \n\n     \"Constructive\" possession  is  commonly defined  as  the\n\npower  and intention  to  exercise control,  or dominion  and\n\ncontrol,  over an  object not  in one's  \"actual\" possession.\n\nE.g., United States v. Acevedo, supra, 842  F.2d at 507.  The\n                                     \n\n\"constructive possession\" label may confuse jurors at first--\n\ndrug trial juries  routinely ask  to be  reinstructed on  the\n\ndefinition   of  possession--but   the  underlying   idea  is\n\n                    \n\n     2See,  e.g., United  States v.  Akinola, 985  F.2d 1105,\n                                            \n1109  (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Vargas, 945 F.2d 426,\n                                              \n428  (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Acevedo, 842 F.2d 502,\n                                              \n507 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n     3E.  Devitt, C.  Blackmar, K.  O'Malley, 2  Federal Jury\n                                                             \nPractice and  Instructions, Criminal    54.08, at  906 (1990)\n                                    \n(collecting  cases); L.  Sand,  J. Siffert,  W. Loughlin,  S.\nReiss, 2 Modern Federal Jury Instructions 56-9 (1992) (same).\n                                         \n\n                             -7-\n\nimportant and not so  difficult to grasp.  Courts  are saying\n\nthat one  can possess an object while it is hidden at home in\n\na bureau drawer, or while held  by an agent, or even while it\n\nis  secured in  a safe  deposit box  at the  bank and  can be\n\nretrieved only when  a bank  official opens the  vault.   The\n\nproblem is not so much with the idea as with deciding how far\n\nit should be carried.\n\n     Here,  we think is at least arguable that Zavala was not\n                                                             \n\nshown  to possess the  drugs while he and  Santos were in the\n\nroom together.   Santos  apparently had exclusive  control of\n\nthe bag during this period.   It contained drugs for which he\n\nhad not been paid; Zavala was not the named person to whom it\n\nwas to  be delivered; and Santos  refused Zavala's suggestion\n\nthat  the bag  be entrusted  to Zavala's  friends in  another\n\nroom.  If  the agents had  broken into the room  and arrested\n\nZavala  at this point, a  directed verdict of acquittal might\n\nhave been required.\n\n     But once both parties departed from the room leaving the\n\ndrugs inside, the situation  altered.  It is not  that Zavala\n\ngot closer to  the drugs--indeed, he moved further  away from\n\nthem--but  rather  that   two  other  circumstances  changed:\n\nfirst, Santos surrendered his  actual possession of them; and\n\nsecond, with the acquiescence of both parties, the drugs were\n\nsecured in  Zavala's room.  In  the context of  this case, we\n\nthink  that  a  jury  could  then  find  both  requisites  of\n\n                             -8-\n\nconstructive possession:  that Zavala had sufficient power to\n\ncontrol the drugs and an intention to exercise that power.\n\n     Turning first to the power to exercise control, we begin\n                               \n\nwith the fact that the drugs were left in Zavala's  room with\n\nhis  knowledge  and consent  while  Zavala  was awaiting  the\n\narrival of  an accomplice  to pay  for them.   It is  fair to\n\ndescribe  the location as Zavala's  hotel room because he was\n\neffectively in occupation and the jury could reasonably infer\n\nthat he could return there at will.  The evidence showed that\n\nthe room,  although registered in Palestino's  name, had been\n\nlent to two occupants.  It was Zavala who emerged when Santos\n\narrived at  the hotel and  the room  was called;  and it  was\n\nZavala  who took  Santos to  the room  to await  \"his friend\"\n\nPalestino.  \n\n     The location of drugs or firearms in a  defendant's home\n\nor  car is a common  basis for attributing  possession to the\n\ndefendant.4  This  is so  even if  the residence  or room  is\n\nshared  by others.  E.g.,  United States v.  Garcia, 983 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1160,  1164  (1st Cir.  1993).   The  cases do  not  say that\n\npossession is automatic  but rather that the location  of the\n\nobject in a domain specially  accessible to the defendant can\n\n                    \n\n     4See, e.g., United States v. Wight,  986 F.2d 1393, 1398\n                                       \n(1st Cir.  1992); United States  v. Echeverri, 982  F.2d 675,\n                                             \n678 (1st Cir.  1993); United States v. Chapdelaine,  989 F.2d\n                                                  \n28, 34 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 696 (1994).\n                                    \n\n                             -9-\n\n(at least where knowledge is admitted  or inferred) be enough\n\nto permit the jury to find possession.\n\n     Admittedly, Zavala's  power to control in  this case was\n\ndiluted because Santos had  not yet been paid and  might well\n\nhave resisted any attempt by Zavala to return to the room and\n\ncarry away  the drugs.   But by the  same token a  jury could\n\ninfer that drugs  now stored in Zavala's hotel room, awaiting\n\ntransfer to Zavala's accomplice, were at least as much within\n\nZavala's power to control  as within Santos' power.   If each\n\nhad an effective veto over the other, it would still be joint\n\npossession.  Two drug  dealers with cocaine in the  back seat\n\nof  their car might both possess it even though neither would\n\nlet the  other out  of sight.   Cf. United  States v.  Wight,\n                                                            \n\nsupra, 968 F.2d at 1398 (weapon in car given to one defendant\n     \n\n\"possessed\" by the other where in reach of both).  \n\n     The  issue of  intention is  quite as  important  as the\n                             \n\nissue of  power.   Someone  might have  effective power  over\n\ndrugs  simply because  they were  located within  reach while\n\ntheir true owner was temporarily absent; but if such a person\n\nhad power over the drugs (say, as a  temporary visitor to the\n\nroom  in which  they were  located) but  had no  intention to\n\nexercise  that power, there might  still be no  crime.  Here,\n\nZavala's connection with  the drugs stored in  his hotel room\n\nwas not at all innocent:  the drugs were stored there for the\n\n                             -10-\n\npurpose (so far as Zavala knew  and intended) of facilitating\n\ntheir transfer to his accomplice, Palestino.\n\n     In  many cases,  intention  and knowledge  are  inferred\n\nsolely from the location of the drugs in an area to which the\n\ndefendant  has a priority of access.  Here, Zavala's state of\n\nmind is established by  independent evidence:  his statements\n\nthat  Palestino would be there  soon, his suggestion that the\n\ndrugs be stored temporarily  in another room, apparently with\n\nhis  confederates; and  by  the cellular  telephone calls  by\n\nZavala and to  him seemingly from  Palestino.  No  reasonable\n\njury could have had any doubt that Zavala was there to assist\n\nin the transmission of the drugs lodged in his room.\n\n     Assuming Zavala's guilty mind,  it might still be argued\n\nthat  his precise  intention was  to aid  in the  storage and\n\ntransfer of the  drugs but not  to \"control\" the  drugs.   We\n\nthink this is  too fine a distinction.  Defendant's intention\n\nto  have  the drugs  stored in  his  room, incident  to their\n\nintended transfer  to a confederate, seems to us an intention\n\nintimately  related to his power to control  the drugs.  If a\n\njury  finds this  to be  constructive  possession, we  do not\n\nthink that it has  stretched the concept too far  or betrayed\n\nthe intention of Congress.\n\n          Finally,  it  is  beside  the  point that  Zavala's\n\n\"possession\"  in the  hallway  was extremely  brief and  that\n\nZavala probably could not have escaped with the drugs because\n\n                             -11-\n\nof  the police surveillance.  That the police are present and\n\nready to  frustrate distribution does not  make possession of\n\ndrugs any less a crime, and a minute of possession is as much\n\nan offense  as a year of possession.   See Santiago v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates,  889 F.2d  371, 376  (1st Cir.  1989).   If Palestino\n      \n\nhimself had arrived  and Santos  had handed him  the bag,  he\n\nwould  be guilty of possession  even if the  police had burst\n\ninto the room  sixty seconds  later.  The  completion of  the\n\ncrime  does not  require that  the defendant have  a sporting\n\nchance. \n\n                             III.\n\n     We  turn to Zavala's other  main claim of  error on this\n\nappeal.    Zavala  contends  that  the  prosecutor  so  often\n\ninterrupted  the  defense  summation with  objections  as  to\n\nconstitute misconduct  and to  prevent the jury  from hearing\n\nthe  defense's  closing  argument.    We  have  reviewed  the\n\ncomplete  transcript  of  defense  counsel's   summation  and\n\nconclude that  misconduct did not  occur nor was  the defense\n\nsummation seriously impaired.\n\n     It is  quite true that the  prosecutor's objections were\n\nnumerous.  Zavala's brief claims that 20 objections were made\n\nin  an  argument  that  covered  37  transcript  pages.   The\n\ngovernment's brief may also miss the mark by arguing that the\n\nclaim  now made was waived because not argued to the district\n\ncourt:    defense  counsel  did  state,  after  a  number  of\n\n                             -12-\n\nobjections from the prosecutor,  \"I have an objection  to the\n\ncontinuous  interruptions.\"   This is  the same  argument now\n\nrenewed on appeal.\n\n     But if the objection was preserved, it was also  largely\n\nanswered by  the trial judge's rejoinder  to defense counsel:\n\n\"Well, then you behave better.  Stick to the facts before the\n\nCourt  and   before  the   jury  and   you  won't  have   any\n\ninterruptions.\"   The  fact is  that most  of the  objections\n\nruled on by the judge  were sustained on the ground that  the\n\ndefense  counsel  was  arguing  facts  outside  the   record,\n\nmisstating evidence, or misstating the law.  Unless the trial\n\njudge was  mistaken in  his rulings, defense  counsel himself\n\nprovoked many of the interruptions.\n\n     We have looked  at both the rulings  and the objections.\n\nThe former  were generally  well within the  district court's\n\ndiscretion, and most  of the latter  were at least  arguable.\n\nFor example, speaking of Santos, Zavala's counsel said to the\n\njury:   \"Remember  that [the  confidential informant]  is the\n\nperson   that  traditionally  he's  a  distrusted  individual\n\nbecause  he can  work  always  as  a  double  agent.\"    Many\n\nprosecutors would have let this pass; but here the prosecutor\n\nobjected (\"Objection,  your Honor.  Going  outside the record\n\n\"traditionally not to be  trusted.\"), and the judge sustained\n\nher  objection on  the ground  that it  was not  a reasonable\n\ninference from the evidence.\n\n                             -13-\n\n     What  inferences  can arguably  be  drawn  from specific\n\nevidence is  often a matter of degree and of judgment.  Trial\n\njudges themselves  differ in  their approaches, and  \"how far\n\nyou can go\" with a particular judge is the kind  of lore that\n\ncounsel  collect and  pass  on  to  each  other.    Here  the\n\nprosecutor operated  on a hair  trigger, and the  trial judge\n\nwas reasonably strict in governing the closing argument.  But\n\nthe fact  is that  there was  no evidence  as to the  general\n\ncharacter of  confidential  informants, nor  any evidence  to\n\nsuggest that Santos was dishonest or a double agent.\n\n     Without recounting  each objection,  we  think that  the\n\nprosecutor  was  right  or  arguably right  often  enough  to\n\nforeclose  any  suggestion that  her  aim was  to  impede the\n\ndefense; put differently, the defense summation provided some\n\nbasis for  legitimate complaint.  The  trial judge's rulings,\n\nsome  of  which  favored  the  defendant,   appear  eminently\n\nreasonable.    Finally,  based  on a  reading  of  the entire\n\ndefense  summation,  it   seems  to  us   that--despite  some\n\ninterruptions--the   essence   of   counsel's  argument   for\n\nacquittal was thoroughly conveyed to the jury.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                         Dissent follows.\n\n                             -14-\n\n     COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge (dissenting).  I    believe\n                                 \n\nthe court  errs by expanding the  definition of \"constructive\n\npossession\" beyond what is supported by the relevant caselaw,\n\nstretching the  statutory  reach  of  \"possession\"  under  21\n\nU.S.C.   841(a)(1) dangerously and unnecessarily far.\n\n     My colleagues concede that it is at least  arguable that\n\nZavala was not shown to possess the drugs while he and Santos\n              \n\nwere in the  room together;  and that had  the agents  broken\n\ninto the room and  arrested Zavala at this point,  a directed\n\nverdict of acquittal might have been required.  They contend,\n\nhowever, that once Zavala,  on Santos' suggestion, locked the\n\ndrugs  in his  hotel room  while the  two men  went to  get a\n\ndrink, Zavala  \"possessed\" the drugs, by virtue  of the facts\n\nthat  he had yielded actual possession of the drugs, and that\n\nhe  had priority  of access to  the room  in which  they were\n\nstored.  \n\n     The  court  reaches this  conclusion  by  relying on  an\n\ninterpretation  of \"constructive  possession\" which  I cannot\n\nhelp thinking is both incorrect and overbroad.  \"Constructive\n\npossession,\" as the majority  properly states, is established\n\nby  showing  that  a  person  knowingly  had  the  power  and\n                                                        \n\nintention at a  given time to  exercise dominion and  control\n         \n\nover  an object,  either  directly or  through  others.   See\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v. Acevedo,  842 F.2d 502, 507 (1st  Cir. 1988)\n                        \n\n(emphasis added).   The  court, in  turn, defines \"power\"  in\n\nphysical terms: in its view, the requisite  \"power\" exists if\n\n                             -15-\n\nthe contraband is  in a  location specially  accessible to  a\n\ndefendant,  such as  in one's  home, hotel  room, or  car, or\n\nlocated within his or her reach.\n\n     I am  persuaded that this reliance on  physical power of\n\naccess understates the law's  requirements.  Although, as the\n\ncourt   points  out,   a   lay   person's  understanding   of\n\n\"possession\" is not  helpful, I cannot so easily sidestep our\n\nand other courts' use of the word  \"dominion,\" which connotes\n\nownership or a right to property.  Black's Law Dictionary 486\n                                                         \n\n(6th ed. 1990).\n\n     More  importantly,  in  this  and  other  circuits,  the\n\ncaselaw  supports  a  reading  of \"power\"  as  the  right  or\n                                                         \n\nauthority to exercise control,  or dominion and control, over\n         \n\nsomething not in one's actual  possession.

Similarly,\n\nin   United  States  v.  Lamare,  we   upheld  a  finding  of\n                               \n\nconstructive possession of  a firearm that  had been left  as\n\ncollateral for a towing charge owed by the defendant, because\n\nthe  defendant \"could  have  taken actual  possession of  the\n\npistol  at any  time by paying  the towing  charge .  . . and\n\nintended to do so.\"  711 F.2d at 5-6. \n\n     The fact that contraband is located in a place specially\n\naccessible to a  defendant may be  sufficient to establish  a\n\ndefendant's power  to exercise  dominion or control  over it,\n\nand  thus support  a finding  of constructive  possession, if\n\nthere  is a  showing  that the  defendant  has the  right  or\n\nauthority to exercise control over the object at issue, or if\n\nthe record is silent  as to his  right or authority over  the\n\ncontraband.  But  here the  very facts  militating against  a\n\nfinding of  constructive possession  while Santos  and Zavala\n\nwere in the room together --  the fact that the drugs had not\n\nbeen  paid for,  the fact  that Zavala  was not  the intended\n\nrecipient, and Santos' refusal to follow  Zavala's suggestion\n\nto transfer  them to another  room -- effectively  refute any\n\npresumption that Zavala had any claim on the drugs.  \n\n                             -17-\n\n     None  of  the cases  cited by  the majority  support the\n\nconclusion that, where knowledge is admitted or inferred, the\n\nlocation of contraband  in a place specially  accessible to a\n\ndefendant,   without   more,  is   sufficient   to  establish\n\nconstructive possession.   For  example, in United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nEcheverri,  982 F.2d  675, 678  (1st Cir.  1993), it  was the\n         \n\n\"totality of the  circumstances\" -- the  fact that drugs  and\n\ndrug paraphernalia were found in  plain view, only four  feet\n\nfrom the defendant himself,  together with the fact that  the\n\ncontraband was found in  his apartment -- that  persuaded the\n\ncourt that the  evidence was sufficient to support  a finding\n\nof  constructive  possession.     And  in  United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nChapdelaine,  989 F.2d  28, 33-4 (1st  Cir. 1993),  the court\n           \n\nfound defendant  in constructive possession of  bullets found\n\nin his  bedroom closet based, in part,  on the fact that they\n\nmatched  those  in  a  firearm found  in  defendant's  actual\n\npossession.\n\n       In United  States v. Wight,  968 F.2d 1393,  1397 (1st\n                                 \n\nCir.  1992),  the  single case  cited  by  the majority  that\n\napproaches the  situation before us, a  jury convicted Wight,\n\nthe  passenger in a van  in which a  pistol was found between\n\nthe  driver's and  the  passenger's seat,  of possessing  the\n\npistol during  the drug trafficking crime,  but acquitted the\n\ndriver  of the  firearm  possession charge.    We upheld  the\n\nfinding  of Wight's  constructive possession of  the firearm,\n\nnoting  that based on evidence of Wight's leading role in the\n\n                             -18-\n\ndrug transaction, \"[i]t was reasonable for  the jury to infer\n\nthat he, and not [the driver], was in charge of the operation\n\nand, as such,  exercised control over [the  driver], the van,\n\nits contents, and the firearm.\"  Id. at 1398.  \n                                    \n\n     I find  more apposite the Seventh  Circuit's decision in\n\nUnited States v.  DiNovo, 523 F.2d 197  (7th Cir. 1975).   In\n                        \n\nDiNovo, the court reversed a wife's conviction for possession\n      \n\nof heroin, notwithstanding her cohabitation  with her husband\n\nin  a trailer  where  2  pounds  of  heroin  and  other  drug\n\nparaphernalia  were found.  Id.  at 201-02.   The court found\n                               \n\nthat  even if the wife knew of her husband's drug possession,\n\nthis  did not  mean that  she possessed  the drugs,  absent a\n\nshowing of her right to exercise control over them.  Id. \n                                                        \n\n     To the extent that the court jettisons all idea of legal\n\nright  or  practical claim  to  the  contraband and  assesses\n\n\"power\" in  terms of  physical capacity  to seize, it  vastly\n\nwidens the  concept of constructive  possession.   Contraband\n\nstored in the  locked box of a another  person could be found\n\nwithin the power of  a defendant skilled in  the use of  lock\n\npicking or explosives.  Or, in a case like Wight, the finding\n                                                \n\nas  to  constructive possession  would  turn  on whether  the\n\ndriver was bigger and tougher than the passenger.\n\n     The same  weakness affects  the court's reasoning  as to\n\nthe  presence of intent to exercise  dominion over the drugs.\n\nThe particular intent is not, as  the court would have it, to\n\nfacilitate transfer of the drugs to their intended recipient,\n\n                             -19-\n\nhis  presumed associate  Palestino.   The required  intent is\n\nthat defendant intends to exercise his claim of dominion over\n\nthe drugs, i.e., to take control  for himself.  So the court,\n\ninmy view, stretches thecontours of both\"power\" and \"intent.\"\n\n     Finally, we should remember why  we are of divided views\n\nabout the  propriety of  extending the scope  of constructive\n\npossession  beyond that  of any  apposite authority.    It is\n\nbecause, as the court correctly notes, Zavala could have been\n\ncharged  with  conspiracy to  possess  drugs  with intent  to\n\ndistribute  them, or  with  aiding and  abetting  Palestino's\n\nattempt to possess with intent to distribute.  But Zavala was\n\nnot so  charged; and the mere  fact that guilt is  in the air\n\nshould  not  allow us  to extend  the  reach of  the criminal\n\npossession statute in these circumstances.  There needs to be\n\nsome meaningful distinction  between the crime of  conspiracy\n\nto possess, and possession  itself.  The rule of  the present\n\ncase,  allowing   the   government  to   prove   constructive\n\npossession  simply by having a confidential informant deposit\n\ncontraband in a  hotel room  shared with a  target, and  then\n\nleave  the room with this person, with the arresting officers\n\nwaiting  until   the  door   shuts,  would  erode   any  such\n\ndistinction.\n\n     I am  uncomfortable in  taking this significant  step --\n\nparticularly where  the  purpose  served  is to  bail  out  a\n\nmaladroit prosecution.  I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n                             -20-\n",

There,  a drug  dealer  gave  Santos\n\nsixteen  packages of cocaine,  amounting to a  total of eight\n\nkilograms,  and asked  Santos to  deliver them  as instructed\n\nwhen the ship docked at the port of Ponce, Puerto Rico.  \n\n     Santos  had  earlier  been approached  by  American  law\n\nenforcement agents  attached to  the Customs Service,  and he\n\naccepted the cocaine  in Cartagena with  the approval of  the\n\n                    \n\n     1The  jury  acquitted  Zavala  of  two  other  charges--\nimporting cocaine into  the United States,  21 U.S.C.    952,\nand using a telephone to commit or facilitate  the possession\noffense,  21 U.S.C.     843(b)--and these  counts require  no\nfurther discussion.\n\n                             -2-\n\nagents, who intended to track the drugs to their destination.\n\nSantos  kept  the drugs  hidden  during  the  voyage and,  on\n\narriving  in Ponce,  conferred  immediately with  the agents.\n\nShortly  thereafter, Santos  under  surveillance  by  federal\n\nagents and cooperating local police,  went to the Hotel Melia\n\nin  Ponce  and asked  at the  front  desk for  Mr. Palestino.\n\nThese last two  steps complied with the instructions given to\n\nSantos  in  Catagena, by  the dealer  who  had given  him the\n\ncocaine,  to deliver it to  Palestino, at the  Hotel Melia in\n\nPonce.\n\n     When  the  clerk  called  from  the  desk  to  the  room\n\nregistered to  Palestino, the  defendant Zavala appeared  and\n\ngestured to  Santos to follow him to room 302.  There Santos,\n\nwho was  carrying the cocaine in  a bag, told Zavala  that he\n\nhad the drugs to be delivered to Palestino.  Zavala said that\n\nhe was a friend of Palestino and that Palestino would come to\n\nthe  hotel.  Using a cellular telephone, Zavala then placed a\n\ncall,  purportedly  to Palestino.    Then  at Santos'  urging\n\nZavala called a second time to ask Palestino to come quickly.\n\nZavala  asked Santos if they could put the cocaine in another\n\nhotel  room, saying that he (Zavala) had other friends in the\n\nhotel, but Santos refused.\n\n     As  time  passed and  Palestino  still  did not  arrive,\n\nSantos became increasingly anxious  and he proposed to Zavala\n\nthat  they go  out of the  room for  a soda.   Zavala agreed,\n\n                             -3-\n\nSantos  placed  the  bag with  the  cocaine  in  a closet  or\n\ndressing room  in room 302, and the two men left room 302 and\n\nentered  the corridor.   As  they went  down the  stairs, the\n\nsupervising   customs  agent  detained  them.    When  Santos\n\nexplained that  Palestino had  still not arrived,  Zavala was\n\ntaken  back to room 302 in custody, accompanied by Santos and\n\none  or more agents.   There were  several more calls  to the\n\nroom purportedly from Palestino, two or three on the cellular\n\ntelephone and one on the hotel telephone; in each case Santos\n\ntold the caller that Zavala was out or otherwise occupied.\n\n     Shortly after the  final call, the operation came  to an\n\nend.  Law  enforcement agents,  it appears, had  seen a  car,\n\nwith the  driver using a cellular  telephone, circling around\n\nthe hotel.   The driver then parked and went  into the hotel.\n\nHe  proceeded with  another  individual to  one of  the hotel\n\nrooms and entered.  When agents  then knocked on the door  of\n\nthis room,  the individuals  inside exited through  a window.\n\nAfter  a chase they  were caught, and  a search of  their car\n\nyielded a loaded nine millimeter pistol and $6,305 in cash.\n\n     This  final episode  was described  in testimony  at the\n\ntrial.  So  far as we know, neither the  driver nor the other\n\nman with him was  charged.  Possibly the police  thought that\n\nthe  evidence was  not  quite strong  enough  to prove  their\n\nparticipation in the drug deal.  Zavala, however, was charged\n\n                             -4-\n\nas  previously  described,   and  convicted  on  one   count:\n\npossession with intent to distribute.\n\n                             II.\n\n     Zavala's primary claim is  that an acquittal should have\n\nbeen  ordered on  grounds of  insufficient evidence  to prove\n\npossession.   We begin by  noting that on  this record Zavala\n\nwas  surely  guilty  of a  closely-related  offense,  namely,\n\nconspiracy to  possess drugs with intent  to distribute them.\n\n21  U.S.C.     841,  846.    An  agreement  with  the  absent\n\nPalestino is  readily inferred from  Zavala's statements  and\n\nthe  telephone  calls,  and  the object  of  the  agreement--\n\ntransferring a dealer-sized quantity of cocaine to Palestino-\n\n-is no  less apparent.    A slightly  more inventive  offense\n\nwould be a charge of  aiding and abetting Palestino's attempt\n                                                             \n\nto possess with intent to distribute, under  18 U.S.C.     2,\n\n841.  See, e.g., United States v. Kottmyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581406\"><a href=\"/opinion/581406/united-states-v-dennis-ray-kottmyer-91-5826-william-talmadge-upton/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th\n                                          \n\nCir. 1992).\n\n     But  Zavala was  not  charged with  conspiracy, or  with\n\naiding and abetting an attempt, nor did a jury convict him of\n\nsuch  crimes.  The  formalities of indictment  and jury trial\n\nare prescribed by the Constitution.   U.S. Const., Amends. V,\n\nVI.   Further, given that these offenses were not charged, it\n\nis  hardly  sufficient  to  say that  this  record  contained\n                                          \n\nevidence to  support such a  conviction for such  an offense.\n\nWe do not know what evidence  the record might contain if the\n\n                             -5-\n\ndefendant  had been given notice  that he was  charged with a\n\nquite different  offense (say, conspiracy) instead  of, or in\n\naddition to, the offense charged (here, possession).  \n\n     Thus the  conviction for possession can stand  only if a\n\nreasonable  jury  could  find  that Zavala  did  possess  the\n\ncocaine  within  the meaning  of  21 U.S.C.    841.    If the\n\nstatute  used  the  term  \"possess\"  as  a  lay  juror  might\n\nunderstand it prior to instructions from the  judge, it might\n\nbe  a stretch to say  that Zavala \"possessed\"  the cocaine in\n\nthe  bag.  There is no evidence  that he even touched the bag\n\nor saw the cocaine or that he was ever alone in the room with\n\nit  or that he had a  practical opportunity to remove it from\n\nthe hotel.  These facts explain why Zavala's main argument on\n\nappeal  is that  his relationship  to the  cocaine cannot  be\n\ndeemed \"possession.\"\n\n     The difficulty with  the argument is that the concept of\n\npossession in the drug statute comes freighted with a history\n\nof  interpretation.   Congress  was here  concerned not  with\n\n\"possession\" in  a narrowly  focused situation (e.g.,  actual\n                                                    \n\npossession of a weapon on an aircraft) but with possession of\n\ndrugs incident to their distribution.   There is every reason\n\nto think that Congress wished to cast its net widely so that,\n\nassuming  mens rea, a  defendant proximately  associated with\n                  \n\nthe  drugs would be reached  by the statute.   The prevailing\n\n                             -6-\n\ninterpretation of \"possession,\" in  the framework of the drug\n\nstatutes, reflects that broad reach.  \n\n     Under settled law, \"possession\" includes not merely  the\n\nstate of  immediate, hands-on  physical  possession but  also\n\n\"constructive\"   possession,  including   possession  through\n\nanother, and joint as well as exclusive possession.   Further\n\nthese  concepts can be combined  so that, for example, \"joint\n\nconstructive possession\" is quite as bad as  having the drugs\n\nexclusively in  one's own  pocket.   E.g.,  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nBatista-Polanco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556636\"><a href=\"/opinion/556636/united-states-v-johnny-rafael-batista-polanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  18-19 (1st Cir. 1991).   These\n               \n\nconcepts  of  constructive and  joint  possession are  almost\n\nuniformly  reflected  in  both  decisions2  and  in  standard\n\ninstructions.3 \n\n     \"Constructive\" possession  is  commonly defined  as  the\n\npower  and intention  to  exercise control,  or dominion  and\n\ncontrol,  over an  object not  in one's  \"actual\" possession.\n\nE.g., United States v. Acevedo, supra, 842  F.2d at 507.  The\n                                     \n\n\"constructive possession\" label may confuse jurors at first--\n\ndrug trial juries  routinely ask  to be  reinstructed on  the\n\ndefinition   of  possession--but   the  underlying   idea  is\n\n                    \n\n     2See,  e.g., United  States v.

Courts  are saying\n\nthat one  can possess an object while it is hidden at home in\n\na bureau drawer, or while held  by an agent, or even while it\n\nis  secured in  a safe  deposit box  at the  bank and  can be\n\nretrieved only when  a bank  official opens the  vault.   The\n\nproblem is not so much with the idea as with deciding how far\n\nit should be carried.\n\n     Here,  we think is at least arguable that Zavala was not\n                                                             \n\nshown  to possess the  drugs while he and  Santos were in the\n\nroom together.   Santos  apparently had exclusive  control of\n\nthe bag during this period.   It contained drugs for which he\n\nhad not been paid; Zavala was not the named person to whom it\n\nwas to  be delivered; and Santos  refused Zavala's suggestion\n\nthat  the bag  be entrusted  to Zavala's  friends in  another\n\nroom.  If  the agents had  broken into the room  and arrested\n\nZavala  at this point, a  directed verdict of acquittal might\n\nhave been required.\n\n     But once both parties departed from the room leaving the\n\ndrugs inside, the situation  altered.  It is not  that Zavala\n\ngot closer to  the drugs--indeed, he moved further  away from\n\nthem--but  rather  that   two  other  circumstances  changed:\n\nfirst, Santos surrendered his  actual possession of them; and\n\nsecond, with the acquiescence of both parties, the drugs were\n\nsecured in  Zavala's room.  In  the context of  this case, we\n\nthink  that  a  jury  could  then  find  both  requisites  of\n\n                             -8-\n\nconstructive possession:  that Zavala had sufficient power to\n\ncontrol the drugs and an intention to exercise that power.\n\n     Turning first to the power to exercise control, we begin\n                               \n\nwith the fact that the drugs were left in Zavala's  room with\n\nhis  knowledge  and consent  while  Zavala  was awaiting  the\n\narrival of  an accomplice  to pay  for them.   It is  fair to\n\ndescribe  the location as Zavala's  hotel room because he was\n\neffectively in occupation and the jury could reasonably infer\n\nthat he could return there at will.  The evidence showed that\n\nthe room,  although registered in Palestino's  name, had been\n\nlent to two occupants.  It was Zavala who emerged when Santos\n\narrived at  the hotel and  the room  was called;  and it  was\n\nZavala  who took  Santos to  the room  to await  \"his friend\"\n\nPalestino.  \n\n     The location of drugs or firearms in a  defendant's home\n\nor  car is a common  basis for attributing  possession to the\n\ndefendant.4  This  is so  even if  the residence  or room  is\n\nshared  by others.

But by the  same token a  jury could\n\ninfer that drugs  now stored in Zavala's hotel room, awaiting\n\ntransfer to Zavala's accomplice, were at least as much within\n\nZavala's power to control  as within Santos' power.   If each\n\nhad an effective veto over the other, it would still be joint\n\npossession.  Two drug  dealers with cocaine in the  back seat\n\nof  their car might both possess it even though neither would\n\nlet the  other out  of sight.   Cf. United  States v.  Wight,\n                                                            \n\nsupra, 968 F.2d at 1398 (weapon in car given to one defendant\n     \n\n\"possessed\" by the other where in reach of both).  \n\n     The  issue of  intention is  quite as  important  as the\n                             \n\nissue of  power.   Someone  might have  effective power  over\n\ndrugs  simply because  they were  located within  reach while\n\ntheir true owner was temporarily absent; but if such a person\n\nhad power over the drugs (say, as a  temporary visitor to the\n\nroom  in which  they were  located) but  had no  intention to\n\nexercise  that power, there might  still be no  crime.  Here,\n\nZavala's connection with  the drugs stored in  his hotel room\n\nwas not at all innocent:  the drugs were stored there for the\n\n                             -10-\n\npurpose (so far as Zavala knew  and intended) of facilitating\n\ntheir transfer to his accomplice, Palestino.\n\n     In  many cases,  intention  and knowledge  are  inferred\n\nsolely from the location of the drugs in an area to which the\n\ndefendant  has a priority of access.  Here, Zavala's state of\n\nmind is established by  independent evidence:  his statements\n\nthat  Palestino would be there  soon, his suggestion that the\n\ndrugs be stored temporarily  in another room, apparently with\n\nhis  confederates; and  by  the cellular  telephone calls  by\n\nZavala and to  him seemingly from  Palestino.  No  reasonable\n\njury could have had any doubt that Zavala was there to assist\n\nin the transmission of the drugs lodged in his room.\n\n     Assuming Zavala's guilty mind,  it might still be argued\n\nthat  his precise  intention was  to aid  in the  storage and\n\ntransfer of the  drugs but not  to \"control\" the  drugs.   We\n\nthink this is  too fine a distinction.  Defendant's intention\n\nto  have  the drugs  stored in  his  room, incident  to their\n\nintended transfer  to a confederate, seems to us an intention\n\nintimately  related to his power to control  the drugs.  If a\n\njury  finds this  to be  constructive  possession, we  do not\n\nthink that it has  stretched the concept too far  or betrayed\n\nthe intention of Congress.\n\n          Finally,  it  is  beside  the  point that  Zavala's\n\n\"possession\"  in the  hallway  was extremely  brief and  that\n\nZavala probably could not have escaped with the drugs because\n\n                             -11-\n\nof  the police surveillance.  That the police are present and\n\nready to  frustrate distribution does not  make possession of\n\ndrugs any less a crime, and a minute of possession is as much\n\nan offense  as a year of possession.   See Santiago v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532030\"><a href=\"/opinion/532030/ariel-santiago-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 376  (1st Cir.  1989).   If Palestino\n      \n\nhimself had arrived  and Santos  had handed him  the bag,  he\n\nwould  be guilty of possession  even if the  police had burst\n\ninto the room  sixty seconds  later.  The  completion of  the\n\ncrime  does not  require that  the defendant have  a sporting\n\nchance. \n\n                             III.\n\n     We  turn to Zavala's other  main claim of  error on this\n\nappeal.    Zavala  contends  that  the  prosecutor  so  often\n\ninterrupted  the  defense  summation with  objections  as  to\n\nconstitute misconduct  and to  prevent the jury  from hearing\n\nthe  defense's  closing  argument.    We  have  reviewed  the\n\ncomplete  transcript  of  defense  counsel's   summation  and\n\nconclude that  misconduct did not  occur nor was  the defense\n\nsummation seriously impaired.\n\n     It is  quite true that the  prosecutor's objections were\n\nnumerous.  Zavala's brief claims that 20 objections were made\n\nin  an  argument  that  covered  37  transcript  pages.   The\n\ngovernment's brief may also miss the mark by arguing that the\n\nclaim  now made was waived because not argued to the district\n\ncourt:    defense  counsel  did  state,  after  a  number  of\n\n                             -12-\n\nobjections from the prosecutor,  \"I have an objection  to the\n\ncontinuous  interruptions.\"   This is  the same  argument now\n\nrenewed on appeal.\n\n     But if the objection was preserved, it was also  largely\n\nanswered by  the trial judge's rejoinder  to defense counsel:\n\n\"Well, then you behave better.  Stick to the facts before the\n\nCourt  and   before  the   jury  and   you  won't  have   any\n\ninterruptions.\"   The  fact is  that most  of the  objections\n\nruled on by the judge  were sustained on the ground that  the\n\ndefense  counsel  was  arguing  facts  outside  the   record,\n\nmisstating evidence, or misstating the law.  Unless the trial\n\njudge was  mistaken in  his rulings, defense  counsel himself\n\nprovoked many of the interruptions.\n\n     We have looked  at both the rulings  and the objections.\n\nThe former  were generally  well within the  district court's\n\ndiscretion, and most  of the latter  were at least  arguable.\n\nFor example, speaking of Santos, Zavala's counsel said to the\n\njury:   \"Remember  that [the  confidential informant]  is the\n\nperson   that  traditionally  he's  a  distrusted  individual\n\nbecause  he can  work  always  as  a  double  agent.\"    Many\n\nprosecutors would have let this pass; but here the prosecutor\n\nobjected (\"Objection,  your Honor.  Going  outside the record\n\n\"traditionally not to be  trusted.\"), and the judge sustained\n\nher  objection on  the ground  that it  was not  a reasonable\n\ninference from the evidence.\n\n                             -13-\n\n     What  inferences  can arguably  be  drawn  from specific\n\nevidence is  often a matter of degree and of judgment.  Trial\n\njudges themselves  differ in  their approaches, and  \"how far\n\nyou can go\" with a particular judge is the kind  of lore that\n\ncounsel  collect and  pass  on  to  each  other.    Here  the\n\nprosecutor operated  on a hair  trigger, and the  trial judge\n\nwas reasonably strict in governing the closing argument.  But\n\nthe fact  is that  there was  no evidence  as to the  general\n\ncharacter of  confidential  informants, nor  any evidence  to\n\nsuggest that Santos was dishonest or a double agent.\n\n     Without recounting  each objection,  we  think that  the\n\nprosecutor  was  right  or  arguably right  often  enough  to\n\nforeclose  any  suggestion that  her  aim was  to  impede the\n\ndefense; put differently, the defense summation provided some\n\nbasis for  legitimate complaint.  The  trial judge's rulings,\n\nsome  of  which  favored  the  defendant,   appear  eminently\n\nreasonable.    Finally,  based  on a  reading  of  the entire\n\ndefense  summation,  it   seems  to  us   that--despite  some\n\ninterruptions--the   essence   of   counsel's  argument   for\n\nacquittal was thoroughly conveyed to the jury.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                         Dissent follows.\n\n                             -14-\n\n     COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge (dissenting).  I    believe\n                                 \n\nthe court  errs by expanding the  definition of \"constructive\n\npossession\" beyond what is supported by the relevant caselaw,\n\nstretching the  statutory  reach  of  \"possession\"  under  21\n\nU.S.C.   841(a)(1) dangerously and unnecessarily far.\n\n     My colleagues concede that it is at least  arguable that\n\nZavala was not shown to possess the drugs while he and Santos\n              \n\nwere in the  room together;  and that had  the agents  broken\n\ninto the room and  arrested Zavala at this point,  a directed\n\nverdict of acquittal might have been required.  They contend,\n\nhowever, that once Zavala,  on Santos' suggestion, locked the\n\ndrugs  in his  hotel room  while the  two men  went to  get a\n\ndrink, Zavala  \"possessed\" the drugs, by virtue  of the facts\n\nthat  he had yielded actual possession of the drugs, and that\n\nhe  had priority  of access to  the room  in which  they were\n\nstored.  \n\n     The  court  reaches this  conclusion  by  relying on  an\n\ninterpretation  of \"constructive  possession\" which  I cannot\n\nhelp thinking is both incorrect and overbroad.  \"Constructive\n\npossession,\" as the majority  properly states, is established\n\nby  showing  that  a  person  knowingly  had  the  power  and\n                                                        \n\nintention at a  given time to  exercise dominion and  control\n         \n\nover  an object,  either  directly or  through  others.   See\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v.

The  court, in  turn, defines \"power\"  in\n\nphysical terms: in its view, the requisite  \"power\" exists if\n\n                             -15-\n\nthe contraband is  in a  location specially  accessible to  a\n\ndefendant,  such as  in one's  home, hotel  room, or  car, or\n\nlocated within his or her reach.\n\n     I am  persuaded that this reliance on  physical power of\n\naccess understates the law's  requirements.  Although, as the\n\ncourt   points  out,   a   lay   person's  understanding   of\n\n\"possession\" is not  helpful, I cannot so easily sidestep our\n\nand other courts' use of the word  \"dominion,\" which connotes\n\nownership or a right to property.

Similarly,\n\nin   United  States  v.

But  here the  very facts  militating against  a\n\nfinding of  constructive possession  while Santos  and Zavala\n\nwere in the room together --  the fact that the drugs had not\n\nbeen  paid for,  the fact  that Zavala  was not  the intended\n\nrecipient, and Santos' refusal to follow  Zavala's suggestion\n\nto transfer  them to another  room -- effectively  refute any\n\npresumption that Zavala had any claim on the drugs.  \n\n                             -17-\n\n     None  of  the cases  cited by  the majority  support the\n\nconclusion that, where knowledge is admitted or inferred, the\n\nlocation of contraband  in a place specially  accessible to a\n\ndefendant,   without   more,  is   sufficient   to  establish\n\nconstructive possession.   For  example, in United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nEcheverri,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597415\"><a href=\"/opinion/597415/united-states-v-marco-a-echeverri/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678  (1st Cir.  1993), it  was the\n         \n\n\"totality of the  circumstances\" -- the  fact that drugs  and\n\ndrug paraphernalia were found in  plain view, only four  feet\n\nfrom the defendant himself,  together with the fact that  the\n\ncontraband was found in  his apartment -- that  persuaded the\n\ncourt that the  evidence was sufficient to support  a finding\n\nof  constructive  possession.

We upheld  the\n\nfinding  of Wight's  constructive possession of  the firearm,\n\nnoting  that based on evidence of Wight's leading role in the\n\n                             -18-\n\ndrug transaction, \"[i]t was reasonable for  the jury to infer\n\nthat he, and not [the driver], was in charge of the operation\n\nand, as such,  exercised control over [the  driver], the van,\n\nits contents, and the firearm.\"  Id. at 1398.  \n                                    \n\n     I find  more apposite the Seventh  Circuit's decision in\n\nUnited States v.

In\n                        \n\nDiNovo, the court reversed a wife's conviction for possession\n      \n\nof heroin, notwithstanding her cohabitation  with her husband\n\nin  a trailer  where  2  pounds  of  heroin  and  other  drug\n\nparaphernalia  were found.  Id.  at 201-02.   The court found\n                               \n\nthat  even if the wife knew of her husband's drug possession,\n\nthis  did not  mean that  she possessed  the drugs,  absent a\n\nshowing of her right to exercise control over them.  Id. \n                                                        \n\n     To the extent that the court jettisons all idea of legal\n\nright  or  practical claim  to  the  contraband and  assesses\n\n\"power\" in  terms of  physical capacity  to seize, it  vastly\n\nwidens the  concept of constructive  possession.   Contraband\n\nstored in the  locked box of a another  person could be found\n\nwithin the power of  a defendant skilled in  the use of  lock\n\npicking or explosives.  Or, in a case like Wight, the finding\n                                                \n\nas  to  constructive possession  would  turn  on whether  the\n\ndriver was bigger and tougher than the passenger.\n\n     The same  weakness affects  the court's reasoning  as to\n\nthe  presence of intent to exercise  dominion over the drugs.\n\nThe particular intent is not, as  the court would have it, to\n\nfacilitate transfer of the drugs to their intended recipient,\n\n                             -19-\n\nhis  presumed associate  Palestino.   The required  intent is\n\nthat defendant intends to exercise his claim of dominion over\n\nthe drugs, i.e., to take control  for himself.  So the court,\n\ninmy view, stretches thecontours of both\"power\" and \"intent.\"\n\n     Finally, we should remember why  we are of divided views\n\nabout the  propriety of  extending the scope  of constructive\n\npossession  beyond that  of any  apposite authority.    It is\n\nbecause, as the court correctly notes, Zavala could have been\n\ncharged  with  conspiracy to  possess  drugs  with intent  to\n\ndistribute  them, or  with  aiding and  abetting  Palestino's\n\nattempt to possess with intent to distribute.  But Zavala was\n\nnot so  charged; and the mere  fact that guilt is  in the air\n\nshould  not  allow us  to extend  the  reach of  the criminal\n\npossession statute in these circumstances.  There needs to be\n\nsome meaningful distinction  between the crime of  conspiracy\n\nto possess, and possession  itself.  The rule of  the present\n\ncase,  allowing   the   government  to   prove   constructive\n\npossession  simply by having a confidential informant deposit\n\ncontraband in a  hotel room  shared with a  target, and  then\n\nleave  the room with this person, with the arresting officers\n\nwaiting  until   the  door   shuts,  would  erode   any  such\n\ndistinction.\n\n     I am  uncomfortable in  taking this significant  step --\n\nparticularly where  the  purpose  served  is to  bail  out  a\n\nmaladroit prosecution.  I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n                             -20-\n</pre>",
