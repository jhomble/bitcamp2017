Upon  a careful  review  of  the\n\nparties' briefs and the record, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict  court for essentially the reasons  set forth in the\n\nReport and  Recommendation of  the magistrate  judge and  the\n\nOpinion  and Order denying  appellant's motion to  vacate his\n\nsentence and conviction.\n\n          After  the   report  of   the  magistrate   issued,\n\nappellant raised an additional question:  The stand-committed\n\nfine  part  of  his  sentence  is  unconstitutional   because\n\nappellant lacks  the ability to  pay the fine.   He concludes\n\nthat the  fine should  be vacated.   In  the case of  \"mixed\"\n\nsentences combining  substantial terms  of imprisonment  with\n\nfines imposed upon  prisoners who claim to be impecunious, we\n\nwill  not rule upon  the fine's constitutionality  \"until the\n\nprisoner has exhausted available administrative remedies,  or\n\nhas begun, or is on  the verge of beginning, serving  time in\n\nconsequence  of the  fine's nonpayment.\"    United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nLevy, 897 F.2d 596, 598 (1st Cir. 1990).\n    \n\n          To  the extent appellant  believes that he  will be\n\nforced to stay in prison until the fine is paid, 18  U.S.C.  \n\n3569 (Discharge of an indigent prisoner) provides that upon a\n\nshowing of indigency, he may obtain his discharge even though\n\nhe has not paid the fine.  Because appellant's release is not\n\nimminent, and since other legal avenues are available to him,\n\nthere  is no  reason to  speculate  now about  the course  of\n\nfuture events.
