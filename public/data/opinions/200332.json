Gene Carter, District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n               Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Deirdre M. Smith, with whom was Drummond Woodsum & MacMahon on\nthe brief for appellants.\n\n     William J. Kayatta, Jr., with whom were Margaret Coughlin\nLePage, Joanne H. Pearson and Pierce Atwood on the brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                        February 11, 2003\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge.    Kathryn McInnis-Misenor, age 43,\n\nsuffers from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and uses a wheelchair.\n\nShe and her husband are attempting to have a second child, but she\n\nis not yet pregnant.    Anticipating that she will become pregnant,\n\nthey brought suit in federal court in October 2001. The complaint,\n\nas amended in March 2002, alleged that the Maine Medical Center\n\n(\"MMC\") was in violation of the architectural barrier provisions of\n\nTitle III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12182 (2000), and the Maine Human Rights Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 5, § 4592 (West 2002).    They seek an injunction to force MMC\n\n-- the nearest hospital that handles high risk deliveries (as hers\n\nwould be) -- to move walls in the Family Center to make the\n\nbathrooms wheelchair-accessible.       The Family Center is an after-\n\nbirth recovery area of rooms usually used, when available, by newly\n\ndelivered mothers.     If such rooms are not available, the mothers\n\nremain in the newer Birth Center rooms, in a different wing of MMC,\n\nwhere the delivery actually takes place.\n\n          McInnis-Misenor has reason for concern about her access\n\nto the Family Center.    She gave birth to her first child at MMC in\n\nNovember 1999.   At that time, MMC spent $5,300 to reconfigure a\n\nprivate room in the Birth Center to make it available to her.     Due\n\nto complications associated with her giving birth, she was unable\n\nto transfer to the Family Center and remained in the Birth Center\n\nfor the duration of her recovery.       Even if she had not suffered\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fthose complications, moving her to the Family Center was not a\n\nviable option because no room in that wing had toilet and shower\n\nfacilities configured to be wheelchair-accessible.\n\n           In April 2000, McInnis-Misenor filed a complaint with the\n\nMaine Human Rights Commission alleging violations of the Maine\n\nHuman Rights Act, based on her November 1999 experience.                       The\n\nCommission investigated and issued a report, which we shall refer\n\nto later, and which the district court considered. Among the claims\n\nmade to the Commission was that MMC failed to remove architectural\n\nbarriers in the Family Center.\n\n           A magistrate judge, acting on MMC's Rule 12(b)(6) motion,\n\nrecommended that the action be dismissed because the plaintiffs did\n\nnot at present have standing to bring their claims.                     McInnis-\n\nMisenor v. Me. Med. Ctr., 211 F. Supp. 2d 256, 257 (D. Me. 2002).\n\nThe   district   judge    agreed   and      dismissed   the   action,   without\n\nprejudice, on July 30, 2002.          Plaintiffs appeal.\n\n                                       I.\n\n           Our   review    of   the   decision    to    dismiss   for   lack    of\n\nstanding is de novo.       Mangual v. Rotger-Sabat, No. 02-1669, 2003\n\nU.S. App. LEXIS 857, at *14 (1st Cir. Jan. 21, 2003).\n\n           Normally on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, only the\n\ncomplaint is reviewed.      However, where standing is at issue, it is\n\nwithin the trial court's power to allow or to require the plaintiff\n\nto    provide    by   affidavit       or     amended     complaint      \"further\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fparticularized allegations of fact deemed supportive of plaintiff's\n\nstanding.\"   Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501 (1975).              Here the\n\ndistrict court also considered the Commission Report.1\n\n           The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden\n\nto establish standing.        Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167-68\n\n(1997). The plaintiffs initially argue that the district court\n\nerred in not taking all factual inferences from the complaint in\n\ntheir favor, as is required on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.                     The\n\nargument is misplaced. We and the district court both have assumed\n\nit to be true that McInnis-Misenor is disabled, that plaintiffs are\n\nattempting to have another child, that they will use MMC (a place\n\nof public accommodation) for any delivery, and that at present the\n\nFamily Center cannot accommodate her.       But Rule 12(b)(6) does not\n\nrequire we make the inferences necessary to establish that there is\n\nfederal jurisdiction.\n\n                                     II.\n\nA.   Standing: Constitutional and Prudential\n\n           Federal   courts    are   confined   by   Article   III    of   the\n\nConstitution to deciding only actual cases or controversies. Allen\n\nv. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750 (1984).            Federal courts can only\n\ndecide a \"live grievance.\"      Am. Postal Workers Union v. Frank, 968\n\n\n\n      1\n          The Commission Report is an official public record and\nfor that reason could be considered by the court in deciding a Rule\n(12)(b)(6) motion. See Alternative Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire\n& Marine Ins. Co., 267 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                     -4-\n\fF.2d 1373, 1374 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting Golden v. Zwickler, 394\n\nU.S. 103, 110 (1969)).              Standing is thus a threshold question in\n\nevery case, requiring the court to determine \"whether the plaintiff\n\nhas   'alleged     such       a    personal   stake   in   the    outcome   of   the\n\ncontroversy'       as    to       warrant   []    invocation     of   federal-court\n\njurisdiction.\"          See Warth, 422 U.S. at 498-99 (quoting Baker v.\n\nCarr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962)).                   The constitutional standing\n\ninquiry has three elements. A litigant bears the burden of showing\n\n\"that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury\n\nas a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant, and\n\nthat the injury fairly can be traced to the challenged action and\n\nis likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\"                     See Valley\n\nForge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church &\n\nState,     Inc.,   454     U.S.      464,   472   (1982)   (internal    quotations\n\nomitted).      As this court has noted, \"Article III standing is\n\nlargely -- albeit not entirely -- a practical jurisprudence.\" N.H.\n\nHemp Council, Inc. v. Marshall, 203 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(citing 13 C.A. Wright, A.R. Miller & E.H. Cooper, Federal Practice\n\n& Procedure § 3531.1, at 352, 355-56, 362-63 (2d ed. 1984)).\n\n             The plaintiffs' claim here involves a threat of future\n\ninjury.2     The parties dispute the degree of threat presented by\n\n\n      2\n              While plaintiff pursues a state law claim for damages\narising    from her 1999 hospitalization, the ADA precludes her from\nseeking    damages in architectural barrier claims unless the Attorney\nGeneral    assumes the case. 42 U.S.C. § 12188(b). Further, as a\nfactual     matter, a claim based on the 1999 events suffers from a\n\n                                            -5-\n\fthese facts to the plaintiffs' legal interests.               Plaintiffs must\n\nshow that the threatened injury is impending and concrete, see\n\nValley Forge, 454 U.S. at 472, sufficient to constitute \"injury in\n\nfact.\" There must be some immediacy or imminence to the threatened\n\ninjury.    See Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-02 (1983); see\n\nalso Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990)(quoting Lyons,\n\n461 U.S. at 101-02).\n\n            The    standing   inquiry    \"involves   both      constitutional\n\nlimitations       on   federal-court      jurisdiction        and   prudential\n\nlimitations on its exercise.\"          Warth, 422 U.S. at 498; see also\n\nBarrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249, 255-56 (1953) (describing Court's\n\n\"complementary rule of self-restraint for its own governance\" that\n\nexists    alongside    constitutional     restriction    on    jurisdiction).\n\nFederal courts have identified a number of prudential concerns\n\nregarding the proper exercise of federal jurisdiction.               Three of\n\nthese areas are well-established: (1) the complaint must \"fall\n\nwithin the zone of interests protected by the law invoked\"; (2) the\n\nplaintiff \"must assert his own legal rights and interests, and\n\ncannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of\n\nthird parties\"; and (3) the suit must present more than \"abstract\n\nquestions of wide public significance which amount to generalized\n\ngrievances, pervasively shared and most appropriately addressed in\n\n\ncausation problem: she was too sick to move to the Family Center\nin any case. As a result, it is only the prospect of future injury\nwhich is at issue here.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fthe representative branches.\"   N.H. Right to Life Political Action\n\nComm. v. Gardner, 99 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting Allen, 468\n\nU.S. at 751; Warth, 422 U.S. at 499; Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at\n\n475); see also Adams v. Watson, 10 F.3d 915, 918 n.7 (1st Cir.\n\n1993); United States v. AVX Corp., 962 F.2d 108, 114 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).\n\n          Prudential standing concerns, unlike constitutional ones,\n\ncan be abrogated by an act of Congress.     \"Congress may grant an\n\nexpress right of action to persons who otherwise would be barred by\n\nprudential standing rules.\"   Warth, 422 U.S. at 501.   We start with\n\nthe language of the ADA.   The enforcement provisions of Title III\n\nof the ADA are set forth in § 308, which provides:\n\n          The remedies and procedures set forth in section 204(a)\n          of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a-3(a))\n          are the remedies and procedures this title provides to\n          any person who is being subjected to discrimination on\n          the basis of disability in violation of this title or who\n          has reasonable grounds for believing that such person is\n          about to be subjected to discrimination in violation of\n          section 303. Nothing in this section shall require a\n          person with a disability to engage in a futile gesture if\n          such person has actual notice that a person or\n          organization covered by this title does not intend to\n          comply with its provisions.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1).   McInnis-Misenor is not \"being subjected\n\nto discrimination,\" so her claim must rest on whether she \"has\n\nreasonable grounds for believing [she] is about to be subjected to\n\ndiscrimination.\"   The statutory language \"about to be subjected to\n\ndiscrimination\" dovetails with the usual prudential analysis as to\n\nwhether McInnis-Misenor's claims are too contingent and premature.\n\n                                -7-\n\f            McInnis-Misenor cites some ADA cases to us, all factually\n\ndistinguishable.        This is not, for example, a case in which the\n\nexistence of architectural barriers is the only reason the ADA\n\nplaintiff has not returned for services.              E.g., Parr v. L&L Drive-\n\nInn Rest., 96 F. Supp. 2d 1065, 1079-80 (D. Hi. 2000) (finding\n\nstanding for a plaintiff prevented from using fast food chain\n\nrestaurant due to various architectural barriers because of his\n\nsincere intent to return as evidenced by his past patronage and\n\ntaste for the chain's food).               The ADA does not permit private\n\nplaintiffs    to   bring    claims    as        private    attorneys    general     to\n\nvindicate other people's injuries.\n\n             The   statutory   requirement          that    plaintiff    must      have\n\nreasonable grounds to believe she \"is about to be subjected to\n\ndiscrimination\"      does   not,     in    our     view,    displace    the   normal\n\nbackground prudential standing limitations.                 See Bennett, 520 U.S.\n\nat   163   (\"Congress    legislates        against    the    background       of   our\n\nprudential standing doctrine, which applies unless it is expressly\n\nnegated.\"); cf. Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 617 n.3\n\n(1973) (noting that while Congress may not confer jurisdiction to\n\nrender advisory opinions, Congress does have the power to enact\n\nstatutes expanding standing through the creation of new legal\n\nrights).\n\nB.   Ripeness: Constitutional and Prudential\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f             In general, standing and ripeness inquiries overlap. See\n\n13A Wright, Miller & Cooper, supra, § 3531.12, at 51 (\"The most\n\ndirect connections [among justiciability doctrines] run between\n\nstanding and ripeness.\"); see also Warth, 422 U.S. at 499 n.10\n\n(\"The standing question thus bears close affinity to questions of\n\nripeness -- whether the harm asserted has matured sufficiently to\n\nwarrant judicial intervention . . . .\").        The overlap is most\n\napparent in cases that deny standing because an anticipated injury\n\nis too remote, for example.    13A Wright, Miller & Cooper, supra, §\n\n3531.12, at 51.      Ripeness, standing, and mootness3 are closely\n\nlinked:\n\n             Ripeness and mootness easily could be seen as the time\n             dimensions of standing. Each assumes that an asserted\n             injury would be adequate; ripeness then asks whether an\n             injury that has not yet happened is sufficiently likely\n             to happen, and mootness asks whether an injury that has\n             happened is too far beyond a useful remedy.\n\nId. at 50.    Ripeness, however, can be thought of as focusing on the\n\n\"when\" of litigation, as opposed to the \"who.\" See E. Chemerinsky,\n\nFederal Jurisdiction § 2.4.1, at 114 (3d ed. 1999).          Even if\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          While mootness in general is irrelevant to the case at\nhand -- as McInnis-Misenor complains of future injuries, not past\nones -- an interest protected by one aspect of mootness analysis\nmight be thought to be pertinent here: the \"capable of repetition,\nyet evading review\" exception. See S. Pac. Terminal Co. v. ICC,\n219 U.S. 498, 515 (1911). Because some injuries occur and are over\nso quickly that they will always be moot before federal litigation\nis complete, such injuries are deemed an exception to the ordinary\nmootness doctrine.    See E. Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction §\n2.5.3, at 132 (3d ed. 1999).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fplaintiffs were the appropriate \"who,\" the question of \"when\"\n\nremains.\n\n            The test to be applied in ripeness analysis is whether\n\n\"there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse\n\nlegal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the\n\nissuance of a declaratory judgment.\"             Lake Carriers' Ass'n v.\n\nMacMullan, 406 U.S. 498, 506 (1972).           The ripeness doctrine seeks\n\n\"to   prevent    the      courts,    through     avoidance     of   premature\n\nadjudication,      from      entangling        themselves      in    abstract\n\ndisagreements.\" Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148 (1967).\n\nDetermining ripeness involves a dual inquiry: evaluation of \"both\n\nthe fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to\n\nthe parties of withholding court consideration.\" Id. at 149. Both\n\nprongs of the test must be satisfied, although a strong showing on\n\none may compensate for a weak one on the other.             See Ernst & Young\n\nv. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp., 45 F.3d 530, 535 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nLike standing, ripeness has both constitutional and prudential\n\nelements.   See Reno v. Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc., 509 U.S. 43, 57\n\nn.18 (1993); 13A Wright, Miller & Cooper, supra, § 3532.1, at 118.\n\n            In   the   fitness      inquiry,    both   constitutional    and\n\nprudential concerns operate, with prudential concerns focusing on\n\nthe policy of judicial restraint from unnecessary decisions.             The\n\nfitness inquiry \"typically involves subsidiary queries concerning\n\nfinality, definiteness, and the extent to which resolution of the\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fchallenge depends          on    facts    that   may   not   yet   be    sufficiently\n\ndeveloped.\"        Stern v. U.S. Dist. Court, 214 F.3d 4, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (quoting Ernst & Young, 45 F.3d at 535).                          \"The critical\n\nquestion   concerning           fitness   for    review   is   whether     the     claim\n\ninvolves uncertain and contingent events that may not occur as\n\nanticipated or may not occur at all.\"                  Ernst & Young, 45 F.3d at\n\n536 (quoting Mass. Ass'n of Afro-Am. Police, Inc. v. Boston Police\n\nDep't, 973 F.2d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 1992)).                  The fact that an event\n\nhas not occurred can be counterbalanced in this analysis by the\n\nfact   that    a    case   turns     on    legal   issues      \"not     likely    to   be\n\nsignificantly affected by further factual development.\"                          Ernst &\n\nYoung, 45 F.3d at 536.\n\n              The second prong -- hardship -- is entirely prudential.\n\nThe hardship prong evaluates \"the extent to which withholding\n\njudgment will impose hardship -- an inquiry that typically turns\n\nupon whether the challenged action creates a 'direct and immediate'\n\ndilemma for the parties.\"            Stern, 214 F.3d at 10 (quoting Abbott\n\nLabs., 387 U.S. at 152).           The greater the hardship, the more likely\n\na court will be to find ripeness.                Ernst & Young, 45 F.3d at 536.\n\nThis inquiry encompasses the question of whether plaintiff is\n\nsuffering any present injury from a future contemplated event. See\n\nReg'l Rail Reorganiz. Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 143 n.29 (1974); 1\n\nL. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 3-10, at 337 (3d ed. 2000);\n\nsee also Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 242-43 (1982) (assessing\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\funder standing both the injury to the church from compliance with\n\na challenged registration statute and the burden on the state of\n\ndemonstrating that the church is not a religious organization).\n\n                                     III.\n\n            We consider the constitutional standing issue to be a\n\nclose one. Plaintiffs here are better situated than those in Lujan\n\nv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 564 (1992), who argued the\n\ninjury could some day occur, or the plaintiff in Lyons, 461 U.S. at\n\n98,    who argued that, having been once placed in a choke hold by\n\npolice when arrested, he might well be again.          Within the Article\n\nIII standing cases, there is considerable language about not\n\nrecognizing   standing       where   \"hypothetical,\"   \"speculative,\"    or\n\n\"conjectural\" injury is at issue.           See, e.g., Lujan, 504 U.S. at\n\n560; Lyons, 461 U.S. at 101-02. Calling McInnis-Misenor's possible\n\ninjuries 'hypothetical' is, in a sense, inaccurate; it is clear\n\nalready what the nature of the claim is, the contours of the\n\nthreatened injury, that the injury would be traced to challenged\n\naction, and that the injury is redressable by a court.            See Valley\n\nForge, 454 U.S. at 471.\n\n            This is not a situation of a litigant \"pressing solely\n\nabstract concerns founded on ill-defined facts, creating a danger\n\nthat   a   judicial   pronouncement    would    constitute   a   prohibited\n\n'advisory opinion.'\"     1   Tribe, supra, § 3-14, at 388.       Plaintiffs'\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fconcern is not solely abstract, given her experiences at MMC in\n\n1999; nor are the facts ill-defined.\n\n           Nor is the standing issue in this case clearly resolved\n\nby the precedent set by the cases relied upon by MMC that reject\n\nclaims to standing to challenge restrictions on abortion based on\n\npotential pregnancy.   See Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 121 (1973);\n\nAbele v. Markle, 452 F.2d 1121, 1124-25 (2d Cir. 1971); Crossen v.\n\nBreckenridge, 446 F.2d 833, 839 (6th Cir. 1971); Akron Ctr. for\n\nReproductive Health v. Rosen, 633 F. Supp. 1123, 1128 (N.D. Ohio\n\n1986).   There is an important difference in the level of imminence\n\nbetween the risk of an unhoped-for and actively avoided pregnancy\n\n(which might or might not lead to seeking an abortion) and an\n\nactively sought-after and planned-for pregnancy.   It is, however,\n\nalso true that the time frame to obtain an abortion is shorter.   We\n\ndecline to embrace a per se rule barring all claims to standing\n\nbased on potential pregnancy whatever the nature of the cause of\n\naction. Given the difficulty of predicting all the possible claims\n\nthat might arise in the context of pregnancy, we cannot say that\n\nstanding can never be based on potential pregnancy.\n\n           In the end, we do not decide the more difficult question\n\nof whether constitutional standing is present, because we think the\n\ncase may be resolved based on the prudential aspects of the\n\nstanding and ripeness doctrines.      As noted above, ripeness and\n\nstanding overlap in many ways; for purposes of analysis here, the\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fcases dealing with ripeness present a closer fit.                  Both analyses\n\nare concerned with fitness for review and hardship.\n\nA.    Fitness\n\n            In several ways, this is a simple case, and arguably fit\n\nfor    determination.         The       legal     issues     are      relatively\n\nstraightforward.     Plaintiffs' complaint asserts, at paragraphs 22\n\nand 23:\n\n            Removal of the barrier in the Family Center to permit use\n            by Mrs. McInnis-Misenor and other people who use\n            wheelchairs would be readily achievable for MMC within\n            the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12181(9) and 5 M.R.S.A. § 4592\n            in light of:\n                   a.    The nature and cost of the barrier removal;\n                   b.    MMC's overall financial resources, number of\n                         employees and the effect of the barrier\n                         removal on MMC's expenses and resources; and\n                   c.    MMC's type of operation.\n            Unless Defendant removes the barriers in the Family\n            Center, Plaintiffs and other people who use wheelchairs\n            will continue to be excluded from the Family Center and\n            therefore   unable   to   enjoy   the  goods,   services,\n            facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations\n            provided to non-disabled persons who stay in and use the\n            Family Center.\n\nThe claims and defenses are well-presented by the Commission\n\nReport.\n\n            The   Commission's     Report     detailed     MMC's    position   on\n\nwhether   renovating    a   room   in   the     Family   Center    was   \"readily\n\nachievable\" under 42 U.S.C. § 12181(9).            The Report outlined MMC's\n\nrevenue for the fiscal year ended September 2000, its expenses, and\n\nits capital budget.         It specified that the estimated cost of\n\nrenovating a patient room and associated bath/shower room was\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f$62,000.    There would be additional costs from closing that room\n\nwhile    renovations     were   done.    If   money    was     spent   on   this\n\nrenovation, MMC said, it would have to postpone other ADA physical\n\nbarrier removals, such as a wheelchair ramp, or cut back elsewhere.\n\nMMC also noted that it is a relatively rare occurrence to have a\n\nwheelchair-using patient give birth, and there was not another such\n\npatient between November 1999 and March 2001.                   MMC took the\n\nposition   that   it    would   be   irrational   to   spend    the    money   as\n\nplaintiffs desired, as the labor and delivery unit has the lowest\n\nincidence of use by mobility-impaired patients of any of the in-\n\npatient units.4        The facts at issue are limited in number, and\n\neasily discoverable, and this suggests simplicity.\n\n            But this simplicity is not enough to create fitness.\n\nEven though the legal issues may be clear, a case may still not be\n\nfit for review:\n\n            [T]he question of fitness does not pivot solely on\n            whether a court is capable of resolving a claim\n            intelligently, but also involves an assessment of whether\n            it is appropriate for the court to undertake the task.\n            Federal courts cannot -- and should not -- spend their\n            scarce resources on what amounts to shadow boxing. Thus,\n            if a plaintiff's claim, though predominantly legal in\n            character, depends on future events that may never come\n            to pass, or that may not occur in the form forecasted,\n            then the claim is unripe.\n\nErnst & Young, 45 F.3d at 537.          \"[P]remature review not only can\n\ninvolve judges in deciding issues in a context not sufficiently\n\n\n     4\n          The Commission found that the Family Center renovations\nproposed by plaintiffs were not required by Maine law.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fconcrete to allow for focus and intelligent analysis, but it also\n\ncan involve them in deciding issues unnecessarily, wasting time and\n\neffort.\"    W.R. Grace & Co. v. United States EPA, 959 F.2d 360, 366\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).       Moreover, this is not a situation in which a\n\ndecision is \"unavoidable,\" as in Stern.             214 F.3d at 10.          Here,\n\nthat the future event may never come to pass augurs against a\n\nfinding of fitness.\n\n            The chain of contingencies lying between the plaintiffs'\n\ncurrent state and their complained-of future injury bolsters that\n\nconclusion.     Like the situation in Ernst & Young, the present case\n\nalso depends on a chain of contingencies.             In Ernst & Young, the\n\nthreatened injury was contingent upon a series of eight events\n\nwhich     may   or   may   not   come   to    pass,      \"a   long   string    of\n\ncontingencies,\" we found, \"so long that [Ernst & Young's] assertion\n\nof fitness for judicial review trips over it and falls.\"                45 F.3d\n\nat 538.\n\n            Similarly,     the   present     case   is    one   in   which    the\n\nthreatened injury is contingent on several events which may or may\n\nnot happen.      First -- as the magistrate judge recognized -- the\n\nkeystone is that McInnis-Misenor may or may not become pregnant.\n\nSecond, there is no way of knowing when, if ever, McInnis-Misenor\n\nwill become pregnant, and so there is no way of knowing whether MMC\n\nwill by then have Family Center facilities available to mothers in\n\nwheelchairs.     Other contingencies include: if she delivers at MMC\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f(as is likely) she may or may not be eligible for transfer to the\n\nFamily Center; her delivery may pose complications, as last time,\n\nwhich prevent her transfer; and there may or may not be room\n\navailable at the Family Center on the day she would want to\n\ntransfer. We do not suggest, however, that these latter conditions\n\nalone would defeat standing.\n\n           As in Ernst & Young, \"the case that [plaintiffs] argue []\n\nis, at this stage, largely hypothetical, and such cases are seldom\n\nfit for federal judicial review.\"      Id.\n\nB.   Hardship\n\n           We consider hardship as well.      The plaintiffs' weak\n\nshowing on the fitness prong means that they must compensate on the\n\nhardship prong.    The hardship analysis focuses on 'direct and\n\nimmediate' harm.   It is unconcerned with wholly contingent harm.\n\nW.R. Grace, 959 F.2d at 367.   The plaintiffs contend that they will\n\nsuffer hardship from withholding of a decision.     They argue that\n\nthey will be unable to present their claims in federal court, have\n\nthe claims heard, have the court grant them any relief to which they\n\nmay be entitled, and have the defendants comply with any remedial\n\norders, including the employment of necessary professionals such as\n\ncarpenters and architects to remove the barrier, all within the\n\nlimited term of a pregnancy.\n\n           We disagree with the plaintiffs' assessment of hardship.\n\nThere is every reason to think the district court could timely\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fresolve a case if McInnis-Misenor becomes pregnant and effectuate\n\na remedy.      The legal     issues presented by plaintiffs are not\n\ncomplicated.      Many of the facts are already presented, or can be\n\ndiscovered readily.         Discovery will concern the costs of the\n\narchitectural changes versus MMC's size and resources, matters all\n\ncapable of stipulation.       We predict trial, if any, would be short\n\nand   discovery    brief.      MMC   represented   that   litigation   and\n\nimplementation of any decision could be accomplished within the\n\nneeded time.      The magistrate judge expressed certainty that the\n\ntrial court could achieve speedy resolution and remedy, and there\n\nis no reason to doubt that confidence.5       We do not find sufficient\n\nhardship on the part of the plaintiffs to offset their weak showing\n\non the fitness prong.\n\n            In balancing these alternatives, we also must weigh the\n\nfact that McInnis-Misenor may never become pregnant, or she may not\n\ndeliver, or MMC may have a new facility by then and so that the\n\nclaimed injury may never come to pass.        The conditional nature of\n\nthe claims counseled in favor of the district court refusing to\n\nentertain jurisdiction at this point.       The prudential reasons alone\n\nprovide adequate basis to affirm the order dismissing the ADA claim\n\nwithout prejudice.\n\n\n      5\n          For the reasons discussed above, while this case        may be\ncapable of repetition, it would not evade review, because         of the\ndistrict court's ability to respond to a complaint in a           timely\nfashion.   This distinguishes the situation from that in          Roe v.\nWade, 410 U.S. at 125.\n\n                                     -18-\n\f                                  IV.\n\n          We review the dismissal of pendent state law claims for\n\nabuse of discretion.   United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715,\n\n728 (1966).   The plaintiffs' arguments that the district court\n\nshould not have dismissed the pendent state claims are without\n\nmerit. When federal claims are dismissed before trial, state claims\n\nare normally dismissed as well.    See Camelio v. Am. Fed'n, 137 F.3d\n\n666, 672 (1st Cir. 1998).   It is up to plaintiffs whether to file\n\ntheir state claims, as to past actions of the MMC in the 1999\n\ndelivery, in the state courts.\n\n                                   V.\n\n          The dismissal of the case is affirmed.   Costs are awarded\n\nto MMC.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f",

She and her husband are attempting to have a second child, but she is not yet pregnant. Anticipating that she will become pregnant, they brought suit in federal court in October 2001. The complaint, as amended in March 2002, alleged that the Maine Medical Center (\"MMC\") was in violation of the architectural barrier provisions of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12182 (2000), and the Maine Human Rights Act, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4592 (West 2002). They seek an injunction to force MMC &#8212; the nearest hospital that handles high risk deliveries (as hers would be) &#8212; to move walls in the Family Center to make the bathrooms wheelchair-accessible. The Family Center is an after-birth recovery area of rooms usually used, when available, by newly delivered mothers. If such rooms are not available, the mothers remain in the newer Birth Center rooms, in a different wing of MMC, where the delivery actually takes place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McInnis-Misenor has reason for concern about her access to the Family Center. She gave birth to her first child at MMC in November 1999. At that time, MMC spent $5,300 to reconfigure a private room in the Birth Center to make it available to her. Due to complications associated with her giving birth, she was unable to transfer to the Family Center and remained in the Birth Center for the duration of her recovery. Even if she had not suffered those complications, moving her to the Family Center was not a viable option because no room in that wing had toilet and shower facilities configured to be wheelchair-accessible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2000, McInnis-Misenor filed a complaint with the Maine Human Rights Commission alleging violations of the Maine Human Rights Act, based on her November 1999 experience. The Commission investigated and issued a report, which we shall refer to later, and which the district court considered. Among the claims made to the Commission was that MMC failed to remove architectural barriers in the Family Center.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A magistrate judge, acting on MMC's Rule 12(b)(6) motion, recommended that the action be dismissed because the plaintiffs did not at present have standing to bring their claims. <i>McInnis-Misenor v. Me. Med. Ctr.,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d 256, 257 (D.Me.2002). The district judge agreed and dismissed the action, without prejudice, on July 30, 2002.

Spear,</i> 520 U.S. 154, 167-68, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997). The plaintiffs initially argue that the district court erred in not taking all factual inferences from the complaint in their favor, as is required on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. The argument is misplaced. We and the district court both have assumed it to be true that McInnis-Misenor is disabled, that plaintiffs are attempting to have another child, that they will use MMC (a place of public accommodation) for any delivery, and that at present the Family Center cannot accommodate her. But Rule 12(b)(6) does not require we make the inferences necessary to establish that there is federal jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Standing: Constitutional and Prudential</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts are confined by Article III of the Constitution to deciding only actual cases or controversies. <i>Allen v.

Standing is thus a threshold question in every case, requiring the court to determine \"whether the plaintiff has `alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy' as to warrant [ ] invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.\" <i>See Warth,</i> 422 U.S. at 498-99, 95 S.Ct. 2197 (quoting <i>Baker v.

A litigant bears the burden of showing \"that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant, and that the injury fairly can be traced to the challenged action and is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\" <i>See Valley Forge Christian Coll. v.

Federal courts have identified a number of prudential concerns regarding the proper exercise of federal jurisdiction. Three of these areas are well-established: (1) the complaint must \"fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked\"; (2) the plaintiff \"must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties\"; and (3) the suit must present more than \"abstract questions of wide public significance which amount to generalized grievances, pervasively shared and most appropriately addressed in the representative branches.\" <i>N.H.

We start with the language of the ADA. The enforcement provisions of Title III of the ADA are set forth in &#167; 308, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remedies and procedures set forth in section 204(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.2000a-3(a)) are the remedies and procedures this title provides to any person who is being subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of this title or who has reasonable grounds for believing that such person is about to be subjected to discrimination in violation of section 303. Nothing in this section shall require a person with a disability to engage in a futile gesture if such person has actual notice that a person or organization covered by this title does not intend to comply with its provisions. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12188(a)(1). McInnis-Misenor is not \"being subjected to discrimination,\" so her claim must rest on whether she \"has reasonable grounds for believing [she] is about to be subjected to discrimination.\" The statutory language \"about to be subjected to discrimination\" dovetails with the usual prudential analysis as to whether McInnis-Misenor's claims are too contingent and premature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McInnis-Misenor cites some ADA cases to us, all factually distinguishable. This is not, for example, a case in which the existence of architectural barriers is the only reason the ADA plaintiff has not returned for services. <i>E.g., Parr v. L&amp;L Drive-Inn Rest.,</i> 96 F.Supp.2d 1065, 1079-80 (D.Hawai`i 2000) (finding standing for a plaintiff prevented from using fast food chain restaurant due to various architectural barriers because of his sincere intent to return as evidenced by his past patronage and taste for the chain's food).

The overlap is most apparent in cases that deny standing because an anticipated injury is too remote, for example. 13A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 3531.12, at 51. Ripeness, standing, and mootness<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> are closely linked:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ripeness and mootness easily could be seen as the time dimensions of standing. Each assumes that an asserted injury would be adequate; ripeness then asks whether an injury that has not yet happened is sufficiently likely to happen, and mootness asks whether an injury that has happened is too far beyond a useful remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 50. Ripeness, however, can be thought of as focusing on the \"when\" of litigation, as opposed to the \"who.\" <i>See</i> E. Chemerinsky, <i>Federal Jurisdiction</i> &#167; 2.4.1, at 114 (3d ed. 1999). Even if plaintiffs were the appropriate \"who,\" the question of \"when\" remains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The test to be applied in ripeness analysis is whether \"there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\" <i>Lake Carriers' Ass'n v. MacMullan,</i> 406 U.S. 498, 506, 92 S.Ct. 1749, 32 L.Ed.2d 257 (1972). The ripeness doctrine seeks \"to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.\" <i>Abbott Labs. v. Gardner,</i> 387 U.S. 136, 148, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967). Determining ripeness involves a dual inquiry: evaluation of \"both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\" <i>Id.</i> at 149, 87 S.Ct. 1507. Both prongs of the test must be satisfied, although a strong showing on one may compensate for a weak one on the other. <i>See Ernst &amp; Young v. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp.,</i> 45 F.3d 530, 535 (1st Cir.1995). Like standing, ripeness has both constitutional and prudential elements. <i>See Reno v. Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc.,</i> 509 U.S. 43, 58 n. 18, 113 S.Ct. 2485, 125 L.Ed.2d 38 (1993); 13A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 3532.1, at 118.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fitness inquiry, both constitutional and prudential concerns operate, with prudential concerns focusing on the policy of judicial restraint from unnecessary decisions. The fitness inquiry \"typically involves subsidiary queries concerning finality, definiteness, and the extent to which resolution of the challenge depends on facts that may not yet be sufficiently developed.\" <i>Stern v. U.S. Dist. Court,</i> 214 F.3d 4, 10 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> 45 F.3d at 535). \"The critical question concerning fitness for review is whether the claim involves uncertain and contingent events that may not occur as anticipated or may not occur at all.\" <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> 45 F.3d at 536 (quoting <i>Mass. Ass'n of Afro-Am. Police, Inc. v. Boston Police Dep't,</i> 973 F.2d 18, 20 (1st Cir.1992)). The fact that an event has not occurred can be counterbalanced in this analysis by the fact that a case turns on legal issues \"not likely to be significantly affected by further factual development.\" <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> 45 F.3d at 536.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong &#8212; hardship &#8212; is entirely prudential. The hardship prong evaluates \"the extent to which withholding judgment will impose hardship &#8212; an inquiry that typically turns upon whether the challenged action creates a `direct and immediate' dilemma for the parties.\" <i>Stern,</i> 214 F.3d at 10 (quoting <i>Abbott Labs.,</i> 387 U.S. at 152, 87 S.Ct. 1507). The greater the hardship, the more likely a court will be to find ripeness. <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> 45 F.3d at 536. This inquiry encompasses the question of whether plaintiff is suffering any present injury from a future contemplated event. <i>See Reg'l Rail Reorganiz. Act Cases,</i> 419 U.S. 102, 143 n. 29, 95 S.Ct. 335, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974); 1 L. Tribe, <i>American Constitutional Law</i> &#167; 3-10, at 337 (3d ed. 2000); <i>see also Larson v. Valente,</i> 456 U.S. 228, 242-43, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982) (assessing under standing both the injury to the church from compliance with a challenged registration statute and the burden on the state of demonstrating that the church is not a religious organization).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider the constitutional standing issue to be a close one. Plaintiffs here are better situated than those in <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 564, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992), who argued the injury could some day occur, or the plaintiff in <i>Lyons,</i> 461 U.S. at 98, 103 S.Ct. 1660, who argued that, having been once placed in a choke hold by police when arrested, he might well be again. Within the Article III standing cases, there is considerable language about not recognizing standing where \"hypothetical,\" \"speculative,\" or \"conjectural\" injury is at issue. <i>See, e.g., Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130; <i>Lyons,</i> 461 U.S. at 101-02, 103 S.Ct. 1660. Calling McInnis-Misenor's possible injuries `hypothetical' is, in a sense, inaccurate; it is clear already what the nature of the claim is, the contours of the threatened injury, that the injury would be traced to challenged action, and that the injury is redressable by a court. <i>See Valley Forge,</i> 454 U.S. at 471, 102 S.Ct. 752.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a situation of a litigant \"pressing solely abstract concerns founded on ill-defined facts, creating a danger that a judicial pronouncement would constitute a prohibited `advisory opinion.'\" 1 Tribe, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 3-14, at 388. Plaintiffs' concern is not solely abstract, given her experiences at MMC in 1999; nor are the facts ill-defined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is the standing issue in this case clearly resolved by the precedent set by the cases relied upon by MMC that reject claims to standing to challenge restrictions on abortion based on potential pregnancy. <i>See Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 121, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973); <i>Abele v. Markle,</i> 452 F.2d 1121, 1124-25 (2d Cir.1971); <i>Crossen v. Breckenridge,</i> 446 F.2d 833, 839 (6th Cir.1971); <i>Akron Ctr. for Reproductive Health v. Rosen,</i> 633 F.Supp. 1123, 1128 (N.D.Ohio 1986). There is an important difference in the level of imminence between the risk of an unhoped-for and actively avoided pregnancy (which might or might not lead to seeking an abortion) and an actively sought-after and planned-for pregnancy. It is, however, also true that the time frame to obtain an abortion is shorter. We decline to embrace a per se rule barring all claims to standing based on potential pregnancy whatever the nature of the cause of action. Given the difficulty of predicting all the possible claims that might arise in the context of pregnancy, we cannot say that standing can never be based on potential pregnancy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we do not decide the more difficult question of whether constitutional standing is present, because we think the case may be resolved based on the prudential aspects of the standing and ripeness doctrines. As noted above, ripeness and standing overlap in many ways; for purposes of analysis here, the cases dealing with ripeness present a closer fit. Both analyses are concerned with fitness for review and hardship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Fitness</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In several ways, this is a simple case, and arguably fit for determination. The legal issues are relatively straightforward. Plaintiffs' complaint asserts, at paragraphs 22 and 23:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Removal of the barrier in the Family Center to permit use by Mrs. McInnis-Misenor and other people who use wheelchairs would be readily achievable for MMC within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12181(9) and 5 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4592 in light of:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. The nature and cost of the barrier removal;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

The Report outlined MMC's revenue for the fiscal year ended September 2000, its expenses, and its capital budget. It specified that the estimated cost of renovating a patient room and associated bath/shower room was $62,000. There would be additional costs from closing that room while renovations were done. If money was spent on this renovation, MMC said, it would have to postpone other ADA physical barrier removals, such as a wheelchair ramp, or cut back elsewhere. MMC also noted that it is a relatively rare occurrence to have a wheelchair-using patient give birth, and there was not another such patient between November 1999 and March 2001. MMC took the position that it would be irrational to spend the money as plaintiffs desired, as the labor and delivery unit has the lowest incidence of use by mobility-impaired patients of any of the in-patient units.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The facts at issue are limited in number, and easily discoverable, and this suggests simplicity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this simplicity is not enough to create fitness. Even though the legal issues may be clear, a case may still not be fit for review:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he question of fitness does not pivot solely on whether a court is capable of resolving a claim intelligently, but also involves an assessment of whether it is appropriate for the court to undertake the task. Federal courts cannot &#8212; and should not &#8212; spend their scarce resources on what amounts to shadow boxing. Thus, if a plaintiff's claim, though predominantly legal in character, depends on future events that may never come to pass, or that may not occur in the form forecasted, then the claim is unripe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> 45 F.3d at 537. \"[P]remature review not only can involve judges in deciding issues in a context not sufficiently concrete to allow for focus and intelligent analysis, but it also can involve them in deciding issues unnecessarily, wasting time and effort.\" <i>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. United States EPA,</i> 959 F.2d 360, 366 (1st Cir.1992). Moreover, this is not a situation in which a decision is \"unavoidable,\" as in <i>Stern.</i> 214 F.3d at 10. Here, that the future event may never come to pass augurs against a finding of fitness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chain of contingencies lying between the plaintiffs' current state and their complained-of future injury bolsters that conclusion. Like the situation in <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> the present case also depends on a chain of contingencies. In <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> the threatened injury was contingent upon a series of eight events which may or may not come to pass, \"a long string of contingencies,\" we found, \"so long that [Ernst &amp; Young's] assertion of fitness for judicial review trips over it and falls.\" 45 F.3d at 538.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the present case is one in which the threatened injury is contingent on several events which may or may not happen. First &#8212; as the magistrate judge recognized &#8212; the keystone is that McInnis-Misenor may or may not become pregnant. Second, there is no way of knowing when, if ever, McInnis-Misenor will become pregnant, and so there is no way of knowing whether MMC will by then have Family Center facilities available to mothers in wheelchairs. Other contingencies include: if she delivers at MMC (as is likely) she may or may not be eligible for transfer to the Family Center; her delivery may pose complications, as last time, which prevent her transfer; and there may or may not be room available at the Family Center on the day she would want to transfer. We do not suggest, however, that these latter conditions alone would defeat standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> \"the case that [plaintiffs] argue [ ] is, at this stage, largely hypothetical, and such cases are seldom fit for federal judicial review.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Hardship</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider hardship as well. The plaintiffs' weak showing on the fitness prong means that they must compensate on the hardship prong. The hardship analysis focuses on `direct and immediate' harm. It is unconcerned with wholly contingent harm. <i>W.R. Grace,</i> 959 F.2d at 367. The plaintiffs contend that they will suffer hardship from withholding of a decision. They argue that they will be unable to present their claims in federal court, have the claims heard, have the court grant them any relief to which they may be entitled, and have the defendants comply with any remedial orders, including the employment of necessary professionals such as carpenters and architects to remove the barrier, all within the limited term of a pregnancy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the plaintiffs' assessment of hardship. There is every reason to think the district court could timely resolve a case if McInnis-Misenor becomes pregnant and effectuate a remedy. The legal issues presented by plaintiffs are not complicated. Many of the facts are already presented, or can be discovered readily. Discovery will concern the costs of the architectural changes versus MMC's size and resources, matters all capable of stipulation. We predict trial, if any, would be short and discovery brief. MMC represented that litigation and implementation of any decision could be accomplished within the needed time. The magistrate judge expressed certainty that the trial court could achieve speedy resolution and remedy, and there is no reason to doubt that confidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We do not find sufficient hardship on the part of the plaintiffs to offset their weak showing on the fitness prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In balancing these alternatives, we also must weigh the fact that McInnis-Misenor may never become pregnant, or she may not deliver, or MMC may have a new facility by then and so that the claimed injury may never come to pass. The conditional nature of the claims counseled in favor of the district court refusing to entertain jurisdiction at this point. The prudential reasons alone provide adequate basis to affirm the order dismissing the ADA claim without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the dismissal of pendent state law claims for abuse of discretion. <i>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs,</i> 383 U.S. 715, 728, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). The plaintiffs' arguments that the district court should not have dismissed the pendent state claims are without merit. When federal claims are dismissed before trial, state claims are normally dismissed as well. <i>See Camelio v. Am. Fed'n,</i> 137 F.3d 666, 672 (1st Cir.1998).

Pac. Terminal Co. v. ICC,</i> 219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911). Because some injuries occur and are over so quickly that they will always be moot before federal litigation is complete, such injuries are deemed an exception to the ordinary mootness doctrine. <i>See</i> E.

She and her husband are attempting to have a second child, but she is not yet pregnant. Anticipating that she will become pregnant, they brought suit in federal court in October 2001. The complaint, as amended in March 2002, alleged that the Maine Medical Center (\"MMC\") was in violation of the architectural barrier provisions of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12182 (2000), and the Maine Human Rights Act, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4592 (West 2002). They seek an injunction to force MMC &#8212; the nearest hospital that handles high risk deliveries (as hers would be) &#8212; to move walls in the Family Center to make the bathrooms wheelchair-accessible. The Family Center is an after-birth recovery area of rooms usually used, when available, by newly delivered mothers. If such rooms are not available, the mothers remain in the newer Birth Center rooms, in a different wing of MMC, where the delivery actually takes place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McInnis-Misenor has reason for concern about her access to the Family Center. She gave birth to her first child at MMC in November 1999. At that time, MMC spent $5,300 to reconfigure a private room in the Birth Center to make it available to her. Due to complications associated with her giving birth, she was unable to transfer to the Family Center and remained in the Birth Center for the duration of her recovery. Even if she had not suffered those complications, moving her to the Family Center was not a viable option because no room in that wing had toilet and shower facilities configured to be wheelchair-accessible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2000, McInnis-Misenor filed a complaint with the Maine Human Rights Commission alleging violations of the Maine Human Rights Act, based on her November 1999 experience. The Commission investigated and issued a report, which we shall refer to later, and which the district court considered. Among the claims made to the Commission was that MMC failed to remove architectural barriers in the Family Center.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A magistrate judge, acting on MMC's Rule 12(b)(6) motion, recommended that the action be dismissed because the plaintiffs did not at present have standing to bring their claims. <i>McInnis-Misenor v.

The plaintiffs initially argue that the district court erred in not taking all factual inferences from the complaint in their favor, as is required on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. The argument is misplaced. We and the district court both have assumed it to be true that McInnis-Misenor is disabled, that plaintiffs are attempting to have another child, that they will use MMC (a place of public accommodation) for any delivery, and that at present the Family Center cannot accommodate her. But Rule 12(b)(6) does not require we make the inferences necessary to establish that there is federal jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Standing: Constitutional and Prudential</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts are confined by Article III of the Constitution to deciding only actual cases or controversies. <i>Allen v.

It is, however, also true that the time frame to obtain an abortion is shorter. We decline to embrace a per se rule barring all claims to standing based on potential pregnancy whatever the nature of the cause of action.

The Report outlined MMC's revenue for the fiscal year ended September 2000, its expenses, and its capital budget. It specified that the estimated cost of renovating a patient room and associated bath/shower room was $62,000. There would be additional costs from closing that room while renovations were done. If money was spent on this renovation, MMC said, it would have to postpone other ADA physical barrier removals, such as a wheelchair ramp, or cut back elsewhere. MMC also noted that it is a relatively rare occurrence to have a wheelchair-using patient give birth, and there was not another such patient between November 1999 and March 2001. MMC took the position that it would be irrational to spend the money as plaintiffs desired, as the labor and delivery unit has the lowest incidence of use by mobility-impaired patients of any of the in-patient units.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The facts at issue are limited in number, and easily discoverable, and this suggests simplicity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this simplicity is not enough to create fitness.

Federal courts cannot &#8212; and should not &#8212; spend their scarce resources on what amounts to shadow boxing. Thus, if a plaintiff's claim, though predominantly legal in character, depends on future events that may never come to pass, or that may not occur in the form forecasted, then the claim is unripe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> 45 F.3d at 537. \"[P]remature review not only can involve judges in deciding issues in a context not sufficiently concrete to allow for focus and intelligent analysis, but it also can involve them in deciding issues unnecessarily, wasting time and effort.\" <i>W.R.

Moreover, this is not a situation in which a decision is \"unavoidable,\" as in <i>Stern.</i> 214 F.3d at 10.

Like the situation in <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> the present case also depends on a chain of contingencies. In <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> the threatened injury was contingent upon a series of eight events which may or may not come to pass, \"a long string of contingencies,\" we found, \"so long that [Ernst &amp; Young's] assertion of fitness for judicial review trips over it and falls.\" 45 F.3d at 538.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the present case is one in which the threatened injury is contingent on several events which may or may not happen. First &#8212; as the magistrate judge recognized &#8212; the keystone is that McInnis-Misenor may or may not become pregnant. Second, there is no way of knowing when, if ever, McInnis-Misenor will become pregnant, and so there is no way of knowing whether MMC will by then have Family Center facilities available to mothers in wheelchairs. Other contingencies include: if she delivers at MMC (as is likely) she may or may not be eligible for transfer to the Family Center; her delivery may pose complications, as last time, which prevent her transfer; and there may or may not be room available at the Family Center on the day she would want to transfer. We do not suggest, however, that these latter conditions alone would defeat standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in <i>Ernst &amp; Young,</i> \"the case that [plaintiffs] argue [ ] is, at this stage, largely hypothetical, and such cases are seldom fit for federal judicial review.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Hardship</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider hardship as well. The plaintiffs' weak showing on the fitness prong means that they must compensate on the hardship prong. The hardship analysis focuses on `direct and immediate' harm.

They argue that they will be unable to present their claims in federal court, have the claims heard, have the court grant them any relief to which they may be entitled, and have the defendants comply with any remedial orders, including the employment of necessary professionals such as carpenters and architects to remove the barrier, all within the limited term of a pregnancy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the plaintiffs' assessment of hardship. There is every reason to think the district court could timely resolve a case if McInnis-Misenor becomes pregnant and effectuate a remedy. The legal issues presented by plaintiffs are not complicated. Many of the facts are already presented, or can be discovered readily. Discovery will concern the costs of the architectural changes versus MMC's size and resources, matters all capable of stipulation. We predict trial, if any, would be short and discovery brief. MMC represented that litigation and implementation of any decision could be accomplished within the needed time. The magistrate judge expressed certainty that the trial court could achieve speedy resolution and remedy, and there is no reason to doubt that confidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We do not find sufficient hardship on the part of the plaintiffs to offset their weak showing on the fitness prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In balancing these alternatives, we also must weigh the fact that McInnis-Misenor may never become pregnant, or she may not deliver, or MMC may have a new facility by then and so that the claimed injury may never come to pass. The conditional nature of the claims counseled in favor of the district court refusing to entertain jurisdiction at this point. The prudential reasons alone provide adequate basis to affirm the order dismissing the ADA claim without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the dismissal of pendent state law claims for abuse of discretion. <i>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107200\"><a href=\"/opinion/107200/mine-workers-v-gibbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 728, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107200\"><a href=\"/opinion/107200/mine-workers-v-gibbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span> (1966). The plaintiffs' arguments that the district court should not have dismissed the pendent state claims are without merit. When federal claims are dismissed before trial, state claims are normally dismissed as well. <i>See Camelio v. Am. Fed'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751836\"><a href=\"/opinion/751836/augustus-john-camelio-v-american-federation-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span>, 672 (1st Cir.1998). It is up to plaintiffs whether to file their state claims, as to past actions of the MMC in the 1999 delivery, in the state courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dismissal of the case is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to MMC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Commission Report is an official public record and for that reason could be considered by the court in deciding a Rule (12)(b)(6) motion<i>See Alternative Energy, Inc. v.

Further, as a factual matter, a claim based on the 1999 events suffers from a causation problem: she was too sick to move to the Family Center in any case. As a result, it is only the prospect of<i>future</i> injury which is at issue here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> While mootness in general is irrelevant to the case at hand &#8212; as McInnis-Misenor complains of future injuries, not past ones &#8212; an interest protected by one aspect of mootness analysis might be thought to be pertinent here: the \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" exception<i>See S. Pac. Terminal Co. v. ICC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97365\"><a href=\"/opinion/97365/so-pac-terminal-co-v-int-comm-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, 515, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></span> (1911). Because some injuries occur and are over so quickly that they will always be moot before federal litigation is complete, such injuries are deemed an exception to the ordinary mootness doctrine. <i>See</i> E. Chemerinsky, <i>Federal Jurisdiction</i> &#167; 2.5.3, at 132 (3d ed. 1999).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Commission found that the Family Center renovations proposed by plaintiffs were not required by Maine law</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> For the reasons discussed above, while this case may be capable of repetition, it would not evade review, because of the district court's ability to respond to a complaint in a timely fashion.
