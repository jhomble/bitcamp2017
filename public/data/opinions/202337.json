Gene Carter, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                 Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n               and Stafford,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Michelle Allot, with whom Daniel Bates, John Lemieux, and\nFarris Law were on brief, for appellant.\n     Lawrence C. Winger for appellee.\n     Stephanie E.F. Jazlowiecki, with whom Jeffrey Neil Young,\nMcTeague, Higbee, Case, Cohen, Whitney & Toker, P.A., Zachary L.\nHeiden, and Maine Civil Liberties Union Foundation, were on brief,\nfor Maine Civil Liberties Union Foundation, amicus curiae.\n\n\n                           August 3, 2006\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of   the   Northern   District    of   Florida,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge. A federal jury in Maine found that\n\nAbdul Azimi, a Muslim immigrant from Afghanistan, had suffered\n\nracial, religious, or ethnic harassment at his former workplace,\n\nJordan's Meats, Inc., in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and Title\n\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.\n\n          The jury did not find that Azimi had suffered any harm\n\nfor which it would award compensatory damages.      Azimi had put on no\n\nevidence of any out-of-pocket costs he had incurred for medical\n\ntreatment or psychological counseling, or of any wages lost as a\n\nresult of the abuse he suffered at his workplace; instead, he\n\nrelied only on his own testimony and the testimony of his wife and\n\na friend about his emotional distress -- testimony that the jury\n\nreasonably rejected as a basis for awarding compensatory damages.\n\n          On   appeal,   Azimi,   supported   by   amicus   Maine   Civil\n\nLiberties Union Foundation (MCLUF), advances the argument that, as\n\na matter of law, a finding of a hostile work environment requires\n\nthat there be an award of compensatory damages, even if a jury has\n\nrejected plaintiff's causation-of-damages evidence.         This argument\n\nwas long ago rejected by the Supreme Court.\n\n          Azimi also did not receive nominal damages.            That is\n\nbecause he did not ask for them in a timely fashion; he chose not\n\nto submit the question of nominal damages to the jury, and he\n\nwaited far too long to request them from the district court.          He\n\nthus has forfeited the issue.       Azimi now asserts that nominal\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fdamages must be awarded as a matter of law even if nominal damages\n\nwere not timely requested.        We reject the argument.\n\n            Because    Azimi   had   not   been    awarded     back   pay,   or\n\ncompensatory damages, or nominal damages, the law of this circuit,\n\nat least with respect to his Title VII claim, is that he could not\n\nreceive   punitive     damages.      Although    Azimi   now   wishes   us    to\n\nreconsider that rule, he failed to timely raise this issue with the\n\ntrial court.   Further, as to both his Title VII and § 1981 claims,\n\nhe did not object to the jury instruction on punitive damages or to\n\nthe special verdict form, both of which stated that punitive\n\ndamages could not be awarded if compensatory damages were not.\n\nIndeed, his argument that punitive damages ought not be contingent\n\non compensatory damages was not made until his motion for a new\n\ntrial, which was denied by the district court.\n\n            Azimi now asks that we hold that in § 1981 cases,\n\nwhatever the rule in Title VII cases, there is no prerequisite that\n\nthere be nominal or compensatory damages before punitive damages\n\nmay be granted.       We decline to reach the issue; it, too, was not\n\npreserved.\n\n            Finally, Azimi contends that the district court erred in\n\nentering summary judgment for Jordan's Meats on Azimi's unlawful\n\ndischarge    claims.     Azimi    had   argued    that   his   discharge     was\n\ndiscriminatory and that it was also in retaliation for his earlier\n\ncomplaints to the Maine Human Rights Commission (MHRC).                      The\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdistrict court found that Azimi had produced no evidence of pretext\n\ncountering Jordan's Meats' explanation that it terminated Azimi's\n\nemployment because he engaged in serious misconduct, including\n\nthreatening a female co-worker in a dark parking lot.              We affirm\n\nthe   district   court's   judgment      in   all   respects.      This   case\n\npotentially raised a number of serious issues; none were preserved\n\nfor appeal.\n\n           Where appropriate, we recite the facts in the light most\n\nfavorable to the jury's verdict, Torres-Rivera v. O'Neill-Cancel,\n\n406 F.3d 43, 45 (1st Cir. 2005), and discuss the pertinent facts\n\nwith the issues raised.\n\n                                    I.\n\nA.         Azimi's Claim for Compensatory Damages\n\n           Azimi   was   employed   at    the   Jordan's   Meats    plant   in\n\nPortland, Maine, from November 1999 to November 2001.              During the\n\nperiod Azimi was employed, the company had about 150 full-time\n\nemployees.    Azimi worked in various positions while at the plant,\n\nincluding as a meat slicer and a meat stripper.            At trial, Azimi\n\ntestified that he had been the subject of discriminatory treatment\n\nand abusive and harassing behavior by some of his former co-workers\n\nand supervisors.     The incidents of maltreatment are myriad and\n\noutrageous; we recite only a few examples.\n\n           On multiple occasions, one of Azimi's line leaders, Steve\n\nMitton, physically obstructed the hot water tap so as to prevent\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fAzimi from washing his hands, which were swollen from handling\n\nfrozen meat.   While Azimi was only allowed access to the cold water\n\ntap, Mitton permitted other, white employees to use the hot water.\n\n          Subsequently,    Azimi     was   transferred   to     another\n\ndepartment.    There, a co-worker, George Libby, made numerous\n\ndisparaging comments to Azimi about his religion, including: \"If\n\nyou eat pork and pussy, you become strong like me.\"       When Azimi\n\ntold Libby that both oral sex and the consumption of pork were\n\nagainst his religion, Libby said, \"fuck you and fuck your God; fuck\n\nyour religion.\" On separate occasions, Libby, whom Azimi described\n\nas weighing about three hundred pounds, also grabbed Azimi by the\n\nneck and tried to shove pork into Azimi's mouth; held Azimi by the\n\nwaist and pumped him from behind, simulating sexual intercourse;\n\nand told Azimi to \"suck my dick\" and, when Azimi took umbrage at\n\nthe comment, picked Azimi up and dangled him, off the floor, by his\n\narms, while other co-workers watched and laughed.             Libby and\n\nanother co-worker, Phil Ryan, also called Azimi on one of the\n\nphones in the plant and said to him, among other things, \"Nigger,\n\nSudan [sic] Hussein is waiting for you.\"\n\n          In addition to a number of other instances of verbal\n\nabuse and maltreatment by co-workers, Azimi was also subject to\n\nother offensive conduct, often by anonymous perpetrators.           For\n\nexample, he received an unsigned note in his locker; on one side of\n\nthe note was scrawled a swastika and on the other side was written:\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f          Hey MotherFucker Why don't You GO BACK to your\n          Own Country.\n\n          You don't bE long HERE you Fucking musselum\n          You PIECE of Shit WE HATE YOU\n          ALL ThE MUSSELUMS\n\n          You Don't don't bElong here AT JORDANSMEAT.\n\n          YOUR NOTHing but a Fucking NIGGER . . . .\n\nAzimi also once found pieces of pork in the pockets of his work\n\njacket; found a picture in his locker of Osama Bin Laden, on which\n\nwas written the words \"Abdul,\" \"Mother Fucker,\" and \"Your Dad need\n\n[sic] Help\"; and discovered that his goggles and hearing-protection\n\nequipment were smashed to pieces, and that his personal shoes had\n\nbeen taken from his work locker and stuck in the toilet.\n\n          Azimi testified that he reported the harassment to his\n\nsupervisors; that Brian Smith, the Human Resources Manager, and\n\nother supervisors failed to adequately investigate the incidents\n\nand to impose appropriate punishment on the wrongdoers; and that\n\nthe   harassment   continued   despite   his   complaints   and   his\n\nsupervisors' promises to address them.\n\n          After hearing the evidence, the jury found, by way of a\n\nspecial verdict form, that Azimi \"was subjected to an offensive\n\nwork environment that was hostile to his race, religion[,] or\n\nethnic origin,\" and that Jordan's Meats \"knew or should have known\n\nof the offensive hostile work environment and failed to take\n\nadequate and effective remedial measures.\"       The jury, however,\n\nanswered \"no\" to the question of whether \"Defendant Jordan's Meats,\n\n                                -6-\n\fInc.'s unlawful harassment legally caused [Azimi] to be damaged by\n\nemotional distress, pain, suffering, emotional anguish, loss of\n\nenjoyment of life[,] and/or inconvenience.\"1   As a result of this\n\n\n     1\n           The special verdict form and the jury's answers read as\nfollows:\n\n          1. Has Plaintiff, Abdul Azimi, proven by a\n     preponderance of evidence that he was subjected to an\n     offensive work environment that was hostile to his race,\n     religion or ethnic origin?\n\n     Yes   X    No\n\n     [If you answered Question 1 \"YES,\" go on to Question 2.\n     If you answered Question 1 \"NO,\" then answer no further\n     questions.]\n\n          2. Has Plaintiff, Abdul Azimi, proven by a\n     preponderance of evidence that Defendant, Jordan['s]\n     Meats, Inc., knew or should have known of the offensive\n     hostile work environment and failed to take adequate and\n     effective remedial measures?\n\n     Yes   X    No\n\n     [If you answered Question 2 \"YES,\" go on to Question 3.\n     If you answered Question 2 \"NO,\" then answer no further\n     questions.]\n\n          3.    Has Plaintiff, Abdul Azimi, proven by a\n     preponderance of evidence that Defendant Jordan's Meats,\n     Inc.'s unlawful harassment legally caused Plaintiff to be\n     damaged by emotional distress, pain, suffering, emotional\n     anguish, loss of enjoyment of life and/or inconvenience?\n\n     Yes        No   X\n\n     [If you answered Question 3 \"YES,\" go on to Question 4.\n     If you answered Question 3 \"NO,\" then answer no further\n     questions.]\n\n          4.   What amount is Plaintiff entitled to recover\n     from Defendant as compensation for those damages found in\n     answer to Question 3?\n\n                                -7-\n\ffinding, the jury followed the district court's instructions and\n\nthe special verdict form, and did not go on to consider what amount\n\nAzimi was entitled to recover as compensation for any injuries\n\nsuffered. There were no objections to the special verdict form and\n\nthe jury instructions, a point that we analyze later.\n\n           On appeal, Azimi's contention is that the jury was\n\nrequired to award compensatory damages, either as a matter of law\n\nor because the evidence compelled it.\n\n           Azimi, supported by the MCLUF, first argues that inherent\n\nin a finding of a hostile work environment is a finding that the\n\nclaimant suffered damages, such that any liability finding must be\n\n\n\n\n                               ($     . )\n     [Write out in words]      [Figures]\n\n     [Answer question 5.]\n\n          5.    Has Plaintiff, Abdul Azimi, proven by a\n     preponderance of evidence that Defendant's supervisory or\n     managerial personnel acted with malice or with reckless\n     indifference to Plaintiff's federally protected right to\n     be free from unlawful discrimination?\n\n     Yes        No\n\n     [If you answered Question 5 \"YES,\" then answer\n     Question 6. If you answered Question 5 \"NO,\" then answer\n     no further questions.]\n\n          6.   What amount of punitive damages should be\n     awarded to Plaintiff?\n\n                               ($     . )\n     [Write out in words]      [Figures]\n\n                                -8-\n\faccompanied by an award of compensatory damages.2              Azimi and amicus\n\npresent the issue as one of inconsistency in the jury verdict.\n\nThey also argue that the importance of the interests at stake\n\nrequires that there be an award of damages.\n\n            Both arguments have been repudiated by the Supreme Court.\n\nIndeed,    in   Carey   v.   Piphus,     435   U.S.   247    (1978),   the     Court\n\nrejected, in the context of a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the\n\narguments (1) that injury should be presumed from the violation of\n\na constitutional right and (2) that damages should be awarded for\n\na deprivation of a constitutional right regardless of whether any\n\ninjury    was   caused.      See   id.   at    254.    The    Court    noted   that\n\n\"[r]ights, constitutional and otherwise, do not exist in a vacuum,\"\n\nand that \"[t]heir purpose is to protect persons from injuries to\n\nparticular interests,\" such that without proof of injury, no\n\ncompensatory damages are possible.             Id. (emphasis added); see also\n\nMemphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 307 (1986)\n\n\n\n     2\n          This argument is predicated on the fact that to establish\na case of hostile work environment under Title VII, a plaintiff\nmust demonstrate, inter alia,\"that the work environment was 'both\nobjectively and subjectively offensive, one that a reasonable\nperson would find hostile or abusive, and one that [the plaintiff]\nin fact did perceive to be so.'\" Conto v. Concord Hosp., Inc., 265\nF.3d 79, 82 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Faragher v. City of Boca\nRaton, 524 U.S. 775, 787 (1998)). Amicus argues that \"[i]t cannot\nbe possible that the Jordan's Meats workplace was both objectively\nand subjectively offensive such that a reasonable person would find\nit hostile or abusive, and that Mr. Azimi in fact did perceive [it\nto] be so, and yet Mr. Azimi sustained no injury from that\nexperience.\"\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f(noting     that    compensatory         damages     must        be     \"grounded     in\n\ndeterminations of plaintiffs' actual losses\"); Carey, 435 U.S. at\n\n264   (\"[W]e    hold     that    neither   the   likelihood           of   [mental   and\n\nemotional] injury nor the difficulty of proving it is so great as\n\nto justify awarding compensatory damages without proof that such\n\ninjury actually was caused.\").\n\n            Carey establishes that there is no presumption of injury\n\nand no automatic entitlement to damages.                   Cf. Rutstein v. Avis\n\nRent-A-Car     Sys.,     Inc.,    211   F.3d   1228,     1239    (11th      Cir.   2000)\n\n(stating, in the context of reversing a class certification in a\n\n§ 1981 case, that Carey \"makes clear that in order to receive\n\ncompensatory damages, individual plaintiffs must prove that 'injury\n\nactually was caused[,]'\" and that \"[t]his is especially true since\n\ncompensatory damages under section 1981 can include damages for\n\nemotional and psychological distress\").\n\n            In a later § 1983 case, the Court reiterated \"that\n\ndamages     based   on     the    abstract     'value'      or        'importance'    of\n\nconstitutional rights are not a permissible element of compensatory\n\ndamages.\"      Stachura, 477 U.S. at 310; see also id. (\"Carey thus\n\nmakes clear that the abstract value of a constitutional right may\n\nnot form the basis for § 1983 damages.\").                That role, if it is to\n\nbe played at all, is played by nominal damages.                       Id. at 308 n.11\n\n(\"[N]ominal damages, and not damages based on some undefinable\n\n'value'   of    infringed        rights,   are     the   appropriate         means    of\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f'vindicating' rights whose deprivation has not caused actual,\n\nprovable injury.\").       So, too, here.\n\n           Nor do Title VII or § 1981 provide statutory authority\n\nfor   automatic    or    presumptive     damages.   \"The    availability   of\n\nnoneconomic damages [under these causes of action] does not mean\n\nthat their recovery is automatic whenever a plaintiff prevails.\"\n\nLindemann & Grossman, 2 Employment Discrimination Law 1828 (3d ed.\n\n1996).     \"An award of damages for emotional distress must be\n\nsupported by competent evidence of 'genuine injury,'\" Bailey v.\n\nRunyon, 220 F.3d 879, 882 (8th Cir. 2000) (some internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted) (quoting Forshee v. Waterloo Indus., Inc., 178 F.3d\n\n527, 531 (8th Cir. 1999)), the proof of which is distinct from the\n\nproof required to show discrimination, see id. (citing Browning v.\n\nPresident Riverboat Casino-Mo., Inc., 139 F.3d 631, 636 (8th Cir.\n\n1998)); see also id. at 882 (rejecting the argument that emotional\n\nharm is \"inherent\" in a finding of liability for sexual harassment\n\nunder    Title    VII,    and   noting    that   \"[t]he    Equal   Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) has made clear that '[e]motional harm\n\nwill not be presumed simply because the complaining party is a\n\nvictim of discrimination'\" (some internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(second alteration in original) (quoting Vadie v. Miss. State\n\nUniv., 218 F.3d 365, 376 (5th Cir. 2000) (quoting EEOC Policy\n\nGuidance No. 915.002 § II(A)(2) (July 14, 1992)))); Lindemann &\n\nGrossman, supra, at 1828 (\"To qualify [for noneconomic damages\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\funder the employment anti-discrimination statutes], a plaintiff\n\nmust prove that he or she sustained noneconomic injuries, such as\n\nemotional distress, pain and suffering, harm to reputation, and\n\nother consequential injury, caused by the defendant's unlawful\n\nconduct.\").       Injuries allegedly caused by the violation of Title\n\nVII or § 1981 must be proven to the factfinder -- here, a jury --\n\nwhich may reasonably find, within the law, that while there has\n\nbeen       harassment,   the   plaintiff   has   not   been   injured   in   any\n\ncompensable way by it.3          The district court quite correctly and\n\nsuccinctly noted that Azimi was improperly trying to eliminate\n\ncausation of damages from the case.\n\n\n       3\n          Azimi argues that Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510\nU.S. 17 (1993), stands for the proposition that a plaintiff need\nnot demonstrate any specific harm in order for a claim to be\ncompensable, and that he was thus entitled as a matter of law to an\naward of compensatory damages.      Azimi misreads Harris.     That\ndecision only speaks to what a plaintiff needs (or does not need)\nto show to obtain a liability judgment in a Title VII hostile work\nenvironment action.    See id. at 22 (\"Certainly Title VII bars\nconduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person's\npsychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such\nconduct. So long as the environment would reasonably be perceived,\nand is perceived, as hostile or abusive, there is no need for it\nalso to be psychologically injurious.\" (citation omitted)). This\nappeal does not turn on that issue. Indeed, no challenge has been\nraised here to the jury's liability verdict, and there is no doubt\nthat the jury reasonably found that Jordan's Meats subjected Azimi\nto an abusive working environment in violation of Title VII,\nregardless of whether Azimi demonstrated psychological injury. It\nis a separate question altogether, though, whether having made such\na liability finding, the jury was required to award Azimi\ncompensatory damages. There is nothing in Harris to override the\nordinary rule that causation of damages must be proven to, and is\nthe province of, the factfinder; if anything, Harris cuts against\nAzimi's argument, since it holds that a jury is entitled to find\nliability without necessarily finding psychological injury.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f          Azimi's alternative argument is that the jury's decision\n\nnot to award him any compensatory damages is against the weight of\n\nthe evidence.    On that basis, he contends that the district court\n\nerred both in denying his motion for a new trial on damages and in\n\nrefusing to reconsider that denial. We review the district court's\n\ndenial of motions for a new trial and for reconsideration for abuse\n\nof discretion.   Valentín-Almeyda v.

Azimi testified that\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fthe abuse he suffered at work caused him, inter alia, to become\n\n\"stressed emotionally,\" to lose sleep and appetite, and to withdraw\n\nsocially from his then fiancee (now wife), his son, and his\n\nfriends. Azimi's wife testified that, as a result of the workplace\n\nharassment, Azimi became hurt, quiet, and withdrawn; that he\n\ndeveloped   sleeping   problems;    and   that   their   marriage   became\n\nstrained. Azimi's friend also testified that during the time Azimi\n\nworked at Jordan's Meats, Azimi became \"distressed[ and] sad\" and\n\ndid not \"want to do anything.\"      None of these witnesses testified\n\nthat Azimi sought medical treatment or counseling because of the\n\nharassment, that he suffered any out-of-pocket costs for such\n\ntreatment or counseling, or that he lost any wages or paid time\n\nfrom work as a result of what happened at work.\n\n            Jordan's Meats presented evidence that Azimi instigated\n\nor participated in some of the ugly exchanges with his co-workers\n\nand that he engaged in off-color joking and teasing with at least\n\none of his harassers; that Azimi sought a permanent position at\n\nJordan's Meats and continued to work at the plant despite the\n\nharassment;4 and that Azimi's wife sought work at Jordan's Meats in\n\n2001, well after most of the harassing incidents of which Azimi\n\ncomplained at trial had taken place.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n          Azimi was hired in November 1999 as a temporary employee\nand did not become a permanent employee until July 2000.\n\n                                   -14-\n\f          The jury heard the testimony, and it was up to its\n\nmembers to evaluate it and the witnesses' demeanor and credibility.\n\n\"'Translating legal damage into money damages -- especially in\n\ncases which involve few significant items of measurable economic\n\nloss -- is a matter peculiarly within a jury's ken'\"; \"[f]or just\n\nthis reason, '[w]e rarely will override the jury's judgment on the\n\nappropriate amount of damages to be awarded.'\"           Milone v.

See Farrar v.\nHobby, 506 U.S. 103, 114 (1992) (holding that an award of nominal\ndamages makes a plaintiff a \"prevailing party\" within the meaning\nof 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and thus makes plaintiff eligible for\nattorney's fees). This circuit has yet to resolve whether a Title\n\n                                -16-\n\f            The reason that a nominal damages award is significant\n\nhere is because the law of this circuit is that no punitive damages\n\nmay be awarded in a Title VII case in the absence of an award of\n\ncompensatory damages or of nominal damages.              We so held in Kerr-\n\nSelgas v. American Airlines, Inc., 69 F.3d 1205 (1st Cir. 1995),\n\nsee id. at 1214-15, and have reiterated the rule in dicta in\n\nsubsequent cases, see Rodriguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfr.,\n\nInc., 399 F.3d 52, 65 n.12 (1st Cir. 2005); Campos-Orrego v.\n\nRivera,   175   F.3d   89,   97   (1st   Cir.   1999);   Provencher   v.

See\n\nKerr-Selgas, 69 F.3d at 1214 (\"[G]enerally a claimant may not\n\nrecover punitive damages without establishing liability for either\n\ncompensatory or nominal damages.\"           (citing Cooper Distrib. Co.,\n\nInc. v. Amana Refrigeration, Inc., 63 F.3d 262, 281-83 (3d Cir.\n\n\n\nVII and § 1981 plaintiff who wins a liability judgment and a\ndeclaratory judgment, but not a damages award, counts as a\n\"prevailing party\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k) or\n§ 1988. We express no view today on the issue.\n\n                                     -17-\n\f1995); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908 cmts. b, c (1979))).\n\nThe Kerr-Selgas rule has been criticized. See, e.g., Cush-Crawford\n\nv. Adchem Corp., 271 F.3d 352, 357-59 (2d Cir. 2001) (disagreeing\n\nwith Kerr-Selgas because, among other reasons, \"[t]here is . . . no\n\none common law rule\" and \"the statutory maxima capping punitive\n\ndamage awards [under Title VII] strongly undermine the concerns\n\nthat underlie the reluctance to award punitive damages without\n\nproof of actual harm\").       And at least three circuits do not make\n\npunitive damages in Title VII and § 1981 cases contingent on there\n\nbeing an award of compensatory or nominal damages.         See Tisdale v.\n\nFed. Express Corp., 415 F.3d 516, 534-35 (6th Cir. 2005); Cush-\n\nCrawford, 271 F.3d at 359; Timm v. Progressive Steel Treating,\n\nInc., 137 F.3d 1008, 1010-11 (7th Cir. 1998).            Indeed, only one\n\nother    circuit   appears   to   follow   the   Kerr-Selgas   rule.6   See\n\nLouisiana ACORN Fair Hous. v. LeBlanc, 211 F.3d 298, 303 (5th Cir.\n\n2000) (holding, in the context of a Fair Housing Act case, that\n\npunitive damages are not available, absent an award of actual\n\n\n\n\n     6\n          Four circuits have recognized the disagreement, but have\navoided the issue on other grounds.      See Salitros v. Chrysler\nCorp., 306 F.3d 562, 575 (8th Cir. 2002) (reserving the question\nwhether punitive damages are available in the absence of\ncompensatory and nominal damages, because punitive damages could be\npredicated on front pay, which had been awarded); Corti v. Storage\nTech. Corp., 304 F.3d 336, 341-43 (4th Cir. 2002) (allowing for\npunitive damages where there was an award of back pay); E.E.O.C. v.\nW&O, Inc., 213 F.3d 600, 615 & n.5 (11th Cir. 2000); Passantino v.\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Prods., Inc., 212 F.3d 493, 515 (9th\nCir. 2000).\n\n                                    -18-\n\fdamages, except in cases where a violation of a constitutional\n\nright has occurred).\n\n           On appeal, Azimi would like to challenge the Kerr-Selgas\n\nrule and get a remand for a trial on punitive damages.             He argues\n\nthat 42 U.S.C. § 1981a, which sets forth damages available in\n\ncertain actions under Title VII,7 does not require compensatory or\n\nnominal damages to be awarded as a predicate to an award of\n\npunitive damages.    Rather, he argues, that provision states only\n\none   precondition   to   an    award   of   punitive   damages:   that   \"the\n\ncomplaining party demonstrate[] that the respondent engaged in a\n\ndiscriminatory practice or discriminatory practices with malice or\n\nwith reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an\n\naggrieved individual.\"         42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(1).      He also argues\n\nthat the Kerr-Selgas rule applies only to Title VII cases and that\n\nthis circuit has never addressed whether punitive damages were\n\n\n\n      7\n           42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(1) provides:\n\n      In an action brought by a complaining party under section\n      706 or 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964[, 42 U.S.C. §§\n      2000e-5 or 2000e-16] against a respondent who engaged in\n      unlawful intentional discrimination (not an employment\n      practice that is unlawful because of its disparate\n      impact) prohibited under section 703, 704, or 717 of the\n      Act[, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2, 2000e-3, or 2000e-16], and\n      provided that the complaining party cannot recover under\n      section 1981 of this title, the complaining party may\n      recover compensatory and punitive damages as allowed in\n      subsection (b) of this section, in addition to any relief\n      authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of\n      1964, from the respondent.\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\favailable, in the absence of compensatory or nominal damages, under\n\n§ 1981.      We do not address these arguments.          His objections come\n\ntoo late.\n\n             Azimi did not object on the grounds articulated here to\n\nthe   jury    instructions    on   punitive   damages,    either   before   or\n\nimmediately after the jury was instructed.          Nor did he object on\n\nthese grounds to the special verdict form.               Indeed, he did not\n\nraise a challenge to the punitive damages instruction until he\n\nfiled his motion for a new trial on damages.        He thus has forfeited\n\nthe issue, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(b)(2), (c)(2) (stating that a\n\nparty that has been informed of an instruction before the jury is\n\ninstructed and before final jury arguments must object to the\n\ninstruction on the record \"before the instructions and arguments\n\nare delivered\"); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(d)(1)(A), if not\n\nwaived it entirely.          When the issue was finally presented in a\n\nmotion for a new trial, the district court found that the claim\n\ncame too late.     The court also said correctly that it was bound by\n\nthe Kerr-Selgas rule.\n\n             Had Azimi presented the issue in a timely fashion before\n\nthe district court and preserved it for appeal, this panel would\n\nordinarily also be bound by Kerr-Selgas.8          But we do not address\n\nthe question because Azimi did not timely raise the issue.           For the\n\n\n      8\n          That is, we would be bound unless there is an intervening\nand contrary Supreme Court precedent. Azimi presents no argument\nthat this is so.\n\n                                     -20-\n\fsame reason, we also do not address the question of whether\n\npunitive damages may be awarded in a § 1981 case in the absence of\n\na compensatory or nominal damages award.\n\n          Azimi asks us to resort to plain error review. But plain\n\nerror review would not help him here.   It is hardly plain that the\n\nKerr-Selgas rule is error.   Moreover, as Azimi concedes, we have\n\nnever addressed the rule in the context of a § 1981 case, so there\n\nis no plain error with respect to that argument either.9\n\n          Azimi did have an easy alternative if he wanted the jury\n\nto consider awarding him punitive damages: he could have asked for\n\nnominal damages in a timely fashion.\n\n          In situations in which an employer has been found to have\n\nviolated the law, but the jury awards no compensatory damages, the\n\nSupreme Court has said in procedural due process cases that a\n\ndistrict court ordinarily should award nominal damages.    In Farrar\n\nv. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103 (1992), a case under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the\n\nCourt stated that a finding of a procedural due process violation\n\nunaccompanied by a finding of actual injury \"obligates\" a district\n\n\n\n\n     9\n          The Fifth Circuit, in LeBlanc, identified Kerr-Selgas as\na § 1981 case. LeBlanc, 211 F.3d at 303 (\"[I]n another 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981 case, the First Circuit held that a punitive damages award\nmust be vacated absent either a compensatory damages award or a\ntimely request for nominal damages.\").      It is clear from the\ncontext of the statement, however, that the LeBlanc court meant to\nidentify Kerr-Selgas as a case under § 1981a (which sets out the\ndamages available under Title VII), not § 1981.\n\n                               -21-\n\fcourt to award nominal damages.      Id. at 112 (citing Carey, 435 U.S.\n\nat 266).\n\n            This circuit has adopted this rule of obligatory nominal\n\ndamages, but we have thus far done so only for constitutional\n\nprocedural due process claims.      See Campos-Orrego, 175 F.3d at 98.\n\nAzimi asks that we extend the rule to cover his Title VII and\n\n§ 1981 claims.     He points out that at least one circuit has done\n\nso, at least with respect to a § 1981 claim; indeed, the Eighth\n\nCircuit    has   held   that   \"proof   of   a    Section   1981   violation\n\nautomatically entitled [plaintiff] to nominal damages.\"            Hicks v.\n\nBrown Group, Inc., 902 F.2d 630, 652 (8th Cir. 1990), vacated on\n\nother grounds, 499 U.S. 914 (1990).              The Eighth Circuit rule,\n\nhowever, is not the rule of all the circuits; in fact, the Eleventh\n\nCircuit has expressly refused to extend Carey to Title VII claims.\n\nSee Walker, 944 F.2d at 845 (\"Nothing in Carey mandates the award\n\nof nominal damages for statutory violations.\").             Still, we will\n\nassume arguendo, and in Azimi's favor, that the rule set forth in\n\nCampos-Orrego, that proof of deprivation of procedural due process\n\nin a § 1983 action usually will lead to an award of nominal\n\ndamages, extends to Title VII and § 1981 cases.\n\n            Regardless of whether an award of nominal damages is\n\nobligated in a Title VII and § 1981 case where liability has been\n\nfound, a request for nominal damages may be forfeited, and has been\n\nforfeited here. This court has made clear that \"[a]lthough nominal\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fdamages are recoverable in intentional discrimination cases under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(1), . . . a liability verdict [does not]\n\ncompel[] such an award absent a timely request.\"   Kerr-Selgas, 69\n\nF.3d at 1215; see also Campos-Orrego, 175 F.3d at 98 (noting that\n\nthe entitlement to nominal damages is not \"automatic\" and that \"it\n\nis incumbent upon the plaintiff to make a timely request for\n\nnominal damages\"); accord Oliver v. Falla, 258 F.3d 1277, 1281-82\n\n(11th Cir. 2001) (agreeing with our rule and citing cases).\n\n          In this circuit, a \"plaintiff may request the judge to\n\ninstruct the jury on nominal damages, or in the absence of such an\n\ninstruction, may ask the trial court for nominal damages on the\n\noccasion of, or immediately after, the return of the verdict.\"\n\nCampos-Orrego, 175 F.3d at 99.    Our rule is plaintiff-friendly in\n\nthe sense that it does not require that plaintiffs make a strategic\n\nchoice whether to ask for a nominal damages instruction.   Indeed,\n\nthere are good reasons why a plaintiff may choose not to give a\n\njury the \"out\" of awarding nominal damages as an alternative to\n\nawarding compensatory damages. Azimi may have made such a tactical\n\nchoice here, and he is bound by his choice.\n\n          If, as here, the plaintiff chooses not to give the jury\n\nthe nominal damages question, then he or she must make a timely\n\nrequest to the court by requesting nominal damages \"on the occasion\n\nof, or immediately after, the return of the verdict.\"       Azimi,\n\nhowever, did not make a timely request that the court decide\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fwhether nominal damages should be awarded.10   Indeed, Azimi did not\n\nclearly request nominal damages until July 26, 2005 -- three months\n\nafter the verdict was returned on April 25, 2005.   That request for\n\nnominal damages came in his motion for reconsideration of the\n\ndistrict court's denial of his initial motion for a new trial, and\n\nwas presented only after the district court noted, in denying the\n\nmotion for a new trial, that Azimi was not entitled to punitive\n\ndamages, in the absence of an award of compensatory damages,\n\nbecause he had made no request for nominal damages.    In that same\n\norder, the district court correctly stated that even if such a\n\nrequest had been made in the initial motion for a new trial, the\n\nrequest would have been untimely anyway.\n\n          As a general rule, a plaintiff must make a timely claim\n\nfor all damages he seeks.   This rule takes on special importance in\n\ncases like this one, in which the availability of one type of\n\ndamages is conditioned upon the award of another.   There is a right\n\n\n\n     10\n          Azimi points out that his complaint requested \"such\nfurther relief as deemed appropriate,\" and argues that this\nstatement is tantamount to a timely request for nominal damages.\nThere is nothing in this vague prayer for relief, however, that\nwould compel the district court to award nominal damages or that\nwould even give notice to the court that such damages were being\nsought.   Azimi also argues that in his reply to defendant's\nopposition to his motion for a new trial, he wrote: \"[A]t a\nminimum, the court should award nominal damages in most cases. At\nthe very least, the court should do so in this case.\" Even if this\nperfunctory statement, articulated belatedly in a reply brief\nrather than in the motion for a new trial, would have been enough\nto put the court on notice of a nominal damages claim, the nominal\ndamages request was still untimely.\n\n                                -24-\n\fto jury trial on damages, including punitive damages, in Title VII\n\nand § 1981 cases.    See 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(c)(1) (providing for jury\n\ntrials in Title VII cases, so long as the complaining party is\n\nrequesting compensatory or punitive damages); United States v.\n\nBurke, 504 U.S. 229, 240 (1992) (\"42 U.S.C. § 1981[] permits\n\nvictims of . . . employment discrimination to obtain a jury trial\n\nat which 'both equitable and legal relief, including compensatory\n\nand,   under   certain    circumstances,    punitive   damages'   may   be\n\nawarded.\"   (quoting Johnson v. Ry. Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S.\n\n454, 460 (1975))).       If the jury is to consider whether to award,\n\nand the appropriate sum of, punitive damages, then the issue must\n\nbe submitted to the jury before it is discharged.        Cf. Walker, 944\n\nF.2d at 845 (declining to reverse district court's failure to award\n\nnominal damages for a Title VII violation where plaintiff failed to\n\nsubmit the issue to the jury, in part because of \"[t]he federal\n\ncourt's long standing policy against additur, as an intrusion on\n\nthe jury's domain and violation of the Seventh Amendment\").         This\n\nmeans that the question of whether preconditions for an award of\n\npunitive damages are met, such as the preconditions set forth in\n\nKerr-Selgas, must be answered either before, on the occasion of, or\n\nimmediately after the jury verdict.        In this case, both the motion\n\nfor a new trial and the motion for reconsideration were filed long\n\n\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fafter the jury ended its deliberations.

We review the court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo, Colburn v. Parker Hannifin/Nichols Portland Div., 429 F.3d\n\n325, 329 (1st Cir. 2005), drawing all reasonable inferences in\n\nfavor of the non-movant, Nadherny v. Roseland Prop. Co., 390 F.3d\n\n44, 48 (1st Cir. 2004).       \"'Even in employment discrimination cases\n\nwhere elusive concepts such as motive or intent are at issue,'\n\nsummary judgment is appropriate if the non-moving party rests\n\n\n     11\n          Azimi does not ask for plain error review of the nominal\ndamages issue. Regardless, there was no plain error here.\n     12\n          The magistrate judge's recommended decision, which was\nadopted by the district court, granted summary judgment on the\nmerits of the unlawful discharge theory under Title VII, § 1981,\nand the Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5,\n§ 4551 et seq. The recommended decision also held that Azimi had\nfailed to exhaust his Title VII unlawful discharge claim, and Azimi\ndid not challenge this determination before the district court.\nThus, technically all that is before us to review are the claims\nunder § 1981 and MHRA for unlawful discharge.\n\n                                    -26-\n\f'merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and\n\nunsupported speculation.'\"    Benoit v.

First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 985\n\nF.2d 1113, 1116 (1st Cir. 1993)).\n\n          In analyzing Azimi's unlawful discharge claim, we employ,\n\nas did the parties and the district court, a modified version of\n\nthe framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\n\nU.S. 792 (1973).     Rivera-García v. Sistema Universitario Ana G.\n\nMéndez, 442 F.3d 3, 5 (1st Cir. 2006).   Under this framework:\n\n          a plaintiff employee must carry the initial\n          burden of coming forward with sufficient\n          evidence to establish a prima facie case of\n          discrimination or retaliation. If he does so,\n          then the burden shifts to the employer \"to\n          articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n          reason for the employee's [termination],\"\n          sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact as\n          to whether it discriminated against the\n          employee. . . . If the employer's evidence\n          creates   a  genuine   issue   of  fact,   the\n          presumption of discrimination drops from the\n          case, and the plaintiff retains the ultimate\n          burden of showing that the employer's stated\n          reason for terminating him was in fact a\n          pretext for retaliat[ion or discrimination]\n          . . . .\n\n\n                                -27-\n\fHodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 160-61 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (first alteration in original) (citations omitted) (quoting\n\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802).\n\n           Jordan's Meats does not argue that Azimi failed to make\n\nout a prima facie case of unlawful discharge; rather, it contends\n\nthat   Azimi   failed   to   produce   sufficient   evidence   to   allow   a\n\nreasonable jury to conclude that his firing was a pretext and was\n\nactually motivated by retaliation or discrimination.                We thus\n\nassume that Azimi has made out a prima facie case and go directly\n\nto the issues of pretext and motivation.\n\n           Jordan's Meats produced admissible evidence that Brian\n\nSmith, the Human Resources Manager, and Russell Cram, Azimi's\n\nimmediate supervisor, jointly made the decision to discharge Azimi\n\nafter he engaged in five related acts of what the company perceived\n\nto be \"serious misconduct.\" Specifically, Smith's affidavit listed\n\nthe following incidents as having led to the termination of Azimi's\n\nemployment: (1) Azimi threatened and intimidated a female co-\n\nworker, Mercedes Manning, while she was alone in a dark parking lot\n\nat 6 a.m. before work; (2) Azimi attempted a second time to\n\napproach Manning in the parking lot; (3) Azimi lied when confronted\n\nwith Manning's allegations; (4) Azimi made a false allegation\n\nagainst co-worker Harry Adams; and (5) Azimi threatened Adams in\n\nthe presence of their supervisor, Russell Cram.         Smith stated that\n\nJordan's Meats \"would never let -- and . . . had never let -- any\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\femployee get away with the kind of misconduct engaged in by Mr.\n\nAzimi.\"\n\n               Smith's affidavit was supported by, inter alia, business\n\nrecords of Jordan's Meats,13 see Fed. R. Evid. 803(6), which\n\nconsisted of contemporaneous notes, which were taken by two staff\n\nmembers of the Human Resources Department at the meeting in which\n\nManning reported that Azimi threatened her, and which detail\n\nManning's allegations and the staff members' personal observations\n\nof Manning's demeanor; a signed statement from Manning reiterating\n\nher allegations against Azimi; a signed statement from Cram, who\n\nwas Azimi, Adams, and Manning's immediate supervisor, stating his\n\nfirsthand observation of Azimi \"angrily threatening [Adams],\" as\n\nwell as other reasons for his recommending that Azimi be fired; and\n\na written record of the company's investigation of, and response\n\nto, two complaints made by Azimi of what the company characterized\n\nas \"minor\" harassment by co-workers.\n\n               We initially describe Manning's complaints against Azimi\n\nabout two incidents, one on November 8 and another on November 12,\n\n2001.        We focus on the Manning incidents for several reasons.\n\n\n        13\n          Azimi vaguely suggests that defendant's evidence was not\nadmissible, Hodgens, 144 F.3d at 160, because it constituted\nhearsay evidence. The argument is insufficiently developed, and we\nthus consider it waived. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,\n17 (1st Cir. 1990).    In any event, Azimi offers no response to\nJordan's Meats' rejoinder that the exhibits were business records,\nsee Fed. R. Evid. 803(6), and that they and the affidavit were\nsubmitted to prove not the underlying events but the information\nSmith had at the time he made his decision to terminate Azimi.\n\n                                   -29-\n\fFirst, Azimi's opposition to summary judgment did not deny that\n\nManning made those allegations against him and did not argue that\n\nManning had any reason to falsely accuse him. Second, no inference\n\nof pretext can be raised from the company's response to Manning's\n\ncomplaint.     Jordan's   Meats'   investigation   into   Manning's\n\nallegations, which was conducted in large part by persons who had\n\nno prior history with Azimi, was reasonable and led the company to\n\nconclude that Manning was credible and that Azimi was not.     The\n\nseverity of the discipline that Jordan's Meats meted out as a\n\nconsequence -- termination of employment -- does not itself raise\n\nany inference of pretext or of discrimination or retaliation.\n\nThird, Azimi has produced no evidence of disparate discipline to\n\nshow that other employees who engaged in equivalent conduct of\n\nphysically intimidating and also threatening a vulnerable female\n\nco-worker in order to induce her to lie and then lying about it\n\nwere not terminated.\n\n          Manning's charge was that Azimi confronted her while she\n\nwas alone in the dark parking lot at 6 a.m. on November 8 and\n\ndemanded that she substantiate his version of an altercation that\n\nhad occurred between him and Adams, which Manning had witnessed the\n\nday earlier.    According to Manning's signed statement, Azimi\n\n\"threatened that if [she] did not tell the boss what [Azimi] wanted\n\nthat [Azimi] would tell the supervisor that Adams touches himself\n\nin front [of her] (demonstrated by grabbing his crotch) and that\n\n\n                               -30-\n\fAdams touches [her] in a sexual way.\"   Manning stated that Azimi's\n\naccusations were untrue and that Adams had never touched her or\n\nhimself in her presence.\n\n          According to Manning's statement, after Azimi threatened\n\nher in the parking lot, Manning \"did not know what to do.\"\n\nTherefore, that very day, she confided in a fellow co-worker,\n\nEstaban Batista.   At Batista's encouragement, Manning reported the\n\nincident to her supervisor, Cram, the next morning, which was\n\nFriday, November 9.   After telling Cram her account of the events,\n\nshe was interviewed, in Cram's presence, by two members of the\n\nHuman Resources Department, Sonya Voutour and Trish Thorpe.   Also\n\npresent at the meeting was Norma Finnegan, Manning's co-worker, who\n\ntranslated for Manning, whose first language is Spanish. Voutour's\n\ncontemporaneous notes, from which we quote, give Manning's account\n\nof the November 8 incident:\n\n          At approximately 6:10 am on Thursday, November\n          8, 2001[,] Mercedes arrived at the parking lot\n          across the street from Amatos.     Abdul Azimi\n          was in the parking lot and came up to her car\n          as she pulled into the parking lot.      Abdul\n          told Mercedes to park her car in this spot.\n          Mercedes was frightened and said, NO and that\n          she would park on the other side of the\n          parking lot.   Abdul kept insisting that she\n          park her car here.    Mercedes parked on the\n          other side still. Abdul came up to where she\n          parked her car and walked with her to the\n          building. Abdul told her that she must tell\n          her supervisor, Russ Cram[,] that Harry Adams\n          used a \"Bad Word\" when they were arguing\n          yesterday (Wednesday). Mercedes told him that\n          the problem was between Harry and himself\n          (Abdul) and not with her.     Abdul frightened\n\n                                -31-\n\f           her by insisting that she must tell Russ Cram\n           that Harry used a \"Bad Word\" with Abdul during\n           the incident.     Mercedes asked why he was\n           getting her involved with a problem between\n           Harry and himself (Abdul).         Abdul told\n           Mercedes that if she did not tell Russ that\n           Harry used a \"Bad Word\" with Abdul then he\n           would say bad things to people.       Mercedes\n           demonstrated the gesture Abdul used when\n           saying the next line.     Mercedes lifted her\n           sweatshirt up a bit and grabbed for her crotch\n           area.    Abdul told her that he would tell\n           people that Harry would grab himself, in a\n           sexual way, and point it toward Mercedes. He\n           (Abdul) would also tell people that Harry\n           would grab Mercedes in a sexual way. Mercedes\n           told Abdul that it wasn't her problem[,] and\n           the problem was between Harry and himself\n           (Abdul).\n\n           Other contemporaneous notes by Thorpe of the meeting are\n\nconsistent with Voutour's and add that \"Mercedes was visibly upset\n\nand near tears many times\" as she told her story.      Thorpe also\n\nnoted that Manning said that she told Azimi that she did not hear\n\nAdams say what Azimi accused Adams of saying and asked Azimi why he\n\n\"wanted his problem to be her problem.\"     Thorpe also noted that\n\nManning denied that Adams had ever touched her, and said that she\n\nwas happily married.   Finally, Thorpe noted that \"Mercedes stated\n\nthat she was worried about coming into work because it is dark when\n\nshe arrives,\" and that Cram told Manning that he would make sure\n\nthat someone would be there to escort her into the plant in the\n\nmorning.\n\n           In sum, Manning told the Human Resources Department that\n\nshe was afraid of Azimi, and to others she appeared genuinely\n\n\n                               -32-\n\fafraid.     Manning also told the Human Resources Department and\n\nreiterated in her own signed statement that Azimi insisted that she\n\nget involved in his problems, that Azimi told her to lie, and that\n\nwhen she refused, Azimi threatened to disseminate lies about her\n\nand Adams concerning the sensitive topic of sexual conduct.           It is\n\nself-evident that Azimi's threatened statements would cause serious\n\nproblems for Manning with her husband, with Adams, and in her\n\nworkplace.\n\n            According to Manning's statement, on Monday, November 12,\n\nthe next work day after she reported the incident with Azimi to her\n\nsupervisor and the Human Resources Department, she saw Azimi\n\nsitting in his car in the same parking lot, with his car's lights\n\noff and engine running, which caused her to be \"afraid\" that he was\n\nplanning to confront her again.         According to Smith's deposition,\n\na supervisor had to go to the parking lot and escort Manning into\n\nthe plant.      As a result of the incidents, Manning said that she\n\nfiled a complaint against Azimi with the Portland Police Department\n\nshortly after the November 12 incident.\n\n            Jordan's Meats placed Azimi on indefinite suspension\n\nwhile     the   company   initiated     an   investigation   of   Manning's\n\nallegations, and, the record shows, Azimi was eventually terminated\n\non November 19, 2001, ten days after Manning made her initial\n\ncomplaint.      According to Smith's deposition, as           part of the\n\ninvestigation, Smith, who was out of town on November 8 and 9,\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\fpersonally interviewed Manning when he returned to the plant on\n\nNovember 12.      Manning repeated to Smith the allegations against\n\nAzimi and told Smith of her plans to file a police report about the\n\nincident.     Smith stated in his deposition that the police did, in\n\nfact, follow up on Manning's allegations.\n\n              A few days after speaking with Manning, Smith and Cram\n\ninterviewed      Azimi.     According        to   Smith's     affidavit,   Azimi\n\n\"repeatedly and strongly denied any and all wrongdoing and gave\n\nexculpatory explanations for his parking lot conduct (i.e., that he\n\nwas    just   there   smoking   a   cigarette     and   not   waiting   for   Ms.\n\nManning[,] that Ms. Manning's English is so poor that he could not\n\npossibly have threatened her as she claims, and she must have\n\nmisunderstood what happened).\"\n\n              Smith explained that he ultimately credited Manning's\n\naccount for several reasons.          According to Smith's affidavit, he\n\nand his staff spoke directly with Manning, and from personal\n\nobservation, he noted that Manning, whom he described as \"a small,\n\nvulnerable, Hispanic woman,\" struck him as genuinely \"terrified\" of\n\nAzimi.    At his deposition, Smith said that he was convinced that\n\nManning did, in fact, understand what Azimi had said to her that\n\nday in the parking lot, because Smith himself had engaged in\n\nconversations in English with Manning and it was his experience\n\nthat \"[s]he can understand [English] a lot better than she speaks\n\nit.\"     Smith also testified that Cram had told him that Manning's\n\n\n                                      -34-\n\faccount was corroborated 'almost verbatim' by someone else.                  In\n\nfact, Smith's impression was that Cram had told him that this other\n\nsource was Azimi himself.         Finally, Smith noted that Manning was\n\nnot   involved   in   any   of   the    previous   incidents   of   harassment\n\ncomplained of by Azimi.\n\n           In addition to Manning's allegations, Smith also relied\n\non as grounds for terminating Azimi the signed statement by Cram,\n\nin which Cram detailed a number of other reasons, in addition to\n\nthe incidents with Manning, why he supported terminating Azimi's\n\nemployment.      Of   particular       significance   to   Smith    was   Cram's\n\nstatement that \"on the afternoon of November 7, 2001 in my office\n\nand in my presence, [Azimi] very angrily threatened another male\n\nteam member [Adams] to settle things outside.\"             Cram said that he\n\nwas \"concerned and frightened\" by \"the terrifying expression on\n\n. . . Azimi's face and in his eyes when he\" made this threat.              Cram\n\nalso noted that \"Azimi had a history of not being cooperative with\"\n\nco-workers and that \"[m]any allegations were made against . . .\n\nAzimi, but he always denied any wrong doing.\" Finally, Cram stated\n\nthat \"there have been credibility issues\" with Azimi.                     As an\n\nexample, Cram said that one of Azimi's co-workers had reported that\n\nan anonymously written racist note that Azimi found in his locker\n\nwas actually planted by Azimi himself; the co-worker \"explained in\n\nvivid detail that . . . Azimi had showed him the note and admitted\n\nhe had planted it.\"         Smith confirmed at his deposition that the\n\n\n                                       -35-\n\femployee, Kurt Chim, had indeed come forward in February 2001,\n\nabout a year after Azimi complained about the note, and told Smith\n\nthat he had talked with Azimi, that Azimi had admitted placing the\n\nnote in his own locker, and that Azimi believed the planting of the\n\nnote would help him get hired full time.             Chim, whom Smith found\n\ncredible,   explained   that    he   had    not    wanted   to   get   involved\n\ninitially because he did not want to be perceived as a \"rat.\"              Chim\n\nalso told Smith that he had gone to high school with Azimi and that\n\nit was his opinion that Azimi had always been a dishonest person.\n\n            Whether Azimi told the truth about the Manning and Adams\n\nincidents is not the point. Jordan's Meats had a substantial basis\n\nfor concluding that Azimi was not credible and had engaged in the\n\nmisconduct charged.\n\n            In response to these specific reasons that Jordan's Meats\n\noffered for terminating him, Azimi offered only the following\n\nevidence in support of his opposition to summary judgment: (1) his\n\nown   deposition   testimony,    which      he    characterizes   as    denying\n\nManning's allegations; and (2) an administrative decision by the\n\nMaine Department of Labor (MDOL) regarding his eligibility for\n\nunemployment benefits.    He also relies on two other arguments: (1)\n\nthat he was terminated for his misconduct, while others were not\n\ndisciplined for what he claims was equivalent misconduct; and (2)\n\nthat he was fired nine months after he filed his second complaint\n\n\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\fwith the MHRC and two months after the September 11, 2001 attacks.\n\nWe consider each in turn.\n\n            Azimi's    opposing   statement     of   material   facts    merely\n\noffered this conclusory allegation:\n\n            In retaliation for Mr. Azimi's charges of\n            discrimination filed [with] the Maine Human\n            Rights Commission and as a further act of\n            discrimination, Defendant discharged Plaintiff\n            on false grounds on November 19, 2001. Azimi\n            Deposition at 249-264.\n\nThe referenced deposition pages do not refute the employer's\n\nexplanation    about    believing      what   Manning   and   Cram    said    had\n\nhappened.    Those    pages   merely    recount   Azimi's     version    of   the\n\nNovember 8 incident, which was that he was smoking a cigarette by\n\nhis car in the parking lot when Manning approached him and said \"I\n\nam sorry\" and something about \"Harry Adams\"; that Azimi did not\n\nunderstand    what    Manning   was    saying   because   she   was     speaking\n\nSpanish; that the only thing he said to Manning was that she should\n\n\"talk to Russell\"; and that he and Manning walked into the plant\n\ntogether.     Azimi did not deny that Manning made the complaints\n\nagainst him, did not explain why the account that Manning gave on\n\na consistent basis each time she described it differed so much from\n\nhis own, and did not give any reason why Manning would lie to her\n\nemployer about what happened in the parking lot.\n\n            Azimi's denial of wrongdoing is not enough to raise an\n\ninference of pretext, on these facts, where the company undertook\n\na reasonable investigation, heard his side of the story, and\n\n                                       -37-\n\fdecided that his accuser's was more credible.                \"In assessing\n\npretext,   a   court's   'focus   must   be   on   the   perception   of   the\n\ndecisionmaker,' that is, whether the employer believed its stated\n\nreason to be credible,\" subject to some limitations not present\n\nhere.

Azimi has\n\nnot made that showing here.\n\n           Azimi also relies on a decision from an unemployment\n\nbenefits hearing before the MDOL, in which the MDOL concluded that\n\nJordan's Meats had not met its burden of proving that Azimi was\n\nineligible to receive certain unemployment benefits because he had\n\n\n                                   -38-\n\fengaged in misconduct within the meaning of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 26, § 1043(23)(A)(10).        See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26,\n\n§ 1193(2) (disqualifying a claimant \"discharged for misconduct\n\nconnected with his work\" from benefits for a certain period of\n\ntime).   Azimi observes that the MDOL had reached its decision in\n\nlarge part because it determined that Manning's English skills were\n\nso limited as to undermine Jordan's Meats' account of the parking\n\nlot incident.    Azimi argues that the MDOL's reasoning is enough to\n\nraise a material dispute of fact about the credibility of Jordan's\n\nMeats' explanation for terminating him.\n\n           The MDOL decision, however, does not in its conclusion or\n\nrationale help him.     That decision merely found the employer had\n\nnot \"prove[d] that [Azimi's] conduct [met] the statutory definition\n\nof misconduct.\"   It did not address or find that Jordan's Meats had\n\nno reasonable basis to believe that Azimi had engaged in misconduct\n\nor even that Manning herself was not credible; in fact, the MDOL\n\nspecifically    noted   that   Manning,   who   was   called   to   testify,\n\n\"testified that she felt threatened by the encounter in the parking\n\nlot.\"    Nor did the MDOL even purport to address the questions of\n\nwhether Azimi had been more harshly disciplined than a similarly\n\nsituated employee, or, if so, whether the difference in treatment\n\nwas motivated by an intent to discriminate or retaliate.\n\n           In contrast, at the summary judgment stage, it is up to\n\nAzimi to produce sufficient evidence to generate a material dispute\n\n\n                                   -39-\n\fof fact that Jordan's Meats' articulated reasons for firing him\n\nwere pretext.   Most importantly -- even if Azimi were to show that\n\nhe did not, in fact, threaten Manning and, further, that Jordan's\n\nMeats knew that he did not and fired him anyway -- Azimi still must\n\nproduce sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably\n\ninfer that the real reason Jordan's Meats fired him was because of\n\ndiscrimination or retaliation.\n\n           Azimi argues that a jury could reasonably infer that\n\nJordan's Meats was motivated by discriminatory or retaliatory\n\nanimus, because he was terminated for his misconduct while other\n\nemployees were disciplined more leniently for similar misbehavior.\n\nThere were four types of misconduct leading up to the termination\n\ndecision, according to Smith: (1) the two incidents in the parking\n\nlot with Manning; (2) lying about the Manning incident; (3) making\n\nfalse allegations against Adams; and (4) threatening Adams in the\n\npresence of Cram.   This case does not involve, as Azimi seems to\n\nargue, only the third and fourth categories of misconduct.    This\n\ncase involves, in addition to those two categories, intimidating a\n\nfemale co-worker in a dark parking lot, threatening to spread\n\nrumors about her if she did not lie, and putting her in genuine\n\nfear.   Azimi has provided no evidence of comparable misconduct and\n\nhas not met his burden of providing evidence that the employment of\n\nco-workers who had committed misconduct similar to that act or that\n\ncombination of acts were not also terminated.\n\n\n                                 -40-\n\f            In his statement of material facts, Azimi refers to\n\nJordan's Meats' failure to terminate the employment of co-workers\n\nwhom he accused of calling him names and using off-color or obscene\n\nlanguage.   Use of such language, not uncommon on a meat-processing\n\nplant floor, is simply not similar to the conduct in which Azimi\n\nwas reported to have engaged.    More serious are his claims that\n\nGeorge Libby engaged in inappropriate roughhousing by \"grabb[ing\n\nAzimi] hard by the waist [and] thrusting his [Libby's] groin into\n\n[Azimi's] buttocks,\" and that Azimi felt threatened when another\n\nco-worker said that she was going to break his \"fucking teeth out.\"\n\nThat Jordan's Meats, which investigated the incidents, concluded\n\nthat neither Libby's conduct nor an angry exchange between mutually\n\nabusive co-workers was the equivalent of the behavior for which\n\nAzimi was terminated does not raise an inference of discrimination.\n\nIndeed, Jordan's Meats had reason to believe that Azimi may have\n\nbeen the instigator of some of these verbal and physical exchanges.\n\n            In fact, there was undisputed evidence in the summary\n\njudgment record that at least one co-worker, Libby, complained that\n\nAzimi himself had directed verbal insults and physical conduct\n\ntoward Libby, which was offensive and threatening.   Yet Azimi was\n\nnot disciplined as a result.   Libby complained to Smith that Azimi\n\nhad called Libby names, such as \"fat ass\"; that Azimi also had\n\ngrabbed him from behind and humped him; that Azimi had \"on many\n\n\n\n\n                                -41-\n\ftimes\" tried to grab him and restrain him; and that Libby was\n\nafraid of Azimi.\n\n          The record shows that Jordan's Meats did, in fact,\n\ndiscipline Libby and other co-workers whom the company found to\n\nhave harassed Azimi.    The female co-worker who threatened to break\n\nAzimi's teeth was issued a warning; Libby was suspended for three\n\ndays for his harassment of Azimi and would have been terminated if\n\nhis conduct had not improved; and another co-worker, Phil Ryan, was\n\nsuspended for one day for phoning Azimi and making racist comments,\n\nafter Ryan said Azimi called him \"a fat ass\" and told him that he\n\nwas going to \"cut his fat ass.\"\n\n          Nor does Azimi offer any evidence from which a jury could\n\nreasonably infer that the individuals who made the decision to\n\nterminate him -- specifically, Smith and Cram -- harbored any type\n\nof discriminatory or retaliatory animus toward him. That Smith, as\n\nthe Human Resources Manager, and Cram, as Azimi's supervisor, dealt\n\nwith some of Azimi's complaints of pre-termination harassment, is\n\nnot enough to allow the inference that they terminated him because\n\nof unlawful animus.14   In fact, the evidence in the record tends to\n\n\n     14\n          Azimi does not argue that any of his harassers was\ninvolved in the decision to terminate him. See Medina-Munoz, 896\nF.2d at 10 (\"The biases of one who neither makes nor influences the\nchallenged personnel decision are not probative in an employment\ndiscrimination case.\"). Nor does Azimi allege that this is a case\nlike Cariglia v. Hertz Equipment Rental Corp., 363 F.3d 77 (1st\nCir. 2004), in which a neutral decisionmaker is induced to act\nbased on inaccurate information provided because of the provider's\ndiscriminatory animus. There is no claim that Manning or Adams\n\n                                 -42-\n\fshow that Smith and Cram were sympathetic to many of Azimi's\n\ncomplaints and were trying to stamp out any discrimination at the\n\ncompany.   For example, according to Smith's deposition, when Azimi\n\nfound   the    note    in   his   locker    in   1999,   Smith   undertook   an\n\ninvestigation.        He even forwarded the note and handwriting samples\n\nto a handwriting expert, who could not identify the author.             Smith\n\nthen had several meetings with small groups of employees on three\n\nshifts, informed them that the letter was despicable and that such\n\nconduct would not be tolerated in the company, and distributed a\n\nmemo he wrote on workplace behavior and diversity awareness.\n\n              Finally, Azimi suggests that a reasonable factfinder\n\ncould infer animus from the fact that he was fired within nine\n\nmonths of the filing of his second complaint with the MHRC and\n\nwithin two months after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World\n\nTrade Center and other targets.            Nine months is simply too long a\n\ntime lapse to support an inference of retaliatory animus.                When\n\nAzimi has proffered no additional evidence of discriminatory animus\n\non the part of Smith or any other decisionmaker, the fact that he\n\nwas fired two months after September 11 also is not enough to\n\ngenerate a material dispute of fact on the unlawful discharge\n\ntheory.\n\n\n\n\nwere biased against Azimi because of his race, religion, or\nethnicity. The record shows that Manning, Adams, and Azimi had a\ncordial relationship prior to the events of November 7, 2001.\n\n                                      -43-\n\f           Drawing all reasonable inferences in Azimi's favor, we\n\nconclude based on our review of the summary judgment record that\n\nsummary   judgment   was   warranted    in   relation   to   the   unlawful\n\ndischarge claims.    The law does not protect the jobs of those who\n\nthreaten other employees with harm, even if they themselves have\n\nbeen mistreated.     That Azimi was wronged gave him no right to do\n\nwrong.\n\n                                 III.\n\n           Judgment affirmed.    Each side shall bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -44-\n\f",

Azimi had put on no evidence of any out-of-pocket costs he had incurred for medical treatment or psychological counseling, or of any wages lost as a result of the abuse he suffered at his workplace; instead, he relied only on his own testimony and the testimony of his wife and a friend about his emotional distress&#8212;testimony that the jury reasonably rejected as a basis for awarding compensatory damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Azimi, supported by amicus Maine Civil Liberties Union Foundation (MCLUF), advances the argument that, as a matter of law, a finding of a hostile work environment requires that there be an award of compensatory damages, even if a jury has rejected plaintiff's causation-of-damages evidence. This argument was long ago rejected by the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi also did not receive nominal damages. That is because he did not ask for them in a timely fashion; he chose not to submit the question of nominal damages to the jury, and he waited far too long to request them from the district court. He thus has forfeited the issue. Azimi now asserts that nominal damages must be awarded as a matter of law even if nominal damages were not timely requested. We reject the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Azimi had not been awarded back pay, or compensatory damages, or nominal damages, the law of this circuit, at least with respect to his Title VII claim, is that he could not receive punitive damages. Although Azimi now wishes us to reconsider that rule, he failed to timely raise this issue with the trial court. Further, as to both his Title VII and &#167; 1981 claims, he did not object to the jury instruction on punitive damages or to the special verdict form, both of which stated that punitive damages could not be awarded if compensatory damages were not. Indeed, his argument that punitive damages ought not be contingent on compensatory damages was not made until his motion for a new trial, which was denied by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi now asks that we hold that in &#167; 1981 cases, whatever the rule in Title VII cases, there is no prerequisite that there be nominal or compensatory damages before punitive damages may be granted. We decline to reach the issue; it, too, was not preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Azimi contends that the district court erred in entering summary judgment for Jordan's Meats on Azimi's unlawful discharge claims. Azimi had argued that his discharge was discriminatory and that it was also in retaliation for his earlier complaints to the Maine Human Rights Commission (MHRC). The district court found that Azimi had produced no evidence of pretext countering Jordan's Meats' explanation that it terminated Azimi's employment because he engaged in serious misconduct, including threatening a female co-worker in a dark parking lot. We affirm the district court's judgment in all respects. This case potentially raised a number of serious issues; none were preserved for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where appropriate, we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, <i>Torres-Rivera v. O'Neill-Cancel,</i> 406 F.3d 43, 45 (1st Cir.2005), and discuss the pertinent facts with the issues raised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Azimi's Claim for Compensatory Damages</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi was employed at the Jordan's Meats plant in Portland, Maine, from November 1999 to November 2001. During the period Azimi was employed, the company had about 150 full-time employees. Azimi worked in various positions while at the plant, including as a meat slicer and a meat stripper. At trial, Azimi testified that he had been the subject of discriminatory treatment and abusive and harassing behavior by some of his former co-workers and supervisors. The incidents of maltreatment are myriad and outrageous; we recite only a few examples.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On multiple occasions, one of Azimi's line leaders, Steve Mitton, physically obstructed the hot water tap so as to prevent Azimi from washing his hands, which were swollen from handling frozen meat. While Azimi was only allowed access to the cold water tap, Mitton permitted other, white employees to use the hot water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Azimi was transferred to another department. There, a co-worker, George Libby, made numerous disparaging comments to Azimi about his religion, including: \"If you eat pork and pussy, you become strong like me.\" When Azimi told Libby that both oral sex and the consumption of pork were against his religion, Libby said, \"fuck you and fuck your God; fuck your religion.\" On separate occasions, Libby, whom Azimi described as weighing about three hundred pounds, also grabbed Azimi by the neck and tried to shove pork into Azimi's mouth; held Azimi by the waist and pumped him from behind, simulating sexual intercourse; and told Azimi to \"suck my dick\" and, when Azimi took umbrage at the comment, picked Azimi up and dangled him, off the floor, by his arms, while other co-workers watched and laughed. Libby and another co-worker, Phil Ryan, also called Azimi on one of the phones in the plant and said to him, among other things, \"Nigger, Sudan [sic] Hussein is waiting for you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to a number of other instances of verbal abuse and maltreatment by co-workers, Azimi was also subject to other offensive conduct, often by anonymous perpetrators. For example, he received an unsigned note in his locker; on one side of the note was scrawled a swastika and on the other side was written:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hey MotherFucker Why don't You GO BACK to your Own Country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You don't bE long HERE you Fucking musselum</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">You PIECE of Shit WE <i>HATE YOU</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">ALL ThE MUSSELUMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You Don't don't bElong here AT JORDANSMEAT.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">YOUR NOTHing but a Fucking <i>NIGGER</i> . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi also once found pieces of pork in the pockets of his work jacket; found a picture in his locker of Osama Bin Laden, on which was written the words \"Abdul,\" \"Mother Fucker,\" and \"Your Dad need [sic] Help\"; and discovered that his goggles and hearing-protection equipment were smashed to pieces, and that his personal shoes had been taken from his work locker and stuck in the toilet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi testified that he reported the harassment to his supervisors; that Brian Smith, the Human Resources Manager, and other supervisors failed to adequately investigate the incidents and to impose appropriate punishment on the wrongdoers; and that the harassment continued despite his complaints and his supervisors' promises to address them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing the evidence, the jury found, by way of a special verdict form, that Azimi \"was subjected to an offensive work environment that was hostile to his race, religion[,] or ethnic origin,\" and that Jordan's Meats \"knew or should have known of the offensive hostile work environment and failed to take adequate and effective remedial measures.\" The jury, however, answered \"no\" to the question of whether \"Defendant Jordan's Meats, Inc.'s unlawful harassment legally caused [Azimi] to be damaged by emotional distress, pain, suffering, emotional anguish, loss of enjoyment of life[,] and/or inconvenience.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> As a result of this finding, the jury followed the district court's instructions and the special verdict form, and did not go on to consider what amount Azimi was entitled to recover as compensation for any injuries suffered. There were no objections to the special verdict form and the jury instructions, a point that we analyze later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Azimi's contention is that the jury was required to award compensatory damages, either as a matter of law or because the evidence compelled it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi, supported by the MCLUF, first argues that inherent in a finding of a hostile work environment is a finding that the claimant suffered damages, such that any liability finding must be accompanied by an award of compensatory damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> Azimi and amicus present the issue as one of inconsistency in the jury verdict. They also argue that the importance of the interests at stake requires that there be an award of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both arguments have been repudiated by the Supreme Court. Indeed, in <i>Carey v. Piphus,</i> 435 U.S. 247, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978), the Court rejected, in the context of a claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, the arguments (1) that injury should be presumed from the violation of a constitutional right and (2) that damages should be awarded for a deprivation of a constitutional right regardless of whether any injury was caused. <i>See id.</i> at 254, 98 S.Ct. 1042. The Court noted that \"[r]ights, <i>constitutional and otherwise,</i> do not exist in a vacuum,\" and that \"[t]heir purpose is to protect persons from injuries to particular interests,\" such that without proof of injury, no compensatory damages are possible. <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added); <i>see also Memphis Cmty.

We so held in <i>Kerr-Selgas v. American Airlines, Inc.,</i> 69 F.3d 1205 (1st Cir.1995), <i>see id.</i> at 1214-15, and have reiterated the rule in dicta in subsequent cases, <i>see Rodriguez-Torres v.

Co., Inc. v. Amana Refrigeration, Inc.,</i> 63 F.3d 262, 281-83 (3d Cir.1995); <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 908 cmts. b, c (1979))). The <i>Kerr-Selgas</i> rule has been criticized. <i>See, e.g., Cush-Crawford v. Adchem Corp.,</i> 271 F.3d 352, 357-59 (2d Cir.2001) (disagreeing with <i>Kerr-Selgas</i> because, among other reasons, \"[t]here is . . . no one common law rule\" and \"the statutory maxima capping punitive damage awards [under Title VII] strongly undermine the concerns that underlie the reluctance to award punitive damages without proof of actual harm\"). And at least three circuits do not make punitive damages in Title VII and &#167; 1981 cases contingent on there being an award of compensatory or nominal damages. <i>See Tisdale v. Fed. Express Corp.,</i> 415 F.3d 516, 534-35 (6th Cir.2005); <i>Cush-Crawford,</i> 271 F.3d at 359; <i>Timm v. Progressive Steel Treating, Inc.,</i> 137 F.3d 1008, 1010-11 (7th Cir.1998). Indeed, only one other circuit appears to follow the <i>Kerr-Selgas</i> rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a> <i>See Louisiana ACORN Fair Hous. v. LeBlanc,</i> 211 F.3d 298, 303 (5th Cir.2000) (holding, in the context of a Fair Housing Act case, that punitive damages are not available, absent an award of actual damages, except in cases where a violation of a constitutional right has occurred).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Azimi would like to challenge the <i>Kerr-Selgas</i> rule and get a remand for a trial on punitive damages. He argues that 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a, which sets forth damages available in certain actions under Title VII,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> does not require compensatory or nominal damages to be awarded as a predicate to an award of punitive damages. Rather, he argues, that provision states only one precondition to an award of punitive damages: that \"the complaining party demonstrate[] that the respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice or discriminatory practices with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(b)(1). He also argues that the <i>Kerr-Selgas</i> rule applies only to Title VII cases and that this circuit has never addressed whether punitive damages were available, in the absence of compensatory or nominal damages, under &#167; 1981. We do not address these arguments. His objections come too late.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi did not object on the grounds articulated here to the jury instructions on punitive damages, either before or immediately after the jury was instructed. Nor did he object on these grounds to the special verdict form. Indeed, he did not raise a challenge to the punitive damages instruction until he filed his motion for a new trial on damages. He thus has forfeited the issue, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(b)(2), (c)(2) (stating that a party that has been informed of an instruction before the jury is instructed and before final jury arguments must object to the instruction on the record \"before the instructions and arguments are delivered\"); <i>see also</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 51(d)(1)(A), if not waived it entirely. When the issue was finally presented in a motion for a new trial, the district court found that the claim came too late. The court also said correctly that it was bound by the <i>Kerr-Selgas</i> rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Azimi presented the issue in a timely fashion before the district court and preserved it for appeal, this panel would ordinarily also be bound by <i>Kerr-Selgas.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> But we do not address the question because Azimi did not timely raise the issue. For the same reason, we also do not address the question of whether punitive damages may be awarded in a &#167; 1981 case in the absence of a compensatory or nominal damages award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi asks us to resort to plain error review. But plain error review would not help him here. It is hardly plain that the <i>Kerr-Selgas</i> rule is error. Moreover, as Azimi concedes, we have never addressed the rule in the context of a &#167; 1981 case, so there is no plain error with respect to that argument either.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi did have an easy alternative if he wanted the jury to consider awarding him punitive damages: he could have asked for nominal damages in a timely fashion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In situations in which an employer has been found to have violated the law, but the jury awards no compensatory damages, the Supreme Court has said in procedural due process cases that a district court ordinarily should award nominal damages. In <i>Farrar v. Hobby,</i> 506 U.S. 103, 113 S.Ct. 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992), a case under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, the Court stated that a finding of a procedural due process violation unaccompanied by a finding of actual injury \"obligates\" a district court to award nominal damages. <i>Id.</i> at 112, 113 S.Ct. 566 (citing <i>Carey,</i> 435 U.S. at 266, 98 S.Ct. 1042).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has adopted this rule of obligatory nominal damages, but we have thus far done so only for constitutional procedural due process claims. <i>See Campos-Orrego,</i> 175 F.3d at 98. Azimi asks that we extend the rule to cover his Title VII and &#167; 1981 claims. He points out that at least one circuit has done so, at least with respect to a &#167; 1981 claim; indeed, the Eighth Circuit has held that \"proof of a Section 1981 violation automatically entitled [plaintiff] to nominal damages.\" <i>Hicks v. Brown Group, Inc.,</i> 902 F.2d 630, 652 (8th Cir.1990), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> 499 U.S. 914, 111 S.Ct. 1299, 113 L.Ed.2d 234 (1991). The Eighth Circuit rule, however, is not the rule of all the circuits; in fact, the Eleventh Circuit has expressly refused to extend <i>Carey</i> to Title VII claims. <i>See Walker,</i> 944 F.2d at 845 (\"Nothing in <i>Carey</i> mandates the award of nominal damages for statutory violations.\"). Still, we will assume arguendo, and in Azimi's favor, that the rule set forth in <i>Campos-Orrego,</i> that proof of deprivation of procedural due process in a &#167; 1983 action usually will lead to an award of nominal damages, extends to Title VII and &#167; 1981 cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of whether an award of nominal damages is obligated in a Title VII and &#167; 1981 case where liability has been found, a request for nominal damages may be forfeited, and has been forfeited here. This court has made clear that \"[a]lthough nominal damages are recoverable in intentional discrimination cases under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(a)(1), . . . a liability verdict [does not] <i>compel</i> [] such an award absent a timely request.\" <i>Kerr-Selgas,</i> 69 F.3d at 1215; <i>see also Campos-Orrego,</i> 175 F.3d at 98 (noting that the entitlement to nominal damages is not \"automatic\" and that \"it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to make a timely request for nominal damages\"); <i>accord Oliver v. Falla,</i> 258 F.3d 1277, 1281-82 (11th Cir.2001) (agreeing with our rule and citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this circuit, a \"plaintiff may request the judge to instruct the jury on nominal damages, or in the absence of such an instruction, may ask the trial court for nominal damages on the occasion of, or immediately after, the return of the verdict.\" <i>Campos-Orrego,</i> 175 F.3d at 99. Our rule is plaintiff-friendly in the sense that it does not require that plaintiffs make a strategic choice whether to ask for a nominal damages instruction. Indeed, there are good reasons why a plaintiff may choose not to give a jury the \"out\" of awarding nominal damages as an alternative to awarding compensatory damages. Azimi may have made such a tactical choice here, and he is bound by his choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, as here, the plaintiff chooses not to give the jury the nominal damages question, then he or she must make a <i>timely</i> request to the court by requesting nominal damages \"on the occasion of, or immediately after, the return of the verdict.\" Azimi, however, did not make a timely request that the court decide whether nominal damages should be awarded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Indeed, Azimi did not clearly request nominal damages until July 26, 2005&#8212;three months after the verdict was returned on April 25, 2005. That request for nominal damages came in his motion for reconsideration of the district court's denial of his initial motion for a new trial, and was presented only after the district court noted, in denying the motion for a new trial, that Azimi was not entitled to punitive damages, in the absence of an award of compensatory damages, because he had made no request for nominal damages. In that same order, the district court correctly stated that even if such a request had been made in the initial motion for a new trial, the request would have been untimely anyway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, a plaintiff must make a timely claim for all damages he seeks. This rule takes on special importance in cases like this one, in which the availability of one type of damages is conditioned upon the award of another. There is a right to jury trial on damages, including punitive damages, in Title VII and &#167; 1981 cases. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(c)(1) (providing for jury trials in Title VII cases, so long as the complaining party is requesting compensatory or punitive damages); <i>United States v. Burke,</i> 504 U.S. 229, 240, 112 S.Ct. 1867, 119 L.Ed.2d 34 (1992) (\"42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981[] permits victims of . . . employment discrimination to obtain a jury trial at which `both equitable and legal relief, including compensatory and, under certain circumstances, punitive damages' may be awarded.\" (quoting <i>Johnson v. Ry. Express Agency, Inc.,</i> 421 U.S. 454, 460, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975))). If the jury is to consider whether to award, and the appropriate sum of, punitive damages, then the issue must be submitted to the jury before it is discharged. <i>Cf. Walker,</i> 944 F.2d at 845 (declining to reverse district court's failure to award nominal damages for a Title VII violation where plaintiff failed to submit the issue to the jury, in part because of \"[t]he federal court's long standing policy against additur, as an intrusion on the jury's domain and violation of the Seventh Amendment\"). This means that the question of whether preconditions for an award of punitive damages are met, such as the preconditions set forth in <i>Kerr-Selgas,</i> must be answered either before, on the occasion of, or immediately after the jury verdict. In this case, both the motion for a new trial and the motion for reconsideration were filed long after the jury ended its deliberations. Azimi thus has forfeited his claim for nominal damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Grant of Summary Judgment on the Unlawful Discharge Claims</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to Azimi's final argument: that his unlawful discharge claims should not have been resolved against him on summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, after oral argument, adopted and affirmed the magistrate judge's recommended decision granting summary judgment in favor of Jordan's Meats on Azimi's unlawful discharge claims.

Smith stated that Jordan's Meats \"would never let&#8212;and . . . had never let&#8212; any employee get away with the kind of misconduct engaged in by Mr. Azimi.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith's affidavit was supported by, inter alia, business records of Jordan's Meats,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 803(6), which consisted of contemporaneous notes, which were taken by two staff members of the Human Resources Department at the meeting in which Manning reported that Azimi threatened her, and which detail Manning's allegations and the staff members' personal observations of Manning's demeanor; a signed statement from Manning reiterating her allegations against Azimi; a signed statement from Cram, who was Azimi, Adams, and Manning's immediate supervisor, stating his firsthand observation of Azimi \"angrily threatening [Adams],\" as well as other reasons for his recommending that Azimi be fired; and a written record of the company's investigation of, and response to, two complaints made by Azimi of what the company characterized as \"minor\" harassment by co-workers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We initially describe Manning's complaints against Azimi about two incidents, one on November 8 and another on November 12, 2001. We focus on the Manning incidents for several reasons. First, Azimi's opposition to summary judgment did not deny that Manning made those allegations against him and did not argue that Manning had any reason to falsely accuse him. Second, no inference of pretext can be raised from the company's response to Manning's complaint. Jordan's Meats' investigation into Manning's allegations, which was conducted in large part by persons who had no prior history with Azimi, was reasonable and led the company to conclude that Manning was credible and that Azimi was not. The severity of the discipline that Jordan's Meats meted out as a consequence&#8212;termination of employment&#8212;does not itself raise any inference of pretext or of discrimination or retaliation. Third, Azimi has produced no evidence of disparate discipline to show that other employees who engaged in equivalent conduct of physically intimidating and also threatening a vulnerable female co-worker in order to induce her to lie and then lying about it were not terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manning's charge was that Azimi confronted her while she was alone in the dark parking lot at 6 a.m. on November 8 and demanded that she substantiate his version of an altercation that had occurred between him and Adams, which Manning had witnessed the day earlier. According to Manning's signed statement, Azimi \"threatened that if [she] did not tell the boss what [Azimi] wanted that [Azimi] would tell the supervisor that Adams touches himself in front [of her] (demonstrated by grabbing his crotch) and that Adams touches [her] in a sexual way.\" Manning stated that Azimi's accusations were untrue and that Adams had never touched her or himself in her presence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Manning's statement, after Azimi threatened her in the parking lot, Manning \"did not know what to do.\" Therefore, that very day, she confided in a fellow co-worker, Estaban Batista. At Batista's encouragement, Manning reported the incident to her supervisor, Cram, the next morning, which was Friday, November 9. After telling Cram her account of the events, she was interviewed, in Cram's presence, by two members of the Human Resources Department, Sonya Voutour and Trish Thorpe. Also present at the meeting was Norma Finnegan, Manning's co-worker, who translated for Manning, whose first language is Spanish. Voutour's contemporaneous notes, from which we quote, give Manning's account of the November 8 incident:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 6:10 am on Thursday, November 8, 2001[,] Mercedes arrived at the parking lot across the street from Amatos. Abdul Azimi was in the parking lot and came up to her car as she pulled into the parking lot. Abdul told Mercedes to park her car in this spot. Mercedes was frightened and said, NO and that she would park on the other side of the parking lot. Abdul kept insisting that she park her car here. Mercedes parked on the other side still. Abdul came up to where she parked her car and walked with her to the building. Abdul told her that she must tell her supervisor, Russ Cram[,] that Harry Adams used a \"Bad Word\" when they were arguing yesterday (Wednesday). Mercedes told him that the problem was between Harry and himself (Abdul) and not with her. Abdul frightened her by insisting that she must tell Russ Cram that Harry used a \"Bad Word\" with Abdul during the incident. Mercedes asked why he was getting her involved with a problem between Harry and himself (Abdul). Abdul told Mercedes that if she did not tell Russ that Harry used a \"Bad Word\" with Abdul then he would say bad things to people. Mercedes demonstrated the gesture Abdul used when saying the next line. Mercedes lifted her sweatshirt up a bit and grabbed for her crotch area. Abdul told her that he would tell people that Harry would grab himself, in a sexual way, and point it toward Mercedes. He (Abdul) would also tell people that Harry would grab Mercedes in a sexual way. Mercedes told Abdul that it wasn't her problem[,] and the problem was between Harry and himself (Abdul).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other contemporaneous notes by Thorpe of the meeting are consistent with Voutour's and add that \"Mercedes was visibly upset and near tears many times\" as she told her story. Thorpe also noted that Manning said that she told Azimi that she did not hear Adams say what Azimi accused Adams of saying and asked Azimi why he \"wanted his problem to be her problem.\" Thorpe also noted that Manning denied that Adams had ever touched her, and said that she was happily married. Finally, Thorpe noted that \"Mercedes stated that she was worried about coming into work because it is dark when she arrives,\" and that Cram told Manning that he would make sure that someone would be there to escort her into the plant in the morning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Manning told the Human Resources Department that she was afraid of Azimi, and to others she appeared genuinely afraid. Manning also told the Human Resources Department and reiterated in her own signed statement that Azimi insisted that she get involved in his problems, that Azimi told her to lie, and that when she refused, Azimi threatened to disseminate lies about her and Adams concerning the sensitive topic of sexual conduct. It is self-evident that Azimi's threatened statements would cause serious problems for Manning with her husband, with Adams, and in her workplace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Manning's statement, on Monday, November 12, the next work day after she reported the incident with Azimi to her supervisor and the Human Resources Department, she saw Azimi sitting in his car in the same parking lot, with his car's lights off and engine running, which caused her to be \"afraid\" that he was planning to confront her again. According to Smith's deposition, a supervisor had to go to the parking lot and escort Manning into the plant. As a result of the incidents, Manning said that she filed a complaint against Azimi with the Portland Police Department shortly after the November 12 incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jordan's Meats placed Azimi on indefinite suspension while the company initiated an investigation of Manning's allegations, and, the record shows, Azimi was eventually terminated on November 19, 2001, ten days after Manning made her initial complaint. According to Smith's deposition, as part of the investigation, Smith, who was out of town on November 8 and 9, personally interviewed Manning when he returned to the plant on November 12. Manning repeated to Smith the allegations against Azimi and told Smith of her plans to file a police report about the incident. Smith stated in his deposition that the police did, in fact, follow up on Manning's allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days after speaking with Manning, Smith and Cram interviewed Azimi. According to Smith's affidavit, Azimi \"repeatedly and strongly denied any and all wrongdoing and gave exculpatory explanations for his parking lot conduct (i.e., that he was just there smoking a cigarette and not waiting for Ms. Manning[,] that Ms. Manning's English is so poor that he could not possibly have threatened her as she claims, and she must have misunderstood what happened).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith explained that he ultimately credited Manning's account for several reasons. According to Smith's affidavit, he and his staff spoke directly with Manning, and from personal observation, he noted that Manning, whom he described as \"a small, vulnerable, Hispanic woman,\" struck him as genuinely \"terrified\" of Azimi. At his deposition, Smith said that he was convinced that Manning did, in fact, understand what Azimi had said to her that day in the parking lot, because Smith himself had engaged in conversations in English with Manning and it was his experience that \"[s]he can understand [English] a lot better than she speaks it.\" Smith also testified that Cram had told him that Manning's account was corroborated `almost verbatim' by someone else. In fact, Smith's impression was that Cram had told him that this other source was Azimi himself. Finally, Smith noted that Manning was not involved in any of the previous incidents of harassment complained of by Azimi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to Manning's allegations, Smith also relied on as grounds for terminating Azimi the signed statement by Cram, in which Cram detailed a number of other reasons, in addition to the incidents with Manning, why he supported terminating Azimi's employment. Of particular significance to Smith was Cram's statement that \"on the afternoon of November 7, 2001 in my office and in my presence, [Azimi] very angrily threatened another male team member [Adams] to settle things outside.\" Cram said that he was \"concerned and frightened\" by \"the terrifying expression on . . . Azimi's face and in his eyes when he\" made this threat. Cram also noted that \"Azimi had a history of not being cooperative with\" co-workers and that \"[m]any allegations were made against . . . Azimi, but he always denied any wrong doing.\" Finally, Cram stated that \"there have been credibility issues\" with Azimi. As an example, Cram said that one of Azimi's co-workers had reported that an anonymously written racist note that Azimi found in his locker was actually planted by Azimi himself; the co-worker \"explained in vivid detail that . . . Azimi had showed him the note and admitted he had planted it.\" Smith confirmed at his deposition that the employee, Kurt Chim, had indeed come forward in February 2001, about a year after Azimi complained about the note, and told Smith that he had talked with Azimi, that Azimi had admitted placing the note in his own locker, and that Azimi believed the planting of the note would help him get hired full time. Chim, whom Smith found credible, explained that he had not wanted to get involved initially because he did not want to be perceived as a \"rat.\" Chim also told Smith that he had gone to high school with Azimi and that it was his opinion that Azimi had always been a dishonest person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Azimi told the truth about the Manning and Adams incidents is not the point. Jordan's Meats had a substantial basis for concluding that Azimi was not credible and had engaged in the misconduct charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to these specific reasons that Jordan's Meats offered for terminating him, Azimi offered only the following evidence in support of his opposition to summary judgment: (1) his own deposition testimony, which he characterizes as denying Manning's allegations; and (2) an administrative decision by the Maine Department of Labor (MDOL) regarding his eligibility for unemployment benefits. He also relies on two other arguments: (1) that he was terminated for his misconduct, while others were not disciplined for what he claims was equivalent misconduct; and (2) that he was fired nine months after he filed his second complaint with the MHRC and two months after the September 11, 2001 attacks. We consider each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi's opposing statement of material facts merely offered this conclusory allegation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In retaliation for Mr. Azimi's charges of discrimination filed [with] the Maine Human Rights Commission and as a further act of discrimination, Defendant discharged Plaintiff on false grounds on November 19, 2001.

Those pages merely recount Azimi's version of the November 8 incident, which was that he was smoking a cigarette by his car in the parking lot when Manning approached him and said \"I am sorry\" and something about \"Harry Adams\"; that Azimi did not understand what Manning was saying because she was speaking Spanish; that the only thing he said to Manning was that she should \"talk to Russell\"; and that he and Manning walked into the plant together. Azimi did not deny that Manning made the complaints against him, did not explain why the account that Manning gave on a consistent basis each time she described it differed so much from his own, and did not give any reason why Manning would lie to her employer about what happened in the parking lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi's denial of wrongdoing is not enough to raise an inference of pretext, on these facts, where the company undertook a reasonable investigation, heard his side of the story, and decided that his accuser's was more credible. \"In assessing pretext, a court's `focus must be on the perception of the decisionmaker,' that is, whether the employer believed its stated reason to be credible,\" subject to some limitations not present here. <i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 824 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting <i>Gray v. New Eng. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,</i> 792 F.2d 251, 256 (1st Cir.1986)); <i>see also Rivera-Aponte v. Rest. Metropol # 3, Inc.,</i> 338 F.3d 9, 11-12 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Whether a termination decision was wise or done in haste is irrelevant, so long as the decision was not made with discriminatory animus.\"). Although an \"employer's good faith belief is not automatically conclusive,\" <i>Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt &amp; Colman, Inc.,</i> 277 F.3d 40, 46 (1st Cir.2002), \"[i]t is not enough for a plaintiff merely to impugn the veracity of the employer's justification; he must elucidate specific facts which would enable a jury to find that the reason given is not only a sham, but a sham intended to cover up the employer's real [and unlawful] motive\" of discrimination, <i>Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 824 (internal quotation mark omitted) (quoting <i>Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 896 F.2d 5, 9 (1st Cir.1990)). Azimi has not made that showing here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi also relies on a decision from an unemployment benefits hearing before the MDOL, in which the MDOL concluded that Jordan's Meats had not met its burden of proving that Azimi was ineligible to receive certain unemployment benefits because he had engaged in misconduct within the meaning of Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 1043(23)(A)(10). <i>See</i> Me. Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 1193(2) (disqualifying a claimant \"discharged for misconduct connected with his work\" from benefits for a certain period of time). Azimi observes that the MDOL had reached its decision in large part because it determined that Manning's English skills were so limited as to undermine Jordan's Meats' account of the parking lot incident. Azimi argues that the MDOL's reasoning is enough to raise a material dispute of fact about the credibility of Jordan's Meats' explanation for terminating him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MDOL decision, however, does not in its conclusion or rationale help him. That decision merely found the <i>employer</i> had not \"prove[d] that [Azimi's] conduct [met] the statutory definition of misconduct.\" It did not address or find that Jordan's Meats had no reasonable basis to believe that Azimi had engaged in misconduct or even that Manning herself was not credible; in fact, the MDOL specifically noted that Manning, who was called to testify, \"testified that she felt threatened by the encounter in the parking lot.\" Nor did the MDOL even purport to address the questions of whether Azimi had been more harshly disciplined than a similarly situated employee, or, if so, whether the difference in treatment was motivated by an intent to discriminate or retaliate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, at the summary judgment stage, it is up to Azimi to produce sufficient evidence to generate a material dispute of fact that Jordan's Meats' articulated reasons for firing him were pretext. Most importantly&#8212;even if Azimi were to show that he did not, in fact, threaten Manning and, further, that Jordan's Meats knew that he did not and fired him anyway &#8212; Azimi still must produce sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that the real reason Jordan's Meats fired him was because of discrimination or retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi argues that a jury could reasonably infer that Jordan's Meats was motivated by discriminatory or retaliatory animus, because he was terminated for his misconduct while other employees were disciplined more leniently for similar misbehavior. There were four types of misconduct leading up to the termination decision, according to Smith: (1) the two incidents in the parking lot with Manning; (2) lying about the Manning incident; (3) making false allegations against Adams; and (4) threatening Adams in the presence of Cram. This case does not involve, as Azimi seems to argue, only the third and fourth categories of misconduct. This case involves, in addition to those two categories, intimidating a female co-worker in a dark parking lot, threatening to spread rumors about her if she did not lie, and putting her in genuine fear. Azimi has provided no evidence of comparable misconduct and has not met his burden of providing evidence that the employment of co-workers who had committed misconduct similar to that act or that combination of acts were not also terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his statement of material facts, Azimi refers to Jordan's Meats' failure to terminate the employment of co-workers whom he accused of calling him names and using off-color or obscene language. Use of such language, not uncommon on a meat-processing plant floor, is simply not similar to the conduct in which Azimi was reported to have engaged. More serious are his claims that George Libby engaged in inappropriate roughhousing by \"grabb[ing Azimi] hard by the waist [and] thrusting his [Libby's] groin into [Azimi's] buttocks,\" and that Azimi felt threatened when another co-worker said that she was going to break his \"fucking teeth out.\" That Jordan's Meats, which investigated the incidents, concluded that neither Libby's conduct nor an angry exchange between mutually abusive co-workers was the equivalent of the behavior for which Azimi was terminated does not raise an inference of discrimination. Indeed, Jordan's Meats had reason to believe that Azimi may have been the instigator of some of these verbal and physical exchanges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, there was undisputed evidence in the summary judgment record that at least one co-worker, Libby, complained that Azimi himself had directed verbal insults and physical conduct toward Libby, which was offensive and threatening. Yet Azimi was not disciplined as a result. Libby complained to Smith that Azimi had called Libby names, such as \"fat ass\"; that Azimi also had grabbed him from behind and humped him; that Azimi had \"on many times\" tried to grab him and restrain him; and that Libby was afraid of Azimi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows that Jordan's Meats did, in fact, discipline Libby and other co-workers whom the company found to have harassed Azimi. The female co-worker who threatened to break Azimi's teeth was issued a warning; Libby was suspended for three days for his harassment of Azimi and would have been terminated if his conduct had not improved; and another co-worker, Phil Ryan, was suspended for one day for phoning Azimi and making racist comments, after Ryan said Azimi called him \"a fat ass\" and told him that he was going to \"cut his fat ass.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does Azimi offer any evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that the individuals who made the decision to terminate him&#8212;specifically, Smith and Cram&#8212;harbored any type of discriminatory or retaliatory animus toward him. That Smith, as the Human Resources Manager, and Cram, as Azimi's supervisor, dealt with some of Azimi's complaints of pre-termination harassment, is not enough to allow the inference that they terminated him because of unlawful animus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> In fact, the evidence in the record tends to show that Smith and Cram were sympathetic to many of Azimi's complaints and were trying to stamp out any discrimination at the company. For example, according to Smith's deposition, when Azimi found the note in his locker in 1999, Smith undertook an investigation. He even forwarded the note and handwriting samples to a handwriting expert, who could not identify the author. Smith then had several meetings with small groups of employees on three shifts, informed them that the letter was despicable and that such conduct would not be tolerated in the company, and distributed a memo he wrote on workplace behavior and diversity awareness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Azimi suggests that a reasonable factfinder could infer animus from the fact that he was fired within nine months of the filing of his second complaint with the MHRC and within two months after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and other targets. Nine months is simply too long a time lapse to support an inference of retaliatory animus. When Azimi has proffered no additional evidence of discriminatory animus on the part of Smith or any other decisionmaker, the fact that he was fired two months after September 11 also is not enough to generate a material dispute of fact on the unlawful discharge theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drawing all reasonable inferences in Azimi's favor, we conclude based on our review of the summary judgment record that summary judgment was warranted in relation to the unlawful discharge claims. The law does not protect the jobs of those who threaten other employees with harm, even if they themselves have been mistreated. That Azimi was wronged gave him no right to do wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment <i>affirmed.</i> Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The special verdict form and the jury's answers read as follows:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">1</a>\n        <p class=\"indent\"> Has Plaintiff, Abdul Azimi, proven by a preponderance of evidence that he was subjected to an offensive work environment that was hostile to his race, religion or ethnic origin?</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Yes <i>X</i> No ___</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">[If you answered Question 1 \"YES,\" go on to Question 2.

Concord Hosp., Inc.,</i> 265 F.3d 79, 82 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting <i>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 787, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998)). Amicus argues that \"[i]t cannot be possible that the Jordan's Meats workplace was both objectively and subjectively offensive such that a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive, and that Mr. Azimi in fact did perceive [it to] be so, and yet Mr. Azimi sustained no injury from that experience.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">3</a>\n        <p> Azimi argues that<i>Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,</i> 510 U.S. 17, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993), stands for the proposition that a plaintiff need not demonstrate any specific harm in order for a claim to be compensable, and that he was thus entitled as a matter of law to an award of compensatory damages. Azimi misreads <i>Harris.</i> That decision only speaks to what a plaintiff needs (or does not need) to show to obtain a liability judgment in a Title VII hostile work environment action. <i>See id.</i> at 22, 114 S.Ct. 367 (\"Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person's psychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, there is no need for it also to be psychologically injurious.\" (citation omitted)). This appeal does not turn on that issue. Indeed, no challenge has been raised here to the jury's liability verdict, and there is no doubt that the jury reasonably found that Jordan's Meats subjected Azimi to an abusive working environment in violation of Title VII, regardless of whether Azimi demonstrated psychological injury. It is a separate question altogether, though, whether having made such a liability finding, the jury was <i>required</i> to award Azimi compensatory damages. There is nothing in <i>Harris</i> to override the ordinary rule that causation of damages must be proven to, and is the province of, the factfinder; if anything, <i>Harris</i> cuts against Azimi's argument, since it holds that a jury is entitled to find liability without necessarily finding psychological injury.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">4</a>\n        <p> Azimi was hired in November 1999 as a temporary employee and did not become a permanent employee until July 2000</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">5</a>\n        <p> Defendants suggest that the lack of an award of nominal damages may be important to the issue of whether Azimi is a prevailing party for an award of attorney's fees<i>See Farrar v.

Azimi had put on no evidence of any out-of-pocket costs he had incurred for medical treatment or psychological counseling, or of any wages lost as a result of the abuse he suffered at his workplace; instead, he relied only on his own testimony and the testimony of his wife and a friend about his emotional distress&#8212;testimony that the jury reasonably rejected as a basis for awarding compensatory damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Azimi, supported by amicus Maine Civil Liberties Union Foundation (MCLUF), advances the argument that, as a matter of law, a finding of a hostile work environment requires that there be an award of compensatory damages, even if a jury has rejected plaintiff's causation-of-damages evidence. This argument was long ago rejected by the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi also did not receive nominal damages. That is because he did not ask for them in a timely fashion; he chose not to submit the question of nominal damages to the jury, and he waited far too long to request them from the district court. He thus has forfeited the issue. Azimi now asserts that nominal damages must be awarded as a matter of law even if nominal damages were not timely requested. We reject the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Azimi had not been awarded back pay, or compensatory damages, or nominal damages, the law of this circuit, at least with respect to his Title VII claim, is that he could not receive punitive damages. Although Azimi now wishes us to reconsider that rule, he failed to timely raise this issue with the trial court. Further, as to both his Title VII and &#167; 1981 claims, he did not object to the jury instruction on punitive damages or to the special verdict form, both of which stated that punitive damages could not be awarded if compensatory damages were not. Indeed, his argument that punitive damages ought not be contingent on compensatory damages was not made until his motion for a new trial, which was denied by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi now asks that we hold that in &#167; 1981 cases, whatever the rule in Title VII cases, there is no prerequisite that there be nominal or compensatory damages before punitive damages may be granted. We decline to reach the issue; it, too, was not preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Azimi contends that the district court erred in entering summary judgment for Jordan's Meats on Azimi's unlawful discharge claims. Azimi had argued that his discharge was discriminatory and that it was also in retaliation for his earlier complaints to the Maine Human Rights Commission (MHRC). The district court found that Azimi had produced no evidence of pretext countering Jordan's Meats' explanation that it terminated Azimi's employment because he engaged in serious misconduct, including threatening a female co-worker in a dark parking lot. We affirm the district court's judgment in all respects. This case potentially raised a number of serious issues; none were preserved for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where appropriate, we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, <i>Torres-Rivera v.

During the period Azimi was employed, the company had about 150 full-time employees. Azimi worked in various positions while at the plant, including as a meat slicer and a meat stripper. At trial, Azimi testified that he had been the subject of discriminatory treatment and abusive and harassing behavior by some of his former co-workers and supervisors. The incidents of maltreatment are myriad and outrageous; we recite only a few examples.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On multiple occasions, one of Azimi's line leaders, Steve Mitton, physically obstructed the hot water tap so as to prevent Azimi from washing his hands, which were swollen from handling frozen meat. While Azimi was only allowed access to the cold water tap, Mitton permitted other, white employees to use the hot water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Azimi was transferred to another department. There, a co-worker, George Libby, made numerous disparaging comments to Azimi about his religion, including: \"If you eat pork and pussy, you become strong like me.\" When Azimi told Libby that both oral sex and the consumption of pork were against his religion, Libby said, \"fuck you and fuck your God; fuck your religion.\" On separate occasions, Libby, whom Azimi described as weighing about three hundred pounds, also grabbed Azimi by the neck and tried to shove pork into Azimi's mouth; held Azimi by the waist and pumped him from behind, simulating sexual intercourse; and told Azimi to \"suck my dick\" and, when Azimi took umbrage at the comment, picked Azimi up and dangled him, off the floor, by his arms, while other co-workers watched and laughed. Libby and another co-worker, Phil Ryan, also called Azimi on one of the phones in the plant and said to him, among other things, \"Nigger, Sudan [sic] Hussein is waiting for you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to a number of other instances of verbal abuse and maltreatment by co-workers, Azimi was also subject to other offensive conduct, often by anonymous perpetrators. For example, he received an unsigned note in his locker; on one side of the note was scrawled a swastika and on the other side was written:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hey MotherFucker Why don't You GO BACK to your Own Country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You don't bE long HERE you Fucking musselum</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">You PIECE of Shit WE <i>HATE YOU</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">ALL ThE MUSSELUMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You Don't don't bElong here AT JORDANSMEAT.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">YOUR NOTHing but a Fucking <i>NIGGER</i> . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi also once found pieces of pork in the pockets of his work jacket; found a picture in his locker of Osama Bin Laden, on which was written the words \"Abdul,\" \"Mother Fucker,\" and \"Your Dad need [sic] Help\"; and discovered that his goggles and hearing-protection equipment were smashed to pieces, and that his personal shoes had been taken from his work locker and stuck in the toilet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi testified that he reported the harassment to his supervisors; that Brian Smith, the Human Resources Manager, and other supervisors failed to adequately investigate the incidents and to impose appropriate punishment on the wrongdoers; and that the harassment continued despite his complaints and his supervisors' promises to address them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing the evidence, the jury found, by way of a special verdict form, that Azimi \"was subjected to an offensive work environment that was hostile to his race, religion[,] or ethnic origin,\" and that Jordan's Meats \"knew or should have known of the offensive hostile work environment and failed to take adequate and effective remedial measures.\" The jury, however, answered \"no\" to the question of whether \"Defendant Jordan's Meats, Inc.'s unlawful harassment legally caused [Azimi] to be damaged by emotional distress, pain, suffering, emotional anguish, loss of enjoyment of life[,] and/or inconvenience.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> As a result of this finding, the jury followed the district court's instructions and the special verdict form, and did not go on to consider what amount Azimi was entitled to recover as compensation for any injuries suffered. There were no objections to the special verdict form and the jury instructions, a point that we analyze later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Azimi's contention is that the jury was required to award compensatory damages, either as a matter of law or because the evidence compelled it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi, supported by the MCLUF, first argues that inherent in a finding of a hostile work environment is a finding that the claimant suffered damages, such that any liability finding must be accompanied by an award of compensatory damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> Azimi and amicus present the issue as one of inconsistency in the jury verdict.

Still, we will assume arguendo, and in Azimi's favor, that the rule set forth in <i>Campos-Orrego,</i> that proof of deprivation of procedural due process in a &#167; 1983 action usually will lead to an award of nominal damages, extends to Title VII and &#167; 1981 cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of whether an award of nominal damages is obligated in a Title VII and &#167; 1981 case where liability has been found, a request for nominal damages may be forfeited, and has been forfeited here. This court has made clear that \"[a]lthough nominal damages are recoverable in intentional discrimination cases under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(a)(1), . . . a liability verdict [does not] <i>compel</i> [] such an award absent a timely request.\" <i>Kerr-Selgas,</i> 69 F.3d at 1215; <i>see also Campos-Orrego,</i> 175 F.3d at 98 (noting that the entitlement to nominal damages is not \"automatic\" and that \"it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to make a timely request for nominal damages\"); <i>accord Oliver v.

Our rule is plaintiff-friendly in the sense that it does not require that plaintiffs make a strategic choice whether to ask for a nominal damages instruction. Indeed, there are good reasons why a plaintiff may choose not to give a jury the \"out\" of awarding nominal damages as an alternative to awarding compensatory damages. Azimi may have made such a tactical choice here, and he is bound by his choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, as here, the plaintiff chooses not to give the jury the nominal damages question, then he or she must make a <i>timely</i> request to the court by requesting nominal damages \"on the occasion of, or immediately after, the return of the verdict.\" Azimi, however, did not make a timely request that the court decide whether nominal damages should be awarded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Indeed, Azimi did not clearly request nominal damages until July 26, 2005&#8212;three months after the verdict was returned on April 25, 2005. That request for nominal damages came in his motion for reconsideration of the district court's denial of his initial motion for a new trial, and was presented only after the district court noted, in denying the motion for a new trial, that Azimi was not entitled to punitive damages, in the absence of an award of compensatory damages, because he had made no request for nominal damages. In that same order, the district court correctly stated that even if such a request had been made in the initial motion for a new trial, the request would have been untimely anyway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, a plaintiff must make a timely claim for all damages he seeks. This rule takes on special importance in cases like this one, in which the availability of one type of damages is conditioned upon the award of another. There is a right to jury trial on damages, including punitive damages, in Title VII and &#167; 1981 cases. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(c)(1) (providing for jury trials in Title VII cases, so long as the complaining party is requesting compensatory or punitive damages); <i>United States v.

If the jury is to consider whether to award, and the appropriate sum of, punitive damages, then the issue must be submitted to the jury before it is discharged. <i>Cf. Walker,</i> 944 F.2d at 845 (declining to reverse district court's failure to award nominal damages for a Title VII violation where plaintiff failed to submit the issue to the jury, in part because of \"[t]he federal court's long standing policy against additur, as an intrusion on the jury's domain and violation of the Seventh Amendment\"). This means that the question of whether preconditions for an award of punitive damages are met, such as the preconditions set forth in <i>Kerr-Selgas,</i> must be answered either before, on the occasion of, or immediately after the jury verdict. In this case, both the motion for a new trial and the motion for reconsideration were filed long after the jury ended its deliberations.

We focus on the Manning incidents for several reasons. First, Azimi's opposition to summary judgment did not deny that Manning made those allegations against him and did not argue that Manning had any reason to falsely accuse him. Second, no inference of pretext can be raised from the company's response to Manning's complaint. Jordan's Meats' investigation into Manning's allegations, which was conducted in large part by persons who had no prior history with Azimi, was reasonable and led the company to conclude that Manning was credible and that Azimi was not. The severity of the discipline that Jordan's Meats meted out as a consequence&#8212;termination of employment&#8212;does not itself raise any inference of pretext or of discrimination or retaliation. Third, Azimi has produced no evidence of disparate discipline to show that other employees who engaged in equivalent conduct of physically intimidating and also threatening a vulnerable female co-worker in order to induce her to lie and then lying about it were not terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manning's charge was that Azimi confronted her while she was alone in the dark parking lot at 6 a.m. on November 8 and demanded that she substantiate his version of an altercation that had occurred between him and Adams, which Manning had witnessed the day earlier. According to Manning's signed statement, Azimi \"threatened that if [she] did not tell the boss what [Azimi] wanted that [Azimi] would tell the supervisor that Adams touches himself in front [of her] (demonstrated by grabbing his crotch) and that Adams touches [her] in a sexual way.\" Manning stated that Azimi's accusations were untrue and that Adams had never touched her or himself in her presence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Manning's statement, after Azimi threatened her in the parking lot, Manning \"did not know what to do.\" Therefore, that very day, she confided in a fellow co-worker, Estaban Batista. At Batista's encouragement, Manning reported the incident to her supervisor, Cram, the next morning, which was Friday, November 9. After telling Cram her account of the events, she was interviewed, in Cram's presence, by two members of the Human Resources Department, Sonya Voutour and Trish Thorpe. Also present at the meeting was Norma Finnegan, Manning's co-worker, who translated for Manning, whose first language is Spanish. Voutour's contemporaneous notes, from which we quote, give Manning's account of the November 8 incident:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 6:10 am on Thursday, November 8, 2001[,] Mercedes arrived at the parking lot across the street from Amatos. Abdul Azimi was in the parking lot and came up to her car as she pulled into the parking lot. Abdul told Mercedes to park her car in this spot. Mercedes was frightened and said, NO and that she would park on the other side of the parking lot. Abdul kept insisting that she park her car here. Mercedes parked on the other side still. Abdul came up to where she parked her car and walked with her to the building. Abdul told her that she must tell her supervisor, Russ Cram[,] that Harry Adams used a \"Bad Word\" when they were arguing yesterday (Wednesday). Mercedes told him that the problem was between Harry and himself (Abdul) and not with her. Abdul frightened her by insisting that she must tell Russ Cram that Harry used a \"Bad Word\" with Abdul during the incident. Mercedes asked why he was getting her involved with a problem between Harry and himself (Abdul). Abdul told Mercedes that if she did not tell Russ that Harry used a \"Bad Word\" with Abdul then he would say bad things to people. Mercedes demonstrated the gesture Abdul used when saying the next line. Mercedes lifted her sweatshirt up a bit and grabbed for her crotch area. Abdul told her that he would tell people that Harry would grab himself, in a sexual way, and point it toward Mercedes. He (Abdul) would also tell people that Harry would grab Mercedes in a sexual way. Mercedes told Abdul that it wasn't her problem[,] and the problem was between Harry and himself (Abdul).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other contemporaneous notes by Thorpe of the meeting are consistent with Voutour's and add that \"Mercedes was visibly upset and near tears many times\" as she told her story. Thorpe also noted that Manning said that she told Azimi that she did not hear Adams say what Azimi accused Adams of saying and asked Azimi why he \"wanted his problem to be her problem.\" Thorpe also noted that Manning denied that Adams had ever touched her, and said that she was happily married. Finally, Thorpe noted that \"Mercedes stated that she was worried about coming into work because it is dark when she arrives,\" and that Cram told Manning that he would make sure that someone would be there to escort her into the plant in the morning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Manning told the Human Resources Department that she was afraid of Azimi, and to others she appeared genuinely afraid. Manning also told the Human Resources Department and reiterated in her own signed statement that Azimi insisted that she get involved in his problems, that Azimi told her to lie, and that when she refused, Azimi threatened to disseminate lies about her and Adams concerning the sensitive topic of sexual conduct. It is self-evident that Azimi's threatened statements would cause serious problems for Manning with her husband, with Adams, and in her workplace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Manning's statement, on Monday, November 12, the next work day after she reported the incident with Azimi to her supervisor and the Human Resources Department, she saw Azimi sitting in his car in the same parking lot, with his car's lights off and engine running, which caused her to be \"afraid\" that he was planning to confront her again. According to Smith's deposition, a supervisor had to go to the parking lot and escort Manning into the plant. As a result of the incidents, Manning said that she filed a complaint against Azimi with the Portland Police Department shortly after the November 12 incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jordan's Meats placed Azimi on indefinite suspension while the company initiated an investigation of Manning's allegations, and, the record shows, Azimi was eventually terminated on November 19, 2001, ten days after Manning made her initial complaint. According to Smith's deposition, as part of the investigation, Smith, who was out of town on November 8 and 9, personally interviewed Manning when he returned to the plant on November 12. Manning repeated to Smith the allegations against Azimi and told Smith of her plans to file a police report about the incident. Smith stated in his deposition that the police did, in fact, follow up on Manning's allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days after speaking with Manning, Smith and Cram interviewed Azimi. According to Smith's affidavit, Azimi \"repeatedly and strongly denied any and all wrongdoing and gave exculpatory explanations for his parking lot conduct (i.e., that he was just there smoking a cigarette and not waiting for Ms. Manning[,] that Ms. Manning's English is so poor that he could not possibly have threatened her as she claims, and she must have misunderstood what happened).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith explained that he ultimately credited Manning's account for several reasons. According to Smith's affidavit, he and his staff spoke directly with Manning, and from personal observation, he noted that Manning, whom he described as \"a small, vulnerable, Hispanic woman,\" struck him as genuinely \"terrified\" of Azimi. At his deposition, Smith said that he was convinced that Manning did, in fact, understand what Azimi had said to her that day in the parking lot, because Smith himself had engaged in conversations in English with Manning and it was his experience that \"[s]he can understand [English] a lot better than she speaks it.\" Smith also testified that Cram had told him that Manning's account was corroborated `almost verbatim' by someone else. In fact, Smith's impression was that Cram had told him that this other source was Azimi himself. Finally, Smith noted that Manning was not involved in any of the previous incidents of harassment complained of by Azimi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to Manning's allegations, Smith also relied on as grounds for terminating Azimi the signed statement by Cram, in which Cram detailed a number of other reasons, in addition to the incidents with Manning, why he supported terminating Azimi's employment. Of particular significance to Smith was Cram's statement that \"on the afternoon of November 7, 2001 in my office and in my presence, [Azimi] very angrily threatened another male team member [Adams] to settle things outside.\" Cram said that he was \"concerned and frightened\" by \"the terrifying expression on . . . Azimi's face and in his eyes when he\" made this threat. Cram also noted that \"Azimi had a history of not being cooperative with\" co-workers and that \"[m]any allegations were made against . . . Azimi, but he always denied any wrong doing.\" Finally, Cram stated that \"there have been credibility issues\" with Azimi. As an example, Cram said that one of Azimi's co-workers had reported that an anonymously written racist note that Azimi found in his locker was actually planted by Azimi himself; the co-worker \"explained in vivid detail that . . . Azimi had showed him the note and admitted he had planted it.\" Smith confirmed at his deposition that the employee, Kurt Chim, had indeed come forward in February 2001, about a year after Azimi complained about the note, and told Smith that he had talked with Azimi, that Azimi had admitted placing the note in his own locker, and that Azimi believed the planting of the note would help him get hired full time. Chim, whom Smith found credible, explained that he had not wanted to get involved initially because he did not want to be perceived as a \"rat.\" Chim also told Smith that he had gone to high school with Azimi and that it was his opinion that Azimi had always been a dishonest person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Azimi told the truth about the Manning and Adams incidents is not the point.

He also relies on two other arguments: (1) that he was terminated for his misconduct, while others were not disciplined for what he claims was equivalent misconduct; and (2) that he was fired nine months after he filed his second complaint with the MHRC and two months after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Azimi did not deny that Manning made the complaints against him, did not explain why the account that Manning gave on a consistent basis each time she described it differed so much from his own, and did not give any reason why Manning would lie to her employer about what happened in the parking lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi's denial of wrongdoing is not enough to raise an inference of pretext, on these facts, where the company undertook a reasonable investigation, heard his side of the story, and decided that his accuser's was more credible. \"In assessing pretext, a court's `focus must be on the perception of the decisionmaker,' that is, whether the employer believed its stated reason to be credible,\" subject to some limitations not present here. <i>Mesnick v.

Azimi has not made that showing here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi also relies on a decision from an unemployment benefits hearing before the MDOL, in which the MDOL concluded that Jordan's Meats had not met its burden of proving that Azimi was ineligible to receive certain unemployment benefits because he had engaged in misconduct within the meaning of Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 1043(23)(A)(10). <i>See</i> Me. Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 1193(2) (disqualifying a claimant \"discharged for misconduct connected with his work\" from benefits for a certain period of time). Azimi observes that the MDOL had reached its decision in large part because it determined that Manning's English skills were so limited as to undermine Jordan's Meats' account of the parking lot incident. Azimi argues that the MDOL's reasoning is enough to raise a material dispute of fact about the credibility of Jordan's Meats' explanation for terminating him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MDOL decision, however, does not in its conclusion or rationale help him. That decision merely found the <i>employer</i> had not \"prove[d] that [Azimi's] conduct [met] the statutory definition of misconduct.\" It did not address or find that Jordan's Meats had no reasonable basis to believe that Azimi had engaged in misconduct or even that Manning herself was not credible; in fact, the MDOL specifically noted that Manning, who was called to testify, \"testified that she felt threatened by the encounter in the parking lot.\" Nor did the MDOL even purport to address the questions of whether Azimi had been more harshly disciplined than a similarly situated employee, or, if so, whether the difference in treatment was motivated by an intent to discriminate or retaliate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, at the summary judgment stage, it is up to Azimi to produce sufficient evidence to generate a material dispute of fact that Jordan's Meats' articulated reasons for firing him were pretext. Most importantly&#8212;even if Azimi were to show that he did not, in fact, threaten Manning and, further, that Jordan's Meats knew that he did not and fired him anyway &#8212; Azimi still must produce sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that the real reason Jordan's Meats fired him was because of discrimination or retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Azimi argues that a jury could reasonably infer that Jordan's Meats was motivated by discriminatory or retaliatory animus, because he was terminated for his misconduct while other employees were disciplined more leniently for similar misbehavior. There were four types of misconduct leading up to the termination decision, according to Smith: (1) the two incidents in the parking lot with Manning; (2) lying about the Manning incident; (3) making false allegations against Adams; and (4) threatening Adams in the presence of Cram. This case does not involve, as Azimi seems to argue, only the third and fourth categories of misconduct. This case involves, in addition to those two categories, intimidating a female co-worker in a dark parking lot, threatening to spread rumors about her if she did not lie, and putting her in genuine fear. Azimi has provided no evidence of comparable misconduct and has not met his burden of providing evidence that the employment of co-workers who had committed misconduct similar to that act or that combination of acts were not also terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his statement of material facts, Azimi refers to Jordan's Meats' failure to terminate the employment of co-workers whom he accused of calling him names and using off-color or obscene language. Use of such language, not uncommon on a meat-processing plant floor, is simply not similar to the conduct in which Azimi was reported to have engaged. More serious are his claims that George Libby engaged in inappropriate roughhousing by \"grabb[ing Azimi] hard by the waist [and] thrusting his [Libby's] groin into [Azimi's] buttocks,\" and that Azimi felt threatened when another co-worker said that she was going to break his \"fucking teeth out.\" That Jordan's Meats, which investigated the incidents, concluded that neither Libby's conduct nor an angry exchange between mutually abusive co-workers was the equivalent of the behavior for which Azimi was terminated does not raise an inference of discrimination. Indeed, Jordan's Meats had reason to believe that Azimi may have been the instigator of some of these verbal and physical exchanges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, there was undisputed evidence in the summary judgment record that at least one co-worker, Libby, complained that Azimi himself had directed verbal insults and physical conduct toward Libby, which was offensive and threatening. Yet Azimi was not disciplined as a result. Libby complained to Smith that Azimi had called Libby names, such as \"fat ass\"; that Azimi also had grabbed him from behind and humped him; that Azimi had \"on many times\" tried to grab him and restrain him; and that Libby was afraid of Azimi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows that Jordan's Meats did, in fact, discipline Libby and other co-workers whom the company found to have harassed Azimi. The female co-worker who threatened to break Azimi's teeth was issued a warning; Libby was suspended for three days for his harassment of Azimi and would have been terminated if his conduct had not improved; and another co-worker, Phil Ryan, was suspended for one day for phoning Azimi and making racist comments, after Ryan said Azimi called him \"a fat ass\" and told him that he was going to \"cut his fat ass.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does Azimi offer any evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that the individuals who made the decision to terminate him&#8212;specifically, Smith and Cram&#8212;harbored any type of discriminatory or retaliatory animus toward him. That Smith, as the Human Resources Manager, and Cram, as Azimi's supervisor, dealt with some of Azimi's complaints of pre-termination harassment, is not enough to allow the inference that they terminated him because of unlawful animus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> In fact, the evidence in the record tends to show that Smith and Cram were sympathetic to many of Azimi's complaints and were trying to stamp out any discrimination at the company. For example, according to Smith's deposition, when Azimi found the note in his locker in 1999, Smith undertook an investigation. He even forwarded the note and handwriting samples to a handwriting expert, who could not identify the author. Smith then had several meetings with small groups of employees on three shifts, informed them that the letter was despicable and that such conduct would not be tolerated in the company, and distributed a memo he wrote on workplace behavior and diversity awareness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Azimi suggests that a reasonable factfinder could infer animus from the fact that he was fired within nine months of the filing of his second complaint with the MHRC and within two months after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and other targets. Nine months is simply too long a time lapse to support an inference of retaliatory animus. When Azimi has proffered no additional evidence of discriminatory animus on the part of Smith or any other decisionmaker, the fact that he was fired two months after September 11 also is not enough to generate a material dispute of fact on the unlawful discharge theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drawing all reasonable inferences in Azimi's favor, we conclude based on our review of the summary judgment record that summary judgment was warranted in relation to the unlawful discharge claims. The law does not protect the jobs of those who threaten other employees with harm, even if they themselves have been mistreated. That Azimi was wronged gave him no right to do wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment <i>affirmed.</i> Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The special verdict form and the jury's answers read as follows:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">1</a>\n        <p class=\"indent\"> Has Plaintiff, Abdul Azimi, proven by a preponderance of evidence that he was subjected to an offensive work environment that was hostile to his race, religion or ethnic origin?</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Yes <i>X</i> No ___</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">[If you answered Question 1 \"YES,\" go on to Question 2.

This appeal does not turn on that issue. Indeed, no challenge has been raised here to the jury's liability verdict, and there is no doubt that the jury reasonably found that Jordan's Meats subjected Azimi to an abusive working environment in violation of Title VII, regardless of whether Azimi demonstrated psychological injury. It is a separate question altogether, though, whether having made such a liability finding, the jury was <i>required</i> to award Azimi compensatory damages. There is nothing in <i>Harris</i> to override the ordinary rule that causation of damages must be proven to, and is the province of, the factfinder; if anything, <i>Harris</i> cuts against Azimi's argument, since it holds that a jury is entitled to find liability without necessarily finding psychological injury.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">4</a>\n        <p> Azimi was hired in November 1999 as a temporary employee and did not become a permanent employee until July 2000</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">5</a>\n        <p> Defendants suggest that the lack of an award of nominal damages may be important to the issue of whether Azimi is a prevailing party for an award of attorney's fees<i>See Farrar v.

It is clear from the context of the statement, however, that the <i>LeBlanc</i> court meant to identify <i>Kerr-Selgas</i> as a case under &#167; 1981a (which sets out the damages available under Title VII), not &#167; 1981.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Azimi points out that his complaint requested \"such further relief as deemed appropriate,\" and argues that this statement is tantamount to a timely request for nominal damages. There is nothing in this vague prayer for relief, however, that would compel the district court to award nominal damages or that would even give notice to the court that such damages were being sought. Azimi also argues that in his<i>reply</i> to defendant's opposition to his motion for a new trial, he wrote: \"[A]t a minimum, the court should award nominal damages in most cases. At the very least, the court should do so in this case.\" Even if this perfunctory statement, articulated belatedly in a reply brief rather than in the motion for a new trial, would have been enough to put the court on notice of a nominal damages claim, the nominal damages request was still untimely.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Azimi does not ask for plain error review of the nominal damages issue. Regardless, there was no plain error here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The magistrate judge's recommended decision, which was adopted by the district court, granted summary judgment on the merits of the unlawful discharge theory under Title VII, &#167; 1981, and the Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA), Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4551<i>et seq.</i> The recommended decision also held that Azimi had failed to exhaust his Title VII unlawful discharge claim, and Azimi did not challenge this determination before the district court. Thus, technically all that is before us to review are the claims under &#167; 1981 and MHRA for unlawful discharge.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Azimi vaguely suggests that defendant's evidence was not admissible,<i>Hodgens,</i> 144 F.3d at 160, because it constituted hearsay evidence. The argument is insufficiently developed, and we thus consider it waived. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990). In any event, Azimi offers no response to Jordan's Meats' rejoinder that the exhibits were business records, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Evid. 803(6), and that they and the affidavit were submitted to prove not the underlying events but the information Smith had at the time he made his decision to terminate Azimi.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Azimi does not argue that any of his harassers was involved in the decision to terminate him<i>See Medina-Munoz,</i> 896 F.2d at 10 (\"The biases of one who neither makes nor influences the challenged personnel decision are not probative in an employment discrimination case.\"). Nor does Azimi allege that this is a case like <i>Cariglia v. Hertz Equipment Rental Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200954\"><a href=\"/opinion/200954/cariglia-v-hertz-equipment/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004), in which a neutral decisionmaker is induced to act based on inaccurate information provided because of the provider's discriminatory animus. There is no claim that Manning or Adams were biased against Azimi because of his race, religion, or ethnicity. The record shows that Manning, Adams, and Azimi had a cordial relationship prior to the events of November 7, 2001.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
