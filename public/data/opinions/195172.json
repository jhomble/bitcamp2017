We  deny his  petition for review  of the  final\n\norder of deportation.\n\n                                I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          A citizen of the Dominican Republic, Cabral was allowed\n\nto enter  the United States as a resident alien on July 21, 1983.\n\nOn December 14, 1984, he was charged with murder after the Boston\n\npolice  stopped a  van containing  Cabral, two  other men,  and a\n\ncorpse wrapped  in a  carpet.   Cabral later  pled  guilty as  an\n\naccessory after the fact to murder, see  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 274,\n                                       \n\n  4  (1990),  and  received a  four-to-seven  year  prison term.1\n\nDuring the deportation  proceedings which  followed, Cabral  con-\n\ntended,  as he does  now, that the  crime of  accessory after the\n\nfact to  murder is  not a \"crime  involving moral  turpitude\" (or\n\n\"CIMT\")  within  the meaning  of  8  U.S.C.    1251(a)(4).2    An\n\nImmigration  Judge  (IJ)  found that  Cabral's  conviction  as an\n\naccessory after the  fact to the voluntary murder  charged in the\n\n                    \n\n     1No one has been convicted of the murder.\n\n     2This section was redesignated in 1990 as 8 U.S.C.   1251(a)\n(2)(A)(i)  by Pub.  L. No.  101-649   601(a),  104 Stat.  5066-85\n(1990).\n\n                                2\n\nMassachusetts indictment established that Cabral was an accessory\n\nto a  CIMT.  See In  re Sanchez-Marin, 11  I. &amp; N. Dec.  264 (BIA\n                                     \n\n1965).   The  IJ accordingly  ordered  deportation under  section\n\n1251(a)(4).  The Board of Immigration Appeals  (BIA) affirmed the\n\norder of deportation, and Cabral petitioned for review.\n\n                                II\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\nA.

We look first  to\n\nthe language of  the statute itself, employing  traditional tools\n\nof  statutory construction, see Mosquera-Perez, 3 F.3d at 554-55,\n                                              \n\nto see if  the legislative intent is clear,  Chevron U.S.A., Inc.\n                                                                 \n\nv.

We look to the legislative  history only if \"the literal\n\nwords of the statute create  ambiguity or lead to an unreasonable\n\ninterpretation.\"  United  States v. Charles George  Trucking Co.,\n                                                                \n\n823  F.2d 685,  688 (1st  Cir. 1987)  (citation omitted).   Where\n\nCongress has not spoken directly to the issue, the interpretation\n\ngiven by  the  BIA is  entitled  to deference  unless  arbitrary,\n\n                                3\n\ncapricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.  See Mosquera-\n                                                                 \n\nPerez, 3 F.3d at 555; see also Alvares-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d 1,\n                                                    \n\n3 (1st Cir.  1990).   In all  events, as the  final authority  in\n\nmatters  of  statutory interpretation,  the courts  \"'must reject\n\nadministrative constructions which are contrary to clear congres-\n\nsional intent.'\"  Mosquera-Perez,  3 F.3d. at 555  (quoting Chev-\n                                                                 \n\nron, 467 U.S. at 843 n.9).\n   \n\nB.   The Deportation Statute\n                            \n\n     (i)  The Statutory Language\n                                \n\n          Section 1251(a)(4) itself states in relevant part:\n\n          (a)  General classes.  Any alien in the Unit-\n          (a)  General classes.  \n          ed  States . . . shall, upon the order of the\n          Attorney General, be deported who    \n          . . . .\n          (4)   is convicted of a crime involving moral\n          turpitude committed  within five  years after\n          entry and either  sentenced to confinement or\n          confined therefor in  a prison or  corrective\n          institution, for a year or more. . . .\n\n8 U.S.C.   1251(a)(4).   All preconditions for  deportation under\n\nsection 1251(a)(4)  are  plainly met  in the  present case,  save\n\npossibly the CIMT requirement.   As to whether an accessory after\n\nthe fact to murder has committed a CIMT, however, the language of\n\nthe  statute is  silent.   We therefore  look to  its legislative\n\nhistory.\n\n     (ii)  The Legislative History\n                                  \n\n          The available legislative history reveals that the term\n\n\"moral  turpitude\" first appeared in the federal immigration laws\n\nin 1891.  See S. Rep. No.  1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 350 (1950);\n             \n\n                                4\n\nCharles Gordon, Immigration Law  and Practice   71.05[1][a],  71-\n                                             \n\n121 (Supp. 1993).  Justice Jackson offered the  following insight\n\ninto the legislative history of  the Immigration Act of 1917, see\n                                                                 \n\nS. Rep.  No. 352, 64th Cong., 1st Sess.  390 (1916), the first to\n\nauthorize  deportation of resident  aliens convicted of  a \"crime\n\ninvolving moral turpitude\":\n\n               The uncertainties of this statute do not\n          originate in contrariety of judicial opinion.\n          Congress knowingly conceived it in confusion.\n          During the hearings of the House Committee on\n          Immigration, out of which eventually came the\n          Act of 1917 in controversy, clear warning  of\n          its  deficiencies was  sounded and  never de-\n          nied.\n\n               \"Mr. SABATH. . . . [Y]ou  know that\n               a crime  involving moral  turpitude\n               has not  been defined.  No  one can\n               really say what  is meant by saying\n               a  crime  involving   moral  turpi-\n               tude. . . .\"\n\n               Despite  this notice,  Congress did  not\n          see  fit to state  what meaning it attributes\n          to the  phrase \"crime involving  moral turpi-\n          tude.\"\n\nJordan v.  De George, 341  U.S. 223, 233-34 (1951)  (Jackson, J.,\n                    \n\ndissenting)  (quoting  from  House Committee  on  Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Hearings on H.R.  Rep. No. 10384, 64th  Cong., 1st\n\nSess. 8  (1916)).3   The  legislative  history leaves  no  doubt,\n\n                    \n\n     3A Senate  subcommittee report accompanying  the Immigration\nAct of 1952 relating  to the exclusion  of aliens convicted of  a\nCIMT notes that the term  \"moral turpitude\" \"has not been defini-\ntively and conclusively defined by  the courts.  One INS decision\nheld that 'moral turpitude' is a  vague term. . . .\"  S. Rep. No.\n1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess.  351 (1950).  Nevertheless, the Senate\nsubcommittee  did  not adopt  the  suggestion  that  \"there be  a\nlisting  of crimes  and  circumstances  comprehended  within  the\nmeaning of moral  turpitude,\" id. at 353, so as to remove some of\n                                 \nthe interpretive discretion left to those who must apply the term\n\n                                5\n\ntherefore, that  Congress left  the term  \"crime involving  moral\n\nturpitude\" to future administrative and judicial interpretation.\n\nC.   Reasonableness of Agency Interpretation\n                                            \n\n          Although voluntary murder is  universally recognized as\n\na CIMT, see, e.g., De Lucia v.  Flagg, 297 F.2d 58, 61 (7th  Cir.\n                                     \n\n1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 837 (1962), the  statutory language\n                   \n\nand the  legislative history  are silent as  to whether  an alien\n\nconvicted as an accessory after  the fact to voluntary murder has\n\ncommitted  a  CIMT.   We  therefore  inquire  whether  the agency\n\ninterpretation  was arbitrary, capricious, or clearly contrary to\n\nthe statute.  See Mosquera-Perez, 3 F.3d at 555.\n                                \n\n          We note  first that the  record establishes, as  the IJ\n\nfound,  that  Cabral pled  guilty  as an  accessory  to voluntary\n\nmurder.   The  Massachusetts indictment,  part of  the record  of\n\nconviction, see United States ex rel. Zaffarano v. Corsi, 63 F.2d\n                                                        \n\n757, 759 (2d Cir. 1933) (per curiam) (on rehearing) (holding that\n\n\"the  record of conviction . . . mean[s] the charge (indictment),\n\nplea, verdict, and sentence\"), alleged:\n\n               JOHN DOE . . . on  or about December 14,\n          1984,  did assault  and  beat one  Nathan Lee\n          Gales,  with intent to murder him and by such\n          assault and beating  did kill and  murder the\n          said Nathan Lee Gales.

Moreover, although the term  has been part\nof our  immigration laws  for more than  100 years,  Congress has\nchosen  not to  define it,  either  in the  deportation or  alien\nexclusion contexts.  See Gordon, at 71-146 supra,   71.05[1][d].\n                                                \n\n                                6\n\n          have  committed  the  felony  aforesaid,  did\n                                                 \n          harbor, conceal, maintain and assist the said\n          John  Doe, with  intent  that  said John  Doe\n          should  avoid and  escape detention,  arrest,\n          trial and punishment.\n\n(Emphasis added.)  Under Massachusetts law, murder  is defined as\n\n\"the killing of a human  being, with malice aforethought.\"  Mass.\n\nGen. L. ch. 277,    39 (1990).4  As the IJ  noted, federal courts\n\nuniformly have held  that voluntary murder is a  CIMT, see, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nFong Haw Tan  v.

Furthermore, the  IJ reasoned,\n\n\"[i]f the underlying conduct  (assault with intent to murder  and\n\nmurder) is found to be turpitudinous,  then the secondary offense\n\n(accessory) is  also one  involving moral turpitude.

Id. at *11-*12.   The BIA distin-\n                                   \n\nguished Sanchez-Marin:  in \"that case, the [BIA] was able to look\n                     \n\nto the principals'  conviction records, as we  specifically found\n\nthat the  respondent's (alien's)   indictment linked  him to  the\n                                             \n\ncrime committed by the two principals.  [However], no linkage has\n\n                                8\n\nbeen established in this case.\"  Id. at *12 (emphasis added).\n                                    \n\n          Cabral challenges  the Sanchez-Marin  rationale itself,\n                                              \n\nnoting that accessories  before the fact under  Massachusetts law\n                               \n\nare subject to the same  punishment as the principal, whereas the\n\nlegislature has prescribed different punishments for the separate\n\ncrime of accessory after the  fact.5  Therefore, he says, whether\n                        \n\nan alien convicted as an accessory after the fact has committed a\n\nCIMT must be determined without regard to the turpitude associat-\n\ned with the primary offense committed by the principal.  Thus, he\n\nargues,  Sanchez-Marin is  wrongly decided  and the  INS may  not\n                      \n\nascribe to an alien the  moral turpitude of the principal's crime\n\nsince an accessory after the fact need have committed no \"'act of\n\nbaseness, vileness or depravity in the private  and social duties\n\nwhich a  man owes to  his fellow men,  or to society  in general,\n\ncontrary to the  accepted and  customary rule  of right. . .  ,'\"\n\nMarciano v.

Although\n\nwe recognize  the force  of the countervailing  view, we  are not\n\npersuaded  that  the  BIA's  interpretation  and  application  of\n\nsection  1251(a)(4) can  be considered  either arbitrary,  unrea-\n\nsonable or contrary to law.7\n\n          We therefore conclude that the petition for review must\n\nbe  denied, as the BIA's  interpretation of 8 U.S.C.   1251(a)(4)\n\nis not  unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious,  or manifestly  con-\n\ntrary to the statute, and its application in the present case was\n\nnot impermissible.\n\n          So Ordered.\n                    \n\n                    \n\n     7Cabral  incorrectly contends  that  Sanchez-Marin does  not\n                                                       \napply  here because  the  principal  has  never  been  convicted,\nwhereas  in Sanchez-Marin  the principals  pled  guilty.   First,\n                         \nunder  Massachusetts law, the  principal need not  have been con-\nvicted in  order to  convict an  accessory after  the fact.

Second, Cabral's guilty plea\ncollaterally estops him from denying the essential allegations of\nthe  indictment, including not only his intentional assistance to\nthe  principal but  his knowledge  that  the principal  committed\nvoluntary murder.  See Manzoli v.

On December 14, 1984, he was charged with murder after the Boston police stopped a van containing Cabral, two other men, and a corpse wrapped in a carpet.  Cabral later pled guilty as an accessory after the fact to murder, see Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 274, Sec. 4 (1990), and received a four-to-seven year prison term.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  During the deportation proceedings which followed, Cabral contended, as he does now, that the crime of accessory after the fact to murder is not a \"crime involving moral turpitude\" (or \"CIMT\") within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1251(a)(4).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  An Immigration Judge (IJ) found that Cabral's conviction as an accessory after the fact to the voluntary murder charged in the Massachusetts indictment established that Cabral was an accessory to a CIMT.  See In re Sanchez-Marin, 11 I. &amp; N.Dec. 264 (BIA1965).  The IJ accordingly ordered deportation under section 1251(a)(4).  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the order of deportation, and Cabral petitioned for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

Mosquera-Perez v. INS, 3 F.3d 553, 554 (1st Cir.1993).  See Jaramillo v. INS, 1 F.3d 1149, 1153 (11th Cir.1993);  see also INS v.

We look first to the language of the statute itself, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, see Mosquera-Perez, 3 F.3d at 554-55, to see if the legislative intent is clear, Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).

Charles George Trucking Co., 823 F.2d 685, 688 (1st Cir.1987) (citation omitted).  Where Congress has not spoken directly to the issue, the interpretation given by the BIA is entitled to deference unless arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.  See Mosquera-Perez, 3 F.3d at 555;  see also Alvares-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1990).  In all events, as the final authority in matters of statutory interpretation, the courts \" 'must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.' \"  Mosquera-Perez, 3 F.3d at 555 (quoting Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. at 2782 n. 9).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

Phelan, 162 F.2d 663, 664 (9th Cir.1947), rev'd on other grounds, 333 U.S. 6, 68 S.Ct. 374, 92 L.Ed. 433 (1948);  see also, e.g., In re Johnson, 1 Cal. 4th 689, 4 Cal.Rptr.2d 170, 822 P.2d 1317 (1992);  Burleigh v.

Furthermore, the IJ reasoned, \"[i]f the underlying conduct (assault with intent to murder and murder) is found to be turpitudinous, then the secondary offense (accessory) is also one involving moral turpitude.

Three resident aliens were convicted under Massachusetts law;  two of manslaughter, see Mass.Gen.L. ch. 265, Sec. 13 (1990), and the third as an accessory after the fact, see Mass.Gen.L. ch. 274, Sec. 4 (1990), the same \"accessory\" statute under which Cabral pled guilty.  The BIA found it \"reasonable to conclude upon the record of conviction that the homicide committed by the aliens was voluntary and consequently this crime involves moral turpitude,\" In re Sanchez-Marin, 11 I. &amp; N.Dec. at 266, and, as to the third alien, that the \"indictment links him to the manslaughter committed by the other two aliens,\" id. at 266-67 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, the BIA emphasized the significance of the \"indictment linkage,\" between the underlying crime and the accessory charge in In re Short, 1989 WL 331878, 1989 BIA LEXIS 30 (BIA Nov. 16, 1989), where an alien was charged as an accessory to the crime of assault with intent to commit an unspecified felony under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 113(b).  The IJ determined, from the indictment against the principal, that the principal's crime was a CIMT.  Thereafter, the IJ's ruling that the accessory had been convicted of a CIMT was reversed by the BIA.  Id. 1989 WL 331878, 1989 BIA LEXIS 30, at * 11-* 12.  The BIA distinguished Sanchez-Marin:  in \"that case, the [BIA] was able to look to the principals' conviction records, as we specifically found that the respondent's (alien's) indictment linked him to the crime committed by the two principals.  [However], no linkage has been established in this case.\"  Id. 1989 WL 331878, 1989 BIA LEXIS 30, at * 12 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabral challenges the Sanchez-Marin rationale itself, noting that accessories before the fact under Massachusetts law are subject to the same punishment as the principal, whereas the legislature has prescribed different punishments for the separate crime of accessory after the fact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Therefore, he says, whether an alien convicted as an accessory after the fact has committed a CIMT must be determined without regard to the turpitude associated with the primary offense committed by the principal.  Thus, he argues, Sanchez-Marin is wrongly decided and the INS may not ascribe to an alien the moral turpitude of the principal's crime since an accessory after the fact need have committed no \" 'act of baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellow men, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right ...,' \" Marciano v. INS, 450 F.2d 1022, 1025 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 997, 92 S.Ct. 1260, 31 L.Ed.2d 466 (1971) (quoting Ng Sui Wing v. United States, 46 F.2d 755, 756 (7th Cir.1931)).  Although Cabral correctly asserts that Sanchez-Marin is \"presumptive ... and bereft of any reasoning or analysis\" supporting its conclusion, we do not agree that the BIA's interpretation of section 1251(a)(4) can be ruled unreasonable, arbitrary, or contrary to law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For present purposes, we accept arguendo the premise that the CIMT determination may take into account only the moral turpitude involved in the criminal conduct to which Cabral pled guilty as determined from the record of conviction,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> including the indictment, see Zaffarano, 63 F.2d at 759.   Even so, the BIA found moral turpitude based on the indictment to which Cabral pled guilty, not the indictment against John Doe.  See supra at p. 6;  see also Sanchez-Marin, 11 I. &amp; N.Dec. at 266-67.  Given Cabral's guilty plea to an indictment alleging that he knew that the principal intentionally murdered another human being and that Cabral intentionally assisted the principal in avoiding detention, trial and punishment, we discern nothing arbitrary, unreasonable, or contrary to law in the BIA's determination that Cabral himself committed a \"crime involving moral turpitude.\"   See Marciano, 450 F.2d at 1025.   To state the question in the context presented is to answer it:  Is it unreasonable for the executive agency entrusted by Congress with primary responsibility for the administration of the deportation of resident aliens to find that an alien who knowingly assisted the perpetrator of a brutal murder to avoid detention, trial and punishment, has himself committed a \"crime involving moral turpitude\"?   Although we recognize the force of the countervailing view, we are not persuaded that the BIA's interpretation and application of section 1251(a)(4) can be considered either arbitrary, unreasonable or contrary to law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that the petition for review must be denied, as the BIA's interpretation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1251(a)(4) is not unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute, and its application in the present case was not impermissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So Ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> No one has been convicted of the murder</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This section was redesignated in 1990 as 8 U.S.C.

Nevertheless, the Senate subcommittee did not adopt the suggestion that \"there be a listing of crimes and circumstances comprehended within the meaning of moral turpitude,\" id. at 353, so as to remove some of the interpretive discretion left to those who must apply the term in excluding aliens.  Moreover, although the term has been part of our immigration laws for more than 100 years, Congress has chosen not to define it, either in the deportation or alien exclusion contexts.

The relevant distinction, for purposes of the CIMT classification, is between voluntary and involuntary killing, rather than murder and manslaughter.  See De Lucia, 297 F.2d at 61 (\"so long as homicide is voluntary ... no amount of justification can remove it from the class of [CIMTs]\").  Thus, Cabral pled guilty as an accessory after the fact to voluntary murder, a CIMT</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Of course, the definition of a CIMT under Sec. 1251(a)(4) is a matter of federal law.

First, under Massachusetts law, the principal need not have been convicted in order to convict an accessory after the fact.  See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 274, Sec. 5 (1990).  Second, Cabral's guilty plea collaterally estops him from denying the essential allegations of the indictment, including not only his intentional assistance to the principal but his knowledge that the principal committed voluntary murder.  See Manzoli v. Commissioner, 904 F.2d 101, 105 (1st Cir.1990) (party to civil action collaterally estopped from relitigating material issue resolved against him in prior criminal action).  As the IJ observed, proof that the underlying murder was committed would have been essential had Cabral gone to trial.  See Commonwealth v.

Cabral later pled guilty as an accessory after the fact to murder, see Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 274, Sec. 4 (1990), and received a four-to-seven year prison term.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  During the deportation proceedings which followed, Cabral contended, as he does now, that the crime of accessory after the fact to murder is not a \"crime involving moral turpitude\" (or \"CIMT\") within the meaning of 8 U.S.C.

The BIA found it \"reasonable to conclude upon the record of conviction that the homicide committed by the aliens was voluntary and consequently this crime involves moral turpitude,\" In re Sanchez-Marin, 11 I. &amp; N.Dec. at 266, and, as to the third alien, that the \"indictment links him to the manslaughter committed by the other two aliens,\" id. at 266-67 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, the BIA emphasized the significance of the \"indictment linkage,\" between the underlying crime and the accessory charge in In re Short, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">331878</span></span>, 1989 BIA LEXIS 30 (BIA Nov. 16, 1989), where an alien was charged as an accessory to the crime of assault with intent to commit an unspecified felony under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 113(b).  The IJ determined, from the indictment against the principal, that the principal's crime was a CIMT.  Thereafter, the IJ's ruling that the accessory had been convicted of a CIMT was reversed by the BIA.

The BIA distinguished Sanchez-Marin:  in \"that case, the [BIA] was able to look to the principals' conviction records, as we specifically found that the respondent's (alien's) indictment linked him to the crime committed by the two principals.

Thus, he argues, Sanchez-Marin is wrongly decided and the INS may not ascribe to an alien the moral turpitude of the principal's crime since an accessory after the fact need have committed no \" 'act of baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellow men, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right ...,' \" Marciano v.

Although Cabral correctly asserts that Sanchez-Marin is \"presumptive ... and bereft of any reasoning or analysis\" supporting its conclusion, we do not agree that the BIA's interpretation of section 1251(a)(4) can be ruled unreasonable, arbitrary, or contrary to law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For present purposes, we accept arguendo the premise that the CIMT determination may take into account only the moral turpitude involved in the criminal conduct to which Cabral pled guilty as determined from the record of conviction,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> including the indictment, see Zaffarano, 63 F.2d at 759.   Even so, the BIA found moral turpitude based on the indictment to which Cabral pled guilty, not the indictment against John Doe.  See supra at p. 6;  see also Sanchez-Marin, 11 I. &amp; N.Dec. at 266-67.  Given Cabral's guilty plea to an indictment alleging that he knew that the principal intentionally murdered another human being and that Cabral intentionally assisted the principal in avoiding detention, trial and punishment, we discern nothing arbitrary, unreasonable, or contrary to law in the BIA's determination that Cabral himself committed a \"crime involving moral turpitude.\"   See Marciano, 450 F.2d at 1025.   To state the question in the context presented is to answer it:  Is it unreasonable for the executive agency entrusted by Congress with primary responsibility for the administration of the deportation of resident aliens to find that an alien who knowingly assisted the perpetrator of a brutal murder to avoid detention, trial and punishment, has himself committed a \"crime involving moral turpitude\"?   Although we recognize the force of the countervailing view, we are not persuaded that the BIA's interpretation and application of section 1251(a)(4) can be considered either arbitrary, unreasonable or contrary to law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that the petition for review must be denied, as the BIA's interpretation of 8 U.S.C.

Nevertheless, the Senate subcommittee did not adopt the suggestion that \"there be a listing of crimes and circumstances comprehended within the meaning of moral turpitude,\" id. at 353, so as to remove some of the interpretive discretion left to those who must apply the term in excluding aliens.  Moreover, although the term has been part of our immigration laws for more than 100 years, Congress has chosen not to define it, either in the deportation or alien exclusion contexts.

The relevant distinction, for purposes of the CIMT classification, is between voluntary and involuntary killing, rather than murder and manslaughter.  See De Lucia, 297 F.2d at 61 (\"so long as homicide is voluntary ... no amount of justification can remove it from the class of [CIMTs]\").
