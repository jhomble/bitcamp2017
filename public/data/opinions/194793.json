We\n\nconclude  that, although  the  Constitution  does not  altogether\n\nproscribe  the use  of  such anticipatory  warrants, the  warrant\n\nemployed  here  was  constitutionally  infirm.    We,  therefore,\n\nreverse.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          In 1988,  Houston police breathed life  into a moribund\n\nchild   pornography  investigation   by  giving   federal  postal\n\ninspectors a customer  list unearthed  during a 1975  probe of  a\n\nsuspected pornography distributor.  Appellant's  name appeared on\n\nthe  list.     The  postal  inspectors   subsequently  spawned  a\n\nfictitious \"front\" company,  Globe-Tex Specialties, and  targeted\n\nRicciardelli   in   a  sting   operation.     After   preliminary\n\ncorrespondence elicited  interest on Ricciardelli's  part, Globe-\n\nTex  sent him a catalog from which he ordered several videotapes.\n\nGlobe-Tex  notified  him  that  only  one  tape  was  immediately\n\navailable and promised to mail it forthwith.\n\n          On the day prior to the  scheduled delivery, the postal\n\ninspectors applied for,  and a magistrate judge issued,  a search\n\n                                2\n\nwarrant.   The  warrant  authorized the  investigators to  search\n\nappellant's residence for, inter alia, correspondence, documents,\n                                     \n\nand  objects related  to  contacts with  either Globe-Tex  or the\n\nHouston pornography  dealer.   By its  express terms, the  search\n\nwarrant would \"not be  effective until after delivery by  mail to\n\nand  receipt by  Steven  L. Ricciardelli  of  the .  . .  package\n\ncontaining the videotape.\"\n\n          The day after the warrant was issued, postal inspectors\n\ngave  the package  containing  the videotape  to  the local  post\n\noffice  for delivery.  A  return receipt, affixed  to the parcel,\n\nrequired that appellant sign for it.  The letter carrier tried to\n\ndeliver  the  package  that  day  but  appellant  was  not  home.\n\nFollowing standard  practice, the  postman left  a notice on  the\n\npremises indicating that appellant could collect the  item at the\n\npost office.  That afternoon, appellant retrieved the package and\n\nreturned  to  his  home.    About thirty  minutes  later,  postal\n\ninspectors executed the  warrant, recovering the videotape,  some\n\ncorrespondence, and  a number  of other  films and  magazines not\n\nmentioned in the warrant.\n\n          Appellant was indicted.   The district  court summarily\n\ndenied  his motion  to  suppress the  materials  seized from  his\n\ndwelling.   Subsequently, appellant  stipulated to  the pertinent\n\nfacts and the judge found him guilty.  This appeal ensued.\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\n\n          We  divide our analysis of this case into segments.  We\n\nfirst  discuss  the  constitutionality  of   anticipatory  search\n\n                                3\n\nwarrants  as  a  general matter.    We  then  turn to  specifics,\n\ndiscussing certain  alleged deficiencies in the  warrant obtained\n\nby  the postal inspectors.  We end by addressing the government's\n\ncontentions  that  appellant's submissiveness  and/or  the postal\n\ninspectors' good faith palliated any defects in the warrant.\n\n                A.  Anticipatory Search Warrants.\n                                                \n\n          At the  outset, appellant  seeks to bowl  a ten-strike:\n\nhe  asks us to  rule that so-called  anticipatory search warrants\n\nare  per  se  unconstitutional.   This  initiative  presents    a\n            \n\nquestion of first impression in this circuit.1\n\n          Anticipatory  search warrants are  peculiar to property\n\nin transit.   Such warrants provide a solution  to a dilemma that\n\nhas long vexed  law enforcement  agencies:  whether,  on the  one\n\nhand,  to allow the delivery of contraband to be completed before\n\nobtaining  a  search warrant,  thus  risking  the destruction  or\n\ndispersement  of  evidence in  the ensuing  interval, or,  on the\n\nother hand,  seizing  the contraband  on  its arrival  without  a\n\nwarrant,  thus  risking  suppression.    Anticipatory warrants   \n\nwarrants  that are issued in advance of the receipt of particular\n\nproperty  at the premises designated  in the warrant2    strike a\n\n                    \n\n     1We  cannot escape  this issue  for, if  anticipatory search\nwarrants are valid at all, the rules pertaining to their issuance\nwill necessarily  determine the legal sufficiency  of the warrant\nobtained in this case.\n\n     2To be sure, an anticipatory  warrant can be directed toward\nthe  search of  a  person  instead  of  a place.    For  ease  in\nreference, however, we speak  throughout this opinion of searches\nof  places rather than of persons (although we note that the same\nprinciples apply in either case).\n\n                                4\n\nthird  chord,  protecting  privacy rights  by  requiring  advance\n\njudicial  approval  of  a  planned  search  while  simultaneously\n\nsatisfying legitimate  law enforcement needs.   See United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Garcia, 882 F.2d 699,  703 (2d Cir.),  cert. denied, 493 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n943 (1989); see also 2 Wayne LaFave, Search and Seizure   3.7(c),\n                                                       \n\nat 97 (1987).\n\n          Appellant's  constitutional challenge  to  the  use  of\n\nanticipatory  warrants proceeds  under  the aegis  of the  Fourth\n\nAmendment.   His  theory  is epibolic.    First, he  remarks  the\n\nobvious    that  a warrant  can  issue only  \"upon  a showing  of\n\nprobable cause,\" U.S. Const.  Amend. IV   and interprets  this as\n\nrequiring probable  cause to believe  that the  contraband to  be\n\nseized  is in  the place  to be  searched at  the time  a warrant\n\nissues.   He then erects a second proposition on this problematic\n\npedestal,   professing   that   a    magistrate   can   have   no\n\nconstitutionally sufficient basis for issuing a warrant at a time\n\nwhen the contraband is  elsewhere and, presumably, probable cause\n\ndoes not exist.  In our view, appellant's theory misconstrues the\n\nmeaning of probable cause.\n\n          The probable  cause doctrine does not  require that the\n\ncontraband to be seized must presently be located at the premises\n\nto be searched, only that there is probable cause to believe that\n\na crime  has been (or is being) committed and that evidence of it\n\ncan likely  be found at  the described locus  at the time  of the\n                                                                 \n\nsearch.  See United States v. Aguirre, 839  F.2d 854, 857-58 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1987).  \"Probability is the touchstone [of probable cause] .\n\n                                5\n\n. . .\"   United States v. Figueroa, 818 F.2d 1020, 1023 (1st Cir.\n                                  \n\n1987) (collecting cases).   In the stereotypical  case, an item's\n\ncurrent location creates  a probability  that it will  be at  the\n\nsame  location when  the search  is executed    but there  are no\n\nguarantees.   The suspect  might move  or destroy  the contraband\n\nbefore the warrant  is executed.   Nevertheless, so  long as  the\n\nrequisite probability exists, the  possibility that things  might\n                                              \n\ngo awry does not forestall the issuance of a warrant.  After all,\n\n\"[p]robable  cause  need not  be  tantamount  to proof  beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"   United  States  v. Hoffman,  832 F.2d  1299,\n                                               \n\n1305-06  (1st Cir. 1987); accord Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213,\n                                                  \n\n238 (1983) (requiring \"a  fair probability that contraband .  . .\n\nwill be found in a particular place\"); United States v. Caggiano,\n                                                                \n\n899 F.2d 99, 102 (1st Cir. 1990) (collecting cases).\n\n          Seen from this perspective,  it is difficult to discern\n\nthe constitutional objection to an anticipatory warrant.  In many\n\ncases, the facts put forward in support of an anticipatory search\n\nwarrant predicated  on the  planned delivery  of contraband  to a\n\nparticular  location  establish  a  greater  likelihood  that the\n\ncontraband will  be found there at the  time of the search (which\n\nwill be  contemporaneous with the  arrival of the  contraband, or\n\nnearly  so)  than do  facts  put  forward in  support  of  a more\n\nconventional  search  warrant  predicated  on  the  known  recent\n\nlocation of  contraband at the  proposed search site.   Moreover,\n\nthe  method  of  the  Fourth  Amendment    inserting  a  neutral,\n\ndetached judicial officer as a buffer between a citizen's privacy\n\n                                6\n\nrights and  potential government overreaching    works equally as\n\nwell  in  connection  with  anticipatory  warrants.    In  either\n\ninstance, contemporary  or anticipatory,  the focal point  of the\n\nmagistrate's inquiry is  whether there is probable cause to think\n\nthat the  contraband will be at  the place to be  searched at the\n\ntime of  the contemplated intrusion.   That the  event justifying\n\nthe  intrusion  has  not  yet  occurred   does  not  distort  the\n\ndecisionmaking process.  Rather, the magistrate must simply widen\n\nhis  horizons  to  take  into account  the  likelihood  that  the\n\ntriggering  event  will occur  on  schedule and  as  predicted in\n\nmaking his probable cause determination.3\n\n          Mindful   of   these   considerations,   we   find   it\n\nunsurprising that  every circuit  to have addressed  the question\n\nhas held that anticipatory  search warrants are not categorically\n\nunconstitutional.   See,  e.g., United  States v.  Tagbering, 985\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 946, 950  (8th Cir. 1993); United States v.

Such a  warrant can  appropriately  be viewed  as an\nanticipatory warrant  for the seizure  of words:   the magistrate\nissues the warrant on the basis of a substantial probability that\ncrime-related  conversations will ensue.   Clearly, such warrants\nare permitted under  the Fourth  Amendment.  See  Katz v.  United\n                                                                 \nStates, 389 U.S. 347, 354-55 (1967); Berger v. New York, 388 U.S.\n                                                       \n41, 63 (1967).\n\n                                7\n\nrel.  Beal v. Skaff,  418 F.2d 430,  432-33 (7th Cir.  1969); see\n                                                                 \n\nalso United States  v. Nixon,  918 F.2d 895,  903 n.6 (11th  Cir.\n                            \n\n1990)  (dictum).    We, too,  believe  that  there  is no  Fourth\n\nAmendment infirmity indigenous to anticipatory search  warrants  \n\nalthough  such warrants must,  of course, be  issued under proper\n\ncircumstances, upon a proper showing, and with proper safeguards.\n\nWe hold, therefore, that  when law enforcement personnel  offer a\n\nmagistrate  reliable,  independent  evidence  indicating  that  a\n\ndelivery of  contraband will  very likely  occur at  a particular\n\nplace, and when the magistrate conditions the warrant's execution\n\nfor the search  of that place on  that delivery, the warrant,  if\n\nnot  overbroad  or  otherwise  defective,  passes  constitutional\n\nmuster.  That the  contraband has not yet reached the premises to\n\nbe  searched  at  the   time  the  warrant  issues  is   not,  in\n\nconstitutional terms, an insuperable obstacle.\n\n                    B.  Exigent Circumstances.\n                                             \n\n          Appellant  next  suggests  that,  even  if anticipatory\n\nwarrants are  not invalid per se,  their use must  be confined to\n                                \n\ncircumstances  in which time is of the essence, e.g., drug cases,\n                                                    \n\nwhere  a significant danger lurks that the evidence might be lost\n\nif  the search  is not  made in  close temporal proximity  to the\n\ncontraband's  delivery.   We disagree:   the  absence  of exigent\n\ncircumstances   and the government readily concedes that none are\n\npresent  here     does not  outlaw  the  use  of an  anticipatory\n\nwarrant.\n\n          We  need  not  linger.   The  Eighth  Circuit  recently\n\n                                8\n\nrejected this  precise argument.  In Tagbering,  the court stated\n                                              \n\nthat  the  presence  or   absence  of  exigent  circumstances  is\n\nirrelevant in determining whether an  anticipatory search warrant\n\nshould issue.  See Tagbering, 985 F.2d at 950 n.6.  We share this\n                            \n\nview.  Where the probable  cause requirement for an  anticipatory\n\nsearch warrant has been  fulfilled, there is no necessity  for an\n\nindependent showing of exigent  circumstances.  Cf. United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Panitz, 907 F.2d 1267, 1270 (1st Cir. 1990) (reiterating that\n          \n\nwhere  a  vehicle  search  is supported  by  probable  cause,  no\n\nexigency need exist to justify warrantless search).\n\n          The  logic  behind  this  conclusion  is  inescapable.4\n\nProbable cause is probable cause; the justification for  a search\n\ndoes not vanish  merely because the  circumstances are such  that\n\nthe  evidence could have  been obtained  through a  more familiar\n\nmethod.

See  Tagbering, 985  F.2d at 950  n.6;\n                                         \nPanitz,  907 F.2d at 1270  &amp; n.3.  The other  side of the coin is\n      \nequally revealing:   exigent circumstances will  rarely, if ever,\nbe present  in child pornography  cases, as history  teaches that\ncollectors  prefer  not  to  dispose of  their  dross,  typically\nretaining obscene materials for years.\n\n                                9\n\npornography investigations than in  drug investigations to obtain\n\na conventional search warrant  does not cheapen the value  of the\n\nmagistrate's initial probable cause determination  and, thus, \"is\n\nnot dispositive of any relevant issue.\"  Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1271\n                                               \n\nn.3.  Consequently, we hold that an  otherwise valid anticipatory\n\nwarrant does not fail merely because the officers might have lost\n\nnothing by waiting until  the delivery had been  completed before\n\nobtaining a warrant.\n\n                        C.  Definiteness.\n                                        \n\n          We  now reach the crux  of the suppression  issue:  Was\n\nthe  warrant  fatally defective  because  it  failed to  forge  a\n\nsufficient  link between  the  arrival of  the videotape  and the\n\nproposed search of appellant's abode?  We think that it was.\n\n          Although   anticipatory   search   warrants   are   not\n\nconstitutionally  foreclosed, see  supra  Part  II(A), a  warrant\n                                        \n\nconditioned  on  a future  event presents  a potential  for abuse\n\nabove  and beyond that which exists in more traditional settings:\n\ninevitably,  the executing  agents are  called upon  to determine\n\nwhen and whether  the triggering event  specified in the  warrant\n\nhas actually  occurred.  Consequently, magistrates  who are asked\n\nto issue such warrants must be particularly vigilant  in ensuring\n\nthat the  opportunities for exercising unfettered  discretion are\n\neliminated.  To satisfy these  concerns, the magistrate must  set\n\nconditions governing an anticipatory warrant  that are \"explicit,\n\nclear,  and  narrowly drawn  so as  to avoid  misunderstanding or\n\nmanipulation  by government agents.\"  Garcia, 882 F.2d at 703-04;\n                                            \n\n                                10\n\naccord Tagbering, 985 F.2d at 950.\n                \n\n          There   are   two   particular   dimensions   in  which\n\nanticipatory  warrants  must limit  the discretion  of government\n\nagents.  First,  the magistrate must  ensure that the  triggering\n\nevent is both ascertainable and preordained.   The warrant should\n\nrestrict the officers' discretion  in detecting the occurrence of\n\nthe event to almost ministerial proportions,  similar to a search\n\nparty's  discretion in locating the  place to be  searched.  Only\n\nthen,  in the prototypical case, are the ends of explicitness and\n\nclarity served.   Second,  the contraband must  be on a  sure and\n\nirreversible course  to its destination,  and a future  search of\n\nthe  destination  must  be  made expressly  contingent  upon  the\n\ncontraband's arrival  there.  Under such  circumstances, a number\n\nof  courts have found  anticipatory search warrants  to be valid.\n\nSee,  e.g.,  Nixon,  918  F.2d  at  903  n.6;  United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nDornhofer, 859 F.2d 1195, 1198 (4th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 490\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 1005 (1989); Goodwin, 854 F.2d at 36; United States v. Hale,\n                                                                \n\n784 F.2d 1465,  1468-69 (9th  Cir.), cert. denied,  479 U.S.  829\n                                                 \n\n(1986);  Goff,  681  F.2d  at  1240.   We  adopt  the  \"sure  and\n             \n\nirreversible course\" standard as a  means of judging the validity\n\nof anticipatory warrants.  \n\n          It  is at this juncture,  however, that we part company\n\nwith the government.   The  sure course standard  functions as  a\n\nproxy  for the actual presence of the  contraband at the locus to\n\nbe searched.   It offers the  magistrate a trustworthy  assurance\n\nthat  the contraband,  though not  yet on  the site,  will almost\n\n                                11\n\ncertainly  be located  there  at the  time  of the  search,  thus\n\nfulfilling the requirement of future  probable cause.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nHale, 784 F.2d at  1468 (finding a warrant for  child pornography\n    \n\nthat was to  be delivered to  defendant at his home  to be \"on  a\n\nsure  course to its  destination\" and,  hence, valid);  Goff, 681\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 1240 (finding the requirement met where defendant boarded\n\nan airplane and agents then  procured a warrant to search  him at\n\nthe flight's terminus).  Implicit   in   this  standard   is  the\n\nrecognition that the evidence must  be on an ascertainable course\n\nso that  the event  on which the  warrant is conditioned  bears a\n\ndefinite relationship to  the premises  to be searched.   It  is,\n\nmoreover,  imperative that  the warrant  establish not  only this\n\nkind of tri-cornered nexus between the criminal act, the evidence\n\nto  be seized, and  the place to  be searched, but  also that the\n\nnexus incorporate  a temporal  dimension.  The  important privacy\n\ninterests  protected by  the Fourth  Amendment make  it incumbent\n\nupon  the magistrate to  craft the warrant  with explicit, clear,\n\nand narrowly  drawn conditions governing its  execution to ensure\n\nthat  the anticipated nexus will  actually exist if  and when the\n\nwarrant  is  executed.    Phrased another  way,  the  event  that\n\ntriggers the search must be the delivery of the contraband to the\n                                                                 \n\npremises to be searched, thereby leaving as little as possible to\n                       \n\nthe discretion of the agent executing the warrant.  See 2 LaFave,\n                                                       \n\nsupra   3.7(d), at 101-02.\n     \n\n          The instant warrant imposed no such  strict conditions.\n\nTo  the contrary, it overlooked  (or, at least,  did not address)\n\n                                12\n\nthe need for  establishing a nexus  between the triggering  event\n\nand the place  to be  searched.  Here,  the warrant authorized  a\n\nsearch  not of appellant's person  but of his  home, for evidence\n\nrelating to  his  dealings with  child pornography  distributors.\n\nThe  search was  to be  triggered by  delivery of  the videotape.\n\nThus,  the very premise on which  the warrant rested was that the\n\nvideotape's arrival would signal  the existence of probable cause\n\nto believe that evidence of  a crime   the videotape itself    as\n\nwell as  evidence of  criminal predisposition or  other nefarious\n\nactivity was likely located in the dwelling.  The warrant's text,\n\nhowever, completely  ignored  this connection,  conditioning  the\n\nsearch not  on the arrival  of the videotape  at the place  to be\n\nsearched,  but, rather,  on appellant's  personal receipt  of the\n\nvideotape,  wherever he might be  and wherever he  might take his\n\nprize.  By the terms of the warrant, once appellant retrieved the\n\npackage  at  the post  office, the  postal inspectors  could have\n\nsearched  his   abode  whether  or  not   appellant  brought  the\n\ncontraband there.  An anticipatory search warrant that cedes such\n\ngreat  discretion  to  the  executing  agents  cannot   withstand\n\nconstitutional scrutiny.\n\n          In  United States v. Hendricks, 743  F.2d 653 (9th Cir.\n                                        \n\n1985),  cert. denied,  470 U.S.  1006 (1986),  the  Ninth Circuit\n                    \n\ngrappled with an almost  identical nexus problem when considering\n\nthe  validity  of  an anticipatory  warrant.    There,  a package\n\ncontaining  contraband  was  shipped   in  a  way  that  required\n\ndefendant to pick  up the package personally, rather  than merely\n\n                                13\n\nhaving it delivered to  his home.  See  id. at 653.  Even  though\n                                           \n\nthe  contraband actually  arrived at  defendant's residence,  the\n\nNinth  Circuit invalidated  the  warrant on  the  ground that  it\n\nfailed to forge the requisite link between the described premises\n\nand the  illegal activity.  See  id. at 655.   The court reasoned\n                                    \n\nthat,  although the  warrant  listed a  specific  location to  be\n\nsearched,  once the box was picked up any number of circumstances\n\nmight intervene to snuff  out a future connection between  it and\n\nthe premises.  See id. at 654-55.\n                      \n\n          The  case  at  hand  parallels Hendricks  in  important\n                                                  \n\nrespects.5  Here,  as in Hendricks, the  package, once retrieved,\n                                  \n\ncould  have  been taken  anywhere.   Here,  as in  Hendricks, the\n                                                            \n\nconditions governing  the execution  of  the anticipatory  search\n\nwarrant  were  extremely susceptible  to  the  discretion of  the\n\nexecuting officers.  Here,  as in Hendricks, the warrant  was too\n                                           \n\nbroadly drawn in  that it did not ensure that  the contraband was\n\non a sure  course to the  premises to be searched.   Here, as  in\n\nHendricks,  even  though  the  defendant  happened  to  take  the\n         \n\ncontraband home, the warrant did not establish an adequate three-\n\nway  nexus between  the  criminal activity,  the  evidence to  be\n\nseized, and the premises.  It follows inexorably that here, as in\n\nHendricks, the search warrant was invalid.\n         \n\n          Nor can we read  the warrant as treating the  search of\n\n                    \n\n     5To be sure, the case at hand differs  from Hendricks in the\n                                                          \nrespect  that, here, the authorities made  an abortive attempt to\ndeliver the package directly to the defendant's residence.  We do\nnot consider this distinction to possess decretory significance.\n\n                                14\n\nappellant's  abode as an event  separate from his  receipt of the\n\nvideotape.  The affidavit supporting the warrant bases the postal\n\ninspector's  conclusions anent  probable  cause upon  appellant's\n\nfuture receipt of the videotape at his home.  What is more, it is\n\nthe triggering condition of  appellant's receipt of the videotape\n\nat  home  that eliminates  alternative  possibilities, say,  that\n\nappellant  was a  runner  for some  other  person, or  simply  an\n\ninternuncio,  thereby producing  probable cause  to believe  that\n\nappellant is  a collector of  child pornography and,  hence, that\n\nhis residence likely contains evidence of his criminality.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., id. at 654 (invalidating warrant where triggering event was\n         \n\nnot  certain  and  independent  probable cause  did  not  exist).\n\nTherefore, unless the search  can be saved on some  other theory,\n\nan inquiry to which we now turn, the fruits of the search must be\n\nsuppressed.6\n\n                           D.  Consent.\n                                      \n\n          The government asseverates  that any  infirmity in  the\n\nsearch warrant  was assuaged  by appellant's supposed  consent to\n\nthe  postal inspectors' seizure of the videotape.  We reject this\n\n                    \n\n     6Our  concurring brother  takes  the view  that the  warrant\ncannot stand because it  was based in part on  stale information.\nSee, e.g., United  States v.  Bucuvalas, 970 F.2d  937, 940  (1st\n                                       \nCir. 1992) (discussing criteria for reliability of information on\nwhich probable  cause determination is based),  cert. denied, 113\n                                                            \nS. Ct. 1382 (1993).   We find  this proposition troubling, as  it\noverlooks  the   undeniable  fact  that,  in   addition  to  what\ntranspired in the past,  the affidavit also contains ample  \"non-\nstale\" information  concerning  appellant's ordering  of  illicit\nmaterials  from  Globe-Tex  shortly  before  the  search  warrant\nissued.   In any event, given our  conclusion that the warrant is\nvoid  for  indefiniteness,  we  need not  resolve  the  staleness\nquestion.\n\n                                15\n\nasseveration  on three grounds.   In the first  place, the record\n\ndiscloses  no  finding  by  the  district  court  that  appellant\n\nconsented to a  seizure.   Second, even if  appellant voiced  his\n\nconsent,  a court could not  plausibly find such  consent to have\n\nbeen  voluntary   in  the   atmosphere  created  by   the  postal\n\ninspectors' execution  of the invalid warrant.  See, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Maragh, 894 F.2d 415, 419-20 (D.C. Cir.) (finding that\n                 \n\nconsent does  not cure  an unlawful seizure),  cert. denied,  498\n                                                           \n\nU.S. 880  (1990); see also United States  v. Twomey, 884 F.2d 46,\n                                                   \n\n50-51   (1st   Cir.  1989)   (identifying  criteria   helpful  in\n\ndetermining voluntariness of consent), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 908\n                                                   \n\n(1990).  Once appellant  was led down the garden  path, persuaded\n\nthat the search warrant  was unimpugnable, his subsequent consent\n\nmust  be viewed as  merely an  accommodation to  the authorities.\n\nSee Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 497 (1983); Lo-Ji Sales, Inc.\n                                                                 \n\nv. New York, 442 U.S. 319, 329 (1979).  At any  rate, the consent\n           \n\nissue  is  academic  because,  as the  government  concedes,  the\n\nvideotape was within  the perimeter of the  search warrant (which\n\nprovided for the  seizure of all  \"objects\" related to  Globe-Tex\n\nSpecialties).  Inasmuch as the videotape is an immediate fruit of\n\nan  invalid search warrant, it must be suppressed.7  See Illinois\n                                                                 \n\nv. Rodriguez, 110 S. Ct. 2793, 2799 (1990).\n            \n\n                    \n\n     7We  need not  consider  the effect  of appellant's  alleged\nconsent on  the suppression of  magazines and other  detritus not\nencompassed by the search warrant.   The short, conclusive answer\nin regard  to such items is  that the government did  not seek to\nuse them against appellant or introduce them into evidence at the\ntrial.   Any controversy  anent such items  is, therefore,  moot.\nSee, e.g., Smith v. INS, 585 F.2d 600, 602 (3d Cir. 1978).\n                       \n\n                                16\n\n                         E.  Good Faith.\n                                       \n\n          The government strains to persuade us that, even if the\n\nwarrant self-destructs,  the evidence seized can  be used against\n\nRicciardelli under  the good faith exception  to the exclusionary\n\nrule.  We are not convinced.\n\n          In United  States v.  Leon, 468  U.S.  897 (1984),  the\n                                    \n\nSupreme Court explained that the exclusionary rule is a deterrent\n\nmeasure designed to ensure  compliance with the Fourth Amendment.\n\nSee id. at 906.  The Court  believed that there would often be no\n       \n\ndeterrence when police  obtain evidence in  reliance on a  search\n\nwarrant that is subsequently found to be defective; \"in most such\n\ncases,  there is no police illegality and thus nothing to deter.\"\n\nId.  at 921.   Hence,  exclusion of  seized evidence  under those\n   \n\nconditions  serves no  salutary  purpose  because  that  sanction\n\n\"cannot  logically   contribute  to  the  deterrence   of  Fourth\n\nAmendment violations.\"  Id.\n                           \n\n          Although weakening the exclusionary rule, the Court did\n\nnot defenestrate it.   The Justices acknowledged that suppression\n\nwould   continue  to   be   appropriate  in   situations   where,\n\nnotwithstanding the  issuance of a warrant,  \"the law enforcement\n\nofficer had knowledge, or may properly be charged with knowledge,\n\nthat the search was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.\"\n\nId. at 919.   Thus, to cite  two instances, suppression would  be\n   \n\nproper where  the \"warrant  [is] .  . .  so facially deficient   \n\ni.e., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the\n    \n\nthings  to  be  seized     that  the  executing  officers  cannot\n\n                                17\n\nreasonably presume it to be valid,\" or the warrant is \"so lacking\n\nin indicia of probable  cause as to render official belief in its\n\nexistence  entirely  unreasonable.\"   Id.  at  923 (citation  and\n                                         \n\ninternal quotation  marks omitted).   If, however,  the warrant's\n\ndefectiveness   results   from   mere   technical   errors,   see\n                                                                 \n\nMassachusetts  v.

See 1 LaFave, supra   1.2(d), at 38\n                                                 \n\n(explaining that  searching officer's erroneous  understanding of\n\nFourth Amendment limits on his power  still presents a compelling\n\ncase for exclusion).\n\n                                18\n\n          After Leon, how does a court tell whether a defect in a\n                    \n\nwarrant is  fatal?  In  determining whether a  reasonable officer\n\nshould  have   known  that  a   search  was  illegal   despite  a\n\nmagistrate's  authorization,  a  court  must  evaluate   all  the\n\nattendant circumstances, see Leon, 468 U.S. at 922 n.23; Earle v.\n                                                              \n\nBenoit,  850 F.2d 836, 848 (1st  Cir. 1988), keeping in mind that\n      \n\nLeon requires not  merely good faith,  but objective good  faith.\n    \n\nSee United States v. Curzi, 867 F.2d 36, 44 (1st Cir. 1989).  And\n                          \n\nwhen, as now, a government agent asserts good faith reliance on a\n\nmagistrate's decision to  issue a warrant,  the court must  focus\n\nupon the existence vel non of objective good faith at the time of\n                          \n\nthe warrant application.   See  Malley v. Briggs,  475 U.S.  335,\n                                                \n\n344-45 (1986); Earle, 850 F.2d at 848.\n                    \n\n          Here, the government fails both parts of the good faith\n\ntest.   After studying the record on appeal, we conclude that the\n\nwarrant,  as  issued,  contained  non-technical  defects  readily\n\nobservable to experienced  postal inspectors and, moreover,  that\n\nthe  inspectors'  omissions  in the  warrant-application  process\n\nconstituted  a  second,   independently  sufficient  ground   for\n\ndistinguishing this  case from  Leon.  Accordingly,  the evidence\n                                    \n\nseized  under the  anticipatory warrant  and introduced  at trial\n\nshould have been suppressed.\n\n          In connection  with  the first  prong of  the test,  we\n\nfind, without serious question, that the defects on the warrant's\n\nface were apparent enough that the  postal inspectors should have\n\nrealized  that it did not comport with the Fourth Amendment.  The\n\n                                19\n\nlaw was settled  that the conditions  governing the execution  of\n\nanticipatory  warrants  must  be explicit,  clear,  and  narrowly\n\ndrawn.    The  instant  warrant  plainly  did  not satisfy  these\n\ncriteria; and, furthermore, the principal omission in the warrant\n\n  the lack  of any requirement that the contraband  arrive at the\n\npremises    was both glaring  and easily correctable.   Examining\n\nthe postal inspectors' actions in this light, it is crystal clear\n\nthat they  could,  and  should,  have  asked  the  magistrate  to\n\ncondition the search of  appellant's home on the delivery  of the\n\nvideotape  there; failing  both to insert  this condition  and to\n\nrecognize   the   consequences   of   its   omission  constituted\n\nobjectively  unreasonable  conduct.    It  follows,  then,   that\n\nattempting to  execute an  anticipatory search warrant  bereft of\n\nsuch a limiting condition fell \"outside the range of professional\n\ncompetence  expected\" of  federal agents.8   Malley, 475  U.S. at\n                                                   \n\n346 n.9; see  also United  States v. Washington,  797 F.2d  1461,\n                                               \n\n1473 (9th  Cir. 1986)  (ruling that \"patently  overbroad\" warrant\n\ndid not give  rise to  objective good faith  under Leon);  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.

Government agents\n\nmay  not trespass  beyond  the bounds  of well-delineated  Fourth\n\nAmendment  procedures and  then attempt  to blunt the  effects of\n\ntheir  pererrations by foisting the blame on the magistrate.  See\n                                                                 \n\nMalley, 475  U.S. at 346  n.9; United  States v. Baker,  894 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1144,  1148  (10th  Cir.  1990).   This  principle  applies  with\n\nespecial  force  where,  as  in  this  case,  a  sting operation,\n\nculminating  in   a  controlled  delivery,  is   involved.    The\n\ngovernment  knew  the plot;  indeed,  it  invented Globe-Tex  and\n\nproduced  the  sting  from start  to  finish.    Yet, the  postal\n\ninspectors  failed to share  the full script  of their stage-play\n\nwith  the magistrate.  They  cannot now fault  the magistrate for\n\ntheir bad reviews.\n\n          In  this respect,  the case  at  bar is  reminiscent of\n\nUnited States v. Fuccillo, 808 F.2d 173 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                                \n\n482 U.S.  905 (1987).  In  Fuccillo, we held that  the good faith\n                                   \n\nexception  would not  salvage  a search  where,  inter alia,  the\n                                                           \n\nwarrant did  not sufficiently describe  the things to  be seized,\n\nbecause the officer possessed facts which should have enabled him\n\nto describe the property  to be seized  more accurately.  Id.  at\n                                                             \n\n177,  178 (stating that the warrant \"could have been written with\n\nprecision to assure that  appellee's personal rights would remain\n\ninviolate\" and that \"the agents were reckless in not including in\n\n                                21\n\nthe affidavit information which was known or easily accessible to\n\nthem\").  Where the omission of a key ingredient, known to the law\n\nenforcement officers, leads to the subsequent invalidation of the\n\nwarrant,  the government faces a  high hurdle in  seeking to show\n\nobjective good faith.\n\n          When  issuing  anticipatory warrants,  magistrates must\n\nrely  to a large extent on the  expertise of federal agents as to\n\nthe certainty that the triggering event will occur.  Particularly\n\nwhere,  as in  this case,  the agents  preset elaborate  plans to\n\nsearch  and seize, magistrates can only act to ensure respect for\n\nthe Fourth  Amendment's protections if  they are informed  of the\n\nplan's discretionary elements.   Thus, the postal inspectors here\n\nwere  responsible for  conveying  to the  magistrate the  various\n\npossible  outcomes  in  their  scheme to  deliver  the  Globe-Tex\n\npackage to  Ricciardelli.   In particular, the  inspectors should\n\nhave  apprised the  magistrate  of  the (apparently  significant)\n\nchance  that the package would not be delivered to Ricciardelli's\n\nhome  at   all      a  possibility   that  they   undeniably  had\n\nenvisioned.9   Fully informed, the magistrate might  have drawn a\n\nmore finely tuned warrant.  See Rivera v. United States, 928 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n592, 603  (2d Cir.  1991); see  also Fuccillo,  808  F.2d at  178\n                                             \n\n(warning that, in applying for a warrant, agents must \"take every\n\n                    \n\n     9At the suppression hearing, Inspector Dunn, whose affidavit\nsupported the search warrant, testified that the inspectors' plan\nto   execute   the   search   warrant   \"[d]epend[ed]   on   what\n[Ricciardelli] did  after  he  picked  it up.\"    His  affidavit,\nhowever,  did  not disclose  to  the  magistrate  the variety  of\npossible outcomes or the inspectors' contingency plans.\n\n                                22\n\nstep that could reasonably be expected of them\"). \n\n          In  fine, the Leon doctrine does not apply in this case\n                            \n\nboth because a reasonably prudent officer should have  known that\n\nthe procured warrant was substantially defective on its face, and\n\nbecause  the defect was largely,  if not entirely,  the result of\n\nthe  officers' incomplete  account to  the magistrate.10   In the\n\ncircumstances, the  magistrate's imprimatur on the warrant cannot\n\nsave the day.  The exclusionary rule obtains.  Suppression of the\n\nevidence seized  by means of  the invalid warrant  is appropriate\n\n\"to compel respect  for the constitutional  guaranty in the  only\n\neffectively  available  way      by  removing  the  incentive  to\n\ndisregard it.\"  Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 656 (1961).\n                            \n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  need   go  no  further.11    Although  anticipatory\n\n                    \n\n     10Although  the  point is  not  instrumental  to either  the\nanalysis or the  outcome here,  we note that  the Leon  exception\n                                                      \ndoes  not absolve government officers from  every mistake made in\ngood faith  during the execution  of a warrant.   See,  Leon, 468\n                                                            \nU.S. at 920; see also United States v.

For instance,  Leon's good faith  rule\n                                              \nwould  not excuse  full-blown  mistakes  in  the execution  of  a\nwarrant.  See, e.g., Maryland  v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 89  n.14\n                                          \n(1987)  (explaining  that,  when  \"police begin  to  execute  the\nwarrant  and  . .  . discover  [a]  factual mistake[,  they] must\nreasonably  limit  their  search  accordingly\").    Hence,  if  a\nsituation  arises in  which  officers wrongly  conclude that  the\ntriggering event  needed to  animate an anticipatory  warrant has\noccurred, and  proceed to execute  a full search  in the  face of\nthis  mistake, we would not review that mistake under Leon's good\n                                                          \nfaith standard.\n\n     11After  this  appeal was  fully  briefed,  but before  oral\nargument,  the  Ninth  Circuit  struck  down  the  Protection  of\nChildren Against Sexual Exploitation  Act, 18 U.S.C.    2251-2255\n(1988),  of which section 2252(a)(2) is a part, on constitutional\ngrounds.  See United  States v. X-citement Video, Inc.,  982 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n                                23\n\nsearch warrants are constitutionally  allowable, the warrant used\n\nin this case suffered  from a fatal defect that was neither cured\n\nby any enforceable consent nor subject to amelioration  under the\n\nLeon doctrine.   Accordingly, appellant's motion  to suppress the\n    \n\nfruits \n\nof the search should have been granted.\n\n          Appellant's  conviction  is  vacated  and  the district\n                                                                 \n\ncourt's denial of appellant's motion to suppress is reversed.\n                                                            \n\n                    Concurring Opinion Follows  \n\n                    \n\n1285, 1292  (9th Cir. 1992).  This  issue was neither briefed nor\nargued  before us.    Hence, we  take  no view  of  the statute's\nconstitutionality.\n\n                                24\n\n          TORRUELLA,  Circuit Judge  (Concurring).    Although  I\n                                   \n\nagree  that  appellant's conviction  should  be  vacated, I  have\n\nserious  reservations  about  the  majority's  approach  to  that\n\nresult.  The majority unnecessarily addresses  the constitutional\n\nvalidity of  anticipatory search warrants and,  having done that,\n\nresolves the issue incorrectly.\n\n          I begin by describing  the areas in which my  views are\n\nmost similar  to those of the  majority.  We both  agree that the\n\nwarrant in this  case was utterly unsupported  by probable cause.\n\nI  find, however, that the warrant was tainted by information too\n\nstale to carry  the crisp reliability necessary  to find probable\n\ncause.   While the majority contentedly  dismisses this aspect of\n\nthe  case, ante  at 15 n.6,  I believe  that it  provides for the\n               \n\nproper resolution of this appeal.\n\n          As the  majority eloquently  states, \"In  1988, Houston\n\npolice   breathed  life   into  a   moribund  child   pornography\n\ninvestigation by giving federal postal inspectors a customer list\n\nunearthed  during  a  1975   probe  of  a  suspected  pornography\n\ndistributor.\"  Ante at 2.  The activity unearthed by the moribund\n                   \n\ninvestigation  --  appellant  ordered  two  films  from  a  child\n\npornography  dealer  --  occurred  in  1974.    In  1990,  postal\n\ninspectors  conducted  a  sting  which  lured  appellant  to  buy\n\nforbidden films, and applied for a warrant to search his home for\n\nthose  and  other  materials.   The  1990  operation  and warrant\n\napplication were  based,  thus, on  appellant's activities  which\n\noccurred sixteen years before.\n\n                               -24-\n                                24\n\n          In this circuit, we do not measure staleness merely  on\n\nthe  basis of the maturity of the  information.  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nBucuvalas, 970 F.2d 937,  940 (1st Cir. 1992), cert.  denied, 113\n                                                            \n\nS.  Ct.  1382  (1993).   Other  factors  include  1) whether  the\n\ncriminal activity is ongoing or discrete; 2) whether the criminal\n\nis  entrenched or nomadic; 3) whether  the items to be seized are\n\nlong-lasting or perishable;  and 4)  whether the  premises to  be\n\nsearched  are a secure operating  base or a  mere criminal forum.\n\nId.  The application of these factors to the facts of the present\n  \n\ncase, some not fully detailed in the majority opinion,  discloses\n\nthe stagnant heart of this case.\n\n          First,  the  statute  that  appellant  is  accused   of\n\nviolating, 18 U.S.C.   2252(a)(2), prohibits the receipt of child\n\npornography through interstate commerce or mail.  The evidence in\n\nthe record of this case shows that appellant only engaged in this\n\nactivity twice, on  occasions separated  by sixteen  years.   The\n\nactivity clearly cannot be described as ongoing.  This conclusion\n\nis  buttressed by the fact  that when appellant  placed the first\n\norder, in 1974, the receipt of child pornography through the mail\n\nwas not  prohibited.  An early  version of   2252  did not appear\n\nuntil  1978, with a substantial amendment  occurring in 1984, ten\n                                                                 \n\nyears  after appellant's  first order.   Thus,  appellant's first\n     \n\norder was  not  even illegal.    This is  a  point that  must  be\n                            \n\nemphasized.   There was no ongoing illegal activity in this case,\n\nbecause appellant acted illegally  only once, when the government\n\ninduced  him to  do so  in a  sting operation.   In  other words,\n\n                               -25-\n                                25\n\nappellant's  recent purchase  did not  update the  1974 purchase,\n\nbecause those earlier  activities are not comparable  in terms of\n\nviolation of the law.\n\n          Appellant's  nomadic  nature also  negates  the ongoing\n\nreliability  of his 1974 activity.  At that time, appellant lived\n\nin Newton,  Massachusetts.  Appellant later  moved to Framingham,\n\nMassachusetts, and  yet again  to another address  in Framingham.\n\nAppellant  lived  at his  final  residence  with  his mother  and\n\nbrother,  sharing  a  room  with  his  sibling.    The  affidavit\n\ncontained  no information  even  tending to  show that  appellant\n\nretained the  1974 materials  through these relocations,  or that\n\nhis coresidents  tolerated the  presence of prurient  material in\n\nthe shared premises.\n\n          I concede that the affidavit showed the ongoing utility\n\nof child pornography to collectors and pedophiles, discussing how\n\nsuch  individuals  keep their  dross  for long  periods  of time.\n\nStanding alone,  however, this  information does not  justify the\n\nconclusion  that appellant kept  the materials throughout sixteen\n\nyears  and  two  relocations.    The  affidavit  did  not  define\n\ncollector and pedophile, or characterize appellant as a member of\n\neither class.   See United States v.  Weber, 923 F.2d  1338, 1345\n                                           \n\n(9th Cir.  1990) (concerning  similar affidavit, the  court noted\n\n\"the  affidavit does not say  how many magazines  or pictures one\n\nmust buy in order to be defined as a 'collector'\").  As such, the\n\naffidavit  is  inconclusive  as to  the  ongoing  utility of  the\n\nmaterials  to  appellant,  especially  in light  of  his  various\n\n                               -26-\n                                26\n\nrelocations  and  the long  passage  of time.    Additionally, it\n\ncannot  be  presumed  automatically  that  appellant  would  keep\n\nmaterial which was illegal as a result of subsequent legislation,\n\nonce such a law went into effect in 1978.\n\n          Finally, there  is no showing  that appellant's address\n\nwas  a secure base.  The  affidavit did not adduce that appellant\n\nkept  a  cache  of   child  pornography  there,  and  appellant's\n\nrelocations  weaken  the  existence  of this  possibility.    The\n\naffidavit  merely established  that the  address was  appellant's\n\nhome, which he  shared with his mother  and brother.   Again, the\n\nfact  that he  shared his  premises with  nonparticipants in  the\n\ncriminal enterprise is a weakening point in terms of the presence\n\nof contraband at that location.\n\n          Based on these factors, I find it easy to conclude that\n\nthe information  pertaining to  appellant's 1974  materials could\n\nnot support  a probable  cause finding  in this  case.   Yet, the\n\nstagnant  information  formed   the  heart  of  the   inspector's\n\naffidavit and  was the  only basis  for the  attenuated inference\n\nthat appellant amassed  child pornography at  his home.   Without\n\nit, the  sting operation and the search warrant fall.  This is as\n\nfar as we should go, proceeding directly to quash the conviction.\n\nIt is unnecessary to go further into constitutional speculation.\n\n          The majority proceeds, however, to answer unnecessarily\n\na  wholly  novel  question   for  this  circuit:    whether   the\n\nanticipatory search  warrant  in this  case  was  constitutional.\n\nWorse yet, it issues a blanket license allowing its proliferation\n\n                               -27-\n                                27\n\ninto common use.\n\n          For the majority to  do so is an imprudent  exercise of\n\nour judicial power.  It is axiomatic that we avoid constitutional\n\nrulings  unless they  are strictly  necessary.

Because the\n                         \n\nsearch  warrant in this case was  utterly unsupported by probable\n\ncause,  addressing the  constitutionality of  anticipatory search\n\nwarrants amounts to such an impermissible advisory opinion.\n\n          To complicate  matters, the  majority elects  the wrong\n\nside  of  this  unnecessary   constitutional  issue,  choosing  a\n\nproblematic  and erroneous  result  in this  case.   Anticipatory\n\nsearch  warrants are  violative  of the  Fourth Amendment,  which\n\nplainly states  that \"no Warrants shall issue,  but upon probable\n\ncause.\"   Probable  cause must exist  to believe  at the  time of\n                                                                 \n\nissuance  that the  contraband is  in the  place to  be searched.\n                                 \n\nSteagald v.

One of the\n\nprinciple  evils which  that  provision prevents  is vesting  law\n\nenforcement officers with any discretion as to whether or not the\n\nconditions  of  the warrant  have been  complied  with.   This is\n\nprecisely what anticipatory warrants permit in deviating from the\n\ncontemporaneous probable cause standard.\n\n          It is  well established  that \"[t]he security  of one's\n\nprivacy  against arbitrary intrusion by the police -- which is at\n\nthe core of the Fourth Amendment  -- is basic to a free society.\"\n\nCoolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 453 (1971) (quoting Wolf\n                                                                 \n\nv.  Colorado, 338 U.S. 25,  27 (1949)).   Accordingly, the Fourth\n            \n\nAmendment places  very stringent  limits on officers  invading an\n\nindividual's privacy.   \"'The proceeding by  search warrant is  a\n\ndrastic  one,'  and  must  by carefully  circumscribed  so  as to\n\nprevent unauthorized invasions of  'the sanctity of a man's  home\n\nand the privacies of life.'\"  Berger v.

E.g., Andresen v. Maryland, 427\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  463, 480 (1976) (quoting  Coolidge, 403 U.S.  at 467).

Its\n            protection  consists  in  requiring  that\n            those  inferences be  drawn by  a neutral\n            and detached magistrate instead  of being\n            judged  by  the  officer  engaged  in the\n            often competitive enterprise of ferreting\n\n                               -30-\n                                30\n\n            out crime. \n\nJohnson  v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 13-14 (1948).  Otherwise,\n                         \n\nthe  Fourth Amendment  would be  a \"nullity\"  and homes  would be\n\n\"secure only in the discretion of police officers.\"  Id. at 14.\n                                                        \n\n          It is thus clear that the Fourth Amendment is concerned\n\nwith insulating the citizenry  from the whims of law  enforcement\n\nofficers.  Plainly  and simply,  the use  of anticipatory  search\n\nwarrants erodes this  insulation.   When an officer  is given  an\n\nanticipatory search warrant, the magistrate essentially instructs\n\nthe  officer as  follows:  When  the following  conditions occur,\n\nprobable cause to  conduct a search will  arise.  The officer  is\n\nthen left  to determine unilaterally  whether, when, and  how the\n\nconditions occur which give rise to probable cause.  \n\n          Law enforcement officers should not be the ones, absent\n\nexigent  circumstances, that  engage in  the sensitive  balancing\n\nrequired to  weigh the merits of  probable cause in a  given case\n\nbecause they are not neutral parties to the determination of that\n\ncrucial inquiry.  The  majority recognizes the need to  limit the\n\nofficers' discretion  in executing an  anticipatory warrant,  but\n\nnonetheless  foists upon  the  officers a  determination that  is\n\nquite  sensitive  in a  constitutional  sense.   An  anticipatory\n\nwarrant can only be  executed when four threads come  together to\n\nform a  coherent nexus:   the criminal  act, the  evidence to  be\n\nseized, the place to  be searched, and the \"temporal  dimension.\"\n\nAnte at 12.  The officers have virtually unfettered discretion to\n    \n\ndetermine when this \"temporal dimension\" has been fulfilled, with\n\n                               -31-\n                                31\n\nno input from a neutral and detached judicial officer.\n\n          The  majority  also  recognizes  that  \"[w]hen  issuing\n\nanticipatory warrants, magistrates must rely to a large extent on\n\nthe  expertise of  federal agents  as to  the certainty  that the\n\ntriggering event will occur.\"  Ante  at 21.  Because the majority\n                                   \n\nfinds that  probability is the touchstone of probable cause, ante\n                                                                 \n\nat  5,  this fact  demonstrates  the great  amount  of discretion\n\ndelegated to law enforcement  officers in the anticipatory search\n\nwarrant  context.   Law  enforcement  officers  put together  the\n\nprobability that gives rise to probable cause, and then determine\n\nwhen the eventuality occurs.  In other words, the officers are in\n\ncontrol of the entire warrant process, shaping the probable cause\n\ndetermination  from  start to  finish.   Such  an  unfettered and\n\njudicially  uncontrolled intrusion  into an  individual's privacy\n\ninterest is precisely what  the Fourth Amendment was designed  to\n\nprevent.\n\n          Incredibly,  given  the  majority's  resolution  of the\n\nissue, no government interest weighed heavily in favor of the use\n\nof anticipatory search warrants.  See New Jersey v. TLO, 469 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n325,  337   (1985)   (balancing  \"the   individual's   legitimate\n\nexpectations  of  privacy  and   personal  security\"  with   \"the\n\ngovernment need for  effective methods to  deal with breaches  of\n\npublic order\" in passing on the validity of a class of searches).\n\n          An officer \"engaged in the often competitive enterprise\n\nof ferreting out crime,\" Johnson, 333 U.S. at 14, has two options\n                                \n\nin cases  such as  this one.    Once the  controlled delivery  of\n\n                               -32-\n                                32\n\ncontraband is complete, he may apply for a search warrant to  the\n\nappropriate  magistrate.   Alternatively, if  an exigency  should\n\narise  in  the  course   of  the  controlled  delivery  requiring\n\nimmediate  action,  the  officer   is  authorized  to  conduct  a\n\nwarrantless   search   pursuant   to   the   well-known   exigent\n\ncircumstances exception  to the  warrant requirement.   In short,\n\nthere  is no  legitimate need  for such  a  novel erosion  of the\n\nFourth Amendment as is promoted by anticipatory search warrants.\n\n          The  majority's analogy  to  warrants for  wiretapping,\n\nante  at 7  n.3, is  misapplied.   When authorizing a  wiretap, a\n    \n\nmagistrate must  observe  \"precise and  discriminate\"  procedures\n\nspecific to wiretaps.   Katz v. United States,  389 U.S. 347, 355\n                                             \n\n(1967)  (quoting Berger,  388  U.S. at  57).   For  example,  the\n                       \n\nmagistrate  must identify the  telephone number to  be tapped and\n\nthe  conversations to be seized.   United States  v. Donovan, 429\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 413  (1977).

These safeguards  ensure that  \"'no\n\ngreater invasion  of privacy  [is] permitted than  [is] necessary\n\nunder  the circumstances.'\"    Katz,  389  U.S. at  355  (quoting\n                                   \n\nBerger,  388 U.S. at 57).

The  postal  inspectors   subsequently  spawned  a\n\nfictitious \"front\" company,  Globe-Tex Specialties, and  targeted\n\nRicciardelli   in   a  sting   operation.     After   preliminary\n\ncorrespondence elicited  interest on Ricciardelli's  part, Globe-\n\nTex  sent him a catalog from which he ordered several videotapes.\n\nGlobe-Tex  notified  him  that  only  one  tape  was  immediately\n\navailable and promised to mail it forthwith.\n\n          On the day prior to the  scheduled delivery, the postal\n\ninspectors applied for,  and a magistrate judge issued,  a search\n\n                                2\n\nwarrant.   The  warrant  authorized the  investigators to  search\n\nappellant's residence for, inter alia, correspondence, documents,\n                                     \n\nand  objects related  to  contacts with  either Globe-Tex  or the\n\nHouston pornography  dealer.   By its  express terms, the  search\n\nwarrant would \"not be  effective until after delivery by  mail to\n\nand  receipt by  Steven  L. Ricciardelli  of  the .  . .  package\n\ncontaining the videotape.\"\n\n          The day after the warrant was issued, postal inspectors\n\ngave  the package  containing  the videotape  to  the local  post\n\noffice  for delivery.  A  return receipt, affixed  to the parcel,\n\nrequired that appellant sign for it.  The letter carrier tried to\n\ndeliver  the  package  that  day  but  appellant  was  not  home.\n\nFollowing standard  practice, the  postman left  a notice on  the\n\npremises indicating that appellant could collect the  item at the\n\npost office.  That afternoon, appellant retrieved the package and\n\nreturned  to  his  home.    About thirty  minutes  later,  postal\n\ninspectors executed the  warrant, recovering the videotape,  some\n\ncorrespondence, and  a number  of other  films and  magazines not\n\nmentioned in the warrant.\n\n          Appellant was indicted.   The district  court summarily\n\ndenied  his motion  to  suppress the  materials  seized from  his\n\ndwelling.   Subsequently, appellant  stipulated to  the pertinent\n\nfacts and the judge found him guilty.  This appeal ensued.\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\n\n          We  divide our analysis of this case into segments.  We\n\nfirst  discuss  the  constitutionality  of   anticipatory  search\n\n                                3\n\nwarrants  as  a  general matter.    We  then  turn to  specifics,\n\ndiscussing certain  alleged deficiencies in the  warrant obtained\n\nby  the postal inspectors.  We end by addressing the government's\n\ncontentions  that  appellant's submissiveness  and/or  the postal\n\ninspectors' good faith palliated any defects in the warrant.\n\n                A.  Anticipatory Search Warrants.\n                                                \n\n          At the  outset, appellant  seeks to bowl  a ten-strike:\n\nhe  asks us to  rule that so-called  anticipatory search warrants\n\nare  per  se  unconstitutional.   This  initiative  presents    a\n            \n\nquestion of first impression in this circuit.1\n\n          Anticipatory  search warrants are  peculiar to property\n\nin transit.   Such warrants provide a solution  to a dilemma that\n\nhas long vexed  law enforcement  agencies:  whether,  on the  one\n\nhand,  to allow the delivery of contraband to be completed before\n\nobtaining  a  search warrant,  thus  risking  the destruction  or\n\ndispersement  of  evidence in  the ensuing  interval, or,  on the\n\nother hand,  seizing  the contraband  on  its arrival  without  a\n\nwarrant,  thus  risking  suppression.    Anticipatory warrants   \n\nwarrants  that are issued in advance of the receipt of particular\n\nproperty  at the premises designated  in the warrant2    strike a\n\n                    \n\n     1We  cannot escape  this issue  for, if  anticipatory search\nwarrants are valid at all, the rules pertaining to their issuance\nwill necessarily  determine the legal sufficiency  of the warrant\nobtained in this case.\n\n     2To be sure, an anticipatory  warrant can be directed toward\nthe  search of  a  person  instead  of  a place.    For  ease  in\nreference, however, we speak  throughout this opinion of searches\nof  places rather than of persons (although we note that the same\nprinciples apply in either case).\n\n                                4\n\nthird  chord,  protecting  privacy rights  by  requiring  advance\n\njudicial  approval  of  a  planned  search  while  simultaneously\n\nsatisfying legitimate  law enforcement needs.

His  theory  is epibolic.    First, he  remarks  the\n\nobvious    that  a warrant  can  issue only  \"upon  a showing  of\n\nprobable cause,\" U.S. Const.  Amend. IV   and interprets  this as\n\nrequiring probable  cause to believe  that the  contraband to  be\n\nseized  is in  the place  to be  searched at  the time  a warrant\n\nissues.   He then erects a second proposition on this problematic\n\npedestal,   professing   that   a    magistrate   can   have   no\n\nconstitutionally sufficient basis for issuing a warrant at a time\n\nwhen the contraband is  elsewhere and, presumably, probable cause\n\ndoes not exist.  In our view, appellant's theory misconstrues the\n\nmeaning of probable cause.\n\n          The probable  cause doctrine does not  require that the\n\ncontraband to be seized must presently be located at the premises\n\nto be searched, only that there is probable cause to believe that\n\na crime  has been (or is being) committed and that evidence of it\n\ncan likely  be found at  the described locus  at the time  of the\n                                                                 \n\nsearch.

In many\n\ncases, the facts put forward in support of an anticipatory search\n\nwarrant predicated  on the  planned delivery  of contraband  to a\n\nparticular  location  establish  a  greater  likelihood  that the\n\ncontraband will  be found there at the  time of the search (which\n\nwill be  contemporaneous with the  arrival of the  contraband, or\n\nnearly  so)  than do  facts  put  forward in  support  of  a more\n\nconventional  search  warrant  predicated  on  the  known  recent\n\nlocation of  contraband at the  proposed search site.   Moreover,\n\nthe  method  of  the  Fourth  Amendment    inserting  a  neutral,\n\ndetached judicial officer as a buffer between a citizen's privacy\n\n                                6\n\nrights and  potential government overreaching    works equally as\n\nwell  in  connection  with  anticipatory  warrants.    In  either\n\ninstance, contemporary  or anticipatory,  the focal point  of the\n\nmagistrate's inquiry is  whether there is probable cause to think\n\nthat the  contraband will be at  the place to be  searched at the\n\ntime of  the contemplated intrusion.   That the  event justifying\n\nthe  intrusion  has  not  yet  occurred   does  not  distort  the\n\ndecisionmaking process.  Rather, the magistrate must simply widen\n\nhis  horizons  to  take  into account  the  likelihood  that  the\n\ntriggering  event  will occur  on  schedule and  as  predicted in\n\nmaking his probable cause determination.3\n\n          Mindful   of   these   considerations,   we   find   it\n\nunsurprising that  every circuit  to have addressed  the question\n\nhas held that anticipatory  search warrants are not categorically\n\nunconstitutional.

We, too,  believe  that  there  is no  Fourth\n\nAmendment infirmity indigenous to anticipatory search  warrants  \n\nalthough  such warrants must,  of course, be  issued under proper\n\ncircumstances, upon a proper showing, and with proper safeguards.\n\nWe hold, therefore, that  when law enforcement personnel  offer a\n\nmagistrate  reliable,  independent  evidence  indicating  that  a\n\ndelivery of  contraband will  very likely  occur at  a particular\n\nplace, and when the magistrate conditions the warrant's execution\n\nfor the search  of that place on  that delivery, the warrant,  if\n\nnot  overbroad  or  otherwise  defective,  passes  constitutional\n\nmuster.  That the  contraband has not yet reached the premises to\n\nbe  searched  at  the   time  the  warrant  issues  is   not,  in\n\nconstitutional terms, an insuperable obstacle.\n\n                    B.  Exigent Circumstances.\n                                             \n\n          Appellant  next  suggests  that,  even  if anticipatory\n\nwarrants are  not invalid per se,  their use must  be confined to\n                                \n\ncircumstances  in which time is of the essence, e.g., drug cases,\n                                                    \n\nwhere  a significant danger lurks that the evidence might be lost\n\nif  the search  is not  made in  close temporal proximity  to the\n\ncontraband's  delivery.   We disagree:   the  absence  of exigent\n\ncircumstances   and the government readily concedes that none are\n\npresent  here     does not  outlaw  the  use  of an  anticipatory\n\nwarrant.\n\n          We  need  not  linger.   The  Eighth  Circuit  recently\n\n                                8\n\nrejected this  precise argument.  In Tagbering,  the court stated\n                                              \n\nthat  the  presence  or   absence  of  exigent  circumstances  is\n\nirrelevant in determining whether an  anticipatory search warrant\n\nshould issue.  See Tagbering, 985 F.2d at 950 n.6.  We share this\n                            \n\nview.  Where the probable  cause requirement for an  anticipatory\n\nsearch warrant has been  fulfilled, there is no necessity  for an\n\nindependent showing of exigent  circumstances.  Cf.

The other  side of the coin is\n      \nequally revealing:   exigent circumstances will  rarely, if ever,\nbe present  in child pornography  cases, as history  teaches that\ncollectors  prefer  not  to  dispose of  their  dross,  typically\nretaining obscene materials for years.\n\n                                9\n\npornography investigations than in  drug investigations to obtain\n\na conventional search warrant  does not cheapen the value  of the\n\nmagistrate's initial probable cause determination  and, thus, \"is\n\nnot dispositive of any relevant issue.\"  Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1271\n                                               \n\nn.3.  Consequently, we hold that an  otherwise valid anticipatory\n\nwarrant does not fail merely because the officers might have lost\n\nnothing by waiting until  the delivery had been  completed before\n\nobtaining a warrant.\n\n                        C.  Definiteness.\n                                        \n\n          We  now reach the crux  of the suppression  issue:  Was\n\nthe  warrant  fatally defective  because  it  failed to  forge  a\n\nsufficient  link between  the  arrival of  the videotape  and the\n\nproposed search of appellant's abode?  We think that it was.\n\n          Although   anticipatory   search   warrants   are   not\n\nconstitutionally  foreclosed, see  supra  Part  II(A), a  warrant\n                                        \n\nconditioned  on  a future  event presents  a potential  for abuse\n\nabove  and beyond that which exists in more traditional settings:\n\ninevitably,  the executing  agents are  called upon  to determine\n\nwhen and whether  the triggering event  specified in the  warrant\n\nhas actually  occurred.  Consequently, magistrates  who are asked\n\nto issue such warrants must be particularly vigilant  in ensuring\n\nthat the  opportunities for exercising unfettered  discretion are\n\neliminated.  To satisfy these  concerns, the magistrate must  set\n\nconditions governing an anticipatory warrant  that are \"explicit,\n\nclear,  and  narrowly drawn  so as  to avoid  misunderstanding or\n\nmanipulation  by government agents.\"  Garcia, 882 F.2d at 703-04;\n                                            \n\n                                10\n\naccord Tagbering, 985 F.2d at 950.\n                \n\n          There   are   two   particular   dimensions   in  which\n\nanticipatory  warrants  must limit  the discretion  of government\n\nagents.  First,  the magistrate must  ensure that the  triggering\n\nevent is both ascertainable and preordained.   The warrant should\n\nrestrict the officers' discretion  in detecting the occurrence of\n\nthe event to almost ministerial proportions,  similar to a search\n\nparty's  discretion in locating the  place to be  searched.  Only\n\nthen,  in the prototypical case, are the ends of explicitness and\n\nclarity served.   Second,  the contraband must  be on a  sure and\n\nirreversible course  to its destination,  and a future  search of\n\nthe  destination  must  be  made expressly  contingent  upon  the\n\ncontraband's arrival  there.  Under such  circumstances, a number\n\nof  courts have found  anticipatory search warrants  to be valid.\n\nSee,  e.g.,  Nixon,  918  F.2d  at  903  n.6;  United  States  v.\n                                                             \n\nDornhofer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513205\"><a href=\"/opinion/513205/united-states-v-james-john-dornhofer/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1198 (4th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span>\n                                                            \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989); Goodwin, 854 F.2d at 36; United States v.

We  adopt  the  \"sure  and\n             \n\nirreversible course\" standard as a  means of judging the validity\n\nof anticipatory warrants.  \n\n          It  is at this juncture,  however, that we part company\n\nwith the government.   The  sure course standard  functions as  a\n\nproxy  for the actual presence of the  contraband at the locus to\n\nbe searched.   It offers the  magistrate a trustworthy  assurance\n\nthat  the contraband,  though not  yet on  the site,  will almost\n\n                                11\n\ncertainly  be located  there  at the  time  of the  search,  thus\n\nfulfilling the requirement of future  probable cause.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nHale, 784 F.2d at  1468 (finding a warrant for  child pornography\n    \n\nthat was to  be delivered to  defendant at his home  to be \"on  a\n\nsure  course to its  destination\" and,  hence, valid);  Goff, 681\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 1240 (finding the requirement met where defendant boarded\n\nan airplane and agents then  procured a warrant to search  him at\n\nthe flight's terminus).  Implicit   in   this  standard   is  the\n\nrecognition that the evidence must  be on an ascertainable course\n\nso that  the event  on which the  warrant is conditioned  bears a\n\ndefinite relationship to  the premises  to be searched.   It  is,\n\nmoreover,  imperative that  the warrant  establish not  only this\n\nkind of tri-cornered nexus between the criminal act, the evidence\n\nto  be seized, and  the place to  be searched, but  also that the\n\nnexus incorporate  a temporal  dimension.  The  important privacy\n\ninterests  protected by  the Fourth  Amendment make  it incumbent\n\nupon  the magistrate to  craft the warrant  with explicit, clear,\n\nand narrowly  drawn conditions governing its  execution to ensure\n\nthat  the anticipated nexus will  actually exist if  and when the\n\nwarrant  is  executed.    Phrased another  way,  the  event  that\n\ntriggers the search must be the delivery of the contraband to the\n                                                                 \n\npremises to be searched, thereby leaving as little as possible to\n                       \n\nthe discretion of the agent executing the warrant.  See 2 LaFave,\n                                                       \n\nsupra   3.7(d), at 101-02.\n     \n\n          The instant warrant imposed no such  strict conditions.\n\nTo  the contrary, it overlooked  (or, at least,  did not address)\n\n                                12\n\nthe need for  establishing a nexus  between the triggering  event\n\nand the place  to be  searched.  Here,  the warrant authorized  a\n\nsearch  not of appellant's person  but of his  home, for evidence\n\nrelating to  his  dealings with  child pornography  distributors.\n\nThe  search was  to be  triggered by  delivery of  the videotape.\n\nThus,  the very premise on which  the warrant rested was that the\n\nvideotape's arrival would signal  the existence of probable cause\n\nto believe that evidence of  a crime   the videotape itself    as\n\nwell as  evidence of  criminal predisposition or  other nefarious\n\nactivity was likely located in the dwelling.  The warrant's text,\n\nhowever, completely  ignored  this connection,  conditioning  the\n\nsearch not  on the arrival  of the videotape  at the place  to be\n\nsearched,  but, rather,  on appellant's  personal receipt  of the\n\nvideotape,  wherever he might be  and wherever he  might take his\n\nprize.  By the terms of the warrant, once appellant retrieved the\n\npackage  at  the post  office, the  postal inspectors  could have\n\nsearched  his   abode  whether  or  not   appellant  brought  the\n\ncontraband there.  An anticipatory search warrant that cedes such\n\ngreat  discretion  to  the  executing  agents  cannot   withstand\n\nconstitutional scrutiny.\n\n          In  United States v. Hendricks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">743</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n                                        \n\n1985),  cert. denied,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">1006</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986),  the  Ninth Circuit\n                    \n\ngrappled with an almost  identical nexus problem when considering\n\nthe  validity  of  an anticipatory  warrant.    There,  a package\n\ncontaining  contraband  was  shipped   in  a  way  that  required\n\ndefendant to pick  up the package personally, rather  than merely\n\n                                13\n\nhaving it delivered to  his home.  See  id. at 653.  Even  though\n                                           \n\nthe  contraband actually  arrived at  defendant's residence,  the\n\nNinth  Circuit invalidated  the  warrant on  the  ground that  it\n\nfailed to forge the requisite link between the described premises\n\nand the  illegal activity.  See  id. at 655.   The court reasoned\n                                    \n\nthat,  although the  warrant  listed a  specific  location to  be\n\nsearched,  once the box was picked up any number of circumstances\n\nmight intervene to snuff  out a future connection between  it and\n\nthe premises.  See id. at 654-55.\n                      \n\n          The  case  at  hand  parallels Hendricks  in  important\n                                                  \n\nrespects.5  Here,  as in Hendricks, the  package, once retrieved,\n                                  \n\ncould  have  been taken  anywhere.   Here,  as in  Hendricks, the\n                                                            \n\nconditions governing  the execution  of  the anticipatory  search\n\nwarrant  were  extremely susceptible  to  the  discretion of  the\n\nexecuting officers.  Here,  as in Hendricks, the warrant  was too\n                                           \n\nbroadly drawn in  that it did not ensure that  the contraband was\n\non a sure  course to the  premises to be searched.   Here, as  in\n\nHendricks,  even  though  the  defendant  happened  to  take  the\n         \n\ncontraband home, the warrant did not establish an adequate three-\n\nway  nexus between  the  criminal activity,  the  evidence to  be\n\nseized, and the premises.  It follows inexorably that here, as in\n\nHendricks, the search warrant was invalid.\n         \n\n          Nor can we read  the warrant as treating the  search of\n\n                    \n\n     5To be sure, the case at hand differs  from Hendricks in the\n                                                          \nrespect  that, here, the authorities made  an abortive attempt to\ndeliver the package directly to the defendant's residence.  We do\nnot consider this distinction to possess decretory significance.\n\n                                14\n\nappellant's  abode as an event  separate from his  receipt of the\n\nvideotape.  The affidavit supporting the warrant bases the postal\n\ninspector's  conclusions anent  probable  cause upon  appellant's\n\nfuture receipt of the videotape at his home.  What is more, it is\n\nthe triggering condition of  appellant's receipt of the videotape\n\nat  home  that eliminates  alternative  possibilities, say,  that\n\nappellant  was a  runner  for some  other  person, or  simply  an\n\ninternuncio,  thereby producing  probable cause  to believe  that\n\nappellant is  a collector of  child pornography and,  hence, that\n\nhis residence likely contains evidence of his criminality.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., id. at 654 (invalidating warrant where triggering event was\n         \n\nnot  certain  and  independent  probable cause  did  not  exist).\n\nTherefore, unless the search  can be saved on some  other theory,\n\nan inquiry to which we now turn, the fruits of the search must be\n\nsuppressed.6\n\n                           D.  Consent.\n                                      \n\n          The government asseverates  that any  infirmity in  the\n\nsearch warrant  was assuaged  by appellant's supposed  consent to\n\nthe  postal inspectors' seizure of the videotape.  We reject this\n\n                    \n\n     6Our  concurring brother  takes  the view  that the  warrant\ncannot stand because it  was based in part on  stale information.\nSee, e.g., United  States v.

The Court  believed that there would often be no\n       \n\ndeterrence when police  obtain evidence in  reliance on a  search\n\nwarrant that is subsequently found to be defective; \"in most such\n\ncases,  there is no police illegality and thus nothing to deter.\"\n\nId.  at 921.   Hence,  exclusion of  seized evidence  under those\n   \n\nconditions  serves no  salutary  purpose  because  that  sanction\n\n\"cannot  logically   contribute  to  the  deterrence   of  Fourth\n\nAmendment violations.\"  Id.\n                           \n\n          Although weakening the exclusionary rule, the Court did\n\nnot defenestrate it.

Thus, to cite  two instances, suppression would  be\n   \n\nproper where  the \"warrant  [is] .  . .  so facially deficient   \n\ni.e., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the\n    \n\nthings  to  be  seized     that  the  executing  officers  cannot\n\n                                17\n\nreasonably presume it to be valid,\" or the warrant is \"so lacking\n\nin indicia of probable  cause as to render official belief in its\n\nexistence  entirely  unreasonable.\"   Id.  at  923 (citation  and\n                                         \n\ninternal quotation  marks omitted).

After studying the record on appeal, we conclude that the\n\nwarrant,  as  issued,  contained  non-technical  defects  readily\n\nobservable to experienced  postal inspectors and, moreover,  that\n\nthe  inspectors'  omissions  in the  warrant-application  process\n\nconstituted  a  second,   independently  sufficient  ground   for\n\ndistinguishing this  case from  Leon.  Accordingly,  the evidence\n                                    \n\nseized  under the  anticipatory warrant  and introduced  at trial\n\nshould have been suppressed.\n\n          In connection  with  the first  prong of  the test,  we\n\nfind, without serious question, that the defects on the warrant's\n\nface were apparent enough that the  postal inspectors should have\n\nrealized  that it did not comport with the Fourth Amendment.  The\n\n                                19\n\nlaw was settled  that the conditions  governing the execution  of\n\nanticipatory  warrants  must  be explicit,  clear,  and  narrowly\n\ndrawn.    The  instant  warrant  plainly  did  not satisfy  these\n\ncriteria; and, furthermore, the principal omission in the warrant\n\n  the lack  of any requirement that the contraband  arrive at the\n\npremises    was both glaring  and easily correctable.   Examining\n\nthe postal inspectors' actions in this light, it is crystal clear\n\nthat they  could,  and  should,  have  asked  the  magistrate  to\n\ncondition the search of  appellant's home on the delivery  of the\n\nvideotape  there; failing  both to insert  this condition  and to\n\nrecognize   the   consequences   of   its   omission  constituted\n\nobjectively  unreasonable  conduct.    It  follows,  then,   that\n\nattempting to  execute an  anticipatory search warrant  bereft of\n\nsuch a limiting condition fell \"outside the range of professional\n\ncompetence  expected\" of  federal agents.8   Malley, 475  U.S. at\n                                                   \n\n346 n.9; see  also United  States v.

Thus, the postal inspectors here\n\nwere  responsible for  conveying  to the  magistrate the  various\n\npossible  outcomes  in  their  scheme to  deliver  the  Globe-Tex\n\npackage to  Ricciardelli.   In particular, the  inspectors should\n\nhave  apprised the  magistrate  of  the (apparently  significant)\n\nchance  that the package would not be delivered to Ricciardelli's\n\nhome  at   all      a  possibility   that  they   undeniably  had\n\nenvisioned.9   Fully informed, the magistrate might  have drawn a\n\nmore finely tuned warrant.

Although  I\n                                   \n\nagree  that  appellant's conviction  should  be  vacated, I  have\n\nserious  reservations  about  the  majority's  approach  to  that\n\nresult.  The majority unnecessarily addresses  the constitutional\n\nvalidity of  anticipatory search warrants and,  having done that,\n\nresolves the issue incorrectly.\n\n          I begin by describing  the areas in which my  views are\n\nmost similar  to those of the  majority.  We both  agree that the\n\nwarrant in this  case was utterly unsupported  by probable cause.\n\nI  find, however, that the warrant was tainted by information too\n\nstale to carry  the crisp reliability necessary  to find probable\n\ncause.   While the majority contentedly  dismisses this aspect of\n\nthe  case, ante  at 15 n.6,  I believe  that it  provides for the\n               \n\nproper resolution of this appeal.\n\n          As the  majority eloquently  states, \"In  1988, Houston\n\npolice   breathed  life   into  a   moribund  child   pornography\n\ninvestigation by giving federal postal inspectors a customer list\n\nunearthed  during  a  1975   probe  of  a  suspected  pornography\n\ndistributor.\"  Ante at 2.  The activity unearthed by the moribund\n                   \n\ninvestigation  --  appellant  ordered  two  films  from  a  child\n\npornography  dealer  --  occurred  in  1974.    In  1990,  postal\n\ninspectors  conducted  a  sting  which  lured  appellant  to  buy\n\nforbidden films, and applied for a warrant to search his home for\n\nthose  and  other  materials.   The  1990  operation  and warrant\n\napplication were  based,  thus, on  appellant's activities  which\n\noccurred sixteen years before.\n\n                               -24-\n                                24\n\n          In this circuit, we do not measure staleness merely  on\n\nthe  basis of the maturity of the  information.  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nBucuvalas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587567\"><a href=\"/opinion/587567/united-states-v-george-m-bucuvalas-united-states-of-america-v-aristedes/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  940 (1st Cir. 1992), cert.  denied, 113\n                                                            \n\nS.  Ct.  1382  (1993).   Other  factors  include  1) whether  the\n\ncriminal activity is ongoing or discrete; 2) whether the criminal\n\nis  entrenched or nomadic; 3) whether  the items to be seized are\n\nlong-lasting or perishable;  and 4)  whether the  premises to  be\n\nsearched  are a secure operating  base or a  mere criminal forum.\n\nId.  The application of these factors to the facts of the present\n  \n\ncase, some not fully detailed in the majority opinion,  discloses\n\nthe stagnant heart of this case.\n\n          First,  the  statute  that  appellant  is  accused   of\n\nviolating, 18 U.S.C.   2252(a)(2), prohibits the receipt of child\n\npornography through interstate commerce or mail.  The evidence in\n\nthe record of this case shows that appellant only engaged in this\n\nactivity twice, on  occasions separated  by sixteen  years.   The\n\nactivity clearly cannot be described as ongoing.  This conclusion\n\nis  buttressed by the fact  that when appellant  placed the first\n\norder, in 1974, the receipt of child pornography through the mail\n\nwas not  prohibited.  An early  version of   2252  did not appear\n\nuntil  1978, with a substantial amendment  occurring in 1984, ten\n                                                                 \n\nyears  after appellant's  first order.   Thus,  appellant's first\n     \n\norder was  not  even illegal.    This is  a  point that  must  be\n                            \n\nemphasized.   There was no ongoing illegal activity in this case,\n\nbecause appellant acted illegally  only once, when the government\n\ninduced  him to  do so  in a  sting operation.   In  other words,\n\n                               -25-\n                                25\n\nappellant's  recent purchase  did not  update the  1974 purchase,\n\nbecause those earlier  activities are not comparable  in terms of\n\nviolation of the law.\n\n          Appellant's  nomadic  nature also  negates  the ongoing\n\nreliability  of his 1974 activity.  At that time, appellant lived\n\nin Newton,  Massachusetts.  Appellant later  moved to Framingham,\n\nMassachusetts, and  yet again  to another address  in Framingham.\n\nAppellant  lived  at his  final  residence  with  his mother  and\n\nbrother,  sharing  a  room  with  his  sibling.    The  affidavit\n\ncontained  no information  even  tending to  show that  appellant\n\nretained the  1974 materials  through these relocations,  or that\n\nhis coresidents  tolerated the  presence of prurient  material in\n\nthe shared premises.\n\n          I concede that the affidavit showed the ongoing utility\n\nof child pornography to collectors and pedophiles, discussing how\n\nsuch  individuals  keep their  dross  for long  periods  of time.\n\nStanding alone,  however, this  information does not  justify the\n\nconclusion  that appellant kept  the materials throughout sixteen\n\nyears  and  two  relocations.    The  affidavit  did  not  define\n\ncollector and pedophile, or characterize appellant as a member of\n\neither class.   See United States v.  Weber, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1338</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1345\n                                           \n\n(9th Cir.  1990) (concerning  similar affidavit, the  court noted\n\n\"the  affidavit does not say  how many magazines  or pictures one\n\nmust buy in order to be defined as a 'collector'\").  As such, the\n\naffidavit  is  inconclusive  as to  the  ongoing  utility of  the\n\nmaterials  to  appellant,  especially  in light  of  his  various\n\n                               -26-\n                                26\n\nrelocations  and  the long  passage  of time.    Additionally, it\n\ncannot  be  presumed  automatically  that  appellant  would  keep\n\nmaterial which was illegal as a result of subsequent legislation,\n\nonce such a law went into effect in 1978.\n\n          Finally, there  is no showing  that appellant's address\n\nwas  a secure base.  The  affidavit did not adduce that appellant\n\nkept  a  cache  of   child  pornography  there,  and  appellant's\n\nrelocations  weaken  the  existence  of this  possibility.    The\n\naffidavit  merely established  that the  address was  appellant's\n\nhome, which he  shared with his mother  and brother.   Again, the\n\nfact  that he  shared his  premises with  nonparticipants in  the\n\ncriminal enterprise is a weakening point in terms of the presence\n\nof contraband at that location.\n\n          Based on these factors, I find it easy to conclude that\n\nthe information  pertaining to  appellant's 1974  materials could\n\nnot support  a probable  cause finding  in this  case.   Yet, the\n\nstagnant  information  formed   the  heart  of  the   inspector's\n\naffidavit and  was the  only basis  for the  attenuated inference\n\nthat appellant amassed  child pornography at  his home.   Without\n\nit, the  sting operation and the search warrant fall.  This is as\n\nfar as we should go, proceeding directly to quash the conviction.\n\nIt is unnecessary to go further into constitutional speculation.\n\n          The majority proceeds, however, to answer unnecessarily\n\na  wholly  novel  question   for  this  circuit:    whether   the\n\nanticipatory search  warrant  in this  case  was  constitutional.\n\nWorse yet, it issues a blanket license allowing its proliferation\n\n                               -27-\n                                27\n\ninto common use.\n\n          For the majority to  do so is an imprudent  exercise of\n\nour judicial power.  It is axiomatic that we avoid constitutional\n\nrulings  unless they  are strictly  necessary.

Otherwise,\n                         \n\nthe  Fourth Amendment  would be  a \"nullity\"  and homes  would be\n\n\"secure only in the discretion of police officers.\"  Id. at 14.\n                                                        \n\n          It is thus clear that the Fourth Amendment is concerned\n\nwith insulating the citizenry  from the whims of law  enforcement\n\nofficers.  Plainly  and simply,  the use  of anticipatory  search\n\nwarrants erodes this  insulation.   When an officer  is given  an\n\nanticipatory search warrant, the magistrate essentially instructs\n\nthe  officer as  follows:  When  the following  conditions occur,\n\nprobable cause to  conduct a search will  arise.  The officer  is\n\nthen left  to determine unilaterally  whether, when, and  how the\n\nconditions occur which give rise to probable cause.  \n\n          Law enforcement officers should not be the ones, absent\n\nexigent  circumstances, that  engage in  the sensitive  balancing\n\nrequired to  weigh the merits of  probable cause in a  given case\n\nbecause they are not neutral parties to the determination of that\n\ncrucial inquiry.  The  majority recognizes the need to  limit the\n\nofficers' discretion  in executing an  anticipatory warrant,  but\n\nnonetheless  foists upon  the  officers a  determination that  is\n\nquite  sensitive  in a  constitutional  sense.   An  anticipatory\n\nwarrant can only be  executed when four threads come  together to\n\nform a  coherent nexus:   the criminal  act, the  evidence to  be\n\nseized, the place to  be searched, and the \"temporal  dimension.\"\n\nAnte at 12.  The officers have virtually unfettered discretion to\n    \n\ndetermine when this \"temporal dimension\" has been fulfilled, with\n\n                               -31-\n                                31\n\nno input from a neutral and detached judicial officer.\n\n          The  majority  also  recognizes  that  \"[w]hen  issuing\n\nanticipatory warrants, magistrates must rely to a large extent on\n\nthe  expertise of  federal agents  as to  the certainty  that the\n\ntriggering event will occur.\"  Ante  at 21.  Because the majority\n                                   \n\nfinds that  probability is the touchstone of probable cause, ante\n                                                                 \n\nat  5,  this fact  demonstrates  the great  amount  of discretion\n\ndelegated to law enforcement  officers in the anticipatory search\n\nwarrant  context.   Law  enforcement  officers  put together  the\n\nprobability that gives rise to probable cause, and then determine\n\nwhen the eventuality occurs.  In other words, the officers are in\n\ncontrol of the entire warrant process, shaping the probable cause\n\ndetermination  from  start to  finish.   Such  an  unfettered and\n\njudicially  uncontrolled intrusion  into an  individual's privacy\n\ninterest is precisely what  the Fourth Amendment was designed  to\n\nprevent.\n\n          Incredibly,  given  the  majority's  resolution  of the\n\nissue, no government interest weighed heavily in favor of the use\n\nof anticipatory search warrants.  See New Jersey v. TLO, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111301\"><a href=\"/opinion/111301/new-jersey-v-tlo/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n                                                       \n\n<span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  337   (1985)   (balancing  \"the   individual's   legitimate\n\nexpectations  of  privacy  and   personal  security\"  with   \"the\n\ngovernment need for  effective methods to  deal with breaches  of\n\npublic order\" in passing on the validity of a class of searches).\n\n          An officer \"engaged in the often competitive enterprise\n\nof ferreting out crime,\" Johnson, 333 U.S. at 14, has two options\n                                \n\nin cases  such as  this one.    Once the  controlled delivery  of\n\n                               -32-\n                                32\n\ncontraband is complete, he may apply for a search warrant to  the\n\nappropriate  magistrate.   Alternatively, if  an exigency  should\n\narise  in  the  course   of  the  controlled  delivery  requiring\n\nimmediate  action,  the  officer   is  authorized  to  conduct  a\n\nwarrantless   search   pursuant   to   the   well-known   exigent\n\ncircumstances exception  to the  warrant requirement.   In short,\n\nthere  is no  legitimate need  for such  a  novel erosion  of the\n\nFourth Amendment as is promoted by anticipatory search warrants.\n\n          The  majority's analogy  to  warrants for  wiretapping,\n\nante  at 7  n.3, is  misapplied.   When authorizing a  wiretap, a\n    \n\nmagistrate must  observe  \"precise and  discriminate\"  procedures\n\nspecific to wiretaps.   Katz v.

These safeguards  ensure that  \"'no\n\ngreater invasion  of privacy  [is] permitted than  [is] necessary\n\nunder  the circumstances.'\"    Katz,  389  U.S. at  355  (quoting\n                                   \n\nBerger,  388 U.S. at 57).
