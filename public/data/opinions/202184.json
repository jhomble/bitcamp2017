Morris E. Lasker,* Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                        Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                    Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                          Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Edward B.

Edward Knight appeals\n\nfrom the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts.            Knight argues that the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") erred in holding,\n\nfirst, that Knight's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was not\n\nviolated when the state trial court refused to allow him to pursue\n\na   particular    area   of   inquiry   during     cross-examination   of   a\n\nprosecution witness, and, second, that Knight's counsel was not\n\nconstitutionally ineffective.\n\n                               I.    Background\n\n           On     December     31,    1996,   Knight    was   indicted      in\n\nMassachusetts by the Suffolk County Grand Jury for the murder and\n\narmed robbery of Pasquale Candelino.              A jury trial was held in\n\nSuffolk Superior Court, and on June 29, 1998, Knight was found\n\nguilty of armed robbery and first degree murder.              He received a\n\nlife sentence on the murder conviction, and the armed robbery\n\nconviction was placed on file.        On June 30, 1998, Knight appealed.\n\n           On July 25, 2000, Knight filed and later supplemented a\n\nmotion for a new trial.       On May 22, 2001, the Superior Court denied\n\nthe motion.      On May 30, 2001, Knight appealed from the denial of\n\nhis motion for a new trial, and that appeal was consolidated with\n\nthe direct appeal from his conviction.        Both appeals were rejected\n\nby the SJC.      Commonwealth v. Knight, 773 N.E.2d 390 (Mass. 2002).\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f              On July 2, 2003, Knight petitioned the federal district\n\ncourt for a writ of habeas corpus.        After a hearing and following\n\nissuance of a comprehensive memorandum, the district court denied\n\nthe petition.      Knight thereupon filed a notice of appeal and an\n\napplication for a Certificate of Appealability. The district court\n\ngranted   a    Certificate   of   Appealability   for   the   petitioner's\n\nConfrontation Clause and ineffective assistance of counsel claims.\n\n                  II.   Supreme Judicial Court Decision\n\n              A state court's factual findings are presumed to be\n\ncorrect under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).       See Gunter v. Maloney, 291\n\nF.3d 74, 76 (1st Cir. 2002); Coombs v. State of Maine, 202 F.3d 14,\n\n18 (1st Cir. 2000).      The SJC found the following facts in Knight's\n\ncase:\n\n          Pasquale Candelino was a sixty-one year old man who\n     resided in the North End section of Boston.       In the\n     afternoon of Saturday, June 22, 1996, his body was found\n     by his landlord in the bedroom of his apartment. The\n     apartment had been \"ransacked, drawers were open, doors,\n     cabinet doors were open,\" and there was blood on the\n     floor and the walls of the bedroom and bloody\n     fingerprints inside an open drawer. [FN2. These were\n     not identifiable.]\n\n          The medical examiner conducted an autopsy and\n     determined that the victim died of multiple stab wounds\n     to the neck.    [FN3.   The victim had been stabbed ten\n     times in the neck.]         The state of the body's\n     decomposition was consistent with the injuries having\n     been inflicted, and death having occurred, as early as\n     the previous Wednesday, June 19, 1996. [FN4. The body\n     \"was in an early state of decomposition with green/black\n     discoloration of the right side of the head and chest,\"\n     and \"marbling of the skin and skin slippage and wrinkling\n     of the forearms.\"]\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f     Knight and his girlfriend, Betsy Kelley, were drug\naddicts who supported their habits principally by\nshoplifting. They had sold stolen goods to the victim in\nthe past, and had also purchased pills from him.       On\nWednesday evening, June 19, 1996, sometime after 9 P.M.,\nthey were in the North End looking for money to buy\ndrugs.   Their normal hunting grounds, the malls, were\nclosed. They saw the victim on the street, and Knight\nsuggested they rob him. Kelley agreed. She approached\nthe victim and asked if she could use the bathroom in his\napartment. While Kelley was in the victim's apartment\n(and the victim was in his bedroom), Knight rang the door\nbell and Kelley let him in.\n\n     Knight hid behind the refrigerator in the kitchen.\nWhen the victim came out of his bedroom Knight attacked\nhim, pushing him back into the bedroom where a struggle\nensued.   Kelley remained in the kitchen searching for\ndrugs and money. Kelley heard the victim saying, \"Eddie\nwhat - what are you doing? What are you doing?,\" and\n\"Eddie, no.\" She also heard Knight tell the victim to\n\"shut the fuck up.\" After the struggle ended, \"It was\njust quiet,\" and Kelley heard \"drawers opening.\" When\nKnight came out of the bedroom, he had blood on his\nsneakers. Kelley and Knight put drugs and \"stuff\" from\nthe victim's apartment in a black bag, then wiped the\ndoor knobs with their shirts as they were leaving. They\nwent to a friend's apartment, where Knight told Kelley he\nhad killed the victim.\n\n     Late in the evening of the next day, Thursday, June\n20, 1996, Knight, Kelley, and two friends left for\nFlorida on a bus that arrived in Orlando on Saturday\nmorning, June 22, 1996.     Knight and Kelley returned\nseparately to the Boston area the following week. After\ntheir return, they went to the Boston Public Library and\nlooked for newspaper accounts of the murder.          The\narticles they found reported that the police believed the\nmurder to have occurred on Saturday, June 22, 1996, the\nday on which Knight and Kelley arrived in Florida.\nKnight told Kelley not to worry, because \"they have the\ndates wrong.\"\n\n     In September 1996, three detectives came looking for\nKelley at her father's home where she was staying. Her\nfather was not at home, and she did not answer the door.\nAfter the detectives left, Kelley telephoned her father\nand told him that she was in trouble and had been present\n\n                          -4-\n\fwhen Knight had killed someone.        Her father began\narranging for a lawyer to represent her. Kelley's father\ndrove her to a friend's house, and she told the friend\nwhat had happened in the victim's apartment on the night\nof the murder.\n\n     Knight was arrested on December 16, 1996, and was\nindicted on December 31, 1996, for murder in the first\ndegree and armed robbery. The indictment stated that the\nvictim died \"on or about June 21, 1996.\" Kelley was also\nindicted and, as arranged by her lawyer, surrendered to\nthe police on January 2, 1997. After being held in jail\npending trial for more than one year, Kelley agreed to be\ninterviewed by detectives and, in January 1998,\nnegotiated a plea agreement with the Commonwealth. The\nagreement required that she testify at Knight's trial and\nplead guilty to manslaughter. The Commonwealth agreed to\nrecommend an eighteen-month sentence, guaranteeing\nKelley's release from prison shortly after Knight's\ntrial.\n\n     When Kelley was interviewed, she told the detectives\nthat the victim had been robbed and killed on June 19,\n1996, before she and Knight went to Florida. Thereafter,\nthe Commonwealth moved to amend the indictment to change\nthe date of the murder to \"on or about June 19, 1996.\"\nAfter a hearing, the motion judge allowed the amendment\nover Knight's objection.\n\n     At trial, the Commonwealth relied primarily on\nKelley's testimony to establish Knight's guilt.       The\nCommonwealth also introduced evidence of a knife that\npolice seized from Knight when he was arrested on\nunrelated charges on June 27, 1996, five days after the\nvictim's body was found.        The medical examiner's\ntestimony indicated that the knife was not inconsistent\nwith the victim's wounds. The defense relied primarily\non the testimony of six witnesses from the victim's\nneighborhood who testified that they had seen the victim\nat various locations on Thursday, June 20, and Friday,\nJune 21, when the undisputed evidence demonstrated that\nKelley and Knight were on a bus bound for Florida. [FN5.\nThe Commonwealth contended that these witnesses saw the\nvictim often, and were simply mistaken with regard to\nwhen they last saw him.]     The defense contended that\nKelley's testimony was a fabrication induced by the\nCommonwealth's offer of an eighteen-month sentence and by\nher fear of remaining in prison for life if she were\n\n                          -5-\n\f      convicted.   The Commonwealth attempted to rebut this\n      contention by calling the friend to whom Kelley had\n      confided the details of the murder in September, 1996,\n      long before her indictment, arrest, and incarceration.\n\nKnight, 773 N.E.2d at 394-95.\n\n              In its opinion, the SJC considered Knight's claims of\n\ntrial error, including those now included in Knight's habeas\n\npetition.\n\n              Among the latter was Knight's challenge to the ruling by\n\nthe   trial    judge    that      defense    counsel   could   not,   when   cross-\n\nexamining Betsey Kelley, inquire about the effect upon her of the\n\nguilty   verdict       in   the    contemporaneous     state   trial   of    Louise\n\nWoodward, a nineteen-year-old British au pair, found guilty of\n\nsecond-degree murder in the death of an infant in her care.                    The\n\njudge in Woodward's case had subsequently reduced the jury's\n\nverdict to involuntary manslaughter, vacated her life sentence, and\n\nsentenced her to time served.           Knight, 773 N.E.2d at 398, n.9.         The\n\nSJC held that the trial judge's ruling excluding reference to\n\nWoodward's case had not violated Knight's constitutional right to\n\nconfrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution and Article 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the\n\nMassachusetts Constitution.            Id.    The SJC said, inter alia,\n\n      [t]he judge did not improperly limit the defense's cross-\n      examination of Kelley . . . because the jury were\n      presented with sufficient evidence with which to assess\n      her bias and credibility.    She was extensively cross-\n      examined about her drug use, prior convictions of\n      forgery, larceny, and fraud, her plea agreement with the\n      Commonwealth, and her fears about being convicted of\n\n                                            -6-\n\f     murder and incarcerated for life. In this context, we\n     conclude that the judge's ruling excluding the minimally\n     relevant but highly inflammatory line of questions about\n     the Woodward verdict was not error.\n\nId. at 399.\n\n          The SJC also reviewed certain of Knight's claims of\n\nineffective   assistance   of   counsel,   applying   the   \"substantial\n\nlikelihood of a miscarriage of justice\" standard applicable in\n\nappeals of first degree murder convictions in Massachusetts.        See\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, § 33E.      This statutory standard is more\n\nfavorable to the defendant than the federal constitutional standard\n\narticulated by the Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466\n\nU.S. 668 (1984), or the Massachusetts constitutional standard\n\noutlined in Commonweath v. Saferian, 315 N.E.2d 878 (Mass. 1974).\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Wright, 584 N.E.2d 621, 624 (Mass. 1992).        See\n\nalso Mello v. DiPaulo, 295 F.3d 137, 144 (1st Cir. 2002).        The SJC\n\nheld that Knight's counsel was not ineffective but rather had made\n\na tactical decision in choosing not to call a seventh alibi\n\nwitness; that his failure to attempt to impeach Kelley on her\n\ntestimony regarding her use of the phone in the victim's apartment\n\nwas not ineffective; and that defense counsel was not ineffective\n\nin putting forward the defense theory that the victim had died on\n\nFriday, June 21 rather than on Wednesday, June 19.\n\n                III.   District Court's Conclusions\n\n          In its April 21, 2005 unpublished memorandum and order,\n\nthe district court made the following conclusions about the issues\n\n                                  -7-\n\fin Knight's habeas petition.            Regarding the Confrontation Clause\n\nviolation alleged to have resulted from denying cross-examination\n\nabout the case of Louise Woodward, the court held:\n\n     the SJC's decision on the Confrontation Clause was not\n     contrary to or an unreasonable application of the\n     principles articulated in Van Arsdall [Delaware v. Van\n     Arsdall, 475 U.S. 675 (1986)].      The Woodward line of\n     questioning did not involve a \"prototypical form of bias\"\n     like a plea agreement or a sentence reduction, but rather\n     was aimed at demonstrating that a verdict against another\n     teenager in an unrelated case caused Kelley to confess to\n     a crime of which she was innocent. Moreover, the topic\n     of the Woodward verdict was not necessarily \"otherwise\n     appropriate   cross-examination,\"    given   its   highly\n     prejudicial nature and the weak showing of relevance made\n     by the defense.\n\nOn the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the district court\n\nconcluded that Knight's counsel had not been ineffective, holding,\n\namong other rulings, that \"Knight has not shown that the decision\n\nnot to call Danieli [an alibi witness] rendered his counsel non-\n\nfunctional or deprived him of a fair trial.\"                        Regarding the\n\ndecision not to cross-examine Kelley regarding her testimony about\n\nusing the telephone in the victim's apartment, the district court\n\nconcluded    that    \"it   was    not   contrary   to    or    an    unreasonable\n\napplication of federal law for the SJC to conclude that defense\n\ncounsel was not deficient in declining to question Kelley about her\n\nuse of the telephone.\"           Defense counsel's failure to object to\n\nKelley's     prior   consistent     statements     was   not    \"'so     patently\n\nunreasonable that no competent attorney' would have taken this\n\napproach.\"      Finally, the trial strategy not to emphasize the\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fvictim's time of death in the closing was \"within the bounds of\n\nreasonableness.\"\n\n                                IV.    Discussion\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n              \"In reviewing a judgment on a petition for a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus, this Court examines the legal conclusions of the\n\ndistrict court, including the proper standard of review, de novo.\"\n\nNorton   v.    Spencer,   351    F.3d    1,    4   (1st   Cir.   2003).   \"The\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 ('AEDPA')\n\nprevents a federal court from granting an application for writ of\n\nhabeas corpus with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in\n\nstate court unless that adjudication resulted in a decision that\n\nwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\n\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\n\nof the United States.\"      Id.       The \"contrary to\" category \"embraces\n\ncases in which a state court decision directly contravenes Supreme\n\nCourt precedent.\" Mastracchio v. Vose, 274 F.3d 590, 597 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (citation omitted).        The \"unreasonable application category\"\n\nincludes cases in which the state court's decisions, while not\n\n\"contrary     to\"   relevant    Supreme       Court   precedent,   nonetheless\n\nconstitute an \"unreasonable application\" of that precedent.               Id.\n\n              The Supreme Court has said that \"[u]nder the 'contrary\n\nto' clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state\n\ncourt arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f[Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides\n\na case differently than the [Supreme] Court has on a set of\n\nmaterially undistinguishable facts.\"           Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S.\n\n362, 412-13 (2000).       The \"unreasonable application\" analysis,\n\nhowever, affords relief only if \"the state court identifies the\n\ncorrect    governing   legal    principle      from   the   [Supreme]   Court's\n\ndecisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of\n\nthe petitioner's case.\"        Id. at 413.\n\n            A state court need not cite or be aware of Supreme Court\n\nprecedents so long as \"neither the reasoning nor the result of the\n\nstate-court decision contradicts them.\"           Early v. Packer, 537 U.S.\n\n3, 8 (2002).     As noted above, determinations of fact issues shall\n\nbe presumed correct, and the petitioner must rebut the presumption\n\nof correctness by clear and convincing evidence.                 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2254(e)(1).\n\nB.   Confrontation Clause\n\n            Knight argues in his petition for habeas corpus that it\n\nwas a violation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment\n\nto the United States Constitution for the state trial judge to have\n\ndenied him the opportunity on cross-examination to inquire of Betsy\n\nKelley, the chief prosecution witness, whether the guilty verdict\n\nreturned    by   the   jury    in   a   much    publicized     but   unrelated\n\nMassachusetts criminal case, Commonwealth v. Woodward, may have led\n\nher into supporting the government's position.                See Knight, 773\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fN.E.2d at 398, n.9; Commonwealth v. Woodward, 694 N.E.2d 1277\n\n(Mass. 1998).     The defense wished to argue that the subsequently\n\nreduced murder verdict in Woodward -- leaving some to believe the\n\nBritish nanny was wrongly convicted of murdering the infant in her\n\ncare -- persuaded Kelley that it was safer for her, even if Knight\n\nand she were innocent, to lie in the prosecution's favor, i.e., to\n\ntestify    untruthfully       that     Knight    had     killed      the   victim   on\n\nWednesday, June 19, while Kelley was present in the apartment,\n\nrather than to join in Knight's alibi, supported by witnesses, that\n\nthe   victim    was   seen    still     alive    on    Thursday      and   on    Friday\n\nafternoon, by which times Knight and Kelley had taken a bus to\n\nFlorida.    Knight's attorney hoped the jury would analogize Kelley\n\nto Woodward, both of them being nineteen years old and unfamiliar\n\nwith the legal system.              He would argue that, upon hearing of\n\nWoodward's allegedly unjust conviction, Kelley abandoned hope of\n\nprevailing on a truthful defense and opted to go along with the\n\nprosecution in exchange for a highly favorable plea bargain that\n\nensured her own release soon after Knight's trial.1\n\n            The   trial      judge,    however,       refused   to    allow     defense\n\ncounsel    to   refer   to    the     Woodward    case,    ruling     it   was    \"very\n\ncontroversial,\" \"emotionally loaded,\" and insufficiently relevant.\n\n(In upholding the ruling, the SJC characterized the proposed line\n\n\n      1\n      Defense counsel told the court he learned of Kelley's\npossible concern stemming from the Woodward verdict from Kelley's\nattorney.\n\n                                         -11-\n\fof questioning as \"minimally relevant but highly inflammatory,\"\n\nKnight, 773 N.E.2d at 399.)       The trial court ruled that defense\n\ncounsel    could,   however,   inquire    at   length   \"as   to   [Kelley's]\n\nconcerns and fears about conviction, about incarceration, and\n\nanything of that sort.\"\n\n            The Supreme Court has recognized that \"the exposure of a\n\nwitness's motivation in testifying is a proper and important\n\nfunction    of   the   constitutionally     protected    right     of   cross-\n\nexamination.\" Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 674, 678-79 (1986)\n\n(citation omitted).     But the Court also noted that\n\n     [i]t does not follow, of course, that the Confrontation\n     Clause of the Sixth Amendment prevents a trial judge from\n     imposing any limits on defense counsel's inquiry into the\n     potential bias of a prosecution witness.          On the\n     contrary, trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as\n     the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose\n     reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on\n     concerns   about,   among   other   things,   harassment,\n     prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness' safety,\n     or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally\n     relevant.\n\nId. at 679.\n\n            In Van Arsdall, the Supreme Court held that a state court\n\noffends the Confrontation Clause when it prevents the defense from\n\nengaging in:\n\n     otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show\n     a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness,\n     and thereby \"to expose to the jury the facts from which\n     jurors . . . could appropriately draw inferences relating\n     to the reliability of the witness.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f475 U.S. at 680 (quoting Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 318\n\n(1974)).    Regarding this approach, the First Circuit has stated:\n\n     The first question to be asked under the Van Arsdall test\n     is whether the limitation prejudiced the examination of\n     that particular witness.     In other words, absent the\n     limitation, would the jury have received a \"significantly\n     different      impression\"      of     the     witness's\n     credibility? . . . The second element of the Van Arsdall\n     test is whether the error was harmless beyond a\n     reasonable doubt; if so, reversal is not warranted.\n\nDiBenedetto v. Hall, 272 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2001) (citations\n\nomitted).    Knight argues that the SJC and the federal district\n\ncourt erred in upholding the trial court's ruling because Knight\n\nwas precluded from pursuing an entire line of questioning related\n\nto Kelley's views on the Woodward verdict and as a result was\n\nprevented from addressing the crucial question of why she would\n\ntestify against the petitioner if she and he were both innocent of\n\nany wrongdoing.   Knight further observes that the prosecution took\n\nunfair advantage of the fact that the defense had not explained\n\nKelley's reason for testifying against Knight when it argued at\n\nclosing that Kelley's testimony was incredible because an innocent\n\nperson with a good alibi would not falsely claim to have been\n\ninvolved in a murder.\n\n            The district court was plainly correct that the possible\n\neffect on Kelley of the Woodward verdict could not be said to\n\ninvolve a \"prototypical form of bias,\"2 the expression used by the\n\n\n     2\n      The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (2nd ed.\n1987) defines prototypical as the adjectival form of \"prototype:\"\n\n                                -13-\n\fCourt in Van Arsdall.        As the district court found, Knight sought\n\nmerely   to    persuade   the     jury    \"that    a     verdict   against    another\n\nteenager in an unrelated case caused Kelley to confess to a crime\n\nof which she was innocent.\" In the present circumstances, this was\n\nscarcely a \"prototypical form of bias,\" such as a plea agreement or\n\nsentence reduction, as in Van Arsdall, where the defense counsel\n\nwas wrongly prevented from asking a witness about his agreement to\n\ncooperate with the prosecution in exchange for dismissal of a drunk\n\ndriving charge.      475 U.S. at 676.\n\n              The claimed relevance of Woodward was that its publicized\n\njury verdict of second degree murder may have so enhanced Kelley's\n\nfear that she would be convicted of murder and sent away for life\n\nthat, notwithstanding her actual innocence, she lied in order to\n\nsecure   the     favorable    plea      bargain     that    promised    her    almost\n\nimmediate     release.       We   are    not     persuaded,    however,      that    the\n\nintroduction of Woodward into the case would have given the jury a\n\nsignificantly      different      impression        of     Kelley's    credibility.\n\nDiBenedetto, 272 F.3d at 10.             Without Woodward, Knight's counsel\n\nwas still able to point out the extremely attractive nature of the\n\nplea agreement to one in Kelley's shoes, with its assurance of\n\nnearly instant release, coupled with Kelley's natural worry that if\n\nshe   depended    upon    Knight's       alibi    defense    she   might     still   be\n\n\n\"the original or model on which something is based or formed\" or\n\"someone or something that serves to illustrate the typical\nqualities of a class, model; exemplar.\"\n\n                                         -14-\n\fconvicted of murder -- all matters on which cross-examination was\n\nexpressly allowed. Thus, wholly apart from any impact of Woodward,\n\nthe basic components of Knight's challenge to Kelley's credibility\n\nwere available.       And while Woodward was initially convicted of\n\nsecond-degree murder, that verdict was almost immediately vacated,\n\nand Woodward herself released, making it less plausible that that\n\ncase alone would have explained why an innocent Kelley would have\n\ninvented the story she told.         To be sure, reference to Woodward\n\nmight have offered the defense some added color, but it also raised\n\nthe danger of being used as a red herring.           The trial judge found\n\nthe Woodward case to be \"very controversial\" and \"emotionally\n\nloaded in many different ways,\" hence, in effect, a potential\n\ndetour to confusion of the issues.          Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 679\n\n(trial judges retain wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on\n\ncross-examination based on concerns about, among other things,\n\n\"confusion of the issues . . . or interrogation that is . . . only\n\nmarginally relevant.\").        Given the tenuous materiality of the\n\nWoodward case and its potential for jury confusion, we think the\n\ntrial judge's ruling was constitutionally within his discretion.\n\n           Knight compares his situation to that in Davis, but the\n\nanalogy is unpersuasive.      In Davis, the Supreme Court ruled that a\n\nstate   court   had   erred   when   it   refused   to   admit   evidence   of\n\npotential bias of a prosecution witness in the form of the fact\n\nthat the witness was on probation.             415 U.S. at 318.        Here,\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fhowever, Knight was permitted to introduce evidence of Kelley's\n\nprior drug dealing and of her plea agreement.          The information\n\nabout her alleged reaction to the Woodward verdict was not relevant\n\nin the same way, if at all.     The Woodward verdict had no role in\n\nthe case and had nothing to do with Kelley's past history as a drug\n\ndealer and user.\n\n           We think Knight has not demonstrated that the trial\n\ncourt's ruling constituted an unreasonable application of Supreme\n\nCourt law and so violated the Sixth Amendment.\n\nC.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n           Knight also argues that the SJC unreasonably applied\n\nclearly established federal law by failing to accept his claim that\n\nhe   received   ineffective    assistance    of    counsel     at   trial.\n\nSpecifically, he complains about four alleged errors made by his\n\nattorney: (1) counsel's decision not to object to the introduction\n\nof prior consistent statements made by Kelley; (2) counsel's\n\ndecision not to call a seventh alibi witness, Phyllis Danieli; (3)\n\ncounsel's failure to cross-examine Kelley about using the victim's\n\ntelephone; and (4) counsel's argument to the jury concerning the\n\ntime of the victim's death.\n\n           \"A   criminal   defendant    claiming   a   Sixth    Amendment\n\nineffective assistance of counsel violation must establish that (1)\n\n'counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness' and (2) 'a reasonable probability that, but for\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fcounsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would\n\nhave been different.'\"        Smiley v. Maloney, 422 F.3d 17, 20 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 684).             Under the first\n\nprong of Strickland, there is a \"strong presumption\" that counsel's\n\nstrategy     and   tactics   fall   \"within     the   range    of   reasonable\n\nprofessional assistance,\" and courts should avoid second-guessing\n\ncounsel's performance with the use of hindsight.              Strickland, 466\n\nU.S. at 689.\n\n      It is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess\n      counsel's assistance after conviction . . ., and it is\n      all too easy for a court, examining counsel's defense\n      after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a\n      particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.\n\nId.   It is only where, given the facts known at the time, counsel's\n\n\"choice was so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney\n\nwould have made it,\" that the ineffective assistance prong is\n\nsatisfied.     Under the prejudice prong, not all errors by counsel\n\nare sufficient to meet the standard of a reasonable probability\n\nthat, but for the counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding\n\nwould   have   been    different.    Id.   at    693-94.       Rather,   \"'[a]\n\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine\n\nconfidence in the outcome.'\"         Smiley, 422 F.3d at 20 (quoting\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694).         This is a \"highly demanding\" and\n\n\"heavy burden.\"       Williams, 529 U.S. at 393.      A defendant's failure\n\nto satisfy one prong of the Strickland analysis obviates the need\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\ffor a court to consider the remaining prong.    Strickland, 466 U.S.\n\nat 697.\n\n          This Circuit has held that where the SJC applies its more\n\nfavorable \"substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice\"\n\nstandard, its decision will not be deemed to be \"contrary to\" the\n\nStrickland criterion:\n\n     [T]he SJC rejected [the petitioner's] ineffective\n     assistance of counsel claims under a \"substantial\n     likelihood of a miscarriage of justice\" standard that the\n     SJC says is more favorable to a defendant than the\n     Saferian standard, which we have said is the functional\n     equivalent of the Strickland standard.      We therefore\n     conclude that the SJC applied a standard of ineffective\n     assistance of counsel that is at least as favorable to\n     [the petitioner] as the federal standard.\n\nMello v. DiPaulo, 295 F.3d 137, 144 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          To   warrant   habeas    relief   under   the   unreasonable\n\napplication standard, Knight must show that the counsel's work fell\n\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness and that but for the\n\nineffective assistance, the outcome of the case would have been\n\ndifferent. Knight has not made a showing regarding the first prong\n\nwith respect to any of his four ineffective assistance claims, so\n\nwe do not reach the second prong of the analysis.\n\n          i.   Failure to Object to Prior Consistent Statements\n\n          Knight argues that his counsel should have objected to\n\nthe admission of testimony by Kelley stating that she had told her\n\nfather and another person, two months after the victim's death,\n\nthat she had been present when Knight had killed someone.      Knight\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\fargues that these were prior consistent statements that were\n\ninadmissible, but the SJC found that Knight was going to try to\n\nimpeach Kelley and that her statements were, therefore, admissible\n\nto defend against the argument of recent contrivance.                   Knight, 773\n\nN.E.2d at 399-400 (quoting Commonwealth v. Saarela, 383 N.E.2d 501\n\n(Mass. 1978)).       To the extent that Knight argues on appeal that the\n\nSJC erred in affirming the admission of the statements, that claim\n\ndoes not warrant federal habeas review because the SJC, which has\n\nthe final word on questions of Massachusetts state law, affirmed\n\ntheir admission on the basis of state law.             See Estelle v. McGuire,\n\n502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991).              Knight's counsel could not have\n\nrendered ineffective assistance in failing to object to alleged\n\nerrors of state evidentiary law that were either non-prejudicial or\n\nnonexistent.         Vieux v. Pepe, 184 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(\"failing       to   pursue   a     futile    tactic    does     not    amount    to\n\nconstitutional       ineffectiveness\"),       cert.    denied,    528    U.S.    1163\n\n(2000).     Therefore, Knight's counsel was not ineffective when he\n\nfailed    to    object   to   the    admission    of    the    prior    consistent\n\nstatements.\n\n               ii.   Failure to Introduce Testimony of Phyllis Danieli\n\n               Knight argues that his counsel acted ineffectively by\n\nfailing to call Phyllis Danieli as a witness to testify that she\n\nhad seen the victim alive the day before his body was discovered --\n\nwhile Knight was on a bus to Florida.                  Danieli had a distinct\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fmemory of seeing the victim alive because he invited her to stop by\n\nhis apartment that evening, and the next day, when she learned of\n\nhis death, she realized that if she had accepted his invitation,\n\nshe too might have been murdered. However, Danieli, herself a drug\n\nuser, was unable to recall the exact date she had seen the victim.\n\n          The SJC ruled that Knight's trial counsel's decision was\n\nstrategic because Danieli's testimony was both cumulative of six\n\nother witnesses who said they had seen the victim before his body\n\nwas discovered and also subject to severe impeachment because she\n\nhad been arrested previously, had bought and used drugs immediately\n\nafter having coffee with the victim, and could not remember the\n\ndate when she last saw the victim other than it was June.   Knight,\n\n773 N.E.2d at 402.   Knight argues that while the other witnesses\n\nwere subject to attacks on cross-examination because they had seen\n\nthe victim daily for years and could not distinguish one day from\n\nthe next, Danieli had not seen the victim for many years and had\n\nparticular reason to remember the occasion because she realized she\n\nmight have been present at what became the murder scene.    Knight\n\ndismisses her potential credibility problems on the grounds that\n\n\"her failure to remember the precise date (six months after the\n\nfact) was immaterial\" and that the credibility of drug users was an\n\nissue throughout the case since the government's primary witness,\n\nKelley, was herself a drug user.\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f              As noted, however, counsel's performance is strongly\n\npresumed to fall within the range of reasonable professional\n\njudgment.      Counsel was able to see and assess the likely demeanor\n\nand appearance of potential witnesses. Since Knight had called six\n\nalibi      witnesses,    and    since    Danieli     was    open    to    significant\n\nimpeachment, it was appropriate for the SJC, and then the district\n\ncourt, to conclude that the trial counsel's decision was a tactical\n\none rather than the result of ineffective assistance.                       The SJC's\n\ndecision was an \"appropriate application of Strickland's insistence\n\non   the    'wide    latitude     counsel    must    have    in    making    tactical\n\ndecisions.'\"        Horton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75, 86-87 (1st Cir. 2004),\n\ncert.      denied,   543   U.S.    1093     (2005)   (SJC    reasonably       applied\n\nStrickland when it determined that counsel was not ineffective for\n\nfailing to call several witnesses; upholding denial of habeas\n\npetition).\n\n              iii.      Failure     to     Impeach    Kelley       with    \"Telephone\n\nTestimony\"\n\n              Knight    argues    that    his    counsel    was    ineffective   for\n\nfailing to impeach Kelley's inconsistent testimony regarding the\n\nvictim's telephone.            Kelley testified that, despite having been\n\ncareful to leave no fingerprints in the apartment, she did pick up\n\nthe telephone, dial an automatic weather service, and then hide the\n\nphone under some clothes without turning it off.                   These statements\n\nmight have been designed to explain why the victim's phone was \"off\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fthe   hook\"   when    the    landlord     tried     to    reach    him,     and   this\n\nexplanation was cited by the government as evidence of Kelley's\n\ncredibility. Knight now argues that his lawyer failed to introduce\n\nevidence that if Kelley had turned the phone on on Wednesday\n\nevening,   the   phone      battery    would   have      long    since    expired   by\n\nSaturday afternoon, and the landlord's incoming calls would have\n\nbeen met by a ring, not by a busy signal.                       The SJC found that\n\nKelley was not sure whether she had turned off the telephone; that,\n\nassuming she had left the telephone on, there was no probative\n\nevidence that the phone's battery would have been dead by Saturday\n\nafternoon; and that there was no evidence that the victim's phone\n\nwould generate a ring instead of a busy signal when the telephone\n\nbattery died.     Knight, 773 N.E.2d at 402-04.                  In the absence of\n\nclearer    evidence   on     this     issue,   it   was    not    an     unreasonable\n\nstrategic decision by Knight's counsel not to seek to impeach\n\nKelley about the telephone.            If she was unsure about whether she\n\nhad actually turned off the phone, there would be little point to\n\ntry to prove the battery would have been dead.                         Additionally,\n\nKnight's appellate counsel conducted an experiment to try to prove\n\nthat the battery would have been dead, but \"[t]he telephone used in\n\nthe experiment was not the actual phone that was found in the\n\nvictim's apartment, nor [wa]s it clear whether the telephone used\n\nin the experiment was even the same type or was similar in any\n\nrespect to the telephone in the victim's apartment.\"                     Knight, 773\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fN.E.2d at 402-03.        Defense counsel at trial also notably did\n\nexamine Kelley on a number of issues, including her drug use, prior\n\nconvictions, and her plea agreement. \"When counsel focuses on some\n\nissues to the exclusion of others, there is a strong presumption\n\nthat he did so for tactical reasons rather than through sheer\n\nneglect.\"    Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U.S. 1, 8 (2003).             Thus,\n\nKnight's ineffective assistance claim fails on this point.\n\n            iv.   Failure to Argue Effectively the Physical Evidence\n\nRelative to the Time of Death\n\n            Knight argues that his trial counsel failed to make\n\nsufficiently detailed and convincing arguments in support of the\n\npoint that the state of the victim's body was consistent with\n\ndeath's having occurred on Friday night rather than earlier on\n\nWednesday night.        Counsel notes various aspects of the medical\n\nexaminer's testimony which, had they been called to the jury's\n\nattention during closing argument, would or might have created a\n\nstronger case for the proposition that death had not occurred until\n\nthe time consistent with the defense's alibi evidence.\n\n            The right to effective assistance extends to closing\n\narguments, but counsel is allowed wide latitude with regard to\n\n\"which   issues    to    sharpen   and   how   best   to   clarify   them.\"\n\nYarborough, 540 U.S. at 5.         The Supreme Court has made it clear\n\nthat:\n\n     counsel has wide latitude in deciding how best to\n     represent a client, and deference to counsel's tactical\n\n                                    -23-\n\f      decisions in his closing presentation is particularly\n      important because of the broad range of legitimate\n      defense strategy at that stage. Closing arguments should\n      sharpen and clarify the issues for resolution by the\n      trier of fact, but which issues to sharpen and how best\n      to clarify them are questions with many reasonable\n      answers.\n\nId. (internal quotations and citations omitted).                   Courts are thus\n\nhesitant to find that an attorney's decision to leave out reference\n\nto particular aspects of the case in closing argument constitutes\n\nineffective assistance.          Id.   The closing must also be viewed in\n\nthe context of the entire proceeding.              See, e.g., Bell v. Cone, 535\n\nU.S. 685, 699-702 (2002) (analyzing attorney's decision not to make\n\na   summation    in   relation    to   nature      and    timing    of    the    expert\n\nwitnesses' testimony).       In the instant case, the SJC found \"very\n\neffective\"      the   cross-examination       of    the    medical       examiner    by\n\nKnight's counsel, Knight, 773 N.E.2d at 403-04, and the district\n\ncourt wrote that, \"[g]iven this admonition [in Yarborough], and the\n\ndefense   counsel's      detailed      cross-examination           of    the    medical\n\nexaminer as to the victim's time of death, the SJC properly applied\n\nthe Strickland presumption that the trial strategy was within the\n\nbounds of reasonableness.\"         Given the wide latitude of discretion\n\navailable to defense counsel to conduct the defense in the manner\n\nof his or her own choosing, counsel's summation of the time of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fdeath evidence cannot be said to have established ineffective\n\nassistance within Strickland.3\n\n            v.   Cumulative Error\n\n            Knight finally argues that the cumulative effect of his\n\ntrial    attorney's    purported    errors     resulted   in    his    receiving\n\nconstitutionally      deficient    representation.        As   the    government\n\nobserves, he did not make this argument in state court, before the\n\ndistrict    court,     or   in    his     motion   for    a    certificate    of\n\nappealability. The issue is therefore not exhausted pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A) and is not properly before this Court.\n\nFeliciano v.

Knight argues that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") erred in holding, first, that Knight's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was not violated when the state trial court refused to allow him to pursue a particular area of inquiry during cross-examination of a prosecution witness, and, second, that Knight's counsel was not constitutionally ineffective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 31, 1996, Knight was indicted in Massachusetts by the Suffolk County Grand Jury for the murder and armed robbery of Pasquale Candelino. A jury trial was held in Suffolk Superior Court, and on June 29, 1998, Knight was found guilty of armed robbery and first degree murder. He received a life sentence on the murder conviction, and the armed robbery conviction was placed on file. On June 30, 1998, Knight appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 25, 2000, Knight filed and later supplemented a motion for a new trial. On May 22, 2001, the Superior Court denied the motion. On May 30, 2001, Knight appealed from the denial of his motion for a new trial, and that appeal was consolidated with the direct appeal from his conviction. Both appeals were rejected by the SJC. <i>Commonwealth v. Knight,</i> 437 Mass. 487, 773 N.E.2d 390 (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 2, 2003, Knight petitioned the federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus. After a hearing and following issuance of a comprehensive memorandum, the district court denied the petition. Knight thereupon filed a notice of appeal and an application for a Certificate of Appealability. The district court granted a Certificate of Appealability for the petitioner's Confrontation Clause and ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Supreme Judicial Court Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A state court's factual findings are presumed to be correct under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(e)(1). <i>See Gunter v. Maloney,</i> 291 F.3d 74, 76 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Coombs v. State of Maine,</i> 202 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir.2000). The SJC found the following facts in Knight's case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pasquale Candelino was a sixty-one year old man who resided in the North End section of Boston. In the afternoon of Saturday, June 22, 1996, his body was found by his landlord in the bedroom of his apartment. The apartment had been \"ransacked, drawers were open, doors, cabinet doors were open,\" and there was blood on the floor and the walls of the bedroom and bloody fingerprints inside an open drawer. [FN2. These were not identifiable.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The medical examiner conducted an autopsy and determined that the victim died of multiple stab wounds to the neck. [FN3. The victim had been stabbed ten times in the neck.] The state of the body's decomposition was consistent with the injuries having been inflicted, and death having occurred, as early as the previous Wednesday, June 19, 1996. [FN4. The body \"was in an early state of decomposition with green/black discoloration of the right side of the head and chest,\" and \"marbling of the skin and skin slippage and wrinkling of the forearms.\"]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knight and his girlfriend, Betsy Kelley, were drug addicts who supported their habits principally by shoplifting. They had sold stolen goods to the victim in the past, and had also purchased pills from him. On Wednesday evening, June 19, 1996, sometime after 9 P.M., they were in the North End looking for money to buy drugs. Their normal hunting grounds, the malls, were closed. They saw the victim on the street, and Knight suggested they rob him. Kelley agreed. She approached the victim and asked if she could use the bathroom in his apartment. While Kelley was in the victim's apartment (and the victim was in his bedroom), Knight rang the door bell and Kelley let him in.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knight hid behind the refrigerator in the kitchen. When the victim came out of his bedroom Knight attacked him, pushing him back into the bedroom where a struggle ensued. Kelley remained in the kitchen searching for drugs and money. Kelley heard the victim saying, \"Eddie what &#8212; what are you doing? What are you doing?,\" and \"Eddie, no.\" She also heard Knight tell the victim to \"shut the fuck up.\" After the struggle ended, \"It was just quiet,\" and Kelley heard \"drawers opening.\" When Knight came out of the bedroom, he had blood on his sneakers. Kelley and Knight put drugs and \"stuff\" from the victim's apartment in a black bag, then wiped the door knobs with their shirts as they were leaving. They went to a friend's apartment, where Knight told Kelley he had killed the victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Late in the evening of the next day, Thursday, June 20, 1996, Knight, Kelley, and two friends left for Florida on a bus that arrived in Orlando on Saturday morning, June 22, 1996. Knight and Kelley returned separately to the Boston area the following week. After their return, they went to the Boston Public Library and looked for newspaper accounts of the murder. The articles they found reported that the police believed the murder to have occurred on Saturday, June 22, 1996, the day on which Knight and Kelley arrived in Florida. Knight told Kelley not to worry, because \"they have the dates wrong.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1996, three detectives came looking for Kelley at her father's home where she was staying. Her father was not at home, and she did not answer the door. After the detectives left, Kelley telephoned her father and told him that she was in trouble and had been present when Knight had killed someone. Her father began arranging for a lawyer to represent her. Kelley's father drove her to a friend's house, and she told the friend what had happened in the victim's apartment on the night of the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knight was arrested on December 16, 1996, and was indicted on December 31, 1996, for murder in the first degree and armed robbery. The indictment stated that the victim died \"on or about June 21, 1996.\" Kelley was also indicted and, as arranged by her lawyer, surrendered to the police on January 2, 1997. After being held in jail pending trial for more than one year, Kelley agreed to be interviewed by detectives and, in January 1998, negotiated a plea agreement with the Commonwealth. The agreement required that she testify at Knight's trial and plead guilty to manslaughter. The Commonwealth agreed to recommend an eighteen-month sentence, guaranteeing Kelley's release from prison shortly after Knight's trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Kelley was interviewed, she told the detectives that the victim had been robbed and killed on June 19, 1996, before she and Knight went to Florida. Thereafter, the Commonwealth moved to amend the indictment to change the date of the murder to \"on or about June 19, 1996.\" After a hearing, the motion judge allowed the amendment over Knight's objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the Commonwealth relied primarily on Kelley's testimony to establish Knight's guilt. The Commonwealth also introduced evidence of a knife that police seized from Knight when he was arrested on unrelated charges on June 27, 1996, five days after the victim's body was found. The medical examiner's testimony indicated that the knife was not inconsistent with the victim's wounds. The defense relied primarily on the testimony of six witnesses from the victim's neighborhood who testified that they had seen the victim at various locations on Thursday, June 20, and Friday, June 21, when the undisputed evidence demonstrated that Kelley and Knight were on a bus bound for Florida. [FN5. The Commonwealth contended that these witnesses saw the victim often, and were simply mistaken with regard to when they last saw him.] The defense contended that Kelley's testimony was a fabrication induced by the Commonwealth's offer of an eighteen-month sentence and by her fear of remaining in prison for life if she were convicted. The Commonwealth attempted to rebut this contention by calling the friend to whom Kelley had confided the details of the murder in September, 1996, long before her indictment, arrest, and incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Knight,</i> 773 N.E.2d at 394-95.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opinion, the SJC considered Knight's claims of trial error, including those now included in Knight's habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the latter was Knight's challenge to the ruling by the trial judge that defense counsel could not, when cross-examining Betsey Kelley, inquire about the effect upon her of the guilty verdict in the contemporaneous state trial of Louise Woodward, a nineteen-year-old British au pair, found guilty of second-degree murder in the death of an infant in her care. The judge in Woodward's case had subsequently reduced the jury's verdict to involuntary manslaughter, vacated her life sentence, and sentenced her to time served. <i>Knight,</i> 773 N.E.2d at 398, n. 9. The SJC held that the trial judge's ruling excluding reference to Woodward's case had not violated Knight's constitutional right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. <i>Id.</i> The SJC said, inter alia,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he judge did not improperly limit the defense's cross-examination of Kelley. . . because the jury were presented with sufficient evidence with which to assess her bias and credibility. She was extensively cross-examined about her drug use, prior convictions of forgery, larceny, and fraud, her plea agreement with the Commonwealth, and her fears about being convicted of murder and incarcerated for life. In this context, we conclude that the judge's ruling excluding the minimally relevant but highly inflammatory line of questions about the Woodward verdict was not error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 399.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC also reviewed certain of Knight's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, applying the \"substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice\" standard applicable in appeals of first degree murder convictions in Massachusetts. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &#167; 33E. This statutory standard is more favorable to the defendant than the federal constitutional standard articulated by the Supreme Court in <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), or the Massachusetts constitutional standard outlined in <i>Commonweath v. Saferian,</i> 366 Mass. 89, 315 N.E.2d 878 (1974). <i>See Commonwealth v. Wright,</i> 411 Mass. 678, 584 N.E.2d 621, 624 (1992). <i>See also Mello v. DiPaulo,</i> 295 F.3d 137, 144 (1st Cir.2002). The SJC held that Knight's counsel was not ineffective but rather had made a tactical decision in choosing not to call a seventh alibi witness; that his failure to attempt to impeach Kelley on her testimony regarding her use of the phone in the victim's apartment was not ineffective; and that defense counsel was not ineffective in putting forward the defense theory that the victim had died on Friday, June 21 rather than on Wednesday, June 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. District Court's Conclusions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its April 21, 2005 unpublished memorandum and order, the district court made the following conclusions about the issues in Knight's habeas petition. Regarding the Confrontation Clause violation alleged to have resulted from denying cross-examination about the case of Louise Woodward, the court held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the SJC's decision on the Confrontation Clause was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of the principles articulated in <i>Van Arsdall</i> [<i>Delaware v. Van Arsdall,</i> 475 U.S. 673, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986)]. The Woodward line of questioning did not involve a \"prototypical form of bias\" like a plea agreement or a sentence reduction, but rather was aimed at demonstrating that a verdict against another teenager in an unrelated case caused Kelley to confess to a crime of which she was innocent. Moreover, the topic of the Woodward verdict was not necessarily \"otherwise appropriate cross-examination,\" given its highly prejudicial nature and the weak showing of relevance made by the defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the district court concluded that Knight's counsel had not been ineffective, holding, among other rulings, that \"Knight has not shown that the decision not to call Danieli [an alibi witness] rendered his counsel non-functional or deprived him of a fair trial.\" Regarding the decision not to cross-examine Kelley regarding her testimony about using the telephone in the victim's apartment, the district court concluded that \"it was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law for the SJC to conclude that defense counsel was not deficient in declining to question Kelley about her use of the telephone.\" Defense counsel's failure to object to Kelley's prior consistent statements was not \"`so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney' would have taken this approach.\" Finally, the trial strategy not to emphasize the victim's time of death in the closing was \"within the bounds of reasonableness.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In reviewing a judgment on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, this Court examines the legal conclusions of the district court, including the proper standard of review, de novo.\" <i>Norton v. Spencer,</i> 351 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2003). \"The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (`AEDPA') prevents a federal court from granting an application for writ of habeas corpus with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless that adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> The \"contrary to\" category \"embraces cases in which a state court decision directly contravenes Supreme Court precedent.\" <i>Mastracchio v. Vose,</i> 274 F.3d 590, 597 (1st Cir.2001) (citation omitted). The \"unreasonable application category\" includes cases in which the state court's decisions, while not \"contrary to\" relevant Supreme Court precedent, nonetheless constitute an \"unreasonable application\" of that precedent. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has said that \"[u]nder the `contrary to' clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the [Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the [Supreme] Court has on a set of materially undistinguishable facts.\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). The \"unreasonable application\" analysis, however, affords relief only if \"the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the [Supreme] Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the petitioner's case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A state court need not cite or be aware of Supreme Court precedents so long as \"neither the reasoning nor the result of the state-court decision contradicts them.\" <i>Early v. Packer,</i> 537 U.S. 3, 8, 123 S.Ct. 362, 154 L.Ed.2d 263 (2002). As noted above, determinations of fact issues shall be presumed correct, and the petitioner must rebut the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(e)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Confrontation Clause</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knight argues in his petition for habeas corpus that it was a violation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution for the state trial judge to have denied him the opportunity on cross-examination to inquire of Betsy Kelley, the chief prosecution witness, whether the guilty verdict returned by the jury in a much publicized but unrelated Massachusetts criminal case, <i>Commonwealth v. Woodward,</i> may have led her into supporting the government's position. <i>See Knight,</i> 773 N.E.2d at 398, n. 9; <i>Commonwealth v. Woodward,</i> 427 Mass. 659, 694 N.E.2d 1277 (1998). The defense wished to argue that the subsequently reduced murder verdict in <i>Woodward</i> &#8212; leaving some to believe the British nanny was wrongly convicted of murdering the infant in her care &#8212; persuaded Kelley that it was safer for her, even if Knight and she were innocent, to lie in the prosecution's favor, i.e., to testify untruthfully that Knight had killed the victim on Wednesday, June 19, while Kelley was present in the apartment, rather than to join in Knight's alibi, supported by witnesses, that the victim was seen still alive on Thursday and on Friday afternoon, by which times Knight and Kelley had taken a bus to Florida. Knight's attorney hoped the jury would analogize Kelley to Woodward, both of them being nineteen years old and unfamiliar with the legal system. He would argue that, upon hearing of Woodward's allegedly unjust conviction, Kelley abandoned hope of prevailing on a truthful defense and opted to go along with the prosecution in exchange for a highly favorable plea bargain that ensured her own release soon after Knight's trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge, however, refused to allow defense counsel to refer to the <i>Woodward</i> case, ruling it was \"very controversial,\" \"emotionally loaded,\" and insufficiently relevant. (In upholding the ruling, the SJC characterized the proposed line of questioning as \"minimally relevant but highly inflammatory,\" <i>Knight,</i> 773 N.E.2d at 399.) The trial court ruled that defense counsel could, however, inquire at length \"as to [Kelley's] concerns and fears about conviction, about incarceration, and anything of that sort.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has recognized that \"the exposure of a witness's motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination.\" <i>Delaware v. Van Arsdall,</i> 475 U.S. 673, 678-79, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (citation omitted).

On the contrary, trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness' safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Van Arsdall,</i> the Supreme Court held that a state court offends the Confrontation Clause when it prevents the defense from engaging in:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness, and thereby \"to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">475 U.S. at 680, 106 S.Ct. 1431 (quoting <i>Davis v.

In other words, absent the limitation, would the jury have received a \"significantly different impression\" of the witness's credibility?. . . The second element of the <i>Van Arsdall</i> test is whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; if so, reversal is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>DiBenedetto v. Hall,</i> 272 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2001) (citations omitted). Knight argues that the SJC and the federal district court erred in upholding the trial court's ruling because Knight was precluded from pursuing an entire line of questioning related to Kelley's views on the <i>Woodward</i> verdict and as a result was prevented from addressing the crucial question of why she would testify against the petitioner if she and he were both innocent of any wrongdoing. Knight further observes that the prosecution took unfair advantage of the fact that the defense had not explained Kelley's reason for testifying against Knight when it argued at closing that Kelley's testimony was incredible because an innocent person with a good alibi would not falsely claim to have been involved in a murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was plainly correct that the possible effect on Kelley of the <i>Woodward</i> verdict could not be said to involve a \"prototypical form of bias,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the expression used by the Court in <i>Van Arsdall.</i> As the district court found, Knight sought merely to persuade the jury \"that a verdict against another teenager in an unrelated case caused Kelley to confess to a crime of which she was innocent.\" In the present circumstances, this was scarcely a \"prototypical form of bias,\" such as a plea agreement or sentence reduction, as in <i>Van Arsdall,</i> where the defense counsel was wrongly prevented from asking a witness about his agreement to cooperate with the prosecution in exchange for dismissal of a drunk driving charge. 475 U.S. at 676, 106 S.Ct. 1431.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claimed relevance of <i>Woodward</i> was that its publicized jury verdict of second degree murder may have so enhanced Kelley's fear that she would be convicted of murder and sent away for life that, notwithstanding her actual innocence, she lied in order to secure the favorable plea bargain that promised her almost immediate release. We are not persuaded, however, that the introduction of <i>Woodward</i> into the case would have given the jury a significantly different impression of Kelley's credibility. <i>DiBenedetto,</i> 272 F.3d at 10. Without <i>Woodward,</i> Knight's counsel was still able to point out the extremely attractive nature of the plea agreement to one in Kelley's shoes, with its assurance of nearly instant release, coupled with Kelley's natural worry that if she depended upon Knight's alibi defense she might still be convicted of murder &#8212; all matters on which cross-examination was expressly allowed. Thus, wholly apart from any impact of <i>Woodward,</i> the basic components of Knight's challenge to Kelley's credibility were available. And while Woodward was initially convicted of second-degree murder, that verdict was almost immediately vacated, and Woodward herself released, making it less plausible that that case alone would have explained why an innocent Kelley would have invented the story she told. To be sure, reference to <i>Woodward</i> might have offered the defense some added color, but it also raised the danger of being used as a red herring. The trial judge found the <i>Woodward</i> case to be \"very controversial\" and \"emotionally loaded in many different ways,\" hence, in effect, a potential detour to confusion of the issues. <i>Van Arsdall,</i> 475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431 (trial judges retain wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, \"confusion of the issues . . . or interrogation that is . . . only marginally relevant.\"). Given the tenuous materiality of the <i>Woodward</i> case and its potential for jury confusion, we think the trial judge's ruling was constitutionally within his discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knight compares his situation to that in <i>Davis,</i> but the analogy is unpersuasive. In <i>Davis,</i> the Supreme Court ruled that a state court had erred when it refused to admit evidence of potential bias of a prosecution witness in the form of the fact that the witness was on probation. 415 U.S. at 318, 94 S.Ct. 1105. Here, however, Knight was permitted to introduce evidence of Kelley's prior drug dealing and of her plea agreement. The information about her alleged reaction to the <i>Woodward</i> verdict was not relevant in the same way, if at all. The <i>Woodward</i> verdict had no role in the case and had nothing to do with Kelley's past history as a drug dealer and user.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think Knight has not demonstrated that the trial court's ruling constituted an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law and so violated the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knight also argues that the SJC unreasonably applied clearly established federal law by failing to accept his claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. Specifically, he complains about four alleged errors made by his attorney: (1) counsel's decision not to object to the introduction of prior consistent statements made by Kelley; (2) counsel's decision not to call a seventh alibi witness, Phyllis Danieli; (3) counsel's failure to cross-examine Kelley about using the victim's telephone; and (4) counsel's argument to the jury concerning the time of the victim's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A criminal defendant claiming a Sixth Amendment ineffective assistance of counsel violation must establish that (1) `counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness' and (2) `a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.'\" <i>Smiley v. Maloney,</i> 422 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 684, 104 S.Ct. 2052). Under the first prong of <i>Strickland,</i> there is a \"strong presumption\" that counsel's strategy and tactics fall \"within the range of reasonable professional assistance,\" and courts should avoid second-guessing counsel's performance with the use of hindsight. <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel's assistance after conviction . . ., and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel's defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> It is only where, given the facts known at the time, counsel's \"choice was so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have made it,\" that the ineffective assistance prong is satisfied. Under the prejudice prong, not all errors by counsel are sufficient to meet the standard of a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <i>Id.</i> at 693-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Rather, \"`[a] reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.'\" <i>Smiley,</i> 422 F.3d at 20 (quoting <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052). This is a \"highly demanding\" and \"heavy burden.\" <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 393, 120 S.Ct. 1495. A defendant's failure to satisfy one prong of the <i>Strickland</i> analysis obviates the need for a court to consider the remaining prong. <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Circuit has held that where the SJC applies its more favorable \"substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice\" standard, its decision will not be deemed to be \"contrary to\" the <i>Strickland</i> criterion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he SJC rejected [the petitioner's] ineffective assistance of counsel claims under a \"substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice\" standard that the SJC says is more favorable to a defendant than the <i>Saferian</i> standard, which we have said is the functional equivalent of the <i>Strickland</i> standard.

Failure to Object to Prior Consistent Statements</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knight argues that his counsel should have objected to the admission of testimony by Kelley stating that she had told her father and another person, two months after the victim's death, that she had been present when Knight had killed someone. Knight argues that these were prior consistent statements that were inadmissible, but the SJC found that Knight was going to try to impeach Kelley and that her statements were, therefore, admissible to defend against the argument of recent contrivance. <i>Knight,</i> 773 N.E.2d at 399-400 (quoting <i>Commonwealth v. Saarela,</i> 376 Mass. 720, 383 N.E.2d 501 (1978)). To the extent that Knight argues on appeal that the SJC erred in affirming the admission of the statements, that claim does not warrant federal habeas review because the SJC, which has the final word on questions of Massachusetts state law, affirmed their admission on the basis of state law. <i>See Estelle v. McGuire,</i> 502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). Knight's counsel could not have rendered ineffective assistance in failing to object to alleged errors of state evidentiary law that were either non-prejudicial or nonexistent. <i>Vieux v. Pepe,</i> 184 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir.1999) (\"failing to pursue a futile tactic does not amount to constitutional ineffectiveness\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> 528 U.S. 1163, 120 S.Ct. 1178, 145 L.Ed.2d 1086 (2000). Therefore, Knight's counsel was not ineffective when he failed to object to the admission of the prior consistent statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii. Failure to Introduce Testimony of Phyllis Danieli</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knight argues that his counsel acted ineffectively by failing to call Phyllis Danieli as a witness to testify that she had seen the victim alive the day before his body was discovered &#8212; while Knight was on a bus to Florida. Danieli had a distinct memory of seeing the victim alive because he invited her to stop by his apartment that evening, and the next day, when she learned of his death, she realized that if she had accepted his invitation, she too might have been murdered. However, Danieli, herself a drug user, was unable to recall the exact date she had seen the victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC ruled that Knight's trial counsel's decision was strategic because Danieli's testimony was both cumulative of six other witnesses who said they had seen the victim before his body was discovered and also subject to severe impeachment because she had been arrested previously, had bought and used drugs immediately after having coffee with the victim, and could not remember the date when she last saw the victim other than it was June. <i>Knight,</i> 773 N.E.2d at 402. Knight argues that while the other witnesses were subject to attacks on cross-examination because they had seen the victim daily for years and could not distinguish one day from the next, Danieli had not seen the victim for many years and had particular reason to remember the occasion because she realized she might have been present at what became the murder scene. Knight dismisses her potential credibility problems on the grounds that \"her failure to remember the precise date (six months after the fact) was immaterial\" and that the credibility of drug users was an issue throughout the case since the government's primary witness, Kelley, was herself a drug user.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, however, counsel's performance is strongly presumed to fall within the range of reasonable professional judgment. Counsel was able to see and assess the likely demeanor and appearance of potential witnesses. Since Knight had called six alibi witnesses, and since Danieli was open to significant impeachment, it was appropriate for the SJC, and then the district court, to conclude that the trial counsel's decision was a tactical one rather than the result of ineffective assistance. The SJC's decision was an \"appropriate application of <i>Strickland's</i> insistence on the `wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions.'\" <i>Horton v. Allen,</i> 370 F.3d 75, 86-87 (1st Cir.2004), <i>cert. denied,</i> 543 U.S. 1093, 125 S.Ct. 971, 160 L.Ed.2d 905 (2005) (SJC reasonably applied <i>Strickland</i> when it determined that counsel was not ineffective for failing to call several witnesses; upholding denial of habeas petition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iii. Failure to Impeach Kelley with \"Telephone Testimony\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knight argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach Kelley's inconsistent testimony regarding the victim's telephone. Kelley testified that, despite having been careful to leave no fingerprints in the apartment, she did pick up the telephone, dial an automatic weather service, and then hide the phone under some clothes without turning it off. These statements might have been designed to explain why the victim's phone was \"off the hook\" when the landlord tried to reach him, and this explanation was cited by the government as evidence of Kelley's credibility. Knight now argues that his lawyer failed to introduce evidence that if Kelley had turned the phone on on Wednesday evening, the phone battery would have long since expired by Saturday afternoon, and the landlord's incoming calls would have been met by a ring, not by a busy signal. The SJC found that Kelley was not sure whether she had turned off the telephone; that, assuming she had left the telephone on, there was no probative evidence that the phone's battery would have been dead by Saturday afternoon; and that there was no evidence that the victim's phone would generate a ring instead of a busy signal when the telephone battery died. <i>Knight,</i> 773 N.E.2d at 402-04. In the absence of clearer evidence on this issue, it was not an unreasonable strategic decision by Knight's counsel not to seek to impeach Kelley about the telephone. If she was unsure about whether she had actually turned off the phone, there would be little point to try to prove the battery would have been dead. Additionally, Knight's appellate counsel conducted an experiment to try to prove that the battery would have been dead, but \"[t]he telephone used in the experiment was not the actual phone that was found in the victim's apartment, nor [wa]s it clear whether the telephone used in the experiment was even the same type or was similar in any respect to the telephone in the victim's apartment.\" <i>Knight,</i> 773 N.E.2d at 402-03. Defense counsel at trial also notably did examine Kelley on a number of issues, including her drug use, prior convictions, and her plea agreement. \"When counsel focuses on some issues to the exclusion of others, there is a strong presumption that he did so for tactical reasons rather than through sheer neglect.\" <i>Yarborough v. Gentry,</i> 540 U.S. 1, 8, 124 S.Ct. 1, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003). Thus, Knight's ineffective assistance claim fails on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iv. Failure to Argue Effectively the Physical Evidence Relative to the Time of Death</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knight argues that his trial counsel failed to make sufficiently detailed and convincing arguments in support of the point that the state of the victim's body was consistent with death's having occurred on Friday night rather than earlier on Wednesday night. Counsel notes various aspects of the medical examiner's testimony which, had they been called to the jury's attention during closing argument, would or might have created a stronger case for the proposition that death had not occurred until the time consistent with the defense's alibi evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right to effective assistance extends to closing arguments, but counsel is allowed wide latitude with regard to \"which issues to sharpen and how best to clarify them.\" <i>Yarborough,</i> 540 U.S. at 5, 124 S.Ct. 1. The Supreme Court has made it clear that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">counsel has wide latitude in deciding how best to represent a client, and deference to counsel's tactical decisions in his closing presentation is particularly important because of the broad range of legitimate defense strategy at that stage. Closing arguments should sharpen and clarify the issues for resolution by the trier of fact, but which issues to sharpen and how best to clarify them are questions with many reasonable answers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (internal quotations and citations omitted). Courts are thus hesitant to find that an attorney's decision to leave out reference to particular aspects of the case in closing argument constitutes ineffective assistance. <i>Id.</i> The closing must also be viewed in the context of the entire proceeding. <i>See, e.g., Bell v. Cone,</i> 535 U.S. 685, 699-702, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002) (analyzing attorney's decision not to make a summation in relation to nature and timing of the expert witnesses' testimony). In the instant case, the SJC found \"very effective\" the cross-examination of the medical examiner by Knight's counsel, <i>Knight,</i> 773 N.E.2d at 403-04, and the district court wrote that, \"[g]iven this admonition [in <i>Yarborough</i>], and the defense counsel's detailed cross-examination of the medical examiner as to the victim's time of death, the SJC properly applied the <i>Strickland</i> presumption that the trial strategy was within the bounds of reasonableness.\" Given the wide latitude of discretion available to defense counsel to conduct the defense in the manner of his or her own choosing, counsel's summation of the time of death evidence cannot be said to have established ineffective assistance within <i>Strickland.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">v.

As the government observes, he did not make this argument in state court, before the district court, or in his motion for a certificate of appealability. The issue is therefore not exhausted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(b)(1)(A) and is not properly before this Court. <i>Feliciano v.

Knight argues that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") erred in holding, first, that Knight's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was not violated when the state trial court refused to allow him to pursue a particular area of inquiry during cross-examination of a prosecution witness, and, second, that Knight's counsel was not constitutionally ineffective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 31, 1996, Knight was indicted in Massachusetts by the Suffolk County Grand Jury for the murder and armed robbery of Pasquale Candelino. A jury trial was held in Suffolk Superior Court, and on June 29, 1998, Knight was found guilty of armed robbery and first degree murder. He received a life sentence on the murder conviction, and the armed robbery conviction was placed on file.

On May 22, 2001, the Superior Court denied the motion. On May 30, 2001, Knight appealed from the denial of his motion for a new trial, and that appeal was consolidated with the direct appeal from his conviction. Both appeals were rejected by the SJC. <i>Commonwealth v.

After a hearing and following issuance of a comprehensive memorandum, the district court denied the petition.

They had sold stolen goods to the victim in the past, and had also purchased pills from him. On Wednesday evening, June 19, 1996, sometime after 9 P.M., they were in the North End looking for money to buy drugs. Their normal hunting grounds, the malls, were closed. They saw the victim on the street, and Knight suggested they rob him. Kelley agreed. She approached the victim and asked if she could use the bathroom in his apartment. While Kelley was in the victim's apartment (and the victim was in his bedroom), Knight rang the door bell and Kelley let him in.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knight hid behind the refrigerator in the kitchen. When the victim came out of his bedroom Knight attacked him, pushing him back into the bedroom where a struggle ensued. Kelley remained in the kitchen searching for drugs and money. Kelley heard the victim saying, \"Eddie what &#8212; what are you doing? What are you doing?,\" and \"Eddie, no.\" She also heard Knight tell the victim to \"shut the fuck up.\" After the struggle ended, \"It was just quiet,\" and Kelley heard \"drawers opening.\" When Knight came out of the bedroom, he had blood on his sneakers. Kelley and Knight put drugs and \"stuff\" from the victim's apartment in a black bag, then wiped the door knobs with their shirts as they were leaving. They went to a friend's apartment, where Knight told Kelley he had killed the victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Late in the evening of the next day, Thursday, June 20, 1996, Knight, Kelley, and two friends left for Florida on a bus that arrived in Orlando on Saturday morning, June 22, 1996. Knight and Kelley returned separately to the Boston area the following week. After their return, they went to the Boston Public Library and looked for newspaper accounts of the murder. The articles they found reported that the police believed the murder to have occurred on Saturday, June 22, 1996, the day on which Knight and Kelley arrived in Florida. Knight told Kelley not to worry, because \"they have the dates wrong.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1996, three detectives came looking for Kelley at her father's home where she was staying. Her father was not at home, and she did not answer the door. After the detectives left, Kelley telephoned her father and told him that she was in trouble and had been present when Knight had killed someone. Her father began arranging for a lawyer to represent her. Kelley's father drove her to a friend's house, and she told the friend what had happened in the victim's apartment on the night of the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knight was arrested on December 16, 1996, and was indicted on December 31, 1996, for murder in the first degree and armed robbery. The indictment stated that the victim died \"on or about June 21, 1996.\" Kelley was also indicted and, as arranged by her lawyer, surrendered to the police on January 2, 1997. After being held in jail pending trial for more than one year, Kelley agreed to be interviewed by detectives and, in January 1998, negotiated a plea agreement with the Commonwealth. The agreement required that she testify at Knight's trial and plead guilty to manslaughter. The Commonwealth agreed to recommend an eighteen-month sentence, guaranteeing Kelley's release from prison shortly after Knight's trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Kelley was interviewed, she told the detectives that the victim had been robbed and killed on June 19, 1996, before she and Knight went to Florida. Thereafter, the Commonwealth moved to amend the indictment to change the date of the murder to \"on or about June 19, 1996.\" After a hearing, the motion judge allowed the amendment over Knight's objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the Commonwealth relied primarily on Kelley's testimony to establish Knight's guilt. The Commonwealth also introduced evidence of a knife that police seized from Knight when he was arrested on unrelated charges on June 27, 1996, five days after the victim's body was found. The medical examiner's testimony indicated that the knife was not inconsistent with the victim's wounds. The defense relied primarily on the testimony of six witnesses from the victim's neighborhood who testified that they had seen the victim at various locations on Thursday, June 20, and Friday, June 21, when the undisputed evidence demonstrated that Kelley and Knight were on a bus bound for Florida. [FN5. The Commonwealth contended that these witnesses saw the victim often, and were simply mistaken with regard to when they last saw him.] The defense contended that Kelley's testimony was a fabrication induced by the Commonwealth's offer of an eighteen-month sentence and by her fear of remaining in prison for life if she were convicted. The Commonwealth attempted to rebut this contention by calling the friend to whom Kelley had confided the details of the murder in September, 1996, long before her indictment, arrest, and incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Knight,</i> 773 N.E.2d at 394-95.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opinion, the SJC considered Knight's claims of trial error, including those now included in Knight's habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the latter was Knight's challenge to the ruling by the trial judge that defense counsel could not, when cross-examining Betsey Kelley, inquire about the effect upon her of the guilty verdict in the contemporaneous state trial of Louise Woodward, a nineteen-year-old British au pair, found guilty of second-degree murder in the death of an infant in her care. The judge in Woodward's case had subsequently reduced the jury's verdict to involuntary manslaughter, vacated her life sentence, and sentenced her to time served. <i>Knight,</i> 773 N.E.2d at 398, n. 9. The SJC held that the trial judge's ruling excluding reference to Woodward's case had not violated Knight's constitutional right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. <i>Id.</i> The SJC said, inter alia,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he judge did not improperly limit the defense's cross-examination of Kelley. . . because the jury were presented with sufficient evidence with which to assess her bias and credibility. She was extensively cross-examined about her drug use, prior convictions of forgery, larceny, and fraud, her plea agreement with the Commonwealth, and her fears about being convicted of murder and incarcerated for life. In this context, we conclude that the judge's ruling excluding the minimally relevant but highly inflammatory line of questions about the Woodward verdict was not error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 399.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC also reviewed certain of Knight's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, applying the \"substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice\" standard applicable in appeals of first degree murder convictions in Massachusetts. <i>See</i> Mass.

The Woodward line of questioning did not involve a \"prototypical form of bias\" like a plea agreement or a sentence reduction, but rather was aimed at demonstrating that a verdict against another teenager in an unrelated case caused Kelley to confess to a crime of which she was innocent. Moreover, the topic of the Woodward verdict was not necessarily \"otherwise appropriate cross-examination,\" given its highly prejudicial nature and the weak showing of relevance made by the defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the district court concluded that Knight's counsel had not been ineffective, holding, among other rulings, that \"Knight has not shown that the decision not to call Danieli [an alibi witness] rendered his counsel non-functional or deprived him of a fair trial.\" Regarding the decision not to cross-examine Kelley regarding her testimony about using the telephone in the victim's apartment, the district court concluded that \"it was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law for the SJC to conclude that defense counsel was not deficient in declining to question Kelley about her use of the telephone.\" Defense counsel's failure to object to Kelley's prior consistent statements was not \"`so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney' would have taken this approach.\" Finally, the trial strategy not to emphasize the victim's time of death in the closing was \"within the bounds of reasonableness.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

The defense wished to argue that the subsequently reduced murder verdict in <i>Woodward</i> &#8212; leaving some to believe the British nanny was wrongly convicted of murdering the infant in her care &#8212; persuaded Kelley that it was safer for her, even if Knight and she were innocent, to lie in the prosecution's favor, i.e., to testify untruthfully that Knight had killed the victim on Wednesday, June 19, while Kelley was present in the apartment, rather than to join in Knight's alibi, supported by witnesses, that the victim was seen still alive on Thursday and on Friday afternoon, by which times Knight and Kelley had taken a bus to Florida. Knight's attorney hoped the jury would analogize Kelley to Woodward, both of them being nineteen years old and unfamiliar with the legal system. He would argue that, upon hearing of Woodward's allegedly unjust conviction, Kelley abandoned hope of prevailing on a truthful defense and opted to go along with the prosecution in exchange for a highly favorable plea bargain that ensured her own release soon after Knight's trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge, however, refused to allow defense counsel to refer to the <i>Woodward</i> case, ruling it was \"very controversial,\" \"emotionally loaded,\" and insufficiently relevant.

Knight further observes that the prosecution took unfair advantage of the fact that the defense had not explained Kelley's reason for testifying against Knight when it argued at closing that Kelley's testimony was incredible because an innocent person with a good alibi would not falsely claim to have been involved in a murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was plainly correct that the possible effect on Kelley of the <i>Woodward</i> verdict could not be said to involve a \"prototypical form of bias,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the expression used by the Court in <i>Van Arsdall.</i> As the district court found, Knight sought merely to persuade the jury \"that a verdict against another teenager in an unrelated case caused Kelley to confess to a crime of which she was innocent.\" In the present circumstances, this was scarcely a \"prototypical form of bias,\" such as a plea agreement or sentence reduction, as in <i>Van Arsdall,</i> where the defense counsel was wrongly prevented from asking a witness about his agreement to cooperate with the prosecution in exchange for dismissal of a drunk driving charge. 475 U.S. at 676, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111625\"><a href=\"/opinion/111625/delaware-v-van-arsdall/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We are not persuaded, however, that the introduction of <i>Woodward</i> into the case would have given the jury a significantly different impression of Kelley's credibility. <i>DiBenedetto,</i> 272 F.3d at 10. Without <i>Woodward,</i> Knight's counsel was still able to point out the extremely attractive nature of the plea agreement to one in Kelley's shoes, with its assurance of nearly instant release, coupled with Kelley's natural worry that if she depended upon Knight's alibi defense she might still be convicted of murder &#8212; all matters on which cross-examination was expressly allowed. Thus, wholly apart from any impact of <i>Woodward,</i> the basic components of Knight's challenge to Kelley's credibility were available. And while Woodward was initially convicted of second-degree murder, that verdict was almost immediately vacated, and Woodward herself released, making it less plausible that that case alone would have explained why an innocent Kelley would have invented the story she told. To be sure, reference to <i>Woodward</i> might have offered the defense some added color, but it also raised the danger of being used as a red herring. The trial judge found the <i>Woodward</i> case to be \"very controversial\" and \"emotionally loaded in many different ways,\" hence, in effect, a potential detour to confusion of the issues. <i>Van Arsdall,</i> 475 U.S. at 679, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111625\"><a href=\"/opinion/111625/delaware-v-van-arsdall/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The information about her alleged reaction to the <i>Woodward</i> verdict was not relevant in the same way, if at all. The <i>Woodward</i> verdict had no role in the case and had nothing to do with Kelley's past history as a drug dealer and user.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think Knight has not demonstrated that the trial court's ruling constituted an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law and so violated the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

Danieli had a distinct memory of seeing the victim alive because he invited her to stop by his apartment that evening, and the next day, when she learned of his death, she realized that if she had accepted his invitation, she too might have been murdered. However, Danieli, herself a drug user, was unable to recall the exact date she had seen the victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC ruled that Knight's trial counsel's decision was strategic because Danieli's testimony was both cumulative of six other witnesses who said they had seen the victim before his body was discovered and also subject to severe impeachment because she had been arrested previously, had bought and used drugs immediately after having coffee with the victim, and could not remember the date when she last saw the victim other than it was June. <i>Knight,</i> 773 N.E.2d at 402. Knight argues that while the other witnesses were subject to attacks on cross-examination because they had seen the victim daily for years and could not distinguish one day from the next, Danieli had not seen the victim for many years and had particular reason to remember the occasion because she realized she might have been present at what became the murder scene. Knight dismisses her potential credibility problems on the grounds that \"her failure to remember the precise date (six months after the fact) was immaterial\" and that the credibility of drug users was an issue throughout the case since the government's primary witness, Kelley, was herself a drug user.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, however, counsel's performance is strongly presumed to fall within the range of reasonable professional judgment. Counsel was able to see and assess the likely demeanor and appearance of potential witnesses. Since Knight had called six alibi witnesses, and since Danieli was open to significant impeachment, it was appropriate for the SJC, and then the district court, to conclude that the trial counsel's decision was a tactical one rather than the result of ineffective assistance. The SJC's decision was an \"appropriate application of <i>Strickland's</i> insistence on the `wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions.'\" <i>Horton v.

Kelley testified that, despite having been careful to leave no fingerprints in the apartment, she did pick up the telephone, dial an automatic weather service, and then hide the phone under some clothes without turning it off. These statements might have been designed to explain why the victim's phone was \"off the hook\" when the landlord tried to reach him, and this explanation was cited by the government as evidence of Kelley's credibility. Knight now argues that his lawyer failed to introduce evidence that if Kelley had turned the phone on on Wednesday evening, the phone battery would have long since expired by Saturday afternoon, and the landlord's incoming calls would have been met by a ring, not by a busy signal. The SJC found that Kelley was not sure whether she had turned off the telephone; that, assuming she had left the telephone on, there was no probative evidence that the phone's battery would have been dead by Saturday afternoon; and that there was no evidence that the victim's phone would generate a ring instead of a busy signal when the telephone battery died. <i>Knight,</i> 773 N.E.2d at 402-04. In the absence of clearer evidence on this issue, it was not an unreasonable strategic decision by Knight's counsel not to seek to impeach Kelley about the telephone. If she was unsure about whether she had actually turned off the phone, there would be little point to try to prove the battery would have been dead. Additionally, Knight's appellate counsel conducted an experiment to try to prove that the battery would have been dead, but \"[t]he telephone used in the experiment was not the actual phone that was found in the victim's apartment, nor [wa]s it clear whether the telephone used in the experiment was even the same type or was similar in any respect to the telephone in the victim's apartment.\" <i>Knight,</i> 773 N.E.2d at 402-03. Defense counsel at trial also notably did examine Kelley on a number of issues, including her drug use, prior convictions, and her plea agreement. \"When counsel focuses on some issues to the exclusion of others, there is a strong presumption that he did so for tactical reasons rather than through sheer neglect.\" <i>Yarborough v.

Counsel notes various aspects of the medical examiner's testimony which, had they been called to the jury's attention during closing argument, would or might have created a stronger case for the proposition that death had not occurred until the time consistent with the defense's alibi evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right to effective assistance extends to closing arguments, but counsel is allowed wide latitude with regard to \"which issues to sharpen and how best to clarify them.\" <i>Yarborough,</i> 540 U.S. at 5, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131143\"><a href=\"/opinion/131143/yarborough-v-gentry/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
