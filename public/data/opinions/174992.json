Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                      Boudin, Selya and Gajarsa,*\n\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Angelique Doble Bravo with whom José A. Gallart and Gallart\nLaw Firm were on brief for appellant.\n     Annette Cortés Arcelay with whom Eric Pérez-Ochoa and Adsuar\nMuñiz Goyco Seda & Pérez-Ochoa, P.S.C. were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                           September 8, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.       The question in this case is\n\nwhether a forum selection clause in a contract between the parties\n\nis displaced by Puerto Rico's Sales Representatives Act of 1990,\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, §§ 279-279h (2009) (\"Law 21\").                  The\n\ndistrict court held that it was not displaced and dismissed the\n\nsuit without prejudice.    Although there are disputed facts as to a\n\nsupposed breach of contract, the facts relating to the forum\n\nselection clause are not disputed, and that issue is dispositive on\n\nthis appeal.\n\n            Conbraco Industries, Inc. (\"Conbraco\"), based in North\n\nCarolina, manufactures valves and other industrial products.             On\n\nJanuary 1, 1999, Conbraco and Rafael Rodríguez Barril, Inc. (\"RRB\")\n\nexecuted a Sales Representative Agreement (\"the agreement\") in\n\nNorth    Carolina,   appointing   the    latter   as   a   Conbraco   sales\n\nrepresentative in Puerto Rico.     One provision required RRB and its\n\nstaff to \"refrain from any activities which may reflect adversely\n\nupon the reputation or credibility of Conbraco or the Products.\"\n\nConbraco terminated the contract on June 27, 2008, claiming a\n\nbreach of this provision by RRB several days earlier.1\n\n            On August 11, 2008, RRB sued Conbraco in Puerto Rico\n\nSuperior Court under Puerto Rico's Law 21.         Law 21 provides inter\n\n\n     1\n      In a nutshell, Conbraco alleged that at a Puerto Rico hotel\non June 23, 2008, RRB's president verbally attacked and threatened\nboth Conbraco's executive vice president and the owner of\nConbraco's largest distributor, and engaged in other improper\nactions.\n\n                                   -2-\n\falia that regardless of any contractual language to the contrary,\n\n(1)   sales      representation    contracts   covering   the    geographic\n\nterritory of Puerto Rico \"shall be construed pursuant to, and shall\n\nbe governed by\" Puerto Rico law, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, § 279f,\n\nand   (2)   no   principal   may   terminate   a   contract   with    a   sales\n\nrepresentative absent \"just cause,\" id. § 279a.           RRB alleged that\n\nConbraco terminated the contract without cause and requested a\n\ndeclaratory judgment, specific performance of the contract, and\n\ncompensation for Conbraco's allegedly tortious conduct.\n\n            However, the agreement contains a forum selection clause,\n\na choice of law clause, and a severability clause.                   The first\n\nprovides: \"In the event that either party brings suit to enforce\n\nthe terms of this [a]greement both [RRB] and Conbraco consent and\n\nagree that jurisdiction for such action will lie only in the state\n\nand federal courts sitting in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina\";\n\nthe second, that the contract \"shall be governed and construed in\n\nall respects\" according to North Carolina law; and the third, that\n\nif any provision is held unlawful or unenforceable, \"the remaining\n\nportions of the [a]greement shall remain in full force and effect.\"\n\n            After removing the action to federal court, Conbraco\n\nsought to enforce the forum selection clause by filing a motion to\n\ndismiss.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).      The magistrate judge, to whom\n\nthe matter was referred, recommended that the motion be granted,\n\nfinding the forum selection clause to be valid and stating that an\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fattack under Law 21 on the validity of the choice of law clause was\n\nproperly to be presented in the North Carolina forum specified in\n\nthe   forum    selection   clause.     The    district   court   adopted    the\n\nmagistrate      judge's    Report    and     Recommendation,     and   granted\n\nConbraco's motion to dismiss without prejudice.            RRB now appeals.\n\n              We review de novo a district court's Rule 12(b)(6)\n\ndismissal based on a forum selection clause.              Rivera v. Centro\n\nMédico de Turabo, Inc., 575 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 2009).                   This\n\nbeing a case based on diversity jurisdiction, the initial question\n\nis whether for Erie purposes, see Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304\n\nU.S. 64 (1938), we treat the issue of whether a forum selection\n\nclause is enforceable as \"procedural\" and look to a federal test of\n\nvalidity or instead treat it as \"substantive\" and look to pertinent\n\nstate law, starting with the choice of law rules that would be\n\nfollowed by the local court in the jurisdiction where the district\n\ncourt sits.\n\n              The Erie question has been reserved by the Supreme Court,\n\nStewart Org., Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 25-26, 32 & n.11\n\n(1988), and by this court, Rivera, 575 F.3d at 16-17, although most\n\ncircuits that have spoken favor a uniform federal standard to test\n\nthe validity of forum selection clauses, see Wong v. PartyGaming\n\nLtd., 589 F.3d 821, 827 (6th Cir. 2009) (collecting cases).                  It\n\nremains unnecessary for us to decide the issue here because both\n\nNorth Carolina,      Perkins v. CCH Computax, Inc., 423 S.E.2d 780,\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f783-84 (N.C. 1992),2 and Puerto Rico, Unisys P.R. v. Ramallo Bros.\n\nPrinting, Inc., 128 P.R. Dec. 842, 856-57 (1991), follow the\n\nfederal standard announced by the Supreme Court in The Bremen v.\n\nZapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1 (1972).\n\n            Under Bremen, an opening question is whether the forum\n\nspecified    in   the   selection   clause   is   mandatory   or   merely\n\npermissive, Rivera, 575 F.3d at 17, but that question is easily\n\nanswered because the clause before us states that jurisdiction\n\nwould lie \"only\" in North Carolina.       The next question is the scope\n\nof the clause; here, it operates when \"either party brings suit to\n\nenforce the terms of this [a]greement.\" This language embraces the\n\npresent suit insofar as RRB is suing for breach of contract and for\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief seeking specific performance of\n\nthe contract.\n\n            Admittedly, the contract by its terms permits termination\n\nwithout cause and without consequential or punitive damages, and\n\nRRB's theory is that, contrary to those terms, Law 21 prohibits\n\ntermination without cause and gives RRB a right to certain damages\n\nthat are specifically excluded by the contract.       But the effect of\n\nthe relief sought is to \"enforce\" the primary terms of the contract\n\n\n     2\n      Perkins was partly modified by a North Carolina statute, see\nSzymczyk v. Signs Now Corp., 606 S.E.2d 728, 732 n.2 (N.C. App.\n2005), but Perkins continues to apply to contracts, like ours, that\ndo not require disputes to be heard in a state other than North\nCarolina, see N.C. Gen. Stat. § 22B-3, and has remained otherwise\nvalid precedent, see Sec. Credit Leasing, Inc. v. D.J.'s of\nSalisbury, Inc., 537 S.E.2d 227, 232 (N.C. App. 2000).\n\n                                    -5-\n\fand to exclude only certain of its provisions.      Anyway, RRB does\n\nnot dispute that its suit falls within the terms of the forum\n\nselection clause.\n\n           Rather, RRB's position is that the clause, although\n\napplicable by its terms, is invalid.    This in turn brings us to the\n\nthird question under Bremen, which is whether there is some reason\n\nthe presumption of enforceability should not apply; \"the forum\n\nclause should control absent a strong showing that it should be set\n\naside,\"   Bremen, 407 U.S. at 15.   The Court has listed four grounds\n\nfor finding a forum selection clause unenforceable:\n\n           (1) the clause was the product of \"fraud or\n           overreaching,\" id. at 15;\n\n           (2) \"enforcement would be unreasonable and\n           unjust,\" id.;\n\n           (3) proceedings \"in the contractual forum will\n           be so gravely difficult and inconvenient that\n           [the party challenging the clause] will for\n           all practical purposes be deprived of his day\n           in court,\" id. at 18; or\n\n           (4) \"enforcement would contravene a strong\n           public policy of the forum in which suit is\n           brought, whether declared by statute or by\n           judicial decision,\" id. at 15.\n\nSee also Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,\n\n473 U.S. 614, 632 (1985) (discussing Bremen's factors).\n\n           Three of the factors are easily put aside. No fraudulent\n\ninducement   is   alleged.    Nor   would   enforcement   be   clearly\n\nunreasonable or unjust, as Conbraco is based in North Carolina, the\n\nagreement was executed in that state, and no suggestion is made\n\n                                -6-\n\fthat the clause was inserted in bad faith.                See Carnival Cruise\n\nLines,     Inc.   v.   Shute,   499   U.S.   585,   595   (1991)    (discussing\n\nfundamental fairness review). Nothing suggests that North Carolina\n\nis too burdensome a place for RRB to litigate or otherwise so\n\ninappropriate as to deprive RRB of an effective forum.\n\n             Here, we are concerned with only the fourth factor: RRB\n\nalleges that enforcing the agreement's forum selection clause and\n\ncompelling it to litigate in North Carolina would violate Puerto\n\nRico public policy as expressed in Law 21.                Law 21 protects an\n\n\"independent entrepreneur who establishes a sales representation\n\ncontract of an exclusive nature, with a principal or grantor, and\n\nwho   is   assigned    a   specific   territory     or    market,   within   the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"          P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, § 279(a).3\n\n             Law 21 does reflect what Bremen calls \"strong public\n\npolicy of the forum.\" Its provisions pertain to \"public order\" and\n\n\"shall be liberally construed,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, § 279g, and\n\nit is modeled on the Puerto Rico Dealers Act of 1964, P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 10, §§ 278-278e (\"Law 75\"), which provides similar\n\nprotections to distributors, Re-Ace, Inc. v. Wheeled Coach Indus.,\n\nInc., 363 F.3d 51, 57 (1st Cir. 2004), and has been held to embody\n\na \"strong public policy\" of Puerto Rico, A.M. Capen's Co., Inc. v.\n\n\n      3\n      Conbraco denies that RRB ever had such exclusive rights, but\non a motion to dismiss, we accept RRB's assertion that it had\neffective exclusivity before the agreement was disavowed by\nConbraco.   AVX Corp. v. Cabot Corp., 424 F.3d 28, 29 (1st Cir.\n2005).\n\n                                       -7-\n\fAm. Trading & Prod. Corp., 74 F.3d 317, 321 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(quoting Medina & Medina v. Country Pride Foods, Ltd, 858 F.2d 817,\n\n820 (1st Cir. 1988)).\n\n          However, Law 21 does not by its terms forbid a forum\n\nselection clause but only a choice of law clause insofar as the\n\nlatter would prevent Law 21's substantive protections from being\n\ngiven effect. See Triangle Trading Co. v. Robroy Indus., Inc., 952\n\nF. Supp. 75, 81 (D.P.R. 1997).    Specifically, Law 21 states:\n\n          The sales representation contracts referred to\n          in this chapter shall be construed pursuant\n          to, and shall be governed by the laws of the\n          Commonwealth   of   Puerto   Rico,   and   any\n          stipulation to the contrary shall be null.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, § 279f.    By contrast,   Law 75, upon which\n\nLaw 21 was modeled, Re-Ace, 363 F.3d at 57, includes both a\n\nprohibition on choice of law clauses and a prohibition on forum\n\nselection clauses.4\n\n          RRB argues that in this case the forum selection clause\n\nappears in the agreement under the heading \"Limitations on Damages\"\n\nand also includes a limitations on damages clause, a clause that\n\nRRB claims violates Law 21's damages provisions, P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 10, §§ 279c-279e.   But the agreement states that the headings\n\n\n\n     4\n      Law 75 provides: \"Any stipulation that obligates a dealer to\nadjust, arbitrate or litigate any controversy that comes up\nregarding his dealer's contract outside of Puerto Rico, or under\nforeign law or rule of law, shall be likewise considered as\nviolating the public policy set forth by this chapter and is\ntherefore null and void.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, § 278b-2.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fare \"for reference only and shall not be considered as substantive\n\nparts of this [a]greement,\" and the agreement also includes a\n\nseverability clause quoted above providing that if a provision is\n\nheld invalid, the rest of the agreement is preserved.\n\n          Alternatively, RRB argues that the forum selection clause\n\nis against Puerto Rico public policy because it chooses North\n\nCarolina as the designated forum, and--RRB claims--North Carolina\n\nlaw precludes North Carolina courts from assessing the merits of\n\nthe contract termination under the laws of another state.              This\n\nclaim is not supported: none of the North Carolina provisions or\n\nprecedents cited by RRB precludes a court in North Carolina from\n\nrespecting Law 21 to the extent that its terms would apply to the\n\npresent dispute.\n\n          RRB relies on language in North Carolina's statute on\n\ncontracts against public policy, which states that \"any provision\n\nin a contract entered into in North Carolina that requires the\n\nprosecution of any action . . . that arises from the contract to be\n\ninstituted or heard in another state is against public policy and\n\nis void and unenforceable.\"    N.C. Gen. Stat. § 22B-3.        But this is\n\na limitation on forum selection clauses that send North Carolina\n\ncontracts to other jurisdictions.        See Hickox v. R&G Group Int'l,\n\nInc., 588 S.E.2d 566, 568 (N.C. App. 2003).\n\n          RRB   also   discusses   N.C.    Gen.   Stat.   §   22B-2,   which\n\nprohibits choice of law and forum selection clauses in any contract\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f\"for the improvement of real property in [North Carolina], or\n\nproviding of materials therefor,\" and cites a judicial decision\n\ninterpreting the statute, Price & Price Mech. of N.C., Inc. v.\n\nMiken Corp., 661 S.E.2d 775 (N.C. App. 2008).           But this statute\n\nlikewise has nothing to do with the agreement, which does not\n\ninvolve real property.       Neither does a provision of the North\n\nCarolina    Sales   Representatives   Act   governing   waivers   of   that\n\nstatute, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 66-190 et seq., which RRB cites but does\n\nnot discuss.\n\n             Although the agreement contains a choice of law clause\n\nspecifying North Carolina law, \"North Carolina will not honor a\n\nchoice-of-law provision if the law of the chosen state is contrary\n\nto the fundamental policy of a state possessing a greater interest\n\nin the issue than the chosen state.\"           Volvo Trademark Holding\n\nAktiebolaget v. Clark Machinery Co., 510 F.3d 474, 479 (4th Cir.\n\n2007) (quoting Volvo Constr. Equip. N. Am., Inc. v. CLM Equip. Co.,\n\n386 F.3d 581, 607 (4th Cir. 2004)); see also Cable Tel Servs., Inc.\n\nv. Overland Contracting, Inc., 574          S.E.2d 31, 33-34 (N.C. App.\n\n2002).     Thus, nothing prevents a court sitting in North Carolina\n\nfrom honoring Law 21 to the extent it would otherwise apply.\n\n            The possibility remains that a North Carolina state court\n\nmight decide not to respect Puerto Rico's asserted interest in\n\nregulating the relationship of the parties in accord with Law 21.\n\nIf so, a federal district court in North Carolina would arguably be\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fbound under Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co. Inc., 313 U.S.\n\n487, 496 (1941), to reach the same result.       But RRB makes no\n\nargument to show that this outcome is likely.   It merely says that\n\nthe agreement requires North Carolina substantive law to apply, and\n\nthis, as we have shown, is not necessarily the law that a North\n\nCarolina court would find applicable.\n\n          Finally, RRB asserts that the district court found that\n\nthe agreement's choice of law provision would be respected by the\n\nNorth Carolina courts.     An ambiguous sentence in the court's\n\ndecision could be so read.    But no such ruling was made by the\n\nmagistrate judge whose recommendation was adopted by the district\n\ncourt, nor was it necessary to the district court's result.      We\n\nread the district court's holding as limited to the validity of the\n\nforum selection clause and affirm solely on that issue.\n\n          In sum, substantive issues as to choice of law, as well\n\nas the merits of the contract termination controversy, are to be\n\nresolved in the forum chosen by the parties.    The forum selection\n\nclause in the agreement fixes North Carolina as the forum, and the\n\nforum selection clause is not forbidden by Law 21.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

Although there are disputed facts as to a\n\nsupposed breach of contract, the facts relating to the forum\n\nselection clause are not disputed, and that issue is dispositive on\n\nthis appeal.\n\n            Conbraco Industries, Inc.

One provision required RRB and its\n\nstaff to \"refrain from any activities which may reflect adversely\n\nupon the reputation or credibility of Conbraco or the Products.\"\n\nConbraco terminated the contract on June 27, 2008, claiming a\n\nbreach of this provision by RRB several days earlier.1\n\n            On August 11, 2008, RRB sued Conbraco in Puerto Rico\n\nSuperior Court under Puerto Rico's Law 21.

RRB alleged that\n\nConbraco terminated the contract without cause and requested a\n\ndeclaratory judgment, specific performance of the contract, and\n\ncompensation for Conbraco's allegedly tortious conduct.\n\n            However, the agreement contains a forum selection clause,\n\na choice of law clause, and a severability clause.                   The first\n\nprovides: \"In the event that either party brings suit to enforce\n\nthe terms of this [a]greement both [RRB] and Conbraco consent and\n\nagree that jurisdiction for such action will lie only in the state\n\nand federal courts sitting in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina\";\n\nthe second, that the contract \"shall be governed and construed in\n\nall respects\" according to North Carolina law; and the third, that\n\nif any provision is held unlawful or unenforceable, \"the remaining\n\nportions of the [a]greement shall remain in full force and effect.\"\n\n            After removing the action to federal court, Conbraco\n\nsought to enforce the forum selection clause by filing a motion to\n\ndismiss.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).      The magistrate judge, to whom\n\nthe matter was referred, recommended that the motion be granted,\n\nfinding the forum selection clause to be valid and stating that an\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fattack under Law 21 on the validity of the choice of law clause was\n\nproperly to be presented in the North Carolina forum specified in\n\nthe   forum    selection   clause.     The    district   court   adopted    the\n\nmagistrate      judge's    Report    and     Recommendation,     and   granted\n\nConbraco's motion to dismiss without prejudice.

The next question is the scope\n\nof the clause; here, it operates when \"either party brings suit to\n\nenforce the terms of this [a]greement.\" This language embraces the\n\npresent suit insofar as RRB is suing for breach of contract and for\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief seeking specific performance of\n\nthe contract.\n\n            Admittedly, the contract by its terms permits termination\n\nwithout cause and without consequential or punitive damages, and\n\nRRB's theory is that, contrary to those terms, Law 21 prohibits\n\ntermination without cause and gives RRB a right to certain damages\n\nthat are specifically excluded by the contract.

Anyway, RRB does\n\nnot dispute that its suit falls within the terms of the forum\n\nselection clause.\n\n           Rather, RRB's position is that the clause, although\n\napplicable by its terms, is invalid.    This in turn brings us to the\n\nthird question under Bremen, which is whether there is some reason\n\nthe presumption of enforceability should not apply; \"the forum\n\nclause should control absent a strong showing that it should be set\n\naside,\"   Bremen, 407 U.S. at 15.   The Court has listed four grounds\n\nfor finding a forum selection clause unenforceable:\n\n           (1) the clause was the product of \"fraud or\n           overreaching,\" id. at 15;\n\n           (2) \"enforcement would be unreasonable and\n           unjust,\" id.;\n\n           (3) proceedings \"in the contractual forum will\n           be so gravely difficult and inconvenient that\n           [the party challenging the clause] will for\n           all practical purposes be deprived of his day\n           in court,\" id. at 18; or\n\n           (4) \"enforcement would contravene a strong\n           public policy of the forum in which suit is\n           brought, whether declared by statute or by\n           judicial decision,\" id. at 15.\n\nSee also Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v.

Specifically, Law 21 states:\n\n          The sales representation contracts referred to\n          in this chapter shall be construed pursuant\n          to, and shall be governed by the laws of the\n          Commonwealth   of   Puerto   Rico,   and   any\n          stipulation to the contrary shall be null.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, § 279f.    By contrast,   Law 75, upon which\n\nLaw 21 was modeled, Re-Ace, 363 F.3d at 57, includes both a\n\nprohibition on choice of law clauses and a prohibition on forum\n\nselection clauses.4\n\n          RRB argues that in this case the forum selection clause\n\nappears in the agreement under the heading \"Limitations on Damages\"\n\nand also includes a limitations on damages clause, a clause that\n\nRRB claims violates Law 21's damages provisions, P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 10, §§ 279c-279e.   But the agreement states that the headings\n\n\n\n     4\n      Law 75 provides: \"Any stipulation that obligates a dealer to\nadjust, arbitrate or litigate any controversy that comes up\nregarding his dealer's contract outside of Puerto Rico, or under\nforeign law or rule of law, shall be likewise considered as\nviolating the public policy set forth by this chapter and is\ntherefore null and void.\" P.R.

This\n\nclaim is not supported: none of the North Carolina provisions or\n\nprecedents cited by RRB precludes a court in North Carolina from\n\nrespecting Law 21 to the extent that its terms would apply to the\n\npresent dispute.\n\n          RRB relies on language in North Carolina's statute on\n\ncontracts against public policy, which states that \"any provision\n\nin a contract entered into in North Carolina that requires the\n\nprosecution of any action . . . that arises from the contract to be\n\ninstituted or heard in another state is against public policy and\n\nis void and unenforceable.\"    N.C.

An ambiguous sentence in the court's\n\ndecision could be so read.    But no such ruling was made by the\n\nmagistrate judge whose recommendation was adopted by the district\n\ncourt, nor was it necessary to the district court's result.
