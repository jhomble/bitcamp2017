Maine Savings Bank\n                                        \n\nbrought this action against  appellants, Harvey E. Prawer and\n\nGilbert  Prawer,  to  collect  money owed  to  it  under  two\n\npromissory  notes the  appellants had  personally guaranteed.\n\nThe bank alleged that Limehouse Corporation (\"Limehouse\"), of\n\nwhich Harvey Prawer was the president, defaulted on the notes\n\nwhen   it  stopped   making   monthly   interest   payments.1\n\nAppellants argued  below, as  the basis of  their affirmative\n\ndefenses  and  their  counterclaims  against  the bank,  that\n\nLimehouse  stopped  making  payments  because  the  bank  had\n\nreneged  on an agreement  to provide even  more financing for\n\ntheir real estate project.   The United States District Court\n\nfor the District  of Maine granted  summary judgment for  the\n\nbank's successors in interest,  appellees Fleet Bank of Maine\n\nand the FDIC, and we affirm. \n\n                              I.\n\n          The district court found  the following facts to be\n\nundisputed.  In 1987 appellants Harvey and Gilbert Prawer, on\n\nbehalf of  Limehouse, of  which Harvey Prawer  was president,\n\nbegan negotiations  with Maine Savings Bank  (\"the Bank\") for\n\nthe financing of the purchase and development of 122 acres of\n\n                    \n\n1.   Limehouse  Corporation is  not a  party to  this action.\nThe bank sued  only Harvey  E. Prawer and  Gilbert Prawer  in\ntheir  individual capacities, as guarantors of one promissory\nnote and co-makers of the other.\n\nland in Scarborough, Maine.   Appellants planned to subdivide\n\nthe property and market it as a planned residential community\n\nknown as \"Coulthard Farms.\"  At the time of the negotiations,\n\nthe total cost of the project was estimated to be $2,500,000,\n\nconsisting of $1,000,000 for the  purchase of the real estate\n\nand $1,500,000 for the  construction of the infrastructure   \n\nroads, sewers,  water supply  and other structures  needed to\n\ntransform the land into a residential community.\n\n          On October  1, 1987,  the Bank issued  a commitment\n\nletter (\"First  Commitment Letter\"),  in which it  offered to\n\nlend $1,000,000  to Limehouse  for purchase of  the Coulthard\n\nFarms  property,  for  a  term   of  \"36  months,  on  demand\n\nthereafter,\" at  an adjustable  rate, initially 10.50%.   The\n\nLetter  specified  that interest  payments  were  to be  made\n\nmonthly.   By  signing  the Letter,  Harvey Prawer  agreed on\n\nbehalf  of Limehouse to borrow  the money \"in accordance with\n\nthe  []  terms  and  conditions\"  of  the  Letter,  including\n\ngranting  the Bank a mortgage on the property.  One paragraph\n\nof the four-page letter  of terms and conditions  said, \"This\n\nloan  shall be repaid from the sale of the mortgaged property\n\nor its refinancing into a residential subdivision development\n\nloan.\"\n\n          On October 15, 1987, Harvey Prawer, as president of\n\nLimehouse, executed  a promissory note (\"First  Note\") in the\n\namount  of $1,000,000 to the  Bank.  Both  Harvey and Gilbert\n\n                             -3-\n\nPrawer, acting in  their individual  capacities, executed  an\n\nunconditional guaranty  of the  First Note.   The First  Note\n\nobligated Limehouse to make  monthly payments of the interest\n\ndue and to repay the principal sum on demand after October 1,\n\n1990.2   A default  provision defined \"default\"  as including\n\nfailure to  pay  any  installment  of the  interest  due  and\n\nauthorized the holder of  the Note, in addition to  the right\n\nto  demand payment after October 1, 1990, to declare the Note\n\nimmediately  due  and  payable in  full  in  the  event of  a\n\ndefault.3     The  provisions   of  the  First   Note,  while\n\n                    \n\n2.   The First Note provided, in part:\n\n               For Value Received, On  Demand after\n          October 1, 1990, the undersigned promises\n          to pay  to  the order  of  Maine  Savings\n          Bank,  a  Maine banking  corporation, the\n          sum     of     One    Million     Dollars\n          ($1,000,000.00),  or  so much  thereof as\n          may be advanced,  together with  interest\n          upon the principal sum thereof  from time\n          to time advanced, . . . ;  which interest\n          at  said rates shall  be paid  monthly in\n          arrears   on  the   first  day   of  each\n          succeeding month hereafter, with  a final\n          payment of interest when the indebtedness\n          evidenced hereby is paid in full.\n\n3.   The default provision of the First Note provided:\n\n               In case of default in the payment of\n          any installment of  interest due  hereon,\n          including  default in the  payment of any\n          applicable late charge, and  such default\n          is  continued  for a  period  of  one (1)\n          month, or in case  of default in any term\n          or condition of  a Mortgage and  Security\n          Agreement of even date, given as security\n          herefor, the holder hereof at  its option\n          may declare  due and payable at  once the\n\n                             -4-\n\nconsiderably more detailed,  were consistent  with the  terms\n\noutlined  in  the  First  Commitment  Letter;  but  the  Note\n\ncontained  no reference  to repayment  from the  sale of  the\n\nmortgaged property or its refinancing.\n\n          On the  same date,  the Bank and  Limehouse entered\n\ninto a  Mortgage and Security Agreement  whereby the property\n\nto be purchased  by Limehouse for the Coulthard Farms project\n\nwas mortgaged to  the Bank.   One provision  of the  Mortgage\n\nstated  that, \"Upon request  of Grantor  [Limehouse], Grantee\n\n[the  Bank] may, at its  sole option, from  time to time make\n\nfurther  advances  to Grantor,  provided,  however, that  the\n\ntotal   principal  secured   hereby  and   remaining  unpaid,\n\nincluding  any such advances shall not at any time exceed the\n\nsum   of   Two   Million  Five   Hundred   Thousand   Dollars\n\n($2,500,000.00).\"\n\n          On  September 7, 1988, the  Bank issued a letter of\n\nintent to  the Maine Department  of Environmental Protection,\n\nvouching   for  the  financial  condition  of  Limehouse  and\n\nappellants and stating that the Bank  intended to finance the\n\ndevelopment of the Coulthard Farms project.\n\n          On  December  21,  1988, the  Bank  issued  another\n\ncommitment  letter (\"Second Commitment Letter\") to Limehouse,\n\n                    \n\n          unpaid principal  balance hereof, accrued\n          interest and late charges, as applicable.\n          The foregoing rights shall be in addition\n          to the demand right of the holder  hereof\n          after October 1, 1990.\n\n                             -5-\n\noffering to lend  an additional  $200,000 for a  term of  \"12\n\nmonths with interest  only to be repaid from  the refinancing\n\nof the debt into a residential subdivision development loan.\"\n\nAppellants accepted  the terms  and conditions of  the Second\n\nCommitment  Letter   by  signing   it  in  their   individual\n\ncapacities.\n\n          On  April 12,  1989,  Harvey  Prawer, as  Limehouse\n\npresident, executed a promissory  note (\"Second Note\") in the\n\namount of $200,000 \"or so much thereof as may be advanced\" to\n\nthe  Bank.    Both  Harvey  and   Gilbert,  acting  in  their\n\nindividual capacities, executed the Second Note as co-makers.\n\nOnly $100,000 in funds was advanced by the Bank to Limehouse.\n\nThe  Second Note  contained provisions  for monthly  interest\n\npayments and default substantially  identical to those of the\n\nFirst Note.   Like the  First Note, the  Second Note's  terms\n\nwere consistent with those  outlined in the Second Commitment\n\nLetter, except there was no mention of  repaying the interest\n\nfrom the refinancing of the debt.\n\n          Sometime  in  1990  Limehouse  stopped  making  the\n\nmonthly  interest payments  due  under the  First and  Second\n\nNotes.  The Bank  notified Limehouse that it was  in default,\n\nbut Limehouse did not cure the  default.  On August 30, 1990,\n\nthe  Bank filed  an action  in Maine  Superior Court  against\n\nHarvey Prawer and Gilbert Prawer, as guarantors of  the First\n\nNote and co-makers of the Second Note, seeking payment of the\n\n                             -6-\n\nprincipal  and  unpaid interest  on both  Notes.   (Under the\n\nFirst Note  the Bank  alleged it  was owed, as  of August  9,\n\n1990,  $1,000,000  in  principal  and  approximately  $32,900\n\ninterest; under  the  Second  Note,  $100,000  in  principal,\n\n$3,100  in interest.)   On  September 26,  1990, the  Prawers\n\nanswered the complaint, raised affirmative defenses, and made\n\ncounterclaims against the Bank.  \n\n          Subsequently,  Maine  Savings  Bank  failed.    The\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (\"FDIC\"), the receiver\n\nof Maine  Savings Bank,  was substituted as  the counterclaim\n\ndefendant, and  Fleet Bank of Maine  (\"Fleet\"), the purchaser\n\nof  the Bank's assets, was substituted as the plaintiff.  The\n\ncase  was removed by the  FDIC to the  United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Maine.\n\n          In September 1991,  plaintiff Fleet filed a  motion\n\nfor summary judgment.   Counterclaim defendant FDIC filed its\n\nmotion for summary judgment in  February 1992.  The  district\n\ncourt granted both motions on April 3, 1992, finding that the\n\nPrawers' affirmative defenses and counterclaims turned on the\n\nsame question:  whether the two Commitment  Letters issued by\n\nthe Bank conditioned  repayment of the Notes  upon the Bank's\n\nultimate refinancing of  the debt.   The district court  held\n\nthat the  D'Oench, Duhme doctrine prevented  the Prawers from\n                        \n\nusing the Commitment Letters to defend against the efforts by\n\nFleet and  the FDIC  to collect  on the facially  unqualified\n\n                             -7-\n\nNotes.   See  D'Oench,  Duhme &amp;  Co.  v. FDIC,  315 U.S.  447\n                                             \n\n(1942).  The Prawers appeal from the district court's order.4\n\n                             II.\n\n          We review  the district  court's  grant of  summary\n\njudgment de novo,  looking at  the record in  the light  most\n                \n\nfavorable to appellants.   August v. Offices Unlimited, Inc.,\n                                                            \n\n981 F.2d 576, 580 (1st Cir. 1992).  The district court  based\n\nsummary judgment on the D'Oench, Duhme doctrine, but \"we need\n                                      \n\nnot  limit  ourselves  to  the  exact  grounds  for  decision\n\nutilized below.  We are free, on appeal, to affirm a judgment\n\non  any independently  sufficient  ground.\"   Aunyx Corp.  v.\n                                                         \n\nCanon  U.S.A., Inc., 978 F.2d  3, 6 (1st  Cir. 1992) (quoting\n                                                             \n\nPolyplastics, Inc. v.

We do not reach D'Oench,  Duhme here\n                                                        \n\nbecause  we  find that  appellees  were  entitled to  summary\n\njudgment as a matter of Maine contract law.5\n\n          Appellants admit that  Limehouse stopped making the\n\nmonthly  interest payments  due  under the  First and  Second\n\nNotes,  but  contend  that  its obligation  to  make  monthly\n\n                    \n\n4.   The  district court  had jurisdiction  over this  matter\npursuant to 12 U.S.C.    1819(b)(2)(A) and 28 U.S.C.    1331.\nThis court has jurisdiction  over this appeal pursuant to  28\nU.S.C.   1291.\n\n5.   The  parties   agree  that   Maine  law   governs  their\nrespective rights and obligations, outside of the question of\napplication of the federal D'Oench, Duhme doctrine.\n                                         \n\n                             -8-\n\ninterest payments and  repay the principal  of the First  and\n\nSecond  Notes was conditioned upon  a promise by  the Bank to\n\nprovide financing for the development.  While no such promise\n\nis to be found  in the provisions of either  Note, appellants\n\npoint  to  the  Commitment  Letters as  establishing  such  a\n\npromise.   Because the  First Commitment Letter  stated that,\n\n\"This loan shall  be repaid  from the sale  of the  mortgaged\n\nproperty or its  refinancing into  a residential  subdivision\n\ndevelopment   loan,\"  appellants   say  that   the  repayment\n\nobligations under the First  Note were wholly contingent upon\n\nthe  Bank's providing  new financing  for development  of the\n\nproperty.   Because the Second  Note described the  loan term\n\nas,  \"12  months with  interest only  to  be repaid  from the\n\nrefinancing  of  the  debt  into  a  residential  subdivision\n\ndevelopment  loan,\"  appellants   contend  that   Limehouse's\n\nobligations  under the Second  Note were  likewise contingent\n\nupon the Bank's providing of refinancing.  Appellants further\n\ninsist  that interpretation  of the  Notes is  insulated from\n\nsummary judgment disposition as it is a mixed question of law\n\nand fact.\n\n          A major problem with  appellants' approach is that,\n\nunder Maine contract law, a court does not consider extrinsic\n\nevidence in  interpreting a  contract unless the  language of\n\nthe contract is ambiguous.  Portland Valve, Inc.  v. Rockwood\n                                                             \n\nSystems Corp., 460 A.2d 1383, 1387 (Me. 1983).  \n             \n\n                             -9-\n\n               The   issue   of  whether   contract\n          language  is ambiguous  is a  question of\n          law for the Court.  The interpretation of\n          an  unambiguous  written  contract  is  a\n          question  of  law   for  the  Court;  the\n          interpretation of ambiguous language is a\n          question   for   the  factfinder.     The\n          interpretation of  an unambiguous writing\n          must be determined from the plain meaning\n          of  the language used  and from  the four\n          corners of the instrument  without resort\n          to extrinsic evidence.  Once an ambiguity\n          is found then  extrinsic evidence may  be\n          admitted  and  considered  to   show  the\n          intention  of  the  parties.     Contract\n          language   is   ambiguous   when  it   is\n          reasonably   susceptible   of   different\n          interpretations.\n\nId.  (citations omitted);  see  also  Triple-A Baseball  Club\n                                                             \n\nAssoc. v.  Northeastern Baseball, Inc., 832  F.2d 214, 220-21\n                                      \n\n(1st  Cir.   1987)   (summarizing  Maine   law  of   contract\n\ninterpretation), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 935 (1988).  Here the\n                             \n\ncontract terms     the  repayment terms contained  within the\n\nfour corners of the Notes    are not at all ambiguous.  In no\n\nrelevant way  are they  \"reasonably susceptible  of different\n\ninterpretations.\"   Portland  Valve, 460 A.2d  at 1387.   The\n                                   \n\nrepayment terms are clear and unconditional: the maker of the\n\nNote is obligated to  make monthly interest payments; failure\n\nto  make  interest payments  constitutes  a  default; if  the\n\ngrantor defaults,  the grantee  may demand full  repayment of\n\nthe principal sum and accrued interest.   There is no hint in\n\nthe Notes' language that  the Bank's extension of refinancing\n\nis a condition to  full repayment upon default.   Because the\n\nNotes  are  unambiguous,  appellants  may  not  rely  on  the\n\n                             -10-\n\nCommitment  Letters  to  show that  the  terms  of the  Notes\n\ndiffered from their plain meaning.  Id. \n                                       \n\n          Appellants argue  that the Commitment  Letters were\n\nincorporated  into the  Notes  and thus  the Letters'  terms,\n\nincluding the Letters' references  to refinancing, should  be\n\nconsidered as part and parcel of the parties' agreement.  The\n\nLetters  were entirely  incorporated  into the  Notes, it  is\n\ncontended, because  the Notes \"referred to\"  the Mortgage and\n\nthe Mortgage \"referred to\" the First Commitment Letter.  This\n\noverlooks the  limited nature of the  cross-references.  None\n\nof  the  documents in  question,  nor  anything  else in  the\n\nrecord,  suggests that  the parties  intended  to incorporate\n\neverything said  in the  Commitment Letters as  conditions of\n\nthe Notes.   The Notes  provided that Limehouse  would be  in\n                                               \n\ndefault  of the Note if it defaulted on its obligations under\n                                           \n\nthe  Mortgage  and  Security  Agreement.   The  Mortgage  and\n\nSecurity   Agreement  stated  that   Limehouse  must  perform\n                                              \n\nwhatever obligations  it had  under the  terms  of the  First\n                        \n\nCommitment Letter.  Neither of these references says anything\n\nabout  the  requirement  of monthly  interest  payments,  the\n\nprovision  of  the  Note  as to  which  Limehouse  defaulted.\n\nNothing is anywhere  said that a failure by the  Bank to meet\n\nits  purported  refinancing  assurances  in   the  Commitment\n\nLetters will  constitute a defense to  the borrower's default\n\nupon the Notes.  \n\n                             -11-\n\n          The  Notes  are   at  least  partially   integrated\n\nagreements for  purposes of  the parol evidence  rule.

In support of this contention, appellants assert\n\nthat the Bank  \"knew\" and the  parties \"understood\" that  the\n\nBank  would make  a development  loan in  the future.   \"Mere\n\nallegations,  or conjecture  unsupported in  the record,  are\n\ninsufficient  to raise  a  genuine issue  of material  fact.\"\n\nAugust, 981 F.2d  at 580.

Nothing is offered by appellants to show the loan\n\namount, interest  rate, period of repayment, repayment terms,\n\nconditions, or other material  terms of the alleged agreement\n\nfor this financing.   Mere declarations of intention to enter\n\ninto  a future  agreement     which  is,  at most,  what  the\n\nstatements in the Commitment Letters and in the letter to the\n\nMaine Department  of Environmental  Protection are     do not\n\ncreate a binding contract.

Maine Savings Bank\n                                        \n\nbrought this action against  appellants, Harvey E. Prawer and\n\nGilbert  Prawer,  to  collect  money owed  to  it  under  two\n\npromissory  notes the  appellants had  personally guaranteed.\n\nThe bank alleged that Limehouse Corporation (\"Limehouse\"), of\n\nwhich Harvey Prawer was the president, defaulted on the notes\n\nwhen   it  stopped   making   monthly   interest   payments.1\n\nAppellants argued  below, as  the basis of  their affirmative\n\ndefenses  and  their  counterclaims  against  the bank,  that\n\nLimehouse  stopped  making  payments  because  the  bank  had\n\nreneged  on an agreement  to provide even  more financing for\n\ntheir real estate project.   The United States District Court\n\nfor the District  of Maine granted  summary judgment for  the\n\nbank's successors in interest,  appellees Fleet Bank of Maine\n\nand the FDIC, and we affirm. \n\n                              I.\n\n          The district court found  the following facts to be\n\nundisputed.  In 1987 appellants Harvey and Gilbert Prawer, on\n\nbehalf of  Limehouse, of  which Harvey Prawer  was president,\n\nbegan negotiations  with Maine Savings Bank  (\"the Bank\") for\n\nthe financing of the purchase and development of 122 acres of\n\n                    \n\n1.   Limehouse  Corporation is  not a  party to  this action.\nThe bank sued  only Harvey  E. Prawer and  Gilbert Prawer  in\ntheir  individual capacities, as guarantors of one promissory\nnote and co-makers of the other.\n\nland in Scarborough, Maine.   Appellants planned to subdivide\n\nthe property and market it as a planned residential community\n\nknown as \"Coulthard Farms.\"  At the time of the negotiations,\n\nthe total cost of the project was estimated to be $2,500,000,\n\nconsisting of $1,000,000 for the  purchase of the real estate\n\nand $1,500,000 for the  construction of the infrastructure   \n\nroads, sewers,  water supply  and other structures  needed to\n\ntransform the land into a residential community.\n\n          On October  1, 1987,  the Bank issued  a commitment\n\nletter (\"First  Commitment Letter\"),  in which it  offered to\n\nlend $1,000,000  to Limehouse  for purchase of  the Coulthard\n\nFarms  property,  for  a  term   of  \"36  months,  on  demand\n\nthereafter,\" at  an adjustable  rate, initially 10.50%.   The\n\nLetter  specified  that interest  payments  were  to be  made\n\nmonthly.   By  signing  the Letter,  Harvey Prawer  agreed on\n\nbehalf  of Limehouse to borrow  the money \"in accordance with\n\nthe  []  terms  and  conditions\"  of  the  Letter,  including\n\ngranting  the Bank a mortgage on the property.  One paragraph\n\nof the four-page letter  of terms and conditions  said, \"This\n\nloan  shall be repaid from the sale of the mortgaged property\n\nor its refinancing into a residential subdivision development\n\nloan.\"\n\n          On October 15, 1987, Harvey Prawer, as president of\n\nLimehouse, executed  a promissory note (\"First  Note\") in the\n\namount  of $1,000,000 to the  Bank.  Both  Harvey and Gilbert\n\n                             -3-\n\nPrawer, acting in  their individual  capacities, executed  an\n\nunconditional guaranty  of the  First Note.   The First  Note\n\nobligated Limehouse to make  monthly payments of the interest\n\ndue and to repay the principal sum on demand after October 1,\n\n1990.2   A default  provision defined \"default\"  as including\n\nfailure to  pay  any  installment  of the  interest  due  and\n\nauthorized the holder of  the Note, in addition to  the right\n\nto  demand payment after October 1, 1990, to declare the Note\n\nimmediately  due  and  payable in  full  in  the  event of  a\n\ndefault.3     The  provisions   of  the  First   Note,  while\n\n                    \n\n2.   The First Note provided, in part:\n\n               For Value Received, On  Demand after\n          October 1, 1990, the undersigned promises\n          to pay  to  the order  of  Maine  Savings\n          Bank,  a  Maine banking  corporation, the\n          sum     of     One    Million     Dollars\n          ($1,000,000.00),  or  so much  thereof as\n          may be advanced,  together with  interest\n          upon the principal sum thereof  from time\n          to time advanced, . . . ;  which interest\n          at  said rates shall  be paid  monthly in\n          arrears   on  the   first  day   of  each\n          succeeding month hereafter, with  a final\n          payment of interest when the indebtedness\n          evidenced hereby is paid in full.\n\n3.   The default provision of the First Note provided:\n\n               In case of default in the payment of\n          any installment of  interest due  hereon,\n          including  default in the  payment of any\n          applicable late charge, and  such default\n          is  continued  for a  period  of  one (1)\n          month, or in case  of default in any term\n          or condition of  a Mortgage and  Security\n          Agreement of even date, given as security\n          herefor, the holder hereof at  its option\n          may declare  due and payable at  once the\n\n                             -4-\n\nconsiderably more detailed,  were consistent  with the  terms\n\noutlined  in  the  First  Commitment  Letter;  but  the  Note\n\ncontained  no reference  to repayment  from the  sale of  the\n\nmortgaged property or its refinancing.\n\n          On the  same date,  the Bank and  Limehouse entered\n\ninto a  Mortgage and Security Agreement  whereby the property\n\nto be purchased  by Limehouse for the Coulthard Farms project\n\nwas mortgaged to  the Bank.   One provision  of the  Mortgage\n\nstated  that, \"Upon request  of Grantor  [Limehouse], Grantee\n\n[the  Bank] may, at its  sole option, from  time to time make\n\nfurther  advances  to Grantor,  provided,  however, that  the\n\ntotal   principal  secured   hereby  and   remaining  unpaid,\n\nincluding  any such advances shall not at any time exceed the\n\nsum   of   Two   Million  Five   Hundred   Thousand   Dollars\n\n($2,500,000.00).\"\n\n          On  September 7, 1988, the  Bank issued a letter of\n\nintent to  the Maine Department  of Environmental Protection,\n\nvouching   for  the  financial  condition  of  Limehouse  and\n\nappellants and stating that the Bank  intended to finance the\n\ndevelopment of the Coulthard Farms project.\n\n          On  December  21,  1988, the  Bank  issued  another\n\ncommitment  letter (\"Second Commitment Letter\") to Limehouse,\n\n                    \n\n          unpaid principal  balance hereof, accrued\n          interest and late charges, as applicable.\n          The foregoing rights shall be in addition\n          to the demand right of the holder  hereof\n          after October 1, 1990.\n\n                             -5-\n\noffering to lend  an additional  $200,000 for a  term of  \"12\n\nmonths with interest  only to be repaid from  the refinancing\n\nof the debt into a residential subdivision development loan.\"\n\nAppellants accepted  the terms  and conditions of  the Second\n\nCommitment  Letter   by  signing   it  in  their   individual\n\ncapacities.\n\n          On  April 12,  1989,  Harvey  Prawer, as  Limehouse\n\npresident, executed a promissory  note (\"Second Note\") in the\n\namount of $200,000 \"or so much thereof as may be advanced\" to\n\nthe  Bank.    Both  Harvey  and   Gilbert,  acting  in  their\n\nindividual capacities, executed the Second Note as co-makers.\n\nOnly $100,000 in funds was advanced by the Bank to Limehouse.\n\nThe  Second Note  contained provisions  for monthly  interest\n\npayments and default substantially  identical to those of the\n\nFirst Note.   Like the  First Note, the  Second Note's  terms\n\nwere consistent with those  outlined in the Second Commitment\n\nLetter, except there was no mention of  repaying the interest\n\nfrom the refinancing of the debt.\n\n          Sometime  in  1990  Limehouse  stopped  making  the\n\nmonthly  interest payments  due  under the  First and  Second\n\nNotes.  The Bank  notified Limehouse that it was  in default,\n\nbut Limehouse did not cure the  default.  On August 30, 1990,\n\nthe  Bank filed  an action  in Maine  Superior Court  against\n\nHarvey Prawer and Gilbert Prawer, as guarantors of  the First\n\nNote and co-makers of the Second Note, seeking payment of the\n\n                             -6-\n\nprincipal  and  unpaid interest  on both  Notes.   (Under the\n\nFirst Note  the Bank  alleged it  was owed, as  of August  9,\n\n1990,  $1,000,000  in  principal  and  approximately  $32,900\n\ninterest; under  the  Second  Note,  $100,000  in  principal,\n\n$3,100  in interest.)   On  September 26,  1990, the  Prawers\n\nanswered the complaint, raised affirmative defenses, and made\n\ncounterclaims against the Bank.  \n\n          Subsequently,  Maine  Savings  Bank  failed.    The\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (\"FDIC\"), the receiver\n\nof Maine  Savings Bank,  was substituted as  the counterclaim\n\ndefendant, and  Fleet Bank of Maine  (\"Fleet\"), the purchaser\n\nof  the Bank's assets, was substituted as the plaintiff.  The\n\ncase  was removed by the  FDIC to the  United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Maine.\n\n          In September 1991,  plaintiff Fleet filed a  motion\n\nfor summary judgment.   Counterclaim defendant FDIC filed its\n\nmotion for summary judgment in  February 1992.  The  district\n\ncourt granted both motions on April 3, 1992, finding that the\n\nPrawers' affirmative defenses and counterclaims turned on the\n\nsame question:  whether the two Commitment  Letters issued by\n\nthe Bank conditioned  repayment of the Notes  upon the Bank's\n\nultimate refinancing of  the debt.

The  district court  had jurisdiction  over this  matter\npursuant to 12 U.S.C.    1819(b)(2)(A) and 28 U.S.C.    1331.\nThis court has jurisdiction  over this appeal pursuant to  28\nU.S.C.   1291.\n\n5.   The  parties   agree  that   Maine  law   governs  their\nrespective rights and obligations, outside of the question of\napplication of the federal D'Oench, Duhme doctrine.\n                                         \n\n                             -8-\n\ninterest payments and  repay the principal  of the First  and\n\nSecond  Notes was conditioned upon  a promise by  the Bank to\n\nprovide financing for the development.  While no such promise\n\nis to be found  in the provisions of either  Note, appellants\n\npoint  to  the  Commitment  Letters as  establishing  such  a\n\npromise.   Because the  First Commitment Letter  stated that,\n\n\"This loan shall  be repaid  from the sale  of the  mortgaged\n\nproperty or its  refinancing into  a residential  subdivision\n\ndevelopment   loan,\"  appellants   say  that   the  repayment\n\nobligations under the First  Note were wholly contingent upon\n\nthe  Bank's providing  new financing  for development  of the\n\nproperty.   Because the Second  Note described the  loan term\n\nas,  \"12  months with  interest only  to  be repaid  from the\n\nrefinancing  of  the  debt  into  a  residential  subdivision\n\ndevelopment  loan,\"  appellants   contend  that   Limehouse's\n\nobligations  under the Second  Note were  likewise contingent\n\nupon the Bank's providing of refinancing.  Appellants further\n\ninsist  that interpretation  of the  Notes is  insulated from\n\nsummary judgment disposition as it is a mixed question of law\n\nand fact.\n\n          A major problem with  appellants' approach is that,\n\nunder Maine contract law, a court does not consider extrinsic\n\nevidence in  interpreting a  contract unless the  language of\n\nthe contract is ambiguous.

The interpretation of\n          an  unambiguous  written  contract  is  a\n          question  of  law   for  the  Court;  the\n          interpretation of ambiguous language is a\n          question   for   the  factfinder.     The\n          interpretation of  an unambiguous writing\n          must be determined from the plain meaning\n          of  the language used  and from  the four\n          corners of the instrument  without resort\n          to extrinsic evidence.

The\n                                   \n\nrepayment terms are clear and unconditional: the maker of the\n\nNote is obligated to  make monthly interest payments; failure\n\nto  make  interest payments  constitutes  a  default; if  the\n\ngrantor defaults,  the grantee  may demand full  repayment of\n\nthe principal sum and accrued interest.   There is no hint in\n\nthe Notes' language that  the Bank's extension of refinancing\n\nis a condition to  full repayment upon default.   Because the\n\nNotes  are  unambiguous,  appellants  may  not  rely  on  the\n\n                             -10-\n\nCommitment  Letters  to  show that  the  terms  of the  Notes\n\ndiffered from their plain meaning.  Id. \n                                       \n\n          Appellants argue  that the Commitment  Letters were\n\nincorporated  into the  Notes  and thus  the Letters'  terms,\n\nincluding the Letters' references  to refinancing, should  be\n\nconsidered as part and parcel of the parties' agreement.  The\n\nLetters  were entirely  incorporated  into the  Notes, it  is\n\ncontended, because  the Notes \"referred to\"  the Mortgage and\n\nthe Mortgage \"referred to\" the First Commitment Letter.  This\n\noverlooks the  limited nature of the  cross-references.  None\n\nof  the  documents in  question,  nor  anything  else in  the\n\nrecord,  suggests that  the parties  intended  to incorporate\n\neverything said  in the  Commitment Letters as  conditions of\n\nthe Notes.   The Notes  provided that Limehouse  would be  in\n                                               \n\ndefault  of the Note if it defaulted on its obligations under\n                                           \n\nthe  Mortgage  and  Security  Agreement.   The  Mortgage  and\n\nSecurity   Agreement  stated  that   Limehouse  must  perform\n                                              \n\nwhatever obligations  it had  under the  terms  of the  First\n                        \n\nCommitment Letter.  Neither of these references says anything\n\nabout  the  requirement  of monthly  interest  payments,  the\n\nprovision  of  the  Note  as to  which  Limehouse  defaulted.\n\nNothing is anywhere  said that a failure by the  Bank to meet\n\nits  purported  refinancing  assurances  in   the  Commitment\n\nLetters will  constitute a defense to  the borrower's default\n\nupon the Notes.  \n\n                             -11-\n\n          The  Notes  are   at  least  partially   integrated\n\nagreements for  purposes of  the parol evidence  rule.
