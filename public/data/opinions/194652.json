On July 14, 1978,  Judge Edward\n                          \n\nT. Gignoux,  now deceased,  entered a consent  decree in  the\n\ndistrict  court settling a class  action.  The  suit had been\n\nbrought  under 42  U.S.C.    1983 against  a number  of state\n\nofficials  in  Maine,  including the  Commissioner  of Mental\n\nHealth,  on behalf  of  a class  of  mentally retarded  Maine\n\ncitizens.  A focus of the suit was the operation of  Pineland\n\nCenter, a state institution for the mentally retarded.\n\n     The 1978  consent decree embodied two  sets of standards\n\nto improve  care and  promote a less  restrictive environment\n\nfor  class members.  One  set applied to  Pineland Center and\n\nthe other  to community  placement programs for  the Center's\n\noutpatients.   The 1978 decree  provided that it  and the two\n\nsets  of standards  were  binding upon  defendants and  their\n\nsuccessors,  that  a special  master  would  be appointed  to\n\nmonitor   implementation,  that  the  court  would  \"retain[]\n\njurisdiction  over  this  matter  for  two  years\"  and  then\n\nconsider whether  to retain it further, and that \"[a]ny party\n\nmay, at any time,  apply\" to the court  for any necessary  or\n\nappropriate orders.\n\n     In fact  Judge Gignoux  continued active  supervision of\n\nthe case  for about five years.   In brief, on  September 18,\n\n1981,  Judge  Gignoux  discharged  Pineland  Center from  the\n\ncourt's  \"jurisdiction\" and  \"supervision\" after  the special\n\nmaster  submitted a  report finding  that the  Center  was in\n\n                             -2-\n\ncompliance with the standards applicable to  it.  The special\n\nmaster said in the same report that the Center would continue\n\nto  be  bound by  the decree  after  its discharge  and would\n\nthereafter  be  monitored by  the  state's  Bureau of  Mental\n\nRetardation.    \n\n     Then, on November 22, 1983, the court held a hearing and\n\nissued  a   further  order  in  which   it  \"approve[d]\"  new\n\nrecommendations of the special master, terminated his office,\n\nand   \"discharged\"  the   remaining   defendants  \"from   the\n\nsupervision of the  Court.\"   The 1983  order further  stated\n\nthat  it,  and the  standards  adopted  in  the 1978  consent\n\ndecree,  \"shall  be  applicable   to  and  binding  upon  the\n\ndefendants and their successors.\"  Finally, in the order  the\n\ncourt \"reserve[d] jurisdiction over the  case for a period of\n\nthree  years,\"  which might  be  shortened  or extended  upon\n\nmotion.   In his  report, the  special master explained  that\n\n\"the  standards  in  the   Consent  Decree  remain  in  force\n\nindefinitely . . . .\"\n\n     After the 1983 order,  no further motions were  filed or\n\nentries made in the docket for almost eight years.   Then, on\n\nOctober  23, 1991, the Consumer Advisory Board and a group of\n\nPineland  Center residents, outpatients and guardians brought\n\nthis  action on  behalf of  Center residents  and outpatients\n\nagainst  the Commissioner  of Mental  Health and  other state\n\nofficials,  seeking \"enforcement\" of rights created under the\n\n                             -3-\n\n1978  consent decree.1  Ignoring the formality of the new law\n\nsuit, the parties, and Judge D. Brock Hornby to whom the case\n\nwas assigned, have sensibly  treated the new action as  if it\n\nwere a motion filed in the earlier action to seek enforcement\n\nof the 1978 decree.  \n\n     In the  district court the defendants  asserted that the\n\n1978  decree had been terminated  by the 1983  order no later\n\nthan three years after the entry of that order, so that there\n\nwas no consent decree to enforce.  Judge Hornby agreed.  In a\n\nmemorandum decision, Judge Hornby concluded that the question\n\nwas  what Judge  Gignoux  meant in  his  1983 order.    After\n\nreviewing the language  of the 1983 order  and other indicia,\n\nJudge Hornby  found that Judge Gignoux  intended to terminate\n\nthe court's  authority to  enforce the  1978 decree  and made\n\nthis intent  clear.  Judge  Hornby then  dismissed the  case,\n\nwithout   prejudice  to  a   new  action   asserting  present\n\nviolations  of  federal  law  by  defendants.    This  appeal\n\nfollowed.2\n\n                    \n\n     1The Consumer Advisory Board was an entity created under\nthe  decree  to  monitor  performance  and  carry  out  other\nfunctions.   Although the state  has a footnote  in its brief\nsaying that it  does not concede  that the Consumer  Advisory\nBoard has standing, it does not argue the issue in this court\nnor does it question the standing of the other plaintiffs.\n\n     2So that  this case does  not appear a  sterile argument\nabout  captions, we  note that  the state  agrees that  a new\naction  charging  present  federal  law  violations could  be\nbrought;  but at the same  time, it asserts  that federal law\nhas changed since  the 1978 consent decree, see  Youngberg v.\n                                                          \nRomeo, 457  U.S. 307  (1982), and  that the original  consent\n     \n\n                             -4-\n\n     We believe that  the dismissal must  be vacated and  the\n\ncase remanded  for further  proceedings.  We  think it  plain\n\nthat the 1978 consent decree  had no express termination date\n\nand that any intent to terminate it must be based  upon later\n\nevents.  Whatever one might make of the reference in the 1978\n\nconsent decree to the  court's retaining jurisdiction for two\n\nyears, Judge  Gignoux actively  supervised the case  for five\n\nyears  after entry  of  the decree  in  1978 and  the  decree\n\nprovisions  themselves  contained  no  specific  time  limit.\n\nJudge  Hornby  was therefore  quite  right to  focus,  as the\n\nparties in this court  do, on the 1983 order  and surrounding\n\nevents.  \n\n     We reject any suggestion  by the Consumer Advisory Board\n\nthat  the intent of the litigants in 1978 controls this case.\n\nIt  is quite  true  that consent  decrees  are a  mixture  of\n\njudgment  and contract  and that  contract doctrine  is often\n\nused to determine the  meaning of terms in a decree.   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.  ITT Continental Baking  Co., 420 U.S.  223, 236-37\n                                     \n\n(1975).  But even if we assume that both sides in 1978 viewed\n\nthe decree as permanent, the district court has full power to\n\nterminate a  continuing consent  decree of  this kind  upon a\n\ndetermination that  it has achieved its purpose  or no longer\n\nserves the  public interest.   Fed. R. Civ.  P. 60(b);  In re\n                                                             \n\nDonald Pearson,  No. 92-2158, slip.  op. at 10-11  (1st Cir.,\n              \n\n                    \n\ndecree provisions would not be adopted today. \n\n                             -5-\n\nMarch  16,   1993).     Ongoing  decrees  to   reform  public\n\ninstitutions,  whether consented  to or  not, are  adopted by\n\ncourts  subject  to that  power,  regardless  of whether  the\n\nparties  would  like  to  bind  the  court  forever.

If its\n\nimport depended solely  upon Judge Gignoux's private  intent,\n\nthis would be  a very close case.  But  it is Judge Gignoux's\n\nexpressed  intent that  matters,  and the  Supreme Court  has\n         \n\neased  our task by requiring a clear statement of that intent\n\nin  order to terminate the decree.   In Board of Education of\n                                                             \n\nOklahoma City Public Schools  v. Dowell, 111 S. Ct.  630, 636\n                                       \n\n(1991), the Supreme Court held that the continuing injunctive\n\ndecree  at issue  would  be deemed  terminated only  after \"a\n\nrather  precise statement\" of  the district court's intention\n\nto terminate.   See also id. at 641 n. 3 (separate opinion of\n                           \n\nJustice Marshall).   Dowell concerned a  school desegregation\n                           \n\ndecree,  but  we  see no  reason  why  a decree  to  reform a\n\ndifferent kind of state institution should stand on different\n\nfooting.3\n\n                    \n\n     3It may  be that terminating the decree  in Dowell would\n                                                       \nhave  had  a  double impact,  not  only  ending  the existing\nobligations  but making  a new  suit more  difficult for  res\n                                                             \njudicata reasons.   But the  Supreme Court,  in requiring  \"a\n        \nrather precise statement,\" rested  simply on the need to give\ndue notice  to both sides as to the nature of, or changes in,\ndecree obligations.  Id. at 636.\n                       \n\n                             -6-\n\n     The standard is eminently sensible.   Continuing decrees\n\nare  a peculiar  beast in  the  legal menagerie.   Especially\n\nwhere  reform of an institution is involved, a court that has\n\nentered   such  a   decree   may  pass   through  levels   of\n                                                        \n\ndisengagement as the decree  moves toward achievement.  After\n\nentry  of the  decree,  there is  often  a period  of  active\n\ninvolvement--sometimes attended by close supervision, special\n\nmasters,  and adjustment  of time  tables and  other details.\n\nEventually  the court may  withdraw from  active involvement,\n\nand the case may  even be \"closed\" in official  records.  Yet\n\nthe  decree may live  on as a  legal obligation.   If so, the\n\ncourt's authority  to enforce it  is always capable  of being\n\nreawakened.\n\n     To require  a clear statement before  termination serves\n\nseveral ends.   It means that those  subject to a decree know\n\nthat,  absent such a  statement, their  obligations continue.\n\nCf.  Dowell,  111 S.  Ct.  at 636.   A  clear  statement also\n           \n\nassures that those who secured or are protected by the decree\n\nwill be on notice if and when a decree is terminated, so that\n\nthey  can oppose or  appeal this  crucial decision.   Id.   A\n                                                        \n\nclear statement test also reduces  the chance of confusion as\n\nto  whether  the  district   court  has  merely  reduced  its\n\ninvolvement   or  actually   nullified  an   important  legal\n\nobligation.  And to signal termination under this standard is\n\n                             -7-\n\nextremely easy: all a district court need do is say that \"the\n\ndecree is terminated\" or use any similar phrase.\n\n     Here, we  think the state does  have plausible arguments\n\nthat  Judge Gignoux  meant to terminate  the decree,  but the\n\nother side  has arguments of  equivalent force.   Thus, Judge\n\nGignoux  did  say in  his November  22,  1983, order  that he\n\n\"discharged\"  defendants from  the court's  \"supervision\" and\n\n\"reserve[d] jurisdiction\" over the case for three years.  But\n\nthe  discharge  from  supervision  clearly did  not  end  the\n\ndecree,4 and the term \"jurisdiction,\" while more  portentous,\n\nis a term of  many shadings.  There is more  than one case in\n\nwhich a district court has terminated its \"jurisdiction\" over\n\na  decree, intending  only to  close the  case on  its docket\n\nlist, and  without meaning  to terminate  ongoing obligations\n\nunder the decree.5\n\n                    \n\n     4Whether  the  state was  in  full  compliance with  the\ndecree as of November 22, 1983, or instead on a course toward\nfull  compliance, is  not  entirely clear  from the  several,\nsometimes  inconsistent  remarks  of  Judge  Gignoux  and the\nspecial master.   But the  court's order of  that date,  just\nbefore  retaining  jurisdiction, says  that  \"this Order  and\nAppendices A and B  [which were attached to the  1978 consent\ndecree and  contained the  standards] shall be  applicable to\nand binding upon the defendants and their successors . . . .\"\n\n     5In addition to Dowell  itself, where the district court\n                           \nhad entered an order  terminating its \"jurisdiction\" over the\ncase, see e.g., Youngblood v. Dalzell, 925 F.2d 954, 955, 957\n                                     \n(6th Cir. 1991)  (district court terminated its  jurisdiction\nover consent decree and  \"closed\" the case without dissolving\nthe  decree), and Roberts v.  St. Regis Paper,  653 F.2d 166,\n                                             \n171-72  (5th Cir.  1981)  (decree's  provision providing  for\ntermination  of jurisdiction  did  not conflict  with another\ndecree provision establishing a \"permanent\" seniority system,\n\n                             -8-\n\n     The defendants  also rely heavily upon  the statement of\n\nJudge  Gignoux, at  the hearing held  on the same  day as the\n\n1983  order, that the order  marked \"the end  of this Federal\n\nCourt's   involvement  with  Maine's  care  of  the  mentally\n\nretarded.\"  This statement cannot be taken literally, for the\n\nstate clearly remained bound  by the terms of the  decree for\n\nat  least another  three  years.   Moreover, Judge  Gignoux's\n\nstatement  must  be  read  in  the  context of  a  proceeding\n\ncelebrating the progress made by the state.  And the Consumer\n\nAdvisory  Board  has arguments  of  its  own, including  firm\n\nstatements of the special master--apparently  never contested\n\nuntil  now--that the  decree was  an ongoing  obligation that\n\nwould  endure well  after  initial  compliance was  achieved.\n\nTaking into account both  the language of the 1983  order and\n\nthe surrounding circumstances, we think that the order  is at\n\nbest ambiguous.6\n\n                    \n\nas  jurisdiction did not \"refer[]  to the life  of the decree\nitself\").  See generally  Anderson, Release and Resumption of\n                                                             \nJurisdiction   Over  Consent  Decrees  in  Structural  Reform\n                                                             \nLitigation, 42 U. Miami L. Rev. 401, 404, 413 (1987).  \n          \n\n     6There  is  nothing  wrong,  where  decree  language  is\nambiguous, in  looking to surrounding  circumstances.  Still,\nthe  further away  such evidence  takes us  from the  case at\nhand, the more doubtful its value and the less bearing it has\non the district court's expressed intent.  For that reason we\n                                 \nneed not discuss at  length a different case (Inmates  of the\n                                                             \nMe.

Me.\n                           \nMay  10, 1987)) which the state offers as a parallel instance\nof Judge Gignoux using \"jurisdiction\" language to terminate a\ndecree.  \n\n                             -9-\n\n     In  sum,  a continuing  obligation  was  created by  the\n\noriginal  1978 consent decree.  Nothing in the 1983 order and\n\nsurrounding  circumstances  comprises  \"the   rather  precise\n\nstatement\" needed  under  Dowell  to  terminate  the  decree.\n                                \n\nInterpretation of the  1983 order presents a  question of law\n\nopen to plenary review, e.g., Suburban O'Hare Com'n  v.

On July 14, 1978,  Judge Edward\n                          \n\nT. Gignoux,  now deceased,  entered a consent  decree in  the\n\ndistrict  court settling a class  action.  The  suit had been\n\nbrought  under 42  U.S.C.    1983 against  a number  of state\n\nofficials  in  Maine,  including the  Commissioner  of Mental\n\nHealth,  on behalf  of  a class  of  mentally retarded  Maine\n\ncitizens.  A focus of the suit was the operation of  Pineland\n\nCenter, a state institution for the mentally retarded.\n\n     The 1978  consent decree embodied two  sets of standards\n\nto improve  care and  promote a less  restrictive environment\n\nfor  class members.  One  set applied to  Pineland Center and\n\nthe other  to community  placement programs for  the Center's\n\noutpatients.   The 1978 decree  provided that it  and the two\n\nsets  of standards  were  binding upon  defendants and  their\n\nsuccessors,  that  a special  master  would  be appointed  to\n\nmonitor   implementation,  that  the  court  would  \"retain[]\n\njurisdiction  over  this  matter  for  two  years\"  and  then\n\nconsider whether  to retain it further, and that \"[a]ny party\n\nmay, at any time,  apply\" to the court  for any necessary  or\n\nappropriate orders.\n\n     In fact  Judge Gignoux  continued active  supervision of\n\nthe case  for about five years.   In brief, on  September 18,\n\n1981,  Judge  Gignoux  discharged  Pineland  Center from  the\n\ncourt's  \"jurisdiction\" and  \"supervision\" after  the special\n\nmaster  submitted a  report finding  that the  Center  was in\n\n                             -2-\n\ncompliance with the standards applicable to  it.  The special\n\nmaster said in the same report that the Center would continue\n\nto  be  bound by  the decree  after  its discharge  and would\n\nthereafter  be  monitored by  the  state's  Bureau of  Mental\n\nRetardation.    \n\n     Then, on November 22, 1983, the court held a hearing and\n\nissued  a   further  order  in  which   it  \"approve[d]\"  new\n\nrecommendations of the special master, terminated his office,\n\nand   \"discharged\"  the   remaining   defendants  \"from   the\n\nsupervision of the  Court.\"   The 1983  order further  stated\n\nthat  it,  and the  standards  adopted  in  the 1978  consent\n\ndecree,  \"shall  be  applicable   to  and  binding  upon  the\n\ndefendants and their successors.\"  Finally, in the order  the\n\ncourt \"reserve[d] jurisdiction over the  case for a period of\n\nthree  years,\"  which might  be  shortened  or extended  upon\n\nmotion.   In his  report, the  special master explained  that\n\n\"the  standards  in  the   Consent  Decree  remain  in  force\n\nindefinitely . . . .\"\n\n     After the 1983 order,  no further motions were  filed or\n\nentries made in the docket for almost eight years.   Then, on\n\nOctober  23, 1991, the Consumer Advisory Board and a group of\n\nPineland  Center residents, outpatients and guardians brought\n\nthis  action on  behalf of  Center residents  and outpatients\n\nagainst  the Commissioner  of Mental  Health and  other state\n\nofficials,  seeking \"enforcement\" of rights created under the\n\n                             -3-\n\n1978  consent decree.1  Ignoring the formality of the new law\n\nsuit, the parties, and Judge D. Brock Hornby to whom the case\n\nwas assigned, have sensibly  treated the new action as  if it\n\nwere a motion filed in the earlier action to seek enforcement\n\nof the 1978 decree.  \n\n     In the  district court the defendants  asserted that the\n\n1978  decree had been terminated  by the 1983  order no later\n\nthan three years after the entry of that order, so that there\n\nwas no consent decree to enforce.  Judge Hornby agreed.  In a\n\nmemorandum decision, Judge Hornby concluded that the question\n\nwas  what Judge  Gignoux  meant in  his  1983 order.    After\n\nreviewing the language  of the 1983 order  and other indicia,\n\nJudge Hornby  found that Judge Gignoux  intended to terminate\n\nthe court's  authority to  enforce the  1978 decree  and made\n\nthis intent  clear.  Judge  Hornby then  dismissed the  case,\n\nwithout   prejudice  to  a   new  action   asserting  present\n\nviolations  of  federal  law  by  defendants.    This  appeal\n\nfollowed.2\n\n                    \n\n     1The Consumer Advisory Board was an entity created under\nthe  decree  to  monitor  performance  and  carry  out  other\nfunctions.   Although the state  has a footnote  in its brief\nsaying that it  does not concede  that the Consumer  Advisory\nBoard has standing, it does not argue the issue in this court\nnor does it question the standing of the other plaintiffs.\n\n     2So that  this case does  not appear a  sterile argument\nabout  captions, we  note that  the state  agrees that  a new\naction  charging  present  federal  law  violations could  be\nbrought;  but at the same  time, it asserts  that federal law\nhas changed since  the 1978 consent decree, see  Youngberg v.\n                                                          \nRomeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110746\"><a href=\"/opinion/110746/youngberg-v-romeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1982), and  that the original  consent\n     \n\n                             -4-\n\n     We believe that  the dismissal must  be vacated and  the\n\ncase remanded  for further  proceedings.  We  think it  plain\n\nthat the 1978 consent decree  had no express termination date\n\nand that any intent to terminate it must be based  upon later\n\nevents.  Whatever one might make of the reference in the 1978\n\nconsent decree to the  court's retaining jurisdiction for two\n\nyears, Judge  Gignoux actively  supervised the case  for five\n\nyears  after entry  of  the decree  in  1978 and  the  decree\n\nprovisions  themselves  contained  no  specific  time  limit.\n\nJudge  Hornby  was therefore  quite  right to  focus,  as the\n\nparties in this court  do, on the 1983 order  and surrounding\n\nevents.  \n\n     We reject any suggestion  by the Consumer Advisory Board\n\nthat  the intent of the litigants in 1978 controls this case.\n\nIt  is quite  true  that consent  decrees  are a  mixture  of\n\njudgment  and contract  and that  contract doctrine  is often\n\nused to determine the  meaning of terms in a decree.

But even if we assume that both sides in 1978 viewed\n\nthe decree as permanent, the district court has full power to\n\nterminate a  continuing consent  decree of  this kind  upon a\n\ndetermination that  it has achieved its purpose  or no longer\n\nserves the  public interest.

See also id. at 641 n. 3 (separate opinion of\n                           \n\nJustice Marshall).   Dowell concerned a  school desegregation\n                           \n\ndecree,  but  we  see no  reason  why  a decree  to  reform a\n\ndifferent kind of state institution should stand on different\n\nfooting.3\n\n                    \n\n     3It may  be that terminating the decree  in Dowell would\n                                                       \nhave  had  a  double impact,  not  only  ending  the existing\nobligations  but making  a new  suit more  difficult for  res\n                                                             \njudicata reasons.   But the  Supreme Court,  in requiring  \"a\n        \nrather precise statement,\" rested  simply on the need to give\ndue notice  to both sides as to the nature of, or changes in,\ndecree obligations.  Id. at 636.\n                       \n\n                             -6-\n\n     The standard is eminently sensible.   Continuing decrees\n\nare  a peculiar  beast in  the  legal menagerie.   Especially\n\nwhere  reform of an institution is involved, a court that has\n\nentered   such  a   decree   may  pass   through  levels   of\n                                                        \n\ndisengagement as the decree  moves toward achievement.  After\n\nentry  of the  decree,  there is  often  a period  of  active\n\ninvolvement--sometimes attended by close supervision, special\n\nmasters,  and adjustment  of time  tables and  other details.\n\nEventually  the court may  withdraw from  active involvement,\n\nand the case may  even be \"closed\" in official  records.  Yet\n\nthe  decree may live  on as a  legal obligation.   If so, the\n\ncourt's authority  to enforce it  is always capable  of being\n\nreawakened.\n\n     To require  a clear statement before  termination serves\n\nseveral ends.   It means that those  subject to a decree know\n\nthat,  absent such a  statement, their  obligations continue.\n\nCf.  Dowell,  111 S.  Ct.  at 636.   A  clear  statement also\n           \n\nassures that those who secured or are protected by the decree\n\nwill be on notice if and when a decree is terminated, so that\n\nthey  can oppose or  appeal this  crucial decision.   Id.   A\n                                                        \n\nclear statement test also reduces  the chance of confusion as\n\nto  whether  the  district   court  has  merely  reduced  its\n\ninvolvement   or  actually   nullified  an   important  legal\n\nobligation.  And to signal termination under this standard is\n\n                             -7-\n\nextremely easy: all a district court need do is say that \"the\n\ndecree is terminated\" or use any similar phrase.\n\n     Here, we  think the state does  have plausible arguments\n\nthat  Judge Gignoux  meant to terminate  the decree,  but the\n\nother side  has arguments of  equivalent force.   Thus, Judge\n\nGignoux  did  say in  his November  22,  1983, order  that he\n\n\"discharged\"  defendants from  the court's  \"supervision\" and\n\n\"reserve[d] jurisdiction\" over the case for three years.  But\n\nthe  discharge  from  supervision  clearly did  not  end  the\n\ndecree,4 and the term \"jurisdiction,\" while more  portentous,\n\nis a term of  many shadings.  There is more  than one case in\n\nwhich a district court has terminated its \"jurisdiction\" over\n\na  decree, intending  only to  close the  case on  its docket\n\nlist, and  without meaning  to terminate  ongoing obligations\n\nunder the decree.5\n\n                    \n\n     4Whether  the  state was  in  full  compliance with  the\ndecree as of November 22, 1983, or instead on a course toward\nfull  compliance, is  not  entirely clear  from the  several,\nsometimes  inconsistent  remarks  of  Judge  Gignoux  and the\nspecial master.   But the  court's order of  that date,  just\nbefore  retaining  jurisdiction, says  that  \"this Order  and\nAppendices A and B  [which were attached to the  1978 consent\ndecree and  contained the  standards] shall be  applicable to\nand binding upon the defendants and their successors . . . .\"\n\n     5In addition to Dowell  itself, where the district court\n                           \nhad entered an order  terminating its \"jurisdiction\" over the\ncase, see e.g., Youngblood v.

Moreover, Judge  Gignoux's\n\nstatement  must  be  read  in  the  context of  a  proceeding\n\ncelebrating the progress made by the state.  And the Consumer\n\nAdvisory  Board  has arguments  of  its  own, including  firm\n\nstatements of the special master--apparently  never contested\n\nuntil  now--that the  decree was  an ongoing  obligation that\n\nwould  endure well  after  initial  compliance was  achieved.\n\nTaking into account both  the language of the 1983  order and\n\nthe surrounding circumstances, we think that the order  is at\n\nbest ambiguous.6\n\n                    \n\nas  jurisdiction did not \"refer[]  to the life  of the decree\nitself\").  See generally  Anderson, Release and Resumption of\n                                                             \nJurisdiction   Over  Consent  Decrees  in  Structural  Reform\n                                                             \nLitigation, 42 U. Miami L. Rev. 401, 404, 413 (1987).  \n          \n\n     6There  is  nothing  wrong,  where  decree  language  is\nambiguous, in  looking to surrounding  circumstances.  Still,\nthe  further away  such evidence  takes us  from the  case at\nhand, the more doubtful its value and the less bearing it has\non the district court's expressed intent.  For that reason we\n                                 \nneed not discuss at  length a different case (Inmates  of the\n                                                             \nMe.  State Prison v. Oliver, No. 11-187-S-D, slip op. (D. Me.\n                           \nMay  10, 1987)) which the state offers as a parallel instance\nof Judge Gignoux using \"jurisdiction\" language to terminate a\ndecree.  \n\n                             -9-\n\n     In  sum,  a continuing  obligation  was  created by  the\n\noriginal  1978 consent decree.  Nothing in the 1983 order and\n\nsurrounding  circumstances  comprises  \"the   rather  precise\n\nstatement\" needed  under  Dowell  to  terminate  the  decree.\n                                \n\nInterpretation of the  1983 order presents a  question of law\n\nopen to plenary review, e.g., Suburban O'Hare Com'n  v. Dole,\n                                                            \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"467564\"><a href=\"/opinion/467564/suburban-ohare-commission-v-elizabeth-hanford-dole-secretary-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  193 (7th  Cir.), cert.  denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n                                              \n\n(1986),  and our  disagreement with  the able  district judge\n\nsimply underscores that the issue is fairly open to debate.\n\n     The  Supreme Court's  requirement  of a  rather  precise\n\nstatement  to  terminate consent  decrees  is  not the  whole\n\nstory.    In Dowell  the Supreme  Court  has made  clear that\n                   \n\ninstitutional reform decrees need not endure forever.  111 S.\n\nCt. at  637.  See also  Fed. R. Civ. P.  60(b); Pearson, slip\n                                                       \n\nop. at  9-11.  Rather,  the district  court has  considerable\n\ndiscretion,  especially  after years  of  apparent compliance\n\nhave passed, to conclude that the decree  should be dissolved\n\nbecause it has achieved  its purpose or no longer  serves the\n\npublic  interest.   That  remedy--which can  be invoked  by a\n\nmotion to  terminate the  1978 consent  decree--remains fully\n\navailable to the state.  We note the point not to express any\n\nview upon the merits of such a motion but to  make clear that\n\nthe Dowell  requirement of  a rather  precise statement  is a\n          \n\nprocedural dictate and not  a presumption that decrees should\n\nlive forever.\n\n                             -10-\n\n     The judgment of  the district court  is vacated and  the\n                                                    \n\ncase remanded for further proceedings.  No costs.\n\n                             -11-\n</pre>",
