Williams on brief for appellant.\n                        \n     Edwin  J. Gale,  United  States  Attorney,  and  Charles  A.\n                                                                 \nTamuleviz,  Assistant  United  States  Attorney,  on   brief  for\n         \nappellee.\n\n                                          \n\n                                          \n\n            Per Curiam.    The defendant, in the course  of being\n                      \n\narrested  and  booked in  connection  with fraudulent  income tax\n\nclaims, was asked  routine booking question including  his social\n\nsecurity number.   He gave a false one and, despite his effort to\n\nsuppress the statement, was charged  and convicted of deceptively\n\nmisrepresenting his social security number.  \n\n            We find no merit in  defendant's argument that asking\n\ndefendant  his  social security  number  \"related directly  to an\n\nelement  of  the crime  the  agents  had reason  to  suspect\" and\n\ntherefore  was  \"designed  to  elicit  incriminatory  admissions\"\n\nwithin the meaning  of Pennsylvania v.  Muniz, 496 U.S. 582,  602\n                                             \n\nn.14 (1990).  When defendant was  arrested at the post office, he\n\nwas  suspected of  involvement  in the  submission  of false  tax\n\nrefund claims in the names of Micheal M. Lerner and Jose A. Silva\n\nin  violation of 18  U.S.C.   287.   So far  as appears, however,\n\ndefendant did not  represent himself to be Lerner  or Silva or to\n\nhave their social security numbers.  Instead, after being advised\n\nof his Miranda  rights, defendant denied  the post office box  to\n              \n\nwhich  the decoy refund checks had been sent was his, claimed the\n\nbox belonged to a friend, and said he did not know anything about\n\nthe  refund checks.  Consequently, by  the time the IRS agent and\n\ndeputy marshal asked  defendant his social security  number, they\n\nwould not have  reasonably expected that question, or its answer,\n\nto implicate defendant  in the offenses then  under investigation\n\n(the filing  of false  income tax claims).   In fact,  the answer\n\n                               -2-\n\ndefendant  gave did not  implicate defendant in  the filing false\n\nincome  tax  claims  charges.    Instead, defendant  committed  a\n\ncompletely separate offense   -- giving  a false social  security\n\nnumber with intent to deceive, 42 U.S.C.     408(g)(2)(1988).\n\n            Nor was asking  defendant his social security  number\n\ndesigned  to   goad  defendant   into  violating   42  U.S.C.    \n\n408(g)(2)(1988).  There  is no evidence  the IRS agent or  deputy\n\nmarshal knew defendant was an illegal  alien, 20 C.F.R.   422.104\n                                     \n\n(indicating  that  certain  legal  aliens  may  obtain  a  social\n\nsecurity number), and,  in any event, had defendant  answered the\n\nquestion truthfully, he would have  neither implicated himself in\n\nthe  offenses  then  under  investigation  (filing  false  refund\n\nclaims) nor violated 42 U.S.C.   408 (g)(2)(1988).  \n\n            Finding  no   merit  in   defendant's  argument,   we\n\nsummarily affirm the judgment below.
