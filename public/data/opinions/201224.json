Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                          Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                   Rosenn, Senior Circuit Judge,* and\n                         Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Mark J. Balthazard, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Michael\nJ. Sullivan, U.S. Attorney, was on brief, for appellant.\n     James C. Rehnquist, with whom Sarah E. Walters, Miriam Kim,\nand Goodwin Procter LLP were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                             August 30, 2004\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the      Third   Circuit     Court   of   Appeals,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            LYNCH,   Circuit       Judge.     This    workers'    compensation\n\ninsurance fraud criminal case produced an appeal from both sides.\n\nThe government appeals the district court's dismissal of two counts\n\non which a jury had convicted, while the defendant cross-appeals on\n\nthe ground that the entire case should have been dismissed because\n\nof an alleged violation of the grand jury secrecy rule, embodied in\n\nFed.   R.   Crim.    P.    6(e).       We    conclude,    despite      the   able\n\nrepresentation of Pimental, that (1) the district court erred in\n\ndismissing the two counts and we reinstate the jury convictions and\n\nconclude that (2) there was no violation by the prosecution here of\n\nRule 6(e)     at   all.    This     second   point   is   a   matter   of    first\n\nimpression.\n\n            After a jury convicted Arthur Pimental of two counts of\n\nmail fraud, the district court dismissed the convictions because it\n\nfound that the two underlying mailings were not \"in furtherance\" of\n\nPimental's fraudulent scheme.          United States v. Pimental, 236 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 99 (D. Mass. 2002).         Pimental's scheme involved lying to\n\nvarious workers' compensation insurance company representatives\n\nabout the nature and scope of his company's work; his false\n\nstatements tended to reduce the premium payments he owed for\n\nworkers'    compensation    insurance.        The    government   appeals     the\n\ndistrict court's decision, arguing that the two mailings furthered\n\nPimental's scheme by helping to ensure that the insurance company\n\ndid not discover his earlier misrepresentations.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f          Pimental         cross-appeals,            arguing     that     his   indictment\n\nshould be dismissed because the prosecuting attorney disclosed\n\nsecret   grand      jury     materials          to     an   investigator         for     the\n\nMassachusetts Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB).                      Pimental argues that\n\nthe rule allowing disclosure of grand jury materials to \"government\n\npersonnel\"     in    certain           circumstances,          Fed.       R.    Crim.     P.\n\n6(e)(3)(a)(ii), was inapplicable because the IFB investigator was\n\na private actor.      The IFB, which investigates potential cases of\n\ninsurance fraud, is authorized and structured by Massachusetts\n\nstatute, but partially run and entirely funded by insurers.\n\n          We reverse the district court's dismissal of Pimental's\n\nconvictions,     finding        that    the   mailings         by    insurance     company\n\nrepresentatives      that       formed    the    basis      of      the   two   counts    of\n\nconviction were indeed in furtherance of Pimental's fraudulent\n\nscheme. Additionally, we reject Pimental's cross-appeal because we\n\nconclude that the first district court (not the trial court) did\n\nnot err when it found the IFB investigators here are \"government\n\npersonnel\" within the meaning of Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(A)(ii)\n\nand so authorized the prosecutor to reveal grand jury materials to\n\nthem.\n\n                           I.    Factual Background\n\n             The facts are described in the light most favorable to\n\nthe jury's guilty verdict.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f           Arthur Pimental and his wife, Loretta Pimental (for ease\n\nof reference we refer to her as Loretta and to Arthur as Pimental),\n\nowned and operated Pimental Steel Erectors (\"Pimental Steel\")\n\nstarting sometime in the early 1980's.       In late 1989, Pimental\n\nSteel allowed its workers' compensation insurance to lapse; this\n\nviolated Massachusetts law.   Massachusetts requires all employers\n\nto maintain workers' compensation insurance which covers their\n\nemployees in the case of an on-the-job injury or job-related\n\nillness.   Mass. Gen. L. ch. 152, § 25A.   Over three years later, in\n\nApril 1993, Arthur Pimental mailed a written application to the\n\nMassachusetts Workers' Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau\n\n(MWCRIB) to resume Pimental Steel's workers' compensation coverage.\n\nMWCRIB, a private non-profit association of insurers that is\n\nlicensed under Massachusetts law, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 152. § 52C,\n\nuses a risk pool to assign insurance companies to provide workers'\n\ncompensation insurance on pre-set terms to applicant-employers.\n\nThe fraud charges started here.\n\n           On the MWCRIB application form, Pimental described the\n\noperations of his business as involving \"concrete construction\n\nincl[uding] foundations\" and added that it \"puts in foundations.\"\n\nConcrete foundation work involves laying concrete and reinforcing\n\nit with steel rods and is also known as \"rebar.\"    MWCRIB processed\n\nthe application, assigned it to the Hartford Fire Insurance Company\n\n(\"Hartford Insurance\"), and notified Pimental via the mail that the\n\n\n                                -4-\n\festimated premium for the year, based on his application, was\n\n$12,425.\n\n            Despite what was said in the MWCRIB application, Pimental\n\nSteel had never at any point been involved in concrete foundation\n\nwork.      Rather,      throughout     the   relevant    period,   its      business\n\nperformed mainly steel erection and related work, such as welding\n\nand decking.      Steel erection involves the placement of girders,\n\ncolumns, and joints to support a structure, then laying corrugated-\n\nmetal decking for the ceiling and floors of the building and\n\nwelding    it     into    place.        Steel    erection      work    carries    a\n\nsignificantly higher risk of injury than does concrete foundation\n\nwork.\n\n             Because workers' compensation premiums are set based upon\n\nthe kind of work performed and the amount of a business's payroll,\n\nPimental's incorrect description on the MWCRIB application affected\n\nthe premium payments Pimental Steel owed.                 In 1993, the premium\n\npayment for steel erection of structures over two stories was\n\n$99.35 per every hundred dollars of payroll1 (reduced to $69.22 for\n\nstructures under two stories), while the rate was $41.22 for\n\nconcrete foundation work.             Some of the work that Pimental Steel\n\nactually performed, however, had lower premium rates than concrete\n\nfoundation      work:    the   rate   for    decking    was   $24.66   or   $19.82,\n\n\n\n     1\n      All subsequent references to premium rates are per hundred\ndollars of payroll.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fdepending on the type of metal used, while the rate for welding was\n\n$23.56. Where, as in the case of Pimental Steel, employees perform\n\ntasks that have different premium rates, the total premium cost can\n\nbe calculated by parsing out the hours that employees spent on each\n\ndifferent task, so long as appropriate documentation is maintained.\n\nOne witness testified that 80% of the work Pimental Steel did for\n\nhim was steel erection and decking and that the remaining 20% was\n\n\"miscellaneous.\"\n\n          In September of 1993, Joseph F. Brugman, an auditor for\n\nHartford Insurance, met with Loretta Pimental to perform an initial\n\naudit on Pimental Steel's insurance application.          In addition to\n\nsuch initial audits, which are conducted at the start of an\n\ninsurer's relationship with an insured, insurers normally perform\n\naudits once a year at the conclusion of each annual policy period.\n\nThe auditors determine the insurance classification for the work\n\nthat the insured's employees performed and the total amount of\n\nsalary paid   to   them.   Using    this   information,   the   insurance\n\ncompanies calculate the final amount that the employer owes for the\n\nyear.\n\n          During the initial audit meeting, Loretta told Brugman\n\nthat Pimental Steel was, as the MWCRIB application had represented,\n\ninvolved in concrete foundation work.        She did not tell Brugman\n\nthat Pimental Steel was involved in any way in steel erection,\n\nwelding, or decking, even though Brugman explained to her that\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fPimental     Steel's    operations           could    be    split   into     different\n\nclassifications for insurance purposes.                     At the later year-end\n\naudit in July 1994, also conducted by Brugman, Loretta repeated\n\nthis description of Pimental Steel's business operations.\n\n            Several     months       after    Brugman      conducted   his    year-end\n\naudit,   William     Brooks,     a    loss-control         inspector   for    Hartford\n\nInsurance, met with Arthur Pimental.                 In contrast to auditors, the\n\npurpose of loss-control inspectors is not to verify the accuracy of\n\nthe information given by policyholders, but instead to \"assist[]\n\npolicyholders in their efforts to control costly accidents and/or\n\ninjuries.\"     During that meeting Pimental once again represented,\n\nwrongly, that his business involved rebar.                     Pimental also told\n\nBrooks that he did not currently have any employees and that there\n\nwere not any ongoing projects that Brooks could observe.                      This was\n\nalso not true: Pimental paid an employee wages three days after his\n\nmeeting with Brugman.\n\n             On October 5, 1994, Brooks mailed an \"Account Data\n\nReport\" to Hartford Insurance that summarized his meeting with\n\nPimental.      The     letter    began       by   stating    that   \"[t]he     insured\n\ndescribes his business []as that of the installation of reenforcing\n\nbars and rods for floors and walls.\" Brooks's standard practice is\n\nto inform insureds that he will turn over a copy of his loss-\n\ncontrol report to the insurance company, and that the company will\n\ninform the employer of any recommendations to improve worker\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fsafety.     However,   Brooks    testified   that    he   had   no   specific\n\nrecollection of whether he had informed Pimental of this procedure\n\nduring their meeting.\n\n            The   Pimentals     renewed   their    workers'     compensation\n\ninsurance coverage with Hartford Insurance in May 1995.              Hartford\n\nsent them a letter detailing the terms of coverage; under the\n\nheading \"Business of Named Insured,\" the letter read \"concrete\n\nconstruction.\"     In July 1995, Hartford auditor Mark Lawrence met\n\nwith Loretta Pimental to conduct an audit of the May 1994 to May\n\n1995 policy period. During that meeting, Lawrence asked Loretta if\n\nthe company did any steel erection work, given that the company's\n\nname is \"Pimental Steel Erectors.\"           Loretta responded that the\n\ncompany only did concrete rebar work, and did not work on steel\n\nerection, despite its name.\n\n            Lawrence also asked Loretta for documentation of Pimental\n\nSteel's wage payments to employees.          Loretta told Lawrence that\n\nthere was    no   single   record   detailing     payroll.      Instead,   she\n\nprovided him with a checkbook that had been used to make payroll\n\npayments, along with a written summary of that checkbook, and told\n\nhim that there were no additional records.          From these documents,\n\nLawrence calculated that Pimental Steel had paid $28,885 in salary\n\nto its employees for the year from May 1994 to May 1995, resulting\n\nin a total premium of $13,586.        In fact, Pimental Steel's actual\n\npayroll during that period was $85,499, a figure which would have\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fled to a larger premium.        The Pimentals used non-sequentially\n\nnumbered checks in their business and it appears that the single\n\ncheckbook given to Lawrence contained only a fraction of all the\n\nchecks written on behalf of Pimental Steel from the previous year.\n\n          In July 1995, Hartford Insurance attempted to arrange\n\nanother loss-control meeting with Arthur Pimental.       After Pimental\n\ndid not respond to three separate inquiries, Timothy Bergeron, a\n\nSenior Loss-Control Consultant for Hartford Insurance, sent him a\n\nfinal letter stating that \"failure to allow reasonable access for\n\nthe purpose of loss-control consultation is a violation of the good\n\nfaith provisions in the Workers' Compensation Insurance Plan and\n\ncan subject your policy to cancellation.\"        Under that threat of\n\ncancellation, Pimental finally met with Bergeron on September 21,\n\n1995.\n\n          During the meeting, Pimental told Bergeron that Pimental\n\nSteel continued to perform rebar work; he falsely said the company\n\ndid not perform any structural steel erection or metal deck work.\n\nHe also falsely told Bergeron that there were currently no jobs in\n\nprogress that   could    be   inspected.   His   bank   records   reveal,\n\nhowever, that three employees were paid their wages that same day.\n\nDuring the meeting, Bergeron told Pimental that he was going to\n\nprepare a report summarizing their meeting and would mail it to\n\nHartford Insurance.     Bergeron testified that he told Pimental that\n\nhe would send the loss-control report to Hartford Insurance, and\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fBrooks indicated that it was his standard practice to tell the\n\ninsured that the loss-control report would be forwarded to the\n\ninsurance company.         Bergeron kept a copy of the report in Hartford\n\nInsurance's Boston branch (where he was stationed) and sent a copy\n\nto the company's branch in San Antonio, Texas \"that issues the\n\npolicy and distributes all the policies regarding the assigned risk\n\npool.\"     On October 5, 1995, Bergeron also mailed a letter to\n\nPimental summarizing their meeting and stating that \"[y]our company\n\ncontinues to bid work as a subcontractor installing reinforcement\n\nbar.\"\n\n               Pimental     again      renewed     the     company's       workers'\n\ncompensation insurance in May 1996, and Hartford Insurance again\n\nmailed a letter to Pimental detailing the coverage and repeating\n\nthat     the    nature     of   the    company's    business        was   \"concrete\n\nconstruction.\"         Later that summer, Lawrence wrote a letter to the\n\nPimentals requesting certain documents that were needed to perform\n\na year-end audit for the May 1995-to-May 1996 coverage period. The\n\nPimentals      never     provided     Lawrence   with    any   of   the   requested\n\ndocumentation.\n\n               When Lawrence met with Loretta Pimental for the annual\n\naudit on August 9, 1996, the only documentation that she provided\n\nwas Pimental Steel's checkbook; she claimed to have been unaware of\n\nthe records Lawrence had requested and to have lost the letter he\n\nhad sent to her.          As a result, Lawrence determined that Pimental\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fSteel's account was \"unauditable\" and his report to Hartford\n\nInsurance simply estimated a payroll of $31,500 based on the\n\ncheckbook that Loretta had provided.       This estimate was less than\n\n20% of Pimental Steel's actual payroll of $158,653 for that time\n\nperiod.   Consequently, the $19,374 in premiums that the Pimentals\n\nwere charged was also less than 20% of what they actually owed.\n\n            In November 1996, Arthur Pimental, perhaps concerned that\n\nHartford Insurance might cancel Pimental Steel's policy for failure\n\nto provide requested documentation, submitted a second application\n\nfor workers' compensation insurance to MWCRIB.          This application\n\ncontained a new name for the company; it was now called A.P.S.\n\nProducts, Inc., rather than Pimental Steel Erectors. (We continue\n\nto refer to Pimental's company as \"Pimental Steel\" despite this\n\nname change).    The application once again described the company's\n\noperations as \"[i]nstall steel for concrete reinforcement,\" and\n\nstated that its total payroll was $65,000 per year and that it\n\nemployed only two workers.      During the previous six months, the\n\nPimentals' company actually paid salary to between four and seven\n\nemployees on a weekly basis, and the company's payroll for those\n\nsix months totaled approximately $83,000.\n\n            MWCRIB assigned the insurance application to Employers\n\nInsurance   of   Wausau   (Wausau   Insurance)   and   sent   a   letter   to\n\nPimental informing him of the assignment and stating that the\n\nestimated premium was $37,600.       The Pimentals then began a pattern\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fof deception with Wausau Insurance similar to that employed with\n\nHartford Insurance. Arthur told auditors for Wausau Insurance that\n\nA.P.S. Products did concrete rebar construction rather than the\n\nsteel    erection,    welding,           or    decking   work    that    it   actually\n\nperformed.       Loretta, in turn, initially provided Wausau Insurance\n\nwith incomplete records that significantly underrepresented the\n\ncompany's payroll.\n\n            As     part    of       a   block    transfer   of    policies,       MWCRIB\n\nreassigned the Pimentals' insurance coverage from Wausau Insurance\n\nto     Savers    Property       &       Casualty     Insurance   Company      (\"Savers\n\nInsurance\") in October of 1997.                 Using the 1996 MWCRIB application\n\nas well as Wausau's most recent policy, Savers Insurance initially\n\ncalculated a $33,671 yearly premium based on a $65,000 payroll in\n\nconcrete rebar.           Once again, the Pimentals misrepresented the\n\nnature of their business to Savers Insurance. Arthur Pimental told\n\na loss-control inspector for Savers Insurance that his company only\n\nworked on concrete rebar. Further, the Pimentals failed to respond\n\nto several inquiries from Savers Insurance auditors, resulting in\n\nSavers Insurance using a 50% increased payroll figure of $97,500\n\nfor the 1997-to-1998 coverage period. This was still substantially\n\nsmaller than the actual payroll figure of $168,162.\n\n             In total, from October 1993 to August 1998, the Pimentals\n\npaid    their    employees      approximately         $738,000   in     salary.      The\n\ninsurance premiums they paid during this period were based on a\n\n\n                                              -12-\n\fpayroll   of   less   than    half   that   amount   --   about   $340,000.\n\nThroughout the time period, the Pimentals paid premium rates for\n\nconcrete rebar even though their work consisted almost entirely of\n\nsteel erection, welding, and decking.         Because different premium\n\nrates apply to each of these three activities and there was little\n\nevidence concerning how many employee hours were dedicated to each\n\nseparate activity, the extent of the monetary benefit the Pimentals\n\nreceived from misrepresenting their business is unclear.2            A jury\n\ncould easily infer that the premiums would have been higher if\n\nPimental had been honest in what he told his insurers.\n\n                        II.    Procedural History\n\n           On September 29, 1999, Arthur and Loretta Pimental were\n\neach indicted on one conspiracy count, 18 U.S.C. § 371, and\n\nfourteen counts of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1341.          Before trial, the\n\nPimentals moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the\n\ngovernment had violated Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) when it disclosed,\n\nafter earlier receiving permission from another judge on the court\n\nto do so, grand jury materials to an investigator for the Insurance\n\nFraud Bureau of Massachusetts.         Pimental, 236 F. Supp. 2d at 103.\n\nIn a trio of pretrial opinions, the district court held that there\n\nhad been a Rule 6(e) violation (despite the prior approval of a\n\n\n\n     2\n      Indeed, Pimental stresses on appeal that it is possible that\nhe actually lost money from misrepresenting the type of operations\nhis company    performed, because some of those operations were\ncheaper to insure than was concrete rebar.\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdifferent judge of the court), but held that the violation was\n\nharmless because the grand jury testimony that resulted from the\n\ntransmittal of information to the IFB investigator was not crucial\n\nto the grand jury's decision to indict.

Mass. 2001).\n\n             The government voluntarily dismissed three of the mail\n\nfraud counts on September 16, 2002, and the case proceeded to trial\n\nthe next day.    Pimental, 236 F. Supp. 2d at 104.      After six days of\n\ntestimony, a jury acquitted Loretta Pimental on all counts and\n\nacquitted Arthur Pimental on the conspiracy count and nine of the\n\neleven mail fraud counts.        The two mail fraud counts on which the\n\njury convicted Arthur Pimental were both based on mailings sent by\n\nloss-control inspectors.         The first count was premised on the\n\nOctober 5, 1994 mailing from William Brooks to Hartford Insurance,\n\nin   which   Brooks   reported   that   Arthur   Pimental   had   said   that\n\nPimental Steel Erectors only performed concrete rebar work.               The\n\nsecond count was based on the letter from Timothy Bergeron to\n\nArthur Pimental summarizing their meeting and noting that Pimental\n\nSteel was, according to Pimental, involved only in concrete rebar\n\nwork.\n\n             After the jury returned its verdict, Arthur Pimental\n\nmoved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fCriminal Procedure 29(c).              He also renewed his motion for a\n\ndismissal of the indictment, arguing that evidence presented at\n\ntrial provided a previously unavailable basis for believing that\n\nthe information disclosed to the IFB investigator had substantially\n\ninfluenced the grand jury's decision to indict.\n\n             The    district      court    held   that   there      was     sufficient\n\nevidence for the jury to find the existence of a scheme to defraud\n\nand that the mailings were reasonably foreseeable.                        Id. at 109,\n\n110.   But it nonetheless granted Pimental's Rule 29 motion because\n\nit concluded that there was not sufficient evidence that either\n\nmailing was in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme.                      Id.    It also\n\ndeclined to rule on Pimental's renewed motion for dismissal of the\n\nindictment based on the Rule 6(e) violation, finding that this\n\nissue was mooted by its grant of the Rule 29 motion.                      Id. at 112.\n\n             The government appeals the district court's grant of the\n\nRule 29 motion. Arthur Pimental, in turn, cross-appeals the denial\n\nof   his   motion    to    dismiss    the    indictment       for   the     Rule       6(e)\n\nviolation.\n\n                           III.    The Rule 29 Motion\n\n            Our review of the district court's Rule 29 determinations\n\nis de novo.        United States v. Moran, 312 F.3d 480, 487 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).     A judgment of acquittal should only be granted when the\n\nevidence and       all    reasonable      inferences     to   be    drawn       from    the\n\nevidence, both taken in the light most favorable to the government,\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fare insufficient for a rational factfinder to conclude that the\n\nprosecution has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, each of the\n\nelements of the offense.   Id.; United States v. Campbell, 268 F.3d\n\n1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001).   \"Under this formulation, a court considers\n\nall the evidence, direct and circumstantial, and resolves all\n\nevidentiary conflicts in favor of the verdict.\" Moran, 312 F.3d at\n\n487.\n\n          To demonstrate a violation of the mail fraud statute, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1341, the prosecution must prove \"(1) the devising or\n\nattempting to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) the\n\nknowing and willing participation in the scheme with the specific\n\nintent to defraud; and (3) the use of the mails in furtherance of\n\nthe scheme.\"   United States v. McCann, 366 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (quoting United States v. Montminy, 936 F.2d 626, 627 (1st\n\nCir. 1991)).   The government must also demonstrate, in order to\n\nprove causation, that the defendant knew, or could have reasonably\n\nforeseen, that \"the use of the mails [would] follow in the ordinary\n\ncourse of business.\"    Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 9\n\n(1954); cf. United States v. Fermin Castillo, 829 F.2d 1194, 1198-\n\n99 (1st Cir. 1987) (interpreting wire fraud statute).   \"It is not\n\nnecessary to prove that the defendant personally executed the\n\nmailings, but merely that the defendant 'caused the mailing by\n\ndoing some act from which it is reasonably foreseeable that the\n\nmails will be used.'\"   United States v. Bruckman, 874 F.2d 57, 60\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f(1st Cir. 1989) (quoting United States v. Gonzalez-Sanchez, 825\n\nF.2d 572, 588 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\n          There was easily sufficient evidence for the jury to find\n\nthe existence of a scheme to defraud and that the use of the mails\n\nwas reasonably foreseeable, as discussed below.     As to the \"in\n\nfurtherance of\" requirement, the district court erred in holding\n\nthat there was not sufficient evidence for the jury to find that\n\nthe two loss-control inspectors' mailings were in furtherance of\n\nthe fraudulent scheme.    Accordingly, we reverse the grant of the\n\nRule 29 motion and reinstate the convictions.\n\nA.   The Existence of a Scheme to Defraud\n\n          Pimental challenges the district court's conclusion that\n\nthere was sufficient evidence of a scheme to defraud, hoping to\n\nknock out the convictions on grounds other than those relied upon\n\nby the district court.3    First, he argues that the evidence at\n\ntrial did not establish that Pimental Steel's employees were\n\n\n\n     3\n      As recounted in Part I, there was significant evidence that,\nin addition to lying about the nature of Pimental Steel's\noperations, Pimental also lied about the size of the company's\npayroll. Pimental says that this evidence \"only established that\nin workers' compensation insurance applications, [he] made\nestimates of the payroll, which often vary widely from the actual\npayroll, particularly in the construction industry.\"       Not so.\nThere was more than sufficient evidence for the jury to find that\nPimental did indeed misrepresent the size of Pimental Steel's\npayroll in an effort to defraud the insurance companies.\nNonetheless, in order to simplify the analysis of whether Count\nFour was in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, see infra Part\nIII.B.ii., we focus on Pimental's misrepresentations concerning the\nnature of Pimental Steel's operations.\n\n                               -17-\n\factually covered by workers' compensation insurance when they were\n\nperforming steel erection.      Pimental says the jury had no way of\n\neliminating the possibility that if he had submitted a claim on\n\nbehalf of an injured employee, the insurance company would have\n\ndiscovered the incorrect premium payments and thus refused to pay\n\nthe employee.      Pimental does not contest the district court's\n\nconclusion that, as a matter of Massachusetts law, the insurance\n\ncompany would be obliged to cover Pimental Steel's employees under\n\nsuch circumstances.4    Pimental, 236 F. Supp. 2d at 106 (relying on\n\nEmployers Mutual Liability Insurance Co. of Wisconsin v. Merrimac\n\nMills Co., 325 Mass. 676, 681 (1950)).     But he says that there was\n\nno evidentiary basis for the jury to reach this conclusion.     From\n\nthis premise, Pimental argues that the jury could not have found\n\nthat the insurers suffered any loss as a result of Pimental's\n\nactions.      And that, concludes Pimental, means that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that there existed\n\na \"scheme to defraud.\"\n\n             Pimental's argument goes too far.    In order to find a\n\n\"scheme to defraud,\" the jury simply had to determine that Pimental\n\nwas attempting to \"wrong[] one in his property rights by dishonest\n\nmethods or schemes.\"     McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 358\n\n(1987) (quoting Hammerschmidt v. United States, 265 U.S. 182, 188\n\n(1924)).     Here, there was more than sufficient evidence for the\n\n\n     4\n         As Pimental does not raise this issue, we do not address it.\n\n                                  -18-\n\fjury to conclude that Pimental lied about the nature of his\n\ncompany's work in order to pay cheaper premiums on his workers'\n\ncompensation insurance.    The jury easily could have concluded that\n\nPimental was attempting to dishonestly minimize the insurance\n\npremiums to the company that he should have been paying under\n\nMassachusetts law. The speculative possibility that if an employee\n\nhad filed a claim with Hartford Insurance, it would have discovered\n\nPimental's lies and refused to pay the employee is irrelevant.      To\n\nconvict, the jury need not have drawn any additional conclusion.\n\n          Pimental also argues that there was insufficient evidence\n\nof a scheme to defraud because the evidence was inconclusive as to\n\nwhether he ultimately paid premiums that were less than what he\n\nactually owed, for the reasons discussed earlier.       But whether\n\nPimental actually paid more or less in premiums than he actually\n\nowed goes only to the success of his fraudulent scheme, not to its\n\nexistence.     See United States v. Martin, 228 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (success in scheme is not needed to support mail fraud\n\nconviction).    In addition, the argument fails on its own terms.   A\n\nrational jury could have found that Pimental, because of his own\n\nactions, did not in fact have the option of making variable premium\n\npayments according to the amount of time that his workers spent\n\nperforming different job tasks.    The evidence at trial established\n\nonly that:\n\n     The payroll of an individual employee may be divided and\n     allocated to more than one classification, provided the\n\n                                 -19-\n\f     entries in the original records of the insured disclose\n     an allocation of each such individual employee's payroll.\n     Any such operation for which separate payroll records are\n     not maintained shall be assigned to the highest rated\n     classification which applies to the job or location where\n     the operation is performed.\n\n(emphasis added). There was extensive testimony that the Pimentals\n\nspecifically chose not to keep records documenting the breakdown of\n\ntheir employees' work and that they repeatedly misled the insurance\n\ncompany concerning their payroll in order to pay lower rates.      A\n\nreasonable jury could have easily found that the Pimentals did not\n\nmaintain \"separate payroll records\" and hence that the rate they\n\nshould have paid, for all payroll hours, was the rate for steel\n\nerection.   This would have been significantly more than the amount\n\nthey actually paid.\n\nB.   The \"In Furtherance Of\" Requirement\n\n            In order for a mailing to be \"in furtherance\" of a\n\nfraudulent scheme, it \"must be for the purpose of executing the\n\nscheme,\" United States v. Maze, 414 U.S. 395, 399-400 (1974)\n\n(quoting Kann v. United States, 323 U.S. 88, 94 (1944)), or \"part\n\nof the execution of the scheme as conceived by the perpetrator at\n\nthe time,\" Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705, 715 (1989).   The\n\nmailing \"need not be an essential element of the scheme\"; it can be\n\nmerely \"incident to an essential part of the scheme,\" id. at 710-11\n\n(quoting Pereira, 347 U.S. at 8), or \"a step in [the] plot,\" id. at\n\n711 (quoting Badders v. United States, 240 U.S. 391, 394 (1916));\n\nsee also McCann, 366 F.3d at 52.\n\n                               -20-\n\f(i)   Count Two Conviction -- Brooks's Account Data Report\n\n           The mailing that formed the basis of Count Two, on which\n\nthe jury convicted Pimental, was Brooks's October 5, 1994 \"Account\n\nData Report\" to Hartford Insurance, which recounted the substance\n\nof his loss-control interview with Pimental.             In that report,\n\nBrooks wrote that Pimental had said that his business involved only\n\nrebar construction.\n\n             In   Schmuck,   the   Supreme   Court    addressed   the   \"in\n\nfurtherance of\" requirement with respect to a mailing of some\n\nsimilarity to Brooks's loss-control report.             The defendant in\n\nSchmuck purchased used cars, rolled back their odometers, and then\n\nresold them to retail dealerships, who, in turn, sold them to\n\nconsumers.    489 U.S. at 707.     The Court held that the mailing of a\n\ntitle-application form from the dealership that purchased Schmuck's\n\nvehicle to a state agency, at the time of the dealership's sale of\n\nthe car to the end-consumer, met the \"in furtherance of\" element of\n\nthe mail fraud statute.        Id. at 710-12.        In cases of \"ongoing\n\nfraudulent venture[s],\" reasoned the Court, mailings that help\n\nmaintain a harmonious relationship between the perpetrator and the\n\nvictim further the fraudulent scheme by helping to ensure its\n\ncontinued success in the future.       Id. at 711-12.    Even though such\n\nmailings were not absolutely necessary for the scheme to succeed in\n\nthe short term, they allowed the dealerships who purchased the cars\n\nfrom Schmuck to sell them to the ultimate consumer and thus helped\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fguarantee that the dealerships would continue to purchase cars from\n\nSchmuck in the future.    Id.\n\n          Likewise, the mailing from Brooks to Hartford Insurance\n\nhelped Pimental maintain his ongoing fraudulent venture by ensuring\n\nthat he continued to receive insurance coverage.            The jury was\n\nentitled to conclude that had Brooks never mailed his loss-control\n\nreport, Hartford Insurance would have terminated its insurance\n\ncoverage and Pimental's scheme would have, at least temporarily,\n\ncome to a halt.    Indeed, Pimental's policy with Hartford Insurance\n\nwas threatened with cancellation when he attempted to avoid a loss-\n\ncontrol interview in the summer of 1995 by ignoring repeated\n\ninquiries from Bergeron. If Hartford Insurance were not to receive\n\na   completed    loss-control   report,   Bergeron's   letter        warned,\n\nPimental's   insurance   coverage   would   be   \"subject    .   .    .   to\n\ncancellation.\"    A rational jury could have readily found that the\n\nloss-control report from Brooks to Hartford Insurance furthered\n\nPimental's fraudulent scheme because it was a necessary step in the\n\ncontinued relationship between Pimental and his victim, Hartford\n\nInsurance.   Cf. United States v. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 64-65 (1st\n\nCir. 1998) (in ongoing scheme in which lobbyist made illegal\n\npurchases for a public official, the mailing of a credit card bill\n\nto the lobbyist satisfied the \"in furtherance of\" requirement\n\nbecause if the lobbyist \"did not pay [the] bills, his credit line\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fwould have been terminated and the gratuities could not have\n\ncontinued\").\n\n          The district court reached the opposite conclusion by\n\nrelying on a statement in a post-Schmuck First Circuit case, United\n\nStates v. Pacheco-Ortiz, 889 F.2d 301, 305 (1st Cir. 1989), that\n\nthe perpetration of the fraud or its subsequent cover-up must have\n\n\"depended in some way on\" the mailing.   Pimental, 236 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 108.   The court interpreted this formulation to impose a \"but\n\nfor\" test for the \"in furtherance of\" element of mail fraud -- i.e.\n\nthat a fraudulent scheme \"depends on\" a mailing only when but for\n\nthat mailing, the scheme could not have succeeded or would have\n\nbeen discovered.5   The district court concluded that Pacheco-\n\nOrtiz's use of \"depends on\" meant \"but-for\" despite language in\n\nPacheco-Ortiz that also said that it was not necessary that each\n\nmailing guarantee the success of the scheme or even significantly\n\nadvance it -- that it only need be closely related to the scheme.\n\n889 F.2d at 305.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      The flexibility of the English language is one of its\nwonders; that flexibility can lead to misunderstandings. Pacheco-\nOrtiz simply said that \"for the mailings to be considered in\nfurtherance of the scheme, the scheme's completion or the\nprevention of its detection must have depended in some way on the\nmailings.\" 889 F.3d at 305 (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis\nadded). It did not say there was a \"but-for\" requirement. The\ndictionary does say that the word \"depend\" can mean that something\nis \"a necessary condition,\" but the word can also mean \"to have a\nconnection or relationship as a subordinate part or appurtenance.\"\nWebster's Third New International Dictionary 604 (1993).\n\n                               -23-\n\f          Applying its approach, the district court found that\n\nthere was no evidence that, absent the mailing of the loss-control\n\nreport, Hartford would necessarily have uncovered the scheme and\n\nterminated Pimental's coverage.   Although the court noted that it\n\nwas possible that a loss-control report describing the Pimentals'\n\nbusiness as steel erection \"might have raised an eyebrow\" at the\n\ninsurance company, it concluded that the government did not present\n\nsufficient evidence on this point; the evidence did not demonstrate\n\nthat \"the jig would have been up\" had Brooks's loss-control report\n\nstated that the Pimentals' business was steel erection.   Id.\n\n          The district court's search for a direct, but-for, link\n\nbetween Brooks's mailing and the fraudulent element of Pimental's\n\nscheme -- the claim that his business involved concrete rebar and\n\nnot steel erection --   misapprehended the law in two ways.   First,\n\na mail fraud conviction does not require the existence of a \"but-\n\nfor\" link between the mailing and the fraud, or its cover-up.   Such\n\na rule would harken back to the oft-rejected notion that the\n\nmailing needs to be connected with the essence of the fraud.      It\n\nneed not be, so long as it is \"incident to an essential element of\n\nthe fraud.\"   See Schmuck at 710-11.     For instance, in Schmuck\n\nitself there was no but-for relationship between the success of the\n\nscheme and the mailing of the title-application form.         Schmuck\n\ncould have continued selling cars that had been tampered with even\n\nif the dealerships that bought those cars did not mail the title-\n\n\n                                -24-\n\fapplication forms.    The mailings were nonetheless \"in furtherance\"\n\nof the scheme because they contributed to its overall success by\n\nmaking it more likely that dealerships would come back to Schmuck\n\nto purchase more cars.\n\n          Similarly,    mailings   that   are   designed   to   \"lull   the\n\nvictims into a false sense of security, postpone their ultimate\n\ncomplaint to the authorities, and therefore make the apprehension\n\nof the defendant[] less likely than if no mailings had taken place\"\n\nare sufficient under the statute.     United States v. Lane, 474 U.S.\n\n438, 451-52 (1986) (quoting Maze, 414 U.S. at 403) (emphasis\n\nadded); United States v. Lopez, 71 F.3d 954, 961-62 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).   Preventing the detection of an ongoing or a completed\n\nfraudulent scheme is not contingent on lulling the victim into a\n\nfalse sense of security.    Instead, lulling the victim into a false\n\nsense of security contributes to the prevention of the scheme's\n\ndetection by making detection of the scheme less likely.          This is\n\nsufficient to satisfy the \"in furtherance of\" requirement of the\n\nmail fraud statute.    See, e.g., McCann, 366 F.3d at 53 (letter sent\n\nafter the culmination of the fraud was in furtherance of fraud\n\nbecause it \"served the important purpose of decreasing the risk of\n\ndetection\"); Lopez, 71 F.3d at 956-57, 961 (fax sent two years\n\nafter culmination of fraud that attempted to explain certain\n\ndocuments that were submitted to cover-up the illegal withdrawal\n\nwas in furtherance of fraudulent scheme in wire fraud conviction\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fbecause it made defendant's apprehension less likely); United\n\nStates v. Young, 955 F.2d 99, 108 (1st Cir. 1992) (Breyer, J.)\n\n(mailings that misrepresented disposition of embezzled funds helped\n\nconceal    the    fraud    and    were   thus   sufficient    to    meet   the   \"in\n\nfurtherance of\" requirement).\n\n            A second, independent, problem with the district court's\n\nanalysis     is     that     it     focused     exclusively        on   Pimental's\n\nmisrepresentations in determining whether the mailings furthered\n\nhis overall scheme.           In fact, even under the district court's\n\noverly stringent and incorrect but-for test, the jury would have\n\nbeen entitled to conclude that Pimental's scheme depended on\n\nBrooks's mailing.         The reason is that the success of the scheme did\n\nnot simply depend on Pimental lying about the nature of his\n\nbusiness's operations -- it also depended, among other things, on\n\nthe mailing and processing of loss-control reports.                     Were those\n\nreports not mailed, there was significant evidence that Hartford\n\nInsurance would have cancelled the Pimentals' coverage. One of the\n\ncentral points of Schmuck is that a mailing that is itself innocent\n\nand that seems to accomplish an innocent end can nonetheless be in\n\nfurtherance of a fraudulent scheme.\n\n            ii.     Count Four Conviction -- Bergeron's Mailing to\n                    Pimental\n\n            The second Count on which Pimental was convicted is\n\npremised on Bergeron's mailing to Pimental himself of a summary of\n\nthe loss-control interview.              In this mailing, Bergeron states,\n\n                                         -26-\n\fbased on what Pimental said in the interview, that Pimental's\n\nbusiness continued to be the installation of concrete reinforcement\n\nbar.\n\n            Pimental argues that whether he received a summary of his\n\nmeeting with Bergeron was immaterial to whether Hartford Insurance\n\nwould continue to provide the Pimentals with insurance for their\n\nemployees at the incorrect rate.         Pimental also argues that lying\n\nto loss-control inspectors as opposed to lying to auditors was not\n\nan essential part of the scheme.             This was particularly so, says\n\nPimental, because the evidence was that the loss-control division\n\nof Hartford Insurance was entirely separate from the division that\n\nset premiums and investigated fraud.            Indeed, Brooks was not even\n\nan employee of Hartford Insurance, but was instead an independent\n\ncontractor.\n\n            A   reasonable   jury   easily      could   have   concluded    that\n\nPimental needed to be or thought he needed to be consistent in his\n\nlies to representatives of the insurer, regardless of who the\n\nrepresentative was.     It is not hard to infer that an inconsistent\n\nreport from a loss-control inspector could somehow trigger alarms\n\nin the premium setting group.         The harder question is why a letter\n\nto     Pimental,   recounting   his     fraudulent      statements,   was    in\n\nfurtherance of the fraud.       There are several responses.           One is\n\nthat Pimental now knew that his deception of the inspector was\n\nsuccessful -- his copy showed that his lies were being sent to the\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fcompany records.          This could only encourage him in the scheme.\n\nFurther, there was an obvious purpose to Bergeron sending a summary\n\nof his report to Pimental -- it allowed Pimental to correct any\n\ninaccurate information on the report.                      Pimental chose not to\n\ncorrect    the    misinformation,            thus    perpetuating      the   fraud    and\n\ndemonstrating further his fraudulent intent.                    See United States v.\n\nMorrow, 39 F.3d 1228, 1236-37 (1st Cir. 1994) (in insurance fraud\n\nscheme,     the    insurance           company's      mailing     to     the    insured\n\nacknowledging that it had received the fraudulent claim was, under\n\nthe Schmuck formulation, \"'incidental' to an essential element in\n\nthe scheme\").\n\nC.   Causation: Were the Mailings Reasonably Foreseeable?\n\n            Pimental argues that there was insufficient evidence for\n\nthe jury to conclude that he \"caused\" either of the mailings at\n\nissue because neither of them was reasonably foreseeable.                             See\n\nPereira, 347 U.S. at 8-9.                  There was no evidence, according to\n\nPimental,    of    a    \"course       of   business\"    between     himself    and    his\n\ninsurers    that       would    have       led   a   reasonable     person     to    have\n\nanticipated either of the mailings that formed the basis for his\n\nconvictions.       He points to evidence that Brooks could not recall\n\never telling Pimental that the loss-control report would be mailed\n\nto Hartford Insurance.              Similarly, Bergeron testified only that he\n\ntold Pimental          that    he    would   send    the   loss-control      report    to\n\nHartford, not that he would send it to Pimental himself.                        All of\n\n\n                                             -28-\n\fthis, concludes Pimental, means there was no way that he could\n\nreasonably foresee that either Brooks's or Bergeron's letters would\n\never be written or mailed.\n\n          Pimental's   arguments   are   premised   on   an   incorrect\n\nunderstanding of the law. As the district court correctly held, it\n\nis simply the \"use of the mails\" in the course of the scheme rather\n\nthan the particular mailing at issue that must be reasonably\n\nforeseeable for the causation element of a mail fraud offense to be\n\nsatisfied.6   See Morrow, 39 F.3d at 1237 (all that is required to\n\nshow causation is that the defendant \"participated in a crime in\n\nwhich it was foreseeable . . . that the mails would be used\" and\n\nthat was satisfied where defendant \"admitted at trial that he knew\n\nthat automobile insurance claims are processed in part through the\n\n\n\n     6\n      The facts of Bruckman clearly illustrate this principle. The\ndefendant in that case submitted a fraudulent financial statement\nto a bankruptcy court in connection with the attempted purchase of\na corporation under that court's protection. 874 F.2d at 59-60.\nThe bankruptcy court's subsequent mailings of the statement to the\ncorporation's creditors formed the basis for the defendant's\nconvictions. Id. at 60. In responding to Bruckman's causation\nargument, the court held that it was not necessary for the\nbankruptcy court's mailings to the company's creditors to have been\nreasonably foreseeable. Rather, it was sufficient that there \"was\nample evidence from which the jury could conclude both that\nBruckman participated in the scheme to defraud, and that some use\nof the mails was to be anticipated in the course of such scheme.\"\nId. (emphasis added). Because the \"jury could reasonably infer\nthat mailings would be foreseeable in the course of the bankruptcy\nreorganization proceedings related to the intended acquisition of\n[the corporation] by Bruckman and others,\" there was sufficient\nevidence for the jury to conclude \"that Bruckman knowingly caused\nthe mailings\" at issue. Id.\n\n\n                               -29-\n\fuse of the mails\"); Bruckman, 874 F.2d at 60 (\"[T]he causation\n\nelement is met as long as some use of the mails was reasonably to\n\nbe anticipated in the course of the scheme.\"); Fermin-Castillo, 829\n\nF.2d at 1198 (\"As long as some use of the instrumentality in the\n\ncourse of the endeavor was reasonably to be anticipated, the\n\ncausation   requirement   is   met.\");   see   also   United   States   v.\n\nBortnovsky, 879 F.2d 30, 38-39 (2d Cir. 1989) (noting that the\n\ncausation element of mail fraud \"has been so liberally construed as\n\nto suggest that it requires only that the use of the mail itself,\n\nrather than a particular mailing, be reasonably foreseeable\" and\n\nendorsing that view).\n\n            The principle that it is the use of the mails (rather\n\nthan the specific mailing that is charged) that must be reasonably\n\nforeseeable as a result of the scheme is affirmed by one of the\n\nprimary cases upon which Pimental relies.7        In United States v.\n\n\n     7\n      Pimental also relies on United States v. Smith, 934 F.2d 270\n(11th Cir. 1991), which is indeed in tension with our analysis.\nThat case involved an insurance fraud in which the defendant faked\nan injury from a staged automobile accident.     Id. at 271. The\ndefendant received a claims draft, which is similar to a check, in\nperson from the insurance agent, but a copy of the draft was sent\nto the insurance company.    Id. The court found that there was\ninsufficient evidence that the use of the mails was reasonably\nforeseeable because it was not common knowledge that insurance\ncompanies mail accounting copies of drafts. See id. at 273. In so\nholding, the court agreed \"that it is foreseeable that\ncommunications involving the policy, the details of the claim, or\nrequests for the payment of the claim would be mailed.\" Id. But\nthe court found this to be irrelevant because \"the substantive\ncounts of [the defendant's] indictment did not allege such\nmailings.\" Id.\n     To the extent that Smith is inconsistent with our analysis, we\n\n                                 -30-\n\fWalters, 997 F.2d 1219 (7th Cir. 1993), the court held that there\n\nwas insufficient evidence on the causation element of a mail fraud\n\noffense    because   the   evidence   did   not   establish   \"that   [the\n\ndefendant] conceived a scheme in which mailings played a role.\"\n\nId. at 1222.   Rather than focus on the predictability of specific\n\nmailings in the indictment, the Walters court thus premised its\n\nanalysis on the question of whether the use of the mails, as a\n\ngeneral matter, was a foreseeable component of the scheme to\n\ndefraud.     See id. at 1223-24.       Indeed, in the course of its\n\nanalysis, the court noted that insurance fraud is the \"paradigm\"\n\ncase in which the use of the mails is reasonably foreseeable\n\nbecause the payment and submission of insurance claims typically\n\ninvolves mailings between the insurance company's agents and the\n\ninsured.    See id. at 1223.    So here.\n\n                     IV.   Pimental's Cross-Appeal\n\n           During its preliminary investigations in this case, the\n\nU.S. Attorney's office filed an ex parte motion with the district\n\ncourt seeking permission, on the basis of the exception to grand\n\njury secrecy, to disclose grand jury materials to investigators and\n\nanalysts of the IFB. The exception allows disclosure of grand jury\n\nmaterials to \"any government personnel -- including those of a\n\nstate or state subdivision\" when such disclosure is necessary to\n\nprosecute a criminal case.      Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(A)(ii).       The\n\n\nreject its approach.\n\n                                  -31-\n\fdistrict court motion judge, who was not the trial judge, granted\n\nthe    motion    without    opinion.      No    disclosure       was    made    by   the\n\nprosecutor without court permission.\n\n              Subsequently, during pretrial discovery, Pimental moved\n\nto dismiss the indictment, arguing that the government had violated\n\nRule 6(e) when it disclosed to Scott Faragi, an IFB investigator\n\nwho later testified before the grand jury, Pimental's bank records\n\nand other material that had been obtained through the grand jury's\n\nsubpoena powers.        Pimental argued that IFB agents such as Faragi\n\nwere    not     \"government    personnel\"       within    the    meaning       of    Rule\n\n6(e)(3)(A)(ii), and thus the exception to grand jury secrecy was\n\nnot applicable and the earlier district court order was wrong.\n\n              In response, the trial court held that IFB investigators\n\ncan not be \"government personnel\" within the meaning of Rule 6(e),\n\nand thus      that    the   earlier    ruling    allowing       the    prosecutor      to\n\ndisclose grand jury materials to IFB investigators was in error.\n\nPimental, 199 F.R.D. at 33-37 (D. Mass. 2001); Pimental, 201 F.R.D.\n\nat 25-26.       It did not hold that because the disclosure had been\n\nauthorized by the court, there could be no dismissal of the\n\nindictment.          Rather,   the    district    court     refused      to    dismiss\n\nPimental's indictment because the \"error\" did not substantially\n\naffect the grand jury's decision to indict, and thus it was\n\nharmless.       Pimental, 204 F.R.D. at 227-28.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\f           Pimental now challenges this pre-trial denial of his\n\nmotion to dismiss the indictment.       He also asks this court to\n\nconsider his post-trial renewal of that motion, which the district\n\ncourt found to be moot due to its grant of Pimental's Rule 29\n\nmotion.\n\n           We conclude that the first district court's implicit\n\nconclusion that IFB agents are \"government personnel -- including\n\nthose of a state or state subdivision\" within the meaning of Rule\n\n6(e)(3)(A)(ii) was, on these facts, not error.    We do not hold that\n\nall IFB employees, regardless of the circumstances, are government\n\npersonnel, but only that here that decision was correct.       We thus\n\naffirm on alternate grounds the denial of Pimental's motion to\n\ndismiss the indictment, which disposes of his post-trial renewal of\n\nthe motion.8   See Bonano v. E. Caribbean Airline Corp., 365 F.3d\n\n81, 86 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"We are not confined to the lower court's\n\nrationale, but may affirm a judgment on any independent ground made\n\nmanifest by the record.\").\n\n(A)   Grand Jury Secrecy and the Limited Exception for Government\n      Personnel.\n\n           Federal grand juries are responsible for investigating\n\ncriminal   allegations   while   simultaneously   shielding   innocent\n\ncitizens from unfounded accusations of criminal conduct.           See\n\n\n\n      8\n      The government assumed arguendo for purposes of this appeal\nthat Rule 6(e) was violated. We think it better to address the\nissue directly.\n\n                                 -33-\n\fBranzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 686-87 & n.23 (1972).                        These\n\nsometimes competing roles \"underlie[] the 'long-established policy\n\nthat maintains the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings in the\n\nfederal courts.'\"        United States v. Sells Eng'g, Inc., 463 U.S.\n\n418, 424 (1983) (quoting United States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 356\n\nU.S.   677,    681    (1958)).         Grand    jury    secrecy   facilitates    the\n\ninvestigation of criminal charges by assuring potential witnesses\n\nthat   their    testimony       will    not    become    public   knowledge,    thus\n\nencouraging them to testify freely and limiting the potential that\n\nthey will be improperly influenced by those under investigation.\n\nSee id.   At the same time, it ensures \"that persons who are accused\n\nbut exonerated by the grand jury will not be held up to public\n\nridicule.\" Id. (quoting Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest,\n\n441 U.S. 211, 219 (1979)).\n\n              The    specific    dimensions      of     the   grand   jury   secrecy\n\nrequirements are codified in Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e).                      That Rule\n\nprohibits certain people -- including grand jurors, interpreters,\n\nand, of particular relevance here, \"attorney[s] for the government\"\n\n-- from disclosing \"a matter occurring before the grand jury.\"\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)(b).                  Rule 6(e) also contains certain\n\nexceptions to the general secrecy requirement. The first pertinent\n\nexception at issue in this case, under subpart (3)(A)(ii), allows\n\n\"[d]isclosure of a grand-jury matter\" to \"any government personnel\n\n-- including those of a state or state subdivision or of an Indian\n\n\n                                         -34-\n\ftribe -- that an attorney for the government considers necessary to\n\nassist in performing that attorney's duty to enforce federal\n\ncriminal law.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(A)(ii). The second, under\n\n6(e)(3)(E), empowers a district court to authorize disclosure in\n\ncertain situations. We think it implicit that a district court may\n\nalso act in a motion to authorize disclosure under subpart 3(A).\n\n(B) The IFB and the \"Plain Meaning\" of \"Government Personnel.\"\n\n            The IFB is a \"quasi-governmental entity,\" In re Justices\n\nof the Superior Court, 218 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 2000), that\n\ninvestigates allegations of fraudulent insurance transactions.\n\nCommonwealth v. Ellis, 429 Mass. 362, 365 (1999). Its creation was\n\nauthorized by Massachusetts statute, St. 1996, c. 427, § 13,9 and\n\ncarried   out   by   two   voluntary   associations    of   Massachusetts\n\ninsurance carriers, the MWCRIB and the Automobile Insurance Bureau\n\n(AIB), which are themselves licensed under Massachusetts law.         See\n\nid. at 13; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175A § 8 (licensing AIB); Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 152 § 52C (licensing MWCRIB).         See generally Ellis, 429\n\nMass. at 365. The authorizing statute requires that the MWCRIB and\n\nAIB each fund half of the IFB's budget, § 13(c), and each provide\n\nthe IFB with five of its fifteen Board members, § 13(a).             The\n\nremaining    five    IFB   Board   members   are   Massachusetts   public\n\n\n     9\n      This Act is codified in the notes to Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266,\n§ 111B, rather than in the section itself. This confusing choice\nof codification has resulted in the incorrect referencing of the\nAct as codified as \"Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 427, § 11.\" See, e.g., In\nre Justices, 218 F.3d at 13.\n\n                                   -35-\n\fofficials.     § 13(a).       Under the statutory scheme, every insurer\n\n\"having    reason    to     believe   that     an   insurance   transaction     is\n\nfraudulent\" must advise the IFB of its suspicions.                 § 13(e).   The\n\nIFB, in turn, is required to review those cases and investigate\n\nfurther when necessary.           § 13(f).          Where the IFB's executive\n\ndirector     \"is    satisfied    that     a    material   fraud,    deceit,    or\n\nintentional misrepresentation has been committed in an insurance\n\ntransaction,\" he must \"refer the matter to the attorney general,\n\nthe appropriate district attorney or the United States attorney.\"\n\n§ 13(h) (emphasis added).\n\n            The trial court rejected the motion court's implicit\n\nholding, concluding that IFB employees can not be \"government\n\npersonnel,\" based primarily on a \"plain meaning\" reading of the\n\nterm.    Emphasizing that the IFB's funding comes entirely from two\n\nprivate associations of insurance companies and that the majority\n\nof its Board are not public officials, the court concluded that\n\n\"the IFB inhabits a region of the private/public spectrum that is\n\nmuch closer to a purely private agency.\"              See Pimental, 199 F.R.D.\n\nat 33.\n\n            As an initial matter, there may well be instances in\n\nwhich an entity (or at least some of its employees) is considered\n\ngovernmental for a particular purpose despite the fact that it is\n\nboth controlled       and    financed    by     private   individuals.        Even\n\nassuming that the IFB is completely controlled and financed by\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\fprivate insurance companies, that does not necessarily mean that\n\nits employees cannot be government personnel for purposes of Rule\n\n6(e).\n\n            Here, the district court's characterization of the IFB as\n\nentirely funded and controlled by private entities was incorrect.\n\nWhile it is true that the IFB's funding comes entirely from MWCRIB\n\nand AIB, two private associations of insurance companies, both of\n\nthose associations are required by Massachusetts law to provide\n\nthat funding.    See st. 1996, c. 427, § 13(c); see also Ellis, 429\n\nMass. at 373 n. 16.      This is not an instance in which private\n\nentities have voluntarily chosen to spend their resources on\n\ninvestigative personnel. Cf. United States v. Tager, 638 F.2d 167,\n\n168 (10th Cir. 1980) (where insurance companies voluntarily chose\n\nto fund an entity to investigate insurance fraud and completely\n\ncontrolled the scope of its actions, employees of the entity were\n\nnot     \"government   personnel\"    within   the   meaning   of   Rule\n\n6(e)(3)(A)(ii)).10    If anything, the IFB's funding is more akin to\n\n\n      10\n      In Tager, the government disclosed grand jury material to Mr.\nHouse, an employee of the Insurance Crime Prevention Institute\n(ICPI), an organization funded by insurance companies for the\npurpose of investigating possible frauds against them. 638 F.2d at\n168.   Unlike in this case, though, there was no doubt that\n\"[n]either the ICPI nor Mr. House was in any official position\nwhatsoever.\" Id. The opinion does not indicate that any statute\nexisted that established or authorized the ICPI, provided for its\nfunding or structure, or gave it special responsibilities or\nprivileges.    See id.      The court briefly noted that Rule\n6(e)(3)(A)(ii) did not apply because Mr. House was not \"government\npersonnel,\" and spent the bulk of the opinion considering an\nentirely separate exception to grand jury secrecy that is not at\n\n                                   -37-\n\fa state-mandated tax on insurance companies than a voluntary\n\nexpenditure by private entities.     Cf. Keller v. State Bar of Cal.,\n\n496 U.S. 1, 9-11 (the mandatory charging of dues by the California\n\nBar Association was state action that implicated First Amendment\n\nconcerns).    Indeed, the Supreme Judicial Court, the final arbiter\n\non   Massachusetts   law,   has   explicitly    found   that   \"insurance\n\ncompanies [cannot] control the [IFB] by withdrawing financial\n\nsupport\" even were they to attempt to forego the benefits of\n\nmembership in the MWCRIB and AIB.     If insurers withdrew from these\n\norganizations, \"the Legislature could easily amend the statute to\n\nbase assessments on premiums written or on some other standard.\"\n\nEllis, 429 Mass. at 373.\n\n          The trial court's analysis also underestimates the full\n\nextent of the control that the Commonwealth exercises over the IFB.\n\nAlthough only a third of the IFB's board members are public\n\nofficials, the IFB's purpose, organizational scheme, and basic\n\noperations are all dictated by statute.        And while the IFB's day-\n\nto-day administration within the framework is, in large part,\n\ncontrolled by individuals who are not public officials, it is also\n\nsubject to the constant oversight of the Massachusetts legislature,\n\nto which the IFB must submit a report every six months.         § 13(j).\n\n             In addition, the IFB was conceived of and authorized by\n\nstatute as part of a larger scheme to curb insurance fraud, a\n\n\nissue here.    See id. at 168-69.\n\n                                  -38-\n\fmatter of significant public concern, both at the state level, see\n\nEllis, 429 Mass. at 365, and nationally, see United States v. Hurn,\n\n368 F.3d 1359 (11th Cir. 2004) (affirming federal conviction for\n\nworkers' compensation fraud); United States v. Fore, 169 F.3d 104\n\n(2d Cir. 1999) (same).     The IFB was also given significant powers\n\nto achieve this goal, including access to various state records\n\nthat are not normally available to private entities and the right\n\nto review all   suspicions of fraud within the insurance companies.\n\nSee st. 1996, c. 427, §§ 13(d) & (e).    It also has the affirmative\n\nobligation to report suspicions of fraud when they are sufficiently\n\ncorroborated.   § 13(h).   Massachusetts chose to specify that those\n\nsuspicions may be reported to federal prosecutors.\n\n          The IFB straddles the line between a government and a\n\nprivate entity, having attributes of each.     As such, the text of\n\nthe Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) itself provides little guidance on whether\n\nIFB employees can be characterized as \"government personnel\" within\n\nthe meaning of the Rule.    Neither this Court nor any other federal\n\ncircuit court11 has previously addressed whether IFB employees, or\n\nsimilar quasi-state-government employees, fall within the term\n\n\"government personnel\" in Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii).12   Given the lack of\n\n\n     11\n      Several district court decisions have addressed the issue.\nSee, e.g., In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 158 F. Supp. 2d 96 (D.\nMass. 2001).\n     12\n      The district court saw things differently, saying that Tager,\n638 F.2d 167, involved a \"finding [that] the government violated\nRule    6(e)(3)(A)(ii)      under     circumstances     materially\n\n                                 -39-\n\feither a clear textual resolution or of controlling authority, we\n\nturn to the history of the Rule and its purpose in allowing\n\ndisclosure only to \"government personnel\" but not others.\n\n(C) History and Purpose of the Exception to Grand Jury Secrecy in\n    Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii).\n\n           Before 1977, Rule 6(e) did not permit the disclosure of\n\ngrand   jury     materials   to   government   employees   who   were   not\n\nattorneys.     Sells Eng'g, 463 U.S. at 436.      Over time, the lack of\n\nsuch a provision became \"something of a problem in practice,\n\nbecause Justice Department attorneys found that they often needed\n\nactive assistance from outside personnel -- not only investigators\n\nfrom the FBI, IRS, and other law enforcement agencies, but also\n\naccountants, handwriting experts, and other persons with special\n\nskills.\"   Id.    In response to this concern, the Advisory Committee\n\non Rules suggested amending Rule 6(e) to allow disclosure to non-\n\nattorney government personnel.          See id. at 436-37.        Although\n\nCongress heatedly debated the proposed amendment and initially\n\nvoted to disapprove it, concern focused principally on the prospect\n\nthat grand jury materials would be used to pursue civil, rather\n\nthan criminal, matters.       See id. at 437.    The principle of grand\n\njury secrecy would be severely compromised, the objection went, if\n\ngovernment agencies such as the IRS could indirectly use materials\n\n\nindistinguishable from those here.\" Pimental, 199 F.R.D. at 35.\nTager has very little to do with this case, where there is no\nimmediately obvious answer to the question of whether the person to\nwhom the disclosure was made was government personnel.\n\n                                    -40-\n\fcollected by the grand jury to help prosecute a civil case against\n\nan accused.   See id.   Most law-makers, it appears, agreed with the\n\nbasic principle that grand jury materials \"should be available to\n\n'every legitimate member of [the] team' conducting the criminal\n\ninvestigation.\" Id. at 439 (quoting the testimony of Acting Deputy\n\nAttorney General Richard Thornburgh, testifying before the House on\n\nbehalf of the Justice Department).\n\n          Precisely     who   was     a    \"legitimate   member\" of the\n\nprosecution team was also a subject of some discussion:\n\n     [Rep. James Mann:] Along the same line, the rule seems to\n     restrict to other Government personnel the experts -- and\n     I will use that term loosely -- that the attorney for the\n     Government may call upon.        We have a pretty big\n     Government with a lot of experts, but on certain matters\n     there may not be a governmental employee who is expert in\n     that field.    Is it your intention not to permit the\n     prosecutor to call in an astrologer or astronomer, for\n     example?\n\n     Professor LaFave [Reporter, Advisory Committee on\n     Criminal Rules]: Yes; that is correct.         Apparently\n     representatives of the Justice department whom we talked\n     to about this particular problem did not seem to think\n     that was a problem, in other words, that there was an\n     occasion when they would need an expert and couldn't find\n     the astrologer some place in the Federal Government.\n\nProposed Amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure:\n\nHearing Before the House Subcomm. on Criminal Justice of the House\n\nComm. on the Judiciary, 95th Cong. 92 (Feb. 24, 1977).       The Rule's\n\nlimitation of disclosure to \"government personnel\" thus reflected\n\nthe basic belief that any needed expertise on a particular criminal\n\n\n\n\n                                    -41-\n\fmatter    could    be    found      within    the    confines    of    the    federal\n\ngovernment.\n\n              As it turned out, federal prosecutors could not always\n\nfind the necessary expertise within the federal government to\n\nprosecute      a   case.      In     some     instances,     federal     prosecutors\n\ntemporarily hired outside experts to assist in the prosecution of\n\na case.       Recognizing the import of sharing grand jury materials\n\nwith such temporary employees, two circuit courts held that such\n\ntemporary employees were indeed \"government personnel\" within the\n\nmeaning of the Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii). United States v. Anderson, 778\n\nF.2d 602, 605 (10th Cir. 1985) (an expert witness on trust law);\n\nUnited States v. Lartey, 716 F.2d 955, 963-64 (2d Cir. 1983) (a\n\nretired I.R.S. agent).              Federal prosecutors also occasionally\n\nsought the assistance of state and local employees, attempting to\n\nshare secret grand jury materials with them.                 The district courts'\n\nresponses to such efforts were more mixed.                   Compare In re Grand\n\nJury Proceedings, 445 F. Supp. 349, 350 (D.R.I. 1978) (state and\n\nlocal    personnel      are   not    within    the   exception    for    government\n\npersonnel in the Rule); with In re 1979 Grand Jury Proceedings, 479\n\nF. Supp. 93, 95-96 (E.D.N.Y. 1979) (state and local personnel\n\nincluded).\n\n              Partially in response, Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) was amended in\n\n1985     to   include    expressly      personnel      \"of   a   state       or   state\n\nsubdivision\" within the term \"government personnel.\"                     See Fed. R.\n\n\n                                        -42-\n\fCrim. P. Rule 6, advisory committee's notes on 1985 amendments.\n\n\"It is clearly desirable,\" the Committee wrote, \"that federal and\n\nstate authorities cooperate, as they often do\" in complex cases\n\nsuch as \"major fraud cases\" and that federal prosecutors have\n\naccess to \"the assistance of state law enforcement personnel, which\n\ncould be uniquely beneficial.\"          Id.    Although increased disclosure\n\nwas obviously in tension with the general rule of grand jury\n\nsecrecy, the Committee \"emphasized that the disclosure permitted is\n\nlimited\": it is permissible only \"in connection with the attorney\n\nfor the government's 'duty to enforce criminal law' and only to\n\nthose   personnel    'deemed    necessary       .   .   .   to   assist'   in   the\n\nperformance of that duty.\"        Id.\n\n            Two important themes, for our purposes, can be discerned\n\nfrom this legislative history.                First, a key purpose of Rule\n\n6(e)(3)(A)(ii)      is   to   facilitate       cooperation       between   federal\n\nprosecutors and state personnel, who often are uniquely situated to\n\nassist in the investigation and prosecution of federal criminal\n\ncases. When court decisions tended to limit the potential for such\n\ncooperation because of concerns that state officials, who are not\n\nunder the control of the federal government, could not be entrusted\n\nwith grand jury materials, they were explicitly overruled by\n\nCongress.    Thus, Congress made a conscious decision to entrust\n\ncertain state, as well as federal, personnel with information\n\nconcerning matters before a grand jury under certain conditions.\n\n\n                                    -43-\n\fSecond, a primary safeguard for protecting the countervailing\n\ninterest    in     the    secrecy      of    grand     jury     proceedings     is   the\n\nrequirement      that     such    disclosure        must   be    necessary    for    the\n\nenforcement of criminal law.                Although the Rule's limitation to\n\n\"government personnel\" also helps to assure the secrecy of grand\n\njury   proceedings,        that   limit      was     not   contemplated    by    either\n\nCongress in 1977 or the Advisory Committee in 1985 as the primary\n\nmechanism for doing so.\n\n            These themes convince us that the exception in Rule\n\n6(e)(3)(A)(ii)           may     cover       the      unique      quasi-governmental\n\ninvestigators of the IFB, depending on the facts of the situation.\n\n            In many instances of insurance fraud in Massachusetts,\n\nIFB investigators, rather than members of a more classic state law\n\nenforcement agency, will be the individuals who will have the most\n\nin-depth knowledge of that fraud.                  This is a direct result of the\n\nway    in   which        Massachusetts        has     chosen     to   structure       its\n\ninvestigations into such matters.                   Congress clearly desired that\n\nRule   6(e)(3)(A)(ii)          would     allow     federal     prosecutors    to     take\n\nadvantage     of    the    state's       investigative         processes   when      such\n\ncooperation was necessary to prosecute federal crimes such as mail\n\nfraud.\n\n            Additionally, by specifically including state personnel\n\nin Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii), Congress chose to trust state officials\n\nthat the state itself had entrusted with the investigation of\n\n\n                                            -44-\n\fcriminal   matters.      Here,   Massachusetts     has   given    the   hybrid\n\nprivate/public IFB significant powers and responsibilities. In the\n\ncourse of their initial investigations, IFB investigators have\n\naccess to non-public information that is not normally available to\n\nprivate investigators.      § 13(d).     If that investigation leads the\n\nIFB executive director to refer the case to the Attorney General's\n\nOffice,    the   IFB   investigator    initially   assigned      to   the   case\n\nprovides significant support to the prosecuting attorney.                    See\n\nCommonwealth v. Harwood, 432 Mass. 290, 299 (2000) (\"[I]t has been\n\ncustomary for principal investigators from the IFB to provide\n\nongoing investigatory support for the Attorney General's subsequent\n\ninquiries.\").     Moreover, in state criminal prosecutions the state\n\nconsiders IFB agents to be assistants to prosecutors: \"for the\n\npurposes of preserving potentially exculpatory evidence,\" the IFB\n\nis \"under the general supervisory umbrella of the office of the\n\nprosecutor.\" Id. at 300.      Consequently, exculpatory evidence that\n\nIFB investigators lose can be attributed to the prosecution.                Id.\n\n            We do not know the many factual variations that could be\n\npresented by use of IFB personnel on federal criminal investigative\n\nteams; we do not hold that all IFB personnel are qualified as a\n\nmatter of status.       Because the interest in the secrecy of grand\n\njury proceedings is intense, this is not an area for categorical\n\napprovals tied to labels.        The mere fact that a person works for\n\n\n\n\n                                      -45-\n\f    the IFB does not mean that he or she fits the definition for\n\n    government personnel within Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii).\n\n                For this reason, we do not consider that the prosecution\n\n    has self-executing powers under Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) simply to\n\n    designate IFB personnel as recipients of grand jury material.\n\n    Rather, the prosecutor must seek court authorization where quasi-\n\n    governmental agencies such as the IFB are involved and make a\n\n    functional showing that the individual involved is within the Rule.\n\n    In the past, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts has\n\n    chosen to seek court authorization first, on a case-by-case basis\n\n    whenever it wishes IFB personnel to be involved.          It should\n\n    continue to do so.\n\n                                     V.\n\n                The district court's grant of the Rule 29 motion is\n\n    reversed.    The denial of the motion to dismiss the indictment is\n\n    affirmed and the renewal of that motion is denied.      The case is\n\n    remanded to the district court for sentencing.\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n                                    -46-\n\f",

The government appeals the district court's dismissal of two counts on which a jury had convicted, while the defendant cross-appeals on the ground that the entire case should have been dismissed because of an alleged violation of the grand jury secrecy rule, embodied in Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e). We conclude, despite the able representation of Pimental, that (1) the district court erred in dismissing the two counts and we reinstate the jury convictions and conclude that (2) there was no violation by the prosecution here of Rule 6(e) at all. This second point is a matter of first impression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a jury convicted Arthur Pimental of two counts of mail fraud, the district court dismissed the convictions because it found that the two underlying mailings were not \"in furtherance\" of Pimental's fraudulent scheme. <i>United States v. Pimental,</i> 236 F.Supp.2d 99 (D.Mass.2002). Pimental's scheme involved lying to various workers' compensation insurance company representatives about the nature and scope of his company's work; his false statements tended to reduce the premium payments he owed for workers' compensation insurance. The government appeals the district court's decision, arguing that the two mailings furthered Pimental's scheme by helping to ensure that the insurance company did not discover his earlier misrepresentations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental cross-appeals, arguing that his indictment should be dismissed because the prosecuting attorney disclosed secret grand jury materials to an investigator for the Massachusetts Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB). Pimental argues that the rule allowing disclosure of grand jury materials to \"government personnel\" in certain circumstances, Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(a)(ii), was inapplicable because the IFB investigator was a private actor. The IFB, which investigates potential cases of insurance fraud, is authorized and structured by Massachusetts statute, but partially run and entirely funded by insurers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse the district court's dismissal of Pimental's convictions, finding that the mailings by insurance company representatives that formed the basis of the two counts of conviction were indeed in furtherance of Pimental's fraudulent scheme. Additionally, we reject Pimental's cross-appeal because we conclude that the first district court (not the trial court) did not err when it found the IFB investigators here are \"government personnel\" within the meaning of Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) and so authorized the prosecutor to reveal grand jury materials to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are described in the light most favorable to the jury's guilty verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arthur Pimental and his wife, Loretta Pimental (for ease of reference we refer to her as Loretta and to Arthur as Pimental), owned and operated Pimental Steel Erectors (\"Pimental Steel\") starting sometime in the early 1980's. In late 1989, Pimental Steel allowed its workers' compensation insurance to lapse; this violated Massachusetts law. Massachusetts requires all employers to maintain workers' compensation insurance which covers their employees in the case of an on-the-job injury or job-related illness. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 152, &#167; 25A. Over three years later, in April 1993, Arthur Pimental mailed a written application to the Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau (MWCRIB) to resume Pimental Steel's workers' compensation coverage. MWCRIB, a private non-profit association of insurers that is licensed under Massachusetts law, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 152. &#167; 52C, uses a risk pool to assign insurance companies to provide workers' compensation insurance on pre-set terms to applicant-employers. The fraud charges started here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the MWCRIB application form, Pimental described the operations of his business as involving \"concrete construction incl[uding] foundations\" and added that it \"puts in foundations.\" Concrete foundation work involves laying concrete and reinforcing it with steel rods and is also known as \"rebar.\" MWCRIB processed the application, assigned it to the Hartford Fire Insurance Company (\"Hartford Insurance\"), and notified Pimental via the mail that the estimated premium for the year, based on his application, was $12,425.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite what was said in the MWCRIB application, Pimental Steel had never at any point been involved in concrete foundation work. Rather, throughout the relevant period, its business performed mainly steel erection and related work, such as welding and decking. Steel erection involves the placement of girders, columns, and joints to support a structure, then laying corrugated-metal decking for the ceiling and floors of the building and welding it into place. Steel erection work carries a significantly higher risk of injury than does concrete foundation work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because workers' compensation premiums are set based upon the kind of work performed and the amount of a business's payroll, Pimental's incorrect description on the MWCRIB application affected the premium payments Pimental Steel owed. In 1993, the premium payment for steel erection of structures over two stories was $99.35 per every hundred dollars of payroll<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> (reduced to $69.22 for structures under two stories), while the rate was $41.22 for concrete foundation work. Some of the work that Pimental Steel actually performed, however, had <i>lower</i> premium rates than concrete foundation work: the rate for decking was $24.66 or $19.82, depending on the type of metal used, while the rate for welding was $23.56. Where, as in the case of Pimental Steel, employees perform tasks that have different premium rates, the total premium cost can be calculated by parsing out the hours that employees spent on each different task, so long as appropriate documentation is maintained. One witness testified that 80% of the work Pimental Steel did for him was steel erection and decking and that the remaining 20% was \"miscellaneous.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September of 1993, Joseph F. Brugman, an auditor for Hartford Insurance, met with Loretta Pimental to perform an initial audit on Pimental Steel's insurance application. In addition to such initial audits, which are conducted at the start of an insurer's relationship with an insured, insurers normally perform audits once a year at the conclusion of each annual policy period. The auditors determine the insurance classification for the work that the insured's employees performed and the total amount of salary paid to them. Using this information, the insurance companies calculate the final amount that the employer owes for the year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the initial audit meeting, Loretta told Brugman that Pimental Steel was, as the MWCRIB application had represented, involved in concrete foundation work. She did not tell Brugman that Pimental Steel was involved in any way in steel erection, welding, or decking, even though Brugman explained to her that Pimental Steel's operations could be split into different classifications for insurance purposes. At the later year-end audit in July 1994, also conducted by Brugman, Loretta repeated this description of Pimental Steel's business operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months after Brugman conducted his year-end audit, William Brooks, a loss-control inspector for Hartford Insurance, met with Arthur Pimental. In contrast to auditors, the purpose of loss-control inspectors is not to verify the accuracy of the information given by policyholders, but instead to \"assist[] policyholders in their efforts to control costly accidents and/or injuries.\" During that meeting Pimental once again represented, wrongly, that his business involved rebar. Pimental also told Brooks that he did not currently have any employees and that there were not any ongoing projects that Brooks could observe. This was also not true: Pimental paid an employee wages three days after his meeting with Brugman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 5, 1994, Brooks mailed an \"Account Data Report\" to Hartford Insurance that summarized his meeting with Pimental. The letter began by stating that \"[t]he insured describes his business [ ]as that of the installation of reenforcing bars and rods for floors and walls.\" Brooks's standard practice is to inform insureds that he will turn over a copy of his loss-control report to the insurance company, and that the company will inform the employer of any recommendations to improve worker safety. However, Brooks testified that he had no specific recollection of whether he had informed Pimental of this procedure during their meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pimentals renewed their workers' compensation insurance coverage with Hartford Insurance in May 1995. Hartford sent them a letter detailing the terms of coverage; under the heading \"Business of Named Insured,\" the letter read \"concrete construction.\" In July 1995, Hartford auditor Mark Lawrence met with Loretta Pimental to conduct an audit of the May 1994 to May 1995 policy period. During that meeting, Lawrence asked Loretta if the company did any steel erection work, given that the company's name is \"Pimental Steel Erectors.\" Loretta responded that the company only did concrete rebar work, and did not work on steel erection, despite its name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawrence also asked Loretta for documentation of Pimental Steel's wage payments to employees. Loretta told Lawrence that there was no single record detailing payroll. Instead, she provided him with a checkbook that had been used to make payroll payments, along with a written summary of that checkbook, and told him that there were no additional records. From these documents, Lawrence calculated that Pimental Steel had paid $28,885 in salary to its employees for the year from May 1994 to May 1995, resulting in a total premium of $13,586. In fact, Pimental Steel's actual payroll during that period was $85,499, a figure which would have led to a larger premium. The Pimentals used non-sequentially numbered checks in their business and it appears that the single checkbook given to Lawrence contained only a fraction of all the checks written on behalf of Pimental Steel from the previous year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1995, Hartford Insurance attempted to arrange another loss-control meeting with Arthur Pimental. After Pimental did not respond to three separate inquiries, Timothy Bergeron, a Senior Loss-Control Consultant for Hartford Insurance, sent him a final letter stating that \"failure to allow reasonable access for the purpose of loss-control consultation is a violation of the good faith provisions in the Workers' Compensation Insurance Plan and can subject your policy to cancellation.\" Under that threat of cancellation, Pimental finally met with Bergeron on September 21, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the meeting, Pimental told Bergeron that Pimental Steel continued to perform rebar work; he falsely said the company did not perform any structural steel erection or metal deck work. He also falsely told Bergeron that there were currently no jobs in progress that could be inspected. His bank records reveal, however, that three employees were paid their wages that same day. During the meeting, Bergeron told Pimental that he was going to prepare a report summarizing their meeting and would mail it to Hartford Insurance. Bergeron testified that he told Pimental that he would send the loss-control report to Hartford Insurance, and Brooks indicated that it was his standard practice to tell the insured that the loss-control report would be forwarded to the insurance company. Bergeron kept a copy of the report in Hartford Insurance's Boston branch (where he was stationed) and sent a copy to the company's branch in San Antonio, Texas \"that issues the policy and distributes all the policies regarding the assigned risk pool.\" On October 5, 1995, Bergeron also mailed a letter to Pimental summarizing their meeting and stating that \"[y]our company continues to bid work as a subcontractor installing reinforcement bar.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental again renewed the company's workers' compensation insurance in May 1996, and Hartford Insurance again mailed a letter to Pimental detailing the coverage and repeating that the nature of the company's business was \"concrete construction.\" Later that summer, Lawrence wrote a letter to the Pimentals requesting certain documents that were needed to perform a year-end audit for the May 1995-to-May 1996 coverage period. The Pimentals never provided Lawrence with any of the requested documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Lawrence met with Loretta Pimental for the annual audit on August 9, 1996, the only documentation that she provided was Pimental Steel's checkbook; she claimed to have been unaware of the records Lawrence had requested and to have lost the letter he had sent to her. As a result, Lawrence determined that Pimental Steel's account was \"unauditable\" and his report to Hartford Insurance simply estimated a payroll of $31,500 based on the checkbook that Loretta had provided. This estimate was less than 20% of Pimental Steel's actual payroll of $158,653 for that time period. Consequently, the $19,374 in premiums that the Pimentals were charged was also less than 20% of what they actually owed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1996, Arthur Pimental, perhaps concerned that Hartford Insurance might cancel Pimental Steel's policy for failure to provide requested documentation, submitted a second application for workers' compensation insurance to MWCRIB. This application contained a new name for the company; it was now called A.P.S. Products, Inc., rather than Pimental Steel Erectors. (We continue to refer to Pimental's company as \"Pimental Steel\" despite this name change). The application once again described the company's operations as \"[i]nstall steel for concrete reinforcement,\" and stated that its total payroll was $65,000 per year and that it employed only two workers. During the previous six months, the Pimentals' company actually paid salary to between four and seven employees on a weekly basis, and the company's payroll for those six months totaled approximately $83,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MWCRIB assigned the insurance application to Employers Insurance of Wausau (Wausau Insurance) and sent a letter to Pimental informing him of the assignment and stating that the estimated premium was $37,600. The Pimentals then began a pattern of deception with Wausau Insurance similar to that employed with Hartford Insurance. Arthur told auditors for Wausau Insurance that A.P.S. Products did concrete rebar construction rather than the steel erection, welding, or decking work that it actually performed. Loretta, in turn, initially provided Wausau Insurance with incomplete records that significantly underrepresented the company's payroll.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of a block transfer of policies, MWCRIB reassigned the Pimentals' insurance coverage from Wausau Insurance to Savers Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company (\"Savers Insurance\") in October of 1997. Using the 1996 MWCRIB application as well as Wausau's most recent policy, Savers Insurance initially calculated a $33,671 yearly premium based on a $65,000 payroll in concrete rebar. Once again, the Pimentals misrepresented the nature of their business to Savers Insurance. Arthur Pimental told a loss-control inspector for Savers Insurance that his company only worked on concrete rebar. Further, the Pimentals failed to respond to several inquiries from Savers Insurance auditors, resulting in Savers Insurance using a 50% increased payroll figure of $97,500 for the 1997-to-1998 coverage period. This was still substantially smaller than the actual payroll figure of $168,162.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In total, from October 1993 to August 1998, the Pimentals paid their employees approximately $738,000 in salary. The insurance premiums they paid during this period were based on a payroll of less than half that amount &#8212; about $340,000. Throughout the time period, the Pimentals paid premium rates for concrete rebar even though their work consisted almost entirely of steel erection, welding, and decking. Because different premium rates apply to each of these three activities and there was little evidence concerning how many employee hours were dedicated to each separate activity, the extent of the monetary benefit the Pimentals received from misrepresenting their business is unclear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> A jury could easily infer that the premiums would have been higher if Pimental had been honest in what he told his insurers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 29, 1999, Arthur and Loretta Pimental were each indicted on one conspiracy count, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, and fourteen counts of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341. Before trial, the Pimentals moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the government had violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e) when it disclosed, after earlier receiving permission from another judge on the court to do so, grand jury materials to an investigator for the Insurance Fraud Bureau of Massachusetts. <i>Pimental,</i> 236 F.Supp.2d at 103. In a trio of pretrial opinions, the district court held that there had been a Rule 6(e) violation (despite the prior approval of a different judge of the court), but held that the violation was harmless because the grand jury testimony that resulted from the transmittal of information to the IFB investigator was not crucial to the grand jury's decision to indict. <i>United States v. Pimental,</i> 204 F.R.D. 223 (D.Mass.2001); <i>United States v. Pimental,</i> 201 F.R.D. 24 (D.Mass.2001); <i>United States v. Pimental,</i> 199 F.R.D. 28 (D.Mass.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government voluntarily dismissed three of the mail fraud counts on September 16, 2002, and the case proceeded to trial the next day. <i>Pimental,</i> 236 F.Supp.2d at 104. After six days of testimony, a jury acquitted Loretta Pimental on all counts and acquitted Arthur Pimental on the conspiracy count and nine of the eleven mail fraud counts. The two mail fraud counts on which the jury convicted Arthur Pimental were both based on mailings sent by loss-control inspectors. The first count was premised on the October 5, 1994 mailing from William Brooks to Hartford Insurance, in which Brooks reported that Arthur Pimental had said that Pimental Steel Erectors only performed concrete rebar work. The second count was based on the letter from Timothy Bergeron to Arthur Pimental summarizing their meeting and noting that Pimental Steel was, according to Pimental, involved only in concrete rebar work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury returned its verdict, Arthur Pimental moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c). He also renewed his motion for a dismissal of the indictment, arguing that evidence presented at trial provided a previously unavailable basis for believing that the information disclosed to the IFB investigator had substantially influenced the grand jury's decision to indict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the existence of a scheme to defraud and that the mailings were reasonably foreseeable. <i>Id.</i> at 109, 110. But it nonetheless granted Pimental's Rule 29 motion because it concluded that there was not sufficient evidence that either mailing was in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme. <i>Id.</i> It also declined to rule on Pimental's renewed motion for dismissal of the indictment based on the Rule 6(e) violation, finding that this issue was mooted by its grant of the Rule 29 motion. <i>Id.</i> at 112.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appeals the district court's grant of the Rule 29 motion. Arthur Pimental, in turn, cross-appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment for the Rule 6(e) violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. The Rule 29 Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's Rule 29 determinations is de novo. <i>United</i> <i>States v. Moran,</i> 312 F.3d 480, 487 (1st Cir.2002). A judgment of acquittal should only be granted when the evidence and all reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence, both taken in the light most favorable to the government, are insufficient for a rational factfinder to conclude that the prosecution has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, each of the elements of the offense. <i>Id.; United States v. Campbell,</i> 268 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2001). \"Under this formulation, a court considers all the evidence, direct and circumstantial, and resolves all evidentiary conflicts in favor of the verdict.\" <i>Moran,</i> 312 F.3d at 487.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To demonstrate a violation of the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341, the prosecution must prove \"(1) the devising or attempting to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) the knowing and willing participation in the scheme with the specific intent to defraud; and (3) the use of the mails in furtherance of the scheme.\" <i>United States v. McCann,</i> 366 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>United States v. Montminy,</i> 936 F.2d 626, 627 (1st Cir.1991)). The government must also demonstrate, in order to prove causation, that the defendant knew, or could have reasonably foreseen, that \"the use of the mails [would] follow in the ordinary course of business.\" <i>Pereira v. United States,</i> 347 U.S. 1, 9, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954); <i>cf. United States v. Fermin Castillo,</i> 829 F.2d 1194, 1198-99 (1st Cir.1987) (interpreting wire fraud statute). \"It is not necessary to prove that the defendant personally executed the mailings, but merely that the defendant `caused the mailing by doing some act from which it is reasonably foreseeable that the mails will be used.'\" <i>United States v. Bruckman,</i> 874 F.2d 57, 60 (1st Cir.1989) (quoting <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Sanchez,</i> 825 F.2d 572, 588 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was easily sufficient evidence for the jury to find the existence of a scheme to defraud and that the use of the mails was reasonably foreseeable, as discussed below. As to the \"in furtherance of\" requirement, the district court erred in holding that there was not sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the two loss-control inspectors' mailings were in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme. Accordingly, we reverse the grant of the Rule 29 motion and reinstate the convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Existence of a Scheme to Defraud</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental challenges the district court's conclusion that there was sufficient evidence of a scheme to defraud, hoping to knock out the convictions on grounds other than those relied upon by the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> First, he argues that the evidence at trial did not establish that Pimental Steel's employees were actually covered by workers' compensation insurance when they were performing steel erection. Pimental says the jury had no way of eliminating the possibility that if he had submitted a claim on behalf of an injured employee, the insurance company would have discovered the incorrect premium payments and thus refused to pay the employee. Pimental does not contest the district court's conclusion that, as a matter of Massachusetts law, the insurance company would be obliged to cover Pimental Steel's employees under such circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Pimental,</i> 236 F.Supp.2d at 106 (relying on <i>Employers Mutual Liability Insurance Co. of Wisconsin v. Merrimac Mills Co.,</i> 325 Mass. 676, 681, 92 N.E.2d 256 (1950)). But he says that there was no evidentiary basis for <i>the jury</i> to reach this conclusion. From this premise, Pimental argues that the jury could not have found that the insurers suffered any loss as a result of Pimental's actions. And that, concludes Pimental, means that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that there existed a \"scheme to defraud.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental's argument goes too far. In order to find a \"scheme to defraud,\" the jury simply had to determine that Pimental was attempting to \"wrong[ ] one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes.\" <i>McNally v. United States,</i> 483 U.S. 350, 358, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987) (quoting <i>Hammerschmidt v. United States,</i> 265 U.S. 182, 188, 44 S.Ct. 511, 68 L.Ed. 968 (1924)). Here, there was more than sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Pimental lied about the nature of his company's work in order to pay cheaper premiums on his workers' compensation insurance. The jury easily could have concluded that Pimental was attempting to dishonestly minimize the insurance premiums to the company that he should have been paying under Massachusetts law. The speculative possibility that if an employee had filed a claim with Hartford Insurance, it would have discovered Pimental's lies and refused to pay the employee is irrelevant. To convict, the jury need not have drawn any additional conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental also argues that there was insufficient evidence of a scheme to defraud because the evidence was inconclusive as to whether he ultimately paid premiums that were less than what he actually owed, for the reasons discussed earlier. But whether Pimental actually paid more or less in premiums than he actually owed goes only to the success of his fraudulent scheme, not to its existence. <i>See United States v. Martin,</i> 228 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir.2000) (success in scheme is not needed to support mail fraud conviction). In addition, the argument fails on its own terms. A rational jury could have found that Pimental, because of his own actions, did not in fact have the option of making variable premium payments according to the amount of time that his workers spent performing different job tasks. The evidence at trial established only that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The payroll of an individual employee may be divided and allocated to more than one classification, <i>provided the entries in the original records of the insured disclose an allocation of each such individual employee's payroll.</i> Any such operation for which separate payroll records are not maintained shall be assigned to the highest rated classification which applies to the job or location where the operation is performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). There was extensive testimony that the Pimentals specifically chose not to keep records documenting the breakdown of their employees' work and that they repeatedly misled the insurance company concerning their payroll in order to pay lower rates. A reasonable jury could have easily found that the Pimentals did not maintain \"separate payroll records\" and hence that the rate they should have paid, for all payroll hours, was the rate for steel erection. This would have been significantly more than the amount they actually paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The \"In Furtherance Of\" Requirement</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order for a mailing to be \"in furtherance\" of a fraudulent scheme, it \"must be for the purpose of executing the scheme,\" <i>United States v. Maze,</i> 414 U.S. 395, 399-400, 94 S.Ct. 645, 38 L.Ed.2d 603 (1974) (quoting <i>Kann v. United States,</i> 323 U.S. 88, 94, 65 S.Ct. 148, 89 L.Ed. 88 (1944)), or \"part of the execution of the scheme as conceived by the perpetrator at the time,\" <i>Schmuck v. United States,</i> 489 U.S. 705, 715, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989). The mailing \"need not be an essential element of the scheme\"; it can be merely \"incident to an essential part of the scheme,\" <i>id.</i> at 710-11, 109 S.Ct. 1443 (quoting <i>Pereira,</i> 347 U.S. at 8, 74 S.Ct. 358), or \"a step in [the] plot,\" <i>id.</i> at 711, 74 S.Ct. 358 (quoting <i>Badders v. United States,</i> 240 U.S. 391, 394, 36 S.Ct. 367, 60 L.Ed. 706 (1916)); <i>see also McCann,</i> 366 F.3d at 52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) <i>Count Two Conviction &#8212; Brooks's Account Data Report</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mailing that formed the basis of Count Two, on which the jury convicted Pimental, was Brooks's October 5, 1994 \"Account Data Report\" to Hartford Insurance, which recounted the substance of his loss-control interview with Pimental. In that report, Brooks wrote that Pimental had said that his business involved only rebar construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Schmuck,</i> the Supreme Court addressed the \"in furtherance of\" requirement with respect to a mailing of some similarity to Brooks's loss-control report. The defendant in <i>Schmuck</i> purchased used cars, rolled back their odometers, and then resold them to retail dealerships, who, in turn, sold them to consumers. 489 U.S. at 707, 109 S.Ct. 1443. The Court held that the mailing of a title-application form from the dealership that purchased Schmuck's vehicle to a state agency, at the time of the dealership's sale of the car to the end-consumer, met the \"in furtherance of\" element of the mail fraud statute. <i>Id.</i> at 710-12, 109 S.Ct. 1443. In cases of \"ongoing fraudulent venture[s],\" reasoned the Court, mailings that help maintain a harmonious relationship between the perpetrator and the victim further the fraudulent scheme by helping to ensure its continued success in the future. <i>Id.</i> at 711-12, 109 S.Ct. 1443. Even though such mailings were not absolutely necessary for the scheme to succeed in the short term, they allowed the dealerships who purchased the cars from Schmuck to sell them to the ultimate consumer and thus helped guarantee that the dealerships would continue to purchase cars from Schmuck in the future. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, the mailing from Brooks to Hartford Insurance helped Pimental maintain his ongoing fraudulent venture by ensuring that he continued to receive insurance coverage. The jury was entitled to conclude that had Brooks never mailed his loss-control report, Hartford Insurance would have terminated its insurance coverage and Pimental's scheme would have, at least temporarily, come to a halt. Indeed, Pimental's policy with Hartford Insurance was threatened with cancellation when he attempted to avoid a loss-control interview in the summer of 1995 by ignoring repeated inquiries from Bergeron. If Hartford Insurance were not to receive a completed loss-control report, Bergeron's letter warned, Pimental's insurance coverage would be \"subject ... to cancellation.\" A rational jury could have readily found that the loss-control report from Brooks to Hartford Insurance furthered Pimental's fraudulent scheme because it was a necessary step in the continued relationship between Pimental and his victim, Hartford Insurance. <i>Cf. United States v.</i> <i>Woodward,</i> 149 F.3d 46, 64-65 (1st Cir.1998) (in ongoing scheme in which lobbyist made illegal purchases for a public official, the mailing of a credit card bill to the lobbyist satisfied the \"in furtherance of\" requirement because if the lobbyist \"did not pay [the] bills, his credit line would have been terminated and the gratuities could not have continued\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court reached the opposite conclusion by relying on a statement in a post-<i>Schmuck</i> First Circuit case, <i>United States v. Pacheco-Ortiz,</i> 889 F.2d 301, 305 (1st Cir.1989), that the perpetration of the fraud or its subsequent cover-up must have \"depended in some way on\" the mailing. <i>Pimental,</i> 236 F.Supp.2d at 108. The court interpreted this formulation to impose a \"but for\" test for the \"in furtherance of\" element of mail fraud &#8212; i.e. that a fraudulent scheme \"depends on\" a mailing only when but for that mailing, the scheme could not have succeeded or would have been discovered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The district court concluded that <i>Pacheco-Ortiz</i>'s use of \"depends on\" meant \"but-for\" despite language in <i>Pacheco-Ortiz</i> that also said that it was not necessary that each mailing guarantee the success of the scheme or even significantly advance it &#8212; that it only need be closely related to the scheme. 889 F.2d at 305.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying its approach, the district court found that there was no evidence that, absent the mailing of the loss-control report, Hartford would necessarily have uncovered the scheme and terminated Pimental's coverage. Although the court noted that it was possible that a loss-control report describing the Pimentals' business as steel erection \"might have raised an eyebrow\" at the insurance company, it concluded that the government did not present sufficient evidence on this point; the evidence did not demonstrate that \"the jig would have been up\" had Brooks's loss-control report stated that the Pimentals' business was steel erection. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's search for a direct, but-for, link between Brooks's mailing and the fraudulent element of Pimental's scheme &#8212; the claim that his business involved concrete rebar and not steel erection &#8212; misapprehended the law in two ways. First, a mail fraud conviction does not require the existence of a \"but-for\" link between the mailing and the fraud, or its cover-up. Such a rule would harken back to the oft-rejected notion that the mailing needs to be connected with the essence of the fraud. It need not be, so long as it is \"incident to an essential element of the fraud.\" <i>See Schmuck</i> at 710-11, 109 S.Ct. 1443. For instance, in <i>Schmuck</i> itself there was no but-for relationship between the success of the scheme and the mailing of the title-application form. Schmuck could have continued selling cars that had been tampered with even if the dealerships that bought those cars did not mail the title-application forms. The mailings were nonetheless \"in furtherance\" of the scheme because they contributed to its overall success by making it more likely that dealerships would come back to Schmuck to purchase more cars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, mailings that are designed to \"lull the victims into a false sense of security, postpone their ultimate complaint to the authorities, and therefore make the apprehension of the defendant[ ] <i>less likely</i> than if no mailings had taken place\" are sufficient under the statute. <i>United States v. Lane,</i> 474 U.S. 438, 451-52, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986) (quoting <i>Maze,</i> 414 U.S. at 403, 94 S.Ct. 645) (emphasis added); <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 71 F.3d 954, 961-62 (1st Cir.1995). Preventing the detection of an ongoing or a completed fraudulent scheme is not contingent on lulling the victim into a false sense of security. Instead, lulling the victim into a false sense of security <i>contributes to</i> the prevention of the scheme's detection by making detection of the scheme less likely. This is sufficient to satisfy the \"in furtherance of\" requirement of the mail fraud statute. <i>See, e.g., McCann,</i> 366 F.3d at 53 (letter sent after the culmination of the fraud was in furtherance of fraud because it \"served the important purpose of decreasing the risk of detection\"); <i>Lopez,</i> 71 F.3d at 956-57, 961 (fax sent two years after culmination of fraud that attempted to explain certain documents that were submitted to cover-up the illegal withdrawal was in furtherance of fraudulent scheme in wire fraud conviction because it made defendant's apprehension less likely); <i>United States v. Young,</i> 955 F.2d 99, 108 (1st Cir.1992) (Breyer, J.) (mailings that misrepresented disposition of embezzled funds helped conceal the fraud and were thus sufficient to meet the \"in furtherance of\" requirement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second, independent, problem with the district court's analysis is that it focused exclusively on Pimental's misrepresentations in determining whether the mailings furthered his overall scheme. In fact, even under the district court's overly stringent and incorrect but-for test, the jury would have been entitled to conclude that Pimental's scheme depended on Brooks's mailing. The reason is that the success of the scheme did not simply depend on Pimental lying about the nature of his business's operations &#8212; it also depended, among other things, on the mailing and processing of loss-control reports. Were those reports not mailed, there was significant evidence that Hartford Insurance would have cancelled the Pimentals' coverage. One of the central points of <i>Schmuck</i> is that a mailing that is itself innocent and that seems to accomplish an innocent end can nonetheless be in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) <i>Count Four Conviction &#8212; Bergeron's Mailing to Pimental</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second Count on which Pimental was convicted is premised on Bergeron's mailing to Pimental himself of a summary of the loss-control interview. In this mailing, Bergeron states, based on what Pimental said in the interview, that Pimental's business continued to be the installation of concrete reinforcement bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental argues that whether he received a summary of his meeting with Bergeron was immaterial to whether Hartford Insurance would continue to provide the Pimentals with insurance for their employees at the incorrect rate. Pimental also argues that lying to loss-control inspectors as opposed to lying to auditors was not an essential part of the scheme. This was particularly so, says Pimental, because the evidence was that the loss-control division of Hartford Insurance was entirely separate from the division that set premiums and investigated fraud. Indeed, Brooks was not even an employee of Hartford Insurance, but was instead an independent contractor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury easily could have concluded that Pimental needed to be or thought he needed to be consistent in his lies to representatives of the insurer, regardless of who the representative was. It is not hard to infer that an inconsistent report from a loss-control inspector could somehow trigger alarms in the premium setting group. The harder question is why a letter <i>to Pimental,</i> recounting his fraudulent statements, was in furtherance of the fraud. There are several responses. One is that Pimental now knew that his deception of the inspector was successful &#8212; his copy showed that his lies were being sent to the company records. This could only encourage him in the scheme. Further, there was an obvious purpose to Bergeron sending a summary of his report to Pimental &#8212; it allowed Pimental to correct any inaccurate information on the report. Pimental chose not to correct the misinformation, thus perpetuating the fraud and demonstrating further his fraudulent intent. <i>See United States v. Morrow,</i> 39 F.3d 1228, 1236-37 (1st Cir.1994) (in insurance fraud scheme, the insurance company's mailing to the insured acknowledging that it had received the fraudulent claim was, under the <i>Schmuck</i> formulation, \"`incidental' to an essential element in the scheme\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(C) <i>Causation: Were the Mailings Reasonably Foreseeable?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that he \"caused\" either of the mailings at issue because neither of them was reasonably foreseeable. <i>See Pereira,</i> 347 U.S. at 8-9, 74 S.Ct. 358. There was no evidence, according to Pimental, of a \"course of business\" between himself and his insurers that would have led a reasonable person to have anticipated either of the mailings that formed the basis for his convictions. He points to evidence that Brooks could not recall ever telling Pimental that the loss-control report would be mailed to Hartford Insurance. Similarly, Bergeron testified only that he told Pimental that he would send the loss-control report to Hartford, not that he would send it to Pimental himself. All of this, concludes Pimental, means there was no way that he could reasonably foresee that either Brooks's or Bergeron's letters would ever be written or mailed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental's arguments are premised on an incorrect understanding of the law. As the district court correctly held, it is simply the \"use of the mails\" in the course of the scheme rather than the particular mailing at issue that must be reasonably foreseeable for the causation element of a mail fraud offense to be satisfied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Morrow,</i> 39 F.3d at 1237 (all that is required to show causation is that the defendant \"participated in a crime in which it was foreseeable ... that the mails would be used\" and that was satisfied where defendant \"admitted at trial that he knew that automobile insurance claims are processed in part through the use of the mails\"); <i>Bruckman,</i> 874 F.2d at 60 (\"[T]he causation element is met as long as some use of the mails was reasonably to be anticipated in the course of the scheme.\"); <i>Fermin Castillo,</i> 829 F.2d at 1198 (\"As long as some use of the instrumentality in the course of the endeavor was reasonably to be anticipated, the causation requirement is met.\"); <i>see also United States v. Bortnovsky,</i> 879 F.2d 30, 38-39 (2d Cir.1989) (noting that the causation element of mail fraud \"has been so liberally construed as to suggest that it requires only that the use of the mail itself, rather than a particular mailing, be reasonably foreseeable\" and endorsing that view).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principle that it is the use of the mails (rather than the specific mailing that is charged) that must be reasonably foreseeable as a result of the scheme is affirmed by one of the primary cases upon which Pimental relies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In <i>United States v. Walters,</i> 997 F.2d 1219 (7th Cir.1993), the court held that there was insufficient evidence on the causation element of a mail fraud offense because the evidence did not establish \"that [the defendant] conceived a scheme in which mailings played a role.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1222. Rather than focus on the predictability of specific mailings in the indictment, the <i>Walters</i> court thus premised its analysis on the question of whether the use of the mails, as a general matter, was a foreseeable component of the scheme to defraud. <i>See id.</i> at 1223-24. Indeed, in the course of its analysis, the court noted that insurance fraud is the \"paradigm\" case in which the use of the mails is reasonably foreseeable because the payment and submission of insurance claims typically involves mailings between the insurance company's agents and the insured. <i>See id.</i> at 1223. So here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Pimental's Cross-Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During its preliminary investigations in this case, the U.S. Attorney's office filed an ex parte motion with the district court seeking permission, on the basis of the exception to grand jury secrecy, to disclose grand jury materials to investigators and analysts of the IFB. The exception allows disclosure of grand jury materials to \"any government personnel &#8212; including those of a state or state subdivision\" when such disclosure is necessary to prosecute a criminal case. Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(A)(ii). The district court motion judge, who was not the trial judge, granted the motion without opinion. No disclosure was made by the prosecutor without court permission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, during pretrial discovery, Pimental moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the government had violated Rule 6(e) when it disclosed to Scott Faragi, an IFB investigator who later testified before the grand jury, Pimental's bank records and other material that had been obtained through the grand jury's subpoena powers. Pimental argued that IFB agents such as Faragi were not \"government personnel\" within the meaning of Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii), and thus the exception to grand jury secrecy was not applicable and the earlier district court order was wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the trial court held that IFB investigators can not be \"government personnel\" within the meaning of Rule 6(e), and thus that the earlier ruling allowing the prosecutor to disclose grand jury materials to IFB investigators was in error. <i>Pimental,</i> 199 F.R.D. at 33-37 (D.Mass.2001); <i>Pimental,</i> 201 F.R.D. at 25-26. It did not hold that because the disclosure had been authorized by the court, there could be no dismissal of the indictment. Rather, the district court refused to dismiss Pimental's indictment because the \"error\" did not substantially affect the grand jury's decision to indict, and thus it was harmless. <i>Pimental,</i> 204 F.R.D. at 227-28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental now challenges this pre-trial denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment. He also asks this court to consider his post-trial renewal of that motion, which the district court found to be moot due to its grant of Pimental's Rule 29 motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the first district court's implicit conclusion that IFB agents are \"government personnel &#8212; including those of a state or state subdivision\" within the meaning of Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) was, on these facts, not error. We do not hold that all IFB employees, regardless of the circumstances, are government personnel, but only that here that decision was correct. We thus affirm on alternate grounds the denial of Pimental's motion to dismiss the indictment, which disposes of his post-trial renewal of the motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See Bonano v.

Grand jury secrecy facilitates the investigation of criminal charges by assuring potential witnesses that their testimony will not become public knowledge, thus encouraging them to testify freely and limiting the potential that they will be improperly influenced by those under investigation. <i>See id.</i> At the same time, it ensures \"that persons who are accused but exonerated by the grand jury will not be held up to public ridicule.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Douglas Oil Co. v.

Rule 6(e) also contains certain exceptions to the general secrecy requirement. The first pertinent exception at issue in this case, under subpart (3)(A)(ii), allows \"[d]isclosure of a grand-jury matter\" to \"any government personnel &#8212; including those of a state or state subdivision or of an Indian tribe &#8212; that an attorney for the government considers necessary to assist in performing that attorney's duty to enforce federal criminal law.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(A)(ii). The second, under 6(e)(3)(E), empowers a district court to authorize disclosure in certain situations.

Ellis,</i> 429 Mass. 362, 365, 708 N.E.2d 644 (1999). Its creation was authorized by Massachusetts statute, St.1996, c. 427, &#167; 13,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and carried out by two voluntary associations of Massachusetts insurance carriers, the MWCRIB and the Automobile Insurance Bureau (AIB), which are themselves licensed under Massachusetts law. <i>See id.</i> at 13; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175A &#167; 8 (licensing AIB); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152 &#167; 52C (licensing MWCRIB). <i>See generally Ellis,</i> 429 Mass. at 365, 708 N.E.2d 644. The authorizing statute requires that the MWCRIB and AIB each fund half of the IFB's budget, &#167; 13(c), and each provide the IFB with five of its fifteen Board members, &#167; 13(a). The remaining five IFB Board members are Massachusetts public officials. &#167; 13(a). Under the statutory scheme, every insurer \"having reason to believe that an insurance transaction is fraudulent\" must advise the IFB of its suspicions. &#167; 13(e). The IFB, in turn, is required to review those cases and investigate further when necessary. &#167; 13(f). Where the IFB's executive director \"is satisfied that a material fraud, deceit, or intentional misrepresentation has been committed in an insurance transaction,\" he must \"refer the matter to the attorney general, the appropriate district attorney <i>or the United States attorney.</i>\" &#167; 13(h) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court rejected the motion court's implicit holding, concluding that IFB employees can not be \"government personnel,\" based primarily on a \"plain meaning\" reading of the term. Emphasizing that the IFB's funding comes entirely from two private associations of insurance companies and that the majority of its Board are not public officials, the court concluded that \"the IFB inhabits a region of the private/public spectrum that is much closer to a purely private agency.\" <i>See Pimental,</i> 199 F.R.D. at 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, there may well be instances in which an entity (or at least some of its employees) is considered governmental for a particular purpose despite the fact that it is both controlled and financed by private individuals. Even assuming that the IFB is completely controlled and financed by private insurance companies, that does not necessarily mean that its employees cannot be government personnel for purposes of Rule 6(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court's characterization of the IFB as entirely funded and controlled by private entities was incorrect. While it is true that the IFB's funding comes entirely from MWCRIB and AIB, two private associations of insurance companies, both of those associations are required by Massachusetts law to provide that funding. <i>See</i> st.1996, c. 427, &#167; 13(c); <i>see also Ellis,</i> 429 Mass. at 373 n. 16, 708 N.E.2d 644. This is not an instance in which private entities have voluntarily chosen to spend their resources on investigative personnel. <i>Cf. United States v. Tager,</i> 638 F.2d 167, 168 (10th Cir.1980) (where insurance companies voluntarily chose to fund an entity to investigate insurance fraud and completely controlled the scope of its actions, employees of the entity were not \"government personnel\" within the meaning of Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> If anything, the IFB's funding is more akin to a state-mandated tax on insurance companies than a voluntary expenditure by private entities. <i>Cf. Keller v. State Bar of Cal.,</i> 496 U.S. 1, 9-11, 110 S.Ct. 2228, 110 L.Ed.2d 1 (the mandatory charging of dues by the California Bar Association was state action that implicated First Amendment concerns). Indeed, the Supreme Judicial Court, the final arbiter on Massachusetts law, has explicitly found that \"insurance companies [cannot] control the [IFB] by withdrawing financial support\" even were they to attempt to forego the benefits of membership in the MWCRIB and AIB. If insurers withdrew from these organizations, \"the Legislature could easily amend the statute to base assessments on premiums written or on some other standard.\" <i>Ellis,</i> 429 Mass. at 373, 708 N.E.2d 644.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court's analysis also underestimates the full extent of the control that the Commonwealth exercises over the IFB. Although only a third of the IFB's board members are public officials, the IFB's purpose, organizational scheme, and basic operations are all dictated by statute. And while the IFB's day-to-day administration within the framework is, in large part, controlled by individuals who are not public officials, it is also subject to the constant oversight of the Massachusetts legislature, to which the IFB must submit a report every six months. &#167; 13(j).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the IFB was conceived of and authorized by statute as part of a larger scheme to curb insurance fraud, a matter of significant public concern, both at the state level, <i>see Ellis,</i> 429 Mass. at 365, 708 N.E.2d 644, and nationally, <i>see United States v. Hurn,</i> 368 F.3d 1359 (11th Cir.2004) (affirming federal conviction for workers' compensation fraud); <i>United States v. Fore,</i> 169 F.3d 104 (2d Cir.1999) (same). The IFB was also given significant powers to achieve this goal, including access to various state records that are not normally available to private entities and the right to review all suspicions of fraud within the insurance companies. <i>See</i> st.1996, c. 427, &#167;&#167; 13(d) &amp; (e). It also has the affirmative obligation to report suspicions of fraud when they are sufficiently corroborated. &#167; 13(h).

As such, the text of the Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) itself provides little guidance on whether IFB employees can be characterized as \"government personnel\" within the meaning of the Rule. Neither this Court nor any other federal circuit court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> has previously addressed whether IFB employees, or similar quasi-state-government employees, fall within the term \"government personnel\" in Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Given the lack of either a clear textual resolution or of controlling authority, we turn to the history of the Rule and its purpose in allowing disclosure only to \"government personnel\" but not others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(C) <i>History and Purpose of the Exception to Grand Jury Secrecy in Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii).</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before 1977, Rule 6(e) did not permit the disclosure of grand jury materials to government employees who were not attorneys. <i>Sells Eng'g,</i> 463 U.S. at 436, 103 S.Ct. 3133. Over time, the lack of such a provision became \"something of a problem in practice, because Justice Department attorneys found that they often needed active assistance from outside personnel &#8212; not only investigators from the FBI, IRS, and other law enforcement agencies, but also accountants, handwriting experts, and other persons with special skills.\" <i>Id.</i> In response to this concern, the Advisory Committee on Rules suggested amending Rule 6(e) to allow disclosure to non-attorney government personnel. <i>See id.</i> at 436-37, 103 S.Ct. 3133.

The principle of grand jury secrecy would be severely compromised, the objection went, if government agencies such as the IRS could indirectly use materials collected by the grand jury to help prosecute a civil case against an accused. <i>See id.</i> Most law-makers, it appears, agreed with the basic principle that grand jury materials \"should be available to `every legitimate member of [the] team' conducting the criminal investigation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 439, 103 S.Ct. 3133 (quoting the testimony of Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, testifying before the House on behalf of the Justice Department).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Precisely who was a \"legitimate member\" of the prosecution team was also a subject of some discussion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Rep.

In some instances, federal prosecutors temporarily hired outside experts to assist in the prosecution of a case. Recognizing the import of sharing grand jury materials with such temporary employees, two circuit courts held that such temporary employees were indeed \"government personnel\" within the meaning of the Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii). <i>United States v. Anderson,</i> 778 F.2d 602, 605 (10th Cir.1985) (an expert witness on trust law); <i>United States v. Lartey,</i> 716 F.2d 955, 963-64 (2d Cir.1983) (a retired I.R.S. agent). Federal prosecutors also occasionally sought the assistance of state and local employees, attempting to share secret grand jury materials with them. The district courts' responses to such efforts were more mixed. <i>Compare In re Grand Jury Proceedings,</i> 445 F.Supp. 349, 350 (D.R.I.1978) (state and local personnel are not within the exception for government personnel in the Rule); <i>with In re 1979 Grand Jury Proceedings,</i> 479 F.Supp. 93, 95-96 (E.D.N.Y.1979) (state and local personnel included).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Partially in response, Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) was amended in 1985 to include expressly personnel \"of a state or state subdivision\" within the term \"government personnel.\" <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. Rule 6, advisory committee's notes on 1985 amendments. \"It is clearly desirable,\" the Committee wrote, \"that federal and state authorities cooperate, as they often do\" in complex cases such as \"major fraud cases\" and that federal prosecutors have access to \"the assistance of state law enforcement personnel, which could be uniquely beneficial.\" <i>Id.</i> Although increased disclosure was obviously in tension with the general rule of grand jury secrecy, the Committee \"emphasized that the disclosure permitted is limited\": it is permissible only \"in connection with the attorney for the government's `duty to enforce criminal law' and only to those personnel `deemed necessary ... to assist' in the performance of that duty.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two important themes, for our purposes, can be discerned from this legislative history. First, a key purpose of Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) is to facilitate cooperation between federal prosecutors and state personnel, who often are uniquely situated to assist in the investigation and prosecution of federal criminal cases. When court decisions tended to limit the potential for such cooperation because of concerns that state officials, who are not under the control of the federal government, could not be entrusted with grand jury materials, they were explicitly overruled by Congress. Thus, Congress made a conscious decision to entrust certain state, as well as federal, personnel with information concerning matters before a grand jury under certain conditions. Second, a primary safeguard for protecting the countervailing interest in the secrecy of grand jury proceedings is the requirement that such disclosure must be necessary for the enforcement of criminal law. Although the Rule's limitation to \"government personnel\" also helps to assure the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, that limit was not contemplated by either Congress in 1977 or the Advisory Committee in 1985 as the primary mechanism for doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These themes convince us that the exception in Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) may cover the unique quasi-governmental investigators of the IFB, depending on the facts of the situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In many instances of insurance fraud in Massachusetts, IFB investigators, rather than members of a more classic state law enforcement agency, will be the individuals who will have the most in-depth knowledge of that fraud. This is a direct result of the way in which Massachusetts has chosen to structure its investigations into such matters. Congress clearly desired that Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) would allow federal prosecutors to take advantage of the state's investigative processes when such cooperation was necessary to prosecute federal crimes such as mail fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, by specifically including state personnel in Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii), Congress chose to trust state officials that the state itself had entrusted with the investigation of criminal matters. Here, Massachusetts has given the hybrid private/public IFB significant powers and responsibilities. In the course of their initial investigations, IFB investigators have access to non-public information that is not normally available to private investigators. &#167; 13(d). If that investigation leads the IFB executive director to refer the case to the Attorney General's Office, the IFB investigator initially assigned to the case provides significant support to the prosecuting attorney. <i>See Commonwealth v. Harwood,</i> 432 Mass. 290, 299, 733 N.E.2d 547 (2000) (\"[I]t has been customary for principal investigators from the IFB to provide ongoing investigatory support for the Attorney General's subsequent inquiries.\"). Moreover, in state criminal prosecutions the state considers IFB agents to be assistants to prosecutors: \"for the purposes of preserving potentially exculpatory evidence,\" the IFB is \"under the general supervisory umbrella of the office of the prosecutor.\" <i>Id.</i> at 300, 733 N.E.2d 547. Consequently, exculpatory evidence that IFB investigators lose can be attributed to the prosecution. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not know the many factual variations that could be presented by use of IFB personnel on federal criminal investigative teams; we do not hold that all IFB personnel are qualified as a matter of status. Because the interest in the secrecy of grand jury proceedings is intense, this is not an area for categorical approvals tied to labels. The mere fact that a person works for the IFB does not mean that he or she fits the definition for government personnel within Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For this reason, we do not consider that the prosecution has self-executing powers under Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) simply to designate IFB personnel as recipients of grand jury material. Rather, the prosecutor must seek court authorization where quasi-governmental agencies such as the IFB are involved and make a functional showing that the individual involved is within the Rule. In the past, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts has chosen to seek court authorization first, on a case-by-case basis whenever it wishes IFB personnel to be involved. It should continue to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's grant of the Rule 29 motion is <i>reversed.</i> The denial of the motion to dismiss the indictment is <i>affirmed</i> and the renewal of that motion is <i>denied.</i> The case is remanded to the district court for sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> All subsequent references to premium rates are per hundred dollars of payroll</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Indeed, Pimental stresses on appeal that it is possible that he actually lost money from misrepresenting the type of operations his company performed, because some of those operations were cheaper to insure than was concrete rebar</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> As recounted in Part I, there was significant evidence that, in addition to lying about the nature of Pimental Steel's operations, Pimental also lied about the size of the company's payroll.

There was more than sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Pimental did indeed misrepresent the size of Pimental Steel's payroll in an effort to defraud the insurance companies. Nonetheless, in order to simplify the analysis of whether Count Four was in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, <i>see infra</i> Part III.B.ii., we focus on Pimental's misrepresentations concerning the nature of Pimental Steel's operations.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> As Pimental does not raise this issue, we do not address it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The flexibility of the English language is one of its wonders; that flexibility can lead to misunderstandings<i>Pacheco-Ortiz</i> simply said that \"for the mailings to be considered in furtherance of the scheme, the scheme's completion or the prevention of its detection must have <i>depended in some way</i> on the mailings.\" 889 F.2d at 305 (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added).

The bankruptcy court's subsequent mailings of the statement to the corporation's creditors formed the basis for the defendant's convictions. <i>Id.</i> at 60. In responding to Bruckman's causation argument, the court held that it was not necessary for the bankruptcy court's mailings to the company's creditors to have been reasonably foreseeable. Rather, it was sufficient that there \"was ample evidence from which the jury could conclude both that Bruckman participated in the scheme to defraud, and that <i>some use of the mails</i> was to be anticipated in the course of such scheme.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Because the \"jury could reasonably infer that mailings would be foreseeable in the course of the bankruptcy reorganization proceedings related to the intended acquisition of [the corporation] by Bruckman and others,\" there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude \"that Bruckman knowingly caused the mailings\" at issue. <i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Pimental also relies on<i>United States v.

The government appeals the district court's dismissal of two counts on which a jury had convicted, while the defendant cross-appeals on the ground that the entire case should have been dismissed because of an alleged violation of the grand jury secrecy rule, embodied in Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e). We conclude, despite the able representation of Pimental, that (1) the district court erred in dismissing the two counts and we reinstate the jury convictions and conclude that (2) there was no violation by the prosecution here of Rule 6(e) at all. This second point is a matter of first impression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a jury convicted Arthur Pimental of two counts of mail fraud, the district court dismissed the convictions because it found that the two underlying mailings were not \"in furtherance\" of Pimental's fraudulent scheme. <i>United States v.

Pimental's scheme involved lying to various workers' compensation insurance company representatives about the nature and scope of his company's work; his false statements tended to reduce the premium payments he owed for workers' compensation insurance. The government appeals the district court's decision, arguing that the two mailings furthered Pimental's scheme by helping to ensure that the insurance company did not discover his earlier misrepresentations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental cross-appeals, arguing that his indictment should be dismissed because the prosecuting attorney disclosed secret grand jury materials to an investigator for the Massachusetts Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB). Pimental argues that the rule allowing disclosure of grand jury materials to \"government personnel\" in certain circumstances, Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(a)(ii), was inapplicable because the IFB investigator was a private actor. The IFB, which investigates potential cases of insurance fraud, is authorized and structured by Massachusetts statute, but partially run and entirely funded by insurers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse the district court's dismissal of Pimental's convictions, finding that the mailings by insurance company representatives that formed the basis of the two counts of conviction were indeed in furtherance of Pimental's fraudulent scheme. Additionally, we reject Pimental's cross-appeal because we conclude that the first district court (not the trial court) did not err when it found the IFB investigators here are \"government personnel\" within the meaning of Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) and so authorized the prosecutor to reveal grand jury materials to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are described in the light most favorable to the jury's guilty verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arthur Pimental and his wife, Loretta Pimental (for ease of reference we refer to her as Loretta and to Arthur as Pimental), owned and operated Pimental Steel Erectors (\"Pimental Steel\") starting sometime in the early 1980's. In late 1989, Pimental Steel allowed its workers' compensation insurance to lapse; this violated Massachusetts law. Massachusetts requires all employers to maintain workers' compensation insurance which covers their employees in the case of an on-the-job injury or job-related illness. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 152, &#167; 25A. Over three years later, in April 1993, Arthur Pimental mailed a written application to the Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau (MWCRIB) to resume Pimental Steel's workers' compensation coverage. MWCRIB, a private non-profit association of insurers that is licensed under Massachusetts law, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 152. &#167; 52C, uses a risk pool to assign insurance companies to provide workers' compensation insurance on pre-set terms to applicant-employers. The fraud charges started here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the MWCRIB application form, Pimental described the operations of his business as involving \"concrete construction incl[uding] foundations\" and added that it \"puts in foundations.\" Concrete foundation work involves laying concrete and reinforcing it with steel rods and is also known as \"rebar.\" MWCRIB processed the application, assigned it to the Hartford Fire Insurance Company (\"Hartford Insurance\"), and notified Pimental via the mail that the estimated premium for the year, based on his application, was $12,425.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite what was said in the MWCRIB application, Pimental Steel had never at any point been involved in concrete foundation work. Rather, throughout the relevant period, its business performed mainly steel erection and related work, such as welding and decking. Steel erection involves the placement of girders, columns, and joints to support a structure, then laying corrugated-metal decking for the ceiling and floors of the building and welding it into place. Steel erection work carries a significantly higher risk of injury than does concrete foundation work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because workers' compensation premiums are set based upon the kind of work performed and the amount of a business's payroll, Pimental's incorrect description on the MWCRIB application affected the premium payments Pimental Steel owed. In 1993, the premium payment for steel erection of structures over two stories was $99.35 per every hundred dollars of payroll<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> (reduced to $69.22 for structures under two stories), while the rate was $41.22 for concrete foundation work. Some of the work that Pimental Steel actually performed, however, had <i>lower</i> premium rates than concrete foundation work: the rate for decking was $24.66 or $19.82, depending on the type of metal used, while the rate for welding was $23.56. Where, as in the case of Pimental Steel, employees perform tasks that have different premium rates, the total premium cost can be calculated by parsing out the hours that employees spent on each different task, so long as appropriate documentation is maintained. One witness testified that 80% of the work Pimental Steel did for him was steel erection and decking and that the remaining 20% was \"miscellaneous.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September of 1993, Joseph F. Brugman, an auditor for Hartford Insurance, met with Loretta Pimental to perform an initial audit on Pimental Steel's insurance application. In addition to such initial audits, which are conducted at the start of an insurer's relationship with an insured, insurers normally perform audits once a year at the conclusion of each annual policy period. The auditors determine the insurance classification for the work that the insured's employees performed and the total amount of salary paid to them. Using this information, the insurance companies calculate the final amount that the employer owes for the year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the initial audit meeting, Loretta told Brugman that Pimental Steel was, as the MWCRIB application had represented, involved in concrete foundation work. She did not tell Brugman that Pimental Steel was involved in any way in steel erection, welding, or decking, even though Brugman explained to her that Pimental Steel's operations could be split into different classifications for insurance purposes. At the later year-end audit in July 1994, also conducted by Brugman, Loretta repeated this description of Pimental Steel's business operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months after Brugman conducted his year-end audit, William Brooks, a loss-control inspector for Hartford Insurance, met with Arthur Pimental. In contrast to auditors, the purpose of loss-control inspectors is not to verify the accuracy of the information given by policyholders, but instead to \"assist[] policyholders in their efforts to control costly accidents and/or injuries.\" During that meeting Pimental once again represented, wrongly, that his business involved rebar. Pimental also told Brooks that he did not currently have any employees and that there were not any ongoing projects that Brooks could observe. This was also not true: Pimental paid an employee wages three days after his meeting with Brugman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 5, 1994, Brooks mailed an \"Account Data Report\" to Hartford Insurance that summarized his meeting with Pimental. The letter began by stating that \"[t]he insured describes his business [ ]as that of the installation of reenforcing bars and rods for floors and walls.\" Brooks's standard practice is to inform insureds that he will turn over a copy of his loss-control report to the insurance company, and that the company will inform the employer of any recommendations to improve worker safety. However, Brooks testified that he had no specific recollection of whether he had informed Pimental of this procedure during their meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pimentals renewed their workers' compensation insurance coverage with Hartford Insurance in May 1995. Hartford sent them a letter detailing the terms of coverage; under the heading \"Business of Named Insured,\" the letter read \"concrete construction.\" In July 1995, Hartford auditor Mark Lawrence met with Loretta Pimental to conduct an audit of the May 1994 to May 1995 policy period. During that meeting, Lawrence asked Loretta if the company did any steel erection work, given that the company's name is \"Pimental Steel Erectors.\" Loretta responded that the company only did concrete rebar work, and did not work on steel erection, despite its name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawrence also asked Loretta for documentation of Pimental Steel's wage payments to employees. Loretta told Lawrence that there was no single record detailing payroll. Instead, she provided him with a checkbook that had been used to make payroll payments, along with a written summary of that checkbook, and told him that there were no additional records. From these documents, Lawrence calculated that Pimental Steel had paid $28,885 in salary to its employees for the year from May 1994 to May 1995, resulting in a total premium of $13,586. In fact, Pimental Steel's actual payroll during that period was $85,499, a figure which would have led to a larger premium. The Pimentals used non-sequentially numbered checks in their business and it appears that the single checkbook given to Lawrence contained only a fraction of all the checks written on behalf of Pimental Steel from the previous year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1995, Hartford Insurance attempted to arrange another loss-control meeting with Arthur Pimental. After Pimental did not respond to three separate inquiries, Timothy Bergeron, a Senior Loss-Control Consultant for Hartford Insurance, sent him a final letter stating that \"failure to allow reasonable access for the purpose of loss-control consultation is a violation of the good faith provisions in the Workers' Compensation Insurance Plan and can subject your policy to cancellation.\" Under that threat of cancellation, Pimental finally met with Bergeron on September 21, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the meeting, Pimental told Bergeron that Pimental Steel continued to perform rebar work; he falsely said the company did not perform any structural steel erection or metal deck work. He also falsely told Bergeron that there were currently no jobs in progress that could be inspected. His bank records reveal, however, that three employees were paid their wages that same day. During the meeting, Bergeron told Pimental that he was going to prepare a report summarizing their meeting and would mail it to Hartford Insurance. Bergeron testified that he told Pimental that he would send the loss-control report to Hartford Insurance, and Brooks indicated that it was his standard practice to tell the insured that the loss-control report would be forwarded to the insurance company. Bergeron kept a copy of the report in Hartford Insurance's Boston branch (where he was stationed) and sent a copy to the company's branch in San Antonio, Texas \"that issues the policy and distributes all the policies regarding the assigned risk pool.\" On October 5, 1995, Bergeron also mailed a letter to Pimental summarizing their meeting and stating that \"[y]our company continues to bid work as a subcontractor installing reinforcement bar.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental again renewed the company's workers' compensation insurance in May 1996, and Hartford Insurance again mailed a letter to Pimental detailing the coverage and repeating that the nature of the company's business was \"concrete construction.\" Later that summer, Lawrence wrote a letter to the Pimentals requesting certain documents that were needed to perform a year-end audit for the May 1995-to-May 1996 coverage period. The Pimentals never provided Lawrence with any of the requested documentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Lawrence met with Loretta Pimental for the annual audit on August 9, 1996, the only documentation that she provided was Pimental Steel's checkbook; she claimed to have been unaware of the records Lawrence had requested and to have lost the letter he had sent to her. As a result, Lawrence determined that Pimental Steel's account was \"unauditable\" and his report to Hartford Insurance simply estimated a payroll of $31,500 based on the checkbook that Loretta had provided. This estimate was less than 20% of Pimental Steel's actual payroll of $158,653 for that time period. Consequently, the $19,374 in premiums that the Pimentals were charged was also less than 20% of what they actually owed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1996, Arthur Pimental, perhaps concerned that Hartford Insurance might cancel Pimental Steel's policy for failure to provide requested documentation, submitted a second application for workers' compensation insurance to MWCRIB. This application contained a new name for the company; it was now called A.P.S. Products, Inc., rather than Pimental Steel Erectors. (We continue to refer to Pimental's company as \"Pimental Steel\" despite this name change). The application once again described the company's operations as \"[i]nstall steel for concrete reinforcement,\" and stated that its total payroll was $65,000 per year and that it employed only two workers. During the previous six months, the Pimentals' company actually paid salary to between four and seven employees on a weekly basis, and the company's payroll for those six months totaled approximately $83,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MWCRIB assigned the insurance application to Employers Insurance of Wausau (Wausau Insurance) and sent a letter to Pimental informing him of the assignment and stating that the estimated premium was $37,600. The Pimentals then began a pattern of deception with Wausau Insurance similar to that employed with Hartford Insurance. Arthur told auditors for Wausau Insurance that A.P.S. Products did concrete rebar construction rather than the steel erection, welding, or decking work that it actually performed. Loretta, in turn, initially provided Wausau Insurance with incomplete records that significantly underrepresented the company's payroll.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of a block transfer of policies, MWCRIB reassigned the Pimentals' insurance coverage from Wausau Insurance to Savers Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company (\"Savers Insurance\") in October of 1997. Using the 1996 MWCRIB application as well as Wausau's most recent policy, Savers Insurance initially calculated a $33,671 yearly premium based on a $65,000 payroll in concrete rebar. Once again, the Pimentals misrepresented the nature of their business to Savers Insurance. Arthur Pimental told a loss-control inspector for Savers Insurance that his company only worked on concrete rebar. Further, the Pimentals failed to respond to several inquiries from Savers Insurance auditors, resulting in Savers Insurance using a 50% increased payroll figure of $97,500 for the 1997-to-1998 coverage period. This was still substantially smaller than the actual payroll figure of $168,162.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In total, from October 1993 to August 1998, the Pimentals paid their employees approximately $738,000 in salary. The insurance premiums they paid during this period were based on a payroll of less than half that amount &#8212; about $340,000. Throughout the time period, the Pimentals paid premium rates for concrete rebar even though their work consisted almost entirely of steel erection, welding, and decking. Because different premium rates apply to each of these three activities and there was little evidence concerning how many employee hours were dedicated to each separate activity, the extent of the monetary benefit the Pimentals received from misrepresenting their business is unclear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> A jury could easily infer that the premiums would have been higher if Pimental had been honest in what he told his insurers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 29, 1999, Arthur and Loretta Pimental were each indicted on one conspiracy count, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, and fourteen counts of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341. Before trial, the Pimentals moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the government had violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e) when it disclosed, after earlier receiving permission from another judge on the court to do so, grand jury materials to an investigator for the Insurance Fraud Bureau of Massachusetts. <i>Pimental,</i> 236 F.Supp.2d at 103. In a trio of pretrial opinions, the district court held that there had been a Rule 6(e) violation (despite the prior approval of a different judge of the court), but held that the violation was harmless because the grand jury testimony that resulted from the transmittal of information to the IFB investigator was not crucial to the grand jury's decision to indict. <i>United States v.

After six days of testimony, a jury acquitted Loretta Pimental on all counts and acquitted Arthur Pimental on the conspiracy count and nine of the eleven mail fraud counts. The two mail fraud counts on which the jury convicted Arthur Pimental were both based on mailings sent by loss-control inspectors. The first count was premised on the October 5, 1994 mailing from William Brooks to Hartford Insurance, in which Brooks reported that Arthur Pimental had said that Pimental Steel Erectors only performed concrete rebar work. The second count was based on the letter from Timothy Bergeron to Arthur Pimental summarizing their meeting and noting that Pimental Steel was, according to Pimental, involved only in concrete rebar work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury returned its verdict, Arthur Pimental moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c).

But it nonetheless granted Pimental's Rule 29 motion because it concluded that there was not sufficient evidence that either mailing was in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme. <i>Id.</i> It also declined to rule on Pimental's renewed motion for dismissal of the indictment based on the Rule 6(e) violation, finding that this issue was mooted by its grant of the Rule 29 motion. <i>Id.</i> at 112.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appeals the district court's grant of the Rule 29 motion.

As to the \"in furtherance of\" requirement, the district court erred in holding that there was not sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the two loss-control inspectors' mailings were in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme. Accordingly, we reverse the grant of the Rule 29 motion and reinstate the convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Existence of a Scheme to Defraud</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental challenges the district court's conclusion that there was sufficient evidence of a scheme to defraud, hoping to knock out the convictions on grounds other than those relied upon by the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> First, he argues that the evidence at trial did not establish that Pimental Steel's employees were actually covered by workers' compensation insurance when they were performing steel erection. Pimental says the jury had no way of eliminating the possibility that if he had submitted a claim on behalf of an injured employee, the insurance company would have discovered the incorrect premium payments and thus refused to pay the employee. Pimental does not contest the district court's conclusion that, as a matter of Massachusetts law, the insurance company would be obliged to cover Pimental Steel's employees under such circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Pimental,</i> 236 F.Supp.2d at 106 (relying on <i>Employers Mutual Liability Insurance Co. of Wisconsin v. Merrimac Mills Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2233715\"><a href=\"/opinion/2233715/employers-mutual-liability-ins-co-v-merrimac-mills/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span>, 681, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2233715\"><a href=\"/opinion/2233715/employers-mutual-liability-ins-co-v-merrimac-mills/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span> (1950)). But he says that there was no evidentiary basis for <i>the jury</i> to reach this conclusion. From this premise, Pimental argues that the jury could not have found that the insurers suffered any loss as a result of Pimental's actions. And that, concludes Pimental, means that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that there existed a \"scheme to defraud.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental's argument goes too far. In order to find a \"scheme to defraud,\" the jury simply had to determine that Pimental was attempting to \"wrong[ ] one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes.\" <i>McNally v.

Here, there was more than sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Pimental lied about the nature of his company's work in order to pay cheaper premiums on his workers' compensation insurance. The jury easily could have concluded that Pimental was attempting to dishonestly minimize the insurance premiums to the company that he should have been paying under Massachusetts law. The speculative possibility that if an employee had filed a claim with Hartford Insurance, it would have discovered Pimental's lies and refused to pay the employee is irrelevant. To convict, the jury need not have drawn any additional conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental also argues that there was insufficient evidence of a scheme to defraud because the evidence was inconclusive as to whether he ultimately paid premiums that were less than what he actually owed, for the reasons discussed earlier. But whether Pimental actually paid more or less in premiums than he actually owed goes only to the success of his fraudulent scheme, not to its existence. <i>See United States v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199098\"><a href=\"/opinion/199098/united-states-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.2000) (success in scheme is not needed to support mail fraud conviction). In addition, the argument fails on its own terms. A rational jury could have found that Pimental, because of his own actions, did not in fact have the option of making variable premium payments according to the amount of time that his workers spent performing different job tasks. The evidence at trial established only that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The payroll of an individual employee may be divided and allocated to more than one classification, <i>provided the entries in the original records of the insured disclose an allocation of each such individual employee's payroll.</i> Any such operation for which separate payroll records are not maintained shall be assigned to the highest rated classification which applies to the job or location where the operation is performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). There was extensive testimony that the Pimentals specifically chose not to keep records documenting the breakdown of their employees' work and that they repeatedly misled the insurance company concerning their payroll in order to pay lower rates. A reasonable jury could have easily found that the Pimentals did not maintain \"separate payroll records\" and hence that the rate they should have paid, for all payroll hours, was the rate for steel erection. This would have been significantly more than the amount they actually paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The \"In Furtherance Of\" Requirement</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order for a mailing to be \"in furtherance\" of a fraudulent scheme, it \"must be for the purpose of executing the scheme,\" <i>United States v.

The jury was entitled to conclude that had Brooks never mailed his loss-control report, Hartford Insurance would have terminated its insurance coverage and Pimental's scheme would have, at least temporarily, come to a halt. Indeed, Pimental's policy with Hartford Insurance was threatened with cancellation when he attempted to avoid a loss-control interview in the summer of 1995 by ignoring repeated inquiries from Bergeron. If Hartford Insurance were not to receive a completed loss-control report, Bergeron's letter warned, Pimental's insurance coverage would be \"subject ... to cancellation.\" A rational jury could have readily found that the loss-control report from Brooks to Hartford Insurance furthered Pimental's fraudulent scheme because it was a necessary step in the continued relationship between Pimental and his victim, Hartford Insurance. <i>Cf.

The court interpreted this formulation to impose a \"but for\" test for the \"in furtherance of\" element of mail fraud &#8212; i.e. that a fraudulent scheme \"depends on\" a mailing only when but for that mailing, the scheme could not have succeeded or would have been discovered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The district court concluded that <i>Pacheco-Ortiz</i>'s use of \"depends on\" meant \"but-for\" despite language in <i>Pacheco-Ortiz</i> that also said that it was not necessary that each mailing guarantee the success of the scheme or even significantly advance it &#8212; that it only need be closely related to the scheme. 889 F.2d at 305.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying its approach, the district court found that there was no evidence that, absent the mailing of the loss-control report, Hartford would necessarily have uncovered the scheme and terminated Pimental's coverage. Although the court noted that it was possible that a loss-control report describing the Pimentals' business as steel erection \"might have raised an eyebrow\" at the insurance company, it concluded that the government did not present sufficient evidence on this point; the evidence did not demonstrate that \"the jig would have been up\" had Brooks's loss-control report stated that the Pimentals' business was steel erection. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's search for a direct, but-for, link between Brooks's mailing and the fraudulent element of Pimental's scheme &#8212; the claim that his business involved concrete rebar and not steel erection &#8212; misapprehended the law in two ways. First, a mail fraud conviction does not require the existence of a \"but-for\" link between the mailing and the fraud, or its cover-up. Such a rule would harken back to the oft-rejected notion that the mailing needs to be connected with the essence of the fraud. It need not be, so long as it is \"incident to an essential element of the fraud.\" <i>See Schmuck</i> at 710-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112222\"><a href=\"/opinion/112222/schmuck-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1443</span></a></span>. For instance, in <i>Schmuck</i> itself there was no but-for relationship between the success of the scheme and the mailing of the title-application form. Schmuck could have continued selling cars that had been tampered with even if the dealerships that bought those cars did not mail the title-application forms. The mailings were nonetheless \"in furtherance\" of the scheme because they contributed to its overall success by making it more likely that dealerships would come back to Schmuck to purchase more cars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, mailings that are designed to \"lull the victims into a false sense of security, postpone their ultimate complaint to the authorities, and therefore make the apprehension of the defendant[ ] <i>less likely</i> than if no mailings had taken place\" are sufficient under the statute. <i>United States v.

Preventing the detection of an ongoing or a completed fraudulent scheme is not contingent on lulling the victim into a false sense of security. Instead, lulling the victim into a false sense of security <i>contributes to</i> the prevention of the scheme's detection by making detection of the scheme less likely. This is sufficient to satisfy the \"in furtherance of\" requirement of the mail fraud statute. <i>See, e.g., McCann,</i> 366 F.3d at 53 (letter sent after the culmination of the fraud was in furtherance of fraud because it \"served the important purpose of decreasing the risk of detection\"); <i>Lopez,</i> 71 F.3d at 956-57, 961 (fax sent two years after culmination of fraud that attempted to explain certain documents that were submitted to cover-up the illegal withdrawal was in furtherance of fraudulent scheme in wire fraud conviction because it made defendant's apprehension less likely); <i>United States v.

In fact, even under the district court's overly stringent and incorrect but-for test, the jury would have been entitled to conclude that Pimental's scheme depended on Brooks's mailing. The reason is that the success of the scheme did not simply depend on Pimental lying about the nature of his business's operations &#8212; it also depended, among other things, on the mailing and processing of loss-control reports. Were those reports not mailed, there was significant evidence that Hartford Insurance would have cancelled the Pimentals' coverage. One of the central points of <i>Schmuck</i> is that a mailing that is itself innocent and that seems to accomplish an innocent end can nonetheless be in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) <i>Count Four Conviction &#8212; Bergeron's Mailing to Pimental</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second Count on which Pimental was convicted is premised on Bergeron's mailing to Pimental himself of a summary of the loss-control interview. In this mailing, Bergeron states, based on what Pimental said in the interview, that Pimental's business continued to be the installation of concrete reinforcement bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental argues that whether he received a summary of his meeting with Bergeron was immaterial to whether Hartford Insurance would continue to provide the Pimentals with insurance for their employees at the incorrect rate. Pimental also argues that lying to loss-control inspectors as opposed to lying to auditors was not an essential part of the scheme. This was particularly so, says Pimental, because the evidence was that the loss-control division of Hartford Insurance was entirely separate from the division that set premiums and investigated fraud. Indeed, Brooks was not even an employee of Hartford Insurance, but was instead an independent contractor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury easily could have concluded that Pimental needed to be or thought he needed to be consistent in his lies to representatives of the insurer, regardless of who the representative was. It is not hard to infer that an inconsistent report from a loss-control inspector could somehow trigger alarms in the premium setting group. The harder question is why a letter <i>to Pimental,</i> recounting his fraudulent statements, was in furtherance of the fraud. There are several responses. One is that Pimental now knew that his deception of the inspector was successful &#8212; his copy showed that his lies were being sent to the company records. This could only encourage him in the scheme. Further, there was an obvious purpose to Bergeron sending a summary of his report to Pimental &#8212; it allowed Pimental to correct any inaccurate information on the report. Pimental chose not to correct the misinformation, thus perpetuating the fraud and demonstrating further his fraudulent intent. <i>See United States v. Morrow,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195715\"><a href=\"/opinion/195715/united-states-v-morrow/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1228</span></a></span>, 1236-37 (1st Cir.1994) (in insurance fraud scheme, the insurance company's mailing to the insured acknowledging that it had received the fraudulent claim was, under the <i>Schmuck</i> formulation, \"`incidental' to an essential element in the scheme\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(C) <i>Causation: Were the Mailings Reasonably Foreseeable?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that he \"caused\" either of the mailings at issue because neither of them was reasonably foreseeable. <i>See Pereira,</i> 347 U.S. at 8-9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105186\"><a href=\"/opinion/105186/pereira-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>. There was no evidence, according to Pimental, of a \"course of business\" between himself and his insurers that would have led a reasonable person to have anticipated either of the mailings that formed the basis for his convictions. He points to evidence that Brooks could not recall ever telling Pimental that the loss-control report would be mailed to Hartford Insurance. Similarly, Bergeron testified only that he told Pimental that he would send the loss-control report to Hartford, not that he would send it to Pimental himself. All of this, concludes Pimental, means there was no way that he could reasonably foresee that either Brooks's or Bergeron's letters would ever be written or mailed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental's arguments are premised on an incorrect understanding of the law. As the district court correctly held, it is simply the \"use of the mails\" in the course of the scheme rather than the particular mailing at issue that must be reasonably foreseeable for the causation element of a mail fraud offense to be satisfied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Morrow,</i> 39 F.3d at 1237 (all that is required to show causation is that the defendant \"participated in a crime in which it was foreseeable ... that the mails would be used\" and that was satisfied where defendant \"admitted at trial that he knew that automobile insurance claims are processed in part through the use of the mails\"); <i>Bruckman,</i> 874 F.2d at 60 (\"[T]he causation element is met as long as some use of the mails was reasonably to be anticipated in the course of the scheme.\"); <i>Fermin Castillo,</i> 829 F.2d at 1198 (\"As long as some use of the instrumentality in the course of the endeavor was reasonably to be anticipated, the causation requirement is met.\"); <i>see also United States v.

Rather than focus on the predictability of specific mailings in the indictment, the <i>Walters</i> court thus premised its analysis on the question of whether the use of the mails, as a general matter, was a foreseeable component of the scheme to defraud. <i>See id.</i> at 1223-24. Indeed, in the course of its analysis, the court noted that insurance fraud is the \"paradigm\" case in which the use of the mails is reasonably foreseeable because the payment and submission of insurance claims typically involves mailings between the insurance company's agents and the insured. <i>See id.</i> at 1223.

The exception allows disclosure of grand jury materials to \"any government personnel &#8212; including those of a state or state subdivision\" when such disclosure is necessary to prosecute a criminal case. Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(A)(ii). The district court motion judge, who was not the trial judge, granted the motion without opinion. No disclosure was made by the prosecutor without court permission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, during pretrial discovery, Pimental moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the government had violated Rule 6(e) when it disclosed to Scott Faragi, an IFB investigator who later testified before the grand jury, Pimental's bank records and other material that had been obtained through the grand jury's subpoena powers. Pimental argued that IFB agents such as Faragi were not \"government personnel\" within the meaning of Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii), and thus the exception to grand jury secrecy was not applicable and the earlier district court order was wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the trial court held that IFB investigators can not be \"government personnel\" within the meaning of Rule 6(e), and thus that the earlier ruling allowing the prosecutor to disclose grand jury materials to IFB investigators was in error. <i>Pimental,</i> 199 F.R.D. at 33-37 (D.Mass.2001); <i>Pimental,</i> 201 F.R.D. at 25-26. It did not hold that because the disclosure had been authorized by the court, there could be no dismissal of the indictment. Rather, the district court refused to dismiss Pimental's indictment because the \"error\" did not substantially affect the grand jury's decision to indict, and thus it was harmless. <i>Pimental,</i> 204 F.R.D. at 227-28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pimental now challenges this pre-trial denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment. He also asks this court to consider his post-trial renewal of that motion, which the district court found to be moot due to its grant of Pimental's Rule 29 motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the first district court's implicit conclusion that IFB agents are \"government personnel &#8212; including those of a state or state subdivision\" within the meaning of Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) was, on these facts, not error. We do not hold that all IFB employees, regardless of the circumstances, are government personnel, but only that here that decision was correct.

The authorizing statute requires that the MWCRIB and AIB each fund half of the IFB's budget, &#167; 13(c), and each provide the IFB with five of its fifteen Board members, &#167; 13(a). The remaining five IFB Board members are Massachusetts public officials. &#167; 13(a). Under the statutory scheme, every insurer \"having reason to believe that an insurance transaction is fraudulent\" must advise the IFB of its suspicions. &#167; 13(e). The IFB, in turn, is required to review those cases and investigate further when necessary. &#167; 13(f). Where the IFB's executive director \"is satisfied that a material fraud, deceit, or intentional misrepresentation has been committed in an insurance transaction,\" he must \"refer the matter to the attorney general, the appropriate district attorney <i>or the United States attorney.</i>\" &#167; 13(h) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court rejected the motion court's implicit holding, concluding that IFB employees can not be \"government personnel,\" based primarily on a \"plain meaning\" reading of the term. Emphasizing that the IFB's funding comes entirely from two private associations of insurance companies and that the majority of its Board are not public officials, the court concluded that \"the IFB inhabits a region of the private/public spectrum that is much closer to a purely private agency.\" <i>See Pimental,</i> 199 F.R.D. at 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, there may well be instances in which an entity (or at least some of its employees) is considered governmental for a particular purpose despite the fact that it is both controlled and financed by private individuals.

While it is true that the IFB's funding comes entirely from MWCRIB and AIB, two private associations of insurance companies, both of those associations are required by Massachusetts law to provide that funding. <i>See</i> st.1996, c. 427, &#167; 13(c); <i>see also Ellis,</i> 429 Mass. at 373 n. 16, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></span>.

Indeed, the Supreme Judicial Court, the final arbiter on Massachusetts law, has explicitly found that \"insurance companies [cannot] control the [IFB] by withdrawing financial support\" even were they to attempt to forego the benefits of membership in the MWCRIB and AIB. If insurers withdrew from these organizations, \"the Legislature could easily amend the statute to base assessments on premiums written or on some other standard.\" <i>Ellis,</i> 429 Mass. at 373, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court's analysis also underestimates the full extent of the control that the Commonwealth exercises over the IFB. Although only a third of the IFB's board members are public officials, the IFB's purpose, organizational scheme, and basic operations are all dictated by statute. And while the IFB's day-to-day administration within the framework is, in large part, controlled by individuals who are not public officials, it is also subject to the constant oversight of the Massachusetts legislature, to which the IFB must submit a report every six months. &#167; 13(j).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the IFB was conceived of and authorized by statute as part of a larger scheme to curb insurance fraud, a matter of significant public concern, both at the state level, <i>see Ellis,</i> 429 Mass. at 365, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></span>, and nationally, <i>see United States v.

The IFB was also given significant powers to achieve this goal, including access to various state records that are not normally available to private entities and the right to review all suspicions of fraud within the insurance companies. <i>See</i> st.1996, c. 427, &#167;&#167; 13(d) &amp; (e).

As such, the text of the Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) itself provides little guidance on whether IFB employees can be characterized as \"government personnel\" within the meaning of the Rule. Neither this Court nor any other federal circuit court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> has previously addressed whether IFB employees, or similar quasi-state-government employees, fall within the term \"government personnel\" in Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Given the lack of either a clear textual resolution or of controlling authority, we turn to the history of the Rule and its purpose in allowing disclosure only to \"government personnel\" but not others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(C) <i>History and Purpose of the Exception to Grand Jury Secrecy in Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii).</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before 1977, Rule 6(e) did not permit the disclosure of grand jury materials to government employees who were not attorneys. <i>Sells Eng'g,</i> 463 U.S. at 436, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111004\"><a href=\"/opinion/111004/united-states-v-sells-engineering-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rule 6, advisory committee's notes on 1985 amendments. \"It is clearly desirable,\" the Committee wrote, \"that federal and state authorities cooperate, as they often do\" in complex cases such as \"major fraud cases\" and that federal prosecutors have access to \"the assistance of state law enforcement personnel, which could be uniquely beneficial.\" <i>Id.</i> Although increased disclosure was obviously in tension with the general rule of grand jury secrecy, the Committee \"emphasized that the disclosure permitted is limited\": it is permissible only \"in connection with the attorney for the government's `duty to enforce criminal law' and only to those personnel `deemed necessary ... to assist' in the performance of that duty.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two important themes, for our purposes, can be discerned from this legislative history. First, a key purpose of Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) is to facilitate cooperation between federal prosecutors and state personnel, who often are uniquely situated to assist in the investigation and prosecution of federal criminal cases. When court decisions tended to limit the potential for such cooperation because of concerns that state officials, who are not under the control of the federal government, could not be entrusted with grand jury materials, they were explicitly overruled by Congress. Thus, Congress made a conscious decision to entrust certain state, as well as federal, personnel with information concerning matters before a grand jury under certain conditions. Second, a primary safeguard for protecting the countervailing interest in the secrecy of grand jury proceedings is the requirement that such disclosure must be necessary for the enforcement of criminal law. Although the Rule's limitation to \"government personnel\" also helps to assure the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, that limit was not contemplated by either Congress in 1977 or the Advisory Committee in 1985 as the primary mechanism for doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These themes convince us that the exception in Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) may cover the unique quasi-governmental investigators of the IFB, depending on the facts of the situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In many instances of insurance fraud in Massachusetts, IFB investigators, rather than members of a more classic state law enforcement agency, will be the individuals who will have the most in-depth knowledge of that fraud. This is a direct result of the way in which Massachusetts has chosen to structure its investigations into such matters. Congress clearly desired that Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) would allow federal prosecutors to take advantage of the state's investigative processes when such cooperation was necessary to prosecute federal crimes such as mail fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, by specifically including state personnel in Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii), Congress chose to trust state officials that the state itself had entrusted with the investigation of criminal matters. Here, Massachusetts has given the hybrid private/public IFB significant powers and responsibilities. In the course of their initial investigations, IFB investigators have access to non-public information that is not normally available to private investigators. &#167; 13(d). If that investigation leads the IFB executive director to refer the case to the Attorney General's Office, the IFB investigator initially assigned to the case provides significant support to the prosecuting attorney. <i>See Commonwealth v. Harwood,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></span>, 299, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span> (2000) (\"[I]t has been customary for principal investigators from the IFB to provide ongoing investigatory support for the Attorney General's subsequent inquiries.\"). Moreover, in state criminal prosecutions the state considers IFB agents to be assistants to prosecutors: \"for the purposes of preserving potentially exculpatory evidence,\" the IFB is \"under the general supervisory umbrella of the office of the prosecutor.\" <i>Id.</i> at 300, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span>. Consequently, exculpatory evidence that IFB investigators lose can be attributed to the prosecution. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not know the many factual variations that could be presented by use of IFB personnel on federal criminal investigative teams; we do not hold that all IFB personnel are qualified as a matter of status. Because the interest in the secrecy of grand jury proceedings is intense, this is not an area for categorical approvals tied to labels. The mere fact that a person works for the IFB does not mean that he or she fits the definition for government personnel within Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For this reason, we do not consider that the prosecution has self-executing powers under Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) simply to designate IFB personnel as recipients of grand jury material. Rather, the prosecutor must seek court authorization where quasi-governmental agencies such as the IFB are involved and make a functional showing that the individual involved is within the Rule. In the past, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts has chosen to seek court authorization first, on a case-by-case basis whenever it wishes IFB personnel to be involved.

In responding to Bruckman's causation argument, the court held that it was not necessary for the bankruptcy court's mailings to the company's creditors to have been reasonably foreseeable. Rather, it was sufficient that there \"was ample evidence from which the jury could conclude both that Bruckman participated in the scheme to defraud, and that <i>some use of the mails</i> was to be anticipated in the course of such scheme.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).

That case involved an insurance fraud in which the defendant faked an injury from a staged automobile accident. <i>Id.</i> at 271. The defendant received a claims draft, which is similar to a check, in person from the insurance agent, but a copy of the draft was sent to the insurance company. <i>Id.</i> The court found that there was insufficient evidence that the use of the mails was reasonably foreseeable because it was not common knowledge that insurance companies mail accounting copies of drafts. <i>See id.</i> at 273. In so holding, the court agreed \"that it is foreseeable that communications involving the policy, the details of the claim, or requests for the payment of the claim would be mailed.\" <i>Id.</i> But the court found this to be irrelevant because \"the substantive counts of [the defendant's] indictment did not allege such mailings.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that <i>Smith</i> is inconsistent with our analysis, we reject its approach.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The government assumed arguendo for purposes of this appeal that Rule 6(e) was violated.
