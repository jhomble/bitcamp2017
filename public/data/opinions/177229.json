Petitioner Le Bin Zhu, a native and\n\ncitizen of China, seeks review of a Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA) decision denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings\n\nbased on a claim of changed country circumstances.        We deny his\n\npetition.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            Zhu entered the United States at the Miami International\n\nAirport on June 21, 2001.         As he did not possess proper entry\n\ndocuments, he was interviewed by an officer of Immigration and\n\nNationality Service and detained. In a credible fear interview, he\n\nstated that he came to the United States because his family had\n\nbeaten him and expelled him from their house after he converted\n\nfrom Buddhism to Christianity.       An asylum officer found his fear\n\ncredible and referred his application to an Immigration Judge (IJ).\n\n            On June 25, 2001, Zhu was served with a Notice to Appear,\n\ncharging him with removability and ordering him to appear before an\n\nIJ at a date to be determined.     He was then paroled into the United\n\nStates, after which he moved to Boston.      Zhu claims that within a\n\nmonth he hired an attorney to handle his case.     He claims that this\n\nattorney told him that in order to file for political asylum, he\n\nfirst needed to file a motion to transfer venue from Miami to\n\nBoston, and that this could not be done until the hearing in Miami\n\nhad been scheduled.     Approximately two years later, on July 8,\n\n2003, Zhu was issued notice that his hearing had been scheduled at\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthe Miami Immigration Court.            On July 21, Zhu's counsel filed a\n\nmotion to transfer venue to Boston, which was granted.\n\n            On September 16, 2003, Zhu's counsel appeared before an\n\nIJ in Boston, stating that Zhu intended to file an application for\n\nasylum    and    requesting    a     continuance.         The    IJ   granted    the\n\ncontinuance until March 23, 2004, and requested that Zhu's counsel\n\nsubmit a brief on whether any asylum application would be time\n\nbarred.     Zhu     claims    that    ten    days     before    his   hearing,   his\n\ncounsel--who had failed to submit an asylum application or the\n\nrequested brief--informed Zhu that he would be unable to continue\n\nrepresenting him.       At the hearing, Zhu appeared with new counsel.\n\nHe conceded removability and filed an application for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (CAT).      This was almost three years after Zhu entered the\n\ncountry.\n\n            The IJ held a hearing on the merits on July 17, 2006.                 We\n\nbriefly summarize Zhu's testimony, which discussed two asserted\n\ngrounds for asylum: his new practice of Falun Gong, and his\n\nChristianity.\n\n            Zhu testified that he began practicing Falun Gong shortly\n\nafter arriving in the United States, in October 2001, and that he\n\npracticed       every   two   or     three    days.       He    stated   that    his\n\npredominantly Buddhist village would not allow him to return\n\nbecause of his practice, and that he feared returning to China\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fbecause he had read a newspaper reporting that China persecutes\n\nthose who practice Falun Gong.\n\n            Zhu     testified     that    he     converted    from     Buddhism   to\n\nChristianity when he was about 18 years old and that he started\n\nattending a Protestant Church in China in 1995.                 He stated that he\n\ncould not return to China, as neither his village nor his family\n\nwould   accept      him   given   that    he     associated     and    prayed   with\n\nChristians.       Zhu explained that although he had not practiced\n\nChristianity since arriving in the United States, he would resume\n\nhis practice if he returned to China where he had Christian\n\nfriends.      However, when Zhu was asked what it means to be a\n\nChristian, he did not provide an answer.\n\n            At    the     hearing,   Zhu        was   also    asked    to   explain\n\ninconsistencies in his statements.               He was asked why he had told\n\nthe asylum officer during his credible fear interview that he\n\nconverted to Christianity in 2000, not 1995.                 Zhu answered that it\n\nwas   not   until    approximately       2000    that   he   learned    more    about\n\nChristianity and its terminology.               Zhu was asked why he had told\n\nthe immigration official who interviewed him on his arrival at the\n\nMiami airport that he came to the United States to look for a job.\n\nHe testified, improbably, that this is what the snakehead who\n\nhelped him leave China told him to say.                  Zhu was asked whether\n\nsomeone also advised him on what answers to give in his IJ hearing.\n\nHe said no.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f           In an oral decision, the IJ denied Zhu's petition for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. This\n\ndecision was based on two independent grounds.\n\n           First, the IJ found that Zhu's asylum application was\n\npretermitted on the grounds that Zhu neither filed within one year\n\nof   arrival   nor   established   an    exception   to   this   statutory\n\nrequirement.   The IJ found that Zhu's argument for an exception--\n\nthat the attorney he had hired to file an application in 2001 had\n\nmisdirected him about the proper process--was vague and unsupported\n\nby the record.\n\n           Second, the IJ found that even if the application was not\n\ntime barred, it failed on the merits.          The IJ found that being\n\ndisowned by one's family does not meet the statutory criteria for\n\npast persecution.    The IJ also found that Zhu did not demonstrate\n\na credible, well-founded fear of future persecution.         The IJ found\n\nthat Zhu's statements about his Christian faith were inconsistent\n\nand lacked supporting documentation, and that his statements about\n\nhis practice of Falun Gong were devoid of any specificity and\n\nunsupported by materials demonstrating that he would be sanctioned\n\nfor his type of practice.     In addition, the IJ found that Zhu's\n\nlong delay in filing for asylum indicated that he did not actually\n\nfear future persecution.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f             The IJ also found that Zhu did not provide sufficient\n\nevidence to support a claim for withholding of removal or relief\n\nunder the CAT.\n\n             The BIA affirmed, finding that Zhu failed to provide an\n\nadequate explanation for why he had not timely filed for asylum,\n\nthat   his   testimony   was   not   credible,    and    that,   credibility\n\nnotwithstanding, he failed to establish past persecution or a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.          The BIA also found that\n\nZhu failed to meet the burden for withholding of removal and relief\n\nunder the CAT.     Zhu did not seek review of the BIA's decision and\n\nit became final.     That decision is not before us.\n\n             After more than a year had passed, however, Zhu filed a\n\nmotion to reopen with the BIA.             While a motion to reopen must\n\nnormally be filed within ninety days, Zhu argued that his case\n\nqualified for two exceptions to this rule--equitable tolling based\n\non ineffective assistance of counsel, and a statutory exception\n\nbased on changed country conditions.\n\n             On equitable tolling, Zhu argued that ineffective counsel\n\nwas responsible for the untimeliness of his underlying application\n\nfor asylum.    He did not specify how this explained or justified the\n\nuntimeliness of his motion to reopen.\n\n             On changed country conditions, Zhu argued that events\n\nthat had transpired since his original application increased his\n\nindividualized risk of persecution in China.            He alleged that his\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fvillage government had learned of his application for asylum and\n\nhis involvement with Falun Gong in the United States, and that it\n\nhad served his mother with a notice asking her to inform Zhu that\n\nhe    had   committed      treason   and    needed      to    return    to    China     and\n\nsurrender himself for severe punishment. In support of this claim,\n\nZhu   provided     an    unauthenticated         copy   of    the    notice     and    what\n\npurported to be an affidavit from his mother; he argued that the\n\nrequirement,       under    8     C.F.R.   §     1287.6,      that     the    notice    be\n\nauthenticated should be waived. In addition, Zhu provided evidence\n\nof his recent marriage to a Chinese citizen in the United States\n\nand the birth of their daughter, stating that they wished to have\n\nmore children.      Although Zhu did not say so expressly, the BIA took\n\nthis to be a claim that he would therefore run afoul of China's\n\nfamily planning policies.\n\n             On December 12, 2009, the BIA denied Zhu's motion to\n\nreopen.     The BIA rejected Zhu's claim for equitable tolling based\n\non ineffective counsel, finding a lack of due diligence: \"Although\n\n[Zhu] was aware of the alleged ineffective assistance since July\n\n2006, at the latest, [he] did not file a complaint or this motion\n\nuntil June 2009.\"\n\n             The   BIA     also    rejected      Zhu's       argument    that    changed\n\nconditions in China materially affected his case.                            As to Zhu's\n\nclaim regarding his new family, the BIA found that Zhu did not\n\nprovide evidence of changes in China's family planning policies.\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fAs to Zhu's claim regarding his practice of Falun Gong, the BIA\n\nfound that in light of the IJ's adverse credibility finding, the\n\nunauthenticated         village   committee   document      and     \"the    letter\n\nallegedly sent by [his] mother\" failed to satisfy the \"heavy\n\nburden\" of establishing material changed circumstances.\n\n             On January 6, 2010, Zhu filed a timely petition for\n\nreview of the BIA's refusal to reopen his case on the basis of\n\nchanged country conditions.           He argues generally that the BIA's\n\ndecision was \"against the weight of the evidence\" and \"in error as\n\na matter of law.\"          He also argues, more specifically, that the\n\nBIA's decision was based on the fact that the village committee\n\nnotice     was    not   authenticated--and    that   this   was     an    abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.       Zhu does not petition for review of the BIA's denial\n\nof   his   claim    for   equitable   tolling   or   his    claim    of    changed\n\nconditions based on his new family, thereby waiving these claims.\n\n                                       II.\n\n             Motions to reopen deportation proceedings are disfavored\n\ndue to the \"strong public interest in bringing litigation to a\n\nclose . . . promptly.\"        Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (alteration in original) (quoting INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S.\n\n94, 107 (1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Consequently,\n\nthe BIA enjoys a broad measure of latitude in passing upon such\n\nmotions.\"        Lemus v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 399, 401 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nWe review the BIA's decision for abuse of discretion, upholding the\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fdecision \"unless the complaining party can show that the BIA\n\ncommitted   an   error   of   law   or   exercised   its   judgment   in   an\n\narbitrary, capricious, or irrational way.\"           Raza v. Gonzales, 484\n\nF.3d 125, 127 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            The requirement that motions to reopen must be filed\n\nwithin ninety days of the final administrative decision, 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.2(c)(2), may be relaxed if a petitioner \"makes a convincing\n\ndemonstration of changed conditions in his homeland,\" Raza, 484\n\nF.3d at 127.     The motion must state new facts that will be proven\n\nat a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.                 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.2(c)(1).     This new evidence must be material, and it must\n\nhave been unavailable and undiscoverable at the former hearing.             8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).          In addition, the evidence submitted\n\n\"must, at a bare minimum, establish a prima facie case sufficient\n\nto ground a claim of eligibility for the underlying substantive\n\nrelief.\"    Raza, 484 F.3d at 128.\n\n            Here, the BIA did not act in an arbitrary and capricious\n\nmanner in denying Zhu's motion to reopen.            Rather, it carefully\n\nconsidered all of the evidence on which Zhu rested his case and\n\nprovided a clear explanation of its reasoning in finding the\n\nevidence insufficient to support his motion to reopen.\n\n            The BIA was not, as Zhu suggests, compelled to afford\n\nfull evidentiary weight to the unauthenticated village committee\n\nnotice that he submitted.      It is well within the BIA's discretion\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fto find that lack of authentication undermines the evidentiary\n\nvalue of a document.         See Tawadrous v. Holder, 565 F.3d 35, 39 n.2\n\n(1st Cir. 2009) (agreeing with the BIA that a document was owed\n\n\"little or no weight due to its nature as an unauthenticated\n\nphotocopy\").      This is especially the case when, as here, the BIA's\n\ndecision to do so is supported by an adverse credibility finding.\n\nSee Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 143, 146-147 (2d Cir. 2007)\n\n(finding no abuse of discretion in the BIA's refusal to credit an\n\nunauthenticated notice offered by an applicant in support of his\n\nmotion to reopen where he had been found not credible in the\n\nunderlying proceedings).\n\n              The BIA was also within its discretion in finding that\n\n\"the letter allegedly sent by [Zhu's] mother\" did not satisfy the\n\n\"heavy burden\" of establishing material changed circumstances. Cf.\n\nZheng   v.    Mukasey,      546   F.3d   70,    72   (1st     Cir.   2008)    (\"Absent\n\nsubstantiation, self serving affidavits from petitioner and her\n\nimmediate family are of limited evidentiary value.\").\n\n              Moreover, even if the BIA were required to give full\n\nevidentiary weight to the letter from Zhu's mother and the village\n\ncommittee     notice,    this     evidence      would   not    compel   the    BIA   to\n\nconclude that Zhu had made out a prima facie case for asylum.\n\nBecause Zhu never established a credible claim for asylum based on\n\nhis practice of Falun Gong, the BIA could reasonably find that the\n\nalleged      changes   in    country     conditions     were    immaterial.          Cf.\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fTawadrous, 565 F.3d at 39 (\"[E]ven if we were to . . . find that\n\nthe letter from [petitioner's] father was previously unavailable,\n\nwe conclude that this evidence merely reiterates [his] hearing\n\ntestimony    without    rehabilitating     his    failed    credibility   or\n\ndocumenting materially changed country conditions.\"); Lemus, 489\n\nF.3d at 401 (\"To cinch matters, the newly proffered information\n\ndoes nothing to rehabilitate the petitioner's failed credibility --\n\nand . . . the final administrative decision in this case hinged\n\nmainly on an adverse credibility determination.\").\n\n            Zhu's argument that the BIA made an error of law in\n\ndenying his motion is likewise without merit.               He argues that\n\n\"[b]ecause the Board essentially failed to account whether the new\n\nfacts asserted by Zhu are ever materially relevant to his claim for\n\nasylum . . . the finding on Zhu's failure to show changed country\n\nconditions is erroneous as a matter of law.\"               However, the BIA\n\nexpressly discussed the materiality of the evidence, explaining\n\nthat \"the newly submitted evidence is inadequate to show changed\n\ncircumstances   or     conditions   in   China   which   materially   affect\n\n[Zhu's] eligibility\" for the relief he requested.\n\n            The petition is denied.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f",

As he did not possess proper entry documents, he was interviewed by an officer of Immigration and Nationality Service and detained. In a credible fear interview, he stated that he came to the United States because his family had beaten him and expelled him from their house after he converted from Buddhism to Christianity.

Zhu claims that ten days before his hearing, his counselwho had failed to submit an asylum application or the requested brief informed Zhu that he would be unable to continue representing him.

The IJ found that Zhu's statements about his Christian faith were inconsistent and lacked supporting documentation, and that his statements about his practice of Falun Gong were devoid of any specificity and unsupported by materials demonstrating that he would be sanctioned for his type of practice.

The BIA also found that Zhu failed to meet the burden for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. Zhu did not seek review of the BIA's decision and it became final. That decision is not before us.</p>\n<p>After more than a year had passed, however, Zhu filed a motion to reopen with the BIA. While a motion to reopen must normally be filed within ninety days, Zhu argued that his case qualified for two exceptions to this ruleequitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel, and a statutory exception based on changed country conditions.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> On equitable tolling, Zhu argued that ineffective counsel was responsible for the untimeliness of his underlying application for asylum. He did not specify how this explained or justified the untimeliness of his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p>On changed country conditions, Zhu argued that events that had transpired since his original application increased his individualized risk of persecution in China. He alleged that his village government had learned of his application for asylum and his involvement with Falun Gong in the United States, and that it had served his mother with a notice asking her to inform Zhu that he had committed treason and needed to return to China and surrender himself for severe punishment. In support of this claim, Zhu provided an unauthenticated copy of the notice and what purported to be an affidavit from his mother; he argued that the requirement, under 8 C.F.R. § 1287.6, that the notice be authenticated should be waived. In addition, Zhu provided evidence of his recent marriage to a Chinese citizen in the United States and the birth of their daughter, stating that they wished to have more children. Although Zhu did not say so expressly, the BIA took this to be a claim that he would therefore run afoul of China's family planning policies.</p>\n<p>On December 12, 2009, the BIA denied Zhu's motion to reopen. The BIA rejected Zhu's claim for equitable tolling based on ineffective counsel, finding a lack of due diligence: \"Although [Zhu] was aware of the alleged ineffective assistance since July 2006, at the latest, [he] did not file a complaint or this motion until June 2009.\"</p>\n<p>The BIA also rejected Zhu's argument that changed conditions in China materially affected his case. As to Zhu's claim regarding his new family, the BIA found that Zhu did not provide evidence of changes in China's family planning policies. As to Zhu's claim regarding his practice of Falun Gong, the BIA found that in light of the IJ's adverse credibility finding, the unauthenticated village committee document and \"the letter allegedly sent by [his] mother\" failed to satisfy the \"heavy burden\" of establishing material changed circumstances.</p>\n<p>On January 6, 2010, Zhu filed a timely petition for review of the BIA's refusal to reopen his case on the basis of changed country conditions. He argues generally that the BIA's decision was \"against the weight of the evidence\" and \"in error as a matter of law.\" He also argues, more specifically, that the BIA's decision was based on the fact that the village committee notice was not authenticatedand that this was an abuse of discretion. Zhu does not petition for review of the BIA's denial of his claim for equitable tolling or his claim of changed conditions based on his new family, thereby waiving these claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Motions to reopen deportation proceedings are disfavored due to the \"strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close . . . promptly.\" <i>Fesseha v.

We deny his petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Zhu entered the United States at the Miami International Airport on June 21, 2001. As he did not possess proper entry documents, he was interviewed by an officer of Immigration and Nationality Service and detained. In a credible fear interview, he stated that he came to the United States because his family had beaten him and expelled him from their house after he converted from Buddhism to Christianity. An asylum officer found his fear credible and referred his application to an Immigration Judge (IJ).</p>\n<p>On June 25, 2001, Zhu was served with a Notice to Appear, charging him with removability and ordering him to appear before an IJ at a date to be determined. He was then paroled into the United States, after which he moved to Boston. Zhu claims that within a month he hired an attorney to handle his case. He claims that this attorney told him that in order to file for political asylum, he first needed to file a motion to transfer venue from Miami to Boston, and that this could not be done until the hearing in Miami had been scheduled. Approximately two years later, on July 8, 2003, Zhu was issued notice that his hearing had been scheduled at the Miami Immigration Court. On July 21, Zhu's counsel filed a motion to transfer venue to Boston, which was granted.</p>\n<p>On September 16, 2003, Zhu's counsel appeared before an IJ in Boston, stating that Zhu intended to file an application for asylum and requesting a continuance. The IJ granted the continuance until March 23, 2004, and requested that Zhu's counsel submit a brief on whether any asylum application would be time barred. Zhu claims that ten days before his hearing, his counselwho had failed to submit an asylum application or the requested brief informed Zhu that he would be unable to continue representing him. At the hearing, Zhu appeared with new counsel. He conceded removability and filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). This was almost three years after Zhu entered the country.</p>\n<p>The IJ held a hearing on the merits on July 17, 2006. We briefly summarize Zhu's testimony, which discussed two asserted grounds for asylum: his new practice of Falun Gong, and his Christianity.</p>\n<p>Zhu testified that he began practicing Falun Gong shortly after arriving in the United States, in October 2001, and that he practiced every two or three days. He stated that his predominantly Buddhist village would not allow him to return because of his practice, and that he feared returning to China because he had read a newspaper reporting that China persecutes those who practice Falun Gong.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> Zhu testified that he converted from Buddhism to Christianity when he was about 18 years old and that he started attending a Protestant Church in China in 1995. He stated that he could not return to China, as neither his village nor his family would accept him given that he associated and prayed with Christians. Zhu explained that although he had not practiced Christianity since arriving in the United States, he would resume his practice if he returned to China where he had Christian friends. However, when Zhu was asked what it means to be a Christian, he did not provide an answer.</p>\n<p>At the hearing, Zhu was also asked to explain inconsistencies in his statements. He was asked why he had told the asylum officer during his credible fear interview that he converted to Christianity in 2000, not 1995. Zhu answered that it was not until approximately 2000 that he learned more about Christianity and its terminology. Zhu was asked why he had told the immigration official who interviewed him on his arrival at the Miami airport that he came to the United States to look for a job. He testified, improbably, that this is what the snakehead who helped him leave China told him to say. Zhu was asked whether someone also advised him on what answers to give in his IJ hearing. He said no.</p>\n<p>In an oral decision, the IJ denied Zhu's petition for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. This decision was based on two independent grounds.</p>\n<p>First, the IJ found that Zhu's asylum application was pretermitted on the grounds that Zhu neither filed within one year of arrival nor established an exception to this statutory requirement. The IJ found that Zhu's argument for an exceptionthat the attorney he had hired to file an application in 2001 had misdirected him about the proper processwas vague and unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p>Second, the IJ found that even if the application was not time barred, it failed on the merits. The IJ found that being disowned by one's family does not meet the statutory criteria for past persecution. The IJ also found that Zhu did not demonstrate a credible, well-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ found that Zhu's statements about his Christian faith were inconsistent and lacked supporting documentation, and that his statements about his practice of Falun Gong were devoid of any specificity and unsupported by materials demonstrating that he would be sanctioned for his type of practice. In addition, the IJ found that Zhu's long delay in filing for asylum indicated that he did not actually fear future persecution.</p>\n<p>The IJ also found that Zhu did not provide sufficient evidence to support a claim for withholding of removal or relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p>The BIA affirmed, finding that Zhu failed to provide an adequate explanation for why he had not timely filed for asylum, that his testimony was not credible, and that, credibility notwithstanding, he failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The BIA also found that Zhu failed to meet the burden for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. Zhu did not seek review of the BIA's decision and it became final.
