William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Lynch, Chief Judge,\n               Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Theodore H. Goguen, Jr. on brief for appellant.\n     Leonard Kesten, Thomas Donohue, Deidre Brennan Regan, and\nBrody, Hardoon, Perkins & Kesten, LLP on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          June 9, 2010\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.      A jury rejected all of Frederick\n\nGrossmith's civil rights claims against two Foxborough Police\n\nofficers arising out of his April 2006 arrest for shooting his\n\nneighbor's pet dog, a Siberian husky named Kato.           Grossmith's 2007\n\nfederal suit against the police officers asserted, under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, §§ 11H, 11I, claims of unlawful\n\nseizure and deprivation of liberty in violation of Grossmith's\n\nFourth     and   Fourteenth   Amendment     rights   and    the    corollary\n\nMassachusetts constitutional rights, as well as claims of assault,\n\nbattery,    false   arrest,   malicious   prosecution,     and    intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.            Grossmith now appeals two\n\nevidentiary rulings by the district court, seeking a new trial.\n\n            Grossmith's version at trial was that Kato had earlier\n\nharassed livestock on Grossmith's property and was on his property\n\nagain on the day of the shooting.         When Grossmith approached Kato\n\nto see the dog's tags, Kato bit him and got into a fight with\n\nGrossmith's own dog.      In response, Grossmith walked over to his\n\ncar, got his rifle, and loaded it.        When Kato began walking toward\n\nGrossmith in a threatening way, Grossmith took aim and shot Kato in\n\nthe head.\n\n            According to evidence the defense presented at trial,\n\nhowever, Grossmith had given a rather different account to the\n\npolice that day.       According to the transcript of the 911 call\n\nGrossmith made immediately after the incident, Grossmith only told\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fthe operator that he shot Kato after the dog bit him; Grossmith\n\nmade no mention of the fight between his own dog and Kato and also\n\ndid not say that he had shot Kato only after the dog began walking\n\ntoward Grossmith.\n\n            Further, police officers testified that when they arrived\n\non the scene following the incident, Grossmith said he was bitten\n\nafter he attempted to check the dog's tags, and that he eventually\n\nshook the dog free.        When asked by the officers, Grossmith said\n\nKato had not further threatened him, nor tried to attack Grossmith\n\nafter Grossmith was bitten.       Grossmith made no mention at the time\n\nof   a   fight   between   Kato   and    Grossmith's   own   dog.   Rather,\n\nGrossmith's account was that Kato was just standing and watching\n\nwhen Grossmith went for his gun.         The officers did not believe they\n\nhad any evidence the dog put either livestock or Grossmith and his\n\ndog at immediate threat of danger when Grossmith shot Kato.             The\n\nofficers also denied Grossmith's claim that he had been mishandled\n\nduring his arrest.     Grossmith did not complain about any pain and\n\ndeclined any further treatment other than for the dog bite.\n\n            The state charges against Grossmith, for which he was\n\narrested, were cruelty to animals, unlawful killing of an animal,\n\nand discharge of a firearm near a highway.         He was later acquitted\n\nof those charges.      This lawsuit against the police officers who\n\narrested Grossmith followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f              Grossmith presents two arguments on appeal, asserting\n\nthat the court erred in allowing the defendants to introduce two\n\npieces of evidence--a photograph of Kato and testimony regarding\n\nKato's character--and that the errors caused so much prejudice to\n\nhim that he is entitled to a new trial.                  There was no error in\n\neither ruling, and we affirm.\n\n              Grossmith's attack on evidentiary rulings is an uphill\n\nbattle because the appellate standard of review, assuming an\n\nappropriate objection was made at trial, is to ask whether there\n\nwas an abuse of discretion by the trial judge.                  United States v.\n\nMorales-Machuca,     546   F.3d   13,    22   (1st   Cir.      2008).        Relevant\n\nevidence may be excluded by the district judge if \"its probative\n\nvalue    is   substantially    outweighed      by    the    danger      of    unfair\n\nprejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\"                    Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 403.      Trial judges are given deference in ruling on the\n\nadmission of evidence. See United States v. Salimonu, 182 F.3d 63,\n\n72 (1st Cir. 1999).        It is rare for a party on appeal to upset a\n\njury verdict on this basis.\n\n              Grossmith first complains that a photograph of Kato,\n\ntaken within the last year before the shooting, should not have\n\nbeen    admitted   into    evidence     because     it   was    irrelevant,       its\n\nprobative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial\n\neffect, and it distracted the jury from the main issues.                     While it\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fis doubtful this objection to the photograph was preserved at\n\ntrial, we will assume in Grossmith's favor that it was.\n\n            Grossmith's evidence and his testimony at the federal\n\ntrial made the photograph relevant.        Grossmith asserted that the\n\ndefendants did not have probable cause to arrest him because he had\n\nshot Kato to protect himself, his dog, and his livestock.                He\n\ntestified   to   the    events   surrounding   the   shooting   itself   and\n\ncharacterized the dog as \"vicious,\" \"bloodthirsty,\" and looking\n\nlike a wolf or a coyote.           Grossmith also admitted on cross-\n\nexamination that he had previously said Kato was \"malnourished,\n\nflea-bitten, unkempt and that his owner should be prosecuted for\n\nanimal cruelty.\"       Grossmith further introduced other witnesses who\n\ntestified to Kato's appearance, including a neighbor who compared\n\nKato's appearance to that of a wolf or coyote and described an\n\nincident in which he drove Kato off his property because the\n\nwitness was concerned for his children's safety.\n\n            The photograph, properly authenticated,1 was useful to\n\nthe jury in evaluating the credibility of Grossmith's testimony and\n\nthat of others.    The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nfinding that both parties had made Kato's appearance relevant to\n\nthe case and admitting the photograph.         The image was inconsistent\n\n\n     1\n          We reject Grossmith's argument that the district court's\nadmission of the photograph following authentication by a witness\nsomehow vouched for that witness's credibility over Grossmith's.\nGrossmith never challenged the authenticity of the photograph and\nso the argument is waived.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fwith much of Grossmith's description of the dog, but was consistent\n\nwith one of the defendant police officer's descriptions.                 The\n\nphotograph   thus   was    useful   to    the   jury   in   evaluating   the\n\ncredibility of Grossmith and other witnesses.\n\n           The   court    could   readily   conclude   there   was   nothing\n\nunfairly prejudicial, Fed. R. Evid. 403, about this evidence.\n\nMoreover, the district judge properly and repeatedly instructed the\n\njury that sympathy could not be a basis for the verdict and,\n\nfurther, that the question before them was not whether Grossmith\n\nhad committed a crime by shooting Kato, but rather whether a\n\nreasonable officer would have had probable cause to believe that\n\nGrossmith had committed a crime.\n\n           Grossmith also complains that the district court erred in\n\nadmitting testimony about the dog's characteristic behavior and its\n\nphysical appearance.      The testimony came from a family member who\n\nhad frequent contact with the dog because it lived with the\n\nwitness's mother.    Since the mother ran a daycare center at the\n\nhome, the dog was in constant contact with children playing with\n\nhim and was described as \"a great dog\" and a \"nice dog.\"                 The\n\nfamily member also testified that Kato was well-fed and well-\n\ngroomed.\n\n           Assuming Grossmith's appeal on this issue is not waived,\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting this\n\nevidence for the same reasons described above.              Grossmith's own\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\ftestimony, as well as the testimony of other witnesses that he\n\ncalled, made Kato's character and appearance relevant to this case.\n\n          The judgment is affirmed.     Costs are awarded to the\n\ndefendants.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",
