Appellant Juan  C. Guzm n-\n                                   \n\nRivera  and  two  co-defendants  were  charged  with  aiding  and\n\nabetting  each other  in  the assault  and  battery of  a  postal\n\ncontractor  and robbing  him  of mail,1  unlawful possession  and\n\nretention  of  United  States  treasury  checks,2  and use  of  a\n\nfirearm in  the commission of  these crimes.3   The co-defendants\n\nnever went to trial.  One was declared incompetent, and the other\n\naccepted   a  plea  bargain.    Appellant  now  argues  that  the\n\ngovernment offered  unreliable evidence of  appellant's identity,\n\nand that  the evidence against him was  therefore insufficient to\n\nsupport his convictions.  Because we find that the district court\n\nproperly admitted the disputed evidence, and that a rational jury\n\ncould find appellant  guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, we affirm\n\nthe verdict.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n                                      \n\n          Government   witness   Ramos-Cotto,  a   mail  carrier,\n\ntestified  to  the  following.    On  August  2,  1991,  two  men\n\napproached him while he was  distributing mail.  One of  the men,\n\nlater identified as appellant, pointed a .38 caliber revolver  at\n\nRamos-Cotto's neck, and threatened to kill him if he moved.  In a\n\nviolent exchange, appellant took the keys to the mail vehicle and\n\nthe  mail that was in Ramos-Cotto's hand.  Finally, appellant and\n\nthe other man pulled Ramos-Cotto across the street, and appellant\n\nsaid \"start running downhill  or I'll kill you.\"   While running,\n\n                    \n\n1  18 U.S.C.    2, 2114.\n\n2  18 U.S.C.    2, 510(b).\n\n3  18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1).\n\nRamos-Cotto heard the car leave.  \n\n          After  the  incident,  Ramos-Cotto  saw  and recognized\n\nappellant on  two separate  occasions while distributing  mail on\n\nthe same route.   Approximately two  weeks later, upon  receiving\n\nconfidential  information  that  appellant  might  be  in certain\n\nplaces, Ramos-Cotto  and four postal investigators  went to these\n\nlocations to look for  him.  After passing by  approximately five\n\nof  the  suggested  locations,  Ramos-Cotto  identified appellant\n\ntalking   to  three  other  people  in  a  grocery  store.    The\n\ninvestigators arrested appellant and one other individual.\n\n          The  government also introduced  evidence that when the\n\npolice  found  the mail  car, four  hundred  pieces of  mail were\n\nmissing, including  a  number  of social  security  checks.    In\n\naddition, after  the robbery,  the Dominican Republic's  national\n\npolice apprehended  one of  the co-defendants attempting  to cash\n\nsocial security checks bearing a San Juan address.\n\n          Appellant argues that we should  reverse his conviction\n\nfor  two  reasons:    (1)  the  government's  evidence  regarding\n\nappellant's identity was unreliable, and thus, the district court\n\nshould  not have  admitted  it; and  (2)  there was  insufficient\n\nevidence to sustain appellant's convictions.  \n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Appellant's first  argument is a due  process argument.\n\nA district court deprives a defendant of due process by admitting\n\nevidence of an identification  that has proven \"'so impermissibly\n\nsuggestive  as to give rise  to a very  substantial likelihood of\n\n                               -3-\n\nirreparable misidentification.'\"   United States v.  Bouthot, 878\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  1506,  1514 (1st  Cir.  1989)  (quoting Simmons  v.  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968)).  Under the first prong of this\n      \n\ntest,  appellant  must  show  impermissible  suggestion   by  law\n\nenforcement  officials.  See United  States v. Gray,  958 F.2d 9,\n                                                   \n\n13-14 (1st Cir. 1992); Bouthot, 878 F.2d at 1514.\n                              \n\n          Appellant asks us to  infer that the identification was\n\nunduly suggestive for four reasons:  (1) the search for appellant\n\noccurred  one month  after the  robbery and  after co-defendants'\n\narrests; (2) the investigators  arrested a second individual with\n\nappellant who was later  released; (3) the investigation revealed\n\nno fingerprints belonging to appellant; and (4) Ramos-Cotto never\n\ndescribed appellant at the  time of the robbery.   These are  all\n\ngood arguments  that  trial counsel  made to  the jury  regarding\n\nRamos-Cotto's  credibility.    Although   the  record  offers  no\n\nexplanation for  these circumstances, we cannot  draw the sizable\n\ninference that appellant seeks. \n\n          The   record  evidence   shows   that  upon   receiving\n\nconfidential information regarding  appellant's whereabouts,  the\n\npostal   investigators  brought  Ramos-Cotto  to  at  least  five\n\ndifferent  public locations to look for him.  (Transcript of Jury\n\nTrial  at 38-39).  After visiting the fifth location, they passed\n\na grocery  store where Ramos-Cotto saw  and identified appellant.\n\nId.  They then passed by  a second time so that Ramos-Cotto could\n  \n\nidentify  him again.   Id.  The record  exhibits no evidence that\n                         \n\nthe  investigators  controlled  or  manipulated  the  people that\n\n                               -4-\n\nRamos-Cotto  would encounter  during this search.   Nor  does the\n\nrecord reveal that the  investigators indicated to Ramos-Cotto in\n\nany way that they believed appellant was the perpetrator.  Ramos-\n\nCotto testified that he  was at all times since  the robbery able\n\nto identify appellant  as his assailant.  Id. at  39-40.  Indeed,\n                                            \n\nhe  testified  that  he  identified  appellant  on  two  previous\n\noccasions without the investigators,  and that he promptly called\n\none of the  investigators after the second sighting.   Id. at 37-\n                                                         \n\n40, 62.  Based on these facts, we can find no undue suggestion by\n\nlaw-enforcement officials.\n\n          Since  we do not  find the identification impermissibly\n\nsuggestive, we need not reach the likelihood of misidentification\n\nprong of the test.  See Gray, 958 F.2d at 14.  Even if we were to\n                            \n\nreach  that issue,  however, it  would not  significantly bolster\n\nappellant's  argument.  Under the second prong, we consider:  (1)\n\nthe witness' opportunity to view the  defendant during the crime;\n\n(2) the  witness' degree of  attention at the time  of the crime;\n\n(3)  the accuracy  of  the witness'  prior  description; (4)  the\n\nwitness' level  of certainty when identifying the  suspect at the\n\nconfrontation; and (5) the  length of time between the  crime and\n\nthe confrontation.  United States v. Alexander, 868 F.2d 492, 495\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 979 (1989).  \n                        \n\n          In the present case, three of the  five factors support\n\nthe  reliability  of the  identification.   Ramos-Cotto testified\n\nthat  he  stood right  next  to  appellant, almost  face-to-face,\n\nduring the robbery and thus had a significant opportunity to view\n\n                               -5-\n\nhim.   (Transcript  of Jury  Trial at  39-40).   Additionally, he\n\ntestified that  he specifically  focused on appellant  during the\n\nincident while appellant pointed a  gun at him, and that he  knew\n\nat  all relevant times that he could identify appellant, which he\n\ndid twice before the final confrontation.  While Ramos-Cotto gave\n\nno  prior description of appellant  and waited a  month until the\n\nfinal confrontation,  the totality of the  circumstances does not\n\nmandate a finding of unreliability.  As such, we are unwilling to\n\nusurp  the determination  from the  jury.   See United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nTurner, 892 F.2d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 1989) (identification  evidence\n      \n\nshould be withheld from jury only in extraordinary cases).\n\n          Appellant's second argument challenges  the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence against him.  To  overturn  a  jury's  conviction\n\nbased  on insufficient evidence,  we must  find that  no rational\n\njury  could conclude  beyond  a reasonable  doubt that  appellant\n\ncommitted the crimes charged.   United States v. Maraj,  947 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n520,  522-23 (1st Cir.  1991).  In  doing so, we  must review the\n\nrecord  in the light most favorable to the government and resolve\n\nall credibility issues in favor of the verdict.  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nAngiulo, 897 F.2d 1169,  1197 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  498 U.S.\n                                                      \n\n845 (1990).\n\n          Reading  the  record  in   this  light,  we  find  that\n\nsufficient  evidence existed to  convict appellant.   The bulk of\n\nappellant's sufficiency argument concerns the  reliability of the\n\ntestimony  identifying appellant  as the  perpetrator.   As noted\n\nabove,  Ramos-Cotto testified that he  had plenty of  time to see\n\n                               -6-\n\nappellant at the time of the crime and twice thereafter.  He also\n\ntestified that  he concentrated  on appellant during  the robbery\n\nbecause appellant had the gun.  (Transcript of Jury Trial at 54).\n\nRamos-Cotto looked for appellant  in five public locations before\n\nfinding  him  at  the  grocery   store.    Appellant  had   ample\n\nopportunity  to  cross-examine   Ramos  Cotto  with   respect  to\n\nappellant's identity.  In  fact, the trial transcript  reveals at\n\nleast  twenty pages of cross-examination  on this very  issue.  A\n\njury   could  rationally   choose   to   rely  on   Ramos-Cotto's\n\nidentification.  We find no error in the ultimate verdict on this\n\nground.\n\n          Appellant's other  sufficiency argument fails  as well.\n\nAppellant  argues that  the government  failed to  show  that the\n\nsocial security checks confiscated from  appellant's co-defendant\n\nwere  the checks  that  appellant allegedly  stole.   Appellant's\n\nargument  fails  because  Ramos-Cotto  testified  that  the  four\n\ndisputed checks were among  those taken during the robbery.   Id.\n                                                                \n\nat 41-42.  He  further testified that he recognized  them because\n\nthey displayed his mail distribution route number and the date of\n\nthe robbery, and  he recognized  the names of  the addressees  as\n\nindividuals who  receive mail  on his  route.  Id.  at 41.   This\n                                                 \n\nevidence  was  sufficient to  show  that  the confiscated  social\n\nsecurity checks were taken during the robbery at issue.\n\n          Finally, after reviewing the remaining  elements of the\n\ncharges,   we  find   that  the   evidence  presented   at  trial\n\nsufficiently supported  appellant's convictions.   We affirm  the\n\n                               -7-\n\nverdict.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -8-\n",

In\n\naddition, after  the robbery,  the Dominican Republic's  national\n\npolice apprehended  one of  the co-defendants attempting  to cash\n\nsocial security checks bearing a San Juan address.\n\n          Appellant argues that we should  reverse his conviction\n\nfor  two  reasons:    (1)  the  government's  evidence  regarding\n\nappellant's identity was unreliable, and thus, the district court\n\nshould  not have  admitted  it; and  (2)  there was  insufficient\n\nevidence to sustain appellant's convictions.  \n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Appellant's first  argument is a due  process argument.\n\nA district court deprives a defendant of due process by admitting\n\nevidence of an identification  that has proven \"'so impermissibly\n\nsuggestive  as to give rise  to a very  substantial likelihood of\n\n                               -3-\n\nirreparable misidentification.'\"   United States v.

These are  all\n\ngood arguments  that  trial counsel  made to  the jury  regarding\n\nRamos-Cotto's  credibility.    Although   the  record  offers  no\n\nexplanation for  these circumstances, we cannot  draw the sizable\n\ninference that appellant seeks. \n\n          The   record  evidence   shows   that  upon   receiving\n\nconfidential information regarding  appellant's whereabouts,  the\n\npostal   investigators  brought  Ramos-Cotto  to  at  least  five\n\ndifferent  public locations to look for him.  (Transcript of Jury\n\nTrial  at 38-39).  After visiting the fifth location, they passed\n\na grocery  store where Ramos-Cotto saw  and identified appellant.\n\nId.  They then passed by  a second time so that Ramos-Cotto could\n  \n\nidentify  him again.   Id.  The record  exhibits no evidence that\n                         \n\nthe  investigators  controlled  or  manipulated  the  people that\n\n                               -4-\n\nRamos-Cotto  would encounter  during this search.   Nor  does the\n\nrecord reveal that the  investigators indicated to Ramos-Cotto in\n\nany way that they believed appellant was the perpetrator.  Ramos-\n\nCotto testified that he  was at all times since  the robbery able\n\nto identify appellant  as his assailant.  Id. at  39-40.  Indeed,\n                                            \n\nhe  testified  that  he  identified  appellant  on  two  previous\n\noccasions without the investigators,  and that he promptly called\n\none of the  investigators after the second sighting.   Id. at 37-\n                                                         \n\n40, 62.  Based on these facts, we can find no undue suggestion by\n\nlaw-enforcement officials.\n\n          Since  we do not  find the identification impermissibly\n\nsuggestive, we need not reach the likelihood of misidentification\n\nprong of the test.  See Gray, 958 F.2d at 14.  Even if we were to\n                            \n\nreach  that issue,  however, it  would not  significantly bolster\n\nappellant's  argument.  Under the second prong, we consider:  (1)\n\nthe witness' opportunity to view the  defendant during the crime;\n\n(2) the  witness' degree of  attention at the time  of the crime;\n\n(3)  the accuracy  of  the witness'  prior  description; (4)  the\n\nwitness' level  of certainty when identifying the  suspect at the\n\nconfrontation; and (5) the  length of time between the  crime and\n\nthe confrontation.

Alexander, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518838\"><a href=\"/opinion/518838/united-states-v-david-alexander-united-states-of-america-v-everton/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 495\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989).  \n                        \n\n          In the present case, three of the  five factors support\n\nthe  reliability  of the  identification.   Ramos-Cotto testified\n\nthat  he  stood right  next  to  appellant, almost  face-to-face,\n\nduring the robbery and thus had a significant opportunity to view\n\n                               -5-\n\nhim.   (Transcript  of Jury  Trial at  39-40).   Additionally, he\n\ntestified that  he specifically  focused on appellant  during the\n\nincident while appellant pointed a  gun at him, and that he  knew\n\nat  all relevant times that he could identify appellant, which he\n\ndid twice before the final confrontation.  While Ramos-Cotto gave\n\nno  prior description of appellant  and waited a  month until the\n\nfinal confrontation,  the totality of the  circumstances does not\n\nmandate a finding of unreliability.  As such, we are unwilling to\n\nusurp  the determination  from the  jury.   See United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nTurner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533862\"><a href=\"/opinion/533862/united-states-v-james-e-turner/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14 (1st Cir. 1989) (identification  evidence\n      \n\nshould be withheld from jury only in extraordinary cases).\n\n          Appellant's second argument challenges  the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence against him.  To  overturn  a  jury's  conviction\n\nbased  on insufficient evidence,  we must  find that  no rational\n\njury  could conclude  beyond  a reasonable  doubt that  appellant\n\ncommitted the crimes charged.

In  doing so, we  must review the\n\nrecord  in the light most favorable to the government and resolve\n\nall credibility issues in favor of the verdict.  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nAngiulo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537726\"><a href=\"/opinion/537726/united-states-v-gennaro-j-angiulo-donato-f-angiulo-samuel-s-granito/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1197 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n                                                      \n\n<span class=\"page\">845</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990).\n\n          Reading  the  record  in   this  light,  we  find  that\n\nsufficient  evidence existed to  convict appellant.   The bulk of\n\nappellant's sufficiency argument concerns the  reliability of the\n\ntestimony  identifying appellant  as the  perpetrator.   As noted\n\nabove,  Ramos-Cotto testified that he  had plenty of  time to see\n\n                               -6-\n\nappellant at the time of the crime and twice thereafter.  He also\n\ntestified that  he concentrated  on appellant during  the robbery\n\nbecause appellant had the gun.  (Transcript of Jury Trial at 54).\n\nRamos-Cotto looked for appellant  in five public locations before\n\nfinding  him  at  the  grocery   store.    Appellant  had   ample\n\nopportunity  to  cross-examine   Ramos  Cotto  with   respect  to\n\nappellant's identity.  In  fact, the trial transcript  reveals at\n\nleast  twenty pages of cross-examination  on this very  issue.  A\n\njury   could  rationally   choose   to   rely  on   Ramos-Cotto's\n\nidentification.  We find no error in the ultimate verdict on this\n\nground.\n\n          Appellant's other  sufficiency argument fails  as well.\n\nAppellant  argues that  the government  failed to  show  that the\n\nsocial security checks confiscated from  appellant's co-defendant\n\nwere  the checks  that  appellant allegedly  stole.   Appellant's\n\nargument  fails  because  Ramos-Cotto  testified  that  the  four\n\ndisputed checks were among  those taken during the robbery.   Id.\n                                                                \n\nat 41-42.  He  further testified that he recognized  them because\n\nthey displayed his mail distribution route number and the date of\n\nthe robbery, and  he recognized  the names of  the addressees  as\n\nindividuals who  receive mail  on his  route.  Id.  at 41.   This\n                                                 \n\nevidence  was  sufficient to  show  that  the confiscated  social\n\nsecurity checks were taken during the robbery at issue.\n\n          Finally, after reviewing the remaining  elements of the\n\ncharges,   we  find   that  the   evidence  presented   at  trial\n\nsufficiently supported  appellant's convictions.   We affirm  the\n\n                               -7-\n\nverdict.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -8-\n</pre>",
