These  consolidated  appeals\n          SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\n                                \n\nchallenge  determinations made  by the  district court  under the\n\nfederal sentencing  guidelines.  Concluding,  as we do,  that the\n\ncourt misconstrued  its authority to depart  from a predetermined\n\nsentencing  range in  consequence  of a  defendant's  substantial\n\nassistance,  U.S.S.G.      5K1.1  (Nov.  1991),   we  remand  for\n\nresentencing.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          The instant appeals find  their genesis in the polluted\n\npolitical purlieus of Pawtucket, Rhode Island.  See, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.  Sarault,  975  F.2d 17  (1st  Cir.  1992)  (affirming\n                   \n\nracketeering sentence  with respect  to Pawtucket's mayor).   The\n\nappellants, Abel  A. Mariano, Jr. and  Barry Butterworth, secured\n\nlucrative municipal  contracts and,  in the course  of performing\n\nthe jobs,  lubricated the  wheels of  city  government by  paying\n\nunder-the-table cash stipends  to insistent municipal  officials.\n\nMariano  made periodic  payments  (perhaps totalling  as much  as\n\n$50,000) to forestall the  reassignment of sewer-line repair work\n\nto  another contractor.  Butterworth decided to play ball as part\n\nof  his effort to retain generous contracts for the renovation of\n\nMcCoy Stadium.   In all, Butterworth made a series of payments to\n\nthe ringleaders in an aggregate amount exceeding $100,000.\n\n          Appellants' payments took place over a substantial span\n\nof time.  It  was only after the  authorities started to  uncover\n\npervasive   corruption   in  the   Sarault   administration  that\n\nappellants  began cooperating  with the  U.S.  Attorney.   In the\n\n                                2\n\naftermath of this cooperative effort, the government, rather than\n\nseeking indictments,  prepared informations charging the  two men\n\nwith violating  18 U.S.C.    666(a)(2) (1988).1   The  defendants\n\npled  guilty pursuant  to plea  agreements providing  in relevant\n\npart  that the government would pursue a reduction in the offense\n\nlevel  based on  the  defendants' assistance  to law  enforcement\n\nagencies.  \n\n          Mariano  and  Butterworth  were  charged  and sentenced\n\nseparately.   In  each  instance, the  prosecution described  the\n\ndefendant's  cooperation  and  argued  for a  six-level  downward\n\ndeparture  pursuant to  U.S.S.G.    5K1.1.    The district  court\n\nrefused to depart and sentenced each defendant to  a twenty-seven\n\nmonth  prison term   an incarcerative sentence  at the top end of\n\nthe guideline sentencing range (GSR).   The government moved  for\n\nreconsideration.   In explaining  his refusal to  reconsider, the\n\ndistrict judge, referring  to and quoting  from United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nAguilar-Pena,  887 F.2d 347 (1st  Cir. 1989), stated  that he did\n            \n\nnot have discretion to depart.\n\n          In these appeals,2 appellants  claim in unison that the\n\n                    \n\n     1The  statute of conviction criminalizes \"corruptly giv[ing]\n. . .  anything of value to any person,  with intent to influence\nor reward an agent of . . . local . . . government, or any agency\nthereof, in connection with  any business, transaction, or series\nof transactions . . . involving  [$5000 or more],\" so long as the\ngovernmental  unit  in  question  receives   substantial  federal\nsubsidies.  18 U.S.C.   666(a)(2).\n\n     2Although the plea agreements  contain provisions by  virtue\nof which the defendants ostensibly waived their rights of appeal,\nthe  government has conceded that, in  the circumstances of these\ncases,  the waiver  provisions are  impuissant.   We  accept this\nconcession  uncritically.  Hence, we  take no view  of either the\n\n                                3\n\ndistrict court erred in establishing the base offense level (and,\n\nhence,  in fixing  the GSR),  that the  court misapprehended  the\n\nlegal standard governing departures under section 5K1.1, and that\n\ntheir sentences  were \"plainly unreasonable\" in  derogation of 18\n\nU.S.C.   3742(a)(4) (1988).   In addition, Mariano contends  that\n\nthe   district   court    labored   under   fundamental   factual\n\nmisconceptions and  violated the  Due Process Clause  by focusing\n\nexclusively  on  deterrence  concerns  to  the  detriment  of  an\n\nindividualized sentence.  Not to be outdone, Butterworth contends\n\nthat  the government  breached the plea  agreement by  failing to\n\nargue enthusiastically enough in support of a downward departure.\n\n          We concentrate initially  on appellants' flagship claim\n\n   the   assertion  that  the  court   below  misapprehended  the\n\ncontrolling legal  standard, thus mismeasuring the  limits of the\n\ndiscretion entrusted to  it under  section 5K1.1.   We take  this\n\ntack because, if this  claim pans out, most of  appellants' other\n\nasseverations need not be considered.\n\nII.  THE COURT'S AUTHORITY TO DEPART\n\n          We  begin our  discussion of  the court's  authority to\n\ndepart  by pondering  a jurisdictional  quandary.   That quandary\n\nresolved, we then address the merits of appellants' claim.\n\n                   A.  Appellate Jurisdiction.\n                                             \n\n          Ordinarily,  an appeal  will  not lie  from a  district\n\ncourt's refusal  to depart from a  properly calculated sentencing\n\n                    \n\nenforceability  vel non of  such waivers or  the safeguards which\n                       \nmust be employed in respect thereto.\n\n                                4\n\nrange.  See United  States v. Tardiff,  969 F.2d 1283, 1290  (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1992); United States  v. Romolo, 937 F.2d  20, 22 (1st  Cir.\n                                    \n\n1991) (collecting cases).   However,  appellate jurisdiction  may\n\nattach  when it appears that  the failure to  depart stemmed from\n\nthe  sentencing court's  mistaken impression  that it  lacked the\n\nlegal  authority  to  depart  or,  relatedly,  from  the  court's\n\nmisapprehension  of the  rules governing  departure.   See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 292 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 113\n                                                            \n\nS. Ct. 224  (1992); United States  v. Lauzon, 938  F.2d 326,  330\n                                            \n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 450 (1991); Romolo, 937 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  22.   Although this  paradigm is  dictated by  the Sentencing\n\nReform Act, see Romolo,  937 F.2d at 23 (discussing  operation of\n                      \n\n18  U.S.C.     3742(a)), it  also  works  well  from a  practical\n\nstandpoint:   in respect  to declinations to  depart, the limited\n\nappellate review that is available serves to correct errors which\n\nare   essentially  \"legal\"   in  nature,   but  does   not  brook\n\ninterference with a  sentencing court's  exercise of  factfinding\n\nfunctions or discretion.  See  Amparo, 961 F.2d at 292;  see also\n                                                                 \n\nRomolo, 937 F.2d at 23.\n      \n\n          These  appeals fit  snugly within  the contours  of the\n\nexception  permitting   appellate  review.     The  gravamen   of\n\nappellants'  complaint   is  their  colorable  claim3   that  the\n\n                    \n\n     3In what it terms \"the rarest of all cases,\" the government,\nwhich has  a duty to see  that justice is done,  Berger v. United\n                                                                 \nStates,  295 U.S.  78,  88 (1935),  argues  that the  defendants'\n      \nassignment of legal error is  on the mark.  While such  unanimity\nof  purpose might raise jurisdictional concerns  in a civil case,\nsee  Muskrat  v.   United  States,  219  U.S.  346,   361  (1911)\n                                 \n(explaining adversity requirement); see  also Moore v. Charlotte-\n                                                                 \n\n                                5\n\ndistrict court  confused the legal standard  governing departures\n\nunder  U.S.S.G.     5K1.1   with  the  legal  standard  governing\n\ndepartures  under  a  markedly  different guideline,  U.S.S.G.   \n\n5K2.0.   This claim  presents a  question  of law,  not of  fact,\n\ncomfortably  within our  assigned purview.   We  hold, therefore,\n\nthat we have jurisdiction over these appeals.\n\n        B.  The Distinction Between Departure Modalities.\n                                                        \n\n          We turn next  to the merits of the claim.   Because the\n\nassignment of error involves the parameters of a district judge's\n\ndeparture authority,  we afford plenary review.   See Lauzon, 938\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 330; cf. United States v.

(holding  that de  novo review is  warranted when  the\n                                  \n\ncourt  of appeals  is called  upon to  determine \"whether  or not\n\ncircumstances are of a  kind or degree that may  appropriately be\n\nrelied  upon to  justify departure\"  under section  5K2.0), cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 493 U.S. 862 (1989).\n      \n\n          The district judge explicitly interpreted  our decision\n\nin United States v.

See, e.g., Mariscal v. United States, 449\n                                                            \nU.S.  405 (1981) (per curiam);  Young v.

Under section\n                                      \n\n5K2.0, a district court  is empowered to depart  from the GSR  if\n\nthere  \"exists an  aggravating  or mitigating  circumstance of  a\n\nkind,  or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by\n\nthe Sentencing Commission.\"  U.S.S.G.   5K2.0  (quoting 18 U.S.C.\n\n   3553(b)).  Noting that \"the birth of the Sentencing Commission\n\nwas  to  some extent  reflective of  Congress's ardent  desire to\n\ndispense   with  inequalities   based  on   localized  sentencing\n\nresponses,\"  Aguilar-Pena, 887  F.2d  at 352,  we  held that  the\n                         \n\ndistrict  court's authority  to  depart under  section 5K2.0  was\n\nrestricted  to  those few  instances  where  there is  \"something\n\n'special' about  a given offender,  or the  accouterments of  the\n\ncrime committed,  which distinguishes the case  from the mine-run\n\nfor  that offense.\"   Id. at 350.   In  other words, Aguilar-Pena\n                                                                 \n\nreflected this court's staunch belief that section 5K2.0 operates\n\nas  a safety  valve  to  be employed  at  the  discretion of  the\n\ndistrict judge on those infrequent occasions when some important,\n\natypical  factor,   not   duly  considered   by  the   Sentencing\n\nCommission, removes  a particular case from \"the  heartland for a\n\ngiven offense.\"  Id. at 351.\n                    \n\n          U.S.S.G.     5K1.1  is  a different  provision  with  a\n\ndifferent  raison d'etre.

Diaz-Villafane.   See, e.g., Aguilar-\n                                                                 \nPena, 887 F.2d at 349-50 (citing and quoting  Diaz-Villafane, 874\n                                                            \nF.2d  at 49-52).   Like  Aguilar-Pena, Diaz-Villafane  involved a\n                                                     \ndeparture under U.S.S.G.   5K2.0.\n\n                                7\n\n          assure  that  the   guidelines  reflect   the\n          general appropriateness of  imposing a  lower\n          sentence than would otherwise  be imposed . .\n          .   to  take   into  account   a  defendant's\n          substantial  assistance in  the investigation\n          or  prosecution  of  another  person  who has\n          committed an offense.\n28  U.S.C.    994(n) (1988).

It provides, inter alia, that:\n                                        \n\n          Upon  motion of  the government  stating that\n          the   defendant   has  provided   substantial\n          assistance    in    the   investigation    or\n          prosecution   of   another  person   who  has\n          committed  an offense,  the court  may depart\n          from the guidelines.\n\nU.S.S.G.    5K1.1.   This  guideline serves  a dual purpose.   In\n\naddition to permitting ex post tailoring of defendants' sentences\n                              \n\nto reflect  meaningful assistance  rendered between the  dates of\n\napprehension and  sentencing, it  provides  defendants, ex  ante,\n                                                                \n\nwith an incentive to cooperate in the  administration of justice.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Damer, 910 F.2d 1239, 1241 (5th Cir.)\n                                 \n\n(per curiam), cert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 535 (1990).\n                          \n\n          The  methodological contrast between  the two departure\n\nmodalities is glaring.  Because section 5K2.0 in a sense operates\n\nto  promote  disparity,  the  Sentencing  Commission  strove   to\n\nminimize the  number of times it would  be invoked.  But, because\n        \n\nsection  5K1.1  operates  in  part  as  an  incentive,  promoting\n\ncooperation  with  law   enforcement  agencies,  the   Sentencing\n\nCommission strove to  maximize the  number of times  it would  be\n                              \n\ninvoked.5      These  divergent   purposes,   coupled   with  the\n\n                    \n\n     5Available  statistics reflect  the Commission's  success in\nachieving this differential.   Of 31,785 dispositions reported in\n1991,  11.9  percent involved  substantial  assistance departures\n\n                                8\n\nsignificant  linguistic differences  between the  two guidelines,\n\nclearly  indicate that  the legal  standard for  departures under\n\nsection  5K2.0  cannot  be  transplanted   into  the  substantial\n\nassistance  sphere.  The district  court, therefore, erred in its\n\nstated reliance on Aguilar-Pena.\n                               \n\n     C.

We have  not yet had\n\noccasion to discuss the way in which departure decisions ought to\n\nbe made under U.S.S.G.   5K1.1.  We do so today.\n\n          1.       Discretion.

The district\n\ncourt  is not  obligated  to  depart  downward simply  because  a\n\ngrateful  prosecutor  prefers a  lighter  sentence.

Pippin, 903  F.2d 1478, 1485  (11th Cir. 1990).\n                        \n\nPut   bluntly,  while   a  government   motion  is   a  necessary\n\nprecondition  to  a downward  departure  based  on a  defendant's\n\nsubstantial assistance, the docketing  of such a motion  does not\n\nbind a  sentencing court  to abdicate its  responsibility, stifle\n\nits independent judgment, or comply blindly with the prosecutor's\n\nwishes.\n\n          The government,  seeking a  more prominent role  in the\n\ndecisionmaking process,  points out the  Commission's advice that\n\n\"[s]ubstantial   weight  should  be  given  to  the  government's\n\nevaluation  of   the  extent   of  the  defendant's   assistance,\n\nparticularly  where the  extent and  value of the  assistance are\n\ndifficult to ascertain.\"  U.S.S.G.   5K1.1, comment. (n.3).  But,\n\nthis  advice, although sound, was  never intended to  rein in the\n\ndistrict court's  discretion concerning the need  for, and extent\n\nof,  a  downward departure  once a  government  motion is  on the\n\ntable.  See  United States  v. Castellanos, 904  F.2d 1490,  1497\n                                          \n\n(11th  Cir. 1990).   Rather,  Application Note  3 sets  forth the\n\nsuggested  degree of  deference that  should be  afforded  to the\n\nprosecution's assessment  of the facts surrounding  a defendant's\n\nassistance and intimates  that, particularly in difficult  cases,\n\nthe sentencing court ought  not to \"inquire too  intrusively into\n\nthe government's  file\" on  this delicate subject.   Spiropoulos,\n                                                                \n\n                                10\n\n976  F.2d at 163 n.5; see also  Keene, 933 F.2d at 714 (observing\n                                     \n\nthat the \"prosecutor is  in the best position to know whether the\n\ndefendant's cooperation has been helpful\").  When all is said and\n\ndone,  it  remains  the  district  judge's  decision     not  the\n\nprosecutor's   whether to depart, and if so, to what degree.\n\n          2.   Relevant Factors.   Although the  district court's\n          2.   Relevant Factors.\n                               \n\ndiscretion in  passing upon a section 5K1.1 motion is wide, it is\n\nnot unbridled.  The guideline itself provides that:\n\n          The appropriate reduction shall be determined\n          by  the  court for  reasons  stated that  may\n          include,    but    are   not    limited   to,\n          consideration of the following:\n               (1)  the  court's   evaluation  of   the\n          significance    and    usefulness   of    the\n          defendant's    assistance,     taking    into\n          consideration the  government's evaluation of\n          the assistance rendered;\n               (2) the  truthfulness, completeness, and\n          reliability of any  information or  testimony\n          provided by the defendant;\n               (3)  the   nature  and  extent   of  the\n          defendant's assistance;\n               (4) any injury  suffered, or any  danger\n          or  risk of  injury to  the defendant  or his\n          family resulting from his assistance;\n               (5)  the  timeliness of  the defendant's\n          assistance.\n\nU.S.S.G. 5K1.1.   While  the Commission's list  is representative\n\nrather  than exclusive,  the  five enumerated  factors should  be\n\nconsidered the mother lode  of substantial assistance  inquiries.\n\nA district court,  faced with a section  5K1.1 motion, must at  a\n\nbare  minimum indicate its cognizance  of these factors.   In the\n\ntypical  case the  court  would also  do  well to  make  specific\n\nfindings regarding each item.\n\n          The open-ended  nature of  the statutory list  does not\n\n                                11\n\nmean that a district court may consider any datum it pleases when\n\npassing upon a section 5K1.1 motion.  As a basis for departing, a\n\ncourt may  consider mitigating factors  only to  the extent  that\n\nthey  can  fairly be  said to  touch  upon the  degree, efficacy,\n\ntimeliness,  and  circumstances  of  a  defendant's cooperation.6\n\nSee United States  v.

After  all, the substantial assistance provision\n\nis not to be used as a mechanism for short-circuiting other, more\n\nrestrictive provisions of the  sentencing guidelines.  See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Hall, 977 F.2d 861, 865 (4th Cir. 1992).7\n              \n\n          A  somewhat different  situation obtains in  respect to\n\nthe factors  that  a court  may  consider as  a means  to  remain\n\nwithin,  or   incrementally  closer  to,  the  GSR.    Since  the\n\nsentencing range itself  is an expression  of Congress's will,  a\n\ndistrict  court  retains  broad  discretion   to  exhume  factors\n\nunrelated to substantial assistance before burying the GSR.  See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  United States  v. Mittelstadt, 969  F.2d 335,  336-37 (7th\n                                    \n\n                    \n\n     6The narrowing effect of  this circumscription should not be\nexaggerated.     The  factors  that  legitimately   relate  to  a\ndefendant's cooperation may be  many and varied.  See  U.S.S.G.  \n                                                     \n5K1.1, comment. (backg'd) (\"The  nature, extent, and significance\nof assistance can involve  a broad spectrum of conduct  that must\nbe evaluated by the court on an individual basis.\").\n\n     7As  this   logic  makes  clear,  the   government  and  the\nappellants are incorrect in suggesting here that a district court\nis  obliged  to consider  factors  such  as proportionality  when\n           \ndeciding whether,  or how much,  to depart  under section  5K1.1.\nSee United  States v. Kohl,  972 F.2d 294,  299 (9th Cir.  1992);\n                          \nRichardson, 939 F.2d at 139.\n          \n\n                                12\n\nCir.  1992) (ruling  that the  district court  did not  abuse its\n\ndiscretion  in considering  defendant's chronic  alcoholism on  a\n\nsection 5K1.1 motion); Carnes, 945 F.2d at 1014 (holding that the\n                             \n\nbenefit a defendant received  from the prosecution's decision not\n\nto  press  an  additional  charge was  a  permissible  ground for\n\nlimiting  the extent of a downward  departure).  Even if the five\n\nfactors enumerated in section 5K1.1 weigh in a defendant's favor,\n\nthe district court may, on the basis of other considerations, not\n\nconstitutionally proscribed, cf., e.g., Wade, 112 S. Ct. at 1843-\n                                            \n\n44;  United States  v.

This\n\nseeming  paradox is neither unusual nor unsettling; indeed, it is\n\nthis very  quality of unequal centrifugal  and centripetal forces\n\nthat  helps distinguish  discretionary departure  provisions like\n\nsection 5K1.1 from the  sentencing guidelines' array of mandatory\n\nadjustment  provisions like  U.S.S.G.     3E1.1  (adjustment  for\n\nacceptance  of  responsibility)  and  U.S.S.G.      3B1.1,  3B1.2\n\n(adjustment for aggravating or mitigating role in the offense).\n\n          3.

In the section 5K1.1  milieu,\n               \n\nas elsewhere,  the court of  appeals will, to  the extent of  its\n\njurisdiction, review  discretionary decisions only  for abuse  of\n\ndiscretion; and we will review the extent of a departure based on\n\nan  acceptable set of factors only to ensure reasonableness.  See\n                                                                 \n\nDiaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 49.\n              \n\n                         D.  Summing Up.\n                                       \n\n          We rule today that the legal standard for departure  is\n\nmaterially different under U.S.S.G.   5K1.1 than under U.S.S.G.  \n\n5K2.0.   A district court confronted with a government motion for\n\ndeparture  pursuant to  section 5K1.1  must consider  the factors\n\nspecifically  enumerated  in  that  guideline as  well  as  other\n\nfactors which in the  court's judgment bear on the  decision.  In\n\nso  doing,  however, the  court  must  recognize that  mitigating\n\nconcerns  are  relevant   only  insofar  as  they  relate   to  a\n\ndefendant's substantial assistance.   In all events, the district\n\ncourt retains wide discretion  concerning whether to depart under\n\nsection  5K1.1; and, if it decides that a departure is warranted,\n\nit also possesses appreciable discretion in fixing the  extent of\n\nthe departure.\n\n          In  these  cases,  the   district  court  premised  its\n\ndecision  not  to depart  on a  legal  standard designed  to hold\n\ndepartures  to a minimum    a standard  that has  no relevance in\n\nrespect to substantial assistance departures.  And, although many\n\n                                14\n\nof the integers that enter into the section 5K2.0 calculus can be\n\nconsidered  for  certain purposes  under  section  5K1.1, we  are\n\nunable confidently to say  on this record that the  judge's error\n\nwas  harmless.    Thus, we  remand  to  the  district court  with\n\ninstructions  to vacate  appellants'  sentences and  conduct  new\n\nsentencing hearings.  We see no need to require  that a different\n\njudge preside over  the resumed proceedings.   Cf., e.g.,  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Diaz-Bastardo, 929 F.2d 798, 800-01 (1st Cir. 1991).\n                       \n\nIII.  THE COURT'S CHOICE OF AN ANALOGOUS GUIDELINE\n\n          Given  the fact  that new  sentencing hearings  will be\n\nheld,  we decline,  with  one exception,  to address  appellants'\n\nother  challenges  to  the  proceedings below.8    The  exception\n\nrelates  to   appellants'  assertion  that  the  district  court,\n\nconfronted by  a lacuna  in the  guidelines,  failed properly  to\n\nselect  the  most analogous  guideline  as a  starting  point for\n\ncomputing  the GSR.  We treat  with this assertion because we can\n\nenvision no circumstances in  which a choice of this  nature will\n\nnot face the district court on remand.\n\n          We set the stage.  The Sentencing Commission has yet to\n\npromulgate  an   offense  guideline   covering  the  offense   of\n\nconviction  in these cases, i.e.,  the making of illicit payments\n                                \n\nto  a municipal official in  violation of 18  U.S.C.   666(a)(2).\n\nIn  such circumstances,  U.S.S.G.    2X5.1  directs the  district\n\n                    \n\n     8Because  we  do   not  reach  appellants'  \"reasonableness\"\nargument, we  take no  view of  the  suitability vel  non of  the\n                                                         \nsentences originally imposed.\n\n                                15\n\ncourt to  \"apply the most analogous offense  guideline\" unless no\n\n\"sufficiently  analogous guideline\"  can be  found.9   Appellants\n\nurged that U.S.S.G.   2C1.2 (dealing in part with the giving of a\n\ngratuity  to a  public official)  provided the  best basis  for a\n\ncomparison.   The  district court  rejected this  exhortation and\n\nfound U.S.S.G.    2C1.1 (dealing  with bribery of,  and extortion\n\nby, public officials) to be the most analogous guideline.\n\n          We  discern no  error  in this  determination.   Before\n\nexplaining  our   reasoning,  however,   we  first   address  the\n\nappropriate standard of appellate review.\n\n                     A.  Standard of Review.\n                                           \n\n          An appellate  tribunal must \"give due  deference to the\n\ndistrict court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\"  18\n\nU.S.C.   3742(e)  (1988).   We have interpreted  this statute  as\n\nrequiring,  in most instances, that the court of appeals review a\n\ntrial court's application of a sentencing  guideline to the facts\n\nonly for clear error.  See, e.g., United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n499, 507  (1st Cir. 1990); United States v. Wright, 873 F.2d 437,\n                                                  \n\n444  (1st Cir.  1989).    The  propriety  of  using  the  clearly\n\nerroneous  standard   in   scrutinizing  a   sentencing   court's\n\n                    \n\n     9In  the court  below, appellants  argued that  a particular\noffense guideline,  U.S.S.G.     2C1.2, was  a  better  fit  than\nU.S.S.G.   2C1.1 (the offense guideline deemed most comparable by\nthe  district judge).   On appeal,  Butterworth attempts  for the\nfirst  time   to  raise  the  different  issue   of  whether  any\n                                                                 \nsufficiently analogous guideline exists.  This issue has not been\nproperly preserved  for appellate review.   See United  States v.\n                                                              \nSlade,     F.2d    ,      (1st Cir. 1992) [No. 92-1176, slip  op.\n     \nat 6] (reiterating the established rule that points not argued in\nthe  district  court  cannot be  raised  for  the  first time  on\nappeal).\n\n                                16\n\napplication of law  to fact  will depend largely  on whether  the\n\nquestion presented  is essentially factual or  essentially legal;\n\nthe  more fact-dominated the question, the more likely it is that\n\nclear-error review  will be  appropriate.   See United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nOrtiz,  878 F.2d  125, 126-27  (3d Cir.  1989); United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nDaughtrey,  874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir. 1989); see also Roland\n                                                                 \n\nM. v.  Concord School Comm., 910 F.2d 983, 990-91 (1st Cir. 1990)\n                           \n\n(discussing desirability of clear-error review in instances where\n\na district court must find the facts and then make  an evaluative\n\njudgment, applying a defined legal standard to the facts),  cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 111 S. Ct. 1122 (1991).\n      \n\n          In  these cases, a series of  factors suggests that the\n\ncontested  issue lies  closer to  the fact-intensive  end  of the\n\ncontinuum:    there  is  no indication  that  the  district court\n\nmisunderstood the  choices presented under the  guidelines; there\n\nis  no  articulation of  a dispute  concerning  the reach  of the\n\nprovisions  proffered  as  suitable  analogs;  and  there  is  no\n\nnecessity for us, in resolving  the controversy, to determine the\n\nfar  broader  (and  essentially  legal)  question  of  whether  a\n\nparticular offense guideline will always  be most analogous to 18\n                                        \n\nU.S.C.   666(a)(2).  Simply stated, the issue before the district\n\ncourt  was whether  appellants' actions  in \"corruptly  giv[ing]\"\n\npayoffs  to  municipal officials  \"with  intent  to influence  or\n\nreward\"  those officials  in connection  with city  contracts, 18\n\nU.S.C.     666(a)(2), were  more  akin to  providing  a gratuity,\n\nU.S.S.G.    2C1.2,  than to  passing a  bribe, U.S.S.G.    2C1.1.\n\n                                17\n\nThis issue is  essentially factual.   It required  the court,  in\n\neffect,  to  find  the  facts   pertaining  to  the  offenses  of\n\nconviction and make  evaluative judgments concerning those  facts\n\n(including  a judgment  as to  whether appellants'  payments were\n\nintended to  \"influence,\" rather than  \"reward,\" city officials).\n\nAccordingly,   we  apply   the  clearly  erroneous   standard  of\n\nreview.10\n\n                   B.  The Appropriate Analogy.\n                                              \n\n          The essential difference between a bribe and an illegal\n\ngratuity is the intention of the bribe-giver to effect a quid pro\n                                                                 \n\nquo.  See United States  v. Muldoon, 931 F.2d 282, 287  (4th Cir.\n                                   \n\n1991).  Hence, a bribery guideline, section 2C1.1, applies when a\n\ntransfer  of money  has \"a  corrupt purpose,  such as  inducing a\n\npublic official to  participate in  a fraud or  to influence  his\n\nofficial actions.\"   U.S.S.G.    2C1.1, comment. (backg'd).   The\n\ngratuity provision, on the other hand, does not include a corrupt\n\npurpose as  an element of  the offense.   See  U.S.S.G.    2C1.2,\n                                             \n\ncomment. (backg'd).\n\n                    \n\n     10In the event  no sufficiently analogous  guideline exists,\nthe  sentencing  court  must  resort to  the  general  principles\nadumbrated  in 18 U.S.C.   3553(b) (1988) (providing that, in the\nabsence  of  an offense  guideline,  the  court  shall impose  an\n\"appropriate\" sentence,  having due  regard for, inter  alia, the\n                                                            \ngravity  of the  offense;  the need  for punishment,  deterrence,\nretraining, and the like; and  \"the relationship of the  sentence\nimposed to sentences prescribed  by [other] guidelines . .  . and\nthe applicable policy statements of  the Sentencing Commission\").\nBecause that scenario  has no bearing here, see supra  note 9, we\n                                                     \nfind inapposite the standard of review limned in United States v.\n                                                              \nGabay,  923 F.2d 1536, 1545  (11th Cir. 1991)  (employing de novo\n                                                                 \nreview where  defendant contended that  no sufficiently analogous\nguideline existed).\n\n                                18\n\n          This distinction between the  two offense guidelines is\n\nbrought into bold relief by  the differences between the statutes\n\nto  which the guidelines relate.   The bribery guideline applies,\n\nfor example, to the offense of \"corruptly giv[ing] . . . anything\n\nof value\" to a federal official with the intent of \"influenc[ing]\n\nany  official act\" or \"inducing\"  the official to  violate his or\n\nher  lawful duty.   18  U.S.C.    201(b)(1)  (1988).   This seems\n\nvirtually  to mirror the statute of conviction here, which, among\n\nother things, criminalizes \"corruptly giv[ing]  . . . anything of\n\nvalue  to any  person, with  intent to  influence\" a  decision of\n\nstate or local  government.  18 U.S.C.    666(a)(2).  The  common\n\nthread  that  runs through  both statutes  is  the intent  of the\n\npayer, by the greasing  of palms, to affect the future actions of\n\na public official.  In contrast, the gratuity guideline refers to\n\ncrimes of a somewhat  different genre.  It applies,  for example,\n\nto persons who  give things of value to federal  officers \"for or\n\nbecause of any official act performed or to be  performed by such\n\npublic official.\"   18  U.S.C.    201(c)(1)(A) (1988).   Notably,\n\nunder the gratuity  guideline, there is  no requirement that  the\n\ngift be \"corruptly\" given  with the intent to affect  the payee's\n\nmindset or actions.  Phrased another way, the  gratuity guideline\n\npresumes a situation in which the offender gives the gift without\n\nattaching any  strings,  intending it  instead  as a  reward  for\n\nactions  the public  official  has already  taken  or is  already\n\ncommitted to take.\n\n          With these distinctions in mind, appellants' contention\n\n                                19\n\nis easily dispelled.   Here, Mariano admitted that he  paid large\n\nsums  of  money  in  order   to  forestall  city  officials  from\n\nreassigning  the work.    Butterworth likewise  admitted that  he\n\nforked  over $100,000 so that  he could retain valuable contracts\n\nwhich Pawtucket might otherwise  have redirected to a competitor.\n\nSince Mariano and Butterworth  each sought to receive a  quid pro\n                                                                 \n\nquo, in the form  of future (favorable) treatment, and  since the\n   \n\noffenses to  which they  pleaded guilty involved  corrupt intent,\n\nthe district  court's determination that their  actions were more\n\nakin  to  bribe-giving  than   to  gift-giving  was  not  clearly\n\nerroneous.\n\n          To be sure, appellants  protest that they were victims,\n\nnot  perpetrators,  of  an  extortionate scheme,  and  that  they\n\nreceived nothing extra in  return for their magnanimity.   We are\n\nunmoved  by these  plaints.   The fact  that appellants,  in some\n\nsense, may have  been the quarry of a pack  of venal politicians,\n\nand did not themselves  initiate the forbidden transactions, does\n\nnot negate  the district court's  choice of a  guideline analogy.\n\nBribery and extortion are not mutually exclusive concepts.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  United States v. Hathaway,  534 F.2d 386,  395 (1st Cir.),\n                                \n\ncert. denied, 429  U.S. 819 (1976).  And the fact that appellants\n            \n\nhad already  received sewer-line and stadium  repair contracts at\n\npayoff time  is  also not  outcome  determinative.   Despite  the\n\nchronology,  the  district  court  could  supportably  find  that\n\nMariano and Butterworth corruptly intended their illicit payments\n\nto influence the  future actions of the late,  unlamented Sarault\n\n                                20\n\nadministration.\n\n          We  need go no further.   Having willingly  sat down to\n\nsup  with the devil, appellants  cannot now expect  the courts to\n\nswallow their tale uncritically.  The guideline analogy chosen by\n\nthe  district  court was  well within  its  purview.   See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

BACKGROUND\n\n          The instant appeals find  their genesis in the polluted\n\npolitical purlieus of Pawtucket, Rhode Island.  See, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.

The\n\nappellants, Abel  A. Mariano, Jr. and  Barry Butterworth, secured\n\nlucrative municipal  contracts and,  in the course  of performing\n\nthe jobs,  lubricated the  wheels of  city  government by  paying\n\nunder-the-table cash stipends  to insistent municipal  officials.\n\nMariano  made periodic  payments  (perhaps totalling  as much  as\n\n$50,000) to forestall the  reassignment of sewer-line repair work\n\nto  another contractor.  Butterworth decided to play ball as part\n\nof  his effort to retain generous contracts for the renovation of\n\nMcCoy Stadium.   In all, Butterworth made a series of payments to\n\nthe ringleaders in an aggregate amount exceeding $100,000.\n\n          Appellants' payments took place over a substantial span\n\nof time.  It  was only after the  authorities started to  uncover\n\npervasive   corruption   in  the   Sarault   administration  that\n\nappellants  began cooperating  with the  U.S.  Attorney.   In the\n\n                                2\n\naftermath of this cooperative effort, the government, rather than\n\nseeking indictments,  prepared informations charging the  two men\n\nwith violating  18 U.S.C.    666(a)(2) (1988).1   The  defendants\n\npled  guilty pursuant  to plea  agreements providing  in relevant\n\npart  that the government would pursue a reduction in the offense\n\nlevel  based on  the  defendants' assistance  to law  enforcement\n\nagencies.  \n\n          Mariano  and  Butterworth  were  charged  and sentenced\n\nseparately.   In  each  instance, the  prosecution described  the\n\ndefendant's  cooperation  and  argued  for a  six-level  downward\n\ndeparture  pursuant to  U.S.S.G.    5K1.1.    The district  court\n\nrefused to depart and sentenced each defendant to  a twenty-seven\n\nmonth  prison term   an incarcerative sentence  at the top end of\n\nthe guideline sentencing range (GSR).   The government moved  for\n\nreconsideration.   In explaining  his refusal to  reconsider, the\n\ndistrict judge, referring  to and quoting  from United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nAguilar-Pena,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530534\"><a href=\"/opinion/530534/united-states-v-jorge-armando-aguilar-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st  Cir. 1989), stated  that he did\n            \n\nnot have discretion to depart.\n\n          In these appeals,2 appellants  claim in unison that the\n\n                    \n\n     1The  statute of conviction criminalizes \"corruptly giv[ing]\n. . .  anything of value to any person,  with intent to influence\nor reward an agent of . . . local . . . government, or any agency\nthereof, in connection with  any business, transaction, or series\nof transactions . . . involving  [$5000 or more],\" so long as the\ngovernmental  unit  in  question  receives   substantial  federal\nsubsidies.  18 U.S.C.   666(a)(2).\n\n     2Although the plea agreements  contain provisions by  virtue\nof which the defendants ostensibly waived their rights of appeal,\nthe  government has conceded that, in  the circumstances of these\ncases,  the waiver  provisions are  impuissant.

In addition, Mariano contends  that\n\nthe   district   court    labored   under   fundamental   factual\n\nmisconceptions and  violated the  Due Process Clause  by focusing\n\nexclusively  on  deterrence  concerns  to  the  detriment  of  an\n\nindividualized sentence.  Not to be outdone, Butterworth contends\n\nthat  the government  breached the plea  agreement by  failing to\n\nargue enthusiastically enough in support of a downward departure.\n\n          We concentrate initially  on appellants' flagship claim\n\n   the   assertion  that  the  court   below  misapprehended  the\n\ncontrolling legal  standard, thus mismeasuring the  limits of the\n\ndiscretion entrusted to  it under  section 5K1.1.   We take  this\n\ntack because, if this  claim pans out, most of  appellants' other\n\nasseverations need not be considered.\n\nII.

Because section 5K2.0 in a sense operates\n\nto  promote  disparity,  the  Sentencing  Commission  strove   to\n\nminimize the  number of times it would  be invoked.

While  the Commission's list  is representative\n\nrather  than exclusive,  the  five enumerated  factors should  be\n\nconsidered the mother lode  of substantial assistance  inquiries.\n\nA district court,  faced with a section  5K1.1 motion, must at  a\n\nbare  minimum indicate its cognizance  of these factors.   In the\n\ntypical  case the  court  would also  do  well to  make  specific\n\nfindings regarding each item.\n\n          The open-ended  nature of  the statutory list  does not\n\n                                11\n\nmean that a district court may consider any datum it pleases when\n\npassing upon a section 5K1.1 motion.  As a basis for departing, a\n\ncourt may  consider mitigating factors  only to  the extent  that\n\nthey  can  fairly be  said to  touch  upon the  degree, efficacy,\n\ntimeliness,  and  circumstances  of  a  defendant's cooperation.6\n\nSee United States  v.

Summing Up.\n                                       \n\n          We rule today that the legal standard for departure  is\n\nmaterially different under U.S.S.G.   5K1.1 than under U.S.S.G.  \n\n5K2.0.   A district court confronted with a government motion for\n\ndeparture  pursuant to  section 5K1.1  must consider  the factors\n\nspecifically  enumerated  in  that  guideline as  well  as  other\n\nfactors which in the  court's judgment bear on the  decision.  In\n\nso  doing,  however, the  court  must  recognize that  mitigating\n\nconcerns  are  relevant   only  insofar  as  they  relate   to  a\n\ndefendant's substantial assistance.   In all events, the district\n\ncourt retains wide discretion  concerning whether to depart under\n\nsection  5K1.1; and, if it decides that a departure is warranted,\n\nit also possesses appreciable discretion in fixing the  extent of\n\nthe departure.\n\n          In  these  cases,  the   district  court  premised  its\n\ndecision  not  to depart  on a  legal  standard designed  to hold\n\ndepartures  to a minimum    a standard  that has  no relevance in\n\nrespect to substantial assistance departures.  And, although many\n\n                                14\n\nof the integers that enter into the section 5K2.0 calculus can be\n\nconsidered  for  certain purposes  under  section  5K1.1, we  are\n\nunable confidently to say  on this record that the  judge's error\n\nwas  harmless.    Thus, we  remand  to  the  district court  with\n\ninstructions  to vacate  appellants'  sentences and  conduct  new\n\nsentencing hearings.  We see no need to require  that a different\n\njudge preside over  the resumed proceedings.   Cf., e.g.,  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.

The Sentencing Commission has yet to\n\npromulgate  an   offense  guideline   covering  the  offense   of\n\nconviction  in these cases, i.e.,  the making of illicit payments\n                                \n\nto  a municipal official in  violation of 18  U.S.C.   666(a)(2).\n\nIn  such circumstances,  U.S.S.G.    2X5.1  directs the  district\n\n                    \n\n     8Because  we  do   not  reach  appellants'  \"reasonableness\"\nargument, we  take no  view of  the  suitability vel  non of  the\n                                                         \nsentences originally imposed.\n\n                                15\n\ncourt to  \"apply the most analogous offense  guideline\" unless no\n\n\"sufficiently  analogous guideline\"  can be  found.9   Appellants\n\nurged that U.S.S.G.   2C1.2 (dealing in part with the giving of a\n\ngratuity  to a  public official)  provided the  best basis  for a\n\ncomparison.   The  district court  rejected this  exhortation and\n\nfound U.S.S.G.    2C1.1 (dealing  with bribery of,  and extortion\n\nby, public officials) to be the most analogous guideline.\n\n          We  discern no  error  in this  determination.   Before\n\nexplaining  our   reasoning,  however,   we  first   address  the\n\nappropriate standard of appellate review.\n\n                     A.  Standard of Review.\n                                           \n\n          An appellate  tribunal must \"give due  deference to the\n\ndistrict court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\"  18\n\nU.S.C.   3742(e)  (1988).   We have interpreted  this statute  as\n\nrequiring,  in most instances, that the court of appeals review a\n\ntrial court's application of a sentencing  guideline to the facts\n\nonly for clear error.

The  propriety  of  using  the  clearly\n\nerroneous  standard   in   scrutinizing  a   sentencing   court's\n\n                    \n\n     9In  the court  below, appellants  argued that  a particular\noffense guideline,  U.S.S.G.     2C1.2, was  a  better  fit  than\nU.S.S.G.   2C1.1 (the offense guideline deemed most comparable by\nthe  district judge).   On appeal,  Butterworth attempts  for the\nfirst  time   to  raise  the  different  issue   of  whether  any\n                                                                 \nsufficiently analogous guideline exists.

Simply stated, the issue before the district\n\ncourt  was whether  appellants' actions  in \"corruptly  giv[ing]\"\n\npayoffs  to  municipal officials  \"with  intent  to influence  or\n\nreward\"  those officials  in connection  with city  contracts, 18\n\nU.S.C.     666(a)(2), were  more  akin to  providing  a gratuity,\n\nU.S.S.G.    2C1.2,  than to  passing a  bribe, U.S.S.G.    2C1.1.\n\n                                17\n\nThis issue is  essentially factual.   It required  the court,  in\n\neffect,  to  find  the  facts   pertaining  to  the  offenses  of\n\nconviction and make  evaluative judgments concerning those  facts\n\n(including  a judgment  as to  whether appellants'  payments were\n\nintended to  \"influence,\" rather than  \"reward,\" city officials).\n\nAccordingly,   we  apply   the  clearly  erroneous   standard  of\n\nreview.10\n\n                   B.  The Appropriate Analogy.\n                                              \n\n          The essential difference between a bribe and an illegal\n\ngratuity is the intention of the bribe-giver to effect a quid pro\n                                                                 \n\nquo.

Hence, a bribery guideline, section 2C1.1, applies when a\n\ntransfer  of money  has \"a  corrupt purpose,  such as  inducing a\n\npublic official to  participate in  a fraud or  to influence  his\n\nofficial actions.\"   U.S.S.G.    2C1.1, comment. (backg'd).   The\n\ngratuity provision, on the other hand, does not include a corrupt\n\npurpose as  an element of  the offense.   See  U.S.S.G.    2C1.2,\n                                             \n\ncomment.

The bribery guideline applies,\n\nfor example, to the offense of \"corruptly giv[ing] . . . anything\n\nof value\" to a federal official with the intent of \"influenc[ing]\n\nany  official act\" or \"inducing\"  the official to  violate his or\n\nher  lawful duty.   18  U.S.C.    201(b)(1)  (1988).   This seems\n\nvirtually  to mirror the statute of conviction here, which, among\n\nother things, criminalizes \"corruptly giv[ing]  . . . anything of\n\nvalue  to any  person, with  intent to  influence\" a  decision of\n\nstate or local  government.  18 U.S.C.    666(a)(2).  The  common\n\nthread  that  runs through  both statutes  is  the intent  of the\n\npayer, by the greasing  of palms, to affect the future actions of\n\na public official.  In contrast, the gratuity guideline refers to\n\ncrimes of a somewhat  different genre.  It applies,  for example,\n\nto persons who  give things of value to federal  officers \"for or\n\nbecause of any official act performed or to be  performed by such\n\npublic official.\"   18  U.S.C.    201(c)(1)(A) (1988).   Notably,\n\nunder the gratuity  guideline, there is  no requirement that  the\n\ngift be \"corruptly\" given  with the intent to affect  the payee's\n\nmindset or actions.  Phrased another way, the  gratuity guideline\n\npresumes a situation in which the offender gives the gift without\n\nattaching any  strings,  intending it  instead  as a  reward  for\n\nactions  the public  official  has already  taken  or is  already\n\ncommitted to take.\n\n          With these distinctions in mind, appellants' contention\n\n                                19\n\nis easily dispelled.   Here, Mariano admitted that he  paid large\n\nsums  of  money  in  order   to  forestall  city  officials  from\n\nreassigning  the work.    Butterworth likewise  admitted that  he\n\nforked  over $100,000 so that  he could retain valuable contracts\n\nwhich Pawtucket might otherwise  have redirected to a competitor.\n\nSince Mariano and Butterworth  each sought to receive a  quid pro\n                                                                 \n\nquo, in the form  of future (favorable) treatment, and  since the\n   \n\noffenses to  which they  pleaded guilty involved  corrupt intent,\n\nthe district  court's determination that their  actions were more\n\nakin  to  bribe-giving  than   to  gift-giving  was  not  clearly\n\nerroneous.\n\n          To be sure, appellants  protest that they were victims,\n\nnot  perpetrators,  of  an  extortionate scheme,  and  that  they\n\nreceived nothing extra in  return for their magnanimity.   We are\n\nunmoved  by these  plaints.   The fact  that appellants,  in some\n\nsense, may have  been the quarry of a pack  of venal politicians,\n\nand did not themselves  initiate the forbidden transactions, does\n\nnot negate  the district court's  choice of a  guideline analogy.\n\nBribery and extortion are not mutually exclusive concepts.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  United States v. Hathaway,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"335047\"><a href=\"/opinion/335047/united-states-v-stephen-hathaway-united-states-of-america-v-howard/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  395 (1st Cir.),\n                                \n\ncert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976).  And the fact that appellants\n            \n\nhad already  received sewer-line and stadium  repair contracts at\n\npayoff time  is  also not  outcome  determinative.   Despite  the\n\nchronology,  the  district  court  could  supportably  find  that\n\nMariano and Butterworth corruptly intended their illicit payments\n\nto influence the  future actions of the late,  unlamented Sarault\n\n                                20\n\nadministration.\n\n          We  need go no further.   Having willingly  sat down to\n\nsup  with the devil, appellants  cannot now expect  the courts to\n\nswallow their tale uncritically.  The guideline analogy chosen by\n\nthe  district  court was  well within  its  purview.   See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.
