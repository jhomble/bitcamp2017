Plaintiff-appellant    Angela\n\nDiGregorio appeals the district court's judgment in favor of\n\ndefendants-appellees   Hartford    Comprehensive   Employee   Benefit\n\nService Company (\"Hartford\") and PricewaterhouseCoopers Long Term\n\nDisability Plan (\"the Plan\") on her claim of entitlement to long-\n\nterm disability (\"LTD\") benefits under the Employee Retirement\n\nIncome Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C § 1001-1461, as amended\n\n(\"ERISA\").   DiGregorio challenges only the district court's denial\n\nof her alternate prayer for relief requesting a remand to Hartford,\n\nthe Plan administrator, for supplementation of the administrative\n\nrecord, on the ground that Hartford and the Plan failed to provide\n\na reasonable opportunity for full and fair review of her benefits\n\nclaim in violation of ERISA § 503, 29 U.S.C. § 1133, and its\n\nimplementing regulations.    Because the district court did not err\n\nin determining that a remand was unwarranted on the facts of this\n\ncase, we affirm the district court's judgment.1\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Hartford and the Plan filed a notice of cross-appeal but\nacknowledge in their answering brief that they do not challenge any\nof the district court's factual findings or legal conclusions, and\nthat they seek affirmance of the district court's judgment. We\ntherefore deem all arguments on the cross-appeal to be forfeited\nand dismiss the cross-appeal, No. 04-2252. DiGregorio's February\n23, 2005 motion to order the cross-appeal \"denied as waived\" is\ndenied as moot. See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n                                  -2-\n\f                                         I.\n\n             The facts of this case are set forth in detail in the\n\ndistrict court's opinion. See DiGregorio v. PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nLong Term Disability Plan, No. 03-11191, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n\n15485 (D. Mass. Aug. 9, 2004).                  We relate only those facts,\n\nundisputed unless otherwise noted, that are relevant to this\n\nappeal.\n\nA.           DiGregorio's Claim for LTD Benefits\n\n             DiGregorio worked as a secretary for Coopers & Lybrand\n\n(now PricewaterhouseCoopers) from September 1988 through early\n\nFebruary 1995, when she began receiving worker's compensation.                   In\n\nJuly 1995, DiGregorio applied for LTD benefits under the Coopers &\n\nLybrand Employee Long Term Disability and Income Plan, now the\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Long Term Disability Plan.                  In support of\n\nher claim, she submitted a statement by her attending physician,\n\nDr. Walsh, diagnosing DiGregorio with bilateral carpal tunnel\n\nsyndrome that totally disabled her from performing her job as a\n\nsecretary.        The Plan administrator, then the Pacific Mutual Life\n\nInsurance Company, approved DiGregorio's claim in September 1995,\n\nand    DiGregorio        began    receiving    LTD   benefits   for   the     period\n\nbeginning August 1, 1995.\n\n             Under the terms of the Plan, DiGregorio was entitled to\n\nLTD benefits for \"Total Disability\" for a period of up to two years\n\nso    long   as    she    could    \"perform    no    duty   pertaining   to   [her]\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\foccupation\" as a secretary.       DiGregorio was entitled to continue\n\nreceiving benefits beyond the two-year period only so long as she\n\ncould \"perform no duty pertaining not only to [her] occupation but\n\nto any occupation . . . for which [she] is, or may be, qualified by\n\neducation, training or expertise\" (emphasis added).            DiGregorio\n\ncontinued to receive LTD benefits beyond the initial two-year\n\nperiod.\n\nB.        Hartford's Termination of DiGregorio's LTD Benefits\n\n          In July 1999, PricewaterhouseCoopers retained Hartford to\n\nadminister claims for benefits under the Plan.          In August 1999, at\n\nHartford's   request,    DiGregorio   completed    an   \"Authorization   to\n\nObtain and Release Information\" permitting Hartford to periodically\n\nobtain DiGregorio's updated medical information so that Hartford\n\ncould verify her disability status and eligibility for benefits.\n\n          On April 18, 2001, Hartford notified DiGregorio by letter\n\nthat \"the evidence submitted in support of your claim does not\n\nestablish that you meet the Plan definition of Total Disability on\n\nor after April 16, 2001.\"       Hartford stated that it had based its\n\n\"decision to deny your claim for benefits upon Plan language and\n\nall documents contained in your claim file, viewed as a whole.\"\n\n          Hartford      then   identified   four    specific   pieces    of\n\ninformation that it had considered: (1) \"Medical records received\n\nfrom [an orthopedic surgeon,] Douglas Howard, M.D.[,] regarding\n\nyour April 11, 2000 evaluation,\" (2) \"Employability Analysis Report\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fcompleted . . . on March 22, 2001,\" (3) \"Telephone conversation\n\nwith you on November 28, 2000,\" and (4) \"Telephone conversation\n\nwith you on February 5, 2001.\"\n\n            Hartford explained:\n\n            The medical record completed by Dr. Howard on\n            April 11, 2000 indicates that you are capable\n            of working full time in an occupation that\n            does not require repetitive use of your hands.\n            Dr. Howard states that he does not find you\n            totally disabled but only partially disabled.\n            He indicates that you would be capable of\n            performing a sedentary job on a full time\n            basis that did not require repetitive use of\n            your hands.\n\nHartford noted that although DiGregorio had indicated in the\n\ntelephone    conversations   that    she    \"would    have    [a   different\n\nphysician,] Dr. Jupiter[,] send medical information [to Hartford]\n\nconcerning [her] condition[,] [t]o date, this information has not\n\nbeen received.   We do not have sufficient medical documentation to\n\nverify continued disability.\"\n\n            Finally,   Hartford   stated:    \"We     have    identified   the\n\nfollowing positions that you could perform based on your abilities\n\nas identified by Dr. Howard.        These positions are both sedentary\n\nand do not require repetitive use of the hands.\"              The positions\n\nwere: \"Customer-Complaint Clerk,\" \"Insurance Clerk,\" \"Information\n\nClerk, and \"Counter Clerk.\"         Hartford determined that because\n\nDiGregorio could perform duties pertaining to these occupations,\n\n\"for which [she was], or may be, qualified by education, training\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\for expertise,\" she did not meet the Plan definition of Total\n\nDisability and was not entitled to LTD benefits.\n\n            Hartford   then   reiterated:     \"In   reviewing    your   claim,\n\n[Hartford] considered your claim file as a whole for purposes of\n\ndetermining your eligibility [for] benefits under the Policy.\"\n\nHartford concluded the denial letter by describing DiGregorio's\n\nrights \"to appeal our decision and review pertinent documents in\n\nyour claim file,\" as well as to submit\n\n            additional    information    not    previously\n            submitted which you believe will assist us in\n            evaluating your claim for Long Term Disability\n            benefits, . . . .     [s]pecifically, medical\n            documentation that you are unable to perform\n            any occupation or work due to your abilities,\n            training,   education   and   experience,   or\n            documentation that you have a Disability which\n            prevents    you    from    performing    other\n            occupations.\n\nC.          DiGregorio's Requests for Her Entire Claim File\n\n            In a letter dated September 25, 2001, DiGregorio informed\n\nHartford, through counsel, of her intent to appeal Hartford's\n\ndecision to terminate her benefits and requested copies of \"all\n\ndocuments upon which [Hartford] ha[d] relied . . . in making [its]\n\nunfavorable   determination,\"     namely,     her   \"entire     claim   file,\"\n\nincluding   \"[a]ny     reports   or   other   documents   relating      to   or\n\nconnected with a review of Ms. Di[G]regorio's medical records by a\n\nmember of your medical department, or outside consultant.\"\n\n            That same day, September 25, 2001, Hartford provided\n\ncopies of (1) an Employability Analysis Report prepared by a\n\n                                      -6-\n\fHartford rehabilitation clinical case manager, dated March 22,\n\n2001,   which    identified      the    four   \"Clerk\"    occupations     Hartford\n\nalleged DiGregorio could perform, and (2) Dr. Howard's Follow-Up\n\nOrthopedic Evaluation based on his April 11, 2000 examination of\n\nDiGregorio, which documented her medical history and the results of\n\nhis examination.        According to the Evaluation, Dr. Howard made the\n\nfollowing recommendation:\n\n            At this time I do not find [DiGregorio]\n            totally disabled but only partially disabled.\n            She should have no repetitive activities or\n            repetitive use of the hands, but this would\n            allow any type of sedentary occupation that\n            was non-repetitive. . . .\n\n            DiGregorio repeated her request for her entire claim file\n\nby letter from her counsel dated October 1, 2001.                     By letter of\n\nOctober 8, 2001, Hartford responded that \"we cannot release any\n\ndocuments contained in Ms. Di[G]regorio's claim file that are not\n\npertinent   to    the    denial    of    her   claim.      The    documents   that\n\naccompanied our September 25, 2001 letter are those that were used\n\nin making our determination.\"\n\n            DiGregorio made a third request for her entire claim file\n\nthrough counsel by letter dated October 25, 2001, stating, \"it is\n\nour position that you must have, and indeed should have, considered\n\nMs.   DiGregorio's      entire    claim    file   in     making   a   decision   to\n\nterminate benefits on this claim . . . .           We believe Ms. DiGregorio\n\nis deprived [of] a full and fair review of her claim absent the\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fprovision of these materials.\"    Hartford's reply by letter dated\n\nOctober 30, 2001 stated:\n\n          While Ms. DiGregorio's entire claim file has\n          certainly been reviewed, the documents that\n          pertain to the denial of her claim are . . .\n          the Employability Analysis Report of 03/22/01\n          and the 04/11/01 evaluation by Dr. Douglas\n          Howard. The most recent medical documentation\n          we have on file indicates that Ms. DiGregorio\n          is not Totally Disabled from any occupation,\n          and, therefore, that is information used in\n          making our determination to deny benefits.\n\nD.        DiGregorio's Appeal to Hartford\n\n          In her appeal letter to Hartford through counsel on\n\nNovember 8, 2001, DiGregorio presented her arguments in support of\n\nher claim to benefits, including her challenges to the accuracy and\n\nreliability of Dr. Howard's recommendation and the results of the\n\nEmployability Analysis Report. DiGregorio also provided additional\n\nmaterials for Hartford's review, including: (1) a laboratory report\n\nfrom Massachusetts General Hospital showing the results of an\n\nElectromyography (\"EMG\") test conducted on DiGregorio on November\n\n29, 2000, (2) a February 6, 2001 letter to DiGregorio from Dr.\n\nJupiter, (3) a July 31, 2001 treatment note made by Dr. Jupiter,\n\nand (4) an October 12, 2001 letter to DiGregorio's attorney from\n\nDr. Jupiter.\n\n          Dr. Jupiter's letter to DiGregorio of February 6, 2001\n\nstated that \"electrical evaluation of your hand and wrist . . .\n\nshows substantial and serious compression of the median nerves in\n\nthe carpal tunnel. . . .   I believe that the problem can affect\n\n                                 -8-\n\fyour ability to function and that you have at least for the present\n\nan ongoing disability as a result of this.\"                     His treatment note of\n\nJuly 31, 2001 stated that \"an EMG and nerve conduction study . . .\n\nafforded a compressive neuropathy in the median nerve.                                 This\n\ninterferes with [DiGregorio's] ability to function.                         She remains\n\ndisabled because of this and will do so on a continued basis unless\n\nintervention proves successful. . . .                 Her prognosis is guarded.\"\n\nDr. Jupiter's letter to DiGregorio's attorney of October 12, 2001\n\nstated:       \"An    EMG    and   nerve      conduction        study    confirm[]      that\n\n[DiGregorio] still has dysfunction of her nerve.                        On the basis of\n\nthis    and    her    symptoms       she   continues      to    be     disabled   in   her\n\nsecretarial line of work and feels that she is unable to perform\n\nbimanual tasks in any form of work.\"\n\n               Although      DiGregorio      did   not    request       copies    of   any\n\ndocuments considered during Hartford's review of her appeal in her\n\nNovember       8,    2001    letter,       she   reiterated       her    position      that\n\nHartford's failure \"to provide her entire claim file in response to\n\nher request for copies of documents 'pertinent' to the denial of\n\nher claim eviscerates her right to a full and fair review of this\n\nclaim under ERISA.\"\n\n               Hartford upheld its termination of DiGregorio's claim for\n\nLTD    benefits      by     letter    on   December      12,    2001,     based   on   its\n\nconsideration of \"Plan language and all documents contained in\n\n[DiGregorio's] claim file,\" including the additional information\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\fDiGregorio had submitted with her appeal letter.                Hartford first\n\nnoted that DiGregorio did not appear to be under the regular care\n\nof a physician, as required by the Plan.          Hartford then addressed\n\nDiGregorio's disability status, explaining that \"[t]he testing and\n\nother medical documentation supplied does support an inability to\n\nuse her hands in a repetitive manner.      However, there is no medical\n\ndocumentation to support her inability to perform an occupation\n\nthat does not require repetitive hand motion,\" such as any of the\n\nfour   \"Clerk\"   occupations    identified   in     the    March     22,    2001\n\nEmployability Analysis Report.\n\n           Hartford   also     indicated   that    it     had    reviewed     an\n\nadditional document not submitted by DiGregorio, namely, a \"Report\n\nfrom Dr. Jesse Jupiter, received in our office 12/06/01.\" Hartford\n\nexplained:\n\n           In   an  attempt   to   further   clarify  Ms.\n           Di[Gre]gorio's    functional    capacity,   [a\n           registered nurse employed by Hartford] sent a\n           letter to Dr. Jupiter with specific questions\n           related to her disability and functional\n           ability.   When asked if he agreed with the\n           restrictions identified by Dr. Howard of\n           04/11/00, Dr. Jupiter responded affirmatively.\n           If you recall, Dr. Howard stated that Ms.\n           Di[G]regorio is capable of full-time work in\n           an occupation that does not require repetitive\n           use of her hands.\n\nE.         Proceedings in District Court\n\n           On October 1, 2003, DiGregorio filed an amended complaint\n\nin federal district court under ERISA § 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1132(a)(1)(B), which empowers a plan participant or beneficiary\n\n                                   -10-\n\fto bring a civil action \"to recover benefits due to [her] under the\n\nterms of [her] plan, to enforce [her] rights under the terms of the\n\nplan, or to clarify [her] rights to future benefits under the terms\n\nof the plan.\"      In her complaint, DiGregorio alleged that she\n\nqualified for LTD benefits under the Plan's definition of Total\n\nDisability, and that Hartford had erred in upholding its decision\n\nto terminate her benefits.      DiGregorio also alleged that Hartford\n\nhad not \"afford[ed] [her] a reasonable opportunity . . . for a full\n\nand fair review\" of her claim, as required by ERISA § 503(2), 29\n\nU.S.C.   §   1133(2),   and   its   implementing   regulations,   because\n\nHartford had failed to provide her with a copy of her entire claim\n\nfile upon request.      DiGregorio sought relief in the form of a\n\ndeclaratory judgment of entitlement to LTD benefits under the Plan;\n\nretroactive and prospective reinstatement of benefits; attorney's\n\nfees and costs; and \"such further, necessary, or proper relief as\n\n[the court] deems just and equitable in the circumstances.\"\n\n             Having obtained a copy of her entire claim file during\n\nlitigation, DiGregorio moved for judgment on the administrative\n\nrecord on June 11, 2004.      DiGregorio did not seek to introduce any\n\nevidence outside of the administrative record for consideration by\n\nthe district court.     As an alternate prayer for relief, however,\n\nDiGregorio sought a remand of her benefits claim to Hartford for an\n\nopportunity to supplement the administrative record.       Hartford and\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthe Plan cross-moved for summary judgment on June 21, 2004.2\n\nDuring a hearing on August 4, 2004, the parties agreed to the\n\ncourt's suggestion that it treat their cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment as \"a case stated or trial on the record itself,\" thereby\n\npermitting the court to make findings of fact instead of granting\n\ninferences to each non-movant in turn.\n\n            The district court awarded judgment to Hartford and the\n\nPlan on DiGregorio's claim of entitlement to benefits on August 9,\n\n2004.    In a written Memorandum and Order, the court reviewed de\n\nnovo Hartford's decision to uphold its termination of DiGregorio's\n\nbenefits.     DiGregorio, 2004 U.S. Dist LEXIS 15485, at *41.           It\n\nheld that \"given DiGregorio's underlying failure to adduce any\n\naffirmative    evidence   supporting    her   contention   that   she   was\n\ndisabled as to any occupation, the opinions of Dr. Howard and Dr.\n\nJupiter are fatal to [her] claim.        Accordingly, I conclude that\n\nHartford[] correctly determined that DiGregorio was not entitled to\n\ncontinued LTD benefits.\"     Id. at *60-61.     The court did not reach\n\nthe question of whether DiGregorio was otherwise unentitled to\n\nbenefits because she did not meet \"the Plan's requirement that she\n\nbe under the 'regular care' of a physician.\"        Id. at *61 n.25.\n\n            In a brief discussion at the end of its lengthy opinion,\n\nthe court separately addressed DiGregorio's argument that Hartford\n\n\n\n     2\n      Neither Hartford nor the Plan sought a remand on the ground\nthat DiGregorio had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.\n\n                                 -12-\n\fand the Plan had deprived her of a reasonable opportunity for a\n\nfull and fair review of her claim in violation of ERISA § 503(2) by\n\nfailing to provide her with a copy of her entire claim file upon\n\nrequest.   \"Even assuming that DiGregorio is correct that she was\n\nentitled to her complete file under [ERISA] § 503,\" the court\n\nstated, \"she must additionally demonstrate that she was somehow\n\nprejudiced by Hartford's failure to provide the file,\" which\n\nDiGregorio had obtained during the litigation.      Id. at *62.   The\n\ncourt noted that DiGregorio \"contends that\" if she had received a\n\ncopy of her entire claim file, \"she would have provided evidence\n\nthat she was under the regular care of a physician, evidence that\n\nshe suffered from pain and other psychological deficits associated\n\nwith her condition, and some further vocational expertise as to\n\navailable jobs.\"   Id. at *63, n.27.    The court concluded, however,\n\nthat DiGregorio's argument that \"she would have supplemented [the\n\nadministrative record] with further evidence to support her claim\"\n\nif she had been able to review her entire claim file was\n\n           post hoc rationalization. If DiGregorio had\n           additional information that could have altered\n           Hartford's decision, there was no reason she\n           could not have submitted it along with the\n           evidence she submitted during the appeals\n           process. . . . I note she has not alluded to\n           any evidence that she had or has additional\n           information that would have changed Hartford's\n           decision to deny her claim. Thus, I conclude\n           that she was not denied a full and fair review\n           of her claim.\n\nId. at *63 (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f           DiGregorio timely appealed.\n\n                                   II.\n\nA.         Scope and Standard of Review\n\n           DiGregorio raises a narrow issue on appeal. She does not\n\nchallenge the factual findings and legal conclusions set forth in\n\nthe district court's nearly fifty-page opinion relating to the\n\nmerits of her claim of entitlement to benefits based on the\n\nexisting administrative record, reached upon de novo review of\n\nHartford's final decision.      Nor does DiGregorio seek review of any\n\ndecision by the court relating to the admission of extra-record\n\nevidence, having made no attempt to introduce any such evidence\n\nbefore the district court.      DiGregorio argues only that the court,\n\ninstead of granting judgment in favor of Hartford and the Plan,\n\nshould have remanded her claim to Hartford for supplementation of\n\nthe record because Hartford failed to provide her with a copy of\n\nher entire claim file during its internal review process.\n\n           The scope of our review therefore is limited to the\n\nquestions of whether the district court properly conditioned remand\n\non a showing of prejudice and, if so, whether the district court\n\ncorrectly determined that DiGregorio had not made the requisite\n\nshowing.   Whether a remand based on Hartford's failure to disclose\n\nthe   complete   claim   file   upon   request   requires   a   showing   of\n\nprejudice is a legal question that we review de novo.

The\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fcourt's determination that DiGregorio did not show prejudice, by\n\ncontrast, is a factual conclusion that we review only for clear\n\nerror.

Reg. 27426,\n\n27426-27 (May 27, 1977).4\n\n\n      3\n      On appeal, DiGregorio does not challenge the defendants'\ncompliance with the notice requirements of ERISA § 503(1), 29\nU.S.C. § 1133(1), and its implementing regulations.\n      4\n      In 2000, the Department of Labor amended 29 C.F.R.\n§ 2560.503-1 to require that a plan's claim denial and review\nprocedures must, among other things, \"[p]rovide that a claimant\nshall be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable\naccess to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other\ninformation relevant to the claimant's claim for benefits,\" 29\nC.F.R. § 2560.503-1(h)(2)(iii) (2000) (emphasis added). Among the\nmaterials defined as \"relevant\" by 29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(m)(8)\n(2000) are those \"relied upon in making the benefit determination,\"\nas well as those \"submitted, considered, or generated in the course\nof making the benefit determination, without regard to whether\n[they were] relied upon in making the benefit determination.\"\n(Emphasis added).\n     The parties agree that DiGregorio's claim is not governed by\nthe regulation as amended in 2000 but by the original version\nadopted in 1977. DiGregorio filed her claim for benefits under the\nPlan before the amended regulation took effect on January 1, 2002.\n\n                                     -16-\n\f             \"The opportunity to review . . . pertinent documents is\n\ncritical to a full and fair review, for by that mechanism the\n\nclaimant has access to the evidence upon which the decision-maker\n\nrelied in denying the claim and thus the opportunity to challenge\n\nits accuracy and reliability.\"            Ellis v. Metropolitan Life Ins.\n\nCo.,   126   F.3d   228,   237   (4th    Cir.   1997).   As   one   court   has\n\nelaborated, because judicial review of claim denials is ordinarily\n\nlimited to the administrative record,\n\n             [t]he Plan's internal review process may be\n             the claimant's last genuine opportunity to\n             influence the final decision, to supplement\n             the record in preparation for judicial review,\n             or to correct any errors in the existing\n             record.    Meaningful participation in this\n             internal review process therefore requires\n             that the claimant have an opportunity to\n\n\nSee 29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(o). DiGregorio argues, however, that\nthe pre-amendment regulation requires plans to provide the same\nmaterials as those specified in the amended regulation because the\nDepartment of Labor has consistently interpreted the 1977 version\nof the regulation as contemplating that \"claimants must be provided\naccess to all of the information present in the claims record,\nwhether or not that information was relied upon by the plan in\ndenying the claim and whether or not that information was favorable\nto the claimant.\" 65 Fed. Reg. at 7024b, 70252 (Nov. 21, 2000).\nDiGregorio also points out that Hartford acknowledged in its denial\nletter of April 18, 2001 that it had \"considered [her] claim file\nas a whole\" in deciding to terminate DiGregorio's LTD benefits.\n     Because we assume, without deciding, that Hartford was\nobligated to provide DiGregorio with her entire claim file, we need\nnot determine the effect of the 2000 amendment on the Plan's\nobligations under ERISA § 503 and Hartford's duties as Plan\nadministrator. Nor do we need to address Hartford's arguments that\n(1) a plan administrator commits no procedural violation so long as\nit substantially complies with the procedural requirements imposed\non ERISA plans by regulation and (2) its provision of two documents\nfrom DiGregorio's claim file, the Employability Analysis Report and\nDr. Howard's Evaluation, constitutes substantial compliance.\n\n                                        -17-\n\f           review the relevant documents in the claim\n           file so the claimant may submit any additional\n           documents, correct any errors in the record,\n           point to any favorable evidence that would\n           tend to support the claim, fully understand\n           the reasons for the decision that is being\n           appealed, and to otherwise prepare an informed\n           response to that decision.\n\nPalmer v. Univ. Med. Group, 994 F. Supp. 1221, 1240 (D. Or. 1998).\n\n           DiGregorio maintains that Hartford's failure to disclose\n\nher complete claim file upon request deprived her of an opportunity\n\nfor full and fair review as required by ERISA § 503(2).     Following\n\nthe district court's approach, we will assume for the purposes of\n\nour decision that DiGregorio was entitled to see her entire claim\n\nfile.   See DiGregorio, 2004 U.S. Dist LEXIS 15485, at *62.\n\nC.         Prejudice\n\n           Although the district court assumed that \"DiGregorio\n\n. . . was entitled to her complete file under [ERISA] § 503,\" it\n\nultimately concluded that she \"was not denied a full and fair\n\nreview of her claim\" because she failed to \"demonstrate that she\n\nwas somehow prejudiced by Hartford's failure to provide the file.\"\n\nDiGregorio, 2004 U.S. Dist LEXIS 15485, at *62 (footnote and\n\ncitation omitted).     On appeal, DiGregorio disputes the conclusion\n\nthat a showing of prejudice is required to demonstrate a violation\n\nof ERISA's \"full and fair review\" requirement.      She also argues\n\nthat, in any event, she was prejudiced by Hartford's failure to\n\ndisclose the complete claim file upon request.\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f            1.       Propriety of Prejudice Requirement\n\n            In Terry v. Bayer Corp., 145 F.3d 28, 39 (1st Cir. 1998),\n\nthe case relied upon by the district court for its prejudice\n\nrequirement, we upheld a district court's denial of a plaintiff's\n\nclaim of entitlement to benefits in part because the claimant\n\nfailed to \"present[] any evidence that implies that a different\n\noutcome would have resulted\" if the plan administrator's notice of\n\ndenial of his claim had \"been in formal compliance with the\n\nregulations\" requiring plans to specify the procedures perfecting\n\na claim and for obtaining review of an adverse decision.\n\n            Terry,     in   turn,   relied    on   our   earlier decision in\n\nRecupero v. New Eng. Tel. & Tel. Co., 118 F.3d 820, 825 (1st Cir.\n\n1997), in which we affirmed the district court's denial of a\n\nplaintiff's similar claim of entitlement to benefits despite the\n\ncourt's conclusion that the defendant's \"denial letters . . . were\n\ninsufficient as a matter of law\" given ERISA's statutory and\n\nregulatory requirements for the provision by plan administrators of\n\nnotice of the procedures for obtaining review of the denial of a\n\nclaim.     In Recupero, we held that the district court properly\n\ndenied the plaintiff relief \"for [defendant's] failure to conform\"\n\nto the procedural requirements of ERISA § 503 where \"[t]he district\n\ncourt     determined    that   Recupero      had   not   proffered   evidence\n\nsufficient to support a finding of prejudice in any relevant\n\nsense.\"    Id. at 840; cf. Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 404\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fF.3d 510, 520 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting that it may be appropriate\n\nfor the court to consider \"evidence outside the administrative\n\nrecord\"   in   assessing      a      claim   of   \"prejudicial   procedural\n\nirregularity   in     the    ERISA    administrative    review   procedure\"\n\n(emphasis added)).\n\n          DiGregorio attempts to distinguish her case from these\n\nprecedents solely on the ground that the procedural irregularity in\n\nTerry and Recupero involved a plan administrator's failure to\n\nprovide the requisite notice of the steps required to perfect a\n\nclaim for benefits or seek review of the denial of a claim, while\n\nher case involves Hartford's more egregious failure to provide\n\ndocuments for DiGregorio's review in preparation of her appeal\n\nletter.\n\n          We   find    the   distinction     unpersuasive   in   this   case.\n\nNothing in either Terry or Recupero explicitly limits the prejudice\n\nrequirement to claims of defective notice under ERISA § 503(1), as\n\nopposed to claims of failure to disclose a complete claim file\n\nunder § 503(2).     Nor does the fact that the appellants in Terry and\n\nRecupero sought a grant of benefits on appeal, rather than the more\n\nlimited request for a remand to supplement the administrative\n\nrecord, create a meaningful distinction between the cases for\n\npurposes of the prejudice requirement.            DiGregorio is essentially\n\nseeking a second chance, based on Hartford's failure to disclose\n\nher complete claim file the first time around, to show that she is\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fentitled to benefits.        Under these circumstances, as a basis for a\n\nremand,    the   district     court      correctly       required    DiGregorio      to\n\ndemonstrate a connection between Hartford's failure to disclose the\n\ncomplete    file      and   her   inability         to   receive    from    the    plan\n\nadministrator a full and fair review of her claim to benefits.\n\n            2.         Application of Prejudice Requirement\n\n            To   be    entitled    to    a    remand,     DiGregorio       must    \"show\n\nprejudice in a relevant sense.\"               Recupero, 118 F.3d at 840.             In\n\nother words, she must show that as a result of Hartford's failure\n\nto disclose her complete claim file, she did not understand the\n\nevidence that she had to provide to dispute Hartford's conclusion\n\nthat she was not entitled to benefits.\n\n            DiGregorio contends that if she had been able to review\n\nher entire claim file while she was preparing her appeal letter,\n\nshe \"would have provided evidence that she was under the regular\n\ncare of a physician, evidence that she suffered from pain and other\n\npsychological deficits associated with her condition, and some\n\nfurther vocational expertise as to available jobs.\"                        Id. at *63\n\nn.27.      The     court    dismissed        this    contention     as     \"post     hoc\n\nrationalization,\"       noting    that    \"[i]f      DiGregorio     had    additional\n\ninformation that could have altered Hartford's decision, there was\n\n\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\fno reason she could not have submitted it along with the evidence\n\nshe submitted during the appeals process.\" Id.5\n\n           Under the terms of the Plan, DiGregorio had to show that\n\nher bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome rendered her unable to hold\n\n\"any occupation . . . for which [she was], or may be, qualified by\n\neducation, training or expertise.\"        The documents Hartford did\n\nprovide to DiGregorio in response to her initial request for\n\ndocuments clearly revealed Hartford's belief that DiGregorio could\n\nperform other occupations for which she was or could be qualified\n\ndespite her bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.            In her appeal\n\nletter, DiGregorio challenged the assumptions upon which Hartford's\n\nEmployability Analysis Report was based, as well as the accuracy of\n\nDr. Howard's recommendation. DiGregorio also submitted the opinion\n\nof a different physician, Dr. Jupiter.      Yet Dr. Jupiter's opinion\n\nmerely   confirmed   that   DiGregorio   could   not   perform   her   own\n\noccupation as a secretary, and that DiGregorio \"feels that she is\n\nunable to perform bimanual tasks in any form of work.\"       DiGregorio\n\ndoes not challenge the district court's determination that the\n\n\n\n     5\n      In her motion for judgment on the administrative record,\nDiGregorio argued that she suffered prejudice from Hartford's\nfailure to notify her in its denial letter that it did not consider\nher to be under the regular care of a physician. She argued that\nif she had been aware of this alternate ground for Hartford's\ndenial of her claim, she would have submitted proof that she was\nunder the regular care of a physician with her appeal letter to\nHartford.   The court upheld Hartford's decision to uphold its\ndenial of DiGregorio's claim on the alternate ground that she did\nnot meet the Plan's definition of Total Disability.\n\n                                 -22-\n\fmedical reports of both Dr. Howard and Dr. Jupiter, DiGregorio's\n\nown physicians, were \"fatal to [her] claim.\"             Id. at *60-61.\n\n           In short, DiGregorio has not shown \"prejudice in a\n\nrelevant   sense.\"      Recupero,     118    F.3d   at   840.   She    has   not\n\ndemonstrated that Hartford's failure to disclose her complete file\n\nupon request prevented her from submitting evidence necessary to\n\ndispute the denial of her claim for benefits.             Nor has DiGregorio\n\nshown that the refusal to disclose the complete claim file had any\n\nimpact on her \"[m]eaningful participation in [the] internal review\n\nprocess\" or otherwise impaired her ability to \"prepare an informed\n\nresponse to [Hartford's] decision.\"          Palmer, 994 F. Supp. at 1240.\n\nThe district court's conclusion that DiGregorio did not make the\n\nrequisite prejudice showing therefore was not clearly erroneous.\n\nAbsent   such   a    showing,   the    district     court   properly    denied\n\nDiGregorio's request for a remand to Hartford of her benefits claim\n\nfor supplementation of the record. Therefore, the district court's\n\njudgment is affirmed.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f",

In July 1995, DiGregorio applied for LTD benefits under the Coopers &amp; Lybrand Employee Long Term Disability and Income Plan, now the PricewaterhouseCoopers Long Term Disability Plan. In support of her claim, she submitted a statement by her attending physician, Dr. Walsh, diagnosing DiGregorio with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome that totally disabled her from performing her job as a secretary.

In August 1999, at Hartford's request, DiGregorio completed an \"Authorization to Obtain and Release Information\" permitting Hartford to periodically obtain DiGregorio's updated medical information so that Hartford could verify her disability status and eligibility for benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 18, 2001, Hartford notified DiGregorio by letter that \"the evidence submitted in support of your claim does not establish that you meet the Plan definition of Total Disability on or after April 16, 2001.\" Hartford stated that it had based its \"decision to deny your claim for benefits upon Plan language and all documents contained in your claim file, viewed as a whole.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartford then identified four specific pieces of information that it had considered: (1) \"Medical records received from [an orthopedic surgeon,] Douglas Howard, M.D.[,] regarding your April 11, 2000 evaluation,\" (2) \"Employability Analysis Report completed ... on March 22, 2001,\" (3) \"Telephone conversation with you on November 28, 2000,\" and (4) \"Telephone conversation with you on February 5, 2001.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Hartford explained:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The medical record completed by Dr. Howard on April 11, 2000 indicates that you are capable of working full time in an occupation that does not require repetitive use of your hands.

These positions are both sedentary and do not require repetitive use of the hands.\" The positions were: \"Customer-Complaint Clerk,\" \"Insurance Clerk,\" \"Information Clerk,\" and \"Counter Clerk.\" Hartford determined that because DiGregorio could perform duties pertaining to these occupations, \"for which [she was], or may be, qualified by education, training or expertise,\" she did not meet the Plan definition of Total Disability and was not entitled to LTD benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartford then reiterated: \"In reviewing your claim, [Hartford] considered your claim file as a whole for purposes of determining your eligibility [for] benefits under the Policy.\" Hartford concluded the denial letter by describing DiGregorio's rights \"to appeal our decision and review pertinent documents in your claim file,\" as well as to submit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">additional information not previously submitted which you believe will assist us in evaluating your claim for Long Term Disability benefits, ....

We believe Ms. DiGregorio is deprived [of] a full and fair review of her claim absent the provision of these materials.\" Hartford's reply by letter dated October 30, 2001 stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Ms. DiGregorio's entire claim file has certainly been reviewed, the documents that pertain to the denial of her claim are . . . the Employability Analysis Report of 03/22/01 and the 04/11/01 evaluation by Dr. Douglas Howard. The most recent medical documentation we have on file indicates that Ms. DiGregorio is not Totally Disabled from any occupation, and, therefore, that is information used in making our determination to deny benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. DiGregorio's Appeal to Hartford</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her appeal letter to Hartford through counsel on November 8, 2001, DiGregorio presented her arguments in support of her claim to benefits, including her challenges to the accuracy and reliability of Dr. Howard's recommendation and the results of the Employability Analysis Report. DiGregorio also provided additional materials for Hartford's review, including: (1) a laboratory report from Massachusetts General Hospital showing the results of an Electromyography (\"EMG\") test conducted on DiGregorio on November 29, 2000, (2) a February 6, 2001 letter to DiGregorio from Dr. Jupiter, (3) a July 31, 2001 treatment note made by Dr. Jupiter, and (4) an October 12, 2001 letter to DiGregorio's attorney from Dr. Jupiter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Jupiter's letter to DiGregorio of February 6, 2001 stated that \"electrical evaluation of your hand and wrist . . . shows substantial and serious compression of the median nerves in the carpal tunnel.... I believe that the problem can affect your ability to function and that you have at least for the present an ongoing disability as a result of this.\" His treatment note of July 31, 2001 stated that \"an EMG and nerve conduction study . . . afforded a compressive neuropathy in the median nerve. This interferes with [DiGregorio's] ability to function. She remains disabled because of this and will do so on a continued basis unless intervention proves successful.... Her prognosis is guarded.\" Dr. Jupiter's letter to DiGregorio's attorney of October 12, 2001 stated: \"An EMG and nerve conduction study confirm[] that [DiGregorio] still has dysfunction of her nerve. On the basis of this and her symptoms she continues to be disabled in her secretarial line of work and feels that she is unable to perform bimanual tasks in any form of work.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although DiGregorio did not request copies of any documents considered during Hartford's review of her appeal in her November 8, 2001 letter, she reiterated her position that Hartford's failure \"to provide her entire claim file in response to her request for copies of documents `pertinent' to the denial of her claim eviscerates her right to a full and fair review of this claim under ERISA.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartford upheld its termination of DiGregorio's claim for LTD benefits by letter on December 12, 2001, based on its consideration of \"Plan language and all documents contained in [DiGregorio's] claim file,\" including the additional information DiGregorio had submitted with her appeal letter. Hartford first noted that DiGregorio did not appear to be under the regular care of a physician, as required by the Plan. Hartford then addressed DiGregorio's disability status, explaining that \"[t]he testing and other medical documentation supplied does support an inability to use her hands in a repetitive manner. However, there is no medical documentation to support her inability to perform an occupation that does not require repetitive hand motion,\" such as any of the four \"Clerk\" occupations identified in the March 22, 2001 Employability Analysis Report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartford also indicated that it had reviewed an additional document not submitted by DiGregorio, namely, a \"Report from Dr. Jesse Jupiter, received in our office 12/06/01.\" Hartford explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to further clarify Ms. Di[Gre]gorio's functional capacity, [a registered nurse employed by Hartford] sent a letter to Dr. Jupiter with specific questions related to her disability and functional ability. When asked if he agreed with the restrictions identified by Dr. Howard of 04/11/00, Dr. Jupiter responded affirmatively. If you recall, Dr. Howard stated that Ms. Di[G]regorio is capable of full-time work in an occupation that does not require repetitive use of her hands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Proceedings in District Court</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 1, 2003, DiGregorio filed an amended complaint in federal district court under ERISA &#167; 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B), which empowers a plan participant or beneficiary to bring a civil action \"to recover benefits due to [her] under the terms of [her] plan, to enforce [her] rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify [her] rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\" In her complaint, DiGregorio alleged that she qualified for LTD benefits under the Plan's definition of Total Disability, and that Hartford had erred in upholding its decision to terminate her benefits. DiGregorio also alleged that Hartford had not \"afford[ed][her] a reasonable opportunity ... for a full and fair review\" of her claim, as required by ERISA &#167; 503(2), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1133(2), and its implementing regulations, because Hartford had failed to provide her with a copy of her entire claim file upon request. DiGregorio sought relief in the form of a declaratory judgment of entitlement to LTD benefits under the Plan; retroactive and prospective reinstatement of benefits; attorney's fees and costs; and \"such further, necessary, or proper relief as [the court] deems just and equitable in the circumstances.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having obtained a copy of her entire claim file during litigation, DiGregorio moved for judgment on the administrative record on June 11, 2004. DiGregorio did not seek to introduce any evidence outside of the administrative record for consideration by the district court. As an alternate prayer for relief, however, DiGregorio sought a remand of her benefits claim to Hartford for an opportunity to supplement the administrative record. Hartford and the Plan cross-moved for summary judgment on June 21, 2004.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> During a hearing on August 4, 2004, the parties agreed to the court's suggestion that it treat their cross-motions for summary judgment as \"a case stated or trial on the record itself,\" thereby permitting the court to make findings of fact instead of granting inferences to each non-movant in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court awarded judgment to Hartford and the Plan on DiGregorio's claim of entitlement to benefits on August 9, 2004. In a written Memorandum and Order, the court reviewed <i>de novo</i> Hartford's decision to uphold its termination of DiGregorio's benefits. <i>DiGregorio,</i> 2004 WL 1774566 at *19, 2004 U.S. Dist LEXIS 15485, at *41. It held that \"given DiGregorio's underlying failure to adduce any affirmative evidence supporting her contention that she was disabled as to any occupation, the opinions of Dr. Howard and Dr. Jupiter are fatal to [her] claim. Accordingly, I conclude that Hartford[] correctly determined that DiGregorio was not entitled to continued LTD benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> 2004 WL 1774566 at *19, 2004 U.S. Dist LEXIS 15485 at *60-61. The court did not reach the question of whether DiGregorio was otherwise unentitled to benefits because she did not meet \"the Plan's requirement that she be under the `regular care' of a physician.\" <i>Id.</i> 2004 WL 1774566 at *19 n. 25, 2004 U.S. Dist LEXIS 15485, at *61 n. 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a brief discussion at the end of its lengthy opinion, the court separately addressed DiGregorio's argument that Hartford and the Plan had deprived her of a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of her claim in violation of ERISA &#167; 503(2) by failing to provide her with a copy of her entire claim file upon request. \"Even assuming that DiGregorio is correct that she was entitled to her complete file under [ERISA] &#167; 503,\" the court stated, \"she must additionally demonstrate that she was somehow prejudiced by Hartford's failure to provide the file,\" which DiGregorio had obtained during the litigation. <i>Id.</i> 2004 WL 1774566 at *20, 2004 U.S. Dist LEXIS 15485 at *62. The court noted that DiGregorio \"contends that\" if she had received a copy of her entire claim file, \"she would have provided evidence that she was under the regular care of a physician, evidence that she suffered from pain and other psychological deficits associated with her condition, and some further vocational expertise as to available jobs.\" <i>Id.</i> 2004 WL 1774566 at *20, n. 27, 2004 U.S. Dist LEXIS 15485 at *63, n. 27. The court concluded, however, that DiGregorio's argument that \"she would have supplemented [the administrative record] with further evidence to support her claim\" if she had been able to review her entire claim file was</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">post hoc rationalization. If DiGregorio had additional information that could have altered Hartford's decision, there was no reason she could not have submitted it along with the evidence she submitted during the appeals process.... I note she has not alluded to any evidence that she had or has additional information that would have changed Hartford's decision to deny her claim. Thus, I conclude that she was not denied a full and fair review of her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> 2004 WL 1774566 at *20, 2004 U.S. Dist LEXIS 15485 at *63 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DiGregorio timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Scope and Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DiGregorio raises a narrow issue on appeal. She does not challenge the factual findings and legal conclusions set forth in the district court's nearly fifty-page opinion relating to the merits of her claim of entitlement to benefits based on the existing administrative record, reached upon <i>de novo</i> review of Hartford's final decision. Nor does DiGregorio seek review of any decision by the court relating to the admission of extra-record evidence, having made no attempt to introduce any such evidence before the district court. DiGregorio argues only that the court, instead of granting judgment in favor of Hartford and the Plan, should have remanded her claim to Hartford for supplementation of the record because Hartford failed to provide her with a copy of her entire claim file during its internal review process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scope of our review therefore is limited to the questions of whether the district court properly conditioned remand on a showing of prejudice and, if so, whether the district court correctly determined that DiGregorio had not made the requisite showing. Whether a remand based on Hartford's failure to disclose the complete claim file upon request requires a showing of prejudice is a legal question that we review <i>de novo. Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co.,</i> 126 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1997).

In the Preamble to the regulation, the Department of Labor expressed its view that \"[a]s part of the review the participant must be allowed to see all plan documents and other papers which affect the claim,\" and that \"plan procedures for review of claim denials must include the right of a claimant to ... review pertinent documents relating to the denial.\" 42 Fed.Reg. 27426, 27426-27 (May 27, 1977).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The opportunity to review ... pertinent documents is critical to a full and fair review, for by that mechanism the claimant has access to the evidence upon which the decision-maker relied in denying the claim and thus the opportunity to challenge its accuracy and reliability.\" <i>Ellis v.

Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,</i> 404 F.3d 510, 520 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that it may be appropriate for the court to consider \"evidence outside the administrative record\" in assessing a claim of \"<i>prejudicial</i> procedural irregularity in the ERISA administrative review procedure\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DiGregorio attempts to distinguish her case from these precedents solely on the ground that the procedural irregularity in <i>Terry</i> and <i>Recupero</i> involved a plan administrator's failure to provide the requisite notice of the steps required to perfect a claim for benefits or seek review of the denial of a claim, while her case involves Hartford's more egregious failure to provide documents for DiGregorio's review in preparation of her appeal letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the distinction unpersuasive in this case. Nothing in either <i>Terry</i> or <i>Recupero</i> explicitly limits the prejudice requirement to claims of defective notice under ERISA &#167; 503(1), as opposed to claims of failure to disclose a complete claim file under &#167; 503(2). Nor does the fact that the appellants in <i>Terry</i> and <i>Recupero</i> sought a grant of benefits on appeal, rather than the more limited request for a remand to supplement the administrative record, create a meaningful distinction between the cases for purposes of the prejudice requirement. DiGregorio is essentially seeking a second chance, based on Hartford's failure to disclose her complete claim file the first time around, to show that she is entitled to benefits. Under these circumstances, as a basis for a remand, the district court correctly required DiGregorio to demonstrate a connection between Hartford's failure to disclose the complete file and her inability to receive from the plan administrator a full and fair review of her claim to benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Application of Prejudice Requirement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be entitled to a remand, DiGregorio must \"show prejudice in a relevant sense.\" <i>Recupero,</i> 118 F.3d at 840. In other words, she must show that as a result of Hartford's failure to disclose her complete claim file, she did not understand the evidence that she had to provide to dispute Hartford's conclusion that she was not entitled to benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DiGregorio contends that if she had been able to review her entire claim file while she was preparing her appeal letter, she \"would have provided evidence that she was under the regular care of a physician, evidence that she suffered from pain and other psychological deficits associated with her condition, and some further vocational expertise as to available jobs.\" <i>Id.</i> 2004 WL 1774566 at *20 n. 27, 2004 U.S. Dist LEXIS 15485 at *63 n. 27. The court dismissed this contention as \"post hoc rationalization,\" noting that \"[i]f DiGregorio had additional information that could have altered Hartford's decision, there was no reason she could not have submitted it along with the evidence she submitted during the appeals process.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the terms of the Plan, DiGregorio had to show that her bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome rendered her unable to hold \"any occupation ... for which [she was], or may be, qualified by education, training or expertise.\" The documents Hartford did provide to DiGregorio in response to her initial request for documents clearly revealed Hartford's belief that DiGregorio could perform other occupations for which she was or could be qualified despite her bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. In her appeal letter, DiGregorio challenged the assumptions upon which Hartford's Employability Analysis Report was based, as well as the accuracy of Dr. Howard's recommendation. DiGregorio also submitted the opinion of a different physician, Dr. Jupiter. Yet Dr. Jupiter's opinion merely confirmed that DiGregorio could not perform her own occupation as a secretary, and that DiGregorio \"feels that she is unable to perform bimanual tasks in any form of work.\" DiGregorio does not challenge the district court's determination that the medical reports of both Dr. Howard and Dr. Jupiter, DiGregorio's own physicians, were \"fatal to [her] claim.\" <i>Id.</i> 2004 WL 1774566 at *19, 2004 U.S. Dist LEXIS 15485 at *60-61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, DiGregorio has not shown \"prejudice in a relevant sense.\" <i>Recupero,</i> 118 F.3d at 840. She has not demonstrated that Hartford's failure to disclose her complete file upon request prevented her from submitting evidence necessary to dispute the denial of her claim for benefits. Nor has DiGregorio shown that the refusal to disclose the complete claim file had any impact on her \"[m]eaningful participation in [the] internal review process\" or otherwise impaired her ability to \"prepare an informed response to [Hartford's] decision.\" <i>Palmer,</i> 994 F.Supp. at 1240. The district court's conclusion that DiGregorio did not make the requisite prejudice showing therefore was not clearly erroneous. Absent such a showing, the district court properly denied DiGregorio's request for a remand to Hartford of her benefits claim for supplementation of the record. Therefore, the district court's judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Hartford and the Plan filed a notice of cross-appeal but acknowledge in their answering brief that they do not challenge any of the district court's factual findings or legal conclusions, and that they seek affirmance of the district court's judgment. We therefore deem all arguments on the cross-appeal to be forfeited and dismiss the cross-appeal, No. 04-2252. DiGregorio's February 23, 2005 motion to order the cross-appeal \"denied as waived\" is denied as moot<i>See</i> 1st Cir.

Among the materials defined as \"relevant\" by 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2560.503-1(m)(8) (2000) are those \"relied upon in making the benefit determination,\" as well as those \"submitted, considered, or generated in the course of making the benefit determination, <i>without regard to whether [they were] relied upon</i> in making the benefit determination.\" (Emphasis added).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that DiGregorio's claim is not governed by the regulation as amended in 2000 but by the original version adopted in 1977. DiGregorio filed her claim for benefits under the Plan before the amended regulation took effect on January 1, 2002. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2560.503-1(<i>o</i>). DiGregorio argues, however, that the pre-amendment regulation requires plans to provide the same materials as those specified in the amended regulation because the Department of Labor has consistently interpreted the 1977 version of the regulation as contemplating that \"claimants must be provided access to all of the information present in the claims record, whether or not that information was relied upon by the plan in denying the claim and whether or not that information was favorable to the claimant.\" 65 Fed.Reg. at 7024b, 70252 (Nov. 21, 2000). DiGregorio also points out that Hartford acknowledged in its denial letter of April 18, 2001 that it had \"considered [her] claim file as a whole\" in deciding to terminate DiGregorio's LTD benefits.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Because we assume, without deciding, that Hartford was obligated to provide DiGregorio with her entire claim file, we need not determine the effect of the 2000 amendment on the Plan's obligations under ERISA &#167; 503 and Hartford's duties as Plan administrator. Nor do we need to address Hartford's arguments that (1) a plan administrator commits no procedural violation so long as it substantially complies with the procedural requirements imposed on ERISA plans by regulation and (2) its provision of two documents from DiGregorio's claim file, the Employability Analysis Report and Dr. Howard's Evaluation, constitutes substantial compliance.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In her motion for judgment on the administrative record, DiGregorio argued that she suffered prejudice from Hartford's failure to notify her in its denial letter that it did not consider her to be under the regular care of a physician. She argued that if she had been aware of this alternate ground for Hartford's denial of her claim, she would have submitted proof that she was under the regular care of a physician with her appeal letter to Hartford. The court upheld Hartford's decision to uphold its denial of DiGregorio's claim on the alternate ground that she did not meet the Plan's definition of Total Disability</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

DiGregorio challenges only the district court's denial of her alternate prayer for relief requesting a remand to Hartford, the Plan administrator, for supplementation of the administrative record, on the ground that Hartford and the Plan failed to provide a reasonable opportunity for full and fair review of her benefits claim in violation of ERISA &#167; 503, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1133, and its implementing regulations.

DiGregorio's Claim for LTD Benefits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DiGregorio worked as a secretary for Coopers &amp; Lybrand (now PricewaterhouseCoopers) from September 1988 through early February 1995, when she began receiving worker's compensation. In July 1995, DiGregorio applied for LTD benefits under the Coopers &amp; Lybrand Employee Long Term Disability and Income Plan, now the PricewaterhouseCoopers Long Term Disability Plan. In support of her claim, she submitted a statement by her attending physician, Dr. Walsh, diagnosing DiGregorio with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome that totally disabled her from performing her job as a secretary. The Plan administrator, then the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company, approved DiGregorio's claim in September 1995, and DiGregorio began receiving LTD benefits for the period beginning August 1, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the terms of the Plan, DiGregorio was entitled to LTD benefits for \"Total Disability\" for a period of up to two years so long as she could \"perform no duty pertaining to [her] occupation\" as a secretary. DiGregorio was entitled to continue receiving benefits beyond the two-year period only so long as she could \"perform no duty pertaining not only to [her] occupation but to <i>any</i> occupation... for which [she] is, or may be, qualified by education, training or expertise\" (emphasis added). DiGregorio continued to receive LTD benefits beyond the initial two-year period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Hartford's Termination of DiGregorio's LTD Benefits</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1999, PricewaterhouseCoopers retained Hartford to administer claims for benefits under the Plan. In August 1999, at Hartford's request, DiGregorio completed an \"Authorization to Obtain and Release Information\" permitting Hartford to periodically obtain DiGregorio's updated medical information so that Hartford could verify her disability status and eligibility for benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 18, 2001, Hartford notified DiGregorio by letter that \"the evidence submitted in support of your claim does not establish that you meet the Plan definition of Total Disability on or after April 16, 2001.\" Hartford stated that it had based its \"decision to deny your claim for benefits upon Plan language and all documents contained in your claim file, viewed as a whole.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartford then identified four specific pieces of information that it had considered: (1) \"Medical records received from [an orthopedic surgeon,] Douglas Howard, M.D.[,] regarding your April 11, 2000 evaluation,\" (2) \"Employability Analysis Report completed ... on March 22, 2001,\" (3) \"Telephone conversation with you on November 28, 2000,\" and (4) \"Telephone conversation with you on February 5, 2001.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Hartford explained:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The medical record completed by Dr. Howard on April 11, 2000 indicates that you are capable of working full time in an occupation that does not require repetitive use of your hands. Dr. Howard states that he does not find you totally disabled but only partially disabled. He indicates that you would be capable of performing a sedentary job on a full time basis that did not require repetitive use of your hands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartford noted that although DiGregorio had indicated in the telephone conversations that she \"would have [a different physician,] Dr. Jupiter[,] send medical information [to Hartford] concerning [her] condition[,][t]o date, this information has not been received. We do not have sufficient medical documentation to verify continued disability.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Hartford stated: \"We have identified the following positions that you could perform based on your abilities as identified by Dr. Howard. These positions are both sedentary and do not require repetitive use of the hands.\" The positions were: \"Customer-Complaint Clerk,\" \"Insurance Clerk,\" \"Information Clerk,\" and \"Counter Clerk.\" Hartford determined that because DiGregorio could perform duties pertaining to these occupations, \"for which [she was], or may be, qualified by education, training or expertise,\" she did not meet the Plan definition of Total Disability and was not entitled to LTD benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartford then reiterated: \"In reviewing your claim, [Hartford] considered your claim file as a whole for purposes of determining your eligibility [for] benefits under the Policy.\" Hartford concluded the denial letter by describing DiGregorio's rights \"to appeal our decision and review pertinent documents in your claim file,\" as well as to submit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">additional information not previously submitted which you believe will assist us in evaluating your claim for Long Term Disability benefits, ....

According to the Evaluation, Dr. Howard made the following recommendation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this time I do not find [DiGregorio] totally disabled but only partially disabled.

By letter of October 8, 2001, Hartford responded that \"we cannot release any documents contained in Ms. Di[G]regorio's claim file that are not pertinent to the denial of her claim. The documents that accompanied our September 25, 2001 letter are those that were used in making our determination.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DiGregorio made a third request for her entire claim file through counsel by letter dated October 25, 2001, stating, \"it is our position that you must have, and indeed <i>should</i> have, considered Ms. DiGregorio's <i>entire</i> claim file in making a decision to terminate benefits on this claim.... We believe Ms. DiGregorio is deprived [of] a full and fair review of her claim absent the provision of these materials.\" Hartford's reply by letter dated October 30, 2001 stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Ms. DiGregorio's entire claim file has certainly been reviewed, the documents that pertain to the denial of her claim are . . . the Employability Analysis Report of 03/22/01 and the 04/11/01 evaluation by Dr. Douglas Howard. The most recent medical documentation we have on file indicates that Ms. DiGregorio is not Totally Disabled from any occupation, and, therefore, that is information used in making our determination to deny benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. DiGregorio's Appeal to Hartford</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her appeal letter to Hartford through counsel on November 8, 2001, DiGregorio presented her arguments in support of her claim to benefits, including her challenges to the accuracy and reliability of Dr. Howard's recommendation and the results of the Employability Analysis Report. DiGregorio also provided additional materials for Hartford's review, including: (1) a laboratory report from Massachusetts General Hospital showing the results of an Electromyography (\"EMG\") test conducted on DiGregorio on November 29, 2000, (2) a February 6, 2001 letter to DiGregorio from Dr. Jupiter, (3) a July 31, 2001 treatment note made by Dr. Jupiter, and (4) an October 12, 2001 letter to DiGregorio's attorney from Dr. Jupiter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Jupiter's letter to DiGregorio of February 6, 2001 stated that \"electrical evaluation of your hand and wrist . . . shows substantial and serious compression of the median nerves in the carpal tunnel.... I believe that the problem can affect your ability to function and that you have at least for the present an ongoing disability as a result of this.\" His treatment note of July 31, 2001 stated that \"an EMG and nerve conduction study . . . afforded a compressive neuropathy in the median nerve. This interferes with [DiGregorio's] ability to function. She remains disabled because of this and will do so on a continued basis unless intervention proves successful.... Her prognosis is guarded.\" Dr. Jupiter's letter to DiGregorio's attorney of October 12, 2001 stated: \"An EMG and nerve conduction study confirm[] that [DiGregorio] still has dysfunction of her nerve.

Hartford first noted that DiGregorio did not appear to be under the regular care of a physician, as required by the Plan. Hartford then addressed DiGregorio's disability status, explaining that \"[t]he testing and other medical documentation supplied does support an inability to use her hands in a repetitive manner. However, there is no medical documentation to support her inability to perform an occupation that does not require repetitive hand motion,\" such as any of the four \"Clerk\" occupations identified in the March 22, 2001 Employability Analysis Report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartford also indicated that it had reviewed an additional document not submitted by DiGregorio, namely, a \"Report from Dr. Jesse Jupiter, received in our office 12/06/01.\" Hartford explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to further clarify Ms. Di[Gre]gorio's functional capacity, [a registered nurse employed by Hartford] sent a letter to Dr. Jupiter with specific questions related to her disability and functional ability.

DiGregorio also alleged that Hartford had not \"afford[ed][her] a reasonable opportunity ... for a full and fair review\" of her claim, as required by ERISA &#167; 503(2), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1133(2), and its implementing regulations, because Hartford had failed to provide her with a copy of her entire claim file upon request. DiGregorio sought relief in the form of a declaratory judgment of entitlement to LTD benefits under the Plan; retroactive and prospective reinstatement of benefits; attorney's fees and costs; and \"such further, necessary, or proper relief as [the court] deems just and equitable in the circumstances.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having obtained a copy of her entire claim file during litigation, DiGregorio moved for judgment on the administrative record on June 11, 2004. DiGregorio did not seek to introduce any evidence outside of the administrative record for consideration by the district court. As an alternate prayer for relief, however, DiGregorio sought a remand of her benefits claim to Hartford for an opportunity to supplement the administrative record. Hartford and the Plan cross-moved for summary judgment on June 21, 2004.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> During a hearing on August 4, 2004, the parties agreed to the court's suggestion that it treat their cross-motions for summary judgment as \"a case stated or trial on the record itself,\" thereby permitting the court to make findings of fact instead of granting inferences to each non-movant in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court awarded judgment to Hartford and the Plan on DiGregorio's claim of entitlement to benefits on August 9, 2004.

She does not challenge the factual findings and legal conclusions set forth in the district court's nearly fifty-page opinion relating to the merits of her claim of entitlement to benefits based on the existing administrative record, reached upon <i>de novo</i> review of Hartford's final decision. Nor does DiGregorio seek review of any decision by the court relating to the admission of extra-record evidence, having made no attempt to introduce any such evidence before the district court. DiGregorio argues only that the court, instead of granting judgment in favor of Hartford and the Plan, should have remanded her claim to Hartford for supplementation of the record because Hartford failed to provide her with a copy of her entire claim file during its internal review process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scope of our review therefore is limited to the questions of whether the district court properly conditioned remand on a showing of prejudice and, if so, whether the district court correctly determined that DiGregorio had not made the requisite showing.

In <i>Recupero,</i> we held that the district court properly denied the plaintiff relief \"for [defendant's] failure to conform\" to the procedural requirements of ERISA &#167; 503 where \"[t]he district court determined that Recupero had not proffered evidence sufficient to support a finding of prejudice in any relevant sense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 840; <i>cf.

Nor does the fact that the appellants in <i>Terry</i> and <i>Recupero</i> sought a grant of benefits on appeal, rather than the more limited request for a remand to supplement the administrative record, create a meaningful distinction between the cases for purposes of the prejudice requirement. DiGregorio is essentially seeking a second chance, based on Hartford's failure to disclose her complete claim file the first time around, to show that she is entitled to benefits.

In her appeal letter, DiGregorio challenged the assumptions upon which Hartford's Employability Analysis Report was based, as well as the accuracy of Dr. Howard's recommendation. DiGregorio also submitted the opinion of a different physician, Dr. Jupiter. Yet Dr. Jupiter's opinion merely confirmed that DiGregorio could not perform her own occupation as a secretary, and that DiGregorio \"feels that she is unable to perform bimanual tasks in any form of work.\" DiGregorio does not challenge the district court's determination that the medical reports of both Dr. Howard and Dr. Jupiter, DiGregorio's own physicians, were \"fatal to [her] claim.\" <i>Id.</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1774566</span></span> at *19, 2004 U.S. Dist LEXIS 15485 at *60-61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, DiGregorio has not shown \"prejudice in a relevant sense.\" <i>Recupero,</i> 118 F.3d at 840.

The district court's conclusion that DiGregorio did not make the requisite prejudice showing therefore was not clearly erroneous.

DiGregorio filed her claim for benefits under the Plan before the amended regulation took effect on January 1, 2002. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2560.503-1(<i>o</i>). DiGregorio argues, however, that the pre-amendment regulation requires plans to provide the same materials as those specified in the amended regulation because the Department of Labor has consistently interpreted the 1977 version of the regulation as contemplating that \"claimants must be provided access to all of the information present in the claims record, whether or not that information was relied upon by the plan in denying the claim and whether or not that information was favorable to the claimant.\" 65 Fed.Reg. at 7024b, 70252 (Nov. 21, 2000). DiGregorio also points out that Hartford acknowledged in its denial letter of April 18, 2001 that it had \"considered [her] claim file as a whole\" in deciding to terminate DiGregorio's LTD benefits.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Because we assume, without deciding, that Hartford was obligated to provide DiGregorio with her entire claim file, we need not determine the effect of the 2000 amendment on the Plan's obligations under ERISA &#167; 503 and Hartford's duties as Plan administrator. Nor do we need to address Hartford's arguments that (1) a plan administrator commits no procedural violation so long as it substantially complies with the procedural requirements imposed on ERISA plans by regulation and (2) its provision of two documents from DiGregorio's claim file, the Employability Analysis Report and Dr. Howard's Evaluation, constitutes substantial compliance.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In her motion for judgment on the administrative record, DiGregorio argued that she suffered prejudice from Hartford's failure to notify her in its denial letter that it did not consider her to be under the regular care of a physician. She argued that if she had been aware of this alternate ground for Hartford's denial of her claim, she would have submitted proof that she was under the regular care of a physician with her appeal letter to Hartford. The court upheld Hartford's decision to uphold its denial of DiGregorio's claim on the alternate ground that she did not meet the Plan's definition of Total Disability</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
