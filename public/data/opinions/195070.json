This is an appeal by\n          BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.\n                                      \n\ndefendants-appellants, the  Mary Hitchcock  Memorial Hospital\n\nand the  Hitchcock Clinic, Inc., from a  jury verdict finding\n\nthem  liable to  plaintiffs-appellees,  Kimberly F.  and  her\n\nhusband, John F., because of negligent care given Kimberly F.\n\nwhile she  was  a  patient at  the  Mary  Hitchcock  Memorial\n\nHospital.   John F.'s suit was  for loss of  consortium.  We,\n\ntherefore,  treat the  plaintiffs  as  one.    The  Hitchcock\n\nClinic, Inc. is an incorporated association of physicians and\n\nsurgeons, some of  whom treated Kimberly F. while  she was at\n\nthe hospital.  Because of the nature of Kimberly F.'s injury,\n\nit was agreed  that she and her husband  could use pseudonyms\n\nto keep some degree of anonymity.\n\n          Kimberly F. was admitted to the obstetrical unit of\n\nthe hospital on August  2, 1986.  She gave birth  to a son on\n\nAugust 3.   The  child was full  term.   There were  no birth\n\ncomplications, and she was discharged  on August 5.  One week\n\nlater, on August  13, Kimberly F. was diagnosed  as having an\n\noutbreak  of genital  herpes.    She  subsequently  sued  the\n\ndefendants alleging that  she was infected with  herpes while\n\nat the  hospital and  that defendants  negligently failed  to\n\nprotect her  from such infection.   Plaintiff also  brought a\n\ncount  for failure  to  obtain informed  consent.1   The jury\n\n                    \n\n1.  Plaintiff and her husband had moved from New Hampshire to\nanother   state  before  this   action,  based  on  diversity\njurisdiction, was brought.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nfound defendants not liable on  this count and there has been\n\nno appeal from this finding.\n\n          Defendants  raise three issues before us:  that, as\n\na  matter of  law, there  was insufficient  evidence for  the\n\njury's finding of  negligence; that testimony  was improperly\n\nadmitted;  and  that  the  closing  argument  of  plaintiff's\n\ncounsel on pain  and suffering was improper.   We discuss the\n\nissues seriatim.\n\n                              I.\n\n                 SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n                                            \n\n          In ruling on an appeal  from the denial of a motion\n\nfor a  directed verdict, we  conduct a plenary review  of the\n\nevidence.   Our  review of  the evidence  and all  reasonable\n\ninferences  therefrom is made in the  light most favorable to\n\nthe non-moving party.   American Private Line  Services, Inc.\n                                                             \n\nv.

The  denial of a  motion for judgment\n\nn.o.v. is  also subject to  plenary review.  The  standard of\n\nreview  is whether the evidence and all reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom  could  lead   a  reasonable  person  to   but  one\n\nconclusion:  that the moving  party was entitled to judgment.\n\nPontarelli  v.

We have conducted the requisite review\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nand find that  the district court was correct  in denying the\n\nmotions for a directed verdict and judgment n.o.v.\n\nA.  The Evidence\n                \n\n          The  evidence viewed in the light most favorable to\n\nplaintiff  was as  follows.   When  she was  admitted to  the\n\nhospital on August 2, 1986, plaintiff had no prior history of\n\nherpes.  When plaintiff was examined by  defendants on August\n\n13,  she  was  diagnosed as  having  an  outbreak  of genital\n\nherpes.  Such an outbreak  is characterized by lesions in the\n\ninfected  area.  The incubation period for a herpes infection\n\nis two to twenty-six days.  Plaintiff entered the hospital on\n\nAugust  2,  was  discharged  on  August  5,  and  the medical\n\ndiagnosis  of genital herpes was made on  August 13.  She was\n\nwell within the herpes incubation period.\n\n          Genital herpes is a life-long affliction and, as is\n\ntrue of  other types of  herpes, is incurable.   Outbreaks of\n\nherpes, manifested by lesions and cold sores, occur from time\n\nto  time during  the  victim's  life.   The  first attack  is\n\nusually  the  most  severe.    The  genital  herpes  outbreak\n\ndiagnosed on August  13 was a primary  (first-ever) outbreak,\n\ni.e.,  plaintiff never  had a herpes  outbreak prior  to this\n    \n\ntime.   Plaintiff's sexual history  was as follows.   She had\n\nsexual  intercourse  twice  in high  school;  both  times her\n\npartners used  condoms.   She married for  the first  time in\n\n1981.  After her first child was born she was divorced.   The\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ndivorce became final in  1982 or 1983.   She met her  present\n\nhusband in 1984.   She had no sexual relations with other men\n\nbetween separating  from her  first husband  and meeting  her\n\npresent one.  Neither she nor her husband had ever engaged in\n\noral sex at any time.   Plaintiff's husband has never had any\n\nherpes symptoms.\n\n          When plaintiff  was first admitted to  the hospital\n\nshe was  put in a birthing  room that shared a  bathroom with\n\nanother  patient.   Plaintiff went  into  the bathroom  alone\n\nbecause  no one  had  come  in response  to  her pushing  the\n\nnurses' call button.  She felt dizzy and sat on the toilet to\n\navoid falling.  In  so doing, she sat on a  urine catch basin\n\nthat was in the  toilet bowl.  The basin contained urine from\n\nthe  other  patient.    As  her  labor  pains   increased  in\n\nfrequency, a nurse suggested a warm bath might help.  She was\n\ntaken  to a room  with a bathtub.   Both she  and her husband\n\nnoted that  the tub contained  some dead bugs.   There was an\n\nopen window with no screen.   Plaintiff's husband cleaned out\n\nthe tub and she took a bath.  During the birthing process, an\n\nepisiotomy  was done.   This  consists of  making a  surgical\n\nincision  into the  perineum  and  vagina  so as  to  prevent\n\ntearing  during delivery.  Prior to delivery, nurses examined\n\nplaintiff internally to  see whether her cervix  had dilated.\n\nSome of the  nurses did not wash  their hands in the  sink in\n\nplaintiff's room before examining her.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\n          After  delivery,  plaintiff  experienced  pain  and\n\ndiscomfort at the  site of the episiotomy.   Reusable plastic\n\nice packs were applied to ease her discomfort.  The ice packs\n\nwere wrapped in sterile green  surgical cloth.  At times, the\n\npack was placed  over plaintiff's vaginal area in  such a way\n\nthat the surgical  cloth did not completely cover the plastic\n\nbag.  This resulted in direct contact between the site of the\n\nepisiotomy and  the plastic bag.   On the day  of plaintiff's\n\ndischarge  a nurse came  in and checked  plaintiff's perineal\n\narea and  touched the  episiotomy site with  her hands.   The\n\nnurse had not washed her hands, nor was she wearing gloves.\n\n          On  July  31,   a  patient  was  admitted   to  the\n\nobstetrics unit of  the hospital with a  herpes lesion behind\n\nher right knee.   The patient was placed  on herpes isolation\n\nprecautions during all  of the time she was  at the hospital.\n\nThis  entailed  strict procedures  to  prevent  the patient's\n\nherpes  infection from  spreading to  other  patients.   This\n\npatient was discharged on the morning  of August 2; plaintiff\n\nwas admitted at 11:30 p.m. on August 2.\n\n          A second patient  with herpes was in  the maternity\n\nward at the  same time as plaintiff.   This patient, \"J.D.,\"2\n\noccupied the same room as  did plaintiff immediately prior to\n\nplaintiff being put in  the room.   The records of J.D.  show\n\n                    \n\n2.  This  is the  case name  of the  patient, not  her actual\nname.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\nthat because she had had monthly episodes of herpes outbreaks\n\nduring her  pregnancy, she  was admitted  \"at risk,\"  and was\n\nplaced on herpes infection precautions.  A herpes culture was\n\ntaken from  J.D.'s right labial  lesion on July  28.  It  was\n\nnoted in  her records that  she was  at high risk  and herpes\n\ninfection precautions were  continued.  J.D. gave birth via a\n\nCaesarean  section on  July 29.   Her  records show  that the\n\nreasons for  the Caesarean  section were  that  the baby  was\n\nbreached and that J.D. was at risk  with herpes.  On July 30,\n\na  nurse's note  in J.D.'s  records stated  that she  had two\n\nlesions on the left outer lower labia.   A subsequent note on\n\nthe same  day states that  J.D. continued to have  lesions on\n\nthe  left  lower labia.    There  is  nothing in  the  record\n\nindicating that any culture was taken from the lesions on her\n\nleft lower labia.  The only culture taken was from the lesion\n\non  the right  labia.   The lab  report on  this culture  was\n\nnecessarily a preliminary one; it was negative for herpes.  A\n\nnegative  culture  report  on  herpes  normally  includes the\n\nstatement, \"these  results  do  not  exclude  infection  with\n\nherpes simplex virus.\"  This report did not so state.  On the\n\nevening of August  2, the day that plaintiff  was admitted to\n\nthe  hospital,  J.D.  was transferred  to  the  second floor.\n\nLater that  evening she told  a nurse that she  was concerned\n\nabout  the  fact that  she  was  still  on  herpes  infection\n\nprecautions.  The nurse, Linda Morgan, recorded  in her chart\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nthat J.D. wanted to be taken off herpes infection precautions\n\nand  that  she had  shown no  lesions  since July  29.   This\n\ninformation was given  by telephone to  Dr. Ketterer and  the\n\nsame night, August 2,  he gave a verbal order  to remove J.D.\n\nfrom herpes precautions.  \n\n          Nurse Morgan admitted during her testimony that she\n\ndid not  tell Dr. Ketterer  about the lesions on  J.D.'s left\n\nlabial area.  Dr. Ketterer admitted that his decision to take\n\nJ.D. off herpes infection precautions was based on incomplete\n\ninformation.    About two  hours  after  J.D.  was taken  off\n\nprecautions, plaintiff  was admitted  to the  hospital.   She\n\nspent  the next  eight hours  in  labor and  delivery on  the\n\nsecond floor,  where J.D. was  also located.   Both plaintiff\n\nand J.D. were  discharged from the hospital on  the same day,\n\nAugust 5.\n\n          Two nurses, J.W. and M.W., had herpes and worked in\n\nthe maternity  ward of  the hospital  while  plaintiff was  a\n\npatient there.   J.W. had a  history of genital  herpes.  She\n\ngave direct patient care to plaintiff, which included placing\n\nice  packs  on  her perineum  and  physically  examining her.\n\nThere  was no  direct  evidence  that  the other  nurse  with\n\nherpes, M.W., had patient contact with plaintiff, but she was\n\npresent on the  maternity ward and available to  give care to\n\nall of the patients in the ward.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\n          All of the doctors who testified agreed, in effect,\n\nthat it would be a violation of acceptable hospital infection\n\nprecautions for  a patient to  be infected by herpes  while a\n\nhospital patient.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nB.  Testimony of Plaintiff's Expert Witness\n                                           \n\n          Appellants'  attack  on  the  sufficiency  of   the\n\nevidence  focuses  on  the  testimony  of plaintiff's  expert\n\nwitness,  Dr. James  Kahn.   Their claim  is that  \"no expert\n\nwitness identified any  act of negligence that  more probably\n\nthan  not caused  the infection.\"   Appellants'  Brief  at 9.\n\nBoth sides agree that New Hampshire law  controls this issue.\n\nWe   will  therefore  examine  New  Hampshire  law  and  rule\n\naccordingly.\n\n          In   Thorpe   v.   New  Hampshire   Department   of\n                                                             \n\nCorrections, 575 A.2d 351, 353 (N.H. 1990), the court stated:\n           \n\n\"The general rule  in medical malpractice  cases is that  the\n\nproximate cause between the negligence and the injury must be\n\nestablished  through   expert  testimony.\"    In   Martin  v.\n                                                         \n\nWentworth-Douglass Hospital,  536 A.2d 174, 176  (N.H. 1987),\n                           \n\nthe  court  held  that  expert  testimony  was  necessary  to\n\nestablish  the causal link  between the injury  complained of\n\nand the health care  provider sought to be  held accountable,\n\nand  \"[t]he quantum of  such evidence necessary  to survive a\n\nmotion for nonsuit had to be enough to warrant the conclusion\n\nof a reasonable juror that the causal link probably existed.\"\n\nSee  also Wilder  v. Eberhart,  977 F.2d  673, 676  (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1992).  In  Pillsbury-Flood v.

There was no\n\nobjection to Dr. Kahn's expert qualifications in the field of\n\ninfectious diseases.   The crux of his testimony  came in the\n\nanswers  to a  series  of  questions.   Dr.  Kahn was  asked:\n\n\"Based on your review of all the information, do you  have an\n\nopinion, based  on reasonable  medical  probabilities, as  to\n\nwhether  or not  Mrs. F.'s infection,  outbreak of  herpes in\n\nAugust of 1986 was a primary infection?\"  He answered:  \"Yes,\n\nI continue  to feel very  emphatically that it was  a primary\n\ninfection.\"   In prior testimony  Dr. Kahn had explained that\n\nthe  term  \"primary  infection\"  meant  a  first-ever  herpes\n\ninfection.   Dr.  Kahn  had explained  the  nature of  herpes\n\ninfections and how outbreaks of the disease are manifested.\n\n          The  next question bearing  on the issue  was:  \"Do\n\nyou   have   an   opinion,  based   on   reasonable   medical\n\nprobabilities, as  to whether  or  not the  hospital was  the\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nprobable  source  of  --  general  source  of  Kimberly  F.'s\n\ninfection in  August of  1986?\"  Dr.  Kahn answered  that the\n\ninfection  was  clearly   associated  with  the   plaintiff's\n\nhospitalization.   The  following  question was  then  asked:\n\n\"What  were the  possible means  of  transmission within  the\n\nhospital  that could have resulted  in her infection?\"  There\n\nwas an  objection based  on the use  of the  word \"possible;\"\n\nthat \"the plaintiffs' burden of proof is probabilities.\"  The\n\ncourt  denied the  objection,  pointing  out  that  the  main\n\nquestion  was premised  on reasonable  medical probabilities,\n\nand these were the factors  the expert considered in arriving\n\nat his  opinion.   Dr.  Kahn  was asked  again  to state  the\n\npossible  sources  of  plaintiff's infection.    He answered:\n\n\"The likeliest, I  think, is another patient who  at the time\n\nof your client's  hospitalization had what to all intents and\n\npurposes sounded like a recurrent genital herpes outbreak and\n\nin at  least one instance  shared a care  giver over  a short\n\nperiod  of time.\"   This answer  was followed by  a series of\n\nquestions and answers:\n\n          What is your understanding as to  whether\n          or  not there  was any  potential patient\n          source at the hospital?\n\n          A.   My  understanding  from reading  the\n          record is  that there  were two  patients\n          that I'm aware of who had what was either\n          diagnosed by  somebody else as  an active\n          herpes   infection  or   to  my   reading\n          certainly  compatible   with  an   active\n          herpes infection.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\n          Q.   Were  both  those patients  possible\n          sources?\n\n          A.   Yes, I  think they're both  possible\n          sources.\n\n          Q.    Would   you  consider  health  care\n          workers as possible sources?\n\n          A.   Yes,  they're possible  sources too,\n          yes.\n\n          In  his  prior  testimony Dr.  Kahn  had  discussed\n\ninanimate objects    called fomites    such as  toilet seats,\n\nflat  surfaces  and  ice  packs,  as  potential  transmission\n\nsources of herpes.   He was asked if he considered fomites as\n\na possible infection source.\n\n             I  did.  I considered them, but my own\n          judgment is that that's considerably less\n          likely.  I know there was one instance in\n          particular  -- I don't  know if it's been\n          raised before so I don't know if I should\n          mention  it -- well, I read it so I guess\n          I can  mention there was some  talk about\n          an ice pack applied to the perineum.\n\n             My sense  of that was that even though\n          the  ice pack could  have been wrapped in\n          gauze and therefore,  could have held the\n          virus in it, it was more consistent  with\n          what we  know about  herpes transmission,\n          that   it  was  the  hand  of  the  nurse\n          applying the ice pack rather than the ice\n          pack that  would have  been the  likelier\n          source of transmission.\n\n          Dr. Kahn was then asked:  \n\n             Having considered all of the potential\n          sources of  infection, did you  arrive at\n          one that was most likely in your mind?\n\n          His answer was:\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\n             I think  the likeliest  explanation is\n          the patient who had  vaginal lesions with\n          a  second  crop  on  the  left  labia,  I\n          believe,  and was  taken care  of  at one\n          point by  a  health care  giver who  very\n          shortly  thereafter  took   care  of  Kim\n          [plaintiff].\n\n          Dr. Kahn  identified the patient  as J.D.   He then\n\ntestified that,  in  light  of the  fact  that  the  hospital\n\nrecords showed that J.D. had left labial lesions that had not\n\nbeen  cultured it  was  imprudent  to  take  her  off  herpes\n\ninfection precautions.  He testified:\n\n             The probability or  the possibility of\n          her having transmission  -- transmissible\n          viruses  was  very  high  based  on   her\n          history and her presentation.\n\n          On cross-examination Dr.  Kahn was  asked, \"Is  the\n\nbest you can  say is that  J.D. is a  possible source of  the\n\nherpes  infection in  this case?\"    Then came  the following\n\nexchange:\n\n          A.  Comparing her  to the other  patient,\n          I'd say  very  possible.   But  again,  I\n          can't  say  probable   or  with  definite\n          certainty.      But   a   very   credible\n          likelihood.\n\n          Q.  So  the best you can say is possible,\n          but you cannot say probable, correct?\n\n          A.  Slightly high on the possible but not\n          probable.  \"Probable\"  meaning certainty,\n          high possible meaning that's my choice.\n\n          To our knowledge,  no New  Hampshire case  requires\n\nthe  incantation of the word \"probable\" to establish probable\n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\ncausation.   In  a case  involving  expert testimony  the New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court held:\n\n          The possibility that  the blasting caused\n          the damage could reasonably be found \"the\n          most  probable  possibility  disclosed by\n          the  evidence,\"  and  blasting  the  most\n          probable cause.

Wyman, Inc., 110 A.2d 271,  274 (N.H. 1954).\n                            \n\nIn Emery  v. Tilo Roofing  Company, 89  N.H. 165, 195  A. 409\n                                  \n\n(N.H. 1937), the issue was the cause of a fire to the roof of\n\na building.   Defendant  was hired to  re-roof the  building.\n\nThere  was  evidence  that  defendant's  employees  were seen\n\nsmoking  cigarettes  on  the roof  before  the  fire started.\n\nThere was no direct evidence that the fire had been caused by\n\na cigarette stub.   In upholding a verdict  for plaintiff the\n\ncourt stated:\n\n          That the fire  was caused by a  cigarette\n          stub  was the  most probable  possibility\n          disclosed by  the evidence  and we  think\n          that the  jury were justified  in finding\n          it  to  be more  probable  than otherwise\n          that the  fire resulted from  this cause.\n          Staples v. Railroad, 74 N.H. 499.  \"It is\n                             \n          not a  case of  conjecture between  equal\n          possibilities,    but     the    ordinary\n          determination   of   a   conclusion  from\n          inferences  supported  by  a  balance  of\n          probabilities.\"   Saad v.

Not only was the conclusion of\n          the  jury as  to the  cause  of the  fire\n          proper  as a  direct  inference from  the\n          testimony  but the  improbability of  any\n          other  explanation  \"as  an  exclusionary\n          premise may serve to strengthen the force\n          of the deduction.\"  \n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nId. at 167.\n   \n\n          In the  case before  us the  main defense  was that\n\nplaintiff was infected with herpes before she was admitted to\n\nthe  hospital.   There  was  no direct  evidence  of such  an\n\ninfection.  As with the plaintiff's evidence, it  depended on\n\nexpert testimony.\n\n          We  read Dr.  Kahn's  testimony  to  say  that  the\n\nprobable  cause of  the infection  was  one or  more acts  of\n\nnegligence  by the hospital,  and find that  this conclusion,\n\nwhich  was rationally supported  and explained, is sufficient\n\nto  establish  causation  even though  the  doctor  could not\n\nidentify  a single cause as the more-likely-than-not cause of\n\nthis infection.  It follows, therefore, that the jury verdict\n\nthat  the plaintiff was infected with  herpes while a patient\n\nat  the Mary Hitchcock  Memorial Hospital is  unassailable on\n\ncausation grounds.\n\n                             II.\n\n                  THE ADMISSION OF TESTIMONY\n                                            \n\n          Defendant's argument  on this  issue  is stated  as\n\nfollows:\n\n          The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion By\n          Allowing The Plaintiffs To Ask Nurse Watkins\n          Whether She Had Investigated The Source Of\n          Kimberly F.'s Infection\n\n          A.   Mrs. Watkins's Testimony About Her\n               Investigation on Behalf of the Infections\n               Committee Was Precluded by the Express\n               Terms of the Statute\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nAppellants' Brief at -i-.\n\n          We have scoured the record and can find no question\n\nby plaintiff's counsel on direct examination of Nurse Watkins\n\nasking \"whether she  had investigated the source  of Kimberly\n\nF.'s [plaintiff's] infection.\"  Nor have we been able to find\n\nany testimony  by Nurse  Watkins about  her investigation  on\n\nbehalf of the Infections Committee.\n\n          Nurse  Watkins testified  that plaintiff's  husband\n\nspoke  to  her  in  1986  about  the  source  of  plaintiff's\n\ninfection.    At  that  time  he was  employed  by  the  Mary\n\nHitchcock   Memorial   Hospital    as   an   echocardiography\n\ntechnologist   and  knew   Nurse  Watkins  as   a  co-worker.\n\nPlaintiff's   husband  knew   that  Nurse   Watkins'  special\n\nresponsibility was  infection  control  and  transmission  of\n\ninfectious  diseases.    According  to  Nurse  Watkins,  when\n\nplaintiff's  husband spoke  to  her  he  had  three  specific\n\nconcerns:    the  use  of  ice  packs,  lack  of  cleanliness\n\ngenerally  in  the hospital,  and the  dirty bathtub.   Nurse\n\nWatkins said  she would look  into it.   She denied  that the\n\nhusband asked her \"to inquire into a few things.\"   She never\n\ninformed the husband about anything bearing on the source  of\n\nplaintiff's infection.   Nor did she tell him  that she would\n\nmake an investigation  for the hospital.  Most  of the direct\n\nexamination of Nurse Watkins by plaintiff's  counsel focussed\n\non the  infection control  procedures used  at the  hospital.\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nNurse Watkins was  also asked questions about entries  in the\n\nplaintiff's  hospital records by  the doctors and  nurses who\n\ntreated her.\n\n          On   cross-examination  Nurse   Watkins  gave   the\n\nfollowing testimony: \n\n          Q.   Given   your   job  as   [sic]   the\n          hospital, as  nurse epidemiologist,  what\n          do you generally do when a, a question of\n          a hospital-acquired infection  is brought\n          to you?\n\n          A.   Well, it's my  job to look into  the\n          circumstances of the  infection, with the\n          primary   being  a   focus  to   identify\n          practices  which  could  be  improved  to\n          decrease the  risk of  similar infections\n          in the future.\n\n             I  also  had  the  responsibility  for\n          educating   hospital    personnel   about\n          infection risk and  transmission again so\n          that  their  practice will  decrease  the\n          risk of transmission.\n\n          Q.   Now, did  you take those  steps when\n          Mr.  F.  came to  you  and  suggested the\n          problems he did?\n\n          A.   Certainly   I   looked    into   the\n          situation, yes.\n\n          Q.   What did you conclude?\n\nThere was  an objection  by plaintiff's  counsel to  the last\n\nquestion which was upheld on the ground that it was precluded\n\nby N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 151:13-a (1981).\n\n          Before  we discuss the  scope of the  New Hampshire\n\nstatute we also  must point out  another serious omission  in\n\nthe record.  Defense counsel made no objection  to any of the\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nquestions  pertinent  to  this  issue  asked  by  plaintiff's\n\ncounsel.  This  was a waiver of the issue under Fed. R. Evid.\n\n103(a)(1).3   Nor is  this omission cured  because defendants\n\nhad  filed  a  motion  in  limine  at  the  start  of  trial.\n                                 \n\nObjections  to questions must be made  when the questions are\n\nasked.  We also  point out that there was not  even a general\n\nobjection to  the  line of  questioning, although  we do  not\n\nsuggest  that this  would have  been  sufficient to  preserve\n\ndefendants' rights.\n\n          The  pertinent  provision   of  the  New  Hampshire\n\nstatute provides:\n\n             II.  Records  of a hospital  committee\n          organized to evaluate matters relating to\n          the care  and treatment of patients or to\n          reduce   morbidity   and   mortality  and\n          testimony by  hospital trustees,  medical\n          staff,  employees,  or   other  committee\n          attendees relating  to activities  of the\n          quality  assurance  committee   shall  be\n          confidential and privileged  and shall be\n          protected from  direct or  indirect means\n          of discovery, subpoena, or admission into\n\n                    \n\n3.

Rev. Stat.  Ann. ch.  151:13-a II.   The  New Hampshire\n\nSupreme Court carefully  delineated the scope of  the statute\n\nin a case that was the opening chapter to the case before us.\n\nThe parties were the same; the issue concerned only the scope\n\nof the statute.  Justice Souter, then an associate justice of\n\nthe  New Hampshire Supreme  Court, wrote  the opinion,  In re\n                                                             \n\n\"K\", 561  A.2d 1063  (N.H.  1989).   In  the state  case  the\n   \n\nevidence was clear  that Nurse Watkins made  an investigation\n\nas to the source of plaintiff's infection, then made a report\n\nto the  Infections Committee  and prepared  a written  report\n\nwhich  was kept  in files  in  her own  office.   Plaintiff's\n\nlawyer  requested the  hospital,  through  Nurse Watkins,  to\n\nrelease  the  results  of the  investigation.    The hospital\n\nrefused,  claiming a  privilege under  N.H.  Rev. Stat.  Ann.\n\n151:13-a.   Plaintiff  then brought  a  petition in  the  New\n\nHampshire Superior  Court seeking  a disclosure  order.   The\n\nsuperior  court held  the privilege inapplicable  and ordered\n\ndisclosure  of Nurse Watkins' written report and the relevant\n\nportion  of the  minutes  of the  meeting  of the  Infections\n\nCommittee  at which  Nurse  Watkins  made  her report.    The\n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\nhospital appealed.  Id. at 1065.  After a lengthy explanation\n                       \n\nand  discussion of the legislation, the New Hampshire Supreme\n\nCourt  held that  the  minutes  of  the  Infection  Committee\n\nmeeting and Nurse Watkins' written report were insulated from\n\ndisclosure by the  New Hampshire statute.  Id. at  1065.  The\n                                              \n\ncourt also held:\n\n             Once, however,  it is  understood that\n          the  requisite  committee  structure  and\n          quality review function  are present, our\n          traditionally   limiting    approach   to\n          privilege  claims  must   be  honored  by\n          recognizing that  the privilege  does not\n          go  beyond the  records of  testimony, as\n          such, to which the statute refers.  As we\n          observed  before,  a   quality  assurance\n          committee's attention does  not place its\n          subject  matter  beyond   the  bounds  of\n          discovery  or  disclosure in  the  normal\n          course; the privilege  is confined to the\n          records  and testimony  described in  the\n          statute.     See  N.H.S.   Jour.  1410-14\n                                          \n          (1981).   Thus, the ordinary  record of a\n          patient's treatment remains admissible as\n          it always has been, even though a quality\n          assurance committee may have studied that\n          record and  issued a report based on data\n          culled from  it.   And  a  physician  may\n          still be  obligated to testify  about the\n          course of a patient's case, and to render\n          a   professional   evaluation    of   the\n          treatment,   even   though    a   quality\n          assurance  committee  may   already  have\n          elicited the  same testimony on  the same\n          subject   in  the   course  of   its  own\n          proceedings.\n\nId. at 1070.\n   \n\n          We  have  no   difficulty  finding  that  the   New\n\nHampshire  statute   was   not  implicated   by  the   direct\n\nexamination  of Nurse Watkins  in the  case at  bar.   It was\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\narguably  implicated  by defendants'  cross-examination,  but\n\nthat is not an issue before us.   It is incredible to us that\n\ndefendants would  misstate  in their  argument the  questions\n\nasked and  the testimony  given, fail to  object at  trial to\n\nquestions and answers which they now claim led to a violation\n\nof  the statute, deliberately implicate the statute on cross-\n\nexamination, and  still  appeal the  issue.   This  not  only\n\ntranscends  the  proper  limit   of  appellate  argument,  it\n\nrequires a good measure of \"chutzpa.\"\n\n                             -22-\n                              22\n\n                             III.\n\n                     THE CLOSING ARGUMENT\n                                         \n\n          At  the close of  his argument, plaintiff's counsel\n\nstated:\n\n             I gave a figure to you in the opening,\n          that I  would suggest that  you seriously\n          consider as  a full,  fair, adequate  and\n          reasonable  compensation  for  what  they\n          have  suffered, what  they are  suffering\n          and  what they  will suffer.    And as  I\n          promised you  then, I  will say  it again\n          now.\n\n             I  think I would suggest to you -- not\n          I  think.  What I think doesn't count.  I\n          would  suggest   to  you   that  on   the\n          evidence,   one   million   five  hundred\n          thousand  dollars  for Kimberly  and  one\n          million five hundred thousand dollars for\n          John is adequate, fair, full and complete\n          compensation for their interests.\n\n          In Davis  v. Browning-Ferris Industries,  Inc., 898\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 836 (1st Cir.  1990), we held that, even  in a diversity\n\ncase, the question of whether the amount of the ad damnum can\n                                                         \n\nbe  disclosed  to the  jury  is  a  matter of  procedure  and\n\ntherefore federal law  applies.  Id. at  837.  We went  on to\n                                    \n\nhold that such disclosure was improper.  Id. at 837-38.\n                                            \n\n          Inexplicably, both  parties addressed  the question\n\nbelow   as  exclusively  one   of  New  Hampshire   law  and,\n\nunfortunately, persuaded the district judge, a visiting judge\n\nfrom Pennsylvania, that  New Hampshire law controlled.   Just\n\nprior to final  argument defense counsel asked the court that\n\nit preclude  plaintiff's counsel from  expressing his opinion\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nabout  the dollar value  of the case  or referring to  the ad\n                                                             \n\ndamnum in  his argument.   Plaintiff's  counsel had,  without\n      \n\nobjection, stated the amount of the ad damnum in his opening.\n                                             \n\nThe  court therefore  asked:   \"You  mean it's  all right  on\n\nopening  statement  but  not on  closing?\"    Defense counsel\n\nstated:  \"If  I knew  he was going  to say it  on opening,  I\n\nwould  have objected but  rather than my  saying anything and\n\nobject and make  a bigger deal about it, I  made the judgment\n\nnot to.\"  The judge stated,  after plaintiff's counsel argued\n\nthat under New  Hampshire law reference to the  ad damnum was\n                                                         \n\nallowed:  \n\n             THE COURT:   Coming  from the  Common-\n          wealth  of  Pennsylvania  my  ears  stood\n          straight up  when I heard you mention the\n          figures  in your  opening statement,  but\n          hearing  no  objection   I  assumed  that\n          probably   was  the   practice  in   this\n          jurisdiction.\n\nThe court then asked plaintiff's  counsel to supply him  with\n\nauthority for his position.\n\n          The  court's  observation illustrates  why  counsel\n\nshould object at  the time an incorrect statement  is made by\n\nopposing counsel.   If an objection  had been made to  the ad\n                                                             \n\ndamnum disclosure in the opening, there would have been  time\n      \n\nfor some research  by the court and counsel  prior to closing\n\nargument,  and it probably  would have been  ascertained that\n\nthere was a  First Circuit case that clearly  controlled.  As\n\nit  was,  the  court  did  not  make  a  ruling  until  after\n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\ndefendants'  argument.  It ruled that under New Hampshire law\n\nthe  ad  damnum could  be  disclosed  to  the jury  in  final\n               \n\nargument.\n\n          We are faced, therefore, with a ruling based on the\n\nwrong law.   This was  due primarily  to the neglect  of both\n\ncounsel.   We would think that  counsel would be aware of the\n\ncontrolling First Circuit  cases by the time of  trial.  That\n\nplain error was committed is clear, but it is also clear that\n\nthe error was harmless.   The ad damnum was in  the amount of\n                                       \n\none million  five hundred  dollars for each  plaintiff.   The\n\njury awarded  plaintiff one hundred  and twenty-five thousand\n\ndollars  and  her   husband  twenty-five  thousand   dollars.\n\nClearly, the jury  paid scant attention to the  amount of the\n\nad damnum.   Under  the circumstances, there  is no  point in\n         \n\nsending the case back for a new trial.\n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          The judgment  below  is affirmed.    Appellees  are\n                                                             \n\nawarded costs of appeal.  \nawarded costs of appeal.\n                        \n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n",

John F.'s suit was for loss of consortium.  We, therefore, treat the plaintiffs as one.  The Hitchcock Clinic, Inc. is an incorporated association of physicians and surgeons, some of whom treated Kimberly F. while she was at the hospital.  Because of the nature of Kimberly F.'s injury, it was agreed that she and her husband could use pseudonyms to keep some degree of anonymity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kimberly F. was admitted to the obstetrical unit of the hospital on August 2, 1986.  She gave birth to a son on August 3. The child was full term.  There were no birth complications, and she was discharged on August 5. One week later, on August 13, Kimberly F. was diagnosed as having an outbreak of genital herpes.  She subsequently sued the defendants alleging that she was infected with herpes while at the hospital and that defendants negligently failed to protect her from such infection.  Plaintiff also brought a count for failure to obtain informed consent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The jury found defendants not liable on this count and there has been no appeal from this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants raise three issues before us:  that, as a matter of law, there was insufficient evidence for the jury's finding of negligence;  that testimony was improperly admitted;  and that the closing argument of plaintiff's counsel on pain and suffering was improper.  We discuss the issues seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ruling on an appeal from the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, we conduct a plenary review of the evidence.  Our review of the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom is made in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.   American Private Line Services, Inc. v. Eastern Microwave, Inc., et al., 980 F.2d 33, 35 (1st Cir. 1992);  Gallagher v. Wilton Enterprises, Inc., 962 F.2d 120, 124 (1st Cir. 1992).  The denial of a motion for judgment n.o.v. is also subject to plenary review.  The standard of review is whether the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom could lead a reasonable person to but one conclusion:  that the moving party was entitled to judgment.  Pontarelli v. Stone, 930 F.2d 104, 113 (1st Cir. 1991);  Hendricks &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Daewoo Corp., 923 F.2d 209, 214 (1st Cir. 1991).  We have conducted the requisite review and find that the district court was correct in denying the motions for a directed verdict and judgment n.o.v.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff was as follows.  When she was admitted to the hospital on August 2, 1986, plaintiff had no prior history of herpes.  When plaintiff was examined by defendants on August 13, she was diagnosed as having an outbreak of genital herpes.  Such an outbreak is characterized by lesions in the infected area.  The incubation period for a herpes infection is two to twenty-six days.  Plaintiff entered the hospital on August 2, was discharged on August 5, and the medical diagnosis of genital herpes was made on August 13.  She was well within the herpes incubation period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Genital herpes is a life-long affliction and, as is true of other types of herpes, is incurable.  Outbreaks of herpes, manifested by lesions and cold sores, occur from time to time during the victim's life.  The first attack is usually the most severe.  The genital herpes outbreak diagnosed on August 13 was a primary (first-ever) outbreak, i.e., plaintiff never had a herpes outbreak prior to this time.  Plaintiff's sexual history was as follows.  She had sexual intercourse twice in high school;  both times her partners used condoms.  She married for the first time in 1981.  After her first child was born she was divorced.  The divorce became final in 1982 or 1983.  She met her present husband in 1984.  She had no sexual relations with other men between separating from her first husband and meeting her present one.  Neither she nor her husband had ever engaged in oral sex at any time.  Plaintiff's husband has never had any herpes symptoms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When plaintiff was first admitted to the hospital she was put in a birthing room that shared a bathroom with another patient.  Plaintiff went into the bathroom alone because no one had come in response to her pushing the nurses' call button.  She felt dizzy and sat on the toilet to avoid falling.  In so doing, she sat on a urine catch basin that was in the toilet bowl.  The basin contained urine from the other patient.  As her labor pains increased in frequency, a nurse suggested a warm bath might help.  She was taken to a room with a bathtub.  Both she and her husband noted that the tub contained some dead bugs.  There was an open window with no screen.  Plaintiff's husband cleaned out the tub and she took a bath.  During the birthing process, an episiotomy was done.  This consists of making a surgical incision into the perineum and vagina so as to prevent tearing during delivery.  Prior to delivery, nurses examined plaintiff internally to see whether her cervix had dilated.  Some of the nurses did not wash their hands in the sink in plaintiff's room before examining her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After delivery, plaintiff experienced pain and discomfort at the site of the episiotomy.  Reusable plastic ice packs were applied to ease her discomfort.  The ice packs were wrapped in sterile green surgical cloth.  At times, the pack was placed over plaintiff's vaginal area in such a way that the surgical cloth did not completely cover the plastic bag.  This resulted in direct contact between the site of the episiotomy and the plastic bag.  On the day of plaintiff's discharge a nurse came in and checked plaintiff's perineal area and touched the episiotomy site with her hands.  The nurse had not washed her hands, nor was she wearing gloves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 31, a patient was admitted to the obstetrics unit of the hospital with a herpes lesion behind her right knee.  The patient was placed on herpes isolation precautions during all of the time she was at the hospital.  This entailed strict procedures to prevent the patient's herpes infection from spreading to other patients.  This patient was discharged on the morning of August 2; plaintiff was admitted at 11:30 p.m.  on August 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second patient with herpes was in the maternity ward at the same time as plaintiff.  This patient, \"J.D.,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> occupied the same room as did plaintiff immediately prior to plaintiff being put in the room.  The records of J.D. show that because she had had monthly episodes of herpes outbreaks during her pregnancy, she was admitted \"at risk,\" and was placed on herpes infection precautions.  A herpes culture was taken from J.D.'s right labial lesion on July 28.  It was noted in her records that she was at high risk and herpes infection precautions were continued.  J.D. gave birth via a Caesarean section on July 29.  Her records show that the reasons for the Caesarean section were that the baby was breached and that J.D. was at risk with herpes.  On July 30, a nurse's note in J.D.'s records stated that she had two lesions on the left outer lower labia.  A subsequent note on the same day states that J.D. continued to have lesions on the left lower labia.  There is nothing in the record indicating that any culture was taken from the lesions on her left lower labia.  The only culture taken was from the lesion on the right labia.  The lab report on this culture was necessarily a preliminary one;  it was negative for herpes.  A negative culture report on herpes normally includes the statement, \"these results do not exclude infection with herpes simplex virus.\"  This report did not so state.  On the evening of August 2, the day that plaintiff was admitted to the hospital, J.D. was transferred to the second floor.  Later that evening she told a nurse that she was concerned about the fact that she was still on herpes infection precautions.  The nurse, Linda Morgan, recorded in her chart that J.D. wanted to be taken off herpes infection precautions and that she had shown no lesions since July 29.  This information was given by telephone to Dr. Ketterer and the same night, August 2, he gave a verbal order to remove J.D. from herpes precautions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nurse Morgan admitted during her testimony that she did not tell Dr. Ketterer about the lesions on J.D.'s left labial area.  Dr. Ketterer admitted that his decision to take J.D. off herpes infection precautions was based on incomplete information.  About two hours after J.D. was taken off precautions, plaintiff was admitted to the hospital.  She spent the next eight hours in labor and delivery on the second floor, where J.D. was also located.  Both plaintiff and J.D. were discharged from the hospital on the same day, August 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two nurses, J.W. and M.W., had herpes and worked in the maternity ward of the hospital while plaintiff was a patient there.  J.W. had a history of genital herpes.  She gave direct patient care to plaintiff, which included placing ice packs on her perineum and physically examining her.  There was no direct evidence that the other nurse with herpes, M.W., had patient contact with plaintiff, but she was present on the maternity ward and available to give care to all of the patients in the ward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the doctors who testified agreed, in effect, that it would be a violation of acceptable hospital infection precautions for a patient to be infected by herpes while a hospital patient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Testimony of Plaintiff's Expert Witness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' attack on the sufficiency of the evidence focuses on the testimony of plaintiff's expert witness, Dr. James Kahn.  Their claim is that \"no expert witness identified any act of negligence that more probably than not caused the infection.\"  Appellants' Brief at 9. Both sides agree that New Hampshire law controls this issue.  We will therefore examine New Hampshire law and rule accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In  Thorpe v. New Hampshire Department of Corrections, 575 A.2d 351, 353 (N.H. 1990), the court stated:  \"The general rule in medical malpractice cases is that the proximate cause between the negligence and the injury must be established through expert testimony.\"  In  Martin v. Wentworth-Douglass Hospital, 536 A.2d 174, 176 (N.H. 1987), the court held that expert testimony was necessary to establish the causal link between the injury complained of and the health care provider sought to be held accountable, and \"[t]he quantum of such evidence necessary to survive a motion for nonsuit had to be enough to warrant the conclusion of a reasonable juror that the causal link probably existed.\"   See also Wilder v. Eberhart, 977 F.2d 673, 676 (1st Cir. 1992).  In  Pillsbury-Flood v. Portsmouth Hospital, 512 A.2d 1126 (N.H. 1986), the court held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In New Hampshire, the plaintiff in a medical malpractice action must prove that the defendant's negligence caused the patient's injury or loss.   See Carrigan v. Sacred Heart Hospital, 104 N.H. 73, 80, 178 A.2d 502, 506-07 (1962).  \"[N]egligent conduct is a proximate or legal cause of harm, if the actor's conduct is a 'substantial factor in bringing about the harm.' \"   Maxfield v. Maxfield, 102 N.H. 101, 105, 151 A.2d 226, 230 (1959) (quoting Restatement of Torts &#167; 431(a) (1934)).  This issue is normally one for the trier of fact once a prima facie case is established.  See id.;  W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts &#167; 41, at 269 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter cited as Prosser &amp; Keeton).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1129.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to Dr. Kahn's testimony.  There was no objection to Dr. Kahn's expert qualifications in the field of infectious diseases.  The crux of his testimony came in the answers to a series of questions.  Dr. Kahn was asked:  \"Based on your review of all the information, do you have an opinion, based on reasonable medical probabilities, as to whether or not Mrs. F.'s infection, outbreak of herpes in August of 1986 was a primary infection?\"  He answered:  \"Yes, I continue to feel very emphatically that it was a primary infection.\"  In prior testimony Dr. Kahn had explained that the term \"primary infection\" meant a first-ever herpes infection.  Dr. Kahn had explained the nature of herpes infections and how outbreaks of the disease are manifested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next question bearing on the issue was:  \"Do you have an opinion, based on reasonable medical probabilities, as to whether or not the hospital was the probable source of-general source of Kimberly F.'s infection in August of 1986?\"  Dr. Kahn answered that the infection was clearly associated with the plaintiff's hospitalization.  The following question was then asked:  \"What were the possible means of transmission within the hospital that could have resulted in her infection?\"  There was an objection based on the use of the word \"possible;\" that \"the plaintiffs' burden of proof is probabilities.\"  The court denied the objection, pointing out that the main question was premised on reasonable medical probabilities, and these were the factors the expert considered in arriving at his opinion.  Dr. Kahn was asked again to state the possible sources of plaintiff's infection.  He answered: \"The likeliest, I think, is another patient who at the time of your client's hospitalization had what to all intents and purposes sounded like a recurrent genital herpes outbreak and in at least one instance shared a care giver over a short period of time.\"  This answer was followed by a series of questions and answers:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>What is your understanding as to whether or not there was any potential patient source at the hospital?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>A. My understanding from reading the record is that there were two patients that I'm aware of who had what was either diagnosed by somebody else as an active herpes infection or to my reading certainly compatible with an active herpes infection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Q. Were both those patients possible sources?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>A. Yes, I think they're both possible sources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Q. Would you consider health care workers as possible sources?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>A. Yes, they're possible sources too, yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his prior testimony Dr. Kahn had discussed inanimate objects-called fomites-such as toilet seats, flat surfaces and ice packs, as potential transmission sources of herpes.  He was asked if he considered fomites as a possible infection source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I did.  I considered them, but my own judgment is that that's considerably less likely.  I know there was one instance in particular-I don't know if it's been raised before so I don't know if I should mention it-well, I read it so I guess I can mention there was some talk about an ice pack applied to the perineum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My sense of that was that even though the ice pack could have been wrapped in gauze and therefore, could have held the virus in it, it was more consistent with what we know about herpes transmission, that it was the hand of the nurse applying the ice pack rather than the ice pack that would have been the likelier source of transmission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Dr. Kahn was then asked:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having considered all of the potential sources of infection, did you arrive at one that was most likely in your mind?</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>His answer was:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think the likeliest explanation is the patient who had vaginal lesions with a second crop on the left labia, I believe, and was taken care of at one point by a health care giver who very shortly thereafter took care of Kim [plaintiff].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Kahn identified the patient as J.D. He then testified that, in light of the fact that the hospital records showed that J.D. had left labial lesions that had not been cultured it was imprudent to take her off herpes infection precautions.  He testified:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probability or the possibility of her having transmission-transmissible viruses was very high based on her history and her presentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination Dr. Kahn was asked, \"Is the best you can say is that J.D. is a possible source of the herpes infection in this case?\"  Then came the following exchange:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.  Comparing her to the other patient, I'd say very possible.  But again, I can't say probable or with definite certainty.  But a very credible likelihood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>Q. So the best you can say is possible, but you cannot say probable, correct?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>A. Slightly high on the possible but not probable. \"Probable\" meaning certainty, high possible meaning that's my choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To our knowledge, no New Hampshire case requires the incantation of the word \"probable\" to establish probable causation.  In a case involving expert testimony the New Hampshire Supreme Court held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>The possibility that the blasting caused the damage could reasonably be found \"the most probable possibility disclosed by the evidence,\" and blasting the most probable cause.

Defendant was hired to re-roof the building.  There was evidence that defendant's employees were seen smoking cigarettes on the roof before the fire started.  There was no direct evidence that the fire had been caused by a cigarette stub.  In upholding a verdict for plaintiff the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>That the fire was caused by a cigarette stub was the most probable possibility disclosed by the evidence and we think that the jury were justified in finding it to be more probable than otherwise that the fire resulted from this cause.   Staples v. Railroad, 74 N.H. 499.  \"It is not a case of conjecture between equal possibilities, but the ordinary determination of a conclusion from inferences supported by a balance of probabilities.\"   Saad v. Papageorge, 82 N.H. 294.  Not only was the conclusion of the jury as to the cause of the fire proper as a direct inference from the testimony but the improbability of any other explanation \"as an exclusionary premise may serve to strengthen the force of the deduction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 167.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case before us the main defense was that plaintiff was infected with herpes before she was admitted to the hospital.  There was no direct evidence of such an infection.  As with the plaintiff's evidence, it depended on expert testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We read Dr. Kahn's testimony to say that the probable cause of the infection was one or more acts of negligence by the hospital, and find that this conclusion, which was rationally supported and explained, is sufficient to establish causation even though the doctor could not identify a single cause as the more-likely-than-not cause of this infection.  It follows, therefore, that the jury verdict that the plaintiff was infected with herpes while a patient at the Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital is unassailable on causation grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>THE ADMISSION OF TESTIMONY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>Defendant's argument on this issue is stated as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion By Allowing The Plaintiffs To Ask Nurse Watkins Whether She Had Investigated The Source Of Kimberly F.'s Infection</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

At that time he was employed by the Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital as an echocardiography technologist and knew Nurse Watkins as a co-worker.  Plaintiff's husband knew that Nurse Watkins' special responsibility was infection control and transmission of infectious diseases.  According to Nurse Watkins, when plaintiff's husband spoke to her he had three specific concerns:  the use of ice packs, lack of cleanliness generally in the hospital, and the dirty bathtub.  Nurse Watkins said she would look into it.  She denied that the husband asked her \"to inquire into a few things.\"  She never informed the husband about anything bearing on the source of plaintiff's infection.  Nor did she tell him that she would make an investigation for the hospital.  Most of the direct examination of Nurse Watkins by plaintiff's counsel focussed on the infection control procedures used at the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nurse Watkins was also asked questions about entries in the plaintiff's hospital records by the doctors and nurses who treated her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination Nurse Watkins gave the following testimony:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>Q. Given your job as  [sic] the hospital, as nurse epidemiologist, what do you generally do when a, a question of a hospital-acquired infection is brought to you?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>A. Well, it's my job to look into the circumstances of the infection, with the primary being a focus to identify practices which could be improved to decrease the risk of similar infections in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also had the responsibility for educating hospital personnel about infection risk and transmission again so that their practice will decrease the risk of transmission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>Q. Now, did you take those steps when Mr. F. came to you and suggested the problems he did?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>A.

What did you conclude?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was an objection by plaintiff's counsel to the last question which was upheld on the ground that it was precluded by N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. ch. 151:13-a (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we discuss the scope of the New Hampshire statute we also must point out another serious omission in the record.  Defense counsel made no objection to any of the questions pertinent to this issue asked by plaintiff's counsel.  This was a waiver of the issue under Fed.  R. Evid. 103(a)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Nor is this omission cured because defendants had filed a motion in limine at the start of trial.  Objections to questions must be made when the questions are asked.  We also point out that there was not even a general objection to the line of questioning, although we do not suggest that this would have been sufficient to preserve defendants' rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent provision of the New Hampshire statute provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>II.  Records of a hospital committee organized to evaluate matters relating to the care and treatment of patients or to reduce morbidity and mortality and testimony by hospital trustees, medical staff, employees, or other committee attendees relating to activities of the quality assurance committee shall be confidential and privileged and shall be protected from direct or indirect means of discovery, subpoena, or admission into evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding, except that in the case of a legal action brought by a quality assurance committee to revoke or restrict a physician's license or hospital staff privileges, or in a proceeding alleging repetitive malicious action and personal injury brought against a physician, a committee's records shall be discoverable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. ch. 151:13-a II.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court carefully delineated the scope of the statute in a case that was the opening chapter to the case before us.  The parties were the same;  the issue concerned only the scope of the statute.  Justice Souter, then an associate justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, wrote the opinion, In re \"K\", 561 A.2d 1063 (N.H. 1989).  In the state case the evidence was clear that Nurse Watkins made an investigation as to the source of plaintiff's infection, then made a report to the Infections Committee and prepared a written report which was kept in files in her own office.  Plaintiff's lawyer requested the hospital, through Nurse Watkins, to release the results of the investigation.  The hospital refused, claiming a privilege under N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. 151:13-a.  Plaintiff then brought a petition in the New Hampshire Superior Court seeking a disclosure order.  The superior court held the privilege inapplicable and ordered disclosure of Nurse Watkins' written report and the relevant portion of the minutes of the meeting of the Infections Committee at which Nurse Watkins made her report.  The hospital appealed.   Id. at 1065.  After a lengthy explanation and discussion of the legislation, the New Hampshire Supreme Court held that the minutes of the Infection Committee meeting and Nurse Watkins' written report were insulated from disclosure by the New Hampshire statute.   Id. at 1065.  The court also held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>Once, however, it is understood that the requisite committee structure and quality review function are present, our traditionally limiting approach to privilege claims must be honored by recognizing that the privilege does not go beyond the records of testimony, as such, to which the statute refers.  As we observed before, a quality assurance committee's attention does not place its subject matter beyond the bounds of discovery or disclosure  in the normal course;  the privilege is confined to the records and testimony described in the statute.  See N.H.S. Jour. 1410-14 (1981).  Thus, the ordinary record of a patient's treatment remains admissible as it always has been, even though a quality assurance committee may have studied that record and issued a report based on data culled from it.  And a physician may still be obligated to testify about the course of a patient's case, and to render a professional evaluation of the treatment, even though a quality assurance committee may already have elicited the same testimony on the same subject in the course of its own proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1070.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no difficulty finding that the New Hampshire statute was not implicated by the direct examination of Nurse Watkins in the case at bar.  It was arguably implicated by defendants' cross-examination, but that is not an issue before us.  It is incredible to us that defendants would misstate in their argument the questions asked and the testimony given, fail to object at trial to questions and answers which they now claim led to a violation of the statute, deliberately implicate the statute on cross-examination, and still appeal the issue.  This not only transcends the proper limit of appellate argument, it requires a good measure of \"chutzpa.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>THE CLOSING ARGUMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of his argument, plaintiff's counsel stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I gave a figure to you in the opening, that I would suggest that you seriously consider as a full, fair, adequate and reasonable compensation for what they have suffered, what they are suffering and what they will suffer.  And as I promised you then, I will say it again now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think I would suggest to you-not I think.  What I think doesn't count.  I would suggest to you that on the evidence, one million five hundred thousand dollars for Kimberly and one million five hundred thousand dollars for John is adequate, fair, full and complete compensation for their interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In  Davis v. Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc., 898 F.2d 836 (1st Cir. 1990), we held that, even in a diversity case, the question of whether the amount of the ad damnum can be disclosed to the jury is a matter of procedure and therefore federal law applies.   Id. at 837.  We went on to hold that such disclosure was improper.   Id. at 837-38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inexplicably, both parties addressed the question below as exclusively one of New Hampshire law and, unfortunately, persuaded the district judge, a visiting judge from Pennsylvania, that New Hampshire law controlled.  Just prior to final argument defense counsel asked the court that it preclude plaintiff's counsel from expressing his opinion about the dollar value of the case or referring to the ad damnum in his argument.  Plaintiff's counsel had, without objection, stated the amount of the ad damnum in his opening.  The court therefore asked:  \"You mean it's all right on opening statement but not on closing?\"  Defense counsel stated: \"If I knew he was going to say it on opening, I would have objected but rather than my saying anything and object and make a bigger deal about it, I made the judgment not to.\"  The judge stated, after plaintiff's counsel argued that under New Hampshire law reference to the ad damnum was allowed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Coming from the Common-wealth of Pennsylvania my ears stood straight up when I heard you mention the figures in your opening statement, but hearing no objection I assumed that probably was the practice in this jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then asked plaintiff's counsel to supply him with authority for his position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's observation illustrates why counsel should object at the time an incorrect statement is made by opposing counsel.  If an objection had been made to the ad damnum disclosure in the opening, there would have been time for some research by the court and counsel prior to closing argument, and it probably would have been ascertained that there was a First Circuit case that clearly controlled.  As it was, the court did not make a ruling until after defendants' argument.  It ruled that under New Hampshire law the ad damnum could be disclosed to the jury in final argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are faced, therefore, with a ruling based on the wrong law.  This was due primarily to the neglect of both counsel.  We would think that counsel would be aware of the controlling First Circuit cases by the time of trial.  That plain error was committed is clear, but it is also clear that the error was harmless.  The ad damnum was in the amount of one million five hundred dollars for each plaintiff.  The jury awarded plaintiff one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars and her husband twenty-five thousand dollars.  Clearly, the jury paid scant attention to the amount of the ad damnum.  Under the circumstances, there is no point in sending the case back for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment below is affirmed.

John F.'s suit was for loss of consortium.  We, therefore, treat the plaintiffs as one.  The Hitchcock Clinic, Inc. is an incorporated association of physicians and surgeons, some of whom treated Kimberly F. while she was at the hospital.  Because of the nature of Kimberly F.'s injury, it was agreed that she and her husband could use pseudonyms to keep some degree of anonymity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kimberly F. was admitted to the obstetrical unit of the hospital on August 2, 1986.

One week later, on August 13, Kimberly F. was diagnosed as having an outbreak of genital herpes.  She subsequently sued the defendants alleging that she was infected with herpes while at the hospital and that defendants negligently failed to protect her from such infection.  Plaintiff also brought a count for failure to obtain informed consent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The jury found defendants not liable on this count and there has been no appeal from this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants raise three issues before us:  that, as a matter of law, there was insufficient evidence for the jury's finding of negligence;  that testimony was improperly admitted;  and that the closing argument of plaintiff's counsel on pain and suffering was improper.

The Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff was as follows.  When she was admitted to the hospital on August 2, 1986, plaintiff had no prior history of herpes.  When plaintiff was examined by defendants on August 13, she was diagnosed as having an outbreak of genital herpes.  Such an outbreak is characterized by lesions in the infected area.  The incubation period for a herpes infection is two to twenty-six days.  Plaintiff entered the hospital on August 2, was discharged on August 5, and the medical diagnosis of genital herpes was made on August 13.  She was well within the herpes incubation period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Genital herpes is a life-long affliction and, as is true of other types of herpes, is incurable.  Outbreaks of herpes, manifested by lesions and cold sores, occur from time to time during the victim's life.  The first attack is usually the most severe.  The genital herpes outbreak diagnosed on August 13 was a primary (first-ever) outbreak, i.e., plaintiff never had a herpes outbreak prior to this time.  Plaintiff's sexual history was as follows.  She had sexual intercourse twice in high school;  both times her partners used condoms.  She married for the first time in 1981.  After her first child was born she was divorced.  The divorce became final in 1982 or 1983.  She met her present husband in 1984.  She had no sexual relations with other men between separating from her first husband and meeting her present one.  Neither she nor her husband had ever engaged in oral sex at any time.  Plaintiff's husband has never had any herpes symptoms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When plaintiff was first admitted to the hospital she was put in a birthing room that shared a bathroom with another patient.  Plaintiff went into the bathroom alone because no one had come in response to her pushing the nurses' call button.  She felt dizzy and sat on the toilet to avoid falling.  In so doing, she sat on a urine catch basin that was in the toilet bowl.  The basin contained urine from the other patient.  As her labor pains increased in frequency, a nurse suggested a warm bath might help.  She was taken to a room with a bathtub.  Both she and her husband noted that the tub contained some dead bugs.  There was an open window with no screen.  Plaintiff's husband cleaned out the tub and she took a bath.  During the birthing process, an episiotomy was done.  This consists of making a surgical incision into the perineum and vagina so as to prevent tearing during delivery.  Prior to delivery, nurses examined plaintiff internally to see whether her cervix had dilated.  Some of the nurses did not wash their hands in the sink in plaintiff's room before examining her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After delivery, plaintiff experienced pain and discomfort at the site of the episiotomy.  Reusable plastic ice packs were applied to ease her discomfort.  The ice packs were wrapped in sterile green surgical cloth.  At times, the pack was placed over plaintiff's vaginal area in such a way that the surgical cloth did not completely cover the plastic bag.  This resulted in direct contact between the site of the episiotomy and the plastic bag.  On the day of plaintiff's discharge a nurse came in and checked plaintiff's perineal area and touched the episiotomy site with her hands.  The nurse had not washed her hands, nor was she wearing gloves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 31, a patient was admitted to the obstetrics unit of the hospital with a herpes lesion behind her right knee.  The patient was placed on herpes isolation precautions during all of the time she was at the hospital.  This entailed strict procedures to prevent the patient's herpes infection from spreading to other patients.  This patient was discharged on the morning of August 2; plaintiff was admitted at 11:30 p.m.  on August 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second patient with herpes was in the maternity ward at the same time as plaintiff.  This patient, \"J.D.,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> occupied the same room as did plaintiff immediately prior to plaintiff being put in the room.  The records of J.D. show that because she had had monthly episodes of herpes outbreaks during her pregnancy, she was admitted \"at risk,\" and was placed on herpes infection precautions.  A herpes culture was taken from J.D.'s right labial lesion on July 28.  It was noted in her records that she was at high risk and herpes infection precautions were continued.  J.D. gave birth via a Caesarean section on July 29.  Her records show that the reasons for the Caesarean section were that the baby was breached and that J.D. was at risk with herpes.  On July 30, a nurse's note in J.D.'s records stated that she had two lesions on the left outer lower labia.  A subsequent note on the same day states that J.D. continued to have lesions on the left lower labia.  There is nothing in the record indicating that any culture was taken from the lesions on her left lower labia.  The only culture taken was from the lesion on the right labia.  The lab report on this culture was necessarily a preliminary one;  it was negative for herpes.  A negative culture report on herpes normally includes the statement, \"these results do not exclude infection with herpes simplex virus.\"  This report did not so state.  On the evening of August 2, the day that plaintiff was admitted to the hospital, J.D. was transferred to the second floor.  Later that evening she told a nurse that she was concerned about the fact that she was still on herpes infection precautions.  The nurse, Linda Morgan, recorded in her chart that J.D. wanted to be taken off herpes infection precautions and that she had shown no lesions since July 29.  This information was given by telephone to Dr. Ketterer and the same night, August 2, he gave a verbal order to remove J.D. from herpes precautions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nurse Morgan admitted during her testimony that she did not tell Dr. Ketterer about the lesions on J.D.'s left labial area.  Dr. Ketterer admitted that his decision to take J.D. off herpes infection precautions was based on incomplete information.  About two hours after J.D. was taken off precautions, plaintiff was admitted to the hospital.  She spent the next eight hours in labor and delivery on the second floor, where J.D. was also located.  Both plaintiff and J.D. were discharged from the hospital on the same day, August 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two nurses, J.W. and M.W., had herpes and worked in the maternity ward of the hospital while plaintiff was a patient there.  J.W. had a history of genital herpes.  She gave direct patient care to plaintiff, which included placing ice packs on her perineum and physically examining her.  There was no direct evidence that the other nurse with herpes, M.W., had patient contact with plaintiff, but she was present on the maternity ward and available to give care to all of the patients in the ward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the doctors who testified agreed, in effect, that it would be a violation of acceptable hospital infection precautions for a patient to be infected by herpes while a hospital patient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Testimony of Plaintiff's Expert Witness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' attack on the sufficiency of the evidence focuses on the testimony of plaintiff's expert witness, Dr. James Kahn.  Their claim is that \"no expert witness identified any act of negligence that more probably than not caused the infection.\"  Appellants' Brief at 9.

We will therefore examine New Hampshire law and rule accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In  Thorpe v.

There was no objection to Dr. Kahn's expert qualifications in the field of infectious diseases.  The crux of his testimony came in the answers to a series of questions.  Dr. Kahn was asked:  \"Based on your review of all the information, do you have an opinion, based on reasonable medical probabilities, as to whether or not Mrs. F.'s infection, outbreak of herpes in August of 1986 was a primary infection?\"  He answered:  \"Yes, I continue to feel very emphatically that it was a primary infection.\"  In prior testimony Dr. Kahn had explained that the term \"primary infection\" meant a first-ever herpes infection.  Dr. Kahn had explained the nature of herpes infections and how outbreaks of the disease are manifested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next question bearing on the issue was:  \"Do you have an opinion, based on reasonable medical probabilities, as to whether or not the hospital was the probable source of-general source of Kimberly F.'s infection in August of 1986?\"  Dr. Kahn answered that the infection was clearly associated with the plaintiff's hospitalization.  The following question was then asked:  \"What were the possible means of transmission within the hospital that could have resulted in her infection?\"  There was an objection based on the use of the word \"possible;\" that \"the plaintiffs' burden of proof is probabilities.\"  The court denied the objection, pointing out that the main question was premised on reasonable medical probabilities, and these were the factors the expert considered in arriving at his opinion.  Dr. Kahn was asked again to state the possible sources of plaintiff's infection.  He answered: \"The likeliest, I think, is another patient who at the time of your client's hospitalization had what to all intents and purposes sounded like a recurrent genital herpes outbreak and in at least one instance shared a care giver over a short period of time.\"  This answer was followed by a series of questions and answers:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>What is your understanding as to whether or not there was any potential patient source at the hospital?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>A. My understanding from reading the record is that there were two patients that I'm aware of who had what was either diagnosed by somebody else as an active herpes infection or to my reading certainly compatible with an active herpes infection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Q. Were both those patients possible sources?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>A. Yes, I think they're both possible sources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Q.

Yes, they're possible sources too, yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his prior testimony Dr. Kahn had discussed inanimate objects-called fomites-such as toilet seats, flat surfaces and ice packs, as potential transmission sources of herpes.  He was asked if he considered fomites as a possible infection source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I did.  I considered them, but my own judgment is that that's considerably less likely.  I know there was one instance in particular-I don't know if it's been raised before so I don't know if I should mention it-well, I read it so I guess I can mention there was some talk about an ice pack applied to the perineum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My sense of that was that even though the ice pack could have been wrapped in gauze and therefore, could have held the virus in it, it was more consistent with what we know about herpes transmission, that it was the hand of the nurse applying the ice pack rather than the ice pack that would have been the likelier source of transmission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Dr. Kahn was then asked:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having considered all of the potential sources of infection, did you arrive at one that was most likely in your mind?</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>His answer was:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think the likeliest explanation is the patient who had vaginal lesions with a second crop on the left labia, I believe, and was taken care of at one point by a health care giver who very shortly thereafter took care of Kim [plaintiff].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Kahn identified the patient as J.D. He then testified that, in light of the fact that the hospital records showed that J.D. had left labial lesions that had not been cultured it was imprudent to take her off herpes infection precautions.  He testified:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probability or the possibility of her having transmission-transmissible viruses was very high based on her history and her presentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination Dr. Kahn was asked, \"Is the best you can say is that J.D. is a possible source of the herpes infection in this case?\"  Then came the following exchange:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.  Comparing her to the other patient, I'd say very possible.  But again, I can't say probable or with definite certainty.  But a very credible likelihood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>Q. So the best you can say is possible, but you cannot say probable, correct?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>A. Slightly high on the possible but not probable. \"Probable\" meaning certainty, high possible meaning that's my choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To our knowledge, no New Hampshire case requires the incantation of the word \"probable\" to establish probable causation.

According to Nurse Watkins, when plaintiff's husband spoke to her he had three specific concerns:  the use of ice packs, lack of cleanliness generally in the hospital, and the dirty bathtub.  Nurse Watkins said she would look into it.  She denied that the husband asked her \"to inquire into a few things.\"  She never informed the husband about anything bearing on the source of plaintiff's infection.  Nor did she tell him that she would make an investigation for the hospital.  Most of the direct examination of Nurse Watkins by plaintiff's counsel focussed on the infection control procedures used at the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nurse Watkins was also asked questions about entries in the plaintiff's hospital records by the doctors and nurses who treated her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination Nurse Watkins gave the following testimony:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>Q. Given your job as  [sic] the hospital, as nurse epidemiologist, what do you generally do when a, a question of a hospital-acquired infection is brought to you?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>A. Well, it's my job to look into the circumstances of the infection, with the primary being a focus to identify practices which could be improved to decrease the risk of similar infections in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also had the responsibility for educating hospital personnel about infection risk and transmission again so that their practice will decrease the risk of transmission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>Q. Now, did you take those steps when Mr. F. came to you and suggested the problems he did?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>A. Certainly I looked into the situation, yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>Q. What did you conclude?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was an objection by plaintiff's counsel to the last question which was upheld on the ground that it was precluded by N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. ch. 151:13-a (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we discuss the scope of the New Hampshire statute we also must point out another serious omission in the record.  Defense counsel made no objection to any of the questions pertinent to this issue asked by plaintiff's counsel.  This was a waiver of the issue under Fed.  R. Evid. 103(a)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Nor is this omission cured because defendants had filed a motion in limine at the start of trial.  Objections to questions must be made when the questions are asked.  We also point out that there was not even a general objection to the line of questioning, although we do not suggest that this would have been sufficient to preserve defendants' rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent provision of the New Hampshire statute provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>II.  Records of a hospital committee organized to evaluate matters relating to the care and treatment of patients or to reduce morbidity and mortality and testimony by hospital trustees, medical staff, employees, or other committee attendees relating to activities of the quality assurance committee shall be confidential and privileged and shall be protected from direct or indirect means of discovery, subpoena, or admission into evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding, except that in the case of a legal action brought by a quality assurance committee to revoke or restrict a physician's license or hospital staff privileges, or in a proceeding alleging repetitive malicious action and personal injury brought against a physician, a committee's records shall be discoverable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. ch. 151:13-a II.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court carefully delineated the scope of the statute in a case that was the opening chapter to the case before us.  The parties were the same;  the issue concerned only the scope of the statute.  Justice Souter, then an associate justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, wrote the opinion, In re \"K\", <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1063</span></span> (N.H. 1989).  In the state case the evidence was clear that Nurse Watkins made an investigation as to the source of plaintiff's infection, then made a report to the Infections Committee and prepared a written report which was kept in files in her own office.  Plaintiff's lawyer requested the hospital, through Nurse Watkins, to release the results of the investigation.  The hospital refused, claiming a privilege under N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann. 151:13-a.  Plaintiff then brought a petition in the New Hampshire Superior Court seeking a disclosure order.  The superior court held the privilege inapplicable and ordered disclosure of Nurse Watkins' written report and the relevant portion of the minutes of the meeting of the Infections Committee at which Nurse Watkins made her report.  The hospital appealed.   Id. at 1065.  After a lengthy explanation and discussion of the legislation, the New Hampshire Supreme Court held that the minutes of the Infection Committee meeting and Nurse Watkins' written report were insulated from disclosure by the New Hampshire statute.   Id. at 1065.  The court also held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>Once, however, it is understood that the requisite committee structure and quality review function are present, our traditionally limiting approach to privilege claims must be honored by recognizing that the privilege does not go beyond the records of testimony, as such, to which the statute refers.  As we observed before, a quality assurance committee's attention does not place its subject matter beyond the bounds of discovery or disclosure  in the normal course;  the privilege is confined to the records and testimony described in the statute.  See N.H.S. Jour. 1410-14 (1981).  Thus, the ordinary record of a patient's treatment remains admissible as it always has been, even though a quality assurance committee may have studied that record and issued a report based on data culled from it.  And a physician may still be obligated to testify about the course of a patient's case, and to render a professional evaluation of the treatment, even though a quality assurance committee may already have elicited the same testimony on the same subject in the course of its own proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1070.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no difficulty finding that the New Hampshire statute was not implicated by the direct examination of Nurse Watkins in the case at bar.  It was arguably implicated by defendants' cross-examination, but that is not an issue before us.  It is incredible to us that defendants would misstate in their argument the questions asked and the testimony given, fail to object at trial to questions and answers which they now claim led to a violation of the statute, deliberately implicate the statute on cross-examination, and still appeal the issue.  This not only transcends the proper limit of appellate argument, it requires a good measure of \"chutzpa.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>THE CLOSING ARGUMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of his argument, plaintiff's counsel stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I gave a figure to you in the opening, that I would suggest that you seriously consider as a full, fair, adequate and reasonable compensation for what they have suffered, what they are suffering and what they will suffer.  And as I promised you then, I will say it again now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think I would suggest to you-not I think.  What I think doesn't count.  I would suggest to you that on the evidence, one million five hundred thousand dollars for Kimberly and one million five hundred thousand dollars for John is adequate, fair, full and complete compensation for their interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In  Davis v. Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538481\"><a href=\"/opinion/538481/kevin-davis-v-browning-ferris-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1990), we held that, even in a diversity case, the question of whether the amount of the ad damnum can be disclosed to the jury is a matter of procedure and therefore federal law applies.   Id. at 837.  We went on to hold that such disclosure was improper.   Id. at 837-38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inexplicably, both parties addressed the question below as exclusively one of New Hampshire law and, unfortunately, persuaded the district judge, a visiting judge from Pennsylvania, that New Hampshire law controlled.  Just prior to final argument defense counsel asked the court that it preclude plaintiff's counsel from expressing his opinion about the dollar value of the case or referring to the ad damnum in his argument.  Plaintiff's counsel had, without objection, stated the amount of the ad damnum in his opening.  The court therefore asked:  \"You mean it's all right on opening statement but not on closing?\"  Defense counsel stated: \"If I knew he was going to say it on opening, I would have objected but rather than my saying anything and object and make a bigger deal about it, I made the judgment not to.\"  The judge stated, after plaintiff's counsel argued that under New Hampshire law reference to the ad damnum was allowed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Coming from the Common-wealth of Pennsylvania my ears stood straight up when I heard you mention the figures in your opening statement, but hearing no objection I assumed that probably was the practice in this jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then asked plaintiff's counsel to supply him with authority for his position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's observation illustrates why counsel should object at the time an incorrect statement is made by opposing counsel.  If an objection had been made to the ad damnum disclosure in the opening, there would have been time for some research by the court and counsel prior to closing argument, and it probably would have been ascertained that there was a First Circuit case that clearly controlled.  As it was, the court did not make a ruling until after defendants' argument.  It ruled that under New Hampshire law the ad damnum could be disclosed to the jury in final argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are faced, therefore, with a ruling based on the wrong law.  This was due primarily to the neglect of both counsel.  We would think that counsel would be aware of the controlling First Circuit cases by the time of trial.  That plain error was committed is clear, but it is also clear that the error was harmless.  The ad damnum was in the amount of one million five hundred dollars for each plaintiff.  The jury awarded plaintiff one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars and her husband twenty-five thousand dollars.  Clearly, the jury paid scant attention to the amount of the ad damnum.  Under the circumstances, there is no point in sending the case back for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment below is affirmed.
