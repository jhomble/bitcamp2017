This appeal  arises out  of an\n          SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\n                               \n\naction brought  against the United  States by family  members and\n\npersonal representatives  of an  injured minor under  the Federal\n\nTort  Claims Act (FTCA), 28  U.S.C.    1346(b), 2671-2680 (1990).\n\nLong  after the  district  court dismissed  the case,  plaintiffs\n\nsought to revivify it but failed.   Believing, as we do, that the\n\ndistrict court appropriately rebuffed the attempted resurrection,\n\nwe affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          The  incident  that  sparked  this   case  occurred  on\n\nDecember  13, 1987, when a small child, Alexis Agosto, caught his\n\nhand  in a conveyer  belt operated by  an employee of  the United\n\nStates Department of  Agriculture (DOA).   On February 24,  1989,\n\nAgosto's parents  and grandparents filed FTCA  claims on Agosto's\n\nand their own  behalf.   On April 21,  DOA responded,  requesting\n\nmedical records,  itemized bills, and other  details.  Plaintiffs\n\nretained  counsel.  On November 29, 1989, their attorney notified\n\nDOA  that he  would  supply pictures  of  Agosto's injured  hand,\n\napparently  believing that  the  photographs would  satisfy DOA's\n\ncuriosity  anent  the extent  of  injury.   He  was wrong.   DOA,\n\nunmollified, wrote  to the lawyer  on March 5,  1990, reiterating\n\nits need for the  information previously requested and mentioning\n\nthat  plaintiffs' claim forms  were incomplete.   The letter also\n\nstated:\n\n          Please bear  in mind that the  claims must be\n          substantiated  and  that  we  must  have  the\n          information requested  before a determination\n          can  be made  by [the  appropriate official].\n\n                                2\n\n          No \n             \n\n          further action will be  taken on these claims\n                                                       \n          until  the  information  requested  has  been\n                                                       \n          received (emphasis in original).\n                  \n\nInstead  of  submitting further  particulars,  plaintiffs brought\n\nsuit.  They alleged, inter alia, that \"[n]o affirmative action as\n                               \n\nto any  settlement or  responsibility has  been  taken by  [DOA],\n\nalthough a copy of the  medical record has been provided  to them\n\n[sic].\"   This allegation was seemingly an endeavor to show that,\n\ndespite the lack of an explicit denial, DOA had implicitly denied\n\nplaintiffs'   claim,  thus   satisfying  the   FTCA's  exhaustion\n\nrequirement.  See 28 U.S.C.   2675(a).\n                 \n\n          The government answered  the complaint, asserting inter\n                                                                 \n\nalia  that plaintiffs had yet  to file a substantiated, completed\n    \n\nadministrative  claim, and,  therefore, had  not  exhausted their\n\nadministrative remedy.   On August  27, 1990, a  magistrate judge\n\nstayed proceedings for  ninety days to  allow plaintiffs a  final\n\nopportunity  \"to  provide defendant's  claim specialist  with the\n\nnecessary documentation  so that  defendant may either  accept or\n\nreject  the claim.\"  The  stay proved unproductive.   On November\n\n28, 1990, the magistrate  convened the next scheduled conference,\n\nnoted plaintiffs' counsel's absence, and reported to the district\n\njudge  that  \"the government  will  shortly move  to  dismiss the\n\ncomplaint for  failure to  exhaust administrative remedy.\"   Even\n\nso, some settlement negotiations continued.\n\n          To make a tedious tale tolerably terse, the government,\n\nprodded by the  district judge,  moved for dismissal  on May  15,\n\n                                3\n\n1991.   The motion papers  averred that plaintiffs  had failed to\n\nprosecute their claims diligently at either the administrative or\n\njudicial levels.   Among  other things, the  government proffered\n\nthe affidavit  of a  local DOA  staffer attesting to  plaintiffs'\n\nfailure to perfect their  administrative claims.  Without waiting\n\nfor plaintiffs' objection, the  district court dismissed the case\n\nwith prejudice  under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).  Judgment entered on\n\nMay 28, 1991.1\n\n          At   that   point,   plaintiffs   and   their   lawyer,\n\nfiguratively speaking, played the ostrich, burying their heads in\n\nthe sand and  ignoring the adverse  judgment.   They did not  ask\n\nthat the dismissal be vacated so that their opposition, see supra\n                                                                 \n\nnote 1, might  be more  fully considered; they  did not move  for\n\nreconsideration of the order;  they did not take an  appeal; they\n\ndid not seasonably seek post-judgment relief.  Withal, plaintiffs\n\nsuggest that  they continued  to pursue  negotiations, eventually\n\nreaching  what  plaintiffs'  counsel  describes  as  a  tentative\n\nagreement (ironically,  with the same DOA  representative who had\n\nexecuted the aforementioned affidavit) for a $60,000  settlement.\n\nThey concede,  however, that the United  States Attorney's office\n\ndeclined  to  approve  any  settlement,  presumably  because  the\n\nlawsuit had been  dismissed with prejudice.2   They also  concede\n\n                    \n\n     1Plaintiffs filed an opposition  to the dismissal motion one\nday after the judge granted the government's motion but five days\nbefore final judgment entered.\n\n     2It  is transparently  clear  that the  DOA  staffer had  no\nauthority  to  settle  the  claim  without  the  approval  of  an\nappropriate   Justice  Department   official  or,   perhaps,  the\n\n                                4\n\nthat  they never asked the district court to enforce the supposed\n\nsettlement.  Rather, plaintiffs  resumed their struthionine pose.\n\nIt was not  until September 28, 1992   sixteen  months to the day\n\nafter judgment entered    that they filed a motion  under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b)(6).3   The  court below denied  the motion  without\n\nfanfare.  This appeal followed.\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\n\n          District  courts  enjoy   considerable  discretion   in\n\ndeciding  motions brought under Civil Rule 60(b).  We review such\n\nrulings only for abuse  of that wide discretion.   See Teamsters,\n                                                                 \n\nChauffeurs,  Warehousemen  &amp;  Helpers  Union,  Local  No.  59  v.\n                                                             \n\nSuperline  Transp.  Co.,  953  F.2d  17,  19  (1st   Cir.  1992);\n                       \n\nRodriguez-Antuna v.  Chase Manhattan  Bank Corp.,  871 F.2d 1,  3\n                                                \n\n(1st  Cir. 1989); Ojeda-Toro  v. Rivera-Mendez,  853 F.2d  25, 28\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir. 1988).  \n\n          In  this case,  plaintiffs'  theory seems  to be  that,\n\nbecause   DOA's  representative  continued   to  negotiate  after\n\njudgment entered, the lower court should have excused plaintiffs'\n\nfailure  to  appeal or  otherwise  contest the  dismissal.   This\n\n                    \n\nSecretary of Agriculture.   See 28 U.S.C.   2672  (providing that\n                               \nFTCA settlements in excess  of $25,000 may only be  effected with\nthe  prior  written approval  of  the  Attorney  General  or  his\ndesignee; providing  further that, apart  from Justice Department\npersonnel,  only  \"the  head of  the  agency\"  may  serve as  the\nAttorney General's delegee).\n\n     3Plaintiffs' motion for relief  from judgment mentioned  the\nnegotiations, but  contained  no substantiation  for the  claimed\nsettlement:   no confirmatory  correspondence, no  affidavit from\nthe DOA official who  allegedly participated in the negotiations,\nno affidavit from plaintiffs' lawyer.\n\n                                5\n\ncontention  has a variety of flaws.  Without endeavoring to cover\n\nthe waterfront, we  offer four reasons why  plaintiffs' theory is\n\nunavailing.  In the course  of that recital, we assume the  truth\n\nof the fact-specific statements contained in  plaintiffs' motion,\n\nbut do not credit \"bald assertions, unsubstantiated  conclusions,\n\nperiphrastic   circum-locutions,   or  hyperbolic   rodomontade.\"\n\nSuperline, 953 F.2d at 18.\n         \n\n          First:  Rule  60(b) seeks to balance the  importance of\n          First:\n               \n\nfinality against  the desirability  of resolving disputes  on the\n\nmerits.   See  id. at  19.   The  rule's  first five  subsections\n                 \n\ndelineate  specific grounds  for relief.4   In  keeping with  the\n\n                    \n\n     4The rule states:\n\n          On  motion and upon such  terms as are  just, the court\n          may relieve  a party or a  party's legal representative\n          from  a final  judgment, order,  or proceeding  for the\n          following reasons:\n\n          (1)   mistake,  inadvertence,   surprise,  or\n          excusable neglect;\n          (2)  newly discovered  evidence which  by due\n          diligence could not  have been discovered  in\n          time  to  move for  a  new  trial under  Rule\n          59(b);\n          (3)  fraud  (whether  heretofore  denominated\n          intrinsic  or extrinsic),  misrepresentation,\n          or other misconduct of an adverse party;\n          (4) the judgment is void;\n          (5)   the   judgment   has  been   satisfied,\n          released, or discharged, or a  prior judgment\n          upon which  it is based has  been reversed or\n          otherwise  vacated,   or  it  is   no  longer\n          equitable  that  the  judgment   should  have\n          prospective application, or\n          (6) any  other reason justifying  relief from\n          the operation of the judgment.\n\n          The motion shall be made within a reasonable  time, and\n          for  reasons (1), (2), and  (3) not more  than one year\n          after the  judgment order or proceeding  was entered or\n\n                                6\n\npolicy  that  \"there  must  be  an  end  to  litigation someday,\"\n\nAckermann  v. United States, 340  U.S. 193, 198  (1950), the rule\n                           \n\nimposes a one-year limit on motions that invoke  clauses (1)-(3).\n\nWhile this limit does not apply in haec  verba to clause (6)   as\n                                              \n\nthe rule states, motions invoking  clauses (4)-(6) must only  \"be\n\nmade within  a reasonable time\"    clause  (6) is  designed as  a\n\ncatchall, and a motion  thereunder is only appropriate  when none\n\nof the first five  subsections pertain.  See Liljeberg  v. Health\n                                                                 \n\nServs.  Acquisition  Corp., 486  U.S.  847,  863 &amp;  n.11  (1988);\n                          \n\nKlapprott v.

The  essence of plaintiffs'  argument is that,\n\nunder  all  the  circumstances,  their  failure  to  contest  the\n\ndismissal constituted understandable,  ergo, excusable,  neglect.\n\nOn  its face, that theory falls squarely within the encincture of\n\nRule 60(b)(1) and,  as such, plaintiffs' motion,  filed more than\n\none  year  after the  entry of  judgment,  was time-barred.   See\n                                                                 \n\nPioneer Inv. Servs.  Co. v.  Brunswick Assoc., 113  S.

See  Ackermann,  340 U.S.  at  197-200;\n                                        \n\nMitchell v.

In our  adversary  system  of  justice, each  litigant\n\nremains under an  abiding duty to  take the legal steps  that are\n\nnecessary  to protect his or  her own interests.   See Ackermann,\n                                                                \n\n340 U.S. at 197.  Thus, Rule 60(b)(6) may  not be used as a back-\n\ndoor substitute for  an omitted appeal, and, in  all but the most\n\nexceptional circumstances,  a  party's  neglect  to  prosecute  a\n\ntimeous  appeal will bar relief  under the rule.   See Ackermann,\n                                                                \n\n340  U.S. at 197-202; Mitchell, 951 F.2d at 420; United States v.\n                                                              \n\nParcel  of Land, Etc.

To  be  sure, plaintiffs  strive  to show  the  contrary.\n\nCiting United States v. Baus, 834 F.2d 1114 (1st Cir. 1987), they\n                            \n\nargue that DOA acted  in a Svengali-like manner, lulling  them to\n\nsleep with settlement songs  while the sands of time  drained and\n\nthe appeal period expired.   This deception, they say,  justifies\n\nrelief  under Rule 60(b)(6).   The district court  did not agree.\n\nNor do we.  \n\n          Baus is  readily  distinguishable.   There,  defendants\n              \n\n                                8\n\n(the guarantors of  a debt owed to a  federal agency) moved, long\n\nafter the fact, for  relief from a judgment entered pursuant to a\n\nsettlement agreement they had  made with the United States.

We determined that the government had been dilatory\n\nin performing its side  of the bargain and had  probably breached\n\nits obligations  under the settlement agreement.  Id. at 1124-25.\n                                                     \n\nWe also noted  that three Assistant  United States Attorneys  had\n\nassured the  defendants that a further  judicial determination of\n\nindebtedness was necessary before the United States could collect\n\non  the guarantees,  and  that  the  defendants relied  on  these\n\nassurances.5    Id. at  1117.  In  such straitened circumstances,\n                   \n\nwe  ruled  that the  government, by  virtue  of a  combination of\n\ndilatory  practices,  disregard of  contractual  obligations, and\n\nrepeated  assurances, had so  muddied the  waters that  it \"would\n\nresult  in  manifest  unfairness   to  deny  relief\"  under  Rule\n\n60(b)(6).  Id. at 1123.  \n              \n\n          The  case at  bar  is  far  removed  from  Baus.    The\n                                                         \n\nplaintiffs' Rule  60(b)(6) motion  makes no  claim that,  but for\n\nsome   misleading   conduct  attributable   to   the  government,\n\nplaintiffs  would have  prosecuted  a timely  appeal.   There  is\n\n                    \n\n     5Furthermore,  the judgment  in Baus  entered pursuant  to a\n                                         \nstipulation; thus, the defendants had  no right of direct appeal.\nAfter all,  a party who  has agreed  to the entry  of a  judgment\nwithout any  reservation may  not  thereafter seek  to upset  the\njudgment, save for lack of actual consent or a failure of subject\nmatter jurisdiction.  See Dorse  v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc.,\n                                                                \n798 F.2d  1372, 1375 (11th Cir.  1986); 9 James W.  Moore et al.,\nMoore's  Federal Practice   203.06  (2d ed. 1993)  (\"A party that\n                         \nconsents to entry of  a judgment waives the right  to appeal from\nit.\"). \n\n                                9\n\nnothing in the present record to demonstrate that the  government\n\nstalled the  processing of the  claims, breached any  promise, or\n\notherwise acted in bad faith;  even in  this court, plaintiffs do\n\nnot  suggest that  the government  ever said  it would  waive the\n\nexhaustion requirement or overlook the judgment's legal  effect.6\n\nThere is, moreover, nothing to indicate any kind of impediment to\n\nplaintiffs' ability to protect their legal  interests in a timely\n\nmanner.     Unlike  in   Baus,  the  plaintiffs   instigated  the\n                             \n\nlitigation.  They knew the status of their claims at  all stages.\n\nThey could have appealed from the entry of judgment, but did not.\n\nAnd, finally, the plaintiffs  appreciated the significance of the\n\njudgment.7  \n\n          Because  plaintiffs  advance  neither   an  objectively\n\nreasonable  basis for not  challenging the  judgment in  a timely\n\nmanner nor evidence indicating a pattern of affirmative action on\n\nthe government's part which  would have led a  reasonably prudent\n\n                    \n\n     6The motion papers contain no allegation either that the DOA\nofficial who ostensibly conducted the negotiations knew about the\nentry  of judgment  or  that plaintiffs'  counsel discussed  that\nsubject with DOA personnel.\n\n     7It is beyond  peradventure that  plaintiffs recognized  the\nimport of the order dismissing the  case with prejudice.  It  was\nfor  this very reason that plaintiffs, in their opposition to the\nRule  41 motion, argued vociferously  that they should be allowed\nto  take  a  voluntary  dismissal without  prejudice  under  Rule\n41(a)(1) rather  than having their case  dismissed with prejudice\nunder  Rule 41(b).    In  support  of this  position,  plaintiffs\nclaimed  that  negotiations  were  ongoing   and  settlement  was\n\"imminent.\"    Given  these  contemporaneous  statements,  it  is\ndisingenuous   of  plaintiffs'  counsel   to  suggest   that  the\ncontinuation  of  settlement negotiations  led  him  to forgo  an\nappeal,  thinking   that  the   judgment  could  not   block  the\nrealization of a negotiated settlement. \n\n                                10\n\nperson to believe  that the dismissal  order was something  other\n\nthan it  was, Baus does not assist their cause.  Rather, we think\n                  \n\nthat plaintiffs' situation is much more akin to Ackermann.  After\n                                                         \n\nsuffering an adverse judgment in denaturalization proceedings and\n\nfailing  to prosecute  a timely  appeal, Ackermann  sought relief\n\nunder Rule  60(b)(6).  340  U.S. at  194-95.   He alleged,  inter\n                                                                 \n\nalia, that he relied  upon advice from a government  official who\n    \n\nassured him there was no need to appeal as he would ultimately be\n\nreleased.    See  id.  at  196.    In  affirming  the  denial  of\n                     \n\nAckermann's Rule 60(b)(6) motion, the Court stated:\n\n          It is  not  enough for  petitioner to  allege\n          that  he  had confidence  in  [the government\n          official]  .  .  .  [A]nything  said  by [the\n          government official]  could  not be  used  to\n          relieve  petitioner of his duty to take legal\n          steps to  protect his interest  in litigation\n          in  which  the  United  States  was  a  party\n          adverse to him.\n\nId.  at  197 (citations  omitted).    In language  which  appears\n   \n\npatently  pertinent to  the  pitiful predicament  of the  present\n\nplaintiffs, the Court concluded that, since Ackermann had made \"a\n\nconsidered choice not to  appeal,\" he \"cannot not be  relieved of\n\nsuch a choice because hindsight seems to indicate to him that his\n\ndecision  not  to  appeal  was probably  wrong,  considering  the\n\n[final] outcome.\"   Id. at  198.   So here.   Even if  plaintiffs\n                       \n\nreasonably believed  that DOA's representative  had authority  to\n\nnegotiate  a settlement,  this  belief in  no  way gave  them  an\n\nindeterminate carte blanche to  ignore the district judge's entry\n\nof  a final  judgment.    See,  e.g., Lubben,  453  F.2d  at  652\n                                            \n\n(suggesting that, so long as the  decision not to take an  appeal\n\n                                11\n\nwas one of unfettered choice and free will, courts should refrain\n\nfrom  speculating  on the  reasons why  a  laggard party  did not\n\nseasonably pursue an attack on an adverse judgment).  \n\n          We will not paint the lily.  \"[T]o justify relief under\n\nsubsection  (6), a  party  must show  extraordinary circumstances\n\nsuggesting that the party  is faultless in the delay.\"   Pioneer,\n                                                                \n\n113 S. Ct. at 1497.  The instant plaintiffs do  not qualify under\n\nso  rigorous a standard.   Their unilateral  assumption that they\n\ncould  negotiate  and  settle their  claims  notwithstanding  the\n\ncourt's decree falls woefully  short of establishing either their\n\nown  lack  of fault  or  the  kind of  exceptional  circumstances\n\nnecessary for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \n\n          Third:  Assuming, for argument's sake, that plaintiffs'\n          Third:\n               \n\nmotion  was  otherwise  within   the  rule's  purview,  it  would\n\nnevertheless fail on temporal grounds.  We explain briefly.\n\n          A  Rule   60(b)(6)  motion  \"must  be   made  within  a\n\nreasonable  time.\"     What   is  \"reasonable\"  depends   on  the\n\ncircumstances.   Cf., e.g., Sierra Club v. Secretary of the Army,\n                                                                \n\n820   F.2d   513,   517   (1st  Cir.   1987)   (explaining   that\n\n\"reasonableness is a mutable cloud, which is always and never the\n\nsame\")  (paraphrasing  Emerson).   Thus,  a  reasonable time  for\n\npurposes of Rule 60(b)(6)  may be more or less than  the one-year\n                                              \n\nperiod established  for filing  motions under  Rule 60(b)(1)-(3).\n\nSee  Planet Corp.  v. Sullivan,  702 F.2d  123, 125-26  (7th Cir.\n                              \n\n1983) (\"The  reasonableness requirement of Rule  60(b) applies to\n\nall  grounds; the  one  year limit  on  the first  three  grounds\n\n                                12\n\nenumerated merely specifies an outer boundary.\").\n\n          Here,  plaintiffs waited  sixteen months  before filing\n\ntheir  motion.  This  delay   overlong  in virtually  any event  \n\nmust  be  juxtaposed  in   this  case  against  plaintiffs'  bold\n\nassertion that the supposed  $60,000 settlement figure was agreed\n\nupon \"within two months of the entry of the  order of dismissal.\"\n\nAppellants'  Brief at 7.  If, as plaintiffs allege, they achieved\n\nso prompt  a meeting of the  minds, there is no  valid excuse for\n\nhaving dawdled an additional  fourteen months before alerting the\n\ndistrict  court to  the changed  circumstances.   Such protracted\n\ndelay scuttles any claim that plaintiffs' motion was \"made within\n\na  reasonable time.\"   See, e.g., Planet  Corp., 702 F.2d  at 126\n                                               \n\n(holding, on particular facts, that a six-month delay in making a\n\nRule   60(b)(6)  motion   was  unreasonably   dilatory);  Central\n                                                                 \n\nOperating Co.  v. Utility Workers  of America, AFL-CIO,  491 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n245, 253  (4th Cir. 1974)(similar; four-month  delay after notice\n\nof default judgment).  Having failed to move for  relief from the\n\njudgment  within  a  reasonable  time,  plaintiffs'   attempt  to\n\nbootstrap   the   alleged   settlement   agreement   onto   their\n\n\"exceptional circumstance\" argument is futile.\n\n          Fourth:   An  additional precondition  to  relief under\n          Fourth:\n                \n\nRule 60(b)(6) is that the movent make  a suitable showing that he\n\nor she has a  meritorious claim or  defense.  See Superline,  953\n                                                           \n\nF.2d  at 20;  Woburn City  Athletic  Club, 928  F.2d at  5.   The\n                                         \n\nplaintiffs stumble over  this hurdle.   Their  motion for  relief\n\nfrom judgment is utterly  silent on the exhaustion issue  and the\n\n                                13\n\nrecord is devoid  of any indication that they,  to this day, have\n\never complied with the  FTCA's administrative claim requirements.\n\nExhaustion   of   plaintiffs'   administrative  remedies   is   a\n\njurisdictional prerequisite  to  the prosecution  of  their  FTCA\n\nclaims.   See  28  U.S.C.    2675(a); see  also  Swift v.  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates,   614  F.2d   812,  814-15   (1st  Cir.  1980).     Thus,\n      \n\nnotwithstanding  plaintiffs'  assertion that  they  received some\n\nsettlement offer  from DOA,  the district court  was entitled  to\n\nconclude  \"that  vacating  the   judgment  [would]  be  an  empty\n\nexercise.\"  Superline, 953 F.2d at 20.\n                     \n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  are not  unsympathetic to  plaintiffs' plight.   It\n\nappears  that a young boy suffered severe injuries; that at least\n\none  federal   official  believes  the  boy's   claim  should  be\n\ncompensated; and  that, as  matters stand, plaintiffs  have quite\n\nlikely been victimized by a series of blunders on their lawyer's \n\npart (for which they may  have a claim against him).   But in our\n\nadversary  system,   the  acts  and  omissions   of  counsel  are\n\ncustomarily visited upon the  client in a civil case,  see, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nLink v. Wabash R.R.,  370 U.S. 626, 632-34 (1962);  United States\n                                                                 \n\nv.  $25,721, 938  F.2d 1417,  1422 (1st  Cir. 1991);  Woburn City\n                                                                 \n\nAthletic Club, 928  F.2d at 6; United  States v. 3,888 Pounds  of\n                                                                 \n\nAtlantic Sea Scallops, 857  F.2d 46, 49  (1st Cir. 1988), and  we\n                     \n\nsee  no legally  cognizable basis  for departing from  this well-\n\nestablished principle here.  On this poorly cultivated record, we\n\ncannot say  that  the district  court  abused its  discretion  in\n\n                                14\n\nrefusing to reopen the final judgment.  \n\n          We do  not believe, however, that  the lawyer's conduct\n\nshould go unremarked.  A judge has an  abiding obligation to take\n\nor  initiate appropriate disciplinary  measures against  a lawyer\n\nfor unprofessional conduct of which the judge becomes aware.  See\n                                                                 \n\nABA Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 3(D)(2) (1990).  We are of the\n                            \n\nopinion that plaintiffs' counsel's handling of this matter before\n\nthe  lower court raises  serious questions from  start to finish.\n\nWe  therefore direct  the district  judge to  review the  record,\n\nconduct such further inquiry as he may deem appropriate, and take\n\nor  initiate such  disciplinary action,  if any,  as is  meet and\n\nproper, the circumstances considered.  The clerk of  the district\n\ncourt shall also mail a copy of this opinion (translated into the\n\nSpanish language if the  district judge believes such translation\n\nwould  be   advisable)  to  each  of  the  plaintiffs,  at  their\n\nrespective home addresses.   See, e.g., Doyle v. Shubs,  905 F.2d\n                                                      \n\n1, 3 (1st Cir.1990) (per curiam).\n\nAffirmed.  Remanded to the district court, with instructions, for\n                                                                 \n\nconsideration of a collateral matter.\n                                    \n\n                                15\n",

Believing, as we do, that the\n\ndistrict court appropriately rebuffed the attempted resurrection,\n\nwe affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          The  incident  that  sparked  this   case  occurred  on\n\nDecember  13, 1987, when a small child, Alexis Agosto, caught his\n\nhand  in a conveyer  belt operated by  an employee of  the United\n\nStates Department of  Agriculture (DOA).   On February 24,  1989,\n\nAgosto's parents  and grandparents filed FTCA  claims on Agosto's\n\nand their own  behalf.   On April 21,  DOA responded,  requesting\n\nmedical records,  itemized bills, and other  details.  Plaintiffs\n\nretained  counsel.  On November 29, 1989, their attorney notified\n\nDOA  that he  would  supply pictures  of  Agosto's injured  hand,\n\napparently  believing that  the  photographs would  satisfy DOA's\n\ncuriosity  anent  the extent  of  injury.   He  was wrong.   DOA,\n\nunmollified, wrote  to the lawyer  on March 5,  1990, reiterating\n\nits need for the  information previously requested and mentioning\n\nthat  plaintiffs' claim forms  were incomplete.   The letter also\n\nstated:\n\n          Please bear  in mind that the  claims must be\n          substantiated  and  that  we  must  have  the\n          information requested  before a determination\n          can  be made  by [the  appropriate official].\n\n                                2\n\n          No \n             \n\n          further action will be  taken on these claims\n                                                       \n          until  the  information  requested  has  been\n                                                       \n          received (emphasis in original).\n                  \n\nInstead  of  submitting further  particulars,  plaintiffs brought\n\nsuit.  They alleged, inter alia, that \"[n]o affirmative action as\n                               \n\nto any  settlement or  responsibility has  been  taken by  [DOA],\n\nalthough a copy of the  medical record has been provided  to them\n\n[sic].\"   This allegation was seemingly an endeavor to show that,\n\ndespite the lack of an explicit denial, DOA had implicitly denied\n\nplaintiffs'   claim,  thus   satisfying  the   FTCA's  exhaustion\n\nrequirement.  See 28 U.S.C.   2675(a).\n                 \n\n          The government answered  the complaint, asserting inter\n                                                                 \n\nalia  that plaintiffs had yet  to file a substantiated, completed\n    \n\nadministrative  claim, and,  therefore, had  not  exhausted their\n\nadministrative remedy.   On August  27, 1990, a  magistrate judge\n\nstayed proceedings for  ninety days to  allow plaintiffs a  final\n\nopportunity  \"to  provide defendant's  claim specialist  with the\n\nnecessary documentation  so that  defendant may either  accept or\n\nreject  the claim.\"  The  stay proved unproductive.   On November\n\n28, 1990, the magistrate  convened the next scheduled conference,\n\nnoted plaintiffs' counsel's absence, and reported to the district\n\njudge  that  \"the government  will  shortly move  to  dismiss the\n\ncomplaint for  failure to  exhaust administrative remedy.\"   Even\n\nso, some settlement negotiations continued.\n\n          To make a tedious tale tolerably terse, the government,\n\nprodded by the  district judge,  moved for dismissal  on May  15,\n\n                                3\n\n1991.   The motion papers  averred that plaintiffs  had failed to\n\nprosecute their claims diligently at either the administrative or\n\njudicial levels.   Among  other things, the  government proffered\n\nthe affidavit  of a  local DOA  staffer attesting to  plaintiffs'\n\nfailure to perfect their  administrative claims.  Without waiting\n\nfor plaintiffs' objection, the  district court dismissed the case\n\nwith prejudice  under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).  Judgment entered on\n\nMay 28, 1991.1\n\n          At   that   point,   plaintiffs   and   their   lawyer,\n\nfiguratively speaking, played the ostrich, burying their heads in\n\nthe sand and  ignoring the adverse  judgment.   They did not  ask\n\nthat the dismissal be vacated so that their opposition, see supra\n                                                                 \n\nnote 1, might  be more  fully considered; they  did not move  for\n\nreconsideration of the order;  they did not take an  appeal; they\n\ndid not seasonably seek post-judgment relief.  Withal, plaintiffs\n\nsuggest that  they continued  to pursue  negotiations, eventually\n\nreaching  what  plaintiffs'  counsel  describes  as  a  tentative\n\nagreement (ironically,  with the same DOA  representative who had\n\nexecuted the aforementioned affidavit) for a $60,000  settlement.\n\nThey concede,  however, that the United  States Attorney's office\n\ndeclined  to  approve  any  settlement,  presumably  because  the\n\nlawsuit had been  dismissed with prejudice.2   They also  concede\n\n                    \n\n     1Plaintiffs filed an opposition  to the dismissal motion one\nday after the judge granted the government's motion but five days\nbefore final judgment entered.\n\n     2It  is transparently  clear  that the  DOA  staffer had  no\nauthority  to  settle  the  claim  without  the  approval  of  an\nappropriate   Justice  Department   official  or,   perhaps,  the\n\n                                4\n\nthat  they never asked the district court to enforce the supposed\n\nsettlement.  Rather, plaintiffs  resumed their struthionine pose.\n\nIt was not  until September 28, 1992   sixteen  months to the day\n\nafter judgment entered    that they filed a motion  under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b)(6).3   The  court below denied  the motion  without\n\nfanfare.  This appeal followed.\n\nII.

Moore et al.,\nMoore's  Federal Practice   203.06  (2d ed. 1993)  (\"A party that\n                         \nconsents to entry of  a judgment waives the right  to appeal from\nit.\"). \n\n                                9\n\nnothing in the present record to demonstrate that the  government\n\nstalled the  processing of the  claims, breached any  promise, or\n\notherwise acted in bad faith;  even in  this court, plaintiffs do\n\nnot  suggest that  the government  ever said  it would  waive the\n\nexhaustion requirement or overlook the judgment's legal  effect.6\n\nThere is, moreover, nothing to indicate any kind of impediment to\n\nplaintiffs' ability to protect their legal  interests in a timely\n\nmanner.     Unlike  in   Baus,  the  plaintiffs   instigated  the\n                             \n\nlitigation.  They knew the status of their claims at  all stages.\n\nThey could have appealed from the entry of judgment, but did not.\n\nAnd, finally, the plaintiffs  appreciated the significance of the\n\njudgment.7  \n\n          Because  plaintiffs  advance  neither   an  objectively\n\nreasonable  basis for not  challenging the  judgment in  a timely\n\nmanner nor evidence indicating a pattern of affirmative action on\n\nthe government's part which  would have led a  reasonably prudent\n\n                    \n\n     6The motion papers contain no allegation either that the DOA\nofficial who ostensibly conducted the negotiations knew about the\nentry  of judgment  or  that plaintiffs'  counsel discussed  that\nsubject with DOA personnel.\n\n     7It is beyond  peradventure that  plaintiffs recognized  the\nimport of the order dismissing the  case with prejudice.  It  was\nfor  this very reason that plaintiffs, in their opposition to the\nRule  41 motion, argued vociferously  that they should be allowed\nto  take  a  voluntary  dismissal without  prejudice  under  Rule\n41(a)(1) rather  than having their case  dismissed with prejudice\nunder  Rule 41(b).    In  support  of this  position,  plaintiffs\nclaimed  that  negotiations  were  ongoing   and  settlement  was\n\"imminent.\"    Given  these  contemporaneous  statements,  it  is\ndisingenuous   of  plaintiffs'  counsel   to  suggest   that  the\ncontinuation  of  settlement negotiations  led  him  to forgo  an\nappeal,  thinking   that  the   judgment  could  not   block  the\nrealization of a negotiated settlement. \n\n                                10\n\nperson to believe  that the dismissal  order was something  other\n\nthan it  was, Baus does not assist their cause.  Rather, we think\n                  \n\nthat plaintiffs' situation is much more akin to Ackermann.  After\n                                                         \n\nsuffering an adverse judgment in denaturalization proceedings and\n\nfailing  to prosecute  a timely  appeal, Ackermann  sought relief\n\nunder Rule  60(b)(6).  340  U.S. at  194-95.   He alleged,  inter\n                                                                 \n\nalia, that he relied  upon advice from a government  official who\n    \n\nassured him there was no need to appeal as he would ultimately be\n\nreleased.    See  id.  at  196.    In  affirming  the  denial  of\n                     \n\nAckermann's Rule 60(b)(6) motion, the Court stated:\n\n          It is  not  enough for  petitioner to  allege\n          that  he  had confidence  in  [the government\n          official]  .  .  .  [A]nything  said  by [the\n          government official]  could  not be  used  to\n          relieve  petitioner of his duty to take legal\n          steps to  protect his interest  in litigation\n          in  which  the  United  States  was  a  party\n          adverse to him.\n\nId.  at  197 (citations  omitted).    In language  which  appears\n   \n\npatently  pertinent to  the  pitiful predicament  of the  present\n\nplaintiffs, the Court concluded that, since Ackermann had made \"a\n\nconsidered choice not to  appeal,\" he \"cannot not be  relieved of\n\nsuch a choice because hindsight seems to indicate to him that his\n\ndecision  not  to  appeal  was probably  wrong,  considering  the\n\n[final] outcome.\"   Id. at  198.   So here.   Even if  plaintiffs\n                       \n\nreasonably believed  that DOA's representative  had authority  to\n\nnegotiate  a settlement,  this  belief in  no  way gave  them  an\n\nindeterminate carte blanche to  ignore the district judge's entry\n\nof  a final  judgment.    See,  e.g., Lubben,  453  F.2d  at  652\n                                            \n\n(suggesting that, so long as the  decision not to take an  appeal\n\n                                11\n\nwas one of unfettered choice and free will, courts should refrain\n\nfrom  speculating  on the  reasons why  a  laggard party  did not\n\nseasonably pursue an attack on an adverse judgment).  \n\n          We will not paint the lily.  \"[T]o justify relief under\n\nsubsection  (6), a  party  must show  extraordinary circumstances\n\nsuggesting that the party  is faultless in the delay.\"   Pioneer,\n                                                                \n\n113 S. Ct. at 1497.  The instant plaintiffs do  not qualify under\n\nso  rigorous a standard.   Their unilateral  assumption that they\n\ncould  negotiate  and  settle their  claims  notwithstanding  the\n\ncourt's decree falls woefully  short of establishing either their\n\nown  lack  of fault  or  the  kind of  exceptional  circumstances\n\nnecessary for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \n\n          Third:  Assuming, for argument's sake, that plaintiffs'\n          Third:\n               \n\nmotion  was  otherwise  within   the  rule's  purview,  it  would\n\nnevertheless fail on temporal grounds.  We explain briefly.\n\n          A  Rule   60(b)(6)  motion  \"must  be   made  within  a\n\nreasonable  time.\"     What   is  \"reasonable\"  depends   on  the\n\ncircumstances.   Cf., e.g., Sierra Club v. Secretary of the Army,\n                                                                \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489491\"><a href=\"/opinion/489491/sierra-club-v-secretary-of-the-army-sierra-club-v-secretary-of-the-army/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>   <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   517   (1st  Cir.   1987)   (explaining   that\n\n\"reasonableness is a mutable cloud, which is always and never the\n\nsame\")  (paraphrasing  Emerson).   Thus,  a  reasonable time  for\n\npurposes of Rule 60(b)(6)  may be more or less than  the one-year\n                                              \n\nperiod established  for filing  motions under  Rule 60(b)(1)-(3).\n\nSee  Planet Corp.  v.

This  delay   overlong  in virtually  any event  \n\nmust  be  juxtaposed  in   this  case  against  plaintiffs'  bold\n\nassertion that the supposed  $60,000 settlement figure was agreed\n\nupon \"within two months of the entry of the  order of dismissal.\"\n\nAppellants'  Brief at 7.  If, as plaintiffs allege, they achieved\n\nso prompt  a meeting of the  minds, there is no  valid excuse for\n\nhaving dawdled an additional  fourteen months before alerting the\n\ndistrict  court to  the changed  circumstances.   Such protracted\n\ndelay scuttles any claim that plaintiffs' motion was \"made within\n\na  reasonable time.\"   See, e.g., Planet  Corp., 702 F.2d  at 126\n                                               \n\n(holding, on particular facts, that a six-month delay in making a\n\nRule   60(b)(6)  motion   was  unreasonably   dilatory);  Central\n                                                                 \n\nOperating Co.  v.

Having failed to move for  relief from the\n\njudgment  within  a  reasonable  time,  plaintiffs'   attempt  to\n\nbootstrap   the   alleged   settlement   agreement   onto   their\n\n\"exceptional circumstance\" argument is futile.\n\n          Fourth:   An  additional precondition  to  relief under\n          Fourth:\n                \n\nRule 60(b)(6) is that the movent make  a suitable showing that he\n\nor she has a  meritorious claim or  defense.

The\n                                         \n\nplaintiffs stumble over  this hurdle.

See  28  U.S.C.    2675(a); see  also  Swift v.

Thus,\n      \n\nnotwithstanding  plaintiffs'  assertion that  they  received some\n\nsettlement offer  from DOA,  the district court  was entitled  to\n\nconclude  \"that  vacating  the   judgment  [would]  be  an  empty\n\nexercise.\"  Superline, 953 F.2d at 20.\n                     \n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We  are not  unsympathetic to  plaintiffs' plight.   It\n\nappears  that a young boy suffered severe injuries; that at least\n\none  federal   official  believes  the  boy's   claim  should  be\n\ncompensated; and  that, as  matters stand, plaintiffs  have quite\n\nlikely been victimized by a series of blunders on their lawyer's \n\npart (for which they may  have a claim against him).   But in our\n\nadversary  system,   the  acts  and  omissions   of  counsel  are\n\ncustomarily visited upon the  client in a civil case,  see, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nLink v.

On this poorly cultivated record, we\n\ncannot say  that  the district  court  abused its  discretion  in\n\n                                14\n\nrefusing to reopen the final judgment.  \n\n          We do  not believe, however, that  the lawyer's conduct\n\nshould go unremarked.  A judge has an  abiding obligation to take\n\nor  initiate appropriate disciplinary  measures against  a lawyer\n\nfor unprofessional conduct of which the judge becomes aware.
