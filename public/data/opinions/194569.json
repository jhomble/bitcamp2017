John  Pappalardo, United  States Attorney,  was on  brief for\n                     \nappellee.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          STAHL, Circuit Judge.   In  this appeal,  defendant\n                              \n\nBarry L.  Weinstein  challenges his  conviction  for  knowing\n\nreceipt of stolen property, and for conspiracy to commit that\n\ncrime.   Specifically,  defendant argues  that his  trial was\n\nunfairly  prejudiced   by  certain   comments  made  by   the\n\ngovernment  in  its closing  argument,  and  by the  district\n\ncourt's  charge  to  the  jury.    Finding  the  government's\n\ncomments  to be  harmless  error, and  the jury  instructions\n\nproper, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                      FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n                                        \n\n          The government's evidence in  this case shows  that\n\nin February of 1991, Michael Flatt, accompanied by a  friend,\n\nbroke into  a safe in  a private  home in Dallas,  Texas, and\n\nstole approximately 26 items of jewelry.  The purloined items\n\nhad a total resale value between $85,000 and $134,000.  Flatt\n\npackaged  the pieces and sent them via Federal Express to his\n\nhome in  Boston, Massachusetts.   Upon his return  to Boston,\n\nFlatt sought to have  some of the jewelry appraised.  He took\n\nthree examples of the loot to \"Roy K. Eyges, Inc.,\" a jewelry\n\nstore  in Boston,  where he  was introduced  to defendant,  a\n\njewelry appraiser employed at the store. \n\n          Flatt told  defendant  that he  had  inherited  the\n\njewelry  and that  he was interested  in selling it.   In the\n\nprivacy  of defendant's  office, defendant indicated  that he\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nwas interested in helping Flatt sell the jewelry, but that he\n\nwanted to do  so independently  of his employer,  so that  he\n\ncould  obtain  a  commission on  the  sale.    At this  first\n\nmeeting, defendant suggested that he and Flatt transact their\n\nbusiness in cash.   \n\n          The  following weekend,  defendant met  with Flatt,\n\nand was given several  pieces of the  jewelry to sell.   Some\n\ndays later, by arrangement,  the two met in a  public parking\n\ngarage,  where defendant  gave Flatt  a paper  bag containing\n\nbetween $7,000 and $9,000  in cash obtained from the  sale of\n\nunspecified pieces of the stolen jewelry.  \n\n          At this meeting, defendant  asked about the  source\n\nof the jewelry.   Flatt advised defendant that he  had stolen\n\nthe jewelry from Texas.  Defendant said that he had suspected\n\nthat the jewelry was stolen.   He also told Flatt that he had\n\nchecked to see if  the jewelry had been reported  stolen, and\n\nthat it had not been so reported.  \n\n          Several days later, again by arrangement, defendant\n\nand  Flatt met in defendant's  car on a  designated street in\n\nBoston.    Defendant  informed  Flatt that  defendant  and  a\n\npartner,  co-defendant  Eric  Bleiler,1  were  attempting  to\n\nraise  money in order to purchase some of the pieces outright\n\nfrom  Flatt.     At   that  meeting,  Flatt   gave  defendant\n\n                    \n\n1.  At trial,  Bleiler was  acquitted of all  charges against\nhim.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\napproximately  ten  additional pieces  of  stolen  jewelry to\n\nsell.\n\n          In  the course  of subsequent  phone conversations,\n\ndefendant told  Flatt that his partner Bleiler  had more cash\n\nfor  Flatt from  the sale  of some  of the jewelry,  and that\n\ndefendant could pick up the cash at Bleiler's shop in Newton,\n\nMassachusetts, outside  of Boston.   Flatt went  to Bleiler's\n\nshop  and  was given  a  paper  bag containing  approximately\n\n$9,000 in cash.  \n\n          Shortly after  his visit to  Bleiler's shop,  Flatt\n\nleft Boston  to live  in San Francisco.   Defendant  notified\n\nFlatt by  phone that  he was  interested in  doing additional\n\nbusiness with Flatt, and that he had $15,000 more in cash for\n\nFlatt  from  the sale  of  additional  pieces of  the  stolen\n\njewelry.  Flatt requested that defendant send him the cash in\n\nSan Francisco  via Federal  Express.  Before  receiving these\n\nlast proceeds from the sale  of the purloined jewelry,  Flatt\n\nwas arrested in San  Francisco in connection with the  Dallas\n\nburglary.2  After his arrest, Flatt  signed a written consent\n\nform allowing the San Francisco Police Department to open his\n\nmail.    On   April  24,  1991,  the   San  Francisco  Police\n\nintercepted  and opened  a  package addressed  to Flatt  from\n\ndefendant which contained $15,100 in cash.\n\n                    \n\n2.  In  separate proceedings,  Flatt was  convicted on  state\ncharges  of burglary  and  on federal  charges of  interstate\ntransportation of stolen property.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          Shortly  thereafter,  defendant  was  arrested  and\n\ncharged  with one count of knowing receipt of stolen property\n\nin  violation  of  18  U.S.C.     2315,3  and  one  count  of\n\nconspiracy to commit that  crime in violation of 18  U.S.C.  \n\n371.4  After  a five-day jury trial,  defendant was convicted\n\non  both  counts.    From these  convictions,  defendant  now\n\nappeals.  \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          On  appeal, defendant  argues  that certain  of the\n\ngovernment's  comments during closing  argument were unfairly\n\nprejudicial.   Defendant also  challenges one of  the court's\n\ninstructions  to the jury.  We address each argument in turn.\n\n                    \n\n3.  18 U.S.C.   2315 states in relevant part:\n\n     Whoever  receives,   possesses,  conceals,  stores,\n     barters, sells, or disposes of any goods, wares, or\n     merchandise, securities,  or money of  the value of\n     $5,000 or more . . . which have  crossed a State or\n     United   States   boundary   after  being   stolen,\n     unlawfully converted, or taken, knowing the same to\n     have been  stolen, unlawfully converted, or taken .\n     . .  [s]hall  be fined  not  more than  $10,000  or\n     imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\n\n4.  18 U.S.C.   371 states in relevant part:\n\n     If two or more persons conspire . . . to commit any\n     offense  against the United States . . . and one or\n     more  of  such persons  do  any act  to  effect the\n     object of  the conspiracy, each shall  be fined not\n     more than $10,000 or  imprisoned not more than five\n     years, or both. \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nA.  Government's Comments During Closing Argument\n                                                 \n\n          The  following  colloquy  took  place   during  the\n\ngovernment's closing argument:\n\n          Government:    [Defendants]  are not,  as\n          [defense  counsel] argued  to you  in his\n          opening,  sitting  the[re]  clothed in  a\n          mant[le] of innocence and I am asking you\n          --\n\n          The Court:  Oh, yes, they are.\n\n          Defendant's counsel:  Objection.\n\n          Co-defendant's counsel:  Objection.\n\n          The Court:  They  are indeed clothed in a\n          mant[le] of innocence.  They stand before\n          you  now -- sit before you now absolutely\n          and  totally  innocent.     They   remain\n          innocent until the government proves them\n          guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  \n\nDefendant  argues that  the  government's statement  had  the\n\neffect of denying him the presumption  of innocence, and that\n\nthe  comment was  sufficiently prejudicial  to warrant  a new\n\ntrial.  We disagree.\n\n          The prejudicial statements of a prosecutor at trial\n\nare subject to a  harmless error analysis.  United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nHasting,  461  U.S. 499,  507-509  (1983);  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nBrown, 938 F.2d 1482,  1489 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  112 S.\n                                                    \n\nCt.  611 (1991).  Convictions will therefore not be set aside\n\n\"for  small  errors  or defects  that  have  little,  if any,\n\nlikelihood  of  having changed  the  result  of the  trial.'\"\n\nHasting,  461 U.S. at 508 (quoting Chapman v. California, 386\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 18, 22 (1967)).  \n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          In  determining  whether  prosecutorial  misconduct\n\nrises  above the level  of harmless error,  \"`we consider the\n\nseverity  of the  misconduct,  whether it  was deliberate  or\n\naccidental,  the likely  effect of the  curative instruction,\n\nand  the strength  of  the  evidence  against  appellant[].'\"\n\nBrown,  938 F.2d at 1489  (quoting United States  v. Cox, 752\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 741, 745 (1st Cir. 1985)).  \n\n          Having carefully considered all of  the factors set\n\nforth in Brown, it is  our opinion that the likely effect  of\n              \n\nthe  district court's  strong,  correct  and  contemporaneous\n\ncurative  instruction, when  combined with the  court's final\n\ncharge,5 was that the jury  remained properly apprised of the\n\npresumption   of   innocence,   despite    the   government's\n\nimprovident  statement.    Accordingly,   we  rule  that  the\n\nprosecutor's comment, although  improper, was harmless error.\n\nSee, e.g., United States  v. Lilly, No. 91-2192, slip  op. at\n                                  \n\n                    \n\n5.  Along with its sua sponte correction, which literally cut\n                             \noff the  government in mid-sentence, the  district court also\ngave  the following  instruction in  its final charge  to the\njury: \n          Now,  we  have  talked  a lot  about  the\n          presumption of innocence.   It is a  rule\n          of law  in this country, indeed,  it is a\n          constitutional rule, that a  defendant is\n          presumed to be innocent.  And that means,\n          very   simply   that  the   defendant  is\n          innocent.    He  is  innocent  until  the\n          government  proves  him   guilty.     And\n          because he  is innocent, he does not have\n          to  prove  his  innocence.    He  has  no\n          obligation to offer  any evidence, he has\n          no obligation to  offer any  explanation,\n          hehas no obligation to take the stand.   \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n17  (1st  Cir. 1992)  (indicating  that  generally \"a  strong\n\nmessage from the bench, delivered promptly, is a satisfactory\n\nantidote to the potentially poisonous effects of an ambiguous\n\ncomment  or  a remark  that sails  too  close to  the wind\");\n\nUnited States v. Maccini,  721 F.2d 840, 847 (1st  Cir. 1983)\n                        \n\n(holding that district  court's \"strong curative instructions\n\nwere  sufficient  to  correct\"  the  effect  of  government's\n\nimproper statements).6\n\n                    \n\n6.  Defendant also challenges two implications allegedly made\nby the government during  its rebuttal to defendant's closing\nargument.   According to  defendant, the  government unfairly\nimplied that  the testimony  of law enforcement  officials is\ngenerally more credible than the testimony of laypersons, and\nthat  defendant's  actions had  violated  a Boston  ordinance\nwhich requires  that large  cash transactions be  reported to\nthe Boston Police.    \n     Even   if  the   government's  comments   carried  these\nimplications,  defendant  has  failed  to  argue,  let  alone\ndemonstrate, that either comment  \"`changed the result of the\ntrial.'\"  Hasting, 461 U.S. at 508 (quoting Chapman, 386 U.S.\n                                                   \nat 22).  As defendant himself concedes, the government's case\nagainst   him  consisted  primarily   of  Flatt's  testimony.\nNeither  police  credibility  nor the  Boston  ordinance were\nsignificant issues in the case against defendant.  \n     Moreover,   the   district   court  directly   addressed\ndefendant's concerns  regarding the statements.   With regard\nto the  testimony of  law enforcement officers,  the district\ncourt  told the  jury:   \"You should  judge [law  enforcement\nofficials] in exactly  the same  way as  you judge  everybody\nelse.  Just because  they work for a law  enforcement agency,\ndoesn't make  them more  believable nor less  believable than\nanybody  else.\"   With regard  to the  Boston  ordinance, the\ndistrict court instructed the jury that \"neither  [defendant]\nnor [co-defendant] Bleiler do business in Boston.   So, there\nis no  evidence one  way  or the  other  that they  have  any\nobligation  to   file  a  police  report.\"    We  find  these\ninstructions  more  than  adequate  to  dispel  any  possible\nprejudice  from  the  government's  statements.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                            \nLilly,  slip  op.  at   17  (strong  corrective  instructions\n     \ngenerally   sufficient   to   cure   improper   prosecutorial\ncomments).   To the extent, therefore,  that these statements\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nB.  Jury Instructions\n                     \n\n          Defendant  also  challenges   the  following   jury\n\ninstruction  regarding  the  process  of  evaluating  witness\n\ncredibility:\n\n          Now, th[e] process [of evaluating witness\n          credibility]   is,   as  used   here,  no\n          different from what you  do all the time,\n          every day in  your lives.   When somebody\n          tells you a  story, you  make a  judgment\n          whether  you believe what the person told\n          you.     You   probably   do  it   almost\n          instinctively.  And I ask you to make the\n          same judgment, precisely the same kind of\n          judgment, as you  review the testimony of\n          each of the witnesses.  \n\nRelying  on United States v. Araujo, 539 F.2d 287, 290-91 (2d\n                                   \n\nCir.), cert.  denied, 429 U.S. 983  (1976)), defendant argues\n                    \n\nthat this  instruction was  prejudicial because  it permitted\n\njurors to  rely improperly  on their \"instincts\"  rather than\n\ntheir common sense in assessing witness credibility.  We find\n\ndefendant's argument bordering on the frivolous.\n\n          The   district  court   in  Araujo,   referring  to\n                                            \n\nparticular  testimony or  evidence at  trial,  instructed the\n\njury  that  human  beings  have  a  tendency  or  a  \"natural\n\n                    \n\nwere improper, they too were harmless error.\n     Similarly,  we are  unpersuaded by  defendant's argument\nthat the  two comments had the cumulative effect of rendering\nthe  trial unfair.  Given that the comments were unrelated to\neach  other, and that each comment standing alone was at most\nharmless error, there simply is no basis for  concluding that\nthe  comments  taken  together  influenced  the  outcome   of\ndefendant's trial in any way.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\ninstinct\" to lie  when confronted  with an  accusation.   The\n\nSecond Circuit  disapproved of the comment,  stating that \"it\n\nwould be  preferable if the trial  judge avoided interjecting\n\nhis[/her]  own  personal  views  of  human  nature  into  the\n\ncharge.\"  Id. at 291.\n             \n\n          Plainly, the  instant case  is very  different from\n\nAraujo.   In using  the term  \"instinctively\" in the  instant\n      \n\ncase,  the district court, in  the context of  a complete and\n\ncorrect  jury instruction  on assessing  witness credibility,\n\nmerely emphasized to jury members that their every-day manner\n\nof  assessing credibility  could  be employed  in their  jury\n\ndeliberations.   Far  from encouraging  jury members  to cast\n\naside their common sense, the instruction tended to encourage\n\nits use.   As such, the instruction does not  provide a basis\n\nfor granting defendant a new trial.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          For  the  foregoing reasons,  the  judgment of  the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed. \n                  \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n",

In  this appeal,  defendant\n                              \n\nBarry L.  Weinstein  challenges his  conviction  for  knowing\n\nreceipt of stolen property, and for conspiracy to commit that\n\ncrime.   Specifically,  defendant argues  that his  trial was\n\nunfairly  prejudiced   by  certain   comments  made  by   the\n\ngovernment  in  its closing  argument,  and  by the  district\n\ncourt's  charge  to  the  jury.    Finding  the  government's\n\ncomments  to be  harmless  error, and  the jury  instructions\n\nproper, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                      FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n                                        \n\n          The government's evidence in  this case shows  that\n\nin February of 1991, Michael Flatt, accompanied by a  friend,\n\nbroke into  a safe in  a private  home in Dallas,  Texas, and\n\nstole approximately 26 items of jewelry.  The purloined items\n\nhad a total resale value between $85,000 and $134,000.  Flatt\n\npackaged  the pieces and sent them via Federal Express to his\n\nhome in  Boston, Massachusetts.   Upon his return  to Boston,\n\nFlatt sought to have  some of the jewelry appraised.  He took\n\nthree examples of the loot to \"Roy K. Eyges, Inc.,\" a jewelry\n\nstore  in Boston,  where he  was introduced  to defendant,  a\n\njewelry appraiser employed at the store. \n\n          Flatt told  defendant  that he  had  inherited  the\n\njewelry  and that  he was interested  in selling it.   In the\n\nprivacy  of defendant's  office, defendant indicated  that he\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nwas interested in helping Flatt sell the jewelry, but that he\n\nwanted to do  so independently  of his employer,  so that  he\n\ncould  obtain  a  commission on  the  sale.    At this  first\n\nmeeting, defendant suggested that he and Flatt transact their\n\nbusiness in cash.   \n\n          The  following weekend,  defendant met  with Flatt,\n\nand was given several  pieces of the  jewelry to sell.   Some\n\ndays later, by arrangement,  the two met in a  public parking\n\ngarage,  where defendant  gave Flatt  a paper  bag containing\n\nbetween $7,000 and $9,000  in cash obtained from the  sale of\n\nunspecified pieces of the stolen jewelry.  \n\n          At this meeting, defendant  asked about the  source\n\nof the jewelry.   Flatt advised defendant that he  had stolen\n\nthe jewelry from Texas.  Defendant said that he had suspected\n\nthat the jewelry was stolen.   He also told Flatt that he had\n\nchecked to see if  the jewelry had been reported  stolen, and\n\nthat it had not been so reported.  \n\n          Several days later, again by arrangement, defendant\n\nand  Flatt met in defendant's  car on a  designated street in\n\nBoston.    Defendant  informed  Flatt that  defendant  and  a\n\npartner,  co-defendant  Eric  Bleiler,1  were  attempting  to\n\nraise  money in order to purchase some of the pieces outright\n\nfrom  Flatt.     At   that  meeting,  Flatt   gave  defendant\n\n                    \n\n1.  At trial,  Bleiler was  acquitted of all  charges against\nhim.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\napproximately  ten  additional pieces  of  stolen  jewelry to\n\nsell.\n\n          In  the course  of subsequent  phone conversations,\n\ndefendant told  Flatt that his partner Bleiler  had more cash\n\nfor  Flatt from  the sale  of some  of the jewelry,  and that\n\ndefendant could pick up the cash at Bleiler's shop in Newton,\n\nMassachusetts, outside  of Boston.   Flatt went  to Bleiler's\n\nshop  and  was given  a  paper  bag containing  approximately\n\n$9,000 in cash.  \n\n          Shortly after  his visit to  Bleiler's shop,  Flatt\n\nleft Boston  to live  in San Francisco.   Defendant  notified\n\nFlatt by  phone that  he was  interested in  doing additional\n\nbusiness with Flatt, and that he had $15,000 more in cash for\n\nFlatt  from  the sale  of  additional  pieces of  the  stolen\n\njewelry.  Flatt requested that defendant send him the cash in\n\nSan Francisco  via Federal  Express.  Before  receiving these\n\nlast proceeds from the sale  of the purloined jewelry,  Flatt\n\nwas arrested in San  Francisco in connection with the  Dallas\n\nburglary.2  After his arrest, Flatt  signed a written consent\n\nform allowing the San Francisco Police Department to open his\n\nmail.    On   April  24,  1991,  the   San  Francisco  Police\n\nintercepted  and opened  a  package addressed  to Flatt  from\n\ndefendant which contained $15,100 in cash.\n\n                    \n\n2.  In  separate proceedings,  Flatt was  convicted on  state\ncharges  of burglary  and  on federal  charges of  interstate\ntransportation of stolen property.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\n          Shortly  thereafter,  defendant  was  arrested  and\n\ncharged  with one count of knowing receipt of stolen property\n\nin  violation  of  18  U.S.C.     2315,3  and  one  count  of\n\nconspiracy to commit that  crime in violation of 18  U.S.C.  \n\n371.4  After  a five-day jury trial,  defendant was convicted\n\non  both  counts.    From these  convictions,  defendant  now\n\nappeals.  \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          On  appeal, defendant  argues  that certain  of the\n\ngovernment's  comments during closing  argument were unfairly\n\nprejudicial.   Defendant also  challenges one of  the court's\n\ninstructions  to the jury.  We address each argument in turn.\n\n                    \n\n3.  18 U.S.C.   2315 states in relevant part:\n\n     Whoever  receives,   possesses,  conceals,  stores,\n     barters, sells, or disposes of any goods, wares, or\n     merchandise, securities,  or money of  the value of\n     $5,000 or more . . . which have  crossed a State or\n     United   States   boundary   after  being   stolen,\n     unlawfully converted, or taken, knowing the same to\n     have been  stolen, unlawfully converted, or taken .\n     . .  [s]hall  be fined  not  more than  $10,000  or\n     imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\n\n4.  18 U.S.C.   371 states in relevant part:\n\n     If two or more persons conspire . . . to commit any\n     offense  against the United States . . . and one or\n     more  of  such persons  do  any act  to  effect the\n     object of  the conspiracy, each shall  be fined not\n     more than $10,000 or  imprisoned not more than five\n     years, or both. \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nA.  Government's Comments During Closing Argument\n                                                 \n\n          The  following  colloquy  took  place   during  the\n\ngovernment's closing argument:\n\n          Government:    [Defendants]  are not,  as\n          [defense  counsel] argued  to you  in his\n          opening,  sitting  the[re]  clothed in  a\n          mant[le] of innocence and I am asking you\n          --\n\n          The Court:  Oh, yes, they are.\n\n          Defendant's counsel:  Objection.\n\n          Co-defendant's counsel:  Objection.\n\n          The Court:  They  are indeed clothed in a\n          mant[le] of innocence.  They stand before\n          you  now -- sit before you now absolutely\n          and  totally  innocent.     They   remain\n          innocent until the government proves them\n          guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  \n\nDefendant  argues that  the  government's statement  had  the\n\neffect of denying him the presumption  of innocence, and that\n\nthe  comment was  sufficiently prejudicial  to warrant  a new\n\ntrial.  We disagree.\n\n          The prejudicial statements of a prosecutor at trial\n\nare subject to a  harmless error analysis.

Accordingly,   we  rule  that  the\n\nprosecutor's comment, although  improper, was harmless error.\n\nSee, e.g., United States  v. Lilly, No. 91-2192, slip  op. at\n                                  \n\n                    \n\n5.  Along with its sua sponte correction, which literally cut\n                             \noff the  government in mid-sentence, the  district court also\ngave  the following  instruction in  its final charge  to the\njury: \n          Now,  we  have  talked  a lot  about  the\n          presumption of innocence.   It is a  rule\n          of law  in this country, indeed,  it is a\n          constitutional rule, that a  defendant is\n          presumed to be innocent.  And that means,\n          very   simply   that  the   defendant  is\n          innocent.    He  is  innocent  until  the\n          government  proves  him   guilty.     And\n          because he  is innocent, he does not have\n          to  prove  his  innocence.    He  has  no\n          obligation to offer  any evidence, he has\n          no obligation to  offer any  explanation,\n          hehas no obligation to take the stand.   \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n17  (1st  Cir. 1992)  (indicating  that  generally \"a  strong\n\nmessage from the bench, delivered promptly, is a satisfactory\n\nantidote to the potentially poisonous effects of an ambiguous\n\ncomment  or  a remark  that sails  too  close to  the wind\");\n\nUnited States v.

Defendant also challenges two implications allegedly made\nby the government during  its rebuttal to defendant's closing\nargument.   According to  defendant, the  government unfairly\nimplied that  the testimony  of law enforcement  officials is\ngenerally more credible than the testimony of laypersons, and\nthat  defendant's  actions had  violated  a Boston  ordinance\nwhich requires  that large  cash transactions be  reported to\nthe Boston Police.    \n     Even   if  the   government's  comments   carried  these\nimplications,  defendant  has  failed  to  argue,  let  alone\ndemonstrate, that either comment  \"`changed the result of the\ntrial.'\"  Hasting, 461 U.S. at 508 (quoting Chapman, 386 U.S.\n                                                   \nat 22).  As defendant himself concedes, the government's case\nagainst   him  consisted  primarily   of  Flatt's  testimony.\nNeither  police  credibility  nor the  Boston  ordinance were\nsignificant issues in the case against defendant.  \n     Moreover,   the   district   court  directly   addressed\ndefendant's concerns  regarding the statements.   With regard\nto the  testimony of  law enforcement officers,  the district\ncourt  told the  jury:   \"You should  judge [law  enforcement\nofficials] in exactly  the same  way as  you judge  everybody\nelse.  Just because  they work for a law  enforcement agency,\ndoesn't make  them more  believable nor less  believable than\nanybody  else.\"   With regard  to the  Boston  ordinance, the\ndistrict court instructed the jury that \"neither  [defendant]\nnor [co-defendant] Bleiler do business in Boston.   So, there\nis no  evidence one  way  or the  other  that they  have  any\nobligation  to   file  a  police  report.\"    We  find  these\ninstructions  more  than  adequate  to  dispel  any  possible\nprejudice  from  the  government's  statements.   See,  e.g.,\n                                                            \nLilly,  slip  op.  at   17  (strong  corrective  instructions\n     \ngenerally   sufficient   to   cure   improper   prosecutorial\ncomments).

When somebody\n          tells you a  story, you  make a  judgment\n          whether  you believe what the person told\n          you.     You   probably   do  it   almost\n          instinctively.  And I ask you to make the\n          same judgment, precisely the same kind of\n          judgment, as you  review the testimony of\n          each of the witnesses.  \n\nRelying  on United States v. Araujo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"337857\"><a href=\"/opinion/337857/united-states-v-jose-araujo/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 290-91 (2d\n                                   \n\nCir.), cert.  denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1976)), defendant argues\n                    \n\nthat this  instruction was  prejudicial because  it permitted\n\njurors to  rely improperly  on their \"instincts\"  rather than\n\ntheir common sense in assessing witness credibility.  We find\n\ndefendant's argument bordering on the frivolous.\n\n          The   district  court   in  Araujo,   referring  to\n                                            \n\nparticular  testimony or  evidence at  trial,  instructed the\n\njury  that  human  beings  have  a  tendency  or  a  \"natural\n\n                    \n\nwere improper, they too were harmless error.\n     Similarly,  we are  unpersuaded by  defendant's argument\nthat the  two comments had the cumulative effect of rendering\nthe  trial unfair.  Given that the comments were unrelated to\neach  other, and that each comment standing alone was at most\nharmless error, there simply is no basis for  concluding that\nthe  comments  taken  together  influenced  the  outcome   of\ndefendant's trial in any way.\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\ninstinct\" to lie  when confronted  with an  accusation.   The\n\nSecond Circuit  disapproved of the comment,  stating that \"it\n\nwould be  preferable if the trial  judge avoided interjecting\n\nhis[/her]  own  personal  views  of  human  nature  into  the\n\ncharge.\"  Id. at 291.\n             \n\n          Plainly, the  instant case  is very  different from\n\nAraujo.   In using  the term  \"instinctively\" in the  instant\n      \n\ncase,  the district court, in  the context of  a complete and\n\ncorrect  jury instruction  on assessing  witness credibility,\n\nmerely emphasized to jury members that their every-day manner\n\nof  assessing credibility  could  be employed  in their  jury\n\ndeliberations.   Far  from encouraging  jury members  to cast\n\naside their common sense, the instruction tended to encourage\n\nits use.   As such, the instruction does not  provide a basis\n\nfor granting defendant a new trial.\n\n                             III.\n                                 \n\n                          CONCLUSION\n                                    \n\n          For  the  foregoing reasons,  the  judgment of  the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed. \n                  \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n</pre>",
