Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Selya and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert A. O'Meara, by appointment of the Court, on brief for\nappellant.\n     Jeremy M. Sternberg, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Michael J.\nSullivan, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              June 11, 2008\n\f           STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.           Appellant Musa Karim, a\n\nKenyan national, challenges the sufficiency of the evidence upon\n\nwhich a jury found him guilty of conspiracy to commit marriage\n\nfraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.             Following a three-day\n\ntrial, Karim was convicted of conspiring to enter a fraudulent\n\nmarriage   with   a   United   States   citizen    in   order   to   reap   the\n\nimmigration benefits he anticipated receiving from such a union.\n\n           We review de novo an appeal contesting the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence to sustain a conviction.       See United States v. Moran,\n\n312 F.3d 480, 487 (1st Cir. 2002).           Such a challenge faces a\n\nsignificant hurdle in that we ask only whether a reasonable jury\n\ncould have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and we \"resolve\n\nall questions of credibility and reasonable inferences in favor of\n\nthe verdict.\"     United States v. Lizardo, 445 F.3d 73, 81 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 127 S.Ct. 524 (2006).          In this case, Karim's\n\nhurdle on appeal is particularly daunting given the considerable\n\nevidence of his guilt presented at trial.           Having concluded that\n\nthere was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury could\n\nhave found Karim guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, we affirm the\n\njudgment of conviction below.\n\n           To support a guilty verdict for conspiracy under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 371, the government must show beyond a reasonable doubt\n\n\"the existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's knowledge of it,\n\nand his voluntary participation in it.\"           United States v. Yefsky,\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f994 F.2d 885, 890 (1st Cir. 1993).       The government alleged that the\n\nobject of Karim's conspiracy was violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1325(c),\n\nwhich   imposes   criminal   sanctions    upon   \"[a]ny   individual   who\n\nknowingly enters into a marriage for the purpose of evading any\n\nprovision of the immigration laws.\"\n\n           On appeal, Karim puts forth three challenges to the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence presented at trial. He argues that the\n\ngovernment failed to prove (1) the existence of an agreement to\n\nviolate the immigration laws; (2) the commission of an overt act in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy; and (3) that the marriage was not\n\nfor a \"true purpose.\"     Having reviewed the evidence presented at\n\ntrial in the light most favorable to the verdict, we find these\n\narguments meritless.     Indeed, the evidence paints a picture of a\n\ntransparent attempt by Karim to conspire to evade the immigration\n\nlaws by marriage to a United States citizen.\n\n           Karim entered the United States from Kenya in 1999 on a\n\nstudent visa.     When his visa expired, Karim remained in the United\n\nStates without authorization.     On July 26, 2005, he was arrested\n\nand detained on immigration violations pending a removal hearing\n\nbefore an immigration judge.     In August 2005, Karim's sister, Ann\n\nKarim, with whom he lived, contacted Nicole Mann, a U.S. citizen\n\nwith whom Karim had recently ended a brief, eleven-day romantic\n\nrelationship.     Ann Karim told Mann of Karim's incarceration and\n\nMann agreed to visit him in jail, though the two were no longer\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fdating.   After the visit, Ann Karim called Mann and explained that\n\nbecause Karim was not a U.S. citizen, he faced deportation, and\n\nMann could help by saying she was his girlfriend or fiancee.    Mann\n\nvisited Karim again in jail soon thereafter, and Karim asked her\n\nwhether she was \"going to do that thing\" for him.    Following that\n\nvisit, Ann Karim again called Mann, and explained that Mann would\n\nhave to marry Karim in order to help him remain in the United\n\nStates.   Mann agreed to do so.\n\n           Initially, Mann and Ann Karim attempted to arrange a\n\nwedding ceremony at the jail where Karim was detained.         After\n\nlearning that those ceremonies only took place twice a year, and\n\nthe wait for the next opportunity was quite long, Karim suggested\n\nto his sister the possibility of a marriage by proxy, which could\n\nbe done more quickly.   After a few logistical setbacks, Ann Karim\n\narranged for Mann to fly to Texas in order to enter a marriage by\n\nproxy under Texas law with Musa Karim.   Ann Karim stood in for her\n\nbrother at the Texas marriage ceremony, having obtained a written\n\nproxy from him.    The day before Mann flew to Texas she visited\n\nKarim in jail.    He asked her, \"So you're definitely going to go\n\ntomorrow and do that thing for me, right?\"   Mann replied \"yes,\" and\n\ntestified at trial that she interpreted Karim's question to mean\n\n\"[t]he fake marriage.   I was going to do it.\"   Mann testified that\n\nshe never intended for Karim to be her real husband, and she and\n\nKarim did not see each other again until Karim's criminal trial.\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fKarim testified that he was aware of the immigration benefits of\n\nmarriage to a citizen of the United States, and, before the\n\nDistrict   Court,   he   asserted   his   eligibility   for   a   waiver   of\n\ndeportation based on his marriage to Mann.\n\n           In his brief to this court, Karim first argues that the\n\ngovernment did not prove that an agreement existed among the co-\n\nconspirators, but only that Ann Karim \"somehow assisted Musa\n\n[Karim] in arranging a true marriage to Nicole Mann.\"             However, a\n\njury could reasonably infer from the evidence that Karim, his\n\nsister, and Mann agreed to undertake a plan to prevent Karim's\n\ndeportation by arranging a fraudulent marriage.               Contrary to\n\nKarim's assertion, we do not require \"evidence of an explicit\n\nagreement to ground a conspiracy conviction,\" United States v.\n\nPesaturo, 476 F.3d 60, 72 (1st Cir. 2007), but instead honor the\n\n\"well-established legal principle that a conspiracy may be based on\n\na tacit agreement shown from an implicit working relationship,\"\n\nUnited States v. Patrick, 248 F.3d 11, 20 (1st Cir. 2001).            Here,\n\nthere was ample testimony pointing to a deliberate, coordinated\n\neffort among the Karim siblings and Nicole Mann to facilitate a\n\nfraudulent marriage for immigration purposes.\n\n           Karim also argues on appeal that the government failed to\n\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that any of the co-conspirators\n\ncommitted an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.                This\n\nargument is plainly without merit, given the numerous conversations\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fand logistical arrangements that took place among the parties,\n\nwhich culminated in a trip to Texas to create the marriage by\n\nproxy.\n\n          Finally, Karim argues that the government failed to show\n\nthat the marriage was not entered into \"for a true purpose.\"     He\n\nargues that though Mann testified that she viewed the marriage as\n\na fraud, that does not mean the government proved that Karim shared\n\nthis view.   Instead, Karim points to his testimony that \"it was\n\nalways his intent to make a life with Ms. Mann and her four year\n\nold child.\" Karim's challenge on this point raises the question of\n\nwhether conviction for conspiracy to commit marriage fraud requires\n\na showing that the couple did not intend to establish a life\n\ntogether, as was instructed by the District Court in this case, or\n\nsimply that the marriage was entered into in order to evade\n\nimmigration laws, which tracks the language of the statute.    See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Darif, 446 F.3d 701, 710 (7th Cir. 2006)\n\n(\"[T]he government is not required to show that Defendant lacked\n\nintent to establish a life with Kirklin; it need only show that\n\nDefendant entered into the marriage with Kirklin for the purpose of\n\nevading immigration laws.\").   We need not address this question\n\nhere, because it is clear on this record that a reasonable jury\n\ncould conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the marriage was\n\nentered into to evade immigration laws and that the parties did not\n\nintend to establish a life together. A reasonable jury could reach\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fthis conclusion based on the timing of the marriage and the\n\nconversations among the parties, particularly that Karim and Mann\n\ndated for only eleven days; Karim broke off the relationship before\n\nhis arrest and only reignited contact with Mann after his arrest;\n\nAnn Karim prodded Mann to help Karim with his immigration problem\n\nby marrying him; Karim repeatedly questioned Mann as to whether she\n\nwas going to \"do that thing for me\"; and Karim and Mann failed to\n\nsee each other again until Karim's criminal trial.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of\n\nconviction.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",
