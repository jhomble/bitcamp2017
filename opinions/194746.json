In this appeal we determine\n                                  \n\nwhether  appellants must pay the  entire cost of  cleaning up two\n\ndifferent  environmental hazards:    coal gas  waste and  oil gas\n\nwaste.   As  the district  court correctly  apportioned liability\n\nunder the governing principles of the Comprehensive Environmental\n\nResponse, Compensation  and Liability Act of  1980 (\"CERCLA\"), 42\n\nU.S.C.   9601 et seq., and the Massachusetts Superfund Act, Mass.\n                     \n\nAnn. L. ch. 21E (1993), we affirm.\n\n                              FACTS\n                                   \n\n          The  Lynn  Gas Light  Co.  began  manufacturing gas  in\n\nMassachusetts in the mid-1800's.  The Lynn Electric Light Co., an\n\nelectric utility, began operation some thirty years later.  These\n\ncompanies merged in 1888, by legislative decree, to form the Lynn\n\nGas and Electric Co.   That company continued to  manufacture gas\n\nfrom  coal (\"coal  gas\")  in large  quantities  until 1951,  when\n\nnatural  gas became  available.   After that  date, Lynn  Gas and\n\nElectric Co. and  the successor to its gas  business manufactured\n\ngas from oil (\"oil  gas\") in small quantities, to  supplement the\n\nsupply  of  natural  gas  during  peak  periods  of  use.    This\n\nmanufacture, called peak shaving, continued until 1972.\n\n          New England Electric System (\"NEES\"), a holding company\n\nowning various utilities  and an appellant  in this case,  bought\n\nabout 97% of the Lynn Gas and Electric Company in 1957.  In 1959,\n\nNEES  created a  new  company,  called  the  Lynn  Gas  Co.,  and\n\nstructured a transaction between the new company and the Lynn Gas\n\nand  Electric Co.  In this transaction, the Lynn Gas Co. acquired\n\n                               -2-\n\nthe gas portion of  the Lynn Gas and  Electric Co.  Lynn Gas  and\n\nElectric  Co. kept the electric  portion and changed  its name to\n\nLynn  Electric Co.     Lynn  Gas  Co. became  part  of NEES'  gas\n\ndivision.   In 1962, Lynn  Electric merged into the Massachusetts\n\nElectric  Company (\"Mass.  Electric\"), a  subsidiary of  NEES and\n\nalso an appellant in this case.  \n\n          In the  1959 Separation  Agreement, Lynn Gas  agreed to\n\nassume \"all the duties  and liabilities of Lynn Gas  and Electric\n\nrelated to such gas  business.\"  The Agreement spelled  out those\n\nduties  and liabilities,  but  did not  mention environmental  or\n\nother contingent  liabilities.  Nonetheless, Lynn  Gas Co. agreed\n\nto \"indemnify  and save harmless  Lynn Electric Company  from any\n\nduty  or  liability  with respect  to  the  gas  business.\"   The\n\nseparation of the Lynn Gas Co. from Mass.  Electric was not truly\n\ncompleted  by the Agreement.  Mass. Electric conveyed much of the\n\ngas-related real estate to Lynn Gas  in 1962, more than two years\n\nafter  the  separation  occurred,  and continued  conveying  gas-\n\nrelated parcels of land to  Lynn Gas until 1970.   Mass. Electric\n\nnever transferred other parcels.\n\n          In  1964 the SEC ordered  NEES to divest  itself of its\n\ngas  holdings under the Public Utilities  Holding Company Act, 15\n\nU.S.C.    79a et seq.   The Supreme Court  affirmed.  SEC  v. New\n                                                                 \n\nEngland Electric System, 390 U.S. 207 (1968).  NEES finalized the\n                       \n\ndivestiture in 1973  by selling  Lynn Gas and  several other  gas\n\ncompanies  to Boston Gas, a  company unaffiliated with  NEES.  In\n\nthe  Purchase   Agreement,  Boston  Gas  agreed   to  assume  the\n\n                               -3-\n\nliabilities of Lynn Gas \"as then existing.\"  A similar clause  in\n\nthe later  document entitled  Assumption of  Liabilities provided\n\nthat Boston Gas would assume all liabilities \"outstanding  at the\n\ndate hereof.\"  The Lynn Gas Co. was dissolved in 1980.\n\n          Some of the land upon which the Lynn Gas &amp; Electric Co.\n\nand Lynn Gas  Co. manufactured  gas was taken  by eminent  domain\n\nfrom Boston  Gas and Mass. Electric  in 1981 and  sold to outside\n\nbuyers.   When  these buyers  discovered  that the  property  was\n\ncontaminated   by  coal   gas   waste,  they   sued  NEES,   NEES\n\nsubsidiaries, and  Boston Gas under CERCLA  and its Massachusetts\n\nparallel.1  During  the course of  the suit,  Boston Gas filed  a\n\nclaim  against NEES because oil gas  waste, generated after 1951,\n\ncontaminated property it acquired in the Lynn Gas Co. deal.\n\n          The case  proceeded  in two  phases.   The first  phase\n\nresulted  in  a  partial  consent decree  holding  the  utilities\n\njointly  and severally liable to plaintiffs for the cleanup.  The\n\nsecond  phase concerned liability among the utilities, and is the\n\nsubject of  this appeal.  In the second phase, the court assigned\n\nfull  liability to Mass. Electric,  as the successor  of the Lynn\n\nGas  and  Electric Co.,  for  the cleanup  of  coal gas  waste on\n\nplaintiffs' property.    The  court  also ordered  NEES  and  its\n\nsubsidiary  New England Power Service  Co. (\"NEPSCO\")2 to pay for\n\n                    \n\n1   Plaintiffs also raised other claims, but their disposition is\nnot at issue on appeal.\n\n2     NEPSCO   is   a  service   company  devoted   to  providing\nadministrative,  engineering,   and   other  services   to   NEES\ncompanies.\n\n                               -4-\n\nthe  cleanup of  oil gas  waste  on Boston  Gas' property.   This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                               -5-\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                      \n\n          Under CERCLA3, four parties  may be responsible for the\n\ncosts  of an environmental  cleanup.   These are:   the  owner or\n\noperator  of a  contaminated vessel  or facility;  the  owner and\n\noperator  of a facility at  the time it  became contaminated; any\n\nperson who  arranges for the  transport or disposal  of hazardous\n\nwastes;  and  any person  who  accepts hazardous  wastes  for the\n\npurposes of transport or disposal.   42 U.S.C.   9607(a).  Courts\n\nhave interpreted  this statute to include  successor corporations\n\nin a  merger situation,  e.g.,  Anspec Co.  v. Johnson  Controls,\n                                                                 \n\nInc.,  922 F.2d  1240,  1245 (6th  Cir. 1991);  Louisiana-Pacific\n                                                                 \n\nCorp.  v.

CERCLA  \"is in many\nways analogous to the  Massachusetts statute.\"  Acme Laundry  Co.\n                                                                 \nv.

Cumberland Farms\n                                                                 \nDairy,  Inc., 889 F.2d 1146, 1156  (1st Cir. 1989) (Massachusetts\n            \nstatute \"is  patterned after  the federal CERCLA  statute\").   As\nsuch,  the  Massachusetts courts  construe  it in  line  with the\nFederal decisions  \"absent compelling reasons to  the contrary or\nsignificant  differences  in  content.\"    Rollins  Environmental\n                                                                 \nServices,  Inc. v.

Of course,  the\nMassachusetts statute differs from CERCLA  in some respects.  See\n                                                                 \nGriffith v. New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 414 Mass. 824,\n                                                 \n610 N.E.2d  944 (1993)  (defining owner and  operator differently\nfor  the  purposes of  strict liability).    We will  not discuss\nMassachusetts law unless it becomes relevant to the case.\n\n                               -6-\n\n(D. R.I. 1989).\n\n          The  list  of  responsible  parties  reflects  CERCLA's\n\n\"essential  purpose\"  of making  \"those responsible  for problems\n\ncaused by the  disposal of  chemical poisons bear  the costs  and\n\nresponsibility   for  remedying   the  harmful   conditions  they\n\ncreated.\"   Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 805\n                                                            \n\nF.2d  1074,  1081  (1st Cir.  1986).4    CERCLA  thus makes  such\n\nparties  liable to the government or to other private parties for\n\nthe costs of a cleanup.  Id.\n                            \n\n          If   9607(a)  imposes liability on  a party, then  that\n\nparty cannot escape liability by means of a contract with another\n\nparty.    42 U.S.C.     9607(e)(1)  provides  that \"[n]o  .  .  .\n\nagreement  or conveyance shall be  effective to transfer from the\n\nowner  or operator of  any vessel or facility  or from any person\n\nwho may be  liable for a release or threat  of release under this\n\nsection, to any  other person  the liability  imposed under  this\n\nsection.\"  That is, the government or a private  party can pursue\n\nany responsible party it desires.  \n\n          Two  or more  parties,  however, can  allocate ultimate\n\nresponsibility among  themselves by  contract.  The  same statute\n\nstates that \"[n]othing in this subsection shall bar any agreement\n\nto  insure, hold harmless, or indemnify a party to such agreement\n\n                    \n\n4  In Dedham Water, we recognized one other fundamental policy of\n                  \nCERCLA:    \"Congress  intended  that the  federal  government  be\nimmediately given the tools necessary for  a prompt and effective\nresponse  to the  problems of  national magnitude  resulting from\nhazardous waste disposal.\"  805 F.2d at 1081.  That policy is not\nimplicated in this appeal.\n\n                               -7-\n\nfor any liability under this section.\"  Id.  Such agreements have\n                                           \n\nbeen  described as  \"tangential\"  to the  enforcement of  CERCLA.\n\nJones-Hamilton Co.  v. Beazer  Materials and Services,  Inc., 973\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 688, 692 (9th Cir. 1992).\n\n          Appellants  contend that  the  district court  erred in\n\nimposing  the full cost of cleanup  in this case on them because,\n\nas companies separate from the  Lynn Gas and Electric Co.  or the\n\nLynn  Gas Co.,  they are  not  responsible parties  under CERCLA.\n\nRather, the district court  should have imposed the full  cost of\n\ncleanup  on appellee  Boston  Gas.    Appellants arrive  at  this\n\nconclusion in two steps.  First, they argue that the Lynn Gas Co.\n\nis the  direct successor to the  gas portion of the  Lynn Gas and\n\nElectric  Co.,  and  assumed  its  coal  gas  liability.    Next,\n\nappellants  argue that Boston Gas,  as the successor  of the Lynn\n\nGas Co., assumed its  coal and oil gas liabilities.   We disagree\n\nwith appellant on all points.\n\n                                I.\n\n          We first  discuss who is  responsible for the  coal gas\n\nwaste  created before  any of the  present parties  were involved\n\nwith  the  Lynn  Gas and  Electric  Co.    To accept  appellant's\n\nconclusion,  we must  find  that the  liability shifted  from the\n\nindependent Lynn Gas and Electric Co., to the NEES-owned Lynn Gas\n\nand Electric Co. (renamed the Lynn Electric Co.), to the Lynn Gas\n\nCo., and finally to Boston Gas.  We cannot do so, as the district\n\ncourt  correctly found that the  chain of liability  for coal gas\n\nwaste broke at the link between NEES and the Lynn Gas Co.\n\n                               -8-\n\n          When  NEES  bought  Lynn   Gas  and  Electric  Co.,  it\n\nmaintained  that company  as  a separate  entity with  continuing\n\nliability under CERCLA for the waste it created before 1951.  See\n                                                                 \n\n42  U.S.C.    9607(a)(1) (owner  and  operator  of  a  vessel  or\n\nfacility is a responsible party).  When NEES sold the gas portion\n\nof  Lynn Gas and Electric Co.  to the newly-created Lynn Gas Co.,\n\nthe environmental liabilities  of Lynn Gas  and Electric did  not\n\ndisappear.\n\n          Consistent with CERCLA's policy  of holding the company\n\nthat sullied  the property responsible for the  costs of cleanup,\n\nsee  Dedham  Water, supra,  those  liabilities  travelled to  the\n                         \n\nsuccessor, if  any, of Lynn  Gas and Electric.   See 42  U.S.C.  \n                                                    \n\n9607(a)(2) (owner or operator of facility at time of discharge is\n\na responsible party); Smith Land  &amp; Improvement Corp. v.  Celotex\n                                                                 \n\nCorp., 851  F.2d 86, 91  (3d Cir. 1988),  cert. denied, 488  U.S.\n                                                      \n\n1029 (1989).\n\n          Initially, Lynn Gas and  Electric Co. and Lynn Electric\n\nCo. were  the same entities.   That fact is  reflected not merely\n\nbecause  of a  simple  name change,  but  also because  the  Lynn\n\nElectric Co. kept  Lynn Gas  and Electric's property.   As  noted\n\nabove, the Lynn  Electric Co.,  which by then  merged into  Mass.\n\nElectric,  conveyed the gas-related property  to the Lynn Gas Co.\n\nat various  points  between 1962  and  1970.   By  virtue of  the\n\nmerger,  Mass.  Electric  became  the  heir  to  the  assets  and\n\nliabilities of the Lynn Electric Co.  See Smith Land, 851 F.2d at\n                                                    \n\n91  (\"In case  of merger  . . . where  one corporation  ceases to\n\n                               -9-\n\nexist  and  the other  corporation  continues  in existence,  the\n\nlatter corporation is  liable for the debts,  contracts and torts\n\nof the former\").\n\n          The  question,  then,  is  whether  the  Lynn  Gas  and\n\nElectric   Co.  transferred   to  the   Lynn  Gas   Co.  ultimate\n\nresponsibility  for  environmental  hazards  by  contract.    The\n\nrelevant document is the  Separation Agreement (the  \"Agreement\")\n\nentered  into between the parties  on September 9,  1959; a later\n\nindenture  also  bears  on  the   issue.    As  neither  document\n\napportions  CERCLA  liabilities explicitly,  we must  discern the\n\nintent of  the parties.  We  do this by reference  to other cases\n\ndealing with nonexplicit assumptions of liability in order to set\n\na standard by which to measure that intent.\n\n          We note  at  the outset  that  the district  court  was\n\nuncertain whether  to use a state rule of contract interpretation\n\nor a uniform federal rule.  Indeed, while federal law governs the\n\nvalidity of  liability agreements  in the CERCLA  context, Mardan\n                                                                 \n\nCorp. v. C.G.C.

First, \"laws\n\nenacted  after the  execution of  an  agreement are  not commonly\n\nconsidered to become part of  the agreement unless its provisions\n\nclearly  establish  that  the  parties  intended  to  incorporate\n\nsubsequent enactments  into their agreement.\"   Arthur D.

Second, \"a general  release . . . is to\n\nbe given effect, even if the parties did not have in mind all the\n\n                               -11-\n\nwrongs which existed at the time of the release,\" so  long as the\n\nlanguage  of  that release  is  broad  enough to  encompass  such\n\ncontingent liability.   Naukeag Inn,  Inc. v. Rideout,  351 Mass.\n                                                     \n\n353, 220 N.E.2d 916, 918 (1966).\n\n          These  principles   essentially   lead  to   one   rule\n\napplicable to  the present case.   To transfer  CERCLA liability,\n\nthe Agreement must contain  language broad enough to allow  us to\n\nsay  that the  parties  intended to  transfer either  contingent,\n\nenvironmental liability,  or all  liability.  The  Agreement must\n\nrecognize the  possibility of  future liability or  dispense Lynn\n\nGas and Electric  of all  liabilities in  the form  of a  general\n\nrelease.    Unfortunately for  appellants,  the  language of  the\n\nAgreement is not drafted in such broad terms.\n\n          While initially the Agreement  provides that \"Lynn  Gas\n\nwill assume and take over all the duties and liabilities\" related\n\nto the gas business, the Agreement later lists those obligations.\n\nThe series  contains obligations pertaining only  to the existing\n\nbusiness,  such  as obligations  to  serve  gas customers,  honor\n\ncontracts  for the  purchase  and  sale  of new  facilities,  and\n\nprovide  reserves to account for bad debt and depreciation on the\n\ngas  plant.   No reference  is made  to any future  or contingent\n\nliabilities.  \n\n          An indenture entered into by the parties several months\n\nlater  contains  a  similar  list.    A  catch-all  provision  on\n\nliability refers to the liabilities \"indicated in summary form by\n\nthe  balance sheet\" attached to the document, revealing an intent\n\n                               -12-\n\nthat the only liabilities assumed were those known, existing, and\n\nsomehow accounted  for at the time of execution.  It is true that\n\nthe indenture states that the liabilities specifically assumed by\n\nLynn Gas are \"without  implied limitation.\"  But it  is one thing\n\nto  say that  the list  of liabilities  is not  all-inclusive and\n\nquite  another  to  assume  that the  obligations  not  specified\n\ninclude then non-existent environmental liabilities to be created\n\nunder CERCLA and unforeseeable when the agreement was made.\n\n          We must  conclude that  neither document  evidences the\n\nintent to transfer environmental liability in the requisite broad\n\nlanguage.  The responsible  party in this case, as  between Mass.\n\nElectric  and Boston Gas, is  Mass. Electric --  the successor to\n\nthe Lynn Gas and Electric Co.  See ante at 7-8.\n                                       \n\n                               II.\n\n          We now discuss who is responsible for the oil gas waste\n\ncontaminating  the property  owned by  Boston Gas.   To  find for\n\nappellants,  we must determine  that Boston Gas  agreed to assume\n\nthe environmental  liabilities of the  oil gas waste  produced by\n\nLynn  Gas Co.  between  1951 and  1970.   Happily,  the  contract\n\nprinciples that steered  our analysis  on the issue  of coal  gas\n\nwaste steer  most of our  analysis on this  issue also.   We must\n\ndetermine  whether  Boston  Gas agreed  to  assume  environmental\n\nliabilities in its agreement to buy Lynn Gas Co.5\n\n                    \n\n5  Technically, NEES sold  the Lynn Gas Co. first to  Eastern Gas\nand Fuel Associates, the  parent company of Boston Gas.   Eastern\nthen sold Lynn Gas to  Boston Gas on the same day.   Because this\nintermediate  transaction does  not alter  any liability  in this\ncase  by statute, contract, or any other norm, we discuss Eastern\n\n                               -13-\n\n          The contract  governing the sale of Lynn  Gas to Boston\n\nGas,  the Closing Agreement, provides an easier case than did the\n\nAgreement  discussed  above.    The Closing  Agreement  expressly\n\nlimited the liabilities assumed  by Boston Gas to those  \"as then\n\nexisting.\"   A similar  clause in  the Assumption  of Liabilities\n\ndocument  provided  that  Boston  Gas  would  assume  only  those\n\nliabilities  \"outstanding at  the  date hereof.\"   Such  language\n\nfairly  obviously  forecloses  the possibility  that  Boston  Gas\n\nagreed  to  assume  any  contingent liabilities,  much  less  the\n\nenvironmental  liabilities  at  issue   here.    Nothing  in  the\n\nremaining documents changes this conclusion.  \n\n          Apart from  the language of the  contract, the district\n\ncourt found several other facts convincing in finding that Boston\n\nGas lacked the intent to assume the liability here at issue.  For\n\nexample,  the  parties did  not discuss  oil  gas waste  in their\n\nnegotiations.  Indeed,  it does  not appear that  Boston Gas  was\n\ninformed about the oil gas waste at all.   Furthermore, there was\n\nno  communication  between  the  parties  about   any  contingent\n\nliabilities not  appearing on  the  balance sheet.   These  facts\n\nbolster  our confidence  in concluding  that Boston  Gas did  not\n\naccept those liabilities.\n\n          Although  we are  convinced that  Boston Gas  cannot be\n\nheld liable for the oil gas waste, we must determine whether  the\n\ndistrict court  was correct to  impose those liabilities  on NEES\n\nand  NEPSCO.   In other  words, are  NEES and  NEPSCO responsible\n\n                    \n\nno further.\n\n                               -14-\n\nparties?\n\n          In  Kayser-Roth, 910  F.2d  at 26,  we determined  that\n                         \n\nparent  companies can  be  held liable  for  CERCLA liability  as\n\noperators  of   a  contaminated   facility  under  42   U.S.C.   \n\n9607(a)(2).6   Such liability is  direct; it does  not require us\n\nto pierce the  corporate veil.  Id. at 27  (\"Kayser is being held\n                                   \n\nliable for its activities as an operator, not the activities of a\n              \n\nsubsidiary\").  In contrast, piercing the corporate veil is a form\n\nof  owner liability.   Kayser  Roth,  724 F.  Supp. at  23.   The\n                                   \n\ndistrict  court  determined that  Kayser  was liable  both  as an\n\noperator and an owner.  Id. at 22-24.  When the case came  before\n                           \n\nour court, we left  open the question of owner  liability because\n\nour   finding   on  operator   liability   resolved  the   issues\n\nsatisfactorily.  910 F.2d at 28 n.11.  \n\n          We envisioned in Kayser that holding a parent liable as\n                                 \n\nan operator would  be somewhat unusual.   Id. at  27.  \"To be  an\n                                             \n\noperator  requires more  than merely  complete ownership  and the\n\nconcomitant general  authority or  ability to control  that comes\n\nwith ownership.  At  a minimum it requires active  involvement in\n\nthe activities of the  subsidiary.\"  Id.  This  standard requires\n                                        \n\nan  investigation into  the relationship  between the  parent and\n\nsubsidiary,  in order to reveal  the requisite level of corporate\n\ninvolvement.    As  the  question is  fact-laden,  we  review the\n\ndistrict court's findings only for clear error.  Id.\n                                                    \n\n                    \n\n6   That  section holds  liable \"any  person who  at the  time of\ndisposal  of  any  hazardous  substance  owned  or  operated  any\nfacility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of.\"\n\n                               -15-\n\n          The relationship  among the relevant companies  in this\n\ncase amply demonstrates that  operator liability burdens NEES and\n\nNEPSCO  with the responsibility to  purge the oil  gas waste from\n\nBoston Gas'  property.  We recite  only a few of  the facts which\n\nthe district  court  found dispositive,  and  which we  too  find\n\nimportant.\n\n          NEES   continually  maintained  a  presence  among  the\n\nofficers and  directors of Lynn Gas.   The president of  Lynn Gas\n\nwas also the president of NEES' gas division; he was appointed by\n\nthe  chairman of  NEES and reported  directly to  NEES officials.\n\nNEES selected the directors of Lynn Gas,  and a senior officer of\n\nNEES approved Lynn Gas' budget.  Lynn Gas needed approval for all\n\nexpenditures over $5,000.   NEPSCO provided extensive services to\n\nLynn Gas, such as controlling the checking  account, handling the\n\npurchase  of the oil used  in peak shaving,  and maintaining Lynn\n\nGas property.  NEPSCO employees were  also well represented among\n\nLynn's officers and directors.  \n\n          Given  the almost overwhelming  evidence, we cannot say\n\nthat  the district court clearly  erred in finding  that NEES and\n\nNEPSCO  were  operators of  the Lynn  Gas  facilities.   NEES and\n\nNEPSCO  are responsible  parties  for the  oil gas  waste created\n\nwhile they were linked to the Lynn Gas Co.\n\n                               III.\n\n          We must resolve several residual matters, but they need\n\nnot detain us long.\n\n          Appellants   contend  that  under   the  principles  of\n\n                               -16-\n\nsuccessor liability, Boston Gas must be liable for the cleanup of\n\nthe waste sites.  Appellants' argument has initial appeal in that\n\nBoston Gas, and Lynn Gas before it, took over the gas business of\n\nother companies.   This argument, however,  does not reflect  the\n\nsuccessor corporation  doctrine.   In  Dayton v.  Peck, Stow  and\n                                                                 \n\nWilcox Co., 739 F.2d 690, 692 (1st Cir. 1984), we identified four\n          \n\nsituations in which successor liability is appropriate:  when the\n\nbuyer  agrees to  assume liability;  when  a consolidation  or de\n\nfacto merger occurs; when  the buyer is merely a  continuation of\n\nthe  seller;  and  when the  transaction  is  a  fraud to  escape\n\nliability.  \n\n          We have  already determined  that Boston Gas,  and Lynn\n\nGas  before it, did not  agree to assume environmental liability.\n\nFurthermore, there is no allegation of fraud in  this case.  Only\n\nthe merger  and continuation situations remain to bind Boston Gas\n\nas successor to the gas liabilities in this case.   There was, of\n\ncourse,  no formal  merger  by which  Lynn Gas  Co. --  and later\n\nBoston  Gas -- assumed the  liabilities of Lynn  Gas and Electric\n\nCo., so appellants  would have to prove a de  facto merger claim.\n\nCentral  to a  de  facto merger  or  continuation of  the  seller\n\ncorporation  claim, however,  is  a  finding  that  shareholders,\n\nofficers and directors continued into the buyer corporation.  Id.\n                                                                 \n\nat 693.  Boston Gas, however, did not share any such  continuity.\n\nThe  successor corporation  doctrine  actually supports  imposing\n\nliability on  appellants, as the requisite  continuity existed in\n\ntheir corporate structures.\n\n                               -17-\n\n          Appellants also argue that  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 164    98\n\nrequires  the  assumption  by  Boston Gas  of  the  environmental\n\nliabilities at issue here.  That brief statute states that \"[t]he\n\npurchasing  or consolidated company shall . . . be subject to all\n\nthe duties, liabilities and  restrictions, of the company selling\n\nor merged  as aforesaid, so  far as  they are  applicable to  the\n\npurchasing or  consolidated company.\"   The district  court found\n\nthat  the statute  simply serves  to allocate  the rights  of the\n\npublic  with respect to the  utilities, and does  not curtail the\n\nrights  of  contracting parties  to  allocate  ultimate liability\n\nbetween themselves.\n\n          We find no error in the district court's interpretation\n\nof   98.  The documents transferring the gas business to Lynn Gas\n\nCo. and  later selling Lynn Gas  Co. to Boston Gas  both refer to\n\n  98.  The documents proceed to list the present liabilities owed\n\nby  the companies to customers  and other members  of the public.\n\nThe  parties thus  understood  the statute  to allocate  certain,\n\nexisting liabilities only.  The liabilities at issue in this case\n\nare not among them.\n\n          Finally,  appellants argue that  equity requires Boston\n\nGas  to share  in  the cost  of  the cleanup.    We find  nothing\n\ninequitable  in  imposing  those   costs  solely  on  appellants,\n\nhowever.    The policy  underlying CERCLA  --  to make  those who\n\nbefouled  the  environment  responsible  for its  cleanup  --  is\n\ncertainly  equitable.  See  Dedham Water, 805  F.2d at  1081.  We\n                                        \n\nhave found that appellants were the proper responsible parties in\n\n                               -18-\n\nthis case, and it is equitable for them to clean up the property.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -19-\n",

As  the district  court correctly  apportioned liability\n\nunder the governing principles of the Comprehensive Environmental\n\nResponse, Compensation  and Liability Act of  1980 (\"CERCLA\"), 42\n\nU.S.C.   9601 et seq., and the Massachusetts Superfund Act, Mass.\n                     \n\nAnn. L. ch. 21E (1993), we affirm.\n\n                              FACTS\n                                   \n\n          The  Lynn  Gas Light  Co.  began  manufacturing gas  in\n\nMassachusetts in the mid-1800's.  The Lynn Electric Light Co., an\n\nelectric utility, began operation some thirty years later.  These\n\ncompanies merged in 1888, by legislative decree, to form the Lynn\n\nGas and Electric Co.   That company continued to  manufacture gas\n\nfrom  coal (\"coal  gas\")  in large  quantities  until 1951,  when\n\nnatural  gas became  available.   After that  date, Lynn  Gas and\n\nElectric Co. and  the successor to its gas  business manufactured\n\ngas from oil (\"oil  gas\") in small quantities, to  supplement the\n\nsupply  of  natural  gas  during  peak  periods  of  use.    This\n\nmanufacture, called peak shaving, continued until 1972.\n\n          New England Electric System (\"NEES\"), a holding company\n\nowning various utilities  and an appellant  in this case,  bought\n\nabout 97% of the Lynn Gas and Electric Company in 1957.  In 1959,\n\nNEES  created a  new  company,  called  the  Lynn  Gas  Co.,  and\n\nstructured a transaction between the new company and the Lynn Gas\n\nand  Electric Co.  In this transaction, the Lynn Gas Co. acquired\n\n                               -2-\n\nthe gas portion of  the Lynn Gas and  Electric Co.  Lynn Gas  and\n\nElectric  Co. kept the electric  portion and changed  its name to\n\nLynn  Electric Co.     Lynn  Gas  Co. became  part  of NEES'  gas\n\ndivision.   In 1962, Lynn  Electric merged into the Massachusetts\n\nElectric  Company (\"Mass.  Electric\"), a  subsidiary of  NEES and\n\nalso an appellant in this case.  \n\n          In the  1959 Separation  Agreement, Lynn Gas  agreed to\n\nassume \"all the duties  and liabilities of Lynn Gas  and Electric\n\nrelated to such gas  business.\"  The Agreement spelled  out those\n\nduties  and liabilities,  but  did not  mention environmental  or\n\nother contingent  liabilities.  Nonetheless, Lynn  Gas Co. agreed\n\nto \"indemnify  and save harmless  Lynn Electric Company  from any\n\nduty  or  liability  with respect  to  the  gas  business.\"   The\n\nseparation of the Lynn Gas Co. from Mass.  Electric was not truly\n\ncompleted  by the Agreement.  Mass. Electric conveyed much of the\n\ngas-related real estate to Lynn Gas  in 1962, more than two years\n\nafter  the  separation  occurred,  and continued  conveying  gas-\n\nrelated parcels of land to  Lynn Gas until 1970.   Mass. Electric\n\nnever transferred other parcels.\n\n          In  1964 the SEC ordered  NEES to divest  itself of its\n\ngas  holdings under the Public Utilities  Holding Company Act, 15\n\nU.S.C.    79a et seq.   The Supreme Court  affirmed.  SEC  v. New\n                                                                 \n\nEngland Electric System, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107622\"><a href=\"/opinion/107622/sec-v-new-england-elec-system/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968).  NEES finalized the\n                       \n\ndivestiture in 1973  by selling  Lynn Gas and  several other  gas\n\ncompanies  to Boston Gas, a  company unaffiliated with  NEES.  In\n\nthe  Purchase   Agreement,  Boston  Gas  agreed   to  assume  the\n\n                               -3-\n\nliabilities of Lynn Gas \"as then existing.\"  A similar clause  in\n\nthe later  document entitled  Assumption of  Liabilities provided\n\nthat Boston Gas would assume all liabilities \"outstanding  at the\n\ndate hereof.\"  The Lynn Gas Co. was dissolved in 1980.\n\n          Some of the land upon which the Lynn Gas &amp; Electric Co.\n\nand Lynn Gas  Co. manufactured  gas was taken  by eminent  domain\n\nfrom Boston  Gas and Mass. Electric  in 1981 and  sold to outside\n\nbuyers.   When  these buyers  discovered  that the  property  was\n\ncontaminated   by  coal   gas   waste,  they   sued  NEES,   NEES\n\nsubsidiaries, and  Boston Gas under CERCLA  and its Massachusetts\n\nparallel.1  During  the course of  the suit,  Boston Gas filed  a\n\nclaim  against NEES because oil gas  waste, generated after 1951,\n\ncontaminated property it acquired in the Lynn Gas Co. deal.\n\n          The case  proceeded  in two  phases.   The first  phase\n\nresulted  in  a  partial  consent decree  holding  the  utilities\n\njointly  and severally liable to plaintiffs for the cleanup.  The\n\nsecond  phase concerned liability among the utilities, and is the\n\nsubject of  this appeal.  In the second phase, the court assigned\n\nfull  liability to Mass. Electric,  as the successor  of the Lynn\n\nGas  and  Electric Co.,  for  the cleanup  of  coal gas  waste on\n\nplaintiffs' property.    The  court  also ordered  NEES  and  its\n\nsubsidiary  New England Power Service  Co.

These are:   the  owner or\n\noperator  of a  contaminated vessel  or facility;  the  owner and\n\noperator  of a facility at  the time it  became contaminated; any\n\nperson who  arranges for the  transport or disposal  of hazardous\n\nwastes;  and  any person  who  accepts hazardous  wastes  for the\n\npurposes of transport or disposal.   42 U.S.C.   9607(a).

First, they argue that the Lynn Gas Co.\n\nis the  direct successor to the  gas portion of the  Lynn Gas and\n\nElectric  Co.,  and  assumed  its  coal  gas  liability.    Next,\n\nappellants  argue that Boston Gas,  as the successor  of the Lynn\n\nGas Co., assumed its  coal and oil gas liabilities.

To accept  appellant's\n\nconclusion,  we must  find  that the  liability shifted  from the\n\nindependent Lynn Gas and Electric Co., to the NEES-owned Lynn Gas\n\nand Electric Co. (renamed the Lynn Electric Co.), to the Lynn Gas\n\nCo., and finally to Boston Gas.  We cannot do so, as the district\n\ncourt  correctly found that the  chain of liability  for coal gas\n\nwaste broke at the link between NEES and the Lynn Gas Co.\n\n                               -8-\n\n          When  NEES  bought  Lynn   Gas  and  Electric  Co.,  it\n\nmaintained  that company  as  a separate  entity with  continuing\n\nliability under CERCLA for the waste it created before 1951.

That fact is  reflected not merely\n\nbecause  of a  simple  name change,  but  also because  the  Lynn\n\nElectric Co. kept  Lynn Gas  and Electric's property.   As  noted\n\nabove, the Lynn  Electric Co.,  which by then  merged into  Mass.\n\nElectric,  conveyed the gas-related property  to the Lynn Gas Co.\n\nat various  points  between 1962  and  1970.

The\n\nrelevant document is the  Separation Agreement (the  \"Agreement\")\n\nentered  into between the parties  on September 9,  1959; a later\n\nindenture  also  bears  on  the   issue.    As  neither  document\n\napportions  CERCLA  liabilities explicitly,  we must  discern the\n\nintent of  the parties.

To transfer  CERCLA liability,\n\nthe Agreement must contain  language broad enough to allow  us to\n\nsay  that the  parties  intended to  transfer either  contingent,\n\nenvironmental liability,  or all  liability.  The  Agreement must\n\nrecognize the  possibility of  future liability or  dispense Lynn\n\nGas and Electric  of all  liabilities in  the form  of a  general\n\nrelease.    Unfortunately for  appellants,  the  language of  the\n\nAgreement is not drafted in such broad terms.\n\n          While initially the Agreement  provides that \"Lynn  Gas\n\nwill assume and take over all the duties and liabilities\" related\n\nto the gas business, the Agreement later lists those obligations.\n\nThe series  contains obligations pertaining only  to the existing\n\nbusiness,  such  as obligations  to  serve  gas customers,  honor\n\ncontracts  for the  purchase  and  sale  of new  facilities,  and\n\nprovide  reserves to account for bad debt and depreciation on the\n\ngas  plant.   No reference  is made  to any future  or contingent\n\nliabilities.  \n\n          An indenture entered into by the parties several months\n\nlater  contains  a  similar  list.    A  catch-all  provision  on\n\nliability refers to the liabilities \"indicated in summary form by\n\nthe  balance sheet\" attached to the document, revealing an intent\n\n                               -12-\n\nthat the only liabilities assumed were those known, existing, and\n\nsomehow accounted  for at the time of execution.  It is true that\n\nthe indenture states that the liabilities specifically assumed by\n\nLynn Gas are \"without  implied limitation.\"  But it  is one thing\n\nto  say that  the list  of liabilities  is not  all-inclusive and\n\nquite  another  to  assume  that the  obligations  not  specified\n\ninclude then non-existent environmental liabilities to be created\n\nunder CERCLA and unforeseeable when the agreement was made.\n\n          We must  conclude that  neither document  evidences the\n\nintent to transfer environmental liability in the requisite broad\n\nlanguage.  The responsible  party in this case, as  between Mass.\n\nElectric  and Boston Gas, is  Mass. Electric --  the successor to\n\nthe Lynn Gas and Electric Co.  See ante at 7-8.\n                                       \n\n                               II.\n\n          We now discuss who is responsible for the oil gas waste\n\ncontaminating  the property  owned by  Boston Gas.   To  find for\n\nappellants,  we must determine  that Boston Gas  agreed to assume\n\nthe environmental  liabilities of the  oil gas waste  produced by\n\nLynn  Gas Co.  between  1951 and  1970.   Happily,  the  contract\n\nprinciples that steered  our analysis  on the issue  of coal  gas\n\nwaste steer  most of our  analysis on this  issue also.   We must\n\ndetermine  whether  Boston  Gas agreed  to  assume  environmental\n\nliabilities in its agreement to buy Lynn Gas Co.5\n\n                    \n\n5  Technically, NEES sold  the Lynn Gas Co. first to  Eastern Gas\nand Fuel Associates, the  parent company of Boston Gas.   Eastern\nthen sold Lynn Gas to  Boston Gas on the same day.   Because this\nintermediate  transaction does  not alter  any liability  in this\ncase  by statute, contract, or any other norm, we discuss Eastern\n\n                               -13-\n\n          The contract  governing the sale of Lynn  Gas to Boston\n\nGas,  the Closing Agreement, provides an easier case than did the\n\nAgreement  discussed  above.    The Closing  Agreement  expressly\n\nlimited the liabilities assumed  by Boston Gas to those  \"as then\n\nexisting.\"   A similar  clause in  the Assumption  of Liabilities\n\ndocument  provided  that  Boston  Gas  would  assume  only  those\n\nliabilities  \"outstanding at  the  date hereof.\"   Such  language\n\nfairly  obviously  forecloses  the possibility  that  Boston  Gas\n\nagreed  to  assume  any  contingent liabilities,  much  less  the\n\nenvironmental  liabilities  at  issue   here.    Nothing  in  the\n\nremaining documents changes this conclusion.  \n\n          Apart from  the language of the  contract, the district\n\ncourt found several other facts convincing in finding that Boston\n\nGas lacked the intent to assume the liability here at issue.  For\n\nexample,  the  parties did  not discuss  oil  gas waste  in their\n\nnegotiations.  Indeed,  it does  not appear that  Boston Gas  was\n\ninformed about the oil gas waste at all.   Furthermore, there was\n\nno  communication  between  the  parties  about   any  contingent\n\nliabilities not  appearing on  the  balance sheet.   These  facts\n\nbolster  our confidence  in concluding  that Boston  Gas did  not\n\naccept those liabilities.\n\n          Although  we are  convinced that  Boston Gas  cannot be\n\nheld liable for the oil gas waste, we must determine whether  the\n\ndistrict court  was correct to  impose those liabilities  on NEES\n\nand  NEPSCO.   In other  words, are  NEES and  NEPSCO responsible\n\n                    \n\nno further.\n\n                               -14-\n\nparties?\n\n          In  Kayser-Roth, 910  F.2d  at 26,  we determined  that\n                         \n\nparent  companies can  be  held liable  for  CERCLA liability  as\n\noperators  of   a  contaminated   facility  under  42   U.S.C.   \n\n9607(a)(2).6   Such liability is  direct; it does  not require us\n\nto pierce the  corporate veil.  Id. at 27  (\"Kayser is being held\n                                   \n\nliable for its activities as an operator, not the activities of a\n              \n\nsubsidiary\").  In contrast, piercing the corporate veil is a form\n\nof  owner liability.   Kayser  Roth,  724 F.  Supp. at  23.   The\n                                   \n\ndistrict  court  determined that  Kayser  was liable  both  as an\n\noperator and an owner.  Id. at 22-24.  When the case came  before\n                           \n\nour court, we left  open the question of owner  liability because\n\nour   finding   on  operator   liability   resolved  the   issues\n\nsatisfactorily.  910 F.2d at 28 n.11.  \n\n          We envisioned in Kayser that holding a parent liable as\n                                 \n\nan operator would  be somewhat unusual.   Id. at  27.  \"To be  an\n                                             \n\noperator  requires more  than merely  complete ownership  and the\n\nconcomitant general  authority or  ability to control  that comes\n\nwith ownership.  At  a minimum it requires active  involvement in\n\nthe activities of the  subsidiary.\"  Id.  This  standard requires\n                                        \n\nan  investigation into  the relationship  between the  parent and\n\nsubsidiary,  in order to reveal  the requisite level of corporate\n\ninvolvement.    As  the  question is  fact-laden,  we  review the\n\ndistrict court's findings only for clear error.  Id.\n                                                    \n\n                    \n\n6   That  section holds  liable \"any  person who  at the  time of\ndisposal  of  any  hazardous  substance  owned  or  operated  any\nfacility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of.\"\n\n                               -15-\n\n          The relationship  among the relevant companies  in this\n\ncase amply demonstrates that  operator liability burdens NEES and\n\nNEPSCO  with the responsibility to  purge the oil  gas waste from\n\nBoston Gas'  property.  We recite  only a few of  the facts which\n\nthe district  court  found dispositive,  and  which we  too  find\n\nimportant.\n\n          NEES   continually  maintained  a  presence  among  the\n\nofficers and  directors of Lynn Gas.   The president of  Lynn Gas\n\nwas also the president of NEES' gas division; he was appointed by\n\nthe  chairman of  NEES and reported  directly to  NEES officials.\n\nNEES selected the directors of Lynn Gas,  and a senior officer of\n\nNEES approved Lynn Gas' budget.  Lynn Gas needed approval for all\n\nexpenditures over $5,000.   NEPSCO provided extensive services to\n\nLynn Gas, such as controlling the checking  account, handling the\n\npurchase  of the oil used  in peak shaving,  and maintaining Lynn\n\nGas property.  NEPSCO employees were  also well represented among\n\nLynn's officers and directors.  \n\n          Given  the almost overwhelming  evidence, we cannot say\n\nthat  the district court clearly  erred in finding  that NEES and\n\nNEPSCO  were  operators of  the Lynn  Gas  facilities.   NEES and\n\nNEPSCO  are responsible  parties  for the  oil gas  waste created\n\nwhile they were linked to the Lynn Gas Co.\n\n                               III.\n\n          We must resolve several residual matters, but they need\n\nnot detain us long.\n\n          Appellants   contend  that  under   the  principles  of\n\n                               -16-\n\nsuccessor liability, Boston Gas must be liable for the cleanup of\n\nthe waste sites.  Appellants' argument has initial appeal in that\n\nBoston Gas, and Lynn Gas before it, took over the gas business of\n\nother companies.   This argument, however,  does not reflect  the\n\nsuccessor corporation  doctrine.   In  Dayton v.  Peck, Stow  and\n                                                                 \n\nWilcox Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439059\"><a href=\"/opinion/439059/david-dayton-v-peck-stow-and-wilcox-co-pexto/\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 692 (1st Cir. 1984), we identified four\n          \n\nsituations in which successor liability is appropriate:  when the\n\nbuyer  agrees to  assume liability;  when  a consolidation  or de\n\nfacto merger occurs; when  the buyer is merely a  continuation of\n\nthe  seller;  and  when the  transaction  is  a  fraud to  escape\n\nliability.  \n\n          We have  already determined  that Boston Gas,  and Lynn\n\nGas  before it, did not  agree to assume environmental liability.\n\nFurthermore, there is no allegation of fraud in  this case.  Only\n\nthe merger  and continuation situations remain to bind Boston Gas\n\nas successor to the gas liabilities in this case.   There was, of\n\ncourse,  no formal  merger  by which  Lynn Gas  Co. --  and later\n\nBoston  Gas -- assumed the  liabilities of Lynn  Gas and Electric\n\nCo., so appellants  would have to prove a de  facto merger claim.\n\nCentral  to a  de  facto merger  or  continuation of  the  seller\n\ncorporation  claim, however,  is  a  finding  that  shareholders,\n\nofficers and directors continued into the buyer corporation.  Id.\n                                                                 \n\nat 693.  Boston Gas, however, did not share any such  continuity.\n\nThe  successor corporation  doctrine  actually supports  imposing\n\nliability on  appellants, as the requisite  continuity existed in\n\ntheir corporate structures.\n\n                               -17-\n\n          Appellants also argue that  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 164    98\n\nrequires  the  assumption  by  Boston Gas  of  the  environmental\n\nliabilities at issue here.  That brief statute states that \"[t]he\n\npurchasing  or consolidated company shall . . . be subject to all\n\nthe duties, liabilities and  restrictions, of the company selling\n\nor merged  as aforesaid, so  far as  they are  applicable to  the\n\npurchasing or  consolidated company.\"   The district  court found\n\nthat  the statute  simply serves  to allocate  the rights  of the\n\npublic  with respect to the  utilities, and does  not curtail the\n\nrights  of  contracting parties  to  allocate  ultimate liability\n\nbetween themselves.\n\n          We find no error in the district court's interpretation\n\nof   98.  The documents transferring the gas business to Lynn Gas\n\nCo. and  later selling Lynn Gas  Co. to Boston Gas  both refer to\n\n  98.  The documents proceed to list the present liabilities owed\n\nby  the companies to customers  and other members  of the public.\n\nThe  parties thus  understood  the statute  to allocate  certain,\n\nexisting liabilities only.  The liabilities at issue in this case\n\nare not among them.\n\n          Finally,  appellants argue that  equity requires Boston\n\nGas  to share  in  the cost  of  the cleanup.    We find  nothing\n\ninequitable  in  imposing  those   costs  solely  on  appellants,\n\nhowever.    The policy  underlying CERCLA  --  to make  those who\n\nbefouled  the  environment  responsible  for its  cleanup  --  is\n\ncertainly  equitable.  See  Dedham Water, 805  F.2d at  1081.  We\n                                        \n\nhave found that appellants were the proper responsible parties in\n\n                               -18-\n\nthis case, and it is equitable for them to clean up the property.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -19-\n</pre>",
