This appeal stems from a dispute\n\nbetween Insituform Technologies, Inc. (\"Insituform\"), a Missouri-\n\nbased contractor, and American Home Assurance Company (\"American\n\nHome\"), an insurer that issued an \"excess umbrella\" policy to\n\nInsituform.     The dispute centers on the reading of the policy in\n\nrelation to an underlying primary coverage policy issued by another\n\ninsurer.     The background events are easily recounted.\n\n             Insituform entered into a subcontract with D'Alessandro\n\nCorporation to rehabilitate roughly 5,400 feet of an East Boston\n\nsewer owned by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (\"MWRA\")\n\nusing cured-in-place pipe technology.              The project called for\n\ninstalling a tube within the existing MWRA pipe and heating resins\n\nto cure the tube; this is said to be less costly than replacing the\n\nexisting pipe.       Insituform performed the installation between\n\nAugust and September 2003.\n\n             The tube had fins and wrinkles, and Insituform trimmed\n\nthe fins at MWRA's request.         There was leakage from both the fins\n\nthat   had   been   trimmed   and   elsewhere.         Ultimately    MWRA   told\n\nInsituform that the work did not meet contract specifications and\n\nhad to be repaired or replaced.              On what was originally a $1\n\nmillion    subcontract,   Insituform        incurred   expenses     of   over   $7\n\nmillion in attempted repair and, when its repair efforts were\n\nunsuccessful, replacing the pipe.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          Insituform filed claims with both Liberty Mutual (its\n\nprimary insurer) and American Home, seeking coverage of the repair\n\nand replacement costs.     Liberty Mutual had issued Insituform a\n\ncommercial general liability (\"CGL\") policy for the relevant time\n\nperiod; it determined that the MWRA repair work was covered under\n\nits policy and paid its applicable policy limit, $1 million less a\n\n$250,000 deductible.   American Home denied coverage, citing policy\n\nexclusions for Insituform's work and product.\n\n          CGL policies are primarily directed at liability sought\n\nto be imposed by a third party and often exclude coverage for\n\nmistakes in the insured's own product or work.          See Am. Home\n\nAssurance Co. v. AGM Marine Contractors, Inc., 467 F.3d 810, 812-13\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).   The Liberty Mutual policy had a number of such\n\nexclusions (e.g., for \"your product\" and \"your work\" and for recall\n\nor replacement of \"your product\" or \"your work\").      But the policy\n\ncontained--among   many   separately   paginated   amendments   (called\n\nendorsements)--one titled \"contractor rework coverage amendment\"\n\nwhich overrode those exclusions to provide coverage in this case\n\n(or so Liberty Mutual concluded).1\n\n\n\n     1\n      The amendment states in relevant part: \"We will pay those\nsums which you become legally obligated to pay for the required\nremoval or repair of 'your product' or 'your work' including\nconcrete, cement, sand or aggregate, concrete blocks, concrete\nproducts or other products manufactured, sold, handled or\ndistributed by or on behalf of the Insured which are defective,\nsubject to the limits of liability and deductible and the\nprovisions specified below.\"\n\n                                 -3-\n\f            American Home's policy is also of the CGL variety,\n\nalthough    seemingly   framed   primarily   to   provide   second-layer\n\ncoverage for damages exceeding the maximum allowed by underlying\n\nprimary policies.    In many respects the coverage and exclusions of\n\nthe American Home policy echoed those of the Liberty Mutual policy.\n\nBut the American Home policy did not include a \"contractor rework\n\ncoverage amendment\" or other amendments comparable to the one\n\nincluded in the Liberty Mutual policy.\n\n            After American Home denied coverage, Insituform filed\n\nsuit in the Massachusetts district court seeking damages for breach\n\nof contract (count I), a declaratory judgment that the policy\n\nprovides coverage (count II) and attorney's fees under Missouri law\n\n(count III), Mo. Rev. Stat. § 375.420 (2002). On cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment, the district court held American Home liable for\n\nthe cost of repairing and replacing Insituform's work but later\n\ndenied     consequential   damages     due   to   inadequate   discovery\n\ndisclosures.    Insituform Techs., Inc. v. Am. Home Assurance Co.,\n\n364 F. Supp. 2d 3 (D. Mass. 2005).\n\n            The parties then stipulated to the amount of compensatory\n\ndamages ($6,054,899.68), which the district court awarded together\n\nwith   prejudgment   interest    ($1,628,917.36).     On    this   appeal,\n\nAmerican Home challenges the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment as to coverage as well as its calculation of prejudgment\n\ninterest. Insituform cross-appeals as to the amount of prejudgment\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\finterest, and it claims that it should have been permitted to\n\npresent evidence of consequential damages.\n\n            We review de novo the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Special Olympics Int'l, Inc.,\n\n346 F.3d 259, 261 (1st Cir. 2003).                      The parties agree that\n\nrelevant law in Missouri and Massachusetts is similar, and we\n\naccept this view as reasonable.               Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co.\n\nv. IDC Props., Inc., 547 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 2008).                      The insured\n\nmust show coverage under the policy; the insurer, the applicability\n\nof any exclusion on which it relies.               E.g., Highlands Ins. Co. v.\n\nAerovox Inc., 676 N.E.2d 801, 804 (Mass. 1997).\n\n            As the case has been framed, American Home seems to\n\nconcede that at least some portion of the MWRA repair and rework\n\ncost constitutes \"property damage\" falling within the broad initial\n\ncoverage    terms      of    its    policy    unless    otherwise    excluded;     and\n\nInsituform appears to concede that the \"your product,\" \"your work\"\n\nand related exclusions in the American Home policy would in turn\n\ndefeat the property damage coverage--save for a separate amendment\n\nin the American Home policy invoked by Insituform.\n\n            That separate amendment to the American Home policy, the\n\nsubject    of   most    of    the    controversy       in   this   case,    is   titled\n\n\"contractor's endorsement.\"            The endorsement is a single page that\n\nreads as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\f                      CONTRACTOR'S ENDORSEMENT\n                          Excluded Hazards\n\nThis insurance does not apply to:\n\n1.

Bodily Injury or Property Damage arising out of any\n          professional services performed by or on behalf of the\n          Insured, including but not limited to the preparation or\n          approval of maps, plans, opinions, reports, surveys,\n          designs   or  specifications,   and   any   supervisory,\n          inspection or engineering services.\n\nFollowing Form Hazards\n\nIt is further agreed that this insurance does not apply to:\n\n1.        Property Damage arising out of:\n\n          a.     Blasting or explosion other than the explosion of\n                 air or steam vessels, piping under pressure,\n                 prime movers, machinery or power transmitting\n                 equipment;\n\n          b.     The collapse of or structural       injury   to   any\n                 building or structure due to:\n\n                 1)      the grading of land, paving, excavating,\n                         drilling, burrowing, filling, back-filling,\n                         tunneling, pile driving, coffer-dam or\n                         caisson work,\n\n                 2)      the moving, shoring, underpinning, raising,\n                         or demolition of any building or structure,\n                         or the removal or rebuilding of any\n                         structural support thereof, or\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f           c.

Any liability assumed by the Insured under any contract\n           or agreement.\n\nHowever, if insurance for such Bodily Injury or Property Damage is\nprovided by a policy listed in the Schedule of Underlying\nInsurance:\n\n1.         This exclusion shall not apply; and\n\n2.         The insurance provided by our policy will not be broader\n           than the insurance coverage provided by the policy listed\n           in the Schedule of Underlying Insurance.\n\nAll other terms and conditions of this policy remain unchanged.\n\n           The district court held that the endorsement is ambiguous\n\nas   to   whether   the   \"However\"   provision   governs    the   entire\n\nendorsement or merely the portion of the endorsement that follows\n\nthe subheading titled \"Following Form Hazards.\"             Arguably the\n\nendorsement is ambiguous on this point and so should be read in\n\nfavor of the insured.      Hakim v. Mass. Insurers' Insolvency Fund,\n\n675 N.E.2d 1161, 1165 (Mass. 1997).     If so, none of the exclusions\n\nin the endorsement would apply if insurance for the listed harms\n\nwere provided in the underlying Liberty Mutual policy.\n\n           But what the district court said next--which we do not\n\naccept--is that wherever Liberty Mutual provided coverage under its\n\nown policy for hazards described in the endorsement, American Home\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fbecame liable for excess damages under the American Home policy (up\n\nto its own policy limit) for the same hazards.        The district\n\ncourt's reasoning is nicely summed up in the following statement by\n\nthe district judge:\n\n          Accordingly, as proposed by Insituform, I\n          construe the However clause in Endorsement No.\n          4 [the American Home contractor's endorsement]\n          to modify both the Excluded Hazards and the\n          Following Form Hazards sections of the\n          endorsement.     Consequently, those hazards\n          \"follow form\" (as that term is used in the\n          parties' submissions) to the primary insurance\n          policy issued by Liberty Mutual Insurance\n          Company to Insituform, as it is uncontroverted\n          that the Liberty policy is \"a policy listed in\n          the Schedule of Underlying Insurance.\"2\n\nInsituform, 364 F. Supp. 2d at 6.\n\n          The \"accordingly\" (as already noted) may well be sound\n\nbut we think the \"consequently\" is not.      The district court's\n\n\"consequently\" and the \"follow form\" references rest on a half-\n\nburied premise that is contrary to the language of the American\n\n\n\n     2\n      In granting summary judgment as to liability, the district\njudge repeated: \"Endorsement No. 4 follows form . . . to the extent\nthat the Liberty Mutual policy provides coverage for the specific\ntypes of hazards explicitly listed in the Endorsement--that is, a\nclaim must fall within one of the eight enumerated hazards, matched\nto a similar provision in the primary policy, in order to be\ncovered by the American Home policy. The crucial inquiries, then,\nare whether the MWRA Claim fits within any of the hazards listed in\nEndorsement No. 4, and whether Liberty Mutual's Rework Coverage\nAmendment   provides   coverage   for   that  particular   hazard.\"\nInsituform, 2007 WL 2900469, at *3.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fHome policy and its contractor's endorsement.   Why the premise is\n\nmistaken is argued by American Home only late in its brief on\n\nappeal and after other complex arguments, which may also explain\n\nwhy the premise was not focused upon by the district court; but the\n\nargument against the premise was fully preserved in the district\n\ncourt and is decisive in favor of American Home.\n\n          The phrase \"follow form\" refers to the practice, common\n\nin excess policies, of having the second-layer coverage follow\n\nsubstantively the primary layer provided by the main insurer, 2\n\nOstrager & Newman, Handbook on Insurance Coverage Disputes, § 13.01\n\n(11th ed. 2002), and it would be easy to write a short excess\n\npolicy that adopted all of the terms of the primary (except that\n\ncoverage cuts in after the primary layer is exhausted and cuts off\n\nat the excess policy limit).   But \"follow form\" is a loose term,\n\nand the American Home policy does not by any means \"follow [the]\n\nform\" of the Liberty Mutual policy in all respects.3\n\n          Rather, the American Home policy--although it provides\n\nmuch secondary coverage in relation to Liberty Mutual--has a\n\nlengthy set of coverage provisions and exclusions of its own. Many\n\nof the American Home provisions, for and against coverage, mirror\n\n\n\n     3\n      Various phrases are used to describe second-layer policies,\namong them \"umbrella,\" \"excess\" and \"follow form,\" but it is a\nmistake to assume precision in such terminology; and even where a\npolicy is described as \"follow form,\" it does not necessarily\nprovide coverage that is substantively identical to the underlying\none. Ostrager & Newman, supra, § 13.01.\n\n                               -9-\n\fthose of the Liberty Mutual policy.             But--and this is critical\n\nhere--the    American   Home   policy       contains    the   Liberty   Mutual\n\nexclusions    for   \"your    product\"   and     \"your    work\"   and    related\n\nliabilities, but it does not contain the Liberty Mutual \"contractor\n\nrework coverage amendment\" (note 1, above) that overrides those\n\nexclusions as to Liberty Mutual.\n\n            The   district   court   read     the   However   clause    in   the\n\nAmerican Home contractors endorsement as if it made American Home\n\nliable for any of the hazards listed in the endorsement wherever\n\nLiberty Mutual would be liable for the same hazard.              Thus, on the\n\ndistrict court's reading, because hazard 2 in the endorsement\n\nrelates to property damage and Liberty Mutual's policy covers such\n\ndamage under the \"contractor rework coverage amendment,\" American\n\nHome is liable to provide secondary coverage for the rework.\n\n            But the American Home contractors endorsement does not\n\ncreate new liability for American Home inconsistent with its other\n\nbasic coverage and exclusion provisions.               On the contrary, the\n\nAmerican Home endorsement at issue (in contrast to the Liberty\n\nMutual endorsement which expands liability) negates liability for\n\nthe named hazards over and above existing exclusions elsewhere.\n\nThe only role of the However clause is to limit these new negations\n\nwherever Liberty Mutual would provide coverage.\n\n            American Home need not and arguably cannot rely on the\n\nendorsement to its policy to defeat Insituform's claim: it can and\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fclearly does rely on the \"your product\" and \"your work\" exclusions\n\nof its own policy which, unlike the Liberty Mutual policy, are not\n\noverridden by the contractor's rework coverage amendment to which\n\nLiberty Mutual (but not American Home) consented. Insituform makes\n\nno effort to show that the your product and your work exclusions\n\nare inapplicable. Its reliance on the rework amendment--which only\n\napplies to \"your work\" or \"your product\"--implicitly recognizes\n\nthat they would apply but for the endorsement.\n\n          On point is United National Ins. Co. v. Hydro Tank, Inc.,\n\n497 F.3d 445, amended on other grounds by 525 F.3d 400 (5th Cir.\n\n2007),   which   also    dealt   with    an   excess   policy's   limiting\n\nendorsement that itself contained a savings clause akin to the\n\nHowever clause here.4      The Fifth Circuit crisply dispatched an\n\ninsured's claim parallel to that of Insituform, saying (as we do)\n\nthat the savings clause created an exception to the exclusions in\n\nthe endorsement but did not override exclusions contained elsewhere\n\nin the same policy.     Id. at 452.     The policy language in Hydro Tank\n\nwas different; the principle is the same.\n\n          In an effort to get around this result, Insituform points\n\nto other uses of the However clause elsewhere in the American Home\n\n\n     4\n      The contractors limitation endorsement in the excess policy\nexcluded contractually assumed liability \"except insofar as\ncoverage is available to the insured in valid and collectible\n'underlying insurance' . . . .\" The underlying insurance did cover\nthe harm; but the court held that the \"insofar as\" qualifier left\nintact a separate exclusion in the excess policy for pollution-\nrelated harm.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fpolicy that it says are designed to create new coverage; in\n\nparticular, it says that endorsement no. 7, which governs employee\n\nbenefit liability, uses a However clause to create coverage that\n\nfollows form to a similar endorsement in the underlying Liberty\n\nMutual policy. It says that reading that endorsement as limited by\n\nthe American Home policy exclusions would make it meaningless.\n\n           Even if this other endorsement were taken to cast light\n\non the contractor's endorsement, it does not cast the light that\n\nInsituform attributes to it.          Insituform is not correct that\n\nendorsement no. 7 would be meaningless if limited by American Home\n\npolicy's other exclusions.         Endorsement no. 7 creates limited\n\nfollow form coverage for negligent administration of such programs;\n\nthe   exclusions,    in   contrast,   defeat    coverage     for   violating\n\nobligations imposed by the benefit laws themselves and are not\n\ninconsistent with coverage created by endorsement no. 7.\n\n           Our discussion renders as beside the point the parties'\n\nlengthy discussion as to whether the harm in this case is within or\n\nwithout one or another of the listed hazards in the American Home\n\ncontractor's endorsement.         This would matter here only if the\n\nendorsement   were    read   to    override    independent     restrictions\n\nelsewhere in the policy.          Such a reading is not tenable and\n\nAmerican Home is not liable for the rework.         This also means that\n\nthe interest and consequential damages issues are moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f          The judgment of the district court is vacated and the\n\ncase remanded for dismissal of the complaint.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                         -13-\n\f",

This appeal stems from a dispute\n\nbetween Insituform Technologies, Inc. (\"Insituform\"), a Missouri-\n\nbased contractor, and American Home Assurance Company (\"American\n\nHome\"), an insurer that issued an \"excess umbrella\" policy to\n\nInsituform.     The dispute centers on the reading of the policy in\n\nrelation to an underlying primary coverage policy issued by another\n\ninsurer.     The background events are easily recounted.\n\n             Insituform entered into a subcontract with D'Alessandro\n\nCorporation to rehabilitate roughly 5,400 feet of an East Boston\n\nsewer owned by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (\"MWRA\")\n\nusing cured-in-place pipe technology.              The project called for\n\ninstalling a tube within the existing MWRA pipe and heating resins\n\nto cure the tube; this is said to be less costly than replacing the\n\nexisting pipe.       Insituform performed the installation between\n\nAugust and September 2003.\n\n             The tube had fins and wrinkles, and Insituform trimmed\n\nthe fins at MWRA's request.         There was leakage from both the fins\n\nthat   had   been   trimmed   and   elsewhere.         Ultimately    MWRA   told\n\nInsituform that the work did not meet contract specifications and\n\nhad to be repaired or replaced.              On what was originally a $1\n\nmillion    subcontract,   Insituform        incurred   expenses     of   over   $7\n\nmillion in attempted repair and, when its repair efforts were\n\nunsuccessful, replacing the pipe.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          Insituform filed claims with both Liberty Mutual (its\n\nprimary insurer) and American Home, seeking coverage of the repair\n\nand replacement costs.     Liberty Mutual had issued Insituform a\n\ncommercial general liability (\"CGL\") policy for the relevant time\n\nperiod; it determined that the MWRA repair work was covered under\n\nits policy and paid its applicable policy limit, $1 million less a\n\n$250,000 deductible.   American Home denied coverage, citing policy\n\nexclusions for Insituform's work and product.\n\n          CGL policies are primarily directed at liability sought\n\nto be imposed by a third party and often exclude coverage for\n\nmistakes in the insured's own product or work.          See Am. Home\n\nAssurance Co. v. AGM Marine Contractors, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 812-13\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).   The Liberty Mutual policy had a number of such\n\nexclusions (e.g., for \"your product\" and \"your work\" and for recall\n\nor replacement of \"your product\" or \"your work\").      But the policy\n\ncontained--among   many   separately   paginated   amendments   (called\n\nendorsements)--one titled \"contractor rework coverage amendment\"\n\nwhich overrode those exclusions to provide coverage in this case\n\n(or so Liberty Mutual concluded).1\n\n\n\n     1\n      The amendment states in relevant part: \"We will pay those\nsums which you become legally obligated to pay for the required\nremoval or repair of 'your product' or 'your work' including\nconcrete, cement, sand or aggregate, concrete blocks, concrete\nproducts or other products manufactured, sold, handled or\ndistributed by or on behalf of the Insured which are defective,\nsubject to the limits of liability and deductible and the\nprovisions specified below.\"\n\n                                 -3-\n\f            American Home's policy is also of the CGL variety,\n\nalthough    seemingly   framed   primarily   to   provide   second-layer\n\ncoverage for damages exceeding the maximum allowed by underlying\n\nprimary policies.    In many respects the coverage and exclusions of\n\nthe American Home policy echoed those of the Liberty Mutual policy.\n\nBut the American Home policy did not include a \"contractor rework\n\ncoverage amendment\" or other amendments comparable to the one\n\nincluded in the Liberty Mutual policy.\n\n            After American Home denied coverage, Insituform filed\n\nsuit in the Massachusetts district court seeking damages for breach\n\nof contract (count I), a declaratory judgment that the policy\n\nprovides coverage (count II) and attorney's fees under Missouri law\n\n(count III), Mo. Rev. Stat. § 375.420 (2002). On cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment, the district court held American Home liable for\n\nthe cost of repairing and replacing Insituform's work but later\n\ndenied     consequential   damages     due   to   inadequate   discovery\n\ndisclosures.

Hakim v. Mass. Insurers' Insolvency Fund,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1165 (Mass. 1997).     If so, none of the exclusions\n\nin the endorsement would apply if insurance for the listed harms\n\nwere provided in the underlying Liberty Mutual policy.\n\n           But what the district court said next--which we do not\n\naccept--is that wherever Liberty Mutual provided coverage under its\n\nown policy for hazards described in the endorsement, American Home\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fbecame liable for excess damages under the American Home policy (up\n\nto its own policy limit) for the same hazards.        The district\n\ncourt's reasoning is nicely summed up in the following statement by\n\nthe district judge:\n\n          Accordingly, as proposed by Insituform, I\n          construe the However clause in Endorsement No.\n          4 [the American Home contractor's endorsement]\n          to modify both the Excluded Hazards and the\n          Following Form Hazards sections of the\n          endorsement.     Consequently, those hazards\n          \"follow form\" (as that term is used in the\n          parties' submissions) to the primary insurance\n          policy issued by Liberty Mutual Insurance\n          Company to Insituform, as it is uncontroverted\n          that the Liberty policy is \"a policy listed in\n          the Schedule of Underlying Insurance.\"2\n\nInsituform, 364 F. Supp. 2d at 6.\n\n          The \"accordingly\" (as already noted) may well be sound\n\nbut we think the \"consequently\" is not.      The district court's\n\n\"consequently\" and the \"follow form\" references rest on a half-\n\nburied premise that is contrary to the language of the American\n\n\n\n     2\n      In granting summary judgment as to liability, the district\njudge repeated: \"Endorsement No. 4 follows form . . . to the extent\nthat the Liberty Mutual policy provides coverage for the specific\ntypes of hazards explicitly listed in the Endorsement--that is, a\nclaim must fall within one of the eight enumerated hazards, matched\nto a similar provision in the primary policy, in order to be\ncovered by the American Home policy. The crucial inquiries, then,\nare whether the MWRA Claim fits within any of the hazards listed in\nEndorsement No. 4, and whether Liberty Mutual's Rework Coverage\nAmendment   provides   coverage   for   that  particular   hazard.\"\nInsituform, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2900469</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fHome policy and its contractor's endorsement.   Why the premise is\n\nmistaken is argued by American Home only late in its brief on\n\nappeal and after other complex arguments, which may also explain\n\nwhy the premise was not focused upon by the district court; but the\n\nargument against the premise was fully preserved in the district\n\ncourt and is decisive in favor of American Home.\n\n          The phrase \"follow form\" refers to the practice, common\n\nin excess policies, of having the second-layer coverage follow\n\nsubstantively the primary layer provided by the main insurer, 2\n\nOstrager & Newman, Handbook on Insurance Coverage Disputes, § 13.01\n\n(11th ed. 2002), and it would be easy to write a short excess\n\npolicy that adopted all of the terms of the primary (except that\n\ncoverage cuts in after the primary layer is exhausted and cuts off\n\nat the excess policy limit).   But \"follow form\" is a loose term,\n\nand the American Home policy does not by any means \"follow [the]\n\nform\" of the Liberty Mutual policy in all respects.3\n\n          Rather, the American Home policy--although it provides\n\nmuch secondary coverage in relation to Liberty Mutual--has a\n\nlengthy set of coverage provisions and exclusions of its own. Many\n\nof the American Home provisions, for and against coverage, mirror\n\n\n\n     3\n      Various phrases are used to describe second-layer policies,\namong them \"umbrella,\" \"excess\" and \"follow form,\" but it is a\nmistake to assume precision in such terminology; and even where a\npolicy is described as \"follow form,\" it does not necessarily\nprovide coverage that is substantively identical to the underlying\none. Ostrager & Newman, supra, § 13.01.\n\n                               -9-\n\fthose of the Liberty Mutual policy.             But--and this is critical\n\nhere--the    American   Home   policy       contains    the   Liberty   Mutual\n\nexclusions    for   \"your    product\"   and     \"your    work\"   and    related\n\nliabilities, but it does not contain the Liberty Mutual \"contractor\n\nrework coverage amendment\" (note 1, above) that overrides those\n\nexclusions as to Liberty Mutual.\n\n            The   district   court   read     the   However   clause    in   the\n\nAmerican Home contractors endorsement as if it made American Home\n\nliable for any of the hazards listed in the endorsement wherever\n\nLiberty Mutual would be liable for the same hazard.              Thus, on the\n\ndistrict court's reading, because hazard 2 in the endorsement\n\nrelates to property damage and Liberty Mutual's policy covers such\n\ndamage under the \"contractor rework coverage amendment,\" American\n\nHome is liable to provide secondary coverage for the rework.\n\n            But the American Home contractors endorsement does not\n\ncreate new liability for American Home inconsistent with its other\n\nbasic coverage and exclusion provisions.               On the contrary, the\n\nAmerican Home endorsement at issue (in contrast to the Liberty\n\nMutual endorsement which expands liability) negates liability for\n\nthe named hazards over and above existing exclusions elsewhere.\n\nThe only role of the However clause is to limit these new negations\n\nwherever Liberty Mutual would provide coverage.\n\n            American Home need not and arguably cannot rely on the\n\nendorsement to its policy to defeat Insituform's claim: it can and\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fclearly does rely on the \"your product\" and \"your work\" exclusions\n\nof its own policy which, unlike the Liberty Mutual policy, are not\n\noverridden by the contractor's rework coverage amendment to which\n\nLiberty Mutual (but not American Home) consented. Insituform makes\n\nno effort to show that the your product and your work exclusions\n\nare inapplicable. Its reliance on the rework amendment--which only\n\napplies to \"your work\" or \"your product\"--implicitly recognizes\n\nthat they would apply but for the endorsement.\n\n          On point is United National Ins.

Id. at 452.     The policy language in Hydro Tank\n\nwas different; the principle is the same.\n\n          In an effort to get around this result, Insituform points\n\nto other uses of the However clause elsewhere in the American Home\n\n\n     4\n      The contractors limitation endorsement in the excess policy\nexcluded contractually assumed liability \"except insofar as\ncoverage is available to the insured in valid and collectible\n'underlying insurance' . . . .\" The underlying insurance did cover\nthe harm; but the court held that the \"insofar as\" qualifier left\nintact a separate exclusion in the excess policy for pollution-\nrelated harm.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fpolicy that it says are designed to create new coverage; in\n\nparticular, it says that endorsement no. 7, which governs employee\n\nbenefit liability, uses a However clause to create coverage that\n\nfollows form to a similar endorsement in the underlying Liberty\n\nMutual policy. It says that reading that endorsement as limited by\n\nthe American Home policy exclusions would make it meaningless.\n\n           Even if this other endorsement were taken to cast light\n\non the contractor's endorsement, it does not cast the light that\n\nInsituform attributes to it.          Insituform is not correct that\n\nendorsement no. 7 would be meaningless if limited by American Home\n\npolicy's other exclusions.         Endorsement no. 7 creates limited\n\nfollow form coverage for negligent administration of such programs;\n\nthe   exclusions,    in   contrast,   defeat    coverage     for   violating\n\nobligations imposed by the benefit laws themselves and are not\n\ninconsistent with coverage created by endorsement no. 7.\n\n           Our discussion renders as beside the point the parties'\n\nlengthy discussion as to whether the harm in this case is within or\n\nwithout one or another of the listed hazards in the American Home\n\ncontractor's endorsement.         This would matter here only if the\n\nendorsement   were    read   to    override    independent     restrictions\n\nelsewhere in the policy.          Such a reading is not tenable and\n\nAmerican Home is not liable for the rework.         This also means that\n\nthe interest and consequential damages issues are moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f          The judgment of the district court is vacated and the\n\ncase remanded for dismissal of the complaint.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                         -13-\n\f</pre>",
