In No. 93-1405, we do so substantially\n\nfor  the reasons  articulated by  the district  court in  its\n\ncomprehensive trio of  decisions.  We add only  that, even if\n\nplaintiff had a right under  Louisiana law to appeal from the\n\nextradition order, see, e.g., State v. Hegwood, 510 So.2d 380\n                                              \n\n(La. 1987); State v. Morales,  478 So.2d 943 (La.

See\n                                                             \n\ngenerally  McBride v.

It suffices  to conclude,  as explained  by the\n\nMagistrate-Judge  in  his  Report  and  Recommendation,  that\n\ndefendant in any event was under no constitutional obligation\n\nto  affix  a  legend  to   the  mail  it  sent  to  plaintiff\n\ndesignating such correspondence  as \"legal and confidential.\"\n\nPlaintiff's dispute is not with defendant but rather with the\n\nNew Hampshire prison regulations that  govern the opening and\n\nreading of mail received by inmates.  Because the law in this\n\narea  is unsettled,1 our  affirmance is without  prejudice to\n\nplaintiff filing a separate action against appropriate prison\n\nofficials challenging such regulations. \n\n     The judgments are affirmed.\n                                \n\n                    \n\n1.
