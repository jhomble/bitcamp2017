Defendant-appellant Town of\n\nGreenfield, acting by and through the Greenfield Middle School\n\nBuilding Committee (\"GMSBC\")(hereinafter referred to collectively\n\nas \"Greenfield\"), appeals the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of plaintiff-appellee Seaboard Surety Company\n\n(\"Seaboard\") discharging Seaboard from liability on a construction\n\nperformance bond.      After careful review, we affirm.\n\n                                 I.     Background\n\n          We     summarize       the    lengthy    narrative    of   the     failed\n\nrelationship     between    the       parties,    relating   only    those    facts\n\nrelevant to our review.          On June 18, 1998, Greenfield contracted\n\nwith Interstate Construction Company (\"ICC\") to renovate its Middle\n\nSchool building.     ICC provided the performance bond required by\n\nMassachusetts law, with Seaboard as surety. The bond is a standard\n\nperformance bond, Form A312, issued by the American Institute of\n\nArchitects in 1984.     It provides that the Contractor (ICC) and the\n\nSurety (Seaboard), jointly and severally, bind themselves to the\n\nOwner   (Greenfield)       for    the    performance    of     the   Construction\n\nContract, which the bond incorporates by reference.\n\n           Paragraph 3 of the bond provides that the surety's\n\nobligation under the bond arises after:\n\n           3.1      The Owner has notified the Contractor\n                    and the Surety . . . that the Owner is\n                    considering declaring a Contractor\n                    Default and has requested and attempted\n                    to arrange a conference with the\n                    Contractor and the Surety to be held\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                 not later than fifteen days after\n                 receipt of such notice to discuss\n                 methods of performing the Construction\n                 Contract. If the Owner, the Contractor\n                 and the Surety agree, the Contractor\n                 shall be allowed a reasonable time to\n                 perform the Construction Contract, but\n                 such an agreement shall not waive the\n                 Owner's right, if any, subsequently to\n                 declare a Contractor Default; and\n\n          3.2    The Owner has declared a Contractor\n                 Default and formally terminated the\n                 Contractor's right to complete the\n                 contract.    Such Contractor Default\n                 shall not be declared earlier than\n                 twenty days after the Contractor and\n                 the Surety have received notice as\n                 provided in Subparagraph 3.1; and\n\n          3.3    The Owner has agreed to pay the Balance\n                 of the Contract Price to the Surety in\n                 accordance with the terms of the\n                 Construction    Contract   or    to   a\n                 contractor selected to perform the\n                 Construction Contract in accordance\n                 with the terms of the contract with the\n                 Owner.\n\nOnce the owner has complied with the provisions of Paragraph 3, and\n\nthe surety's obligations are triggered, Paragraph 4 provides that\n\nthe surety \"shall promptly and at the Surety's expense\" take one of\n\na list of specified \"actions.\"    The action at issue in this case,\n\nas described in subparagraph 4.2, is to \"[u]ndertake to perform and\n\ncomplete the Construction Contract itself, through its agents or\n\nthrough independent contractors.\"\n\n          Paragraph 5 provides that \"[i]f the Surety does not\n\nproceed as provided in Paragraph 4 with reasonable promptness, the\n\nSurety shall be deemed to be in default on the Bond fifteen days\n\n                                 -3-\n\fafter receipt of an additional written notice from the Owner to the\n\nSurety demanding that the Surety perform its obligations under this\n\nBond, and the Owner shall be entitled to enforce any remedy\n\navailable to the Owner.\"\n\n           In compliance with subparagraph 3.1, Greenfield notified\n\nICC and Seaboard on November 12, 1998, and again on March 23, 2000,\n\nthat it    was    considering    declaring    a    Contractor    Default.      On\n\nAugust    24,    2000,   after   continuous       struggle    regarding     ICC's\n\ntardiness, Greenfield sent ICC a notice of default and termination\n\nand filed suit in state court.       That same day, Greenfield notified\n\nSeaboard of ICC's termination and agreed to pay the balance of the\n\ncontract price to Seaboard or to a replacement contractor, as\n\nrequired by Paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 of the bond.\n\n            On August 25, 2000, Seaboard responded, asserting its\n\nneed for a reasonable time to investigate, requesting documentation\n\nof ICC's default, and reminding Greenfield of the owner's duty to\n\nmitigate   the    surety's   damages.        Greenfield      hired    an   Interim\n\nConstruction       Management     Consultant,        Baybutt         Construction\n\nCorporation (\"Baybutt\"), to evaluate and to advise the town on the\n\nemergency work needed in the interim. Greenfield notified Seaboard\n\nthat moisture had caused the subflooring of the new floors to\n\nbuckle and the carpets to detach, and that the allocation of\n\nresponsibility      for this damage (between Greenfield and ICC) was\n\nalready before the state court.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f            On September 26, 2000, Greenfield sent Seaboard further\n\ndocumentation regarding ICC's termination and \"formally ask[ed] the\n\nsurety to undertake to perform and complete the construction\n\nitself, or through its agents or independent contractors as set\n\nforth in the surety contract, paragraph 4.2,\" with a response\n\nrequested from Seaboard by October 20, 2000, so that work might\n\nbegin by November 4, 2000.\n\n            On October 11, 2000, representatives of Greenfield, ICC,\n\nand Seaboard met.         Seaboard agreed to prepare a proposal by\n\nOctober 18th addressing the emergency work.               After some delay,\n\nSeaboard delivered a proposal to perform the emergency work -- not\n\nincluding the floor remediation – stating that this was not an\n\noffer to perform under the bond because ICC's termination remained\n\ncontested and Seaboard was still investigating its position with\n\nrespect to the completion of the project and the remediation of the\n\nfloors.\n\n            On October 31, 2000, Greenfield and Seaboard signed an\n\nEmergency    Work    Agreement   to    mitigate   both    parties'   damages.\n\nSeaboard    agreed   to   perform     the   emergency    work,   beginning   on\n\nNovember 6th and finishing by December 31st, for which Greenfield\n\nwould pay $207,000.       Seaboard hired a Construction Manager, Wayne\n\nSheridan, for the emergency work.\n\n            On November 15, 2000, Greefield's attorney faxed three\n\nletters to Seaboard's attorney.         The first conveyed the conclusion\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fof Greenfield's interim consultant, Baybutt, that work would need\n\nto be commenced by December 1st for the building to be ready for\n\nschool    the    next   fall.    Estimated    costs,     including   moisture\n\nremediation, were $5.6 million -- $3.8 million more than the\n\nremaining contract funds. The second letter informed Seaboard that\n\nthe    Building     Committee   had   approached   the    Town   Council    to\n\nappropriate these funds \"if Seaboard declines to complete\" and\n\ninsisted again that work needed to commence by early December. The\n\nthird letter demanded that Seaboard \"soon decide if it will honor\n\nits obligations . . . under the performance bond and complete the\n\nproject.\"      This letter reiterated the necessity that work begin by\n\nearly December and asked Seaboard to commit by November 20th.\n\n               On November 20, 2000, Seaboard responded that, while its\n\ninvestigation of ICC's termination continued, Seaboard was \"willing\n\nto perform the remedial and contract work,\" and was \"prepared to\n\ntake     all    necessary   action    to    expeditiously     arrive   at    a\n\ncomprehensive agreement with [Greenfield] so that the remedial and\n\ncontract work can be commenced as soon as possible.\"                 Seaboard\n\nrequested further documentation regarding the floor remediation\n\nwork.\n\n               On November 21, 2000, Greenfield sent Seaboard further\n\ndocumentation and, on November 22nd, objected to the Town being\n\nrequired to pay for the entire cost of the floor remediation.\n\nWhile the allocation of responsibility for the floors was still in\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fdispute, Greenfield offered to split the costs, under reservation\n\nof rights.     Greenfield also expressed concern about Seaboard's\n\nmanagement team and timely completion.          Greenfield was concerned\n\nthat Seaboard's project manager, Wayne Sheridan, was frequently\n\nabsent from the work site.       Greenfield sought the right to review\n\nand to approve any new project management team.          Greenfield warned\n\nSeaboard that if construction did not begin by December 1st,\n\nGreenfield \"will be compelled to proceed with its other completion\n\noptions.\"\n\n            Eventually, Greenfield acceded, under reservation of\n\nrights, to cover the costs of the floor remediation, and on\n\nDecember 1st, Seaboard sent Greenfield a draft Takeover Agreement.\n\nGreenfield proposed revisions and further negotiations ensued.              On\n\nDecember 8th, Greenfield's attorney notified Seaboard that the\n\nBuilding Committee would meet on December 11th to decide how to\n\nproceed.    On December 11th, Seaboard faxed Greenfield a new draft\n\nof   the    Takeover   Agreement     which    identified     Sheridan,     the\n\nConstruction Manager with whom Greenfield was dissatisfied, as the\n\nproposed Project Manager.        At the Building Committee meeting that\n\nnight, the Committee decided to hire Baybutt to complete the\n\nproject.     The   next   day,   Greenfield   notified     Seaboard   of   the\n\ndecision to proceed without Seaboard's involvement.\n\n            On December 22, 2000, Seaboard filed a complaint in the\n\ndistrict court seeking a declaratory judgment discharging it from\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fobligation     under   the    performance    bond   on     the   grounds   that\n\nGreenfield had materially breached the bond by hiring its own\n\ncontractor.     Seaboard claimed that it had elected to complete the\n\ncontract, as permitted under the bond, but that Greenfield had\n\nrefused to allow the takeover, and that Seaboard was thus denied\n\nthe opportunity to limit its financial exposure.             Greenfield filed\n\ncounterclaims, alleging Seaboard's breach of the bond.                     After\n\ndiscovery, cross motions for summary judgment were filed.\n\n             On March 7, 2003, the district court granted Seaboard's\n\nmotion   for    summary      judgment.       Rejecting     any    anticipatory\n\nrepudiation     defense      for      Greenfield    as     disallowed      under\n\nMassachusetts law, the court held that \"[b]ecause a clear and\n\ndirect default notice was not served pursuant to Paragraph 5, . . .\n\nGreenfield was in material breach of the Bond when it ceased its\n\ndealings with Seaboard and hired another company.\"               Seaboard Sur.\n\nCo. v. Town of Greenfield, 266 F. Supp. 2d 189, 198 (D. Mass.\n\n2003).\n\n                                II.    Analysis\n\n          Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence before\n\nthe court shows \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.\"        Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).            For the purposes of\n\nsummary judgment, \"'genuine' means that 'the evidence is such that\n\na reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party',\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fand a 'material fact' is one which 'might affect the outcome of the\n\nsuit under the governing law.'\"         Hayes v. Douglas Dynamics, Inc.,\n\n8 F.3d 88, 90 (1st Cir. 1993)(quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\n\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)).            We review de novo the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment, viewing the facts and making all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of Greenfield, the nonmoving party.\n\nRodríguez v. Smithkline Beecham, 224 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).              We\n\nmay affirm on any ground supported by the record.                Id.\n\n               The parties agree that Greenfield complied with the\n\nnotice requirements regarding ICC's default provided by Paragraph\n\n3   of   the    performance   bond.     Seaboard    argues,      however,   that\n\nGreenfield failed to provide notice of Seaboard's default before\n\nterminating Seaboard's involvement, as required by Paragraph 5.\n\nGreenfield contends that Seaboard had previously breached the\n\nperformance bond by failing to take prompt action following ICC's\n\ndefault    as     required    by   Paragraph    4   and   that     Greenfield's\n\ncommunications with Seaboard complied with Paragraph 5's notice\n\nrequirements.1\n\n\n\n1\n   Greenfield argues in the alternative that Paragraph 5 does not\nmake notice a condition precedent of surety default but instead\nsimply provides an optional vehicle through which the owner may\nprotect itself from any future claims of the surety. We find this\nreading of Paragraph 5 contrary to the unambiguous language of the\nbond, and, under Massachusetts law, \"when the wording of a contract\nis unambiguous, the terms will be enforced.\" Paterson-Leitch Co.,\nInc. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 991 (1st Cir.\n1988)(citing Edmonds v. United States, 642 F.2d 877, 881 (1st Cir.\n1981)).\n\n                                      -9-\n\f          We find it unnecessary to address Seaboard's compliance\n\nwith Paragraph 4.   The district court examined the evidence on the\n\nissue and denied Greenfield's motion for summary judgment because\n\n\"the Court cannot find as a matter of law that Seaboard committed\n\na material breach of the terms and conditions of the Bond by\n\nfailing to promptly select and undertake action under paragraph 4.\"\n\nSeaboard Sur. Co., 266 F. Supp. 2d at 195.               The district court\n\nopinion ultimately rests, however, on Greenfield's failure to\n\ncomply with    Paragraph   5.         The   district   court    concludes   that\n\nGreenfield's Paragraph 4 claims against Seaboard \"necessarily fail\n\n. . . due to Greenfield's material breach of the Bond,\" and\n\ndescribes Greenfield's breach thus:            \"Because a clear and direct\n\ndefault notice was not served pursuant to Paragraph 5, the Court\n\nfinds that Greenfield was in material breach of the Bond when it\n\nceased its dealings with Seaboard and hired another company to\n\ncomplete the Project.\"     Id. at 198.        The district court therefore\n\nconcludes that \"Greenfield's refusal to allow Seaboard to complete\n\nthe Project renders the Bond null and void and discharges Seaboard\n\nfrom any and all liability under the Bond.\"             Id. (citing St. Paul\n\nFire & Marine Ins. Co. v. City of Green River, 93 F. Supp. 2d 1170\n\n(D. Wyo. 2000), aff'd, 6 Fed. Appx. 828 (10th Cir. 2001)).\n\n          We   agree   with     the    district   court's      conclusion   that\n\nGreenfield's compliance with Paragraph 5 is dispositive of both\n\nparties' claims. Even assuming that Seaboard failed to provide the\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fprompt response to contractor default required by Paragraph 4, the\n\nsurety default provision of Paragraph 5 constitutes an important\n\ncontractual right of the surety.             Paragraph 5 provides the surety\n\nfifteen days during which it may attempt to cure the alleged breach\n\nprior to default and thus to minimize its economic exposure.\n\nFailure to provide this notice constitutes a material breach of the\n\nbond.   School Bd. of Escambia Cty. v. TIG Premier Ins. Co., 110 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1351, 1353 (N.D. Fla. 2000)(\"[F]ailure to adhere to a\n\nperformance bond notification requirement is a material breach,\n\nresulting in the loss of an obligee's rights under the bond.\"); St.\n\nPaul, 93 F. Supp. 2d at 1178 (\"Courts have consistently held that\n\nan obligee's action that deprives a surety of its ability to\n\nprotect itself pursuant to performance options granted under a\n\nperformance bond constitutes a material breach, which renders the\n\nbond null and void.\"); cf. Dragon Constr., Inc. v. Parkway Bank &\n\nTrust, 678 N.E.2d 55, 58 (Ill. App. Ct. 1997)(owner's \"failure to\n\nprovide    adequate    notice   of    [contractor's]       termination   .   .   .\n\nstripped    [surety]    of   its     right    to   limit   its   liability   and\n\nconstituted a material breach of contract which rendered the surety\n\nbonds null and void.\").\n\n            Greenfield seeks refuge in the contention that under\n\nMassachusetts law \"compensated sureties . . . ought not to be\n\nrelieved from their obligations on merely technical grounds, not\n\naffecting substantially the character of the undertaking which they\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fassumed.\"     Bayer & Mingolla Constr. Co, Inc. v. Deschenes, 205\n\nN.E.2d 208, 211 n.4 (Mass. 1965)(quoting Maryland Cas. Co. v.\n\nDunlap, 68 F.2d 289, 291 (1st Cir. 1933)).       While it is true that\n\n\"Massachusetts courts have held that lack of prompt notice to the\n\ncompensated surety of a contractor's default (as required by a\n\nPerformance Bond) does not discharge the surety if it is not\n\nharmed,\" notice requirements \"exist[] precisely to provide the\n\nsurety   an   opportunity   to     protect   itself   against   loss   by\n\nparticipating in the selection of the successor contractor to\n\nensure that the lowest bidder is hired and damages mitigated.\"\n\nEnterprise Capital, Inc. v. San-Gra Corp., 284 F. Supp. 2d 166, 177\n\n(D. Mass. 2003)(citations omitted).          In the context of surety\n\ndefault, the notice provision similarly provides an opportunity for\n\nthe surety to cure the breach and thus mitigate damages.          As the\n\ncourt concluded in Enterprise Capital, \"even if [Seaboard] must\n\nshow injury, loss, or prejudice, it meets this hurdle, given its\n\ndeprivation of mitigation opportunities.\"       Id.\n\n            We must therefore determine whether the record creates a\n\ntriable issue of fact as to Greenfield's compliance with Paragraph\n\n5 of the performance bond.       Paragraph 5 provides that:\n\n            If the Surety does not proceed as provided in\n            Paragraph 4 with reasonable promptness, the\n            Surety will be deemed to be in default on this\n            Bond fifteen days after receipt of an\n            additional written notice from the Owner to\n            the Surety demanding that the Surety perform\n            its obligations under this Bond, and the Owner\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f           shall be entitled to            enforce    any   remedy\n           available to the Owner.\n\nGreenfield contends that several letters it sent to Seaboard, and\n\nparticularly two letters dated November 15th, constituted \"an\n\nadditional written notice . . . demanding that the surety perform\n\nits obligations\" in compliance with Paragraph 5 and that Seaboard\n\nwas thus properly deemed in default fifteen days thereafter and\n\nprior to Greenfield's December 11th decision to hire Baybutt to\n\ncomplete the project.\n\n           We describe and quote these letters at some length, as\n\nour decision rests on whether a reasonable jury could find them to\n\nconstitute the \"additional written notice\" required by Paragraph 5.\n\nThe   first,   dated   September    26,    2000,   responds   in     detail   to\n\nSeaboard's requests for documentation regarding ICC's termination\n\nand concludes thus:\n\n                  Lastly, the Building Committee is\n           formally asking the surety to undertake to\n           perform and complete the construction contract\n           itself, or through its agents or independent\n           contractors as set forth in the surety\n           contract, paragraph 4.2.    Please be further\n           advised that owner believes that they will\n           require a decision by the surety no later than\n           October 20, 2000 so that work may begin in\n           earnest to move forward on the project by\n           November 4, 2000.\n\nTwo   additional   letters   were    sent     to     Seaboard's    counsel    on\n\nNovember 15th.     The first informs Seaboard that Greenfield Middle\n\nSchool Building Committee (\"GMSBC\") has presented a proposal to\n\nobtain additional funding in case Seaboard declines to complete.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fIt then discusses a report prepared by Baybutt indicating that work\n\nmust commence by early December in order for the school to be ready\n\nfor the 2001 school year.       The pertinent paragraphs read:\n\n                 The   GMSBC    believes   Seaboard  has\n          substantial financial exposure to the Town.\n          It would appear that one way for Seaboard to\n          minimize that financial exposure would be to\n          assume performance and complete the contract.\n          The alternative to completion by Seaboard is\n          completion by the GMSBC through a totally\n          different construction team, possibly after\n          receipt of competitive bids.      If the GMSBC\n          must   obtain    competitive   proposals,  the\n          completion costs could rise even higher than\n          Baybutt's estimate.\n                 The    Greenfield    Town   Council  is\n          scheduled to vote on the GMSCB's $4.35 million\n          request for additional funding on November 21,\n          2000.    The GMSBC has asked that Seaboard\n          provide me with a statement of Seaboard's\n          intentions by Monday, November 20, 2000.\n\nThe second letter of November 15th begins thus: \"Seaboard Surety\n\nCo. must soon decide if it will honor its obligations to the\n\nGreenfield    Middle   School   Building   Committee   .    .   .   under   the\n\nperformance bond and complete the project.\"                It explains the\n\nGMSBC's insistence that Seaboard respond promptly:\n\n                    The GMSBC must now decide how it will\n             complete the project. It is still the GMSBC's\n             preference   to   have    Seaboard   complete.\n             Seaboard has been aware of the problems with\n             ICC for several years and Seaboard has had two\n             and one half months since ICC's termination to\n             assess   and   determine   its   position   on\n             completion. The time for Seaboard to make a\n             decision is here.\n                    The GMSBC is concerned by Seaboard's\n             indecision regarding completion of the Project\n             and is concerned that Seaboard may be giving\n             too much credit to ICC's explanations and\n\n                                   -14-\n\f         excuses as to what went wrong on the project.\n         The GMSBC asks that Seaboard undertake an\n         objective review of the facts that culminated\n         in the GMSBC's decision to terminate ICC,\n         before it decides if it will honor its\n         performance bond.\n\nThe letter then presents a detailed explanation of Greenfield's\n\ndecision to terminate ICC.   It concludes thus:\n\n                 The critical issue, at this time, is to\n          determine how the project will be completed.\n          The GMSBC believes it is in the best interests\n          of the Town and Seaboard to work together to\n          complete the Project since a mutual effort\n          will be required to get the school opened as\n          quickly as possible. If there are differences\n          in our positions that cannot immediately be\n          resolved, the GMSBC will entertain the\n          adoption of solutions that will allow the\n          parties to \"agree to disagree\" over those\n          differences,    as    long    as    construction\n          progresses. If Seaboard assumes completion of\n          the Project and adheres to a reasonable\n          construction schedule, the GMSBC's consultants\n          believe that the Project can still be\n          completed before the September 2001 school\n          opening. If, however, the GMSBC is compelled\n          to develop new bid packages and receive\n          competitive   proposals    to    complete,   the\n          increases in project cost and the delay in\n          completion could be even more severe than the\n          GMSBC's current projections.\n                 Should Seaboard decide to honor its\n          performance bond, there will be a substantial\n          amount of work that will need to be completed\n          in a timely manner.     Seaboard will need an\n          experienced project management team on site to\n          carefully direct the work.\n                 Please ask Seaboard to give this matter\n          its immediate and careful consideration. The\n          GMSBC has asked that Seaboard provide it with\n          an   indication    of    its     intentions   by\n          November 20, 2000, since an important vote in\n          the   Town   government    on    financing   the\n          completion of the work, has been scheduled for\n          November 21, 2000.\n\n                               -15-\n\fThe final letter is dated November 22, 2000, and begins thus:\n\n                 The [GMSBC] is somewhat encouraged by\n          your   November   20,    2000    correspondence\n          indicating [Seaboard's] position on completing\n          the Project.    The GMSBC wants Seaboard to\n          complete the Project and is anxious to get the\n          work underway.      However, the GMSBC has\n          concerns with Seaboard's position that the\n          GMSBC must pay for all the costs to remedy the\n          floor damage . . . In addition to resolving\n          the question of who between Seaboard and the\n          GMSBC   pays  what   portion   of    the   floor\n          remediation work, the GMSBC has a number of\n          additional     concerns     that     must     be\n          satisfactorily   addressed    in   a    takeover\n          agreement.\n\nThe letter proceeds to describe the GMSBC's position on the floor\n\nremediation costs and proposes that Seaboard and the GMSBC split\n\nthe costs, reserving their rights against one another and against\n\nICC, until the allocation of responsibility is determined in court.\n\nThe letter then lists and discusses seven \"other key issues that\n\nmust be satisfactorily addressed in any takeover agreement.\"    It\n\nconcludes thus:\n\n                 Please contact me at your earliest\n          opportunity, to discuss Seaboard's position\n          regarding the above issues. The GMSBC would\n          like to be able to reach a general agreement\n          on the issues to be covered in the takeover\n          agreement   by   the  end   of   the   day  on\n          November 27, 2000, with a written takeover\n          agreement to follow a few days thereafter.\n          Should we be able to successfully negotiate a\n          takeover       agreement,       construction\n          representatives of all parties should be\n          prepared to meet on short notice at the site .\n          . . .\n                 Time is truly of the essence in\n          negotiating    a   takeover    agreement   and\n          commencing the completion of the work.     The\n\n                               -16-\n\f             GMSBC has targeted December 1, 2000 as the\n             date by which work on the completion of the\n             contract should commence.      The GMBSC is\n             prepared to do what is necessary to meet that\n             date.   If the takeover agreement cannot be\n             reached, the GMSBC will be compelled to\n             proceed with its other completion options.\n\n             The district court found that none of the letters, taken\n\ntogether or separately, constituted the additional written notice\n\nrequired by Paragraph 5 of the bond, because the letters do not\n\ndemand performance in a manner sufficient to alert Seaboard to a\n\npresumed default,     nor   do   they   indicate   that   Seaboard   was   in\n\nmaterial breach for failing to choose or to undertake performance\n\nwith reasonable promptness, nor do they reference the Paragraph 5\n\ndefault provisions or warn that Seaboard will be deemed in default\n\nin fifteen days.     Seaboard Sur. Co., 266 F. Supp. 2d at 197.            We\n\nagree.\n\n            In the context of contractor default, courts have found\n\nthat \"[a] declaration of default sufficient to invoke the surety's\n\nobligations . . . must be made in clear, direct, and unequivocal\n\nlanguage.\"     L & A Contracting Co. v. S. Concrete Serv., Inc., 17\n\nF.3d 106, 111 (5th Cir. 1994)(finding insufficient notice of\n\ndefault when owner's letters never mentioned the word \"default\");\n\nElm Haven Constr. Ltd. P'ship v. Neri Constr., LLC, 281 F. Supp. 2d\n\n406   (D.   Conn.   2003)   (insufficient    notice   when   letters   only\n\ncomplained about performance and financial status); Balfour Beatty\n\nConstr., Inc. v. Colonial Ornamental Iron Works, Inc., 986 F. Supp.\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f82, 86 (D. Conn. 1997) (insufficient notice when letters only\n\nmention delay in performance).        The district court applied this\n\nstandard in the related context of surety default before us and\n\nconcluded that Greenfield's letters failed to provide \"a clear and\n\ndirect default notice\" to Seaboard.         Seaboard Sur. Co., 266 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 198.\n\n            While the standard for sufficiency of notice applied by\n\nthe   district   court   comports   with   the   general    standard   that\n\n\"[n]otice must be clear, definite, explicit, and unambiguous,\"           58\n\nAm. Jur. 2d Notice § 2, there is no dispute that the performance\n\nbond at issue here is governed by Massachusetts law.             Although\n\nneither party before us nor the decision below suggests that\n\nMassachusetts law provides a relevant standard for sufficiency of\n\nnotice meaningfully distinct from that applied by the district\n\ncourt, we must address the issue.          In introducing the \"clear,\n\ndirect and unequivocal\" standard, the district court states, citing\n\nComm'r of Corps. & Taxation v. Springfield, 321 Mass. 31, 35\n\n(1947), that     \"[l]ikewise,   contractually    required    notices   must\n\nalways be clear and unambiguous in order to fulfill their intended\n\npurpose.\"    Seaboard Sur. Co., 266 F. Supp. 2d at 196.         Comm'r of\n\nCorps., however, states the requirement under Massachusetts law\n\nthat \"[n]otices required by law or by contract to be given by one\n\nparty to the other in order to establish rights or obligations must\n\nstate with reasonable certainty the essential facts required by law\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\for by contract.\"      Comm'r of Corps., 321 Mass. at 35.       This\n\nprinciple has been applied to suggest that the \"form [of notice] is\n\nnot important but it must convey with reasonable certainty the\n\ninformation reasonably needed to serve the statutory purpose.\"\n\nCarey v. Planning Bd. of Revere, 335 Mass. 746, 748 (1957).      In\n\nboth Carey and Comm'r of Corps., the notice in question was found\n\nto be insufficient because it failed to supply the information\n\nnecessary to serve the purpose of the statutory notice provision at\n\nissue.   Carey, 335 Mass. at 747; Comm'r of Corps., 321 Mass. at 35.\n\n           As discussed earlier, the purpose of the notice provision\n\nin Paragraph 5 of the performance bond is to provide the surety\n\nwith a fifteen-day period during which it might attempt to cure the\n\nalleged breach prior to default.       As Greenfield's letters to\n\nSeaboard did not alert Seaboard to a presumed default, nor indicate\n\nthat Seaboard was in material breach, nor refer to Paragraph 5, nor\n\nwarn that Seaboard would be deemed in default in fifteen days, no\n\nreasonable jury could find that Greenfield's letters \"convey[ed]\n\nwith reasonable certainty the information reasonably needed\" to\n\nserve the purpose of Paragraph 5's notice requirement.   Carey, 335\n\nMass. at 748.   Therefore, as Greenfield's letters to Seaboard fail\n\nto create a triable issue of fact under this threshold standard for\n\nsufficiency of notice under Massachusetts law, we need not explore\n\nthe question further. Paragraph 5 of the performance bond provided\n\nSeaboard with a fifteen-day period during which it might attempt to\n\n\n                                -19-\n\fcure the alleged breach.          No reasonable jury could find that\n\nGreenfield's letters put Seaboard on notice that this fifteen-day\n\nperiod had commenced.2\n\n                           III.    Conclusion\n\n          Greenfield     failed   to   provide   an   \"additional   written\n\nnotice\" that could reasonably be found to put Seaboard on notice\n\nthat the fifteen-day period had begun after which Seaboard would be\n\ndeemed in default under Paragraph 5.             This material breach by\n\nGreenfield discharges Seaboard from liability under the bond as a\n\n\n2\n  The negotiations and exchanges of proposed and revised takeover\nagreements that ensued and continued until the day of the Building\nCommittee's vote also belie Greenfield's claim that the letters\nserved as notice of default.        Whether or not Seaboard was\ninappropriately demanding concessions in the negotiations, as\nGreenfield alleges, the record shows that neither Seaboard nor\nGreenfield framed the proceedings in the context of impending\ndefault.   Greenfield argues that its efforts to work toward a\ncompromise after December 1st should not be held against it,\ncontending that Greenfield's efforts \"to obtain even dilatory\nperformance\" did not excuse Seaboard from its contractual duty to\nact promptly.   Bayer & Mingolla Const. Co., 205 N.E.2d at 212.\nSimilarly,   however,   Greenfield's   continued  efforts   toward\ncompromise do not excuse Greenfield from its obligation to provide\nan additional written notice of default to Seaboard as required by\nParagraph 5.\n\n     Greenfield also argues that Seaboard's complaint conceded that\nthe November 15th letter complied with Paragraph 5. The complaint\nstates that \"[o]n or about November 15, 2000, Greenfield (through\nits attorneys) called upon Seaboard to undertake completion of the\nProject, and called for a response by November 20, 2000. Seaboard\nduly responded on November 20, 2000, stating that Seaboard was\nwilling to undertake the work in question.\" No reasonable jury\ncould find that Seaboard's characterization of Greenfield's\nNovember 15th letter as \"call[ing] upon Seaboard to undertake\ncompletion\" conceded that the letter provided notice to the surety\nthat the fifteen-day period before it would be deemed in default\nunder Paragraph 5 had begun.\n\n                                   -20-\n\fmatter of law.   The district court's grant of summary judgment is\n\ntherefore affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                   \"Dissenting opinion follows\"\n\n\n\n\n                               -21-\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).       Paragraph 5 of the\n\nsurety bond provides in relevant part:\n\n           If the Surety does not proceed as provided in\n           Paragraph 4 with reasonable promptness, the\n           Surety shall be deemed to be in default on\n           this Bond fifteen days after receipt of an\n           additional written notice from the Owner to\n           the Surety demanding that the Surety perform\n           its obligations under this Bond, and the Owner\n           shall be entitled to enforce any remedy\n           available to the Owner.\n\nOn August 24, 2000, Greenfield notified Seaboard of ICC's default\n\nand termination, and agreed to pay the balance of the contract\n\nprice to Seaboard or to a replacement contractor pursuant to\n\nParagraphs 3.2 and 3.3 of the bond.       Thus, after August 24, 2000,\n\nSeaboard was required to \"proceed as provided in Paragraph 4 with\n\nreasonable promptness.\"    If it did not, Greenfield was entitled to\n\ndeliver    the   \"additional   written   notice\"   under   Paragraph   5,\n\nbeginning the 15 day period before Seaboard would be deemed in\n\ndefault.\n\n            As the majority recognizes, Massachusetts law governs the\n\nprovisions of the surety bond.           In Massachusetts, \"[n]otices\n\nrequired by law or by contract to be given by one party to the\n\nother in order to establish rights or obligations must state with\n\nreasonable certainty the essential facts required by law or by\n\ncontract, as the case may be.\"       Comm'n of Corps. & Taxation v.\n\nSpringfield, 321 Mass. 31, 35 (1947).       See also Carey v. Planning\n\nBd. of Revere, 335 Mass. 746, 748 (1957) (\"[The] form [of the\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\fnotice]   is   not   important   but   it   must   convey   with   reasonable\n\ncertainty the information reasonably needed to serve the statutory\n\npurpose.\").    In this case, the essential information required by\n\nParagraph 5 was a \"demand[] that the Surety perform its obligations\n\nunder [the] Bond.\"       Thus, our task is to determine whether a\n\nreasonable jury could find that Greenfield's communications to\n\nSeaboard constituted an \"additional written notice\" that, with\n\nreasonable certainty, \"demand[ed] that the Surety perform its\n\nobligations under [the] Bond.\"\n\n           In my view, there are several communications between\n\nGreenfield and Seaboard that a reasonable jury might find meet this\n\nrequirement.     As early as September 26, 2000, Greenfield had\n\nformally asked Seaboard to perform its obligations under the bond\n\nand had laid out a timetable for Seaboard's decision:\n\n           Lastly, [Greenfield] is formally asking the\n           surety to undertake to perform and complete\n           the construction contract itself, or through\n           its agents or independent contractors as set\n           forth in the surety contract, paragraph 4.2.\n           Please be further advised that [Greenfield]\n           believes that they will require a decision by\n           the surety no later than October 20, 2000 so\n           that work may begin in earnest to move forward\n           on the project by November 4, 2000.\n\nA November 15, 2000, letter again called on Seaboard to decide\n\nwhether it would complete the project:\n\n           [Greenfield] must now decide if it will\n           complete   the   project.    It  is   still\n           [Greenfield's] preference to have Seaboard\n           complete.   Seaboard has been aware of the\n           problems with ICC for several years and\n\n                                   -23-\n\f            Seaboard has had two and one half months since\n            ICC's termination to assess and determine its\n            position on completion. The time for Seaboard\n            to make a decision is here.\n\nThe November 15th letter concluded by asking that \"Seaboard provide\n\n[Greenfield] with an indication of its intentions by November 20,\n\n2000,\" setting yet another deadline for Seaboard's decision.\n\n            Finally, a November 22, 2000, letter set a third deadline\n\nand clearly indicated that Greenfield was prepared to pursue\n\ncompletion by another contractor if Seaboard did not perform its\n\nobligations under the bond:\n\n            Time is truly of the essence in negotiating a\n            takeover   agreement   and    commencing   the\n            completion of the work.      [Greenfield] has\n            targeted December 1, 2000 as the date by which\n            work on the completion of the contract should\n            commence. [Greenfield] is prepared to do what\n            is necessary to meet that date.        If the\n            takeover   agreement    cannot   be   reached,\n            [Greenfield] will be compelled to proceed with\n            its other completion options.\n\nEach   of   these   letters   asked    Seaboard   to   either   perform   its\n\nobligations under the bond or allow Greenfield to pursue other\n\noptions.     In my view, a reasonable jury could find that these\n\nletters constituted an \"additional written notice\" that, with\n\nreasonable certainty, \"demand[ed] that the Surety perform its\n\nobligations under the Bond.\"\n\n            The majority reasons that \"[a]s Greenfield's letters to\n\nSeaboard did not alert Seaboard to a presumed default, nor indicate\n\nthat Seaboard was in material breach, nor refer to Paragraph 5, nor\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fwarn that Seaboard would be deemed in default in fifteen days, no\n\nreasonable jury could find that Greenfield's letters 'convey[ed]\n\nwith reasonable certainty the information reasonably needed' to\n\nserve the purpose of Paragraph 5's notice requirement.\"           Paragraph\n\n5, however, does not require that Greenfield's notice contain any\n\nof these provisions.       It merely requires a \"demand[] that the\n\nSurety perform its obligations under the Bond.\" If the parties had\n\nwished to require a more comprehensive notice -- including explicit\n\nreference to Paragraph 5 and a recitation of the consequences of\n\nGreenfield's notice -- they could have altered Paragraph 5's\n\nrequirements.    They did not do so, and it is not our province to\n\nread more stringent requirements into that provision.\n\n           Moreover, Greenfield was not required by principles of\n\ncontract   law   to   educate   Seaboard   as   to   the    consequences   of\n\nGreenfield's demand that Seaboard perform its obligations under the\n\nbond. \"[U]nder Massachusetts law, 'one who signs a writing that is\n\ndesigned to serve as a legal document . . .           is presumed to know\n\nits contents.'\"       Salois v. Dime Sav. Bank, 128 F.3d 20, 26 n.10\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Hull v. Attleboro Sav. Bank, 33 Mass. App.\n\nCt. 18, 24 (1992)). Thus, we must presume that Seaboard understood\n\nParagraph 5's requirements, including that it would be deemed in\n\ndefault 15 days after receiving additional written notice demanding\n\nthat it perform its obligations under the bond.            It was Seaboard's\n\nresponsibility to protect its rights by acting within its 15 day\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fwindow of opportunity.         Greenfield's only duty was to provide the\n\nnotice required by Paragraph 5 in compliance with the Massachusetts\n\n\"reasonable certainty\" standard, regardless of whether Seaboard\n\nrecognized      that   the   notice   formally    triggered      the    terms   of\n\nParagraph 5.        See, e.g., Univ. Emergency Med. Found. v. Rapier\n\nInves., Ltd., 197 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that the\n\nparties   to    a   contract    may   specify    the   manner    of    sufficient\n\ntermination notice in the terms of the contract); Westmoreland v.\n\nGen. Acc. Fire & Life Assur. Corp., 144 Conn. 265, 270 (1957) (\"It\n\nis always competent for parties to contract as to how notice shall\n\nbe given, unless their contract is in conflict with law or public\n\npolicy.     When they do so contract, the giving of a notice by the\n\nmethod contracted for is sufficient whether it results in actual\n\nnotice or not.\") (collecting cases).\n\n            Greenfield and Seaboard have been engaged in a long and\n\nbitter dispute over their respective obligations under the surety\n\ncontract.      The financial stakes are considerable for both parties.\n\nWe should not resolve this case with a legal ruling that rewrites\n\nthe content of the notice required by Paragraph 5 of the bond.\n\nRather,   whether      Greenfield's    multiple    letters      constituted     an\n\nadequate \"demand[] that the Surety perform its obligations under\n\n[the] Bond\" is a quintessential jury question.             I would therefore\n\nvacate the entry of summary judgment and remand to the district\n\n\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fcourt so that this issue could be resolved by the appropriate fact\n\nfinder.\n\n          I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                              -27-\n\f",

After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize the lengthy narrative of the failed relationship between the parties, relating only those facts relevant to our review. On June 18, 1998, Greenfield contracted with Interstate Construction Company (\"ICC\") to renovate its Middle School building. ICC provided the performance bond required by Massachusetts law, with Seaboard as surety. The bond is a standard performance bond, Form A312, issued by the American Institute of Architects in 1984. It provides that the Contractor (ICC) and the Surety (Seaboard), jointly and severally, bind themselves to the Owner (Greenfield) for the performance of the Construction Contract, which the bond incorporates by reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 3 of the bond provides that the surety's obligation under the bond arises after:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.1 The Owner has notified the Contractor and the Surety ... that the Owner is considering declaring a Contractor Default and has requested and attempted to arrange a conference with the Contractor and the Surety to be held not later than fifteen days after receipt of such notice to discuss methods of performing the Construction Contract. If the Owner, the Contractor and the Surety agree, the Contractor shall be allowed a reasonable time to perform the Construction Contract, but such an agreement shall not waive the Owner's right, if any, subsequently to declare a Contractor Default; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.2 The Owner has declared a Contractor Default and formally terminated the Contractor's right to complete the contract. Such Contractor Default shall not be declared earlier than twenty days after the Contractor and the Surety have received notice as provided in Subparagraph 3.1; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.3 The Owner has agreed to pay the Balance of the Contract Price to the Surety in accordance with the terms of the Construction Contract or to a contractor selected to perform the Construction Contract in accordance with the terms of the contract with the Owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the owner has complied with the provisions of Paragraph 3, and the surety's obligations are triggered, Paragraph 4 provides that the surety \"shall promptly and at the Surety's expense\" take one of a list of specified \"actions.\" The action at issue in this case, as described in subparagraph 4.2, is to \"[u]ndertake to perform and complete the Construction Contract itself, through its agents or through independent contractors.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 5 provides that \"[i]f the Surety does not proceed as provided in Paragraph 4 with reasonable promptness, the Surety shall be deemed to be in default on the Bond fifteen days after receipt of an additional written notice from the Owner to the Surety demanding that the Surety perform its obligations under this Bond, and the Owner shall be entitled to enforce any remedy available to the Owner.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In compliance with subparagraph 3.1, Greenfield notified ICC and Seaboard on November 12, 1998, and again on March 23, 2000, that it was considering declaring a Contractor Default. On August 24, 2000, after continuous struggle regarding ICC's tardiness, Greenfield sent ICC a notice of default and termination and filed suit in state court. That same day, Greenfield notified Seaboard of ICC's termination and agreed to pay the balance of the contract price to Seaboard or to a replacement contractor, as required by Paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 of the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 25, 2000, Seaboard responded, asserting its need for a reasonable time to investigate, requesting documentation of ICC's default, and reminding Greenfield of the owner's duty to mitigate the surety's damages. Greenfield hired an Interim Construction Management Consultant, Baybutt Construction Corporation (\"Baybutt\"), to evaluate and to advise the town on the emergency work needed in the interim. Greenfield notified Seaboard that moisture had caused the subflooring of the new floors to buckle and the carpets to detach, and that the allocation of responsibility for this damage (between Greenfield and ICC) was already before the state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 26, 2000, Greenfield sent Seaboard further documentation regarding ICC's termination and \"formally ask[ed] the surety to undertake to perform and complete the construction itself, or through its agents or independent contractors as set forth in the surety contract, paragraph 4.2,\" with a response requested from Seaboard by October 20, 2000, so that work might begin by November 4, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 11, 2000, representatives of Greenfield, ICC, and Seaboard met. Seaboard agreed to prepare a proposal by October 18th addressing the emergency work. After some delay, Seaboard delivered a proposal to perform the emergency work &#8212; not including the floor remediation &#8212; stating that this was not an offer to perform under the bond because ICC's termination remained contested and Seaboard was still investigating its position with respect to the completion of the project and the remediation of the floors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, 2000, Greenfield and Seaboard signed an Emergency Work Agreement to mitigate both parties' damages. Seaboard agreed to perform the emergency work, beginning on November 6th and finishing by December 31st, for which Greenfield would pay $207,000. Seaboard hired a Construction Manager, Wayne Sheridan, for the emergency work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 2000, Greefield's attorney faxed three letters to Seaboard's attorney. The first conveyed the conclusion of Greenfield's interim consultant, Baybutt, that work would need to be commenced by December 1st for the building to be ready for school the next fall. Estimated costs, including moisture remediation, were $5.6 million &#8212; $3.8 million more than the remaining contract funds. The second letter informed Seaboard that the Building Committee had approached the Town Council to appropriate these funds \"if Seaboard declines to complete\" and insisted again that work needed to commence by early December. The third letter demanded that Seaboard \"soon decide if it will honor its obligations ... under the performance bond and complete the project.\" This letter reiterated the necessity that work begin by early December and asked Seaboard to commit by November 20th.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 20, 2000, Seaboard responded that, while its investigation of ICC's termination continued, Seaboard was \"willing to perform the remedial and contract work,\" and was \"prepared to take all necessary action to expeditiously arrive at a comprehensive agreement with [Greenfield] so that the remedial and contract work can be commenced as soon as possible.\" Seaboard requested further documentation regarding the floor remediation work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 21, 2000, Greenfield sent Seaboard further documentation and, on November 22nd, objected to the Town being required to pay for the entire cost of the floor remediation. While the allocation of responsibility for the floors was still in dispute, Greenfield offered to split the costs, under reservation of rights. Greenfield also expressed concern about Seaboard's management team and timely completion. Greenfield was concerned that Seaboard's project manager, Wayne Sheridan, was frequently absent from the work site. Greenfield sought the right to review and to approve any new project management team. Greenfield warned Seaboard that if construction did not begin by December 1st, Greenfield \"will be compelled to proceed with its other completion options.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Greenfield acceded, under reservation of rights, to cover the costs of the floor remediation, and on December 1st, Seaboard sent Greenfield a draft Takeover Agreement. Greenfield proposed revisions and further negotiations ensued. On December 8th, Greenfield's attorney notified Seaboard that the Building Committee would meet on December 11th to decide how to proceed. On December 11th, Seaboard faxed Greenfield a new draft of the Takeover Agreement which identified Sheridan, the Construction Manager with whom Greenfield was dissatisfied, as the proposed Project Manager. At the Building Committee meeting that night, the Committee decided to hire Baybutt to complete the project. The next day, Greenfield notified Seaboard of the decision to proceed without Seaboard's involvement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 22, 2000, Seaboard filed a complaint in the district court seeking a declaratory judgment discharging it from obligation under the performance bond on the grounds that Greenfield had materially breached the bond by hiring its own contractor. Seaboard claimed that it had elected to complete the contract, as permitted under the bond, but that Greenfield had refused to allow the takeover, and that Seaboard was thus denied the opportunity to limit its financial exposure. Greenfield filed counterclaims, alleging Seaboard's breach of the bond. After discovery, cross motions for summary judgment were filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 7, 2003, the district court granted Seaboard's motion for summary judgment. Rejecting any anticipatory repudiation defense for Greenfield as disallowed under Massachusetts law, the court held that \"[b]ecause a clear and direct default notice was not served pursuant to Paragraph 5, ... Greenfield was in material breach of the Bond when it ceased its dealings with Seaboard and hired another company.\" <i>Seaboard Sur. Co. v. Town of Greenfield,</i> 266 F.Supp.2d 189, 198 (D.Mass.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence before the court shows \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). For the purposes of summary judgment, \"`genuine' means that `the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party', and a `material fact' is one which `might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.'\" <i>Hayes v. Douglas Dynamics, Inc.,</i> 8 F.3d 88, 90 (1st Cir.1993)(quoting <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). We review <i>de novo</i> the district court's grant of summary judgment, viewing the facts and making all reasonable inferences in favor of Greenfield, the nonmoving party. <i>Rodr&#237;guez v. Smithkline Beecham,</i> 224 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2000). We may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that Greenfield complied with the notice requirements regarding ICC's default provided by Paragraph 3 of the performance bond. Seaboard argues, however, that Greenfield failed to provide notice of Seaboard's default before terminating Seaboard's involvement, as required by Paragraph 5. Greenfield contends that Seaboard had previously breached the performance bond by failing to take prompt action following ICC's default as required by Paragraph 4 and that Greenfield's communications with Seaboard complied with Paragraph 5's notice requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find it unnecessary to address Seaboard's compliance with Paragraph 4. The district court examined the evidence on the issue and denied Greenfield's motion for summary judgment because \"the Court cannot find as a matter of law that Seaboard committed a material breach of the terms and conditions of the Bond by failing to promptly select and undertake action under paragraph 4.\" <i>Seaboard Sur. Co.,</i> 266 F.Supp.2d at 195. The district court opinion ultimately rests, however, on Greenfield's failure to comply with Paragraph 5. The district court concludes that Greenfield's Paragraph 4 claims against Seaboard \"necessarily fail ... due to Greenfield's material breach of the Bond,\" and describes Greenfield's breach thus: \"Because a clear and direct default notice was not served pursuant to Paragraph 5, the Court finds that Greenfield was in material breach of the Bond when it ceased its dealings with Seaboard and hired another company to complete the Project.\" <i>Id.</i> at 198. The district court therefore concludes that \"Greenfield's refusal to allow Seaboard to complete the Project renders the Bond null and void and discharges Seaboard from any and all liability under the Bond.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. City of Green River,</i> 93 F.Supp.2d 1170 (D.Wyo.2000), <i>aff'd,</i> 6 Fed. Appx. 828 (10th Cir.2001)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's conclusion that Greenfield's compliance with Paragraph 5 is dispositive of both parties' claims. Even assuming that Seaboard failed to provide the prompt response to contractor default required by Paragraph 4, the surety default provision of Paragraph 5 constitutes an important contractual right of the surety. Paragraph 5 provides the surety fifteen days during which it may attempt to cure the alleged breach prior to default and thus to minimize its economic exposure. Failure to provide this notice constitutes a material breach of the bond. <i>School Bd. of Escambia Cty. v. TIG Premier Ins. Co.,</i> 110 F.Supp.2d 1351, 1353 (N.D.Fla.2000)(\"[F]ailure to adhere to a performance bond notification requirement is a material breach, resulting in the loss of an obligee's rights under the bond.\"); <i>St. Paul,</i> 93 F.Supp.2d at 1178 (\"Courts have consistently held that an obligee's action that deprives a surety of its ability to protect itself pursuant to performance options granted under a performance bond constitutes a material breach, which renders the bond null and void.\"); <i>cf. Dragon Constr., Inc. v. Parkway Bank &amp; Trust,</i> 287 Ill.App.3d 29, 222 Ill.Dec. 648, 678 N.E.2d 55, 58 (Ill.App.Ct.1997)(owner's \"failure to provide adequate notice of [contractor's] termination... stripped [surety] of its right to limit its liability and constituted a material breach of contract which rendered the surety bonds null and void.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenfield seeks refuge in the contention that under Massachusetts law \"compensated sureties ... ought not to be relieved from their obligations on merely technical grounds, not affecting substantially the character of the undertaking which they assumed.\" <i>Bayer &amp; Mingolla Constr. Co, Inc. v. Deschenes,</i> 348 Mass. 594, 205 N.E.2d 208, 211 n. 4 (1965)(quoting <i>Maryland Cas. Co. v. Dunlap,</i> 68 F.2d 289, 291 (1st Cir.1933)). While it is true that \"Massachusetts courts have held that lack of prompt notice to the compensated surety of a contractor's default (as required by a Performance Bond) does not discharge the surety if it is not harmed,\" notice requirements \"exist [] precisely to provide the surety an opportunity to protect itself against loss by participating in the selection of the successor contractor to ensure that the lowest bidder is hired and damages mitigated.\" <i>Enterprise Capital, Inc. v. San-Gra Corp.,</i> 284 F.Supp.2d 166, 177 (D.Mass.2003) (citations omitted). In the context of surety default, the notice provision similarly provides an opportunity for the surety to cure the breach and thus mitigate damages. As the court concluded in <i>Enterprise Capital,</i> \"even if [Seaboard] must show injury, loss, or prejudice, it meets this hurdle, given its deprivation of mitigation opportunities.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must therefore determine whether the record creates a triable issue of fact as to Greenfield's compliance with Paragraph 5 of the performance bond. Paragraph 5 provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Surety does not proceed as provided in Paragraph 4 with reasonable promptness, the Surety will be deemed to be in default on this Bond fifteen days after receipt of an additional written notice from the Owner to the Surety demanding that the Surety perform its obligations under this Bond, and the Owner shall be entitled to enforce any remedy available to the Owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenfield contends that several letters it sent to Seaboard, and particularly two letters dated November 15th, constituted \"an additional written notice ... demanding that the surety perform its obligations\" in compliance with Paragraph 5 and that Seaboard was thus properly deemed in default fifteen days thereafter and prior to Greenfield's December 11th decision to hire Baybutt to complete the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe and quote these letters at some length, as our decision rests on whether a reasonable jury could find them to constitute the \"additional written notice\" required by Paragraph 5. The first, dated September 26, 2000, responds in detail to Seaboard's requests for documentation regarding ICC's termination and concludes thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the Building Committee is formally asking the surety to undertake to perform and complete the construction contract itself, or through its agents or independent contractors as set forth in the surety contract, paragraph 4.2. Please be further advised that owner believes that they will require a decision by the surety no later than October 20, 2000 so that work may begin in earnest to move forward on the project by November 4, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two additional letters were sent to Seaboard's counsel on November 15th. The first informs Seaboard that Greenfield Middle School Building Committee (\"GMSBC\") has presented a proposal to obtain additional funding in case Seaboard declines to complete. It then discusses a report prepared by Baybutt indicating that work must commence by early December in order for the school to be ready for the 2001 school year.

It would appear that one way for Seaboard to minimize that financial exposure would be to assume performance and complete the contract.

It is still the GMSBC's preference to have Seaboard complete.

The time for Seaboard to make a decision is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The GMSBC is concerned by Seaboard's indecision regarding completion of the Project and is concerned that Seaboard may be giving too much credit to ICC's explanations and excuses as to what went wrong on the project. The GMSBC asks that Seaboard undertake an objective review of the facts that culminated in the GMSBC's decision to terminate ICC, before it decides if it will honor its performance bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter then presents a detailed explanation of Greenfield's decision to terminate ICC.

The GMSBC believes it is in the best interests of the Town and Seaboard to work together to complete the Project since a mutual effort will be required to get the school opened as quickly as possible. If there are differences in our positions that cannot immediately be resolved, the GMSBC will entertain the adoption of solutions that will allow the parties to \"agree to disagree\" over those differences, as long as construction progresses. If Seaboard assumes completion of the Project and adheres to a reasonable construction schedule, the GMSBC's consultants believe that the Project can still be completed before the September 2001 school opening. If, however, the GMSBC is compelled to develop new bid packages and receive competitive proposals to complete, the increases in project cost and the delay in completion could be even more severe than the GMSBC's current projections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Should Seaboard decide to honor its performance bond, there will be a substantial amount of work that will need to be completed in a timely manner.

The GMSBC wants Seaboard to complete the Project and is anxious to get the work underway. However, the GMSBC has concerns with Seaboard's position that the GMSBC must pay for all the costs to remedy the floor damage ... In addition to resolving the question of who between Seaboard and the GMSBC pays what portion of the floor remediation work, the GMSBC has a number of additional concerns that must be satisfactorily addressed in a takeover agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter proceeds to describe the GMSBC's position on the floor remediation costs and proposes that Seaboard and the GMSBC split the costs, reserving their rights against one another and against ICC, until the allocation of responsibility is determined in court. The letter then lists and discusses seven \"other key issues that must be satisfactorily addressed in any takeover agreement.\" It concludes thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Please contact me at your earliest opportunity, to discuss Seaboard's position regarding the above issues.

The GMSBC has targeted December 1, 2000 as the date by which work on the completion of the contract should commence. The GMBSC is prepared to do what is necessary to meet that date.

S. Concrete Serv., Inc.,</i> 17 F.3d 106, 111 (5th Cir.1994)(finding insufficient notice of default when owner's letters never mentioned the word \"default\"); <i>Elm Haven Constr. Ltd. P'ship v. Neri Constr., LLC,</i> 281 F.Supp.2d 406 (D.Conn.2003) (insufficient notice when letters only complained about performance and financial status); <i>Balfour Beatty Constr., Inc. v. Colonial Ornamental Iron Works, Inc.,</i> 986 F.Supp. 82, 86 (D.Conn.1997) (insufficient notice when letters only mention delay in performance). The district court applied this standard in the related context of surety default before us and concluded that Greenfield's letters failed to provide \"a clear and direct default notice\" to Seaboard. <i>Seaboard Sur. Co.,</i> 266 F.Supp.2d at 198.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the standard for sufficiency of notice applied by the district court comports with the general standard that \"[n]otice must be clear, definite, explicit, and unambiguous,\" 58 Am.Jur.2d Notice &#167; 2, there is no dispute that the performance bond at issue here is governed by Massachusetts law. Although neither party before us nor the decision below suggests that Massachusetts law provides a relevant standard for sufficiency of notice meaningfully distinct from that applied by the district court, we must address the issue. In introducing the \"clear, direct and unequivocal\" standard, the district court states, citing <i>Comm'r of Corps. &amp; Taxation v. Springfield,</i> 321 Mass. 31, 35, 71 N.E.2d 593 (1947), that \"[l]ikewise, contractually required notices must always be clear and unambiguous in order to fulfill their intended purpose.\" <i>Seaboard Sur. Co.,</i> 266 F.Supp.2d at 196. <i>Comm'r of Corps.,</i> however, states the requirement under Massachusetts law that \"[n]otices required by law or by contract to be given by one party to the other in order to establish rights or obligations must state with reasonable certainty the essential facts required by law or by contract.\" <i>Comm'r of Corps.,</i> 321 Mass. at 35, 71 N.E.2d 593. This principle has been applied to suggest that the \"form [of notice] is not important but it must convey with reasonable certainty the information reasonably needed to serve the statutory purpose.\" <i>Carey v. Planning Bd. of Revere,</i> 335 Mass. 746, 748, 141 N.E.2d 895 (1957). In both <i>Carey</i> and <i>Comm'r of Corps.,</i> the notice in question was found to be insufficient because it failed to supply the information necessary to serve the purpose of the statutory notice provision at issue. <i>Carey,</i> 335 Mass. at 747, 141 N.E.2d 895; <i>Comm'r of Corps.,</i> 321 Mass. at 35, 71 N.E.2d 593.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed earlier, the purpose of the notice provision in Paragraph 5 of the performance bond is to provide the surety with a fifteen-day period during which it might attempt to cure the alleged breach prior to default. As Greenfield's letters to Seaboard did not alert Seaboard to a presumed default, nor indicate that Seaboard was in material breach, nor refer to Paragraph 5, nor warn that Seaboard would be deemed in default in fifteen days, no reasonable jury could find that Greenfield's letters \"convey[ed] with reasonable certainty the information reasonably needed\" to serve the purpose of Paragraph 5's notice requirement. <i>Carey,</i> 335 Mass. at 748, 141 N.E.2d 895. Therefore, as Greenfield's letters to Seaboard fail to create a triable issue of fact under this threshold standard for sufficiency of notice under Massachusetts law, we need not explore the question further. Paragraph 5 of the performance bond provided Seaboard with a fifteen-day period during which it might attempt to cure the alleged breach. No reasonable jury could find that Greenfield's letters put Seaboard on notice that this fifteen-day period had commenced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenfield failed to provide an \"additional written notice\" that could reasonably be found to put Seaboard on notice that the fifteen-day period had begun after which Seaboard would be deemed in default under Paragraph 5. This material breach by Greenfield discharges Seaboard from liability under the bond as a matter of law. The district court's grant of summary judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Greenfield argues in the alternative that Paragraph 5 does not make notice a condition precedent of surety default but instead simply provides an optional vehicle through which the owner may protect itself from any future claims of the surety. We find this reading of Paragraph 5 contrary to the unambiguous language of the bond, and, under Massachusetts law, \"when the wording of a contract is unambiguous, the terms will be enforced.\"<i>Paterson-Leitch Co., Inc. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co.,</i> 840 F.2d 985, 991 (1st Cir.1988)(citing <i>Edmonds v. United States,</i> 642 F.2d 877, 881 (1st Cir.1981)).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The negotiations and exchanges of proposed and revised takeover agreements that ensued and continued until the day of the Building Committee's vote also belie Greenfield's claim that the letters served as notice of default. Whether or not Seaboard was inappropriately demanding concessions in the negotiations, as Greenfield alleges, the record shows that neither Seaboard nor Greenfield framed the proceedings in the context of impending default. Greenfield argues that its efforts to work toward a compromise after December 1st should not be held against it, contending that Greenfield's efforts \"to obtain even dilatory performance\" did not excuse Seaboard from its contractual duty to act promptly<i>Bayer &amp; Mingolla Const. Co.,</i> 205 N.E.2d at 212. Similarly, however, Greenfield's continued efforts toward compromise do not excuse Greenfield from its obligation to provide an additional written notice of default to Seaboard as required by Paragraph 5.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Greenfield also argues that Seaboard's complaint conceded that the November 15th letter complied with Paragraph 5. The complaint states that \"[o]n or about November 15, 2000, Greenfield (through its attorneys) called upon Seaboard to undertake completion of the Project, and called for a response by November 20, 2000. Seaboard duly responded on November 20, 2000, stating that Seaboard was willing to undertake the work in question.\" No reasonable jury could find that Seaboard's characterization of Greenfield's November 15th letter as \"call[ing] upon Seaboard to undertake completion\" conceded that the letter provided notice to the surety that the fifteen-day period before it would be deemed in default under Paragraph 5 had begun.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LIPEZ, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 5 of the surety bond provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Surety does not proceed as provided in Paragraph 4 with reasonable promptness, the Surety shall be deemed to be in default on this Bond fifteen days after receipt of an additional written notice from the Owner to the Surety demanding that the Surety perform its obligations under this Bond, and the Owner shall be entitled to enforce any remedy available to the Owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 24, 2000, Greenfield notified Seaboard of ICC's default and termination, and agreed to pay the balance of the contract price to Seaboard or to a replacement contractor pursuant to Paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 of the bond. Thus, after August 24, 2000, Seaboard was required to \"proceed as provided in Paragraph 4 with reasonable promptness.\" If it did not, Greenfield was entitled to deliver the \"additional written notice\" under Paragraph 5, beginning the 15 day period before Seaboard would be deemed in default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the majority recognizes, Massachusetts law governs the provisions of the surety bond. In Massachusetts, \"[n]otices required by law or by contract to be given by one party to the other in order to establish rights or obligations must state with reasonable certainty the essential facts required by law or by contract, as the case may be.\" <i>Comm'n of Corps. &amp; Taxation v. Springfield,</i> 321 Mass. 31, 35, 71 N.E.2d 593 (1947). <i>See also Carey v. Planning Bd. of Revere,</i> 335 Mass. 746, 748, 141 N.E.2d 895 (1957) (\"[The] form [of the notice] is not important but it must convey with reasonable certainty the information reasonably needed to serve the statutory purpose.\"). In this case, the essential information required by Paragraph 5 was a \"demand[] that the Surety perform its obligations under [the] Bond.\" Thus, our task is to determine whether a reasonable jury could find that Greenfield's communications to Seaboard constituted an \"additional written notice\" that, with reasonable certainty, \"demand[ed] that the Surety perform its obligations under [the] Bond.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, there are several communications between Greenfield and Seaboard that a reasonable jury might find meet this requirement. As early as September 26, 2000, Greenfield had formally asked Seaboard to perform its obligations under the bond and had laid out a timetable for Seaboard's decision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, [Greenfield] is formally asking the surety to undertake to perform and complete the construction contract itself, or through its agents or independent contractors as set forth in the surety contract, paragraph 4.2. Please be further advised that [Greenfield] believes that they will require a decision by the surety no later than October 20, 2000 so that work may begin in earnest to move forward on the project by November 4, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A November 15, 2000, letter again called on Seaboard to decide whether it would complete the project:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Greenfield] must now decide if it will complete the project. It is still [Greenfield's] preference to have Seaboard complete. Seaboard has been aware of the problems with ICC for several years and Seaboard has had two and one half months since ICC's termination to assess and determine its position on completion. The time for Seaboard to make a decision is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The November 15th letter concluded by asking that \"Seaboard provide [Greenfield] with an indication of its intentions by November 20, 2000,\" setting yet another deadline for Seaboard's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, a November 22, 2000, letter set a third deadline and clearly indicated that Greenfield was prepared to pursue completion by another contractor if Seaboard did not perform its obligations under the bond:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Time is truly of the essence in negotiating a takeover agreement and commencing the completion of the work.

In my view, a reasonable jury could find that these letters constituted an \"additional written notice\" that, with reasonable certainty, \"demand[ed] that the Surety perform its obligations under the Bond.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority reasons that \"[a]s Greenfield's letters to Seaboard did not alert Seaboard to a presumed default, nor indicate that Seaboard was in material breach, nor refer to Paragraph 5, nor warn that Seaboard would be deemed in default in fifteen days, no reasonable jury could find that Greenfield's letters `convey[ed] with reasonable certainty the information reasonably needed' to serve the purpose of Paragraph 5's notice requirement.\" Paragraph 5, however, does not require that Greenfield's notice contain any of these provisions. It merely requires a \"demand[] that the Surety perform its obligations under the Bond.\" If the parties had wished to require a more comprehensive notice &#8212; including explicit reference to Paragraph 5 and a recitation of the consequences of Greenfield's notice &#8212; they could have altered Paragraph 5's requirements. They did not do so, and it is not our province to read more stringent requirements into that provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Greenfield was not required by principles of contract law to educate Seaboard as to the consequences of Greenfield's demand that Seaboard perform its obligations under the bond. \"[U]nder Massachusetts law, `one who signs a writing that is designed to serve as a legal document ... is presumed to know its contents.'\" <i>Salois v. Dime Sav. Bank,</i> 128 F.3d 20, 26 n. 10 (1st Cir.1997) (quoting <i>Hull v. Attleboro Sav. Bank,</i> 33 Mass.App.Ct. 18, 24, 596 N.E.2d 358 (1992)). Thus, we must presume that Seaboard understood Paragraph 5's requirements, including that it would be deemed in default 15 days after receiving additional written notice demanding that it perform its obligations under the bond. It was Seaboard's responsibility to protect its rights by acting within its 15 day window of opportunity. Greenfield's only duty was to provide the notice required by Paragraph 5 in compliance with the Massachusetts \"reasonable certainty\" standard, regardless of whether Seaboard recognized that the notice formally triggered the terms of Paragraph 5. <i>See, e.g., Univ. Emergency Med. Found. v. Rapier Inves., Ltd.,</i> 197 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir.1999) (holding that the parties to a contract may specify the manner of sufficient termination notice in the terms of the contract); <i>Westmoreland v. Gen. Acc. Fire &amp; Life Assur. Corp.,</i> 144 Conn. 265, 270, 129 A.2d 623 (1957) (\"It is always competent for parties to contract as to how notice shall be given, unless their contract is in conflict with law or public policy. When they do so contract, the giving of a notice by the method contracted for is sufficient whether it results in actual notice or not.\") (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenfield and Seaboard have been engaged in a long and bitter dispute over their respective obligations under the surety contract. The financial stakes are considerable for both parties. We should not resolve this case with a legal ruling that rewrites the content of the notice required by Paragraph 5 of the bond. Rather, whether Greenfield's multiple letters constituted an adequate \"demand[] that the Surety perform its obligations under [the] Bond\" is a quintessential jury question. I would therefore vacate the entry of summary judgment and remand to the district court so that this issue could be resolved by the appropriate fact finder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

ICC provided the performance bond required by Massachusetts law, with Seaboard as surety. The bond is a standard performance bond, Form A312, issued by the American Institute of Architects in 1984.

On August 24, 2000, after continuous struggle regarding ICC's tardiness, Greenfield sent ICC a notice of default and termination and filed suit in state court. That same day, Greenfield notified Seaboard of ICC's termination and agreed to pay the balance of the contract price to Seaboard or to a replacement contractor, as required by Paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 of the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 25, 2000, Seaboard responded, asserting its need for a reasonable time to investigate, requesting documentation of ICC's default, and reminding Greenfield of the owner's duty to mitigate the surety's damages. Greenfield hired an Interim Construction Management Consultant, Baybutt Construction Corporation (\"Baybutt\"), to evaluate and to advise the town on the emergency work needed in the interim. Greenfield notified Seaboard that moisture had caused the subflooring of the new floors to buckle and the carpets to detach, and that the allocation of responsibility for this damage (between Greenfield and ICC) was already before the state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 26, 2000, Greenfield sent Seaboard further documentation regarding ICC's termination and \"formally ask[ed] the surety to undertake to perform and complete the construction itself, or through its agents or independent contractors as set forth in the surety contract, paragraph 4.2,\" with a response requested from Seaboard by October 20, 2000, so that work might begin by November 4, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 11, 2000, representatives of Greenfield, ICC, and Seaboard met. Seaboard agreed to prepare a proposal by October 18th addressing the emergency work. After some delay, Seaboard delivered a proposal to perform the emergency work &#8212; not including the floor remediation &#8212; stating that this was not an offer to perform under the bond because ICC's termination remained contested and Seaboard was still investigating its position with respect to the completion of the project and the remediation of the floors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, 2000, Greenfield and Seaboard signed an Emergency Work Agreement to mitigate both parties' damages. Seaboard agreed to perform the emergency work, beginning on November 6th and finishing by December 31st, for which Greenfield would pay $207,000. Seaboard hired a Construction Manager, Wayne Sheridan, for the emergency work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 2000, Greefield's attorney faxed three letters to Seaboard's attorney. The first conveyed the conclusion of Greenfield's interim consultant, Baybutt, that work would need to be commenced by December 1st for the building to be ready for school the next fall. Estimated costs, including moisture remediation, were $5.6 million &#8212; $3.8 million more than the remaining contract funds. The second letter informed Seaboard that the Building Committee had approached the Town Council to appropriate these funds \"if Seaboard declines to complete\" and insisted again that work needed to commence by early December. The third letter demanded that Seaboard \"soon decide if it will honor its obligations ... under the performance bond and complete the project.\" This letter reiterated the necessity that work begin by early December and asked Seaboard to commit by November 20th.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 20, 2000, Seaboard responded that, while its investigation of ICC's termination continued, Seaboard was \"willing to perform the remedial and contract work,\" and was \"prepared to take all necessary action to expeditiously arrive at a comprehensive agreement with [Greenfield] so that the remedial and contract work can be commenced as soon as possible.\" Seaboard requested further documentation regarding the floor remediation work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 21, 2000, Greenfield sent Seaboard further documentation and, on November 22nd, objected to the Town being required to pay for the entire cost of the floor remediation. While the allocation of responsibility for the floors was still in dispute, Greenfield offered to split the costs, under reservation of rights. Greenfield also expressed concern about Seaboard's management team and timely completion. Greenfield was concerned that Seaboard's project manager, Wayne Sheridan, was frequently absent from the work site. Greenfield sought the right to review and to approve any new project management team. Greenfield warned Seaboard that if construction did not begin by December 1st, Greenfield \"will be compelled to proceed with its other completion options.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Greenfield acceded, under reservation of rights, to cover the costs of the floor remediation, and on December 1st, Seaboard sent Greenfield a draft Takeover Agreement. Greenfield proposed revisions and further negotiations ensued. On December 8th, Greenfield's attorney notified Seaboard that the Building Committee would meet on December 11th to decide how to proceed. On December 11th, Seaboard faxed Greenfield a new draft of the Takeover Agreement which identified Sheridan, the Construction Manager with whom Greenfield was dissatisfied, as the proposed Project Manager. At the Building Committee meeting that night, the Committee decided to hire Baybutt to complete the project. The next day, Greenfield notified Seaboard of the decision to proceed without Seaboard's involvement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 22, 2000, Seaboard filed a complaint in the district court seeking a declaratory judgment discharging it from obligation under the performance bond on the grounds that Greenfield had materially breached the bond by hiring its own contractor. Seaboard claimed that it had elected to complete the contract, as permitted under the bond, but that Greenfield had refused to allow the takeover, and that Seaboard was thus denied the opportunity to limit its financial exposure. Greenfield filed counterclaims, alleging Seaboard's breach of the bond. After discovery, cross motions for summary judgment were filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 7, 2003, the district court granted Seaboard's motion for summary judgment. Rejecting any anticipatory repudiation defense for Greenfield as disallowed under Massachusetts law, the court held that \"[b]ecause a clear and direct default notice was not served pursuant to Paragraph 5, ... Greenfield was in material breach of the Bond when it ceased its dealings with Seaboard and hired another company.\" <i>Seaboard Sur. Co. v.

Seaboard argues, however, that Greenfield failed to provide notice of Seaboard's default before terminating Seaboard's involvement, as required by Paragraph 5. Greenfield contends that Seaboard had previously breached the performance bond by failing to take prompt action following ICC's default as required by Paragraph 4 and that Greenfield's communications with Seaboard complied with Paragraph 5's notice requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find it unnecessary to address Seaboard's compliance with Paragraph 4. The district court examined the evidence on the issue and denied Greenfield's motion for summary judgment because \"the Court cannot find as a matter of law that Seaboard committed a material breach of the terms and conditions of the Bond by failing to promptly select and undertake action under paragraph 4.\" <i>Seaboard Sur. Co.,</i> 266 F.Supp.2d at 195. The district court opinion ultimately rests, however, on Greenfield's failure to comply with Paragraph 5. The district court concludes that Greenfield's Paragraph 4 claims against Seaboard \"necessarily fail ... due to Greenfield's material breach of the Bond,\" and describes Greenfield's breach thus: \"Because a clear and direct default notice was not served pursuant to Paragraph 5, the Court finds that Greenfield was in material breach of the Bond when it ceased its dealings with Seaboard and hired another company to complete the Project.\" <i>Id.</i> at 198. The district court therefore concludes that \"Greenfield's refusal to allow Seaboard to complete the Project renders the Bond null and void and discharges Seaboard from any and all liability under the Bond.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

Even assuming that Seaboard failed to provide the prompt response to contractor default required by Paragraph 4, the surety default provision of Paragraph 5 constitutes an important contractual right of the surety. Paragraph 5 provides the surety fifteen days during which it may attempt to cure the alleged breach prior to default and thus to minimize its economic exposure. Failure to provide this notice constitutes a material breach of the bond. <i>School Bd. of Escambia Cty. v. TIG Premier Ins.

While it is true that \"Massachusetts courts have held that lack of prompt notice to the compensated surety of a contractor's default (as required by a Performance Bond) does not discharge the surety if it is not harmed,\" notice requirements \"exist [] precisely to provide the surety an opportunity to protect itself against loss by participating in the selection of the successor contractor to ensure that the lowest bidder is hired and damages mitigated.\" <i>Enterprise Capital, Inc. v.

In the context of surety default, the notice provision similarly provides an opportunity for the surety to cure the breach and thus mitigate damages.

Paragraph 5 provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Surety does not proceed as provided in Paragraph 4 with reasonable promptness, the Surety will be deemed to be in default on this Bond fifteen days after receipt of an additional written notice from the Owner to the Surety demanding that the Surety perform its obligations under this Bond, and the Owner shall be entitled to enforce any remedy available to the Owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenfield contends that several letters it sent to Seaboard, and particularly two letters dated November 15th, constituted \"an additional written notice ... demanding that the surety perform its obligations\" in compliance with Paragraph 5 and that Seaboard was thus properly deemed in default fifteen days thereafter and prior to Greenfield's December 11th decision to hire Baybutt to complete the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe and quote these letters at some length, as our decision rests on whether a reasonable jury could find them to constitute the \"additional written notice\" required by Paragraph 5. The first, dated September 26, 2000, responds in detail to Seaboard's requests for documentation regarding ICC's termination and concludes thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the Building Committee is formally asking the surety to undertake to perform and complete the construction contract itself, or through its agents or independent contractors as set forth in the surety contract, paragraph 4.2. Please be further advised that owner believes that they will require a decision by the surety no later than October 20, 2000 so that work may begin in earnest to move forward on the project by November 4, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two additional letters were sent to Seaboard's counsel on November 15th. The first informs Seaboard that Greenfield Middle School Building Committee (\"GMSBC\") has presented a proposal to obtain additional funding in case Seaboard declines to complete. It then discusses a report prepared by Baybutt indicating that work must commence by early December in order for the school to be ready for the 2001 school year. The pertinent paragraphs read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The GMSBC believes Seaboard has substantial financial exposure to the Town. It would appear that one way for Seaboard to minimize that financial exposure would be to assume performance and complete the contract. The alternative to completion by Seaboard is completion by the GMSBC through a totally different construction team, possibly after receipt of competitive bids. If the GMSBC must obtain competitive proposals, the completion costs could rise even higher than Baybutt's estimate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Greenfield Town Council is scheduled to vote on the GMSCB's $4.35 million request for additional funding on November 21, 2000. The GMSBC has asked that Seaboard provide me with a statement of Seaboard's intentions by Monday, November 20, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second letter of November 15th begins thus: \"Seaboard Surety Co. must soon decide if it will honor its obligations to the Greenfield Middle School Building Committee ... under the performance bond and complete the project.\" It explains the GMSBC's insistence that Seaboard respond promptly:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The GMSBC must now decide how it will complete the project. It is still the GMSBC's preference to have Seaboard complete. Seaboard has been aware of the problems with ICC for several years and Seaboard has had two and one half months since ICC's termination to assess and determine its position on completion. The time for Seaboard to make a decision is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The GMSBC is concerned by Seaboard's indecision regarding completion of the Project and is concerned that Seaboard may be giving too much credit to ICC's explanations and excuses as to what went wrong on the project. The GMSBC asks that Seaboard undertake an objective review of the facts that culminated in the GMSBC's decision to terminate ICC, before it decides if it will honor its performance bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter then presents a detailed explanation of Greenfield's decision to terminate ICC. It concludes thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical issue, at this time, is to determine how the project will be completed. The GMSBC believes it is in the best interests of the Town and Seaboard to work together to complete the Project since a mutual effort will be required to get the school opened as quickly as possible. If there are differences in our positions that cannot immediately be resolved, the GMSBC will entertain the adoption of solutions that will allow the parties to \"agree to disagree\" over those differences, as long as construction progresses. If Seaboard assumes completion of the Project and adheres to a reasonable construction schedule, the GMSBC's consultants believe that the Project can still be completed before the September 2001 school opening. If, however, the GMSBC is compelled to develop new bid packages and receive competitive proposals to complete, the increases in project cost and the delay in completion could be even more severe than the GMSBC's current projections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Should Seaboard decide to honor its performance bond, there will be a substantial amount of work that will need to be completed in a timely manner. Seaboard will need an experienced project management team on site to carefully direct the work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Please ask Seaboard to give this matter its immediate and careful consideration. The GMSBC has asked that Seaboard provide it with an indication of its intentions by November 20, 2000, since an important vote in the Town government on financing the completion of the work, has been scheduled for November 21, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final letter is dated November 22, 2000, and begins thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The [GMSBC] is somewhat encouraged by your November 20, 2000 correspondence indicating [Seaboard's] position on completing the Project. The GMSBC wants Seaboard to complete the Project and is anxious to get the work underway.

Although neither party before us nor the decision below suggests that Massachusetts law provides a relevant standard for sufficiency of notice meaningfully distinct from that applied by the district court, we must address the issue. In introducing the \"clear, direct and unequivocal\" standard, the district court states, citing <i>Comm'r of Corps. &amp; Taxation v.

As Greenfield's letters to Seaboard did not alert Seaboard to a presumed default, nor indicate that Seaboard was in material breach, nor refer to Paragraph 5, nor warn that Seaboard would be deemed in default in fifteen days, no reasonable jury could find that Greenfield's letters \"convey[ed] with reasonable certainty the information reasonably needed\" to serve the purpose of Paragraph 5's notice requirement. <i>Carey,</i> 335 Mass. at 748, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2120107\"><a href=\"/opinion/2120107/carey-v-planning-board-of-revere/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></a></span>. Therefore, as Greenfield's letters to Seaboard fail to create a triable issue of fact under this threshold standard for sufficiency of notice under Massachusetts law, we need not explore the question further. Paragraph 5 of the performance bond provided Seaboard with a fifteen-day period during which it might attempt to cure the alleged breach. No reasonable jury could find that Greenfield's letters put Seaboard on notice that this fifteen-day period had commenced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenfield failed to provide an \"additional written notice\" that could reasonably be found to put Seaboard on notice that the fifteen-day period had begun after which Seaboard would be deemed in default under Paragraph 5. This material breach by Greenfield discharges Seaboard from liability under the bond as a matter of law. The district court's grant of summary judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Greenfield argues in the alternative that Paragraph 5 does not make notice a condition precedent of surety default but instead simply provides an optional vehicle through which the owner may protect itself from any future claims of the surety. We find this reading of Paragraph 5 contrary to the unambiguous language of the bond, and, under Massachusetts law, \"when the wording of a contract is unambiguous, the terms will be enforced.\"<i>Paterson-Leitch Co., Inc. v.

Whether or not Seaboard was inappropriately demanding concessions in the negotiations, as Greenfield alleges, the record shows that neither Seaboard nor Greenfield framed the proceedings in the context of impending default. Greenfield argues that its efforts to work toward a compromise after December 1st should not be held against it, contending that Greenfield's efforts \"to obtain even dilatory performance\" did not excuse Seaboard from its contractual duty to act promptly<i>Bayer &amp; Mingolla Const. Co.,</i> 205 N.E.2d at 212. Similarly, however, Greenfield's continued efforts toward compromise do not excuse Greenfield from its obligation to provide an additional written notice of default to Seaboard as required by Paragraph 5.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Greenfield also argues that Seaboard's complaint conceded that the November 15th letter complied with Paragraph 5. The complaint states that \"[o]n or about November 15, 2000, Greenfield (through its attorneys) called upon Seaboard to undertake completion of the Project, and called for a response by November 20, 2000. Seaboard duly responded on November 20, 2000, stating that Seaboard was willing to undertake the work in question.\" No reasonable jury could find that Seaboard's characterization of Greenfield's November 15th letter as \"call[ing] upon Seaboard to undertake completion\" conceded that the letter provided notice to the surety that the fifteen-day period before it would be deemed in default under Paragraph 5 had begun.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LIPEZ, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 5 of the surety bond provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Surety does not proceed as provided in Paragraph 4 with reasonable promptness, the Surety shall be deemed to be in default on this Bond fifteen days after receipt of an additional written notice from the Owner to the Surety demanding that the Surety perform its obligations under this Bond, and the Owner shall be entitled to enforce any remedy available to the Owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 24, 2000, Greenfield notified Seaboard of ICC's default and termination, and agreed to pay the balance of the contract price to Seaboard or to a replacement contractor pursuant to Paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 of the bond. Thus, after August 24, 2000, Seaboard was required to \"proceed as provided in Paragraph 4 with reasonable promptness.\" If it did not, Greenfield was entitled to deliver the \"additional written notice\" under Paragraph 5, beginning the 15 day period before Seaboard would be deemed in default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the majority recognizes, Massachusetts law governs the provisions of the surety bond.

In this case, the essential information required by Paragraph 5 was a \"demand[] that the Surety perform its obligations under [the] Bond.\" Thus, our task is to determine whether a reasonable jury could find that Greenfield's communications to Seaboard constituted an \"additional written notice\" that, with reasonable certainty, \"demand[ed] that the Surety perform its obligations under [the] Bond.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, there are several communications between Greenfield and Seaboard that a reasonable jury might find meet this requirement.

Please be further advised that [Greenfield] believes that they will require a decision by the surety no later than October 20, 2000 so that work may begin in earnest to move forward on the project by November 4, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A November 15, 2000, letter again called on Seaboard to decide whether it would complete the project:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Greenfield] must now decide if it will complete the project. It is still [Greenfield's] preference to have Seaboard complete. Seaboard has been aware of the problems with ICC for several years and Seaboard has had two and one half months since ICC's termination to assess and determine its position on completion. The time for Seaboard to make a decision is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The November 15th letter concluded by asking that \"Seaboard provide [Greenfield] with an indication of its intentions by November 20, 2000,\" setting yet another deadline for Seaboard's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, a November 22, 2000, letter set a third deadline and clearly indicated that Greenfield was prepared to pursue completion by another contractor if Seaboard did not perform its obligations under the bond:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Time is truly of the essence in negotiating a takeover agreement and commencing the completion of the work. [Greenfield] has targeted December 1, 2000 as the date by which work on the completion of the contract should commence. [Greenfield] is prepared to do what is necessary to meet that date.

In my view, a reasonable jury could find that these letters constituted an \"additional written notice\" that, with reasonable certainty, \"demand[ed] that the Surety perform its obligations under the Bond.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority reasons that \"[a]s Greenfield's letters to Seaboard did not alert Seaboard to a presumed default, nor indicate that Seaboard was in material breach, nor refer to Paragraph 5, nor warn that Seaboard would be deemed in default in fifteen days, no reasonable jury could find that Greenfield's letters `convey[ed] with reasonable certainty the information reasonably needed' to serve the purpose of Paragraph 5's notice requirement.\" Paragraph 5, however, does not require that Greenfield's notice contain any of these provisions. It merely requires a \"demand[] that the Surety perform its obligations under the Bond.\" If the parties had wished to require a more comprehensive notice &#8212; including explicit reference to Paragraph 5 and a recitation of the consequences of Greenfield's notice &#8212; they could have altered Paragraph 5's requirements. They did not do so, and it is not our province to read more stringent requirements into that provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Greenfield was not required by principles of contract law to educate Seaboard as to the consequences of Greenfield's demand that Seaboard perform its obligations under the bond. \"[U]nder Massachusetts law, `one who signs a writing that is designed to serve as a legal document ... is presumed to know its contents.'\" <i>Salois v. Dime Sav.

Thus, we must presume that Seaboard understood Paragraph 5's requirements, including that it would be deemed in default 15 days after receiving additional written notice demanding that it perform its obligations under the bond. It was Seaboard's responsibility to protect its rights by acting within its 15 day window of opportunity. Greenfield's only duty was to provide the notice required by Paragraph 5 in compliance with the Massachusetts \"reasonable certainty\" standard, regardless of whether Seaboard recognized that the notice formally triggered the terms of Paragraph 5. <i>See, e.g., Univ. Emergency Med. Found. v.

Rather, whether Greenfield's multiple letters constituted an adequate \"demand[] that the Surety perform its obligations under [the] Bond\" is a quintessential jury question.
