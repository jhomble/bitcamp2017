Plaintiff-appellee,  Newell\n                                  \n\nPuerto  Rico,  Ltd. (\"Newell\"),  brought  an  action for  damages\n\nagainst  Rubbermaid  Incorporated  (\"Rubbermaid\"), alleging  that\n\nRubbermaid,  without  just  cause,  terminated  and impaired  the\n\nexclusive  distribution  agreement  between  the  two  parties in\n\nviolation of the Puerto Rico Dealers' Act, commonly known as \"Law\n\n75.\"  P.R. Laws  Ann. tit. X,    278 et seq.  (1989 Supp.).   The\n                                            \n\naction was tried  before a jury.  The jury  found that Rubbermaid\n\nterminated  the distribution  agreement  without  just cause  and\n\nawarded Newell $1,400,000  in damages.   Rubbermaid then filed  a\n\nmotion for a new  trial.  The district court  denied Rubbermaid's\n\nmotion and  entered judgment against Rubbermaid.   Rubbermaid now\n\nappeals  the  court's  denial of  its  motion  for  a new  trial.\n\nSpecifically,  Rubbermaid argues  that  (1)  the  district  court\n\nabused its  discretion in admitting  certain testimony by  one of\n\nNewell's  expert  witnesses, and  (2) the  jury's finding  on the\n\nissue of just cause was against the clear weight of the evidence.\n\n          Newell  also filed  a motion  requesting pre  and post-\n\njudgment  interest  and  attorneys'  fees.    The  court  granted\n\nNewell's motion for post-judgment  interest but denied its motion\n\nfor pre-judgment  interest and  attorneys' fees.   Newell appeals\n\nthe court's denial of pre-judgment interest and attorneys' fees. \n\n                            BACKGROUND\n\n          We review the evidence and draw inferences therefrom in\n\n                               -3-\n\nthe  light most  favorable to  the verdict  winner in  this case,\n\nNewell.   International  Adhesive Coating  Co. v.  Bolton Emerson\n                                                                 \n\nInt'l, Inc., 851 F.2d 540, 542 (1st Cir. 1988).\n           \n\n          A.  The Distribution Agreement\n\n          On May  31, 1968, Rubbermaid entered  into an agreement\n\nwith  Anchor  Hocking  Interamericana,  Ltd.  for  the  exclusive\n\ndistribution of  the Rubbermaid Houseware Product  Line in Puerto\n\nRico  and   the  United  States  Virgin   Islands  (\"Distribution\n\nAgreement\").   On March 28, 1972,  Anchor Hocking Interamericana,\n\nLtd.  assigned and  transferred  its rights  in the  Distribution\n\nAgreement to  Anchor Hocking Puerto Rico,  Ltd. (\"Anchor P.R.\").1\n\nFrom July  2,  1972 to  July  1, 1987,  Anchor  P.R., became  the\n\nexclusive  distributor of Rubbermaid Houseware Products in Puerto\n\nRico  and the Virgin  Islands.  On  July 2,  1987, Newell Company\n\nacquired  Anchor   Hocking  Corporation  and   its  subsidiaries,\n\nincluding Anchor  P.R. and thereafter continued  the distribution\n\nof Rubbermaid products in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\n          On October 31, 1991, Rubbermaid notified Newell that it\n\nwas terminating  the Distribution Agreement,  effective in ninety\n\ndays, because  Anchor P.R.  had been  unable to  achieve assigned\n\nsales objectives  and because Newell manufactured and distributed\n\nsimilar  products which  created a  conflict of  interest  in its\n\ndistribution of Rubbermaid products.   Rubbermaid then terminated\n\n                    \n\n1  Anchor Hocking Puerto Rico, Ltd. was a wholly owned subsidiary\nof Anchor Hocking Corporation  which was incorporated in Delaware\non  March  27, 1972,  for the  purpose  of acquiring  and selling\nproducts in Puerto Rico.\n\n                               -4-\n\nthe Distribution  Agreement.   The effective date  of termination\n\nwas February 3,  1992.   Anchor P.R. changed  its name to  Newell\n\nPuerto  Rico, Ltd.  In February 1992, Newell brought suit against\n\nRubbermaid,  claiming  that   Rubbermaid's  termination  of   the\n\nDistribution Agreement was unjustified.\n\n          B.  Expert Witness Testimony\n\n          During the course of  discovery, in June 1992, Newell's\n\nexpert witness on damages, Mr. Jos  Villamil, submitted a written\n\nreport estimating Newell's damages  under Law 75.  In  July 1992,\n\nRubbermaid's expert,  Dr. El as R. Guti rrez,  submitted a report\n\nchallenging the  accuracy of the valuation  estimate presented by\n\nMr. Villamil, and  questioning whether the  estimate was prepared\n\naccording to acceptable professional standards.  Doctor Guti rrez\n\nconcluded  that major flaws were  present in the  methods used by\n\nMr. Villamil to  estimate damages, and these flaws had the effect\n\nof producing an upward bias in the estimated value of damages for\n\nthe Rubbermaid line of products.2\n\n          During  his  first  deposition  on  August   11,  1992,\n\nMr. Villamil  acknowledged that  he  inadvertently  included  the\n\nvalue of the Rubbermaid Commercial Products Line, which is not at\n\nissue in this case,  in his valuation of damages.3   Accordingly,\n\nMr. Villamil agreed to  adjust his estimate and submit an amended\n\n                    \n\n2    Doctor Guti rrez  estimated  damages,  including a  goodwill\ncomponent, to be between $247,686 and $269,431.\n\n3   The  Distribution  Agreement which  is  the subject  of  this\nlawsuit  concerns the  Rubbermaid Houseware  Products Line.   The\nRubbermaid Commercial  Products Line  is a separate  and distinct\nline of products not relevant to this case.\n\n                               -5-\n\nreport reflecting his new  evaluation.  On August 13,  1992, four\n\ndays prior to  trial, Mr. Villamil submitted  an amended report.4\n\nAccording  to  Rubbermaid,  this  amended   report  included  new\n\ncalculations   using  a   methodology  and   valuation  procedure\n\ndifferent from that used  in Mr. Villamil's previous report.   On\n\nAugust  13, the court ordered  that both experts  be deposed anew\n\nand that transcripts of  the depositions be filed not  later than\n\nAugust  27, 1992.   The  Court further  determined that  it would\n\nappoint  an economist to render  a neutral expert  report.  Trial\n\nwas rescheduled for December 21, 1992.\n\n          Mr.  Villamil was  deposed  again on  August 20,  1992.\n\nDuring  this deposition,  Mr.  Villamil again  acknowledged  that\n\ncorrections  should be made to  his calculations.   On August 27,\n\n1992, Rubbermaid filed a \"Motion to Disqualify Plaintiff's Expert\n\nWitness, Exclude  Plaintiff's Expert Witness Reports  and Request\n\nfor Sanctions.\"  The court denied this motion.\n\n          On December 8, 1992,  the court appointed expert, Ernst\n\n&amp;  Young,  rendered  a report  which  included  a  review of  the\n\ndifferent reports  filed by the expert witnesses  for the parties\n\nand an independent calculation of a value or a range of values of\n\ndamages  for the distribution agreement under Law 75.  On January\n\n19,  1993, due to additional  information provided by counsel for\n\nNewell, Ernst &amp;  Young supplemented  the December 8  report.   On\n\n                    \n\n4  In  his amended  report, Mr. Villamil  estimated damages,  not\nincluding goodwill, to be between $1,620,000  and $2,941,000.  He\nestimated goodwill  at $1,013,749 and therefore,  the total value\nof the distribution of the Rubbermaid product line in Puerto Rico\nat between $2,633,749 and $3,954,749.\n\n                               -6-\n\nFebruary 2, 1993, Ernst &amp; Young submitted a final report.5\n\n          During trial,  the court  heard testimony from  Ernst &amp;\n\nYoung  regarding its report.   Mr. Villamil then  testified as an\n\nexpert for Newell.   At trial, Rubbermaid expressly conceded that\n\nMr.  Villamil was qualified as an expert.  Mr. Villamil testified\n\nthat he believed his role was to evaluate Ernst &amp; Young's report.\n\nRubbermaid objected to Mr. Villamil's testimony on the grounds of\n\nsurprise, arguing  that his  expressed views were  different from\n\nand  inconsistent with the opinions rendered in his reports.  The\n\ncourt  overruled  the objection  and  permitted  Mr. Villamil  to\n\ntestify.\n\n                  ADMISSION OF EXPERT TESTIMONY\n\n          Rubbermaid  challenges  the   admission  at  trial   of\n\nMr. Villamil's testimony on grounds of surprise.  Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 60(b)(1); P rez-P rez  v. Popular Leasing Rental,\n                                                                 \n\nInc., 993 F.2d 281, 283 (1st Cir. 1993).\n    \n\n          At the time  of Mr. Villamil's testimony,  Rubbermaid's\n\ncounsel objected on  the ground that Mr.  Villamil was presenting\n\nnew computations to the jury not contained in his first or second\n\nreport.  The  court overruled Rubbermaid's  objection, indicating\n\nthat Mr. Villamil was  entitled to criticize constructively Ernst\n\n&amp; Young's  report.   When ruling  on Rubbermaid's objection,  the\n\ndistrict  court stated  that Rubbermaid  was entitled  to \"cross-\n\nexamine him in light of not  only this analysis he is making here\n\n                    \n\n5  The court appointed expert estimated the present value of lost\npre-tax profits at $585,951.\n\n                               -7-\n\ntoday but in  relation to the analysis he  has made previously of\n\nthe reports you have rendered and which you have a copy and which\n\nwere the object of the deposition.\"\n\n          Rubbermaid knew that  Mr. Villamil was  going to be  an\n\nexpert witness at trial.  Moreover, Rubbermaid  was very familiar\n\nwith the subject matter upon which he would render his testimony.\n\nRubbermaid had ample opportunity  to cross-examine Mr.  Villamil.\n\nEven  if   Rubbermaid  had  been  surprised   by  Mr.  Villamil's\n\ntestimony,  the appropriate remedy would  have been to  ask for a\n\ncontinuance to  allow Rubbermaid to prepare  for the presentation\n\nof rebuttal testimony.  Szeliga v. General Motors Corp., 728 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n566  (1st Cir. 1984) (the remedy for surprise in the introduction\n\nof evidence is  not to  seek reversal after  an unfavorable  jury\n\nverdict, but  a  request for  continuance  at the  time  surprise\n\noccurs).   Rubbermaid did not request a continuance, a sidebar or\n\neven a limiting  jury instruction.   See  Smith v.  Massachusetts\n                                                                 \n\nInstitute of  Technology, 877  F.2d 1106 (1st  Cir. 1989),  cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 493 U.S. 965 (1989) (courts look with disfavor on parties\n      \n\nwho claim  surprise but who do  not ask for a recess  so they may\n\nattempt to counter the opponent testimony).\n\n          Rubbermaid  also claims  that Mr.  Villamil's testimony\n\nwas inadmissible pursuant to Fed. R. Evid.  702, 703, 705 and 403\n\nand  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 26(e).   We find Rubbermaid's  claims to be\n\nwithout merit.\n\n          The admissibility  of opinion evidence by  experts is a\n\nmatter   within  the  discretion  of  the  trial  court  and  its\n\n                               -8-\n\ndetermination of admissibility should be sustained unless clearly\n\nerroneous.

The district court's\n   \n\nrefusal to exclude Mr. Villamil's  testimony under Rule 403  does\n\nnot present  such  an  extraordinary  circumstance.    Rubbermaid\n\nsuggests  that  Mr.  Villamil's   testimony  had  the  effect  of\n\nconfusing and misleading  the jury and should have  been excluded\n\nunder Rule 403.   We disagree.   Mr. Villamil  was Newell's  only\n\nexpert as to damages.   Newell was entitled to  present witnesses\n\non  the  issue of  damages.   At  trial, Rubbermaid  conceded Mr.\n\nVillamil's  qualifications as an expert in this area.  Juries are\n\noften  asked to determine complex  issues of fact after listening\n\nto expert testimony.  Rubbermaid  was able to cross-examine  both\n\nMr. Villamil and the Ernst  &amp; Young expert as to  their testimony\n\nand to present  testimony by its own expert witness  on the issue\n\nof  damages.  In  light of these  factors, we do  not believe the\n\ndistrict  court abused  its  discretion in  determining that  Mr.\n\nVillamil's testimony had substantial probative value that was not\n\noutweighed by unfair  prejudice and should not  be excluded under\n\nRule 403.\n\n          Rubbermaid's argument that Mr. Villamil's testimony was\n\ninadmissible pursuant  to  Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 26(e)10  is  equally\n\n                    \n\n10  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(e) states:\n\n            Supplementation  of  Responses.

In essence, Rubbermaid argues that Mr. Villamil's\n\nopinion testimony  proffered during trial was  different from the\n\nopinions  he rendered  during  the pretrial  litigation and  that\n\nNewell failed to  supplement and amend its discovery responses as\n\nrequired by Rule 26(e) to reflect those differences.\n\n          \"[I]n  reviewing  a contention  that  answers were  not\n\nproperly  supplemented within  the  strictures of  Rule 26(e),  a\n\ncourt should look to the conduct  of the trial, the importance of\n\nthe evidence to its  proponent, and the ability of  the [opposing\n\n                    \n\n            complete when  made is  under no duty  to\n            supplement   the   response  to   include\n            information  thereafter  acquired, except\n            as follows:\n\n            (1)   A party is under  a duty seasonably\n            to supplement the  response with  respect\n            to any question directly addressed to (A)\n            the  identity  and  location  of  persons\n            having knowledge of discoverable matters,\n            and  (B)  the  identity  of  each  person\n            expected   to  be  called  as  an  expert\n            witness at  trial, the subject  matter on\n            which the person is expected  to testify,\n            and   the   substance  of   the  person's\n            testimony.\n\n            (2)   A party is under  a duty seasonably\n            to amend  a prior  response if  the party\n            obtains  information  upon  the basis  of\n            which   (A)  the  party  knows  that  the\n            response was incorrect  when made, or (B)\n            the party knows that the  response though\n            correct when  made is no longer  true and\n            the circumstances are such that a failure\n            to amend  the response is in  substance a\n            knowing concealment.\n\n            (3)  A duty  to supplement responses  may\n            be  imposed  by   order  of  the   court,\n            agreement of the parties,  or at any time\n            prior  to trial through  new requests for\n            supplementation of prior responses.\n\n                               -12-\n\nparty] to formulate a response.\"  Thibeault v.

It is not unusual for experts to make changes in their\n\nopinions  and revise  their  analyses and  reports frequently  in\n\npreparation  for, and  sometimes even  during, a  trial.   In the\n\npresent  case, the  parties  did not  stipulate  that they  would\n\naccept  without question the findings of Ernst &amp; Young, the court\n\nappointed  expert.   Newell was  therefore  entitled to  have its\n\nexpert,  Mr. Villamil,  criticize the  Ernst &amp;  Young report  and\n\ntestimony in  an attempt to discredit that  report and testimony.\n\nMr.  Villamil was  Newell's only  expert on  damages, hence,  Mr.\n\nVillamil's testimony was a very important part of  Newell's case.\n\nIf counsel for Rubbermaid  felt ill-prepared to cross-examine Mr.\n\nVillamil  when  faced  with  his testimony  at  trial,  counsel's\n\nsolution was to request  a continuance.

According  to\n\nNewell,  Rubbermaid took  actions which  were detrimental  to the\n\nestablished  relationship and  which  violated  the  Distribution\n\nAgreement by:\n\n          1.  making direct sales to retailers;\n\n          2.  imposing unreasonable sales quotas on Newell;\n\n          3.   reclassifying some  of its housewares  products to\n\ntake          them out of the Distribution Agreement; and\n\n          4.   delaying and refusing  to service orders placed by\n\n              Newell.\n\n          The Puerto  Rico Dealer's Contract Act,  P.R.

Section 278(d) of the Act\n\ndefines \"just cause\" as follows:\n\n            nonperformance  of  any of  the essential\n            obligations of the  dealer's contract  on\n            the part of the  dealer, or any action or\n            omission on  his part that  adversely and\n            substantially affects the interest of the\n            principal  or  grantor  in promoting  the\n            marketing   or    distribution   of   the\n            merchandise or service.\n\n          By   its  terms,  Law  75  sets   forth  a  variety  of\n\ncircumstances  under  which, once  a  dealer has  shown  that the\n\nsupplier terminated  its contract, the supplier  bears the burden\n\nof showing just cause for the termination.  Section 278a-1 of the\n\nAct,  which  bears  the  heading,  Just  cause  for  termination;\n                                                                 \n\nexceptions;  presumptions, sheds  light on  the mechanics  of the\n                         \n\njust cause exception.   Section 278a-1(a) of  the Act establishes\n\nthat certain  violations or  nonperformance  by a  dealer of  any\n\nprovision  included  in  the  dealer's  contract  \"shall  not  be\n\nconsidered as  being just cause  unless the principal  or grantor\n                                                                 \n\nshows  that  such nonperformance  may  affect, or  has  truly and\n     \n\n                               -15-\n\neffectively affected  the interests of such  principal or grantor\n\nin an adverse  or substantial  manner in the  development of  the\n\nmarket, distribution of the merchandise or rendering of services\"\n\n(emphasis  added).  Hence, under  this section, in  order to show\n\njust cause, the  supplier bears  the burden of  showing that  the\n\ndealer's violations or  nonperformance of the  contract adversely\n\naffected the suppliers interests.\n\n          It   is   uncontested   that  Rubbermaid   unilaterally\n\nterminated the Distribution Agreement.  Rubbermaid sought to show\n\njust cause under Law 75 by arguing that termination was justified\n\nbecause Newell  failed to  achieve assigned sales  objectives and\n\nexperienced  a decline in sales of  Rubbermaid products, and that\n\nNewell's sale of  other product lines, not related to Rubbermaid,\n\ncreated a  conflict of  interest detrimental to  the Distribution\n\nAgreement between Newell and  Rubbermaid and therefore, adversely\n\naffected Rubbermaid's  interests.   Newell presented  evidence to\n\ncounter these  allegations from  which the jury  could reasonably\n\nconclude that Rubbermaid did not have just cause to terminate the\n\nDistribution Agreement.  Newell's evidence included testimony  to\n\nthe effect that  any decline  in Rubbermaid sales  by Newell  was\n\ncaused  by   Rubbermaid's  own   actions  in  violation   of  the\n\nDistribution Agreement.  In particular, Newell presented evidence\n\nindicating  that  Rubbermaid  was selling  products  directly  to\n\nPitusa (a retail store in Puerto  Rico) at the same price it sold\n\nto Newell, undercutting the  ability of Newell to compete  on the\n\nPuerto Rican  market for  sales of Rubbermaid  products.   Newell\n\n                               -16-\n\nalso  presented  evidence   indicating  that  plastic   houseware\n\nproducts manufactured  by Newell which, according  to Rubbermaid,\n\ncreated a conflict of interest with Rubbermaid products, had been\n\nmanufactured  by  Anchor  P.R.   since  1968  and  competed  with\n\nRubbermaid  products  for  the   entire  span  of  the  contract.\n\nNewell's  evidence indicated  that there  was no  new competition\n\nintroduced  by the Newell acquisition of Anchor P.R. or any other\n\nconflict  in  interest  that  would justify  termination  of  the\n\nDistribution Agreement.\n\n          Newell also  presented evidence to the  effect that its\n\nassigned  sales objectives did not adjust to the realities of the\n\nPuerto Rican  market.  This  evidence included  testimony to  the\n\neffect that the  sales objectives were unreasonable.  Newell also\n\npresented evidence  to the jury in the form of an analysis of its\n\nsales  activities from 1986 to  1990.  The  analysis purported to\n\nshow  that  Newell's sales  were  adversely  affected by  several\n\nfactors, including Hurricane Hugo and direct sales by Rubbermaid,\n\nbut that overall, the company was successfully selling Rubbermaid\n\nproducts.\n\n          Section  278a-1(c)  establishes  that  where  a  dealer\n\nviolates  a provision in the agreement fixing rules of conduct or\n\nsetting  distribution quotas or goals  because it does not adjust\n\nto the  realities of  the Puerto Rican  market at  the time,  the\n\nviolation  will not  be deemed  just cause  and \"[t]he  burden of\n\nproof to show the reasonableness of the rule of conduct or of the\n\nquota  or goal  fixed shall  rest on  the principal  or grantor.\"\n\n                               -17-\n\nUnder this  section, once Newell presented  evidence showing that\n\nthe  assigned sales objectives did not adjust to the realities of\n\nthe Puerto Rican market,  it was Rubbermaid's burden to  show the\n\nreasonableness  of  the sales  objectives.    In finding  against\n\nRubbermaid, the jury concluded that  Rubbermaid did not meet  its\n\nburden.   Judging the credibility  of the witnesses  and weighing\n\nthe  evidence  are within  the  exclusive province  of  the jury.\n\nUnited  States  v.

We will  not\n                           \n\nsubstitute our judgment for  that of the jury in  its evidentiary\n\nfindings.   After  reviewing  the record,  we  conclude that  the\n\njury's verdict is not against the clear weight of the evidence.\n\n             ATTORNEYS' FEES &amp; PRE-JUDGMENT INTEREST\n\n          Newell  appeals the  district  court's  denial  of  its\n\nmotion  for attorneys'  fees and  pre-judgment interest.

A  reasonable\n            reviewer of this record may conclude that\n            the defendant's  case presented plausible\n            positions    that     merited    contract\n            termination.    The  fact  that  the jury\n            elected  otherwise  is not  indicative of\n            contumacious conduct  on the part  of the\n            defendant.\n\n           After reviewing the record, we agree with the district\n\ncourt in its  conclusion that  Rubbermaid did not  act rashly  or\n\ncontumaciously in  defending  this suit.    Rubbermaid  presented\n\nevidence  in  support  of  its defense,  indicating  that  Newell\n\nexperienced a decline  in sales of Rubbermaid products and failed\n\nto  meet assigned  sales objectives.   Rubbermaid  also presented\n\nevidence to the effect  that Newell's policies as to  the pricing\n\nof Rubbermaid  products and  Newell's sale of  houseware plastics\n\nthat  were  not  manufactured  by Rubbermaid  adversely  affected\n\nRubbermaid's interests.     The district court did not  abuse its\n\ndiscretion  in denying  Newell's motion  for attorneys'  fees and\n\npre-judgment interest.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -20-\n",

(\"Newell\"),  brought  an  action for  damages\n\nagainst  Rubbermaid  Incorporated  (\"Rubbermaid\"), alleging  that\n\nRubbermaid,  without  just  cause,  terminated  and impaired  the\n\nexclusive  distribution  agreement  between  the  two  parties in\n\nviolation of the Puerto Rico Dealers' Act, commonly known as \"Law\n\n75.\"  P.R.

The jury  found that Rubbermaid\n\nterminated  the distribution  agreement  without  just cause  and\n\nawarded Newell $1,400,000  in damages.   Rubbermaid then filed  a\n\nmotion for a new  trial.  The district court  denied Rubbermaid's\n\nmotion and  entered judgment against Rubbermaid.   Rubbermaid now\n\nappeals  the  court's  denial of  its  motion  for  a new  trial.\n\nSpecifically,  Rubbermaid argues  that  (1)  the  district  court\n\nabused its  discretion in admitting  certain testimony by  one of\n\nNewell's  expert  witnesses, and  (2) the  jury's finding  on the\n\nissue of just cause was against the clear weight of the evidence.\n\n          Newell  also filed  a motion  requesting pre  and post-\n\njudgment  interest  and  attorneys'  fees.

The Distribution Agreement\n\n          On May  31, 1968, Rubbermaid entered  into an agreement\n\nwith  Anchor  Hocking  Interamericana,  Ltd.  for  the  exclusive\n\ndistribution of  the Rubbermaid Houseware Product  Line in Puerto\n\nRico  and   the  United  States  Virgin   Islands  (\"Distribution\n\nAgreement\").   On March 28, 1972,  Anchor Hocking Interamericana,\n\nLtd.  assigned and  transferred  its rights  in the  Distribution\n\nAgreement to  Anchor Hocking Puerto Rico,  Ltd. (\"Anchor P.R.\").1\n\nFrom July  2,  1972 to  July  1, 1987,  Anchor  P.R., became  the\n\nexclusive  distributor of Rubbermaid Houseware Products in Puerto\n\nRico  and the Virgin  Islands.  On  July 2,  1987, Newell Company\n\nacquired  Anchor   Hocking  Corporation  and   its  subsidiaries,\n\nincluding Anchor  P.R. and thereafter continued  the distribution\n\nof Rubbermaid products in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\n          On October 31, 1991, Rubbermaid notified Newell that it\n\nwas terminating  the Distribution Agreement,  effective in ninety\n\ndays, because  Anchor P.R.  had been  unable to  achieve assigned\n\nsales objectives  and because Newell manufactured and distributed\n\nsimilar  products which  created a  conflict of  interest  in its\n\ndistribution of Rubbermaid products.   Rubbermaid then terminated\n\n                    \n\n1  Anchor Hocking Puerto Rico, Ltd. was a wholly owned subsidiary\nof Anchor Hocking Corporation  which was incorporated in Delaware\non  March  27, 1972,  for the  purpose  of acquiring  and selling\nproducts in Puerto Rico.\n\n                               -4-\n\nthe Distribution  Agreement.   The effective date  of termination\n\nwas February 3,  1992.   Anchor P.R. changed  its name to  Newell\n\nPuerto  Rico, Ltd.  In February 1992, Newell brought suit against\n\nRubbermaid,  claiming  that   Rubbermaid's  termination  of   the\n\nDistribution Agreement was unjustified.\n\n          B.  Expert Witness Testimony\n\n          During the course of  discovery, in June 1992, Newell's\n\nexpert witness on damages, Mr. Jos  Villamil, submitted a written\n\nreport estimating Newell's damages  under Law 75.  In  July 1992,\n\nRubbermaid's expert,  Dr. El as R. Guti rrez,  submitted a report\n\nchallenging the  accuracy of the valuation  estimate presented by\n\nMr. Villamil, and  questioning whether the  estimate was prepared\n\naccording to acceptable professional standards.  Doctor Guti rrez\n\nconcluded  that major flaws were  present in the  methods used by\n\nMr. Villamil to  estimate damages, and these flaws had the effect\n\nof producing an upward bias in the estimated value of damages for\n\nthe Rubbermaid line of products.2\n\n          During  his  first  deposition  on  August   11,  1992,\n\nMr. Villamil  acknowledged that  he  inadvertently  included  the\n\nvalue of the Rubbermaid Commercial Products Line, which is not at\n\nissue in this case,  in his valuation of damages.3   Accordingly,\n\nMr. Villamil agreed to  adjust his estimate and submit an amended\n\n                    \n\n2    Doctor Guti rrez  estimated  damages,  including a  goodwill\ncomponent, to be between $247,686 and $269,431.\n\n3   The  Distribution  Agreement which  is  the subject  of  this\nlawsuit  concerns the  Rubbermaid Houseware  Products Line.   The\nRubbermaid Commercial  Products Line  is a separate  and distinct\nline of products not relevant to this case.\n\n                               -5-\n\nreport reflecting his new  evaluation.  On August 13,  1992, four\n\ndays prior to  trial, Mr. Villamil submitted  an amended report.4\n\nAccording  to  Rubbermaid,  this  amended   report  included  new\n\ncalculations   using  a   methodology  and   valuation  procedure\n\ndifferent from that used  in Mr. Villamil's previous report.   On\n\nAugust  13, the court ordered  that both experts  be deposed anew\n\nand that transcripts of  the depositions be filed not  later than\n\nAugust  27, 1992.   The  Court further  determined that  it would\n\nappoint  an economist to render  a neutral expert  report.  Trial\n\nwas rescheduled for December 21, 1992.\n\n          Mr.  Villamil was  deposed  again on  August 20,  1992.\n\nDuring  this deposition,  Mr.  Villamil again  acknowledged  that\n\ncorrections  should be made to  his calculations.   On August 27,\n\n1992, Rubbermaid filed a \"Motion to Disqualify Plaintiff's Expert\n\nWitness, Exclude  Plaintiff's Expert Witness Reports  and Request\n\nfor Sanctions.\"  The court denied this motion.\n\n          On December 8, 1992,  the court appointed expert, Ernst\n\n&amp;  Young,  rendered  a report  which  included  a  review of  the\n\ndifferent reports  filed by the expert witnesses  for the parties\n\nand an independent calculation of a value or a range of values of\n\ndamages  for the distribution agreement under Law 75.  On January\n\n19,  1993, due to additional  information provided by counsel for\n\nNewell, Ernst &amp;  Young supplemented  the December 8  report.   On\n\n                    \n\n4  In  his amended  report, Mr. Villamil  estimated damages,  not\nincluding goodwill, to be between $1,620,000  and $2,941,000.  He\nestimated goodwill  at $1,013,749 and therefore,  the total value\nof the distribution of the Rubbermaid product line in Puerto Rico\nat between $2,633,749 and $3,954,749.\n\n                               -6-\n\nFebruary 2, 1993, Ernst &amp; Young submitted a final report.5\n\n          During trial,  the court  heard testimony from  Ernst &amp;\n\nYoung  regarding its report.   Mr. Villamil then  testified as an\n\nexpert for Newell.   At trial, Rubbermaid expressly conceded that\n\nMr.  Villamil was qualified as an expert.  Mr. Villamil testified\n\nthat he believed his role was to evaluate Ernst &amp; Young's report.\n\nRubbermaid objected to Mr. Villamil's testimony on the grounds of\n\nsurprise, arguing  that his  expressed views were  different from\n\nand  inconsistent with the opinions rendered in his reports.  The\n\ncourt  overruled  the objection  and  permitted  Mr. Villamil  to\n\ntestify.\n\n                  ADMISSION OF EXPERT TESTIMONY\n\n          Rubbermaid  challenges  the   admission  at  trial   of\n\nMr. Villamil's testimony on grounds of surprise.

The  court overruled Rubbermaid's  objection, indicating\n\nthat Mr. Villamil was  entitled to criticize constructively Ernst\n\n&amp; Young's  report.   When ruling  on Rubbermaid's objection,  the\n\ndistrict  court stated  that Rubbermaid  was entitled  to \"cross-\n\nexamine him in light of not  only this analysis he is making here\n\n                    \n\n5  The court appointed expert estimated the present value of lost\npre-tax profits at $585,951.\n\n                               -7-\n\ntoday but in  relation to the analysis he  has made previously of\n\nthe reports you have rendered and which you have a copy and which\n\nwere the object of the deposition.\"\n\n          Rubbermaid knew that  Mr. Villamil was  going to be  an\n\nexpert witness at trial.

The district court's\n   \n\nrefusal to exclude Mr. Villamil's  testimony under Rule 403  does\n\nnot present  such  an  extraordinary  circumstance.    Rubbermaid\n\nsuggests  that  Mr.  Villamil's   testimony  had  the  effect  of\n\nconfusing and misleading  the jury and should have  been excluded\n\nunder Rule 403.   We disagree.   Mr. Villamil  was Newell's  only\n\nexpert as to damages.   Newell was entitled to  present witnesses\n\non  the  issue of  damages.   At  trial, Rubbermaid  conceded Mr.\n\nVillamil's  qualifications as an expert in this area.  Juries are\n\noften  asked to determine complex  issues of fact after listening\n\nto expert testimony.  Rubbermaid  was able to cross-examine  both\n\nMr. Villamil and the Ernst  &amp; Young expert as to  their testimony\n\nand to present  testimony by its own expert witness  on the issue\n\nof  damages.  In  light of these  factors, we do  not believe the\n\ndistrict  court abused  its  discretion in  determining that  Mr.\n\nVillamil's testimony had substantial probative value that was not\n\noutweighed by unfair  prejudice and should not  be excluded under\n\nRule 403.\n\n          Rubbermaid's argument that Mr. Villamil's testimony was\n\ninadmissible pursuant  to  Fed.

In essence, Rubbermaid argues that Mr. Villamil's\n\nopinion testimony  proffered during trial was  different from the\n\nopinions  he rendered  during  the pretrial  litigation and  that\n\nNewell failed to  supplement and amend its discovery responses as\n\nrequired by Rule 26(e) to reflect those differences.\n\n          \"[I]n  reviewing  a contention  that  answers were  not\n\nproperly  supplemented within  the  strictures of  Rule 26(e),  a\n\ncourt should look to the conduct  of the trial, the importance of\n\nthe evidence to its  proponent, and the ability of  the [opposing\n\n                    \n\n            complete when  made is  under no duty  to\n            supplement   the   response  to   include\n            information  thereafter  acquired, except\n            as follows:\n\n            (1)   A party is under  a duty seasonably\n            to supplement the  response with  respect\n            to any question directly addressed to (A)\n            the  identity  and  location  of  persons\n            having knowledge of discoverable matters,\n            and  (B)  the  identity  of  each  person\n            expected   to  be  called  as  an  expert\n            witness at  trial, the subject  matter on\n            which the person is expected  to testify,\n            and   the   substance  of   the  person's\n            testimony.\n\n            (2)   A party is under  a duty seasonably\n            to amend  a prior  response if  the party\n            obtains  information  upon  the basis  of\n            which   (A)  the  party  knows  that  the\n            response was incorrect  when made, or (B)\n            the party knows that the  response though\n            correct when  made is no longer  true and\n            the circumstances are such that a failure\n            to amend  the response is in  substance a\n            knowing concealment.\n\n            (3)  A duty  to supplement responses  may\n            be  imposed  by   order  of  the   court,\n            agreement of the parties,  or at any time\n            prior  to trial through  new requests for\n            supplementation of prior responses.\n\n                               -12-\n\nparty] to formulate a response.\"  Thibeault v.

Section 278(d) of the Act\n\ndefines \"just cause\" as follows:\n\n            nonperformance  of  any of  the essential\n            obligations of the  dealer's contract  on\n            the part of the  dealer, or any action or\n            omission on  his part that  adversely and\n            substantially affects the interest of the\n            principal  or  grantor  in promoting  the\n            marketing   or    distribution   of   the\n            merchandise or service.\n\n          By   its  terms,  Law  75  sets   forth  a  variety  of\n\ncircumstances  under  which, once  a  dealer has  shown  that the\n\nsupplier terminated  its contract, the supplier  bears the burden\n\nof showing just cause for the termination.  Section 278a-1 of the\n\nAct,  which  bears  the  heading,  Just  cause  for  termination;\n                                                                 \n\nexceptions;  presumptions, sheds  light on  the mechanics  of the\n                         \n\njust cause exception.   Section 278a-1(a) of  the Act establishes\n\nthat certain  violations or  nonperformance  by a  dealer of  any\n\nprovision  included  in  the  dealer's  contract  \"shall  not  be\n\nconsidered as  being just cause  unless the principal  or grantor\n                                                                 \n\nshows  that  such nonperformance  may  affect, or  has  truly and\n     \n\n                               -15-\n\neffectively affected  the interests of such  principal or grantor\n\nin an adverse  or substantial  manner in the  development of  the\n\nmarket, distribution of the merchandise or rendering of services\"\n\n(emphasis  added).  Hence, under  this section, in  order to show\n\njust cause, the  supplier bears  the burden of  showing that  the\n\ndealer's violations or  nonperformance of the  contract adversely\n\naffected the suppliers interests.\n\n          It   is   uncontested   that  Rubbermaid   unilaterally\n\nterminated the Distribution Agreement.  Rubbermaid sought to show\n\njust cause under Law 75 by arguing that termination was justified\n\nbecause Newell  failed to  achieve assigned sales  objectives and\n\nexperienced  a decline in sales of  Rubbermaid products, and that\n\nNewell's sale of  other product lines, not related to Rubbermaid,\n\ncreated a  conflict of  interest detrimental to  the Distribution\n\nAgreement between Newell and  Rubbermaid and therefore, adversely\n\naffected Rubbermaid's  interests.   Newell presented  evidence to\n\ncounter these  allegations from  which the jury  could reasonably\n\nconclude that Rubbermaid did not have just cause to terminate the\n\nDistribution Agreement.  Newell's evidence included testimony  to\n\nthe effect that  any decline  in Rubbermaid sales  by Newell  was\n\ncaused  by   Rubbermaid's  own   actions  in  violation   of  the\n\nDistribution Agreement.  In particular, Newell presented evidence\n\nindicating  that  Rubbermaid  was selling  products  directly  to\n\nPitusa (a retail store in Puerto  Rico) at the same price it sold\n\nto Newell, undercutting the  ability of Newell to compete  on the\n\nPuerto Rican  market for  sales of Rubbermaid  products.   Newell\n\n                               -16-\n\nalso  presented  evidence   indicating  that  plastic   houseware\n\nproducts manufactured  by Newell which, according  to Rubbermaid,\n\ncreated a conflict of interest with Rubbermaid products, had been\n\nmanufactured  by  Anchor  P.R.   since  1968  and  competed  with\n\nRubbermaid  products  for  the   entire  span  of  the  contract.\n\nNewell's  evidence indicated  that there  was no  new competition\n\nintroduced  by the Newell acquisition of Anchor P.R. or any other\n\nconflict  in  interest  that  would justify  termination  of  the\n\nDistribution Agreement.\n\n          Newell also  presented evidence to the  effect that its\n\nassigned  sales objectives did not adjust to the realities of the\n\nPuerto Rican  market.  This  evidence included  testimony to  the\n\neffect that the  sales objectives were unreasonable.  Newell also\n\npresented evidence  to the jury in the form of an analysis of its\n\nsales  activities from 1986 to  1990.  The  analysis purported to\n\nshow  that  Newell's sales  were  adversely  affected by  several\n\nfactors, including Hurricane Hugo and direct sales by Rubbermaid,\n\nbut that overall, the company was successfully selling Rubbermaid\n\nproducts.\n\n          Section  278a-1(c)  establishes  that  where  a  dealer\n\nviolates  a provision in the agreement fixing rules of conduct or\n\nsetting  distribution quotas or goals  because it does not adjust\n\nto the  realities of  the Puerto Rican  market at  the time,  the\n\nviolation  will not  be deemed  just cause  and \"[t]he  burden of\n\nproof to show the reasonableness of the rule of conduct or of the\n\nquota  or goal  fixed shall  rest on  the principal  or grantor.\"\n\n                               -17-\n\nUnder this  section, once Newell presented  evidence showing that\n\nthe  assigned sales objectives did not adjust to the realities of\n\nthe Puerto Rican market,  it was Rubbermaid's burden to  show the\n\nreasonableness  of  the sales  objectives.    In finding  against\n\nRubbermaid, the jury concluded that  Rubbermaid did not meet  its\n\nburden.   Judging the credibility  of the witnesses  and weighing\n\nthe  evidence  are within  the  exclusive province  of  the jury.\n\nUnited  States  v.
