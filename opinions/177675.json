George A. O'Toole, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n                     Boudin, Dyk,* and Thompson,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Peter S.

The Defendants in this case\n\nmade   millions     off   infomercials         shilling    purported         panaceas,\n\nproducts that they claimed cured literally every disease, from\n\ncancer to Parkinson's to obesity.              Having been ordered to restore\n\nthese millions to the customers they deceived, the Defendants now\n\nraise a multitude of challenges to two decisions of the district\n\ncourt: first, the court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the\n\nplaintiff Federal Trade Commission (FTC), finding the Defendants\n\nliable   for      deceptive   advertising;        and     second,      the        court's\n\ndetermination      of   damages   after    a    bench     trial   on   that       issue.\n\nDespite the volume of the Defendants' arguments, we find no more\n\nsubstance    in    them   than    the     district      court     found      in    their\n\ninfomercials.      We therefore affirm the district court in toto.\n\n                                  I. BACKGROUND\n\nA. The Coral Calcium infomercial.\n\n            For purposes of introduction, a fairly simple recitation\n\nof only the uncontested facts will suffice.                 Greater detail will\n\nfollow as necessary in the discussion section.\n\n            The Defendants on appeal are Direct Marketing Concepts,\n\nInc. (DMC), ITV Direct, Inc. (ITV), Donald Barrett, Robert Maihos,\n\nand BP International (BP).1        Barrett and Maihos co-own ITV and DMC,\n\n\n1\n  We capitalize the word Defendant to refer to the Defendants on\nappeal, using lowercase when non-appellants are included, and\n\n                                        -3-\n\fboth   Massachusetts       corporations;        generally,       ITV     produces\n\ninfomercials, and DMC distributes the infomercials, answers calls,\n\nand processes orders. BP is a holding corporation to which Barrett\n\neventually (and secretly) transferred some of DMC's assets.\n\n            Beginning in late 2001, DMC, Barrett, and Maihos became\n\ninvolved in marketing the product Coral Calcium by producing and\n\ndistributing      an   infomercial   promoting        that    product.     These\n\nDefendants     then    processed   calls    and   sold       Coral   Calcium   to\n\nconsumers.\n\n            The infomercial for Coral Calcium relied on the purported\n\nexpertise    of   Robert   Barefoot.       In   the    infomercial,      Barefoot\n\nasserted a number of claims regarding coral-derived calcium2 and\n\nits supposed biological and medical properties.               Barefoot claimed\n\nthat all diseases are caused by a condition called acidosis:\n\n            Are you getting the minerals? And if you're\n            not, you will become acidic and you will get\n            one of the major diseases. You can have heart\n            disease, cancer, lupus, fibromyalgia, multiple\n            sclerosis.    Name the disease, they're all\n            caused by acidosis.\n\nBarefoot then claimed that calcium derived from Okinawan coral\n\ncures these diseases:\n\n\nproviding clarification as appropriate.\n2\n  The name of the product was not featured in the infomercial,\nwhich only referred generally to the purported healing properties\nof calcium derived from coral skeletons harvested off the coast of\nOkinawa, Japan.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f          [W]e've been studying the coral calcium and I\n          can tell you there are tens of millions of\n          people, millions of testimonials.    I've had\n          1,000 people tell me how they've cured their\n          cancer.   I've witnessed people get out of\n          wheelchairs with multiple sclerosis just by\n          getting on the coral.\n\nBarefoot asserted that coral-derived calcium was an effective cure\n\nfor these diseases because it renders the body more alkaline,\n\nthereby curing acidosis:\n\n          Barefoot: By the time the average American is\n          35, he has more calcium going out of his body\n          and into the body and that's when it starts.\n          By the time he's 60, 98 percent are totally\n          calcium deficient and that's why we have\n          people over 60 with heart disease, you know,\n          Lupus, Parkinson's.   All these diseases are\n          caused by acidosis.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Trudeau (host3): Pain, talk about pain. Read\n          in your book if a person has pain, muscle\n          pain, joint pain –\n\n          Barefoot: Yes, yes.\n\n          Trudeau: – they take calcium –\n\n          Barefoot: Yes.\n\n          Trudeau: – their body turns      from   acid   to\n          alkaline, pain goes away.\n\n          Barefoot: That's exactly –\n\n\n3\n  Host Kevin Trudeau's issues with the FTC present a whole other\nstory, set forth in FTC v. Trudeau, 579 F.3d 754, 757-62 (7th Cir.\n2009) (including a brief discussion of Trudeau's involvement with\nthe Coral Calcium infomercial).\n\n                                -5-\n\f             Trudeau: Is that common?\n\n             Barefoot: Yes, yes, very common.\n\nBarefoot went on to claim that coral-derived calcium is superior to\n\nother sources of calcium because it is 100% bioavailable, meaning\n\nthat all coral-derived calcium that is ingested is also absorbed\n\ninto   the   body.   To   bolster   his   claims,    Barefoot   noted    that\n\nunspecified articles from the Journal of the American Medical\n\nAssociation and the New England Journal of Medicine \"said that\n\ncalcium supplements reverse cancer . . . that's a quote.\"\n\n             The infomercial directed potential customers to call an\n\n800 number, on the other end of which DMC-employed telemarketers\n\nwould follow a script directing them to tell potential customers\n\nthat the product Coral Calcium would be 100% absorbed by their\n\nbodies and would combat degenerative diseases by rendering an\n\nacidic body more alkaline.      Telemarketers were also directed to\n\ntell sick customers that they should take higher doses of Coral\n\nCalcium, up to three times the standard dose.         During the relevant\n\ntime period (from January 2002 to July 2003), the Coral Calcium\n\ninfomercial     generated   $54,034,394.82      in     sales,    of     which\n\napproximately $575,000 were transferred to Defendant BP.\n\nB. The Supreme Greens infomercial.\n\n             As with Coral Calcium, the Defendants were involved\n\ncollectively in the production and airing of an infomercial for the\n\n                                    -6-\n\fproduct \"Supreme Greens,\" also called \"Supreme Greens with MSM.\"\n\nITV produced the infomercial, which Barrett hosted; DMC processed\n\ncalls and orders under Maihos's direction.\n\n          The   infomercial   for    Supreme   Greens   relied   on   the\n\npurported expertise of \"Dr.\" Alejandro Guerrero.4       Like Barefoot,\n\nGuerrero claimed that many major diseases are caused by acidosis,\n\nand that these diseases can be prevented and cured by rendering the\n\nbody more alkaline:\n\n          Barrett: Dr. Guerrero claims that most chronic\n          degenerative diseases – such as cancer,\n          arthritis, diabetes, even the number one\n          killer out there, heart disease – can and are\n          being cured . . . .\n\n          Guerrero: So if we can change the body's\n          fluids and tissues to a more alkaline base,\n          now you have an environment that is no longer\n          conducive for the proliferation or growth of a\n          degenerative condition. . . .\n\n          Barrett: . . . If I alkalize my body, am I\n          going to come up with one of these chronic\n          degenerative diseases?\n\n          Guerrero: No.\n\n          Barrett: Such as cancer, arthritis –\n\n          Guerrero: No. . . . I'm very confident in\n          saying that, primarily because of the clinical\n          studies we've done. I've seen it in my – in\n          my – clinical practice.    I've seen it every\n          day in my clinical practice.\n\n\n4\n  The infomercial presented Guerrero as a \"Doctor of Oriental\nMedicine,\" but Guerrero did not have any such degree.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fGoing beyond even Barefoot, Guerrero also claimed that Supreme\n\nGreens can cause weight loss by restoring alkalinity because \"fat\n\nis your body's way of protecting itself from the acidic fluids.\"\n\n          The infomercial directed potential customers to call an\n\n800 number, on the other end of which DMC-employed telemarketers\n\nwould follow a script directing them to ask potential customers\n\nabout their health issues and then explain how Supreme Greens\n\nsupposedly could address those issues.   For example, if a customer\n\nsaid she had cancer, the telemarketer was supposed to respond that\n\n\"cancer is acidosis of the body and Supreme Greens alkalizes the\n\nbody, and that's what you need, so you really want to take this.\"\n\nDuring the relevant time period (August 2003 to June 2004), Supreme\n\nGreens generated $14,683,436.24 in sales.\n\nC. The FTC action.\n\n          In June 2004, the FTC filed a complaint in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts against a\n\nnumber of parties,5 alleging violations of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 45 and 52.   The FTC sought both injunctive relief and monetary\n\nequitable relief in order to redress customers who had purchased\n\nCoral Calcium or Supreme Greens in reliance on the Defendants'\n\n\n\n5\n  Including, among others, the Defendants on appeal as listed\nabove, as well as Triad ML Marketing, Inc. (Triad), a corporation\nwhich will become relevant later.\n\n                                -8-\n\fallegedly deceptive infomercials. In July 2008, the district court\n\ngranted summary judgment against the Defendants on the issue of\n\nliability, holding that the challenged infomercials were misleading\n\nas a matter of law.        In August 2009, after a bench trial, the\n\ndistrict court entered two Final Orders and Judgments permanently\n\nenjoining the Defendants from running their deceptive infomercials\n\nand ordering disgorgement from the Defendants (excluding BP) in the\n\namount of $48,220,499.12 and from BP in the amount of $574,274.23.\n\nThe Defendants now appeal.\n\n                                 II. DISCUSSION\n\n            The Defendants take a shotgun approach to their appeal,\n\nasserting    that:   (1)   the    district   court   applied   an   incorrect\n\nstandard in finding them liable for deceptive advertising; (2) the\n\nrecord contained issues of fact as to whether they possessed\n\nsufficient    substantiation        for   the   claims   asserted    in   the\n\ninfomercials; (3) the claims made in the infomercials were mere\n\npuffery and were mollified by disclaimers, and therefore were not\n\nactionable; (4) Maihos is not individually liable as a matter of\n\nlaw; (5) the district court erred in calculating damages on the\n\nbasis of the Defendants' gross receipts rather than net profits;\n\n(6) the district court erred in determining damages from January\n\n2002 to February 2003; (7) the district court erred in determining\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fdamages from March 2003 to July 2003; and (8) the district court\n\nerred in determining damages from August 2003 to June 2004.\n\n          The FTC seeks to uphold the judgment of the district\n\ncourt in all respects, asserting that: (1) the district court\n\napplied a correct standard in finding the Defendants liable for\n\ndeceptive advertising; (2) the record contained vast swaths of\n\nuncontradicted evidence supporting the Defendants' lack of adequate\n\nsubstantiation for the claims asserted in the infomercials; (3) the\n\nclaims in the infomercials were specific and definite and therefore\n\nnot exempted from liability under the puffery or disclaimer rules;\n\n(4) as half-owner and officer of DMC, Maihos is individually\n\nliable; (5) the district court has broad discretion to fashion an\n\nequitable remedy, and exercised the discretion appropriately and in\n\naccordance with precedent; (6) the district court did not err in\n\ndetermining damages from January 2002 to February 2003; (7)     the\n\ndistrict court did not err in determining damages from March 2003\n\nto July 2003; and (8) the district court did not err in determining\n\ndamages from August 2003 to June 2004.\n\n          This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.   We\n\nreview de novo both the district court's decision to grant a\n\nsummary judgment motion, see Zimmerman v. Puccio, 613 F.3d 60, 70\n\n(1st Cir. 2010), and the district court's legal determinations\n\nafter a bench trial, overturning the district court's factual\n\n                               -10-\n\fdeterminations after a bench trial only in the case of clear error,\n\nsee Wojciechowicz v. United States, 582 F.3d 57, 66 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).       Applying these familiar standards to the Defendants'\n\narguments as appropriate, we see no need to diverge from the\n\ndistrict court on any point.\n\nA. The \"reasonable       basis\"    test     is   appropriate   for   deceptive\nadvertising claims.\n\n             The Defendants challenge both the legal and factual bases\n\nfor the district court's grant of summary judgment.              We begin by\n\nteasing out the applicable law.\n\n             Our starting point is the FTC statute, which provides\n\nthat both \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting\n\ncommerce\" (15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1)) and \"disseminat[ing], or caus[ing]\n\nto be disseminated, any false advertisement . . . in or having an\n\neffect upon commerce\" (15 U.S.C. § 52(a)) are \"unlawful.\"                   15\n\nU.S.C.   §    55   defines   the   term   \"false    advertisement\"     as   \"an\n\nadvertisement, other than labeling, which is misleading in a\n\nmaterial respect . . . .\"      Given the strong similarity between the\n\nterms \"deceptive\" and \"misleading\", it is no surprise that sections\n\n45 and 52 are sometimes applied in tandem as the basis for an FTC\n\naction against an alleged false advertiser; indeed, such a tandem\n\nreading is expressly allowed by 15 U.S.C. § 52(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f           When the FTC brings an action based on the theory that\n\nadvertising     is    deceptive       because    the     advertisers      lacked     a\n\nreasonable basis for their claims, the FTC must: (1) demonstrate\n\n\"what evidence would in fact establish such a claim in the relevant\n\nscientific     community\";      and     (2)     \"compare[]    the       advertisers'\n\nsubstantiation       evidence   to     that     required     by   the    scientific\n\ncommunity to see if the claims have been established.\"                   Removatron\n\nIntern. Corp. v. FTC, 884 F.2d 1489, 1498 (1st Cir. 1989) (applying\n\nto administrative determination of deceptive advertising); see also\n\nFTC v. Garvey, 383 F.3d 891, 901 (9th Cir. 2004) (applying the same\n\ntest to claims by FTC in court).                 Where the advertisers lack\n\nadequate     substantiation     evidence,        they    necessarily      lack     any\n\nreasonable basis for their claims.               See Removatron, 884 F.2d at\n\n1498.   And where the advertisers so lack a reasonable basis, their\n\nads are deceptive as a matter of law.              Id.\n\n           The Defendants argue that there is a third prong to a\n\ndeceptive advertising claim, asserting that the FTC was required –\n\nand failed – to prove that the infomercials were actually false.\n\nHowever, that argument is at odds with the cases cited above.\n\nIndeed, the Defendants cannot point to any source adequate to\n\ndisrupt the FTC's and district court's firm grounding in case law.6\n\n\n6\n  The Defendants do cite to a footnote in FTC v. Enforma Natural\nProducts, Inc., 362 F.3d 1204 (9th Cir. 2004), for the proposition\n\n                                        -12-\n\f          Instead, the Defendants cite haphazardly to a federal\n\nstatute (the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994,\n\nPub. L. No. 103-417, 108 Stat. 4325), whose legal relevance (if\n\nany) the Defendants never explain, and to a smattering of First\n\nAmendment case law, without engaging in any application of those\n\nsources or attempting to produce so much as a rough sketch of a\n\nrule that might support their proposition.    We can make neither\n\nheads nor tails of these citations, which have no clear relevance\n\nand which are completely devoid of context or developed argument.\n\nWe therefore hold that the Defendants have waived any argument they\n\nmight have raised under those sources, if any exists.   See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues\n\nadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort\n\nat developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").\n\n\n\n\nthat the FTC must prove actual falsity.         Id. at 1217 n.14.\nHowever, the Ninth Circuit's footnoted aside is grounded in the\nearlier case FTC v. Pantron I Corp., 33 F.3d 1088 (9th Cir. 1994),\nin which the court recognized that the FTC had abandoned a\nreasonable basis claim and was expressly proceeding on a theory of\nactual falsity.    See 33 F.3d at 1096 (\"discuss[ing] only the\nfalsity theory\" because \"the F.T.C. clearly and expressly abandoned\nthe reasonable basis theory\").      Thus, Pantron recognized the\ndistinction between a reasonable basis approach – the approach the\nFTC favors here – and a falsity approach. See id. And, contra the\nbald assertion in Enforma, the Pantron court stated plainly that \"a\nfalse advertisement need not even be false; it need only be\nmisleading in a material respect.\"      33 F.3d at 1099 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Thus, the statement in Enforma on which\nthe Defendants rely is not only dicta, but also incorrect.\n\n                               -13-\n\f              In   light   of   the   Defendants'   failure    to     raise    any\n\nprincipled objection to the \"reasonable basis\" framework, which was\n\ncarefully applied by the district court, the remainder of our\n\nanalysis will follow that framework.\n\nB. The Defendants produced no actual substantiation for their\nhealth claims.\n\n              We must now consider the application of the Removatron\n\n\"reasonable basis\" test to the record on summary judgment.                      To\n\nrecap,    under     this   test   (and   applying    the    summary    judgment\n\nstandard), we must determine whether there was uncontroverted\n\nevidence regarding: (1) what sort of evidence would scientifically\n\nestablish the claims the Defendants made in their infomercials; and\n\n(2)    whether     the   Defendants    were    actually    possessed    of    such\n\nevidence.      See Removatron, 884 F.2d at 1498.            It is uncontested\n\nthat    the   Defendants    asserted     the   following    claims     in    their\n\ninfomercials: (1) coral-derived calcium supplements cure cancer,\n\nmultiple sclerosis, and other degenerative diseases by rendering\n\nacidic bodies more alkaline, and they are 100% absorbed by the\n\nhuman body; and (2) Supreme Greens cure cancer and cause weight\n\nloss by rendering acidic bodies more alkaline. If these claims are\n\nnot supported by sufficient scientific evidence, then liability\n\nfollows.      The Defendants claim that there are issues of fact on\n\nboth prongs as applied to both infomercials.\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\f           On   the   first   prong,     the   FTC    produced   four     expert\n\ndeclarations    which    demonstrated      that      the   claims    could    be\n\nsubstantiated by double-blind, placebo-controlled human studies.\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Richard Wood averred that \"[i]t is generally\n\naccepted that human studies are required to support a scientific\n\nfinding concerning the bioavailability of a test compound in the\n\nhuman body.\" Dr. Maryfran Sowers provided specific examples of the\n\nscientific standards for, e.g., a chemical compound's effect on\n\nheart health: \"It is generally accepted among scientists that for\n\na test compound or product to be considered as having a clinically\n\nmeaningful effect on blood pressure, the changes in blood pressure\n\ncaused by the compound or test must reach certain established\n\nthresholds,\" which she then described in numerical detail.                    Dr.\n\nSowers   outlined     other   contours    of   reliability,      noting      that\n\nprospective studies of 50,000 and 90,000 subjects were \"considered\n\nvery reliable because of the large cohort involved and the breadth\n\nof information collected,\" whereas \"the early data collected in a\n\nlongitudinal    study    is   scientifically      suspect    until    adequate\n\ntemporal distance is established between when the calcium intake\n\ndata was collected and the time when new or incident blood pressure\n\ncould develop.\"       Dr. Landon King averred that \"[i]n order to\n\nevaluate whether an intervention compound . . . changed the pH\n\nbalance of the body, researchers would develop a protocol for a\n\n                                   -15-\n\fcontrolled clinical trial that would measure the subjects' pH\n\nbalance prior to receiving the test compound (or placebo) and at an\n\nappropriate period(s) after receiving either the test compound or\n\na placebo.\"   Dr. King noted specifically that \"[i]n order to claim\n\nthat a product increases alkalinity, reasonable scientists would\n\nexpect the product to have been subject to such an appropriate\n\nclinical study.\"     Dr. Barrie Cassileth averred that \"[t]he most\n\nscientifically valid way to determine whether Supreme Greens (or\n\nany other product) produces any results is a double-blind, placebo\n\ncontrolled study.\"\n\n          To be sure, there may be other scientific evidence that\n\ncould be sufficient, and we may assume for these purposes that a\n\ndouble-blind study is not necessarily required. But the government\n\nestablished   that     some   scientific      evidence    is   required     for\n\nsubstantiation,    and    thus    satisfied    the   first     prong   of   the\n\nRemovatron test.     Because the FTC produced affidavits which are\n\nmore than adequate on their face to satisfy the first prong of a\n\n\"reasonable   basis\"     claim,   and   because   the    Defendants    neither\n\nproduced nor pointed to any evidence to raise even the tiniest of\n\nfact issues, summary judgment was appropriate on the first prong.\n\n          On the second prong, the FTC relied on the same four\n\nexpert declarations, in which the experts compared the Defendants'\n\nevidence to the available literature and concluded in each case\n\n                                    -16-\n\fthat the Defendants' evidence was woefully inadequate. The experts\n\nspecifically opined that: (1) there was some evidence that calcium\n\nmight help to prevent colorectal cancer but no evidence that\n\ncalcium cures cancer; (2) there was some evidence that calcium\n\nmight lower blood pressure but none that it cures heart disease;\n\n(3) there was no evidence whatsoever that calcium has any effect on\n\nautoimmune disorders; (4) there has been no research published in\n\nthe Journal of the American Medical Association or the New England\n\nJournal of Medicine indicating that calcium \"reverses\" cancer; (5)\n\nthere is no evidence that any kind of calcium is 100% absorbed; (6)\n\nthere is no evidence that any disease is caused by \"an overly\n\nacidic body\"; (7) there is no evidence that alkalinity cures cancer\n\nor heart disease; (8) there is no evidence that any ingredient of\n\nSupreme Greens can prevent, treat, or cure cancer, heart disease,\n\nor diabetes; and (9) there is no evidence that Supreme Greens may\n\ncause weight loss.\n\n           The record contains a slew of other documents, including\n\nexcerpts from Barefoot's books, excerpts from Barefoot's deposition\n\ntestimony, excerpts from Guerrero's deposition testimony, a number\n\nof   popular   science   and    pseudoscientific     articles,     and   one\n\npreliminary    study.    The    Defendants   claim   that   this   evidence\n\nprovided   them   with   a     reasonable    basis   for    accepting    the\n\ninfomercials' claims as true.       However, it is clear that none of\n\n                                   -17-\n\fthis   material     comes   close   to   establishing      an    issue   of    fact\n\nregarding    the    Defendants'     woefully     inadequate      substantiation\n\nevidence.\n\n            Barefoot's      books   present      jumbles    of     quotes      from\n\nscientists, scientific review articles, and scientific studies\n\ninterspersed       with   references     to   Reader's     Digest    and      other\n\ngeneral-consumption reductions of these studies.                    His sources\n\nsupport such uncontroversial propositions as \"[t]he connection\n\nbetween the electrical activity of the cell and the release of the\n\nneurotransmitter is not direct; an essential intermediary is the\n\ncalcium ion.\"       Robert R. Barefoot & Carl J. Reich, The Calcium\n\nFactor (2000) (internal citation removed) (emphasis Barefoot's).\n\nHowever, none of these scientists or studies supports the panacean\n\nclaims made in the Coral Calcium infomercial; the claims are\n\nextrapolations,      distortions,      and    sometimes,    seemingly,        utter\n\nfabrications.      It appears to be no accident that neither Barefoot,\n\nnor any Defendant, nor any of the Defendants' attorneys has at any\n\npoint in these proceedings identified any particular scientific\n\nstudy or studies to support the specific claims presented in the\n\nCoral Calcium infomercial. Indeed, Barefoot's deposition testimony\n\nprimarily relies on appeals to generic authority; his standard\n\nrhetorical practice is to assert that there are myriad studies that\n\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fsupport a given claim, without identifying any specifically.7 When\n\npressed for specificity, he generally refers the questioner to his\n\nbooks.8   Nowhere in the record is there any support for, e.g., the\n\nfollowing   propositions:   all   diseases   are   caused   by   acidosis;\n\ncalcium supplements cure cancer; calcium supplements cure multiple\n\nsclerosis; or coral-derived calcium is 100% absorbed into the body.\n\n            Guerrero's testimony is even less compelling, given that\n\nhe relies primarily on his own general experience as an alternative\n\nmedicine practitioner, without reference to any studies at all.\n\nThe Defendants make much of a double-blind, controlled, but also\n\nunpublished and preliminary study, which they assert supports the\n\nhealth claims advanced in the Supreme Greens infomercial; however,\n\nthe study found, based on a sample size of sixteen people, that one\n\nof the ingredients in Supreme Greens – Methyl-Sulfonyl-Methane, or\n\n\n7\n  For example, Barefoot claims that he \"hired the No. 1 scientist\nin America . . . and he did a peer-review study all over the world\nand came up with thousands and thousands of references\"; and that\n\"I could load you up where it would take you ten years to get out\nof this building before you read all the people that say calcium\nprevents cancer\"; and that \"[t]ens of thousands of scientists are\nsaying that [calcium prevents cancer], and I can show you the\ndocuments.\"\n8\n  For example, when asked about the public availability of these\nuncountable studies, Barefoot said \"I have just finished a book\ncalled Let's Cure Humanity, in which I give you 1,000 scientific\nreferences. You're asking for them. I'm giving them to you. I\nwill also give you 100 scientific quotations from the world's best\nscientists, and the quotations are startling: reverses PMS, it\nreverses cancer; that it reverses diabetes . . . .\"\n\n                                  -19-\n\fMSM – might relieve arthritis pain and was therefore worthy of\n\nfurther study.   This study on its face is grossly insufficient to\n\nsupport the Defendants' claims of Supreme Greens' efficacy in\n\ntreating all diseases.      And even the abstracts and excerpts from\n\npseudoscientific   articles,   published      in   journals     such   as   the\n\nnon-peer reviewed and now-defunct Healthy & Natural Journal and\n\nNatural Way for Better Health, do not support the specific claims\n\nmade in either infomercial — e.g., there is no support for the\n\nclaims that the product Supreme Greens or any of their ingredients\n\ncure cancer, cure heart disease, or cause weight loss by alkalizing\n\nthe body and thereby curing its need for fat as a protection\n\nagainst acid.\n\n           Given the complete absence of support for the vast\n\nmajority of the Defendants' health claims – which absence the FTC's\n\nfour experts also testified to on the basis of their own literature\n\nreviews – we easily could conclude that the Defendants lacked\n\nadequate   substantiation    under    even   the   most   lax   standard    of\n\nscientific reliability.     Here, however, the FTC produced evidence\n\nestablishing a rigorous standard of scientific reliability, and the\n\nrecord reveals that the Defendants fell well and unquestionably\n\nshort of this standard.     In all, the strong evidence establishing\n\na scientific standard for evaluating the Defendants' advertising\n\nclaims, the overwhelming evidence supporting the Defendants' lack\n\n                                     -20-\n\fof substantiation evidence, and the failure of the Defendants to\n\nindicate any evidence to raise an issue of fact on either point,\n\ncompel the legal conclusion that the Defendants lacked a reasonable\n\nbasis for the health claims they used to sell their products.               Cf.\n\nRemovatron, 884 F.2d at 1498.         The Defendants therefore engaged in\n\ndeceptive advertising as a matter of law.               See id.\n\nC. The Defendants made specific health claims which were not cured\nby general disclaimers.\n\n              The Defendants attempt to head off the above analysis by\n\nasserting that their infomercials advanced no actual health claims\n\nbut, instead, presented only puffery which was further attenuated\n\nby the presence of general disclaimers.             Where a claim is merely\n\n\"exaggerated advertising, blustering, and boasting upon which no\n\nreasonable buyer would rely,\" it may be un-actionable puffery. See\n\nClorox Co. Puerto Rico v. Proctor & Gamble Comm. Co., 228 F.3d 24,\n\n38 (1st Cir. 2000) (quotation marks omitted).               However, \"specific\n\nand measurable\" claims and claims that may be literally true or\n\nfalse   are    not   puffery,   and   may    be   the   subject   of   deceptive\n\nadvertising claims.      Id. (quotation marks omitted).           As set forth\n\nabove, passim, the Defendants' infomercials presented specific and\n\nmeasurable      health   claims.       These      claims   included    definite\n\nstatements that coral calcium cures cancer, autoimmune diseases,\n\nand pain by rendering acidic bodies more alkaline, as well as\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fstatements that Supreme Greens cure cancer, heart disease, and\n\ncause weight loss by rendering acidic bodies more alkaline. Due to\n\ntheir specificity and concreteness, such claims go far beyond\n\npuffery as a matter of law.      See id. at 39.\n\n           The presence of disclaimers does not provide any more\n\nassistance   to     the   Defendants.        This   court      has   held   that\n\n\"[d]isclaimers or qualifications in any particular ad are not\n\nadequate to avoid liability unless they are sufficiently prominent\n\nand unambiguous to change the apparent meaning of the claims and to\n\nleave an accurate impression.           Anything less is only likely to\n\ncause   confusion    by   creating     contradictory     double      meanings.\"\n\nRemovatron, 884 F.2d at 1497.          The disclaimers at issue here did\n\nnothing to affect the meaning of the infomercials' health claims\n\nand were not even sufficient to cause confusion, given the clarity\n\nand concreteness of the claims. The infomercial transcripts reveal\n\nonly disclaimers that the infomercials are paid advertising.                 The\n\nDefendants   have    presented   no    concrete     evidence    of   any    other\n\nattenuating messages.9      In contrast, the health claims were bold\n\n\n9\n  The Defendants' brief claims that the infomercials contained\n\"disclaimers that stated the shows . . . expressed the opinions of\nthe speakers, and that the products were not intended to diagnose,\ntreat or cure any disease.\" The brief contains no record cites,\nand the only relevant evidence below (not included in the appendix\nbut pointed out at oral argument) is an affidavit from Luke\nGoljian, who testified that one version of the Supreme Greens\ninfomercial – the ninth edit, which was \"sent out on several\n\n                                      -22-\n\fand straightforward, presented by supposed experts as testable\n\nobservations backed up by clinical trials and studies.            Given the\n\nDefendants' lack of substantiation for these concrete claims framed\n\nby do-nothing disclaimers, we affirm the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment on the issue of the Defendants' liability for\n\ndeceptive advertising.\n\nD. Maihos is individually liable as an owner and corporate officer\nwho lacked appropriate substantiation.\n\n           The Defendants present one last argument on liability,\n\narguing   that    the   district    court      erred   in   holding   Maihos\n\nindividually     liable.      Individual       liability    for   deceptive\n\nadvertising is appropriate where an individual (1) was a corporate\n\nofficer   with   the    capacity   to   make    decisions    regarding   the\n\nchallenged conduct, and (2) knew or should have known that there\n\nwas no reasonable basis for the deceptive claims.            See, e.g., FTC\n\nv. Publishing Clearing House, Inc., 104 F.3d 1168, 1170 (9th Cir.\n\n\n\n\noccasions to stations\" during an indeterminate time frame – did\ninclude disclaimers fitting the description in the brief. But even\nassuming that these disclaimers actually accompanied either of the\nchallenged infomercials – despite the absence of any concrete\nsupport for that proposition in the record – such disclaimers would\nnot leave an accurate impression but instead would only cause\nconfusion. Cf. Removatron, 884 F.2d at 1497. A statement that\nstudies prove a product cures a certain disease, followed by a\ndisclaimer that the statement is opinion and the product actually\ndoes not cure the disease, leaves an overall impression of\nnonsense, not clarity.\n\n                                   -23-\n\f1997).   The FTC produced ample support for each proposition, and\n\nthe Defendants produced no evidence to the contrary.\n\n          The FTC produced evidence that Maihos was a 50% owner of\n\nDMC and ITV, that he controlled both companies' purse strings and\n\nday-to-day operations, and that he was the contact for an attorney\n\nretained to review the infomercials for their legality under\n\nfederal trade law.10   Maihos (ignoring his status as an officer and\n\nhalf-owner of DMC) focuses on gaps in his responsibilities, relying\n\non, e.g., his testimony that he did not edit the content of\n\nadvertising.   This is simply irrelevant.   The question is whether\n\nhe could have nipped the offending infomercials in the bud; the FTC\n\nproduced evidence that he could, and he has produced no evidence —\n\n\n\n10\n  Maihos also seeks to rely on two district court cases, both of\nwhich found straw officers and owners not individually liable. See\nFTC v. QT, Inc., 448 F. Supp. 2d 908, 973 (N.D.Ill. 2006)\n(corporate officer who \"had no involvement in the actions that led\nto corporate liability\" and \"has no set position and provides help\naround the office\" not liable); United States v. Building Inspector\nof America, Inc., 894 F. Supp. 507, 519-20 (D.Mass. 1995) (finding\nliability where \"founder and president['s]\" claim of no involvement\nwas \"entirely implausible\"; finding issue of fact as to liability\nfor vice president with no evidence of actual authority or direct\ninvolvement; and finding no liability for treasurer with no\nevidence of any authority or any involvement). Building Inspector\nrecognizes individual liability for a \"founder and president.\" See\n894 F. Supp. at 519. In addition to being a founder, Maihos was\nthe founding president of DMC.         Maihos's extensive duties,\ninvolvement, and ownership interest in the corporate Defendants\nbring him entirely outside the ambit of these non-controlling cases\nto the extent they find no liability for corporate officers. Cf.\nid.\n\n                                -24-\n\feven his own testimony — to indicate that he couldn't.            See FTC v.\n\nFreecom Comm., Inc., 401 F.3d 1192, 1205 (10th Cir. 2005) (finding\n\nindividual liability where \"[e]verybody knew that [the defendant]\n\nwas the principal shareholder of the company and his opinions and\n\nadvice and direction were listened to very carefully and were\n\ngenerally followed or heeded\").\n\n            On the second prong, Maihos's knowledge, the FTC produced\n\nMaihos's own deposition testimony admitting that DMC did not have\n\nany substantiation for the claims made in either infomercial.\n\nMaihos also testified about an email he received from his then-\n\ngirlfriend, a registered dietitian. The email provides both direct\n\nand circumstantial evidence of Maihos's knowledge.            The email is\n\ndirect evidence that the girlfriend informed Maihos that \"[c]alcium\n\nfrom   anything   cannot   be    100    percent   bioavailable\"    and   that\n\n\"[t]here's no evidence at all that Coral Calcium is better than\n\nordinary calcium or has any special health-boosting properties.\"\n\nThe girlfriend also asked Maihos, \"do you think there is a product\n\n([over the counter] no less) that can prevent heart disease,\n\ndiabetes,   arthritis   AND     cancer?\"      Maihos   testified    that    he\n\ndismissed the email as mere skepticism. However, the email is also\n\ncircumstantial     evidence     that    Maihos    actually   requested     the\n\ninformation from the girlfriend, who consulted third parties on\n\nMaihos's behalf.    The email begins, \"Hello, as requested here are\n\n                                       -25-\n\fthe responses I got.\"           It also attached an email from the address\n\nWic-talk@NAL.USDA.GOV, which a quick internet search reveals is an\n\nelectronic     discussion            group    promoted      by    the     United     States\n\nDepartment of Agriculture \"for use by individuals involved in\n\nproviding          nutrition             services.\"                 See       WIC-Talk,\n\nhttp://www.nal.usda.gov/wicworks/Talk/index.html (last visited Oct.\n\n19,   2010).       Thus,       the    imputed       exchange     giving    rise     to   the\n\ngirlfriend's email implies that Maihos himself questioned the\n\ninfomercials' claims.           The FTC also produced evidence that Maihos\n\nhad attended DMC meetings regarding the production of \"clean\" and\n\n\"re-edited\" versions of the infomercials while earlier versions of\n\nthe infomercials still ran.                  Finally, the FTC produced evidence\n\nthat an attorney suggested to Maihos in October 2003, well before\n\nthe Defendants pulled the Supreme Greens infomercial off the air,11\n\nthat the Supreme Greens infomercial required voluminous support and\n\nadvanced \"BS\" claims.\n\n            Again,       the    Defendants          point   to   nothing     that    might\n\nchallenge    any    of    this       evidence,       relying     instead    on     Maihos's\n\nprotestations that he sincerely believed in the infomercials'\n\n\n\n11\n  For example, there is evidence in the record that Donald Barrett\nsent an email to \"All Managers\" on February 23, 2004, stating that\n\"[w]e should now be using the original version Supreme Greens\" and\nthat a new version would \"be testing in April or the beginning of\nnext qtr.\"\n\n                                             -26-\n\fhealth claims.           It is true that two district court cases support\n\nthe proposition that sincere belief may be an element in the\n\nindividual liability calculus; however, even sincere belief is not\n\nsufficient here to overcome the overwhelming evidence that Maihos\n\nknew or, at the very least, should have known that the infomercials\n\nlacked any reasonable basis in scientific fact. See FTC v. Medical\n\nBillers Network, Inc., 543 F. Supp. 2d 283, 320-22 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)\n\n(finding individual liability); FTC v. Patriot Alcohol Testers,\n\nInc.,   798    F.    Supp.    851,     860   n.3    (D.Mass.    1992).      This    is\n\nparticularly        so    given    that    the    patent   ridiculousness    of    the\n\ninfomercials'        health       claims   was    presented    multiple   times     by\n\nmultiple people to Maihos, who chose to remain willfully blind.\n\nThus, there is no question that Maihos knew that the infomercials'\n\nclaims lacked substantiation, that he had the authority to control\n\nDMC and ITV, and, nevertheless, that he did little or nothing.                     The\n\ndistrict court did not err in holding Maihos individually liable\n\nfor deceptive advertising, and we affirm.\n\nE. Gross receipts are an appropriate basis for calculating damages.\n\n              Turning now to the issue of damages, the Defendants begin\n\nby arguing that damages for deceptive advertising are limited to\n\nactual profits, not gross receipts.                If this were so, then at least\n\npart of the district court's damages award would be erroneous.\n\nHowever, the law allows for broad discretion in fashioning a remedy\n\n                                           -27-\n\ffor     deceptive     advertising;     many     cases     uphold    rescission\n\n(effectively,       restoring   the   parties     to    pre-sale   status)   or\n\nrestitution (under these facts, the same) as appropriate remedies.\n\nSee Trudeau, 579 F.3d at 771 (noting that \"[c]onsumer loss is a\n\ncommon measure for civil sanctions in contempt proceedings and\n\ndirect FTC actions\" and listing cases).            Thus, consumer loss, as\n\nrepresented by the Defendants' gross receipts, would appear to be\n\nan appropriate measure of damages.\n\n            Nevertheless, the Defendants ask us to rely on FTC v.\n\nVerity Int'l, Ltd., 443 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 2006), for the proposition\n\nthat the FTC's remedy is limited to the Defendants' profits rather\n\nthan their gross receipts.        Verity's limited rule does not apply\n\nhere.\n\n            In Verity, a series of unrelated, non-party middlemen\n\npartook of the proceeds from the defendants' scheme before the\n\ndefendants themselves got a bite.            See 443 F.3d at 53 (describing\n\nthe relationship as a \"multitiered, cascading-payment structure\").\n\nThe court found this payment structure highly relevant to the issue\n\nof damages, noting that \"in many cases in which the FTC seeks\n\nrestitution, the defendant's gain will be equal to the consumer's\n\nloss\" but casting Verity's facts as an exception limited to the\n\nsituation \"when some middleman not party to the lawsuit takes some\n\nof the consumer's money before it reaches a defendant's hands.\"\n\n                                      -28-\n\fId. at 68 (emphasis added); see also Trudeau, 579 F.3d at 772\n\n(describing Verity as holding only that \"certain circumstances\n\nrequire courts to limit disgorgement to the defendant's profits\").\n\nHere, the Defendants seek to inflate Verity's exception so that it\n\novershadows the rule.\n\n          We are not persuaded.    Because this set of facts lacks\n\nthe non-party middleman that gave rise to the exception in Verity,\n\nwe will follow the general rule.      Here, the Defendants on appeal\n\ntook in proceeds directly, except for roughly one year when fellow\n\ndefendant (but non-appellant) Triad processed Coral Calcium orders.\n\nThe FTC introduced ample evidence of the overall proceeds from\n\nCoral Calcium during this period; however, the parties' financial\n\nrecords were in such disarray that the actual split among the\n\nparties could not be determined.12     The Defendants on appeal now\n\nclaim that Triad siphoned off the vast majority of the proceeds,\n\nleaving them holding an empty bag, but we cannot tell whether this\n\nis the case. Because every entity that had received consumer money\n\nwas a defendant, the district court held that gross receipts were\n\nan appropriate measure of damages; because records were unclear as\n\nto how much consumer money each defendant received, the district\n\n\n12\n  The FTC perhaps ought to have made more of an effort to nail down\nthe details of the parties' finances during discovery, as we also\nnote infra at 37-38, but there is no question that the primary\nfault lies with the Defendants.\n\n                               -29-\n\fcourt evenly split the total receipts between DMC and Triad for the\n\ntime period when Triad acted as a middleman.                    This was consistent\n\nwith   Verity    and   within       the    bounds     of   the       district     court's\n\ndiscretion in fashioning an equitable remedy.                        See Freecom, 401\n\nF.3d at 1202 n.6 (noting that the FTC Act's \"grant of authority to\n\nprovide   injunctive       relief    carries       with    it    the   full     range   of\n\nequitable      remedies,    including        the     power      to     grant     consumer\n\nredress\").\n\n              Thus, the district court committed no error in resting\n\nits damages determination on the Defendants' gross receipts rather\n\nthan their net profits, and we will proceed to review the court's\n\ncalculation     of   what   those     gross       receipts      actually     were.      To\n\ndetermine      the   appropriate          amount    of     damages      in      deceptive\n\nadvertising cases, courts apply a burden-shifting scheme.                         First,\n\nthe FTC must provide the court with a reasonable approximation of\n\ndamages.13     See FTC v. Febre, 128 F.3d 530, 535 (7th Cir. 1997).\n\nBoth gross receipts and net customer loss are appropriate measures.\n\nSee    id.;    Freecom,     401     F.3d    at     1206.        Once     a     reasonable\n\n\n13\n  The Defendants argue that the district court did not hold the FTC\nto its initial burden of proving a reasonable approximation of\ndamages, and therefore that the court engaged in premature burden\nshifting by relying on the Defendants' disheveled records as\nproffered by the FTC. This argument has no merit, as we uphold in\neach instance the evidentiary basis for the damages award and find\nthat the FTC presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a\nreasonable approximation of damages.\n\n                                           -30-\n\fapproximation of damages has been provided, the defendant has an\n\nopportunity to demonstrate that the figures are inaccurate.              See\n\nFebre, 128 F.3d at 535.      Any fuzzy figures due to a defendant's\n\nuncertain bookkeeping cannot carry a defendant's burden to show\n\ninaccuracy.    See id.    The district court and all parties find a\n\nrare point of agreement in the notion that this exercise may be\n\nbroken down into three constituent time periods – January 2002 to\n\nFebruary 2003, March 2003 to July 2003, and August 2003 to June\n\n2004 – each of which we will address in turn.\n\nF. The district court's determination of damages from January 2002\nto February 2003 was not erroneous.\n\n          The Defendants first challenge the propriety of the\n\ndamages award for sales of Coral Calcium from January 2002 to\n\nFebruary 2003, during which time DMC and fellow defendant (but non-\n\nappellant)    Triad   cooperated   to   sell   Coral   Calcium.   The   FTC\n\nintroduced Exhibit 185 to support a finding that these defendants\n\ncollectively received $40.9 million from sales of Coral Calcium\n\nfrom January 2002 to February 2003.        A witness – Steven Ritchey,\n\nTriad's vice president in charge of accounting – testified that\n\ngross receipts from this time period were $40.9 million.                Even\n\nDefendant Barrett testified that gross receipts from this time\n\nperiod were around $40 million. The district court credited all of\n\nthe above, found that gross receipts were $40.9 million, found that\n\n\n\n                                   -31-\n\fthe records were unclear on the exact division of proceeds between\n\nDMC and Triad, and therefore judiciously split the award in two.\n\nThis was all well within the court's discretion, and the Defendants\n\ndo not raise any serious argument to the contrary.\n\n            The Defendants do challenge Exhibit 185 as improperly\n\nadmitted. Although there is adequate evidence to support the\n\ndistrict court's determination even absent Exhibit 185, we will\n\nbriefly explain why that exhibit's admission was appropriate. Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 803(6) provides that business records may be admissible if\n\ncertified   according   to     Fed.   R.    Evid.   902(11).       Rule    902(11)\n\nprovides that \"a duplicate of a domestic record of regularly\n\nconducted activity\" is admissible \"if accompanied by a written\n\ndeclaration of its custodian or other qualified person.\"                      This\n\ndeclaration must establish that the document:\n\n            (A) was made at or near the time of the\n            occurrence of the matters set forth by, or\n            from information transmitted by, a person with\n            knowledge of those matters; (B) was kept in\n            the   course  of   the   regularly   conducted\n            activity; and (C) was made by the regularly\n            conducted activity as a regular practice.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 902(11).\n\n            The   Defendants     do   not    and    cannot   dispute       that   a\n\ndeclaration   from   Ilesh     Sanghavi,     who    worked   for   Triad    as    an\n\naccountant, touched each of these elements, providing a solid basis\n\n\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\fin the record supporting the district court's decision.14          Instead,\n\nthe Defendants take issue with the FTC's declarant's wording (use\n\nof \"believe\" and failure to use the magic words \"regular course of\n\nbusiness\"), the format of the exhibit (arguing that CDs are not\n\nproduced   in   the   regular   course    of   business),   and   their    own\n\nspeculation that the exhibit might include third party data.              None\n\nof these arguments provides any reason that we can discern to\n\noverride the district court's exercise of discretion; the only one\n\nthat might have any legal basis is the third party data argument,\n\nwhich nevertheless fails.15      Similarly, the Defendants protest the\n\nFTC's relatively late submission of the authenticating affidavit\n\nwithout actually suggesting that they have suffered any prejudice\n\n\n14\n   Specifically, the declaration identifies the documents as\nspreadsheets containing Triad's financial data and further\nprovides: (A) that from June 2000 to July 2005, the declarant\nentered Triad's financial data into spreadsheets, maintained\nTriad's accounting records, and oversaw all of Triad's employees\nwho did any accounting work; (B) that the declarant and Triad kept\nand regularly relied on these spreadsheets and the data they\ncontained; and (C) that the data were entered into the spreadsheets\nalmost daily.\n15\n   Although some circuits have extended the business records\nexception beyond its original formulation, see, e.g., United States\nv. Adefehinti, 510 F.3d 319, 326 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (explaining that\n\"a record of which a firm takes custody is . . . 'made' by the firm\nwithin the meaning of the rule . . . and thus is admissible if all\nthe other requirements are satisfied\" and listing cases to that\neffect), we need not reach that question. The records at issue\nhere were so intimately integrated into Triad and the Defendants'\nown records that they were reliable enough to be admissible without\nthe need to consider any such extension.\n\n                                   -33-\n\for otherwise indicating that their protestations would support\n\nreversal or remand.      Again, we are reminded of and apply the\n\nprinciple   that   insufficiently    developed   arguments   are   waived.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d at 17.\n\n            The Defendants also argue that they met their burden of\n\ndemonstrating the inaccuracy of the FTC's figures by arguing that\n\nDMC and Triad split only the proceeds from Coral Calcium sales, not\n\nthe gross receipts; however, they point to no hard evidence to\n\nsupport this assertion, nor do they present any counter to the\n\nargument that they could have been held liable for the whole $40.9\n\nmillion under joint and several liability.           How to weigh the\n\nevidence is a question of fact on which we must defer to the\n\ndistrict court.    And, in the end, the district court had plenty of\n\ngood reasons for its determination of damages from January 2002 to\n\nFebruary 2003, the Defendants have presented no good reasons to\n\nupset that determination,16 and we need go no further in order to\n\naffirm.\n\n\n\n\n16\n  Least of all the Defendants' argument based on their own sloppy\nrecord-keeping, which we have not yet bothered to mention: \"Thus,\nthere is no way to distinguish the amount of sales for the Coral\nCalcium product that was being sold through the Coral Calcium\ninfomercial.\" We reiterate that uncertain financial records are\nnot sufficient to demonstrate that the FTC's reasonable estimate is\ninaccurate. See Febre, 128 F.3d at 535.\n\n                                    -34-\n\fG. The district court's determination of damages from March 2003 to\nJuly 2003 was not erroneous.\n\n          The Defendants next challenge the damages award for sales\n\nof Coral Calcium from March 2003 to July 2003, at which point Triad\n\nwas out of the picture and the Defendants on appeal acted in\n\nconcert with one another exclusively.       The only argument the\n\nDefendants can muster on this front is another challenge to the\n\nauthentication of a set of business records admitted as Exhibits\n\n187 and 209.    These records are the products of DMC spreadsheets\n\nthat show $13.1 million in sales of Coral Calcium from March 2003\n\nto July 2003.   These records were authenticated by live testimony,\n\nso only Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) and not Fed. R. Evid. 902(11) applies.\n\nTo be admissible, a record must have been\n\n          made at or near the time by, or from\n          information transmitted by, a person with\n          knowledge, if kept in the course of a\n          regularly conducted business activity, and if\n          it was the regular practice of that business\n          activity to make the memorandum, report,\n          record or data compilation, all as shown by\n          the testimony of the custodian or other\n          qualified witness . . . .\n\nFed. R. Evid. 803(6).\n\n          Again, the Defendants do not and cannot dispute that an\n\naffidavit – this one from Karen Gorewitz, a DMC employee – touched\n\neach element of proper authentication, providing a solid basis in\n\n\n\n\n                                -35-\n\fthe record supporting the district court's decision.17 Instead, the\n\nDefendants generically attack Gorewitz's witness-stand testimony\n\nregarding the content of the affidavit, arguing that her lack of\n\ncertainty on peripheral issues – e.g., she did not know much about\n\nthe \"Value\" column in the spreadsheets, or whether DMC kept the\n\nrecords in any particular form – somehow undermines the documents'\n\nauthenticity.       As is frequently the case throughout their brief,\n\nthe Defendants fail to tie their general attacks into any sort of\n\nlegal theory, conducting no analysis but citing to Fed. R. Evid.\n\n803(6) and 902(11) without comment.         Even assuming that they might\n\nhave   raised   a    valid   legal   argument   (although   again   we   find\n\nourselves reminded of the rule that inadequately briefed issues are\n\nwaived, see Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17), their attack – concerning the\n\nstyle more than the substance of the witness's testimony – presents\n\nthe sort of second-guessing, cold-record inquiry that cautions\n\ndeference to the district court. See United States v. Freeman, 208\n\nF.3d 332, 339 (1st Cir. 2000).         Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n\n\n17\n   Specifically, Gorewitz testified that the records showed\ninformation entered by DMC-employed telemarketers while they were\non the phone with customers.      She further testified that she\nregularly produced reports of the sort introduced into evidence and\nrelied on the data from the databases as presented in the report\nformat. Gorewitz's firsthand observation of realtime data entry\nand regular reliance on reports in the same format and from the\nsame data as the exhibits are sufficient to meet the criteria of\nRule 803(6).\n\n                                     -36-\n\fH. The district court's determination of damages from August 2003\nto June 2004 was not erroneous.\n\n          Finally, the Defendants challenge the damages award for\n\nsales of Supreme Greens from August 2003 to June 2004.               They\n\nessentially argue that the FTC did not meet its initial burden of\n\ndemonstrating a reasonable approximation of damages.         This is so,\n\nthey argue, because the Defendants' own records were in such\n\ndisarray that the FTC could not draw a connection from the Supreme\n\nGreens receipts to the particular version of the Supreme Greens\n\ninfomercial that the FTC proved to be deceptive.             Purportedly,\n\nnumerous other versions of the Supreme Greens infomercial existed\n\nand were aired at various times and places, although no one knows\n\nwhich version was aired at what time in any given place.\n\n          The   district    court    has   discretion   to   determine   a\n\nreasonable approximation of damages, and unclear financial records\n\ncannot carry a defendant's burden of demonstrating that such a\n\nreasonable approximation is inaccurate.         See Febre, 128 F.3d at\n\n535.   Here, the Defendants could not or would not produce an\n\naccounting that suggested even a rough approximation of what\n\npercentage of their Supreme Greens proceeds were based on the\n\noffending infomercial.     Instead, in response to an interrogatory,\n\nthey represented to the FTC that their records were subject to\n\n\"substantial confusion\" and that \"it is impossible to determine\n\n\n\n                                    -37-\n\fwhat sales are attributable to any specific version of the Supreme\n\nGreens infomercial.\"     At this point, the FTC perhaps should have\n\nfiled a motion to compel, given its apparent ability to produce\n\norder from chaos in this case.         Instead, it allowed the records\n\nregarding which version of the Supreme Greens infomercial aired\n\nwhere and when to remain in disarray.      This was the one hitch in an\n\notherwise well-conducted case, but it is not enough to overcome the\n\nfact that, in the end, it is DMC's record-keeping that caused the\n\nuncertainty.   And this hitch certainly does not establish the sort\n\nof clear error required to upset the district court's careful and\n\nconsidered   ruling.     Thus,   the   district   court   was   within   its\n\ndiscretion to estimate damages broadly based on the accounting\n\ninformation available to it, and the defendants produced nothing to\n\novercome such an estimate.       See Freecom, 401 F.3d at 1206-07.       We\n\naffirm.\n\n                            III. CONCLUSION\n\n          On a well-developed record that reveals no significant\n\nfactual disputes, the district court correctly granted summary\n\njudgment to the FTC on the issue of the Defendants' liability for\n\ndeceptive advertising.    On an equally well-developed record after\n\na bench trial on damages, the district court correctly applied its\n\nequitable authority to fashion an appropriate remedy, ordering the\n\nDefendants to cure their customers in a way that their bogus\n\n                                   -38-\n\fsupplements could not.18   Accordingly, we affirm the district court\n\nin all respects.\n\n\n\n\n18\n  The Defendants argue that the district court erred in imposing\nliability against BP. They present this argument as a footnoted\nafterthought (see D. Br. 44 n.12); the FTC likewise responds to\nthis argument in a footnote (see FTC Br. 52 n.22). We continue the\ntrend and harken one more time to Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17. See\nalso Nat'l Foreign Trade Council v. Natsios, 181 F.3d 38, 60 n.17\n(1st Cir. 1999) (\"We have repeatedly held that arguments raised\nonly in a footnote or in a perfunctory manner are waived.\").\n\n                                -39-\n\f",

Having been ordered to restore these millions to the customers they deceived, the Defendants now raise a multitude of challenges to two decisions of the district court: first, the court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff Federal Trade Commission (FTC), finding the Defendants liable for deceptive advertising; and second, the court's determination of damages after a bench trial on that issue. Despite the volume of the Defendants' arguments, we find no more substance in them than the district court found in their infomercials. We therefore affirm the district court <i>in toto.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Coral Calcium infomercial.</h2>\n<p>For purposes of introduction, a fairly simple recitation of only the uncontested facts will suffice. Greater detail will follow as necessary in the discussion section.</p>\n<p>The Defendants on appeal are Direct Marketing Concepts, Inc. (DMC), ITV Direct, Inc. (ITV), Donald Barrett, Robert Maihos, and BP International (BP).<sup>[1]</sup> Barrett and Maihos co-own ITV and DMC, both Massachusetts corporations; generally, ITV produces infomercials, and DMC distributes the infomercials, answers calls, and processes orders. BP is a holding corporation to which Barrett eventually (and secretly) transferred some of DMC's assets.</p>\n<p>Beginning in late 2001, DMC, Barrett, and Maihos became involved in marketing the product Coral Calcium by producing and distributing an infomercial promoting that product. These Defendants then processed calls and sold Coral Calcium to consumers.</p>\n<p>The infomercial for Coral Calcium relied on the purported expertise of Robert <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> Barefoot. In the infomercial, Barefoot asserted a number of claims regarding coral-derived calcium<sup>[2]</sup> and its supposed biological and medical properties. Barefoot claimed that all diseases are caused by a condition called acidosis:</p>\n<blockquote>Are you getting the minerals? And if you're not, you will become acidic and you will get one of the major diseases. You can have heart disease, cancer, lupus, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis. Name the disease, they're all caused by acidosis.</blockquote>\n<p>Barefoot then claimed that calcium derived from Okinawan coral cures these diseases:</p>\n<blockquote>[W]e've been studying the coral calcium and I can tell you there are tens of millions of people, millions of testimonials. I've had 1,000 people tell me how they've cured their cancer. I've witnessed people get out of wheelchairs with multiple sclerosis just by getting on the coral.</blockquote>\n<p>Barefoot asserted that coral-derived calcium was an effective cure for these diseases because it renders the body more alkaline, thereby curing acidosis:</p>\n<blockquote>Barefoot: By the time the average American is 35, he has more calcium going out of his body and into the body and that's when it starts. By the time he's 60, 98 percent are totally calcium deficient and that's why we have people over 60 with heart disease, you know, Lupus, Parkinson's. All these diseases are caused by acidosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Trudeau (host<sup>[3]</sup>): Pain, talk about pain. Read in your book if a person has pain, muscle pain, joint pain</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Barefoot: Yes, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Trudeau: they take calcium</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Barefoot: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Trudeau: their body turns from acid to alkaline, pain goes away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Barefoot: That's exactly</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Trudeau: Is that common?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Barefoot: Yes, yes, very common.</blockquote>\n<p>Barefoot went on to claim that coral-derived calcium is superior to other sources of calcium because it is 100% bioavailable, meaning that all coral-derived calcium that is ingested is also absorbed into the body. To bolster his claims, Barefoot noted that unspecified articles from the Journal of the American Medical Association and the New England Journal of Medicine \"said that calcium supplements reverse cancer... that's a quote.\"</p>\n<p>The infomercial directed potential customers to call an 800 number, on the other end of which DMC-employed telemarketers would follow a script directing them to tell potential customers that the product Coral Calcium would be 100% absorbed by their bodies and would combat degenerative diseases by rendering an acidic body more alkaline. Telemarketers were also directed to tell sick customers that they should take higher doses of Coral Calcium, up to three times the standard dose. During the relevant time period (from January 2002 to July 2003), the Coral Calcium infomercial generated $54,034,394.82 in sales, of which approximately $575,000 were transferred to Defendant BP.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> B. The Supreme Greens infomercial.</h2>\n<p>As with Coral Calcium, the Defendants were involved collectively in the production and airing of an infomercial for the product \"Supreme Greens,\" also called \"Supreme Greens with MSM.\" ITV produced the infomercial, which Barrett hosted; DMC processed calls and orders under Maihos's direction.</p>\n<p>The infomercial for Supreme Greens relied on the purported expertise of \"Dr.\" Alejandro Guerrero.<sup>[4]</sup> Like Barefoot, Guerrero claimed that many major diseases are caused by acidosis, and that these diseases can be prevented and cured by rendering the body more alkaline:</p>\n<blockquote>Barrett: Dr. Guerrero claims that most chronic degenerative diseasessuch as cancer, arthritis, diabetes, even the number one killer out there, heart disease can and are being cured....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Guerrero: So if we can change the body's fluids and tissues to a more alkaline base, now you have an environment that is no longer conducive for the proliferation or growth of a degenerative condition....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Barrett: ... If I alkalize my body, am I going to come up with one of these chronic degenerative diseases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Guerrero: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Barrett: Such as cancer, arthritis</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Guerrero: No.... I'm very confident in saying that, primarily because of the clinical studies we've done. I've seen it in myin myclinical practice. I've seen it every day in my clinical practice.</blockquote>\n<p>Going beyond even Barefoot, Guerrero also claimed that Supreme Greens can cause weight loss by restoring alkalinity because \"fat is your body's way of protecting itself from the acidic fluids.\"</p>\n<p>The infomercial directed potential customers to call an 800 number, on the other end of which DMC-employed telemarketers would follow a script directing them to ask potential customers about their health issues and then explain how Supreme Greens supposedly could address those issues. For example, if a customer said she had cancer, the telemarketer was supposed to respond that \"cancer is acidosis of the body and Supreme Greens alkalizes the body, and that's what you need, so you really want to take this.\" During the relevant time period (August 2003 to June 2004), Supreme Greens generated $14,683,436.24 in sales.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The FTC action.</h2>\n<p>In June 2004, the FTC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against a number of parties,<sup>[5]</sup> alleging violations of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 45 and 52. The FTC sought both injunctive relief and monetary equitable relief in order to redress customers who had purchased Coral Calcium or Supreme Greens in reliance on the Defendants' allegedly deceptive infomercials. In July 2008, the district court granted summary judgment against the Defendants on the issue of liability, holding that the challenged infomercials were misleading as a matter of law. In August 2009, after a bench trial, the district court entered two Final Orders and Judgments permanently enjoining the Defendants from running their deceptive infomercials and ordering disgorgement from the Defendants (excluding BP) in the amount of $48,220,499.12 and from BP in the amount <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> of $574,274.23. The Defendants now appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>The Defendants take a shotgun approach to their appeal, asserting that: (1) the district court applied an incorrect standard in finding them liable for deceptive advertising; (2) the record contained issues of fact as to whether they possessed sufficient substantiation for the claims asserted in the infomercials; (3) the claims made in the infomercials were mere puffery and were mollified by disclaimers, and therefore were not actionable; (4) Maihos is not individually liable as a matter of law; (5) the district court erred in calculating damages on the basis of the Defendants' gross receipts rather than net profits; (6) the district court erred in determining damages from January 2002 to February 2003; (7) the district court erred in determining damages from March 2003 to July 2003; and (8) the district court erred in determining damages from August 2003 to June 2004.</p>\n<p>The FTC seeks to uphold the judgment of the district court in all respects, asserting that: (1) the district court applied a correct standard in finding the Defendants liable for deceptive advertising; (2) the record contained vast swaths of uncontradicted evidence supporting the Defendants' lack of adequate substantiation for the claims asserted in the infomercials; (3) the claims in the infomercials were specific and definite and therefore not exempted from liability under the puffery or disclaimer rules; (4) as half-owner and officer of DMC, Maihos is individually liable; (5) the district court has broad discretion to fashion an equitable remedy, and exercised the discretion appropriately and in accordance with precedent; (6) the district court did not err in determining damages from January 2002 to February 2003; (7) the district court did not err in determining damages from March 2003 to July 2003; and (8) the district court did not err in determining damages from August 2003 to June 2004.</p>\n<p>This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review <i>de novo</i> both the district court's decision to grant a summary judgment motion, <i>see </i><i>Zimmerman v. Puccio,</i> 613 F.3d 60, 70 (1st Cir.2010), and the district court's legal determinations after a bench trial, overturning the district court's factual determinations after a bench trial only in the case of clear error, <i>see </i><i>Wojciechowicz v. United States,</i> 582 F.3d 57, 66 (1st Cir.2009). Applying these familiar standards to the Defendants' arguments as appropriate, we see no need to diverge from the district court on any point.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The \"reasonable basis\" test is appropriate for deceptive advertising claims.</h2>\n<p>The Defendants challenge both the legal and factual bases for the district court's grant of summary judgment. We begin by teasing out the applicable law.</p>\n<p>Our starting point is the FTC statute, which provides that both \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce\" (15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1)) and \"disseminat[ing], or caus[ing] to be disseminated, any false advertisement ... in or having an effect upon commerce\" (15 U.S.C. § 52(a)) are \"unlawful.\" 15 U.S.C. § 55 defines the term \"false advertisement\" as \"an advertisement, other than labeling, which is misleading in a material respect....\" Given the strong similarity between the terms \"deceptive\" and \"misleading\", it is no surprise that sections 45 and 52 are sometimes applied in tandem as the basis for an FTC action against an alleged false advertiser; indeed, such a tandem <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> reading is expressly allowed by 15 U.S.C. § 52(b).</p>\n<p>When the FTC brings an action based on the theory that advertising is deceptive because the advertisers lacked a reasonable basis for their claims, the FTC must: (1) demonstrate \"what evidence would in fact establish such a claim in the relevant scientific community\"; and (2) \"compare[] the advertisers' substantiation evidence to that required by the scientific community to see if the claims have been established.\" <i>Removatron Intern. Corp. v. FTC,</i> 884 F.2d 1489, 1498 (1st Cir.1989) (applying to administrative determination of deceptive advertising); <i>see also </i><i>FTC v. Garvey,</i> 383 F.3d 891, 901 (9th Cir.2004) (applying the same test to claims by FTC in court). Where the advertisers lack adequate substantiation evidence, they necessarily lack any reasonable basis for their claims. <i>See </i><i>Removatron,</i> 884 F.2d at 1498. And where the advertisers so lack a reasonable basis, their ads are deceptive as a matter of law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Defendants argue that there is a third prong to a deceptive advertising claim, asserting that the FTC was required and failedto prove that the infomercials were actually false. However, that argument is at odds with the cases cited above. Indeed, the Defendants cannot point to any source adequate to disrupt the FTC's and district court's firm grounding in case law.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Instead, the Defendants cite haphazardly to a federal statute (the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-417, 108 Stat. 4325), whose legal relevance (if any) the Defendants never explain, and to a smattering of First Amendment case law, without engaging in any application of those sources or attempting to produce so much as a rough sketch of a rule that might support their proposition. We can make neither heads nor tails of these citations, which have no clear relevance and which are completely devoid of context or developed argument. We therefore hold that the Defendants have waived any argument they might have raised under those sources, if any exists. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").</p>\n<p>In light of the Defendants' failure to raise any principled objection to the \"reasonable basis\" framework, which was carefully applied by the district court, the remainder of our analysis will follow that framework.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Defendants produced no actual substantiation for their health claims.</h2>\n<p>We must now consider the application of the <i>Removatron</i> \"reasonable basis\" test to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> the record on summary judgment. To recap, under this test (and applying the summary judgment standard), we must determine whether there was uncontroverted evidence regarding: (1) what sort of evidence would scientifically establish the claims the Defendants made in their infomercials; and (2) whether the Defendants were actually possessed of such evidence. <i>See </i><i>Removatron,</i> 884 F.2d at 1498. It is uncontested that the Defendants asserted the following claims in their infomercials: (1) coral-derived calcium supplements cure cancer, multiple sclerosis, and other degenerative diseases by rendering acidic bodies more alkaline, and they are 100% absorbed by the human body; and (2) Supreme Greens cure cancer and cause weight loss by rendering acidic bodies more alkaline. If these claims are not supported by sufficient scientific evidence, then liability follows. The Defendants claim that there are issues of fact on both prongs as applied to both infomercials.</p>\n<p>On the first prong, the FTC produced four expert declarations which demonstrated that the claims could be substantiated by double-blind, placebo-controlled human studies. Specifically, Dr. Richard Wood averred that \"[i]t is generally accepted that human studies are required to support a scientific finding concerning the bioavailability of a test compound in the human body.\" Dr. Maryfran Sowers provided specific examples of the scientific standards for, e.g., a chemical compound's effect on heart health: \"It is generally accepted among scientists that for a test compound or product to be considered as having a clinically meaningful effect on blood pressure, the changes in blood pressure caused by the compound or test must reach certain established thresholds,\" which she then described in numerical detail. Dr. Sowers outlined other contours of reliability, noting that prospective studies of 50,000 and 90,000 subjects were \"considered very reliable because of the large cohort involved and the breadth of information collected,\" whereas \"the early data collected in a longitudinal study is scientifically suspect until adequate temporal distance is established between when the calcium intake data was collected and the time when new or incident blood pressure could develop.\" Dr. Landon King averred that \"[i]n order to evaluate whether an intervention compound ... changed the pH balance of the body, researchers would develop a protocol for a controlled clinical trial that would measure the subjects' pH balance prior to receiving the test compound (or placebo) and at an appropriate period(s) after receiving either the test compound or a placebo.\" Dr. King noted specifically that \"[i]n order to claim that a product increases alkalinity, reasonable scientists would expect the product to have been subject to such an appropriate clinical study.\" Dr. Barrie Cassileth averred that \"[t]he most scientifically valid way to determine whether Supreme Greens (or any other product) produces any results is a double-blind, placebo controlled study.\"</p>\n<p>To be sure, there may be other scientific evidence that could be sufficient, and we may assume for these purposes that a double-blind study is not necessarily required. But the government established that some scientific evidence is required for substantiation, and thus satisfied the first prong of the <i>Removatron</i> test. Because the FTC produced affidavits which are more than adequate on their face to satisfy the first prong of a \"reasonable basis\" claim, and because the Defendants neither produced nor pointed to any evidence to raise even the tiniest of fact issues, summary judgment was appropriate on the first prong.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> On the second prong, the FTC relied on the same four expert declarations, in which the experts compared the Defendants' evidence to the available literature and concluded in each case that the Defendants' evidence was woefully inadequate. The experts specifically opined that: (1) there was some evidence that calcium might help to prevent colorectal cancer but no evidence that calcium cures cancer; (2) there was some evidence that calcium might lower blood pressure but none that it cures heart disease; (3) there was no evidence whatsoever that calcium has any effect on autoimmune disorders; (4) there has been no research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association or the New England Journal of Medicine indicating that calcium \"reverses\" cancer; (5) there is no evidence that any kind of calcium is 100% absorbed; (6) there is no evidence that any disease is caused by \"an overly acidic body\"; (7) there is no evidence that alkalinity cures cancer or heart disease; (8) there is no evidence that any ingredient of Supreme Greens can prevent, treat, or cure cancer, heart disease, or diabetes; and (9) there is no evidence that Supreme Greens may cause weight loss.</p>\n<p>The record contains a slew of other documents, including excerpts from Barefoot's books, excerpts from Barefoot's deposition testimony, excerpts from Guerrero's deposition testimony, a number of popular science and pseudoscientific articles, and one preliminary study. The Defendants claim that this evidence provided them with a reasonable basis for accepting the infomercials' claims as true. However, it is clear that none of this material comes close to establishing an issue of fact regarding the Defendants' woefully inadequate substantiation evidence.</p>\n<p>Barefoot's books present jumbles of quotes from scientists, scientific review articles, and scientific studies interspersed with references to Reader's Digest and other general-consumption reductions of these studies. His sources support such uncontroversial propositions as \"[t]he connection between the electrical activity of the cell and the release of the neurotransmitter is not direct; <i>an essential intermediary is the calcium ion.</i>\" Robert R. Barefoot &amp; Carl J. Reich, <i>The Calcium Factor</i> (2000) (internal citation removed) (emphasis Barefoot's). However, none of these scientists or studies supports the panacean claims made in the Coral Calcium infomercial; the claims are extrapolations, distortions, and sometimes, seemingly, utter fabrications. It appears to be no accident that neither Barefoot, nor any Defendant, nor any of the Defendants' attorneys has at any point in these proceedings identified any particular scientific study or studies to support the specific claims presented in the Coral Calcium infomercial. Indeed, Barefoot's deposition testimony primarily relies on appeals to generic authority; his standard rhetorical practice is to assert that there are myriad studies that support a given claim, without identifying any specifically.<sup>[7]</sup> When pressed for specificity, he generally refers the questioner to his books.<sup>[8]</sup> Nowhere in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> the record is there any support for, e.g., the following propositions: all diseases are caused by acidosis; calcium supplements cure cancer; calcium supplements cure multiple sclerosis; or coral-derived calcium is 100% absorbed into the body.</p>\n<p>Guerrero's testimony is even less compelling, given that he relies primarily on his own general experience as an alternative medicine practitioner, without reference to any studies at all. The Defendants make much of a double-blind, controlled, but also unpublished and preliminary study, which they assert supports the health claims advanced in the Supreme Greens infomercial; however, the study found, based on a sample size of sixteen people, that one of the ingredients in Supreme GreensMethyl-Sulfonyl-Methane, or MSMmight relieve arthritis pain and was therefore worthy of further study. This study on its face is grossly insufficient to support the Defendants' claims of Supreme Greens' efficacy in treating all diseases. And even the abstracts and excerpts from pseudoscientific articles, published in journals such as the non-peer reviewed and now-defunct Healthy &amp; Natural Journal and Natural Way for Better Health, do not support the specific claims made in either infomerciale.g., there is no support for the claims that the product Supreme Greens or any of their ingredients cure cancer, cure heart disease, or cause weight loss by alkalizing the body and thereby curing its need for fat as a protection against acid.</p>\n<p>Given the complete absence of support for the vast majority of the Defendants' health claimswhich absence the FTC's four experts also testified to on the basis of their own literature reviewswe easily could conclude that the Defendants lacked adequate substantiation under even the most lax standard of scientific reliability. Here, however, the FTC produced evidence establishing a rigorous standard of scientific reliability, and the record reveals that the Defendants fell well and unquestionably short of this standard. In all, the strong evidence establishing a scientific standard for evaluating the Defendants' advertising claims, the overwhelming evidence supporting the Defendants' lack of substantiation evidence, and the failure of the Defendants to indicate any evidence to raise an issue of fact on either point, compel the legal conclusion that the Defendants lacked a reasonable basis for the health claims they used to sell their products. <i>Cf. </i><i>Removatron,</i> 884 F.2d at 1498. The Defendants therefore engaged in deceptive advertising as a matter of law. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The Defendants made specific health claims which were not cured by general disclaimers.</h2>\n<p>The Defendants attempt to head off the above analysis by asserting that their infomercials advanced no actual health claims but, instead, presented only puffery which was further attenuated by the presence of general disclaimers. Where a claim is merely \"exaggerated advertising, blustering, and boasting upon which no reasonable buyer would rely,\" it may be un-actionable puffery. <i>See </i><i>Clorox Co. Puerto Rico v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Comm. Co.,</i> 228 F.3d 24, 38 (1st Cir.2000) (quotation marks omitted). However, \"specific and measurable\" claims and claims that may be literally true or false are not puffery, and may be the subject of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> deceptive advertising claims. <i>Id.</i> (quotation marks omitted). As set forth above, <i>passim,</i> the Defendants' infomercials presented specific and measurable health claims. These claims included definite statements that coral calcium cures cancer, autoimmune diseases, and pain by rendering acidic bodies more alkaline, as well as statements that Supreme Greens cure cancer, heart disease, and cause weight loss by rendering acidic bodies more alkaline. Due to their specificity and concreteness, such claims go far beyond puffery as a matter of law. <i>See id.</i> at 39.</p>\n<p>The presence of disclaimers does not provide any more assistance to the Defendants. This court has held that \"[d]isclaimers or qualifications in any particular ad are not adequate to avoid liability unless they are sufficiently prominent and unambiguous to change the apparent meaning of the claims and to leave an accurate impression. Anything less is only likely to cause confusion by creating contradictory double meanings.\" <i>Removatron,</i> 884 F.2d at 1497. The disclaimers at issue here did nothing to affect the meaning of the infomercials' health claims and were not even sufficient to cause confusion, given the clarity and concreteness of the claims. The infomercial transcripts reveal only disclaimers that the infomercials are paid advertising. The Defendants have presented no concrete evidence of any other attenuating messages.<sup>[9]</sup> In contrast, the health claims were bold and straightforward, presented by supposed experts as testable observations backed up by clinical trials and studies. Given the Defendants' lack of substantiation for these concrete claims framed by do-nothing disclaimers, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on the issue of the Defendants' liability for deceptive advertising.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Maihos is individually liable as an owner and corporate officer who lacked appropriate substantiation.</h2>\n<p>The Defendants present one last argument on liability, arguing that the district court erred in holding Maihos individually liable. Individual liability for deceptive advertising is appropriate where an individual (1) was a corporate officer with the capacity to make decisions regarding the challenged conduct, and (2) knew or should have known that there was no reasonable basis for the deceptive claims. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>FTC v. Publishing Clearing House, Inc.,</i> 104 F.3d 1168, 1170 (9th Cir. 1997). The FTC produced ample support for each proposition, and the Defendants produced no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p>The FTC produced evidence that Maihos was a 50% owner of DMC and ITV, that he controlled both companies' purse strings and day-to-day operations, and that he was the contact for an attorney <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> retained to review the infomercials for their legality under federal trade law.<sup>[10]</sup> Maihos (ignoring his status as an officer and half-owner of DMC) focuses on gaps in his responsibilities, relying on, e.g., his testimony that he did not edit the content of advertising. This is simply irrelevant. The question is whether he could have nipped the offending infomercials in the bud; the FTC produced evidence that he could, and he has produced no evidence even his own testimonyto indicate that he couldn't. <i>See </i><i>FTC v. Freecom Comm., Inc.,</i> 401 F.3d 1192, 1205 (10th Cir.2005) (finding individual liability where \"[e]verybody knew that [the defendant] was the principal shareholder of the company and his opinions and advice and direction were listened to very carefully and were generally followed or heeded\").</p>\n<p>On the second prong, Maihos's knowledge, the FTC produced Maihos's own deposition testimony admitting that DMC did not have any substantiation for the claims made in either infomercial. Maihos also testified about an email he received from his then-girlfriend, a registered dietitian. The email provides both direct and circumstantial evidence of Maihos's knowledge. The email is direct evidence that the girlfriend informed Maihos that \"[c]alcium from anything cannot be 100 percent bioavailable\" and that \"[t]here's no evidence at all that Coral Calcium is better than ordinary calcium or has any special health-boosting properties.\" The girlfriend also asked Maihos, \"do you think there is a product ([over the counter] no less) that can prevent heart disease, diabetes, arthritis AND cancer?\" Maihos testified that he dismissed the email as mere skepticism. However, the email is also circumstantial evidence that Maihos actually requested the information from the girlfriend, who consulted third parties on Maihos's behalf. The email begins, \"Hello, as requested here are the responses I got.\" It also attached an email from the address Wic-talk@NAL. USDA.GOV, which a quick internet search reveals is an electronic discussion group promoted by the United States Department of Agriculture \"for use by individuals involved in providing nutrition services.\" <i>See</i> WIC-Talk, http://www.nal.usda.gov/ wicworks/Talk/index.html (last visited Oct. 19, 2010). Thus, the imputed exchange giving rise to the girlfriend's email implies that Maihos himself questioned the infomercials' claims. The FTC also produced evidence that Maihos had attended DMC meetings regarding the production of \"clean\" and \"re-edited\" versions of the infomercials while earlier versions of the infomercials still ran. Finally, the FTC produced evidence that an attorney suggested to Maihos in October 2003, well before the Defendants pulled the Supreme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> Greens infomercial off the air,<sup>[11]</sup> that the Supreme Greens infomercial required voluminous support and advanced \"BS\" claims.</p>\n<p>Again, the Defendants point to nothing that might challenge any of this evidence, relying instead on Maihos's protestations that he sincerely believed in the infomercials' health claims. It is true that two district court cases support the proposition that sincere belief may be an element in the individual liability calculus; however, even sincere belief is not sufficient here to overcome the overwhelming evidence that Maihos knew or, at the very least, should have known that the infomercials lacked any reasonable basis in scientific fact. <i>See </i><i>FTC v. Medical Billers Network, Inc.,</i> 543 F.Supp.2d 283, 320-22 (S.D.N.Y.2008) (finding individual liability); <i>FTC v. Patriot Alcohol Testers, Inc.,</i> 798 F.Supp. 851, 860 n. 3 (D.Mass.1992). This is particularly so given that the patent ridiculousness of the infomercials' health claims was presented multiple times by multiple people to Maihos, who chose to remain willfully blind. Thus, there is no question that Maihos knew that the infomercials' claims lacked substantiation, that he had the authority to control DMC and ITV, and, nevertheless, that he did little or nothing. The district court did not err in holding Maihos individually liable for deceptive advertising, and we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Gross receipts are an appropriate basis for calculating damages.</h2>\n<p>Turning now to the issue of damages, the Defendants begin by arguing that damages for deceptive advertising are limited to actual profits, not gross receipts. If this were so, then at least part of the district court's damages award would be erroneous. However, the law allows for broad discretion in fashioning a remedy for deceptive advertising; many cases uphold rescission (effectively, restoring the parties to pre-sale status) or restitution (under these facts, the same) as appropriate remedies. <i>See </i><i>Trudeau,</i> 579 F.3d at 771 (noting that \"[c]onsumer loss is a common measure for civil sanctions in contempt proceedings and direct FTC actions\" and listing cases). Thus, consumer loss, as represented by the Defendants' gross receipts, would appear to be an appropriate measure of damages.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Defendants ask us to rely on <i>FTC v. Verity Int'l, Ltd.,</i> 443 F.3d 48 (2d Cir.2006), for the proposition that the FTC's remedy is limited to the Defendants' profits rather than their gross receipts. <i>Verity</i>'s limited rule does not apply here.</p>\n<p>In <i>Verity,</i> a series of unrelated, non-party middlemen partook of the proceeds from the defendants' scheme before the defendants themselves got a bite. <i>See</i> 443 F.3d at 53 (describing the relationship as a \"multitiered, cascading-payment structure\"). The court found this payment structure highly relevant to the issue of damages, noting that \"in many cases in which the FTC seeks restitution, the defendant's gain will be equal to the consumer's loss\" but casting <i>Verity</i>'s facts as an exception limited to the situation \"when some middleman <i>not party to the lawsuit</i> takes some of the consumer's money before it reaches a defendant's hands.\" <i>Id.</i> at 68 (emphasis added); <i>see also </i><i>Trudeau,</i> 579 F.3d at 772 (describing <i>Verity</i> as holding only that \"certain circumstances require courts to limit disgorgement to the defendant's profits\"). Here, the Defendants <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> seek to inflate <i>Verity</i>'s exception so that it overshadows the rule.</p>\n<p>We are not persuaded. Because this set of facts lacks the non-party middleman that gave rise to the exception in <i>Verity,</i> we will follow the general rule. Here, the Defendants on appeal took in proceeds directly, except for roughly one year when fellow defendant (but non-appellant) Triad processed Coral Calcium orders. The FTC introduced ample evidence of the overall proceeds from Coral Calcium during this period; however, the parties' financial records were in such disarray that the actual split among the parties could not be determined.<sup>[12]</sup> The Defendants on appeal now claim that Triad siphoned off the vast majority of the proceeds, leaving them holding an empty bag, but we cannot tell whether this is the case. Because every entity that had received consumer money was a defendant, the district court held that gross receipts were an appropriate measure of damages; because records were unclear as to how much consumer money each defendant received, the district court evenly split the total receipts between DMC and Triad for the time period when Triad acted as a middleman. This was consistent with <i>Verity</i> and within the bounds of the district court's discretion in fashioning an equitable remedy. <i>See </i><i>Freecom,</i> 401 F.3d at 1202 n. 6 (noting that the FTC Act's \"grant of authority to provide injunctive relief carries with it the full range of equitable remedies, including the power to grant consumer redress\").</p>\n<p>Thus, the district court committed no error in resting its damages determination on the Defendants' gross receipts rather than their net profits, and we will proceed to review the court's calculation of what those gross receipts actually were. To determine the appropriate amount of damages in deceptive advertising cases, courts apply a burden-shifting scheme. First, the FTC must provide the court with a reasonable approximation of damages.<sup>[13]</sup><i>See </i><i>FTC v. Febre,</i> 128 F.3d 530, 535 (7th Cir.1997). Both gross receipts and net customer loss are appropriate measures. <i>See id.</i>; <i>Freecom,</i> 401 F.3d at 1206. Once a reasonable approximation of damages has been provided, the defendant has an opportunity to demonstrate that the figures are inaccurate. <i>See </i><i>Febre,</i> 128 F.3d at 535. Any fuzzy figures due to a defendant's uncertain bookkeeping cannot carry a defendant's burden to show inaccuracy. <i>See id.</i> The district court and all parties find a rare point of agreement in the notion that this exercise may be broken down into three constituent time periodsJanuary 2002 to February 2003, March 2003 to July 2003, and August 2003 to June 2004each of which we will address in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. The district court's determination of damages from January 2002 to February 2003 was not erroneous.</h2>\n<p>The Defendants first challenge the propriety of the damages award for sales of Coral Calcium from January 2002 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> to February 2003, during which time DMC and fellow defendant (but non-appellant) Triad cooperated to sell Coral Calcium. The FTC introduced Exhibit 185 to support a finding that these defendants collectively received $40.9 million from sales of Coral Calcium from January 2002 to February 2003. A witnessSteven Ritchey, Triad's vice president in charge of accounting testified that gross receipts from this time period were $40.9 million. Even Defendant Barrett testified that gross receipts from this time period were around $40 million. The district court credited all of the above, found that gross receipts were $40.9 million, found that the records were unclear on the exact division of proceeds between DMC and Triad, and therefore judiciously split the award in two. This was all well within the court's discretion, and the Defendants do not raise any serious argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p>The Defendants do challenge Exhibit 185 as improperly admitted. Although there is adequate evidence to support the district court's determination even absent Exhibit 185, we will briefly explain why that exhibit's admission was appropriate. Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) provides that business records may be admissible if certified according to Fed.R.Evid. 902(11). Rule 902(11) provides that \"a duplicate of a domestic record of regularly conducted activity\" is admissible \"if accompanied by a written declaration of its custodian or other qualified person.\" This declaration must establish that the document:</p>\n<blockquote>(A) was made at or near the time of the occurrence of the matters set forth by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge of those matters; (B) was kept in the course of the regularly conducted activity; and (C) was made by the regularly conducted activity as a regular practice.</blockquote>\n<p>Fed.R.Evid. 902(11).</p>\n<p>The Defendants do not and cannot dispute that a declaration from Ilesh Sanghavi, who worked for Triad as an accountant, touched each of these elements, providing a solid basis in the record supporting the district court's decision.<sup>[14]</sup> Instead, the Defendants take issue with the FTC's declarant's wording (use of \"believe\" and failure to use the magic words \"regular course of business\"), the format of the exhibit (arguing that CDs are not produced in the regular course of business), and their own speculation that the exhibit might include third party data. None of these arguments provides any reason that we can discern to override the district court's exercise of discretion; the only one that might have any legal basis is the third party data argument, which nevertheless fails.<sup>[15]</sup> Similarly, the Defendants protest the FTC's relatively late submission of the authenticating affidavit without actually <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> suggesting that they have suffered any prejudice or otherwise indicating that their protestations would support reversal or remand. Again, we are reminded of and apply the principle that insufficiently developed arguments are waived. <i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17.</p>\n<p>The Defendants also argue that they met their burden of demonstrating the inaccuracy of the FTC's figures by arguing that DMC and Triad split only the proceeds from Coral Calcium sales, not the gross receipts; however, they point to no hard evidence to support this assertion, nor do they present any counter to the argument that they could have been held liable for the whole $40.9 million under joint and several liability. How to weigh the evidence is a question of fact on which we must defer to the district court. And, in the end, the district court had plenty of good reasons for its determination of damages from January 2002 to February 2003, the Defendants have presented no good reasons to upset that determination,<sup>[16]</sup> and we need go no further in order to affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>G. The district court's determination of damages from March 2003 to July 2003 was not erroneous.</h2>\n<p>The Defendants next challenge the damages award for sales of Coral Calcium from March 2003 to July 2003, at which point Triad was out of the picture and the Defendants on appeal acted in concert with one another exclusively. The only argument the Defendants can muster on this front is another challenge to the authentication of a set of business records admitted as Exhibits 187 and 209. These records are the products of DMC spreadsheets that show $13.1 million in sales of Coral Calcium from March 2003 to July 2003. These records were authenticated by live testimony, so only Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) and not Fed.R.Evid. 902(11) applies. To be admissible, a record must have been</p>\n<blockquote>made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record or data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness....</blockquote>\n<p>Fed.R.Evid. 803(6).</p>\n<p>Again, the Defendants do not and cannot dispute that an affidavitthis one from Karen Gorewitz, a DMC employee touched each element of proper authentication, providing a solid basis in the record supporting the district court's decision.<sup>[17]</sup> Instead, the Defendants generically attack Gorewitz's witness-stand testimony regarding the content of the affidavit, arguing that her lack of certainty on peripheral issuese.g., she did not know much about the \"Value\" column in the spreadsheets, or whether DMC kept the records in any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> particular formsomehow undermines the documents' authenticity. As is frequently the case throughout their brief, the Defendants fail to tie their general attacks into any sort of legal theory, conducting no analysis but citing to Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) and 902(11) without comment. Even assuming that they might have raised a valid legal argument (although again we find ourselves reminded of the rule that inadequately briefed issues are waived, <i>see </i><i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17), their attackconcerning the style more than the substance of the witness's testimonypresents the sort of second-guessing, cold-record inquiry that cautions deference to the district court. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Freeman,</i> 208 F.3d 332, 339 (1st Cir.2000). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>H. The district court's determination of damages from August 2003 to June 2004 was not erroneous.</h2>\n<p>Finally, the Defendants challenge the damages award for sales of Supreme Greens from August 2003 to June 2004. They essentially argue that the FTC did not meet its initial burden of demonstrating a reasonable approximation of damages. This is so, they argue, because the Defendants' own records were in such disarray that the FTC could not draw a connection from the Supreme Greens receipts to the particular version of the Supreme Greens infomercial that the FTC proved to be deceptive. Purportedly, numerous other versions of the Supreme Greens infomercial existed and were aired at various times and places, although no one knows which version was aired at what time in any given place.</p>\n<p>The district court has discretion to determine a reasonable approximation of damages, and unclear financial records cannot carry a defendant's burden of demonstrating that such a reasonable approximation is inaccurate. <i>See </i><i>Febre,</i> 128 F.3d at 535. Here, the Defendants could not or would not produce an accounting that suggested even a rough approximation of what percentage of their Supreme Greens proceeds were based on the offending infomercial. Instead, in response to an interrogatory, they represented to the FTC that their records were subject to \"substantial confusion\" and that \"it is impossible to determine what sales are attributable to any specific version of the Supreme Greens infomercial.\" At this point, the FTC perhaps should have filed a motion to compel, given its apparent ability to produce order from chaos in this case. Instead, it allowed the records regarding which version of the Supreme Greens infomercial aired where and when to remain in disarray. This was the one hitch in an otherwise well-conducted case, but it is not enough to overcome the fact that, in the end, it is DMC's record-keeping that caused the uncertainty. And this hitch certainly does not establish the sort of clear error required to upset the district court's careful and considered ruling. Thus, the district court was within its discretion to estimate damages broadly based on the accounting information available to it, and the defendants produced nothing to overcome such an estimate. <i>See </i><i>Freecom,</i> 401 F.3d at 1206-07. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>On a well-developed record that reveals no significant factual disputes, the district court correctly granted summary judgment to the FTC on the issue of the Defendants' liability for deceptive advertising. On an equally well-developed record after a bench trial on damages, the district court correctly applied its equitable authority to fashion an appropriate remedy, ordering the Defendants to cure their customers in a way that their bogus supplements <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> could not.<sup>[18]</sup> Accordingly, we <i>affirm</i> the district court in all respects.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  We capitalize the word Defendant to refer to the Defendants on appeal, using lowercase when non-appellants are included, and providing clarification as appropriate.</p>\n<p>[2]  The name of the product was not featured in the infomercial, which only referred generally to the purported healing properties of calcium derived from coral skeletons harvested off the coast of Okinawa, Japan.</p>\n<p>[3]  Host Kevin Trudeau's issues with the FTC present a whole other story, set forth in <i>FTC v. Trudeau,</i> 579 F.3d 754, 757-62 (7th Cir. 2009) (including a brief discussion of Trudeau's involvement with the Coral Calcium infomercial).</p>\n<p>[4]  The infomercial presented Guerrero as a \"Doctor of Oriental Medicine,\" but Guerrero did not have any such degree.</p>\n<p>[5]  Including, among others, the Defendants on appeal as listed above, as well as Triad ML Marketing, Inc. (Triad), a corporation which will become relevant later.</p>\n<p>[6]  The Defendants do cite to a footnote in <i>FTC v. Enforma Natural Products, Inc.,</i> 362 F.3d 1204 (9th Cir.2004), for the proposition that the FTC must prove actual falsity. <i>Id.</i> at 1217 n. 14. However, the Ninth Circuit's footnoted aside is grounded in the earlier case <i>FTC v. Pantron I Corp.,</i> 33 F.3d 1088 (9th Cir.1994), in which the court recognized that the FTC had abandoned a reasonable basis claim and was expressly proceeding on a theory of actual falsity. <i>See</i> 33 F.3d at 1096 (\"discuss[ing] only the falsity theory\" because \"the F.T.C. clearly and expressly abandoned the reasonable basis theory\"). Thus, <i>Pantron</i> recognized the distinction between a reasonable basis approachthe approach the FTC favors hereand a falsity approach. <i>See id.</i> And, contra the bald assertion in <i>Enforma,</i> the <i>Pantron</i> court stated plainly that \"a false advertisement need not even be false; it need only be misleading in a material respect.\" 33 F.3d at 1099 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the statement in <i>Enforma</i> on which the Defendants rely is not only dicta, but also incorrect.</p>\n<p>[7]  For example, Barefoot claims that he \"hired the No. 1 scientist in America ... and he did a peer-review study all over the world and came up with thousands and thousands of references\"; and that \"I could load you up where it would take you ten years to get out of this building before you read all the people that say calcium prevents cancer\"; and that \"[t]ens of thousands of scientists are saying that [calcium prevents cancer], and I can show you the documents.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  For example, when asked about the public availability of these uncountable studies, Barefoot said \"I have just finished a book called Let's Cure Humanity, in which I give you 1,000 scientific references. You're asking for them. I'm giving them to you. I will also give you 100 scientific quotations from the world's best scientists, and the quotations are startling: reverses PMS, it reverses cancer; that it reverses diabetes....\"</p>\n<p>[9]  The Defendants' brief claims that the infomercials contained \"disclaimers that stated the shows ... expressed the opinions of the speakers, and that the products were not intended to diagnose, treat or cure any disease.\" The brief contains no record cites, and the only relevant evidence below (not included in the appendix but pointed out at oral argument) is an affidavit from Luke Goljian, who testified that one version of the Supreme Greens infomercialthe ninth edit, which was \"sent out on several occasions to stations\" during an indeterminate time framedid include disclaimers fitting the description in the brief. But even assuming that these disclaimers actually accompanied either of the challenged infomercialsdespite the absence of any concrete support for that proposition in the recordsuch disclaimers would not leave an accurate impression but instead would only cause confusion. <i>Cf. </i><i>Removatron,</i> 884 F.2d at 1497. A statement that studies prove a product cures a certain disease, followed by a disclaimer that the statement is opinion and the product actually does not cure the disease, leaves an overall impression of nonsense, not clarity.</p>\n<p>[10]  Maihos also seeks to rely on two district court cases, both of which found straw officers and owners not individually liable. <i>See </i><i>FTC v. QT, Inc.,</i> 448 F.Supp.2d 908, 973 (N.D.Ill.2006) (corporate officer who \"had no involvement in the actions that led to corporate liability\" and \"has no set position and provides help around the office\" not liable); <i>United States v. Building Inspector of America, Inc.,</i> 894 F.Supp. 507, 519-20 (D.Mass. 1995) (finding liability where \"founder and president['s]\" claim of no involvement was \"entirely implausible\"; finding issue of fact as to liability for vice president with no evidence of actual authority or direct involvement; and finding no liability for treasurer with no evidence of any authority or any involvement). <i>Building Inspector</i> recognizes individual liability for a \"founder and president.\" <i>See</i> 894 F.Supp. at 519. In addition to being a founder, Maihos was the founding president of DMC. Maihos's extensive duties, involvement, and ownership interest in the corporate Defendants bring him entirely outside the ambit of these non-controlling cases to the extent they find no liability for corporate officers. <i>Cf. id.</i></p>\n<p>[11]  For example, there is evidence in the record that Donald Barrett sent an email to \"All Managers\" on February 23, 2004, stating that \"[w]e should now be using the original version Supreme Greens\" and that a new version would \"be testing in April or the beginning of next qtr.\"</p>\n<p>[12]  The FTC perhaps ought to have made more of an effort to nail down the details of the parties' finances during discovery, as we also note <i>infra</i> at 18, but there is no question that the primary fault lies with the Defendants.</p>\n<p>[13]  The Defendants argue that the district court did not hold the FTC to its initial burden of proving a reasonable approximation of damages, and therefore that the court engaged in premature burden shifting by relying on the Defendants' disheveled records as proffered by the FTC. This argument has no merit, as we uphold in each instance the evidentiary basis for the damages award and find that the FTC presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a reasonable approximation of damages.</p>\n<p>[14]  Specifically, the declaration identifies the documents as spreadsheets containing Triad's financial data and further provides: (A) that from June 2000 to July 2005, the declarant entered Triad's financial data into spreadsheets, maintained Triad's accounting records, and oversaw all of Triad's employees who did any accounting work; (B) that the declarant and Triad kept and regularly relied on these spreadsheets and the data they contained; and (C) that the data were entered into the spreadsheets almost daily.</p>\n<p>[15]  Although some circuits have extended the business records exception beyond its original formulation, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Adefehinti,</i> 510 F.3d 319, 326 (D.C.Cir.2007) (explaining that \"a record of which a firm takes custody is ... `made' by the firm within the meaning of the rule ... and thus is admissible if all the other requirements are satisfied\" and listing cases to that effect), we need not reach that question. The records at issue here were so intimately integrated into Triad and the Defendants' own records that they were reliable enough to be admissible without the need to consider any such extension.</p>\n<p>[16]  Least of all the Defendants' argument based on their own sloppy record-keeping, which we have not yet bothered to mention: \"Thus, there is no way to distinguish the amount of sales for the Coral Calcium product that was being sold through the Coral Calcium infomercial.\" We reiterate that uncertain financial records are not sufficient to demonstrate that the FTC's reasonable estimate is inaccurate. <i>See </i><i>Febre,</i> 128 F.3d at 535.</p>\n<p>[17]  Specifically, Gorewitz testified that the records showed information entered by DMC-employed telemarketers while they were on the phone with customers. She further testified that she regularly produced reports of the sort introduced into evidence and relied on the data from the databases as presented in the report format. Gorewitz's firsthand observation of realtime data entry and regular reliance on reports in the same format and from the same data as the exhibits are sufficient to meet the criteria of Rule 803(6).</p>\n<p>[18]  The Defendants argue that the district court erred in imposing liability against BP. They present this argument as a footnoted afterthought (<i>see</i> D. Br. 44 n. 12); the FTC likewise responds to this argument in a footnote (<i>see</i> FTC Br. 52 n. 22). We continue the trend and harken one more time to <i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17. <i>See also </i><i>Nat'l Foreign Trade Council v. Natsios,</i> 181 F.3d 38, 60 n. 17 (1st Cir.1999) (\"We have repeatedly held that arguments raised only in a footnote or in a perfunctory manner are waived.\").</p>\n\n</div>",

Having been ordered to restore these millions to the customers they deceived, the Defendants now raise a multitude of challenges to two decisions of the district court: first, the court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff Federal Trade Commission (FTC), finding the Defendants liable for deceptive advertising; and second, the court's determination of damages after a bench trial on that issue. Despite the volume of the Defendants' arguments, we find no more substance in them than the district court found in their infomercials. We therefore affirm the district court <i>in toto.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Coral Calcium infomercial.</h2>\n<p>For purposes of introduction, a fairly simple recitation of only the uncontested facts will suffice. Greater detail will follow as necessary in the discussion section.</p>\n<p>The Defendants on appeal are Direct Marketing Concepts, Inc. (DMC), ITV Direct, Inc. (ITV), Donald Barrett, Robert Maihos, and BP International (BP).<sup>[1]</sup> Barrett and Maihos co-own ITV and DMC, both Massachusetts corporations; generally, ITV produces infomercials, and DMC distributes the infomercials, answers calls, and processes orders. BP is a holding corporation to which Barrett eventually (and secretly) transferred some of DMC's assets.</p>\n<p>Beginning in late 2001, DMC, Barrett, and Maihos became involved in marketing the product Coral Calcium by producing and distributing an infomercial promoting that product. These Defendants then processed calls and sold Coral Calcium to consumers.</p>\n<p>The infomercial for Coral Calcium relied on the purported expertise of Robert <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> Barefoot. In the infomercial, Barefoot asserted a number of claims regarding coral-derived calcium<sup>[2]</sup> and its supposed biological and medical properties. Barefoot claimed that all diseases are caused by a condition called acidosis:</p>\n<blockquote>Are you getting the minerals? And if you're not, you will become acidic and you will get one of the major diseases. You can have heart disease, cancer, lupus, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis. Name the disease, they're all caused by acidosis.</blockquote>\n<p>Barefoot then claimed that calcium derived from Okinawan coral cures these diseases:</p>\n<blockquote>[W]e've been studying the coral calcium and I can tell you there are tens of millions of people, millions of testimonials. I've had 1,000 people tell me how they've cured their cancer. I've witnessed people get out of wheelchairs with multiple sclerosis just by getting on the coral.</blockquote>\n<p>Barefoot asserted that coral-derived calcium was an effective cure for these diseases because it renders the body more alkaline, thereby curing acidosis:</p>\n<blockquote>Barefoot: By the time the average American is 35, he has more calcium going out of his body and into the body and that's when it starts. By the time he's 60, 98 percent are totally calcium deficient and that's why we have people over 60 with heart disease, you know, Lupus, Parkinson's. All these diseases are caused by acidosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Trudeau (host<sup>[3]</sup>): Pain, talk about pain. Read in your book if a person has pain, muscle pain, joint pain</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Barefoot: Yes, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Trudeau: they take calcium</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Barefoot: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Trudeau: their body turns from acid to alkaline, pain goes away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Barefoot: That's exactly</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Trudeau: Is that common?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Barefoot: Yes, yes, very common.</blockquote>\n<p>Barefoot went on to claim that coral-derived calcium is superior to other sources of calcium because it is 100% bioavailable, meaning that all coral-derived calcium that is ingested is also absorbed into the body. To bolster his claims, Barefoot noted that unspecified articles from the Journal of the American Medical Association and the New England Journal of Medicine \"said that calcium supplements reverse cancer... that's a quote.\"</p>\n<p>The infomercial directed potential customers to call an 800 number, on the other end of which DMC-employed telemarketers would follow a script directing them to tell potential customers that the product Coral Calcium would be 100% absorbed by their bodies and would combat degenerative diseases by rendering an acidic body more alkaline. Telemarketers were also directed to tell sick customers that they should take higher doses of Coral Calcium, up to three times the standard dose. During the relevant time period (from January 2002 to July 2003), the Coral Calcium infomercial generated $54,034,394.82 in sales, of which approximately $575,000 were transferred to Defendant BP.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> B. The Supreme Greens infomercial.</h2>\n<p>As with Coral Calcium, the Defendants were involved collectively in the production and airing of an infomercial for the product \"Supreme Greens,\" also called \"Supreme Greens with MSM.\" ITV produced the infomercial, which Barrett hosted; DMC processed calls and orders under Maihos's direction.</p>\n<p>The infomercial for Supreme Greens relied on the purported expertise of \"Dr.\" Alejandro Guerrero.<sup>[4]</sup> Like Barefoot, Guerrero claimed that many major diseases are caused by acidosis, and that these diseases can be prevented and cured by rendering the body more alkaline:</p>\n<blockquote>Barrett: Dr. Guerrero claims that most chronic degenerative diseasessuch as cancer, arthritis, diabetes, even the number one killer out there, heart disease can and are being cured....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Guerrero: So if we can change the body's fluids and tissues to a more alkaline base, now you have an environment that is no longer conducive for the proliferation or growth of a degenerative condition....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Barrett: ... If I alkalize my body, am I going to come up with one of these chronic degenerative diseases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Guerrero: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Barrett: Such as cancer, arthritis</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Guerrero: No.... I'm very confident in saying that, primarily because of the clinical studies we've done. I've seen it in myin myclinical practice. I've seen it every day in my clinical practice.</blockquote>\n<p>Going beyond even Barefoot, Guerrero also claimed that Supreme Greens can cause weight loss by restoring alkalinity because \"fat is your body's way of protecting itself from the acidic fluids.\"</p>\n<p>The infomercial directed potential customers to call an 800 number, on the other end of which DMC-employed telemarketers would follow a script directing them to ask potential customers about their health issues and then explain how Supreme Greens supposedly could address those issues. For example, if a customer said she had cancer, the telemarketer was supposed to respond that \"cancer is acidosis of the body and Supreme Greens alkalizes the body, and that's what you need, so you really want to take this.\" During the relevant time period (August 2003 to June 2004), Supreme Greens generated $14,683,436.24 in sales.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The FTC action.</h2>\n<p>In June 2004, the FTC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against a number of parties,<sup>[5]</sup> alleging violations of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 45 and 52. The FTC sought both injunctive relief and monetary equitable relief in order to redress customers who had purchased Coral Calcium or Supreme Greens in reliance on the Defendants' allegedly deceptive infomercials. In July 2008, the district court granted summary judgment against the Defendants on the issue of liability, holding that the challenged infomercials were misleading as a matter of law. In August 2009, after a bench trial, the district court entered two Final Orders and Judgments permanently enjoining the Defendants from running their deceptive infomercials and ordering disgorgement from the Defendants (excluding BP) in the amount of $48,220,499.12 and from BP in the amount <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> of $574,274.23. The Defendants now appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>The Defendants take a shotgun approach to their appeal, asserting that: (1) the district court applied an incorrect standard in finding them liable for deceptive advertising; (2) the record contained issues of fact as to whether they possessed sufficient substantiation for the claims asserted in the infomercials; (3) the claims made in the infomercials were mere puffery and were mollified by disclaimers, and therefore were not actionable; (4) Maihos is not individually liable as a matter of law; (5) the district court erred in calculating damages on the basis of the Defendants' gross receipts rather than net profits; (6) the district court erred in determining damages from January 2002 to February 2003; (7) the district court erred in determining damages from March 2003 to July 2003; and (8) the district court erred in determining damages from August 2003 to June 2004.</p>\n<p>The FTC seeks to uphold the judgment of the district court in all respects, asserting that: (1) the district court applied a correct standard in finding the Defendants liable for deceptive advertising; (2) the record contained vast swaths of uncontradicted evidence supporting the Defendants' lack of adequate substantiation for the claims asserted in the infomercials; (3) the claims in the infomercials were specific and definite and therefore not exempted from liability under the puffery or disclaimer rules; (4) as half-owner and officer of DMC, Maihos is individually liable; (5) the district court has broad discretion to fashion an equitable remedy, and exercised the discretion appropriately and in accordance with precedent; (6) the district court did not err in determining damages from January 2002 to February 2003; (7) the district court did not err in determining damages from March 2003 to July 2003; and (8) the district court did not err in determining damages from August 2003 to June 2004.</p>\n<p>This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review <i>de novo</i> both the district court's decision to grant a summary judgment motion, <i>see </i><i>Zimmerman v. Puccio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2528261\"><a href=\"/opinion/2528261/zimmerman-v-puccio/\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 70 (1st Cir.2010), and the district court's legal determinations after a bench trial, overturning the district court's factual determinations after a bench trial only in the case of clear error, <i>see </i><i>Wojciechowicz v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></span>, 66 (1st Cir.2009). Applying these familiar standards to the Defendants' arguments as appropriate, we see no need to diverge from the district court on any point.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The \"reasonable basis\" test is appropriate for deceptive advertising claims.</h2>\n<p>The Defendants challenge both the legal and factual bases for the district court's grant of summary judgment. We begin by teasing out the applicable law.</p>\n<p>Our starting point is the FTC statute, which provides that both \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce\" (15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1)) and \"disseminat[ing], or caus[ing] to be disseminated, any false advertisement ... in or having an effect upon commerce\" (15 U.S.C. § 52(a)) are \"unlawful.\" 15 U.S.C. § 55 defines the term \"false advertisement\" as \"an advertisement, other than labeling, which is misleading in a material respect....\" Given the strong similarity between the terms \"deceptive\" and \"misleading\", it is no surprise that sections 45 and 52 are sometimes applied in tandem as the basis for an FTC action against an alleged false advertiser; indeed, such a tandem <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> reading is expressly allowed by 15 U.S.C. § 52(b).</p>\n<p>When the FTC brings an action based on the theory that advertising is deceptive because the advertisers lacked a reasonable basis for their claims, the FTC must: (1) demonstrate \"what evidence would in fact establish such a claim in the relevant scientific community\"; and (2) \"compare[] the advertisers' substantiation evidence to that required by the scientific community to see if the claims have been established.\" <i>Removatron Intern. Corp. v.

Where the advertisers lack adequate substantiation evidence, they necessarily lack any reasonable basis for their claims. <i>See </i><i>Removatron,</i> 884 F.2d at 1498. And where the advertisers so lack a reasonable basis, their ads are deceptive as a matter of law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Defendants argue that there is a third prong to a deceptive advertising claim, asserting that the FTC was required and failedto prove that the infomercials were actually false. However, that argument is at odds with the cases cited above. Indeed, the Defendants cannot point to any source adequate to disrupt the FTC's and district court's firm grounding in case law.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Instead, the Defendants cite haphazardly to a federal statute (the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-417, 108 Stat. 4325), whose legal relevance (if any) the Defendants never explain, and to a smattering of First Amendment case law, without engaging in any application of those sources or attempting to produce so much as a rough sketch of a rule that might support their proposition. We can make neither heads nor tails of these citations, which have no clear relevance and which are completely devoid of context or developed argument. We therefore hold that the Defendants have waived any argument they might have raised under those sources, if any exists. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").</p>\n<p>In light of the Defendants' failure to raise any principled objection to the \"reasonable basis\" framework, which was carefully applied by the district court, the remainder of our analysis will follow that framework.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Defendants produced no actual substantiation for their health claims.</h2>\n<p>We must now consider the application of the <i>Removatron</i> \"reasonable basis\" test to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> the record on summary judgment. To recap, under this test (and applying the summary judgment standard), we must determine whether there was uncontroverted evidence regarding: (1) what sort of evidence would scientifically establish the claims the Defendants made in their infomercials; and (2) whether the Defendants were actually possessed of such evidence. <i>See </i><i>Removatron,</i> 884 F.2d at 1498. It is uncontested that the Defendants asserted the following claims in their infomercials: (1) coral-derived calcium supplements cure cancer, multiple sclerosis, and other degenerative diseases by rendering acidic bodies more alkaline, and they are 100% absorbed by the human body; and (2) Supreme Greens cure cancer and cause weight loss by rendering acidic bodies more alkaline. If these claims are not supported by sufficient scientific evidence, then liability follows. The Defendants claim that there are issues of fact on both prongs as applied to both infomercials.</p>\n<p>On the first prong, the FTC produced four expert declarations which demonstrated that the claims could be substantiated by double-blind, placebo-controlled human studies. Specifically, Dr. Richard Wood averred that \"[i]t is generally accepted that human studies are required to support a scientific finding concerning the bioavailability of a test compound in the human body.\" Dr. Maryfran Sowers provided specific examples of the scientific standards for, e.g., a chemical compound's effect on heart health: \"It is generally accepted among scientists that for a test compound or product to be considered as having a clinically meaningful effect on blood pressure, the changes in blood pressure caused by the compound or test must reach certain established thresholds,\" which she then described in numerical detail. Dr. Sowers outlined other contours of reliability, noting that prospective studies of 50,000 and 90,000 subjects were \"considered very reliable because of the large cohort involved and the breadth of information collected,\" whereas \"the early data collected in a longitudinal study is scientifically suspect until adequate temporal distance is established between when the calcium intake data was collected and the time when new or incident blood pressure could develop.\" Dr. Landon King averred that \"[i]n order to evaluate whether an intervention compound ... changed the pH balance of the body, researchers would develop a protocol for a controlled clinical trial that would measure the subjects' pH balance prior to receiving the test compound (or placebo) and at an appropriate period(s) after receiving either the test compound or a placebo.\" Dr. King noted specifically that \"[i]n order to claim that a product increases alkalinity, reasonable scientists would expect the product to have been subject to such an appropriate clinical study.\" Dr. Barrie Cassileth averred that \"[t]he most scientifically valid way to determine whether Supreme Greens (or any other product) produces any results is a double-blind, placebo controlled study.\"</p>\n<p>To be sure, there may be other scientific evidence that could be sufficient, and we may assume for these purposes that a double-blind study is not necessarily required. But the government established that some scientific evidence is required for substantiation, and thus satisfied the first prong of the <i>Removatron</i> test. Because the FTC produced affidavits which are more than adequate on their face to satisfy the first prong of a \"reasonable basis\" claim, and because the Defendants neither produced nor pointed to any evidence to raise even the tiniest of fact issues, summary judgment was appropriate on the first prong.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> On the second prong, the FTC relied on the same four expert declarations, in which the experts compared the Defendants' evidence to the available literature and concluded in each case that the Defendants' evidence was woefully inadequate. The experts specifically opined that: (1) there was some evidence that calcium might help to prevent colorectal cancer but no evidence that calcium cures cancer; (2) there was some evidence that calcium might lower blood pressure but none that it cures heart disease; (3) there was no evidence whatsoever that calcium has any effect on autoimmune disorders; (4) there has been no research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association or the New England Journal of Medicine indicating that calcium \"reverses\" cancer; (5) there is no evidence that any kind of calcium is 100% absorbed; (6) there is no evidence that any disease is caused by \"an overly acidic body\"; (7) there is no evidence that alkalinity cures cancer or heart disease; (8) there is no evidence that any ingredient of Supreme Greens can prevent, treat, or cure cancer, heart disease, or diabetes; and (9) there is no evidence that Supreme Greens may cause weight loss.</p>\n<p>The record contains a slew of other documents, including excerpts from Barefoot's books, excerpts from Barefoot's deposition testimony, excerpts from Guerrero's deposition testimony, a number of popular science and pseudoscientific articles, and one preliminary study. The Defendants claim that this evidence provided them with a reasonable basis for accepting the infomercials' claims as true. However, it is clear that none of this material comes close to establishing an issue of fact regarding the Defendants' woefully inadequate substantiation evidence.</p>\n<p>Barefoot's books present jumbles of quotes from scientists, scientific review articles, and scientific studies interspersed with references to Reader's Digest and other general-consumption reductions of these studies. His sources support such uncontroversial propositions as \"[t]he connection between the electrical activity of the cell and the release of the neurotransmitter is not direct; <i>an essential intermediary is the calcium ion.</i>\" Robert R. Barefoot &amp; Carl J. Reich, <i>The Calcium Factor</i> (2000) (internal citation removed) (emphasis Barefoot's). However, none of these scientists or studies supports the panacean claims made in the Coral Calcium infomercial; the claims are extrapolations, distortions, and sometimes, seemingly, utter fabrications. It appears to be no accident that neither Barefoot, nor any Defendant, nor any of the Defendants' attorneys has at any point in these proceedings identified any particular scientific study or studies to support the specific claims presented in the Coral Calcium infomercial. Indeed, Barefoot's deposition testimony primarily relies on appeals to generic authority; his standard rhetorical practice is to assert that there are myriad studies that support a given claim, without identifying any specifically.<sup>[7]</sup> When pressed for specificity, he generally refers the questioner to his books.<sup>[8]</sup> Nowhere in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> the record is there any support for, e.g., the following propositions: all diseases are caused by acidosis; calcium supplements cure cancer; calcium supplements cure multiple sclerosis; or coral-derived calcium is 100% absorbed into the body.</p>\n<p>Guerrero's testimony is even less compelling, given that he relies primarily on his own general experience as an alternative medicine practitioner, without reference to any studies at all. The Defendants make much of a double-blind, controlled, but also unpublished and preliminary study, which they assert supports the health claims advanced in the Supreme Greens infomercial; however, the study found, based on a sample size of sixteen people, that one of the ingredients in Supreme GreensMethyl-Sulfonyl-Methane, or MSMmight relieve arthritis pain and was therefore worthy of further study. This study on its face is grossly insufficient to support the Defendants' claims of Supreme Greens' efficacy in treating all diseases. And even the abstracts and excerpts from pseudoscientific articles, published in journals such as the non-peer reviewed and now-defunct Healthy &amp; Natural Journal and Natural Way for Better Health, do not support the specific claims made in either infomerciale.g., there is no support for the claims that the product Supreme Greens or any of their ingredients cure cancer, cure heart disease, or cause weight loss by alkalizing the body and thereby curing its need for fat as a protection against acid.</p>\n<p>Given the complete absence of support for the vast majority of the Defendants' health claimswhich absence the FTC's four experts also testified to on the basis of their own literature reviewswe easily could conclude that the Defendants lacked adequate substantiation under even the most lax standard of scientific reliability. Here, however, the FTC produced evidence establishing a rigorous standard of scientific reliability, and the record reveals that the Defendants fell well and unquestionably short of this standard. In all, the strong evidence establishing a scientific standard for evaluating the Defendants' advertising claims, the overwhelming evidence supporting the Defendants' lack of substantiation evidence, and the failure of the Defendants to indicate any evidence to raise an issue of fact on either point, compel the legal conclusion that the Defendants lacked a reasonable basis for the health claims they used to sell their products. <i>Cf. </i><i>Removatron,</i> 884 F.2d at 1498. The Defendants therefore engaged in deceptive advertising as a matter of law. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The Defendants made specific health claims which were not cured by general disclaimers.</h2>\n<p>The Defendants attempt to head off the above analysis by asserting that their infomercials advanced no actual health claims but, instead, presented only puffery which was further attenuated by the presence of general disclaimers. Where a claim is merely \"exaggerated advertising, blustering, and boasting upon which no reasonable buyer would rely,\" it may be un-actionable puffery. <i>See </i><i>Clorox Co. Puerto Rico v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Comm. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199109\"><a href=\"/opinion/199109/clorox-company-puert-v-proctor-gamble-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2000) (quotation marks omitted). However, \"specific and measurable\" claims and claims that may be literally true or false are not puffery, and may be the subject of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> deceptive advertising claims. <i>Id.</i> (quotation marks omitted). As set forth above, <i>passim,</i> the Defendants' infomercials presented specific and measurable health claims. These claims included definite statements that coral calcium cures cancer, autoimmune diseases, and pain by rendering acidic bodies more alkaline, as well as statements that Supreme Greens cure cancer, heart disease, and cause weight loss by rendering acidic bodies more alkaline. Due to their specificity and concreteness, such claims go far beyond puffery as a matter of law. <i>See id.</i> at 39.</p>\n<p>The presence of disclaimers does not provide any more assistance to the Defendants. This court has held that \"[d]isclaimers or qualifications in any particular ad are not adequate to avoid liability unless they are sufficiently prominent and unambiguous to change the apparent meaning of the claims and to leave an accurate impression. Anything less is only likely to cause confusion by creating contradictory double meanings.\" <i>Removatron,</i> 884 F.2d at 1497. The disclaimers at issue here did nothing to affect the meaning of the infomercials' health claims and were not even sufficient to cause confusion, given the clarity and concreteness of the claims. The infomercial transcripts reveal only disclaimers that the infomercials are paid advertising. The Defendants have presented no concrete evidence of any other attenuating messages.<sup>[9]</sup> In contrast, the health claims were bold and straightforward, presented by supposed experts as testable observations backed up by clinical trials and studies. Given the Defendants' lack of substantiation for these concrete claims framed by do-nothing disclaimers, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on the issue of the Defendants' liability for deceptive advertising.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Maihos is individually liable as an owner and corporate officer who lacked appropriate substantiation.</h2>\n<p>The Defendants present one last argument on liability, arguing that the district court erred in holding Maihos individually liable. Individual liability for deceptive advertising is appropriate where an individual (1) was a corporate officer with the capacity to make decisions regarding the challenged conduct, and (2) knew or should have known that there was no reasonable basis for the deceptive claims. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>FTC v. Publishing Clearing House, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"733340\"><a href=\"/opinion/733340/1997-1-trade-cases-p-71672-97-cal-daily-op-serv-2662-97-cal-daily/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1168</span></a></span>, 1170 (9th Cir. 1997). The FTC produced ample support for each proposition, and the Defendants produced no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p>The FTC produced evidence that Maihos was a 50% owner of DMC and ITV, that he controlled both companies' purse strings and day-to-day operations, and that he was the contact for an attorney <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> retained to review the infomercials for their legality under federal trade law.<sup>[10]</sup> Maihos (ignoring his status as an officer and half-owner of DMC) focuses on gaps in his responsibilities, relying on, e.g., his testimony that he did not edit the content of advertising. This is simply irrelevant. The question is whether he could have nipped the offending infomercials in the bud; the FTC produced evidence that he could, and he has produced no evidence even his own testimonyto indicate that he couldn't. <i>See </i><i>FTC v. Freecom Comm., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"165638\"><a href=\"/opinion/165638/ftc-v-freecom-comm-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1192</span></a></span>, 1205 (10th Cir.2005) (finding individual liability where \"[e]verybody knew that [the defendant] was the principal shareholder of the company and his opinions and advice and direction were listened to very carefully and were generally followed or heeded\").</p>\n<p>On the second prong, Maihos's knowledge, the FTC produced Maihos's own deposition testimony admitting that DMC did not have any substantiation for the claims made in either infomercial. Maihos also testified about an email he received from his then-girlfriend, a registered dietitian. The email provides both direct and circumstantial evidence of Maihos's knowledge. The email is direct evidence that the girlfriend informed Maihos that \"[c]alcium from anything cannot be 100 percent bioavailable\" and that \"[t]here's no evidence at all that Coral Calcium is better than ordinary calcium or has any special health-boosting properties.\" The girlfriend also asked Maihos, \"do you think there is a product ([over the counter] no less) that can prevent heart disease, diabetes, arthritis AND cancer?\" Maihos testified that he dismissed the email as mere skepticism. However, the email is also circumstantial evidence that Maihos actually requested the information from the girlfriend, who consulted third parties on Maihos's behalf. The email begins, \"Hello, as requested here are the responses I got.\" It also attached an email from the address Wic-talk@NAL. USDA.GOV, which a quick internet search reveals is an electronic discussion group promoted by the United States Department of Agriculture \"for use by individuals involved in providing nutrition services.\" <i>See</i> WIC-Talk, http://www.nal.usda.gov/ wicworks/Talk/index.html (last visited Oct. 19, 2010). Thus, the imputed exchange giving rise to the girlfriend's email implies that Maihos himself questioned the infomercials' claims. The FTC also produced evidence that Maihos had attended DMC meetings regarding the production of \"clean\" and \"re-edited\" versions of the infomercials while earlier versions of the infomercials still ran. Finally, the FTC produced evidence that an attorney suggested to Maihos in October 2003, well before the Defendants pulled the Supreme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> Greens infomercial off the air,<sup>[11]</sup> that the Supreme Greens infomercial required voluminous support and advanced \"BS\" claims.</p>\n<p>Again, the Defendants point to nothing that might challenge any of this evidence, relying instead on Maihos's protestations that he sincerely believed in the infomercials' health claims. It is true that two district court cases support the proposition that sincere belief may be an element in the individual liability calculus; however, even sincere belief is not sufficient here to overcome the overwhelming evidence that Maihos knew or, at the very least, should have known that the infomercials lacked any reasonable basis in scientific fact. <i>See </i><i>FTC v. Medical Billers Network, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460842\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460842/ftc-v-medical-billers-network-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></a></span>, 320-22 (S.D.N.Y.2008) (finding individual liability); <i>FTC v. Patriot Alcohol Testers, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1556412\"><a href=\"/opinion/1556412/ftc-v-patriot-alcohol-testers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span>, 860 n. 3 (D.Mass.1992). This is particularly so given that the patent ridiculousness of the infomercials' health claims was presented multiple times by multiple people to Maihos, who chose to remain willfully blind. Thus, there is no question that Maihos knew that the infomercials' claims lacked substantiation, that he had the authority to control DMC and ITV, and, nevertheless, that he did little or nothing. The district court did not err in holding Maihos individually liable for deceptive advertising, and we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Gross receipts are an appropriate basis for calculating damages.</h2>\n<p>Turning now to the issue of damages, the Defendants begin by arguing that damages for deceptive advertising are limited to actual profits, not gross receipts. If this were so, then at least part of the district court's damages award would be erroneous. However, the law allows for broad discretion in fashioning a remedy for deceptive advertising; many cases uphold rescission (effectively, restoring the parties to pre-sale status) or restitution (under these facts, the same) as appropriate remedies. <i>See </i><i>Trudeau,</i> 579 F.3d at 771 (noting that \"[c]onsumer loss is a common measure for civil sanctions in contempt proceedings and direct FTC actions\" and listing cases). Thus, consumer loss, as represented by the Defendants' gross receipts, would appear to be an appropriate measure of damages.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Defendants ask us to rely on <i>FTC v. Verity Int'l, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793859\"><a href=\"/opinion/793859/federal-trade-commission-v-verity-international-ltd-automatic/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span> (2d Cir.2006), for the proposition that the FTC's remedy is limited to the Defendants' profits rather than their gross receipts. <i>Verity</i>'s limited rule does not apply here.</p>\n<p>In <i>Verity,</i> a series of unrelated, non-party middlemen partook of the proceeds from the defendants' scheme before the defendants themselves got a bite. <i>See</i> 443 F.3d at 53 (describing the relationship as a \"multitiered, cascading-payment structure\"). The court found this payment structure highly relevant to the issue of damages, noting that \"in many cases in which the FTC seeks restitution, the defendant's gain will be equal to the consumer's loss\" but casting <i>Verity</i>'s facts as an exception limited to the situation \"when some middleman <i>not party to the lawsuit</i> takes some of the consumer's money before it reaches a defendant's hands.\" <i>Id.</i> at 68 (emphasis added); <i>see also </i><i>Trudeau,</i> 579 F.3d at 772 (describing <i>Verity</i> as holding only that \"certain circumstances require courts to limit disgorgement to the defendant's profits\"). Here, the Defendants <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> seek to inflate <i>Verity</i>'s exception so that it overshadows the rule.</p>\n<p>We are not persuaded. Because this set of facts lacks the non-party middleman that gave rise to the exception in <i>Verity,</i> we will follow the general rule. Here, the Defendants on appeal took in proceeds directly, except for roughly one year when fellow defendant (but non-appellant) Triad processed Coral Calcium orders. The FTC introduced ample evidence of the overall proceeds from Coral Calcium during this period; however, the parties' financial records were in such disarray that the actual split among the parties could not be determined.<sup>[12]</sup> The Defendants on appeal now claim that Triad siphoned off the vast majority of the proceeds, leaving them holding an empty bag, but we cannot tell whether this is the case. Because every entity that had received consumer money was a defendant, the district court held that gross receipts were an appropriate measure of damages; because records were unclear as to how much consumer money each defendant received, the district court evenly split the total receipts between DMC and Triad for the time period when Triad acted as a middleman. This was consistent with <i>Verity</i> and within the bounds of the district court's discretion in fashioning an equitable remedy. <i>See </i><i>Freecom,</i> 401 F.3d at 1202 n. 6 (noting that the FTC Act's \"grant of authority to provide injunctive relief carries with it the full range of equitable remedies, including the power to grant consumer redress\").</p>\n<p>Thus, the district court committed no error in resting its damages determination on the Defendants' gross receipts rather than their net profits, and we will proceed to review the court's calculation of what those gross receipts actually were. To determine the appropriate amount of damages in deceptive advertising cases, courts apply a burden-shifting scheme. First, the FTC must provide the court with a reasonable approximation of damages.<sup>[13]</sup><i>See </i><i>FTC v. Febre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747643\"><a href=\"/opinion/747643/federal-trade-commission-v-robert-j-febre-individually-and-as-an-officer/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">530</span></a></span>, 535 (7th Cir.1997). Both gross receipts and net customer loss are appropriate measures. <i>See id.</i>; <i>Freecom,</i> 401 F.3d at 1206. Once a reasonable approximation of damages has been provided, the defendant has an opportunity to demonstrate that the figures are inaccurate. <i>See </i><i>Febre,</i> 128 F.3d at 535. Any fuzzy figures due to a defendant's uncertain bookkeeping cannot carry a defendant's burden to show inaccuracy. <i>See id.</i> The district court and all parties find a rare point of agreement in the notion that this exercise may be broken down into three constituent time periodsJanuary 2002 to February 2003, March 2003 to July 2003, and August 2003 to June 2004each of which we will address in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. The district court's determination of damages from January 2002 to February 2003 was not erroneous.</h2>\n<p>The Defendants first challenge the propriety of the damages award for sales of Coral Calcium from January 2002 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> to February 2003, during which time DMC and fellow defendant (but non-appellant) Triad cooperated to sell Coral Calcium. The FTC introduced Exhibit 185 to support a finding that these defendants collectively received $40.9 million from sales of Coral Calcium from January 2002 to February 2003. A witnessSteven Ritchey, Triad's vice president in charge of accounting testified that gross receipts from this time period were $40.9 million. Even Defendant Barrett testified that gross receipts from this time period were around $40 million. The district court credited all of the above, found that gross receipts were $40.9 million, found that the records were unclear on the exact division of proceeds between DMC and Triad, and therefore judiciously split the award in two. This was all well within the court's discretion, and the Defendants do not raise any serious argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p>The Defendants do challenge Exhibit 185 as improperly admitted. Although there is adequate evidence to support the district court's determination even absent Exhibit 185, we will briefly explain why that exhibit's admission was appropriate. Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) provides that business records may be admissible if certified according to Fed.R.Evid. 902(11). Rule 902(11) provides that \"a duplicate of a domestic record of regularly conducted activity\" is admissible \"if accompanied by a written declaration of its custodian or other qualified person.\" This declaration must establish that the document:</p>\n<blockquote>(A) was made at or near the time of the occurrence of the matters set forth by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge of those matters; (B) was kept in the course of the regularly conducted activity; and (C) was made by the regularly conducted activity as a regular practice.</blockquote>\n<p>Fed.R.Evid. 902(11).</p>\n<p>The Defendants do not and cannot dispute that a declaration from Ilesh Sanghavi, who worked for Triad as an accountant, touched each of these elements, providing a solid basis in the record supporting the district court's decision.<sup>[14]</sup> Instead, the Defendants take issue with the FTC's declarant's wording (use of \"believe\" and failure to use the magic words \"regular course of business\"), the format of the exhibit (arguing that CDs are not produced in the regular course of business), and their own speculation that the exhibit might include third party data. None of these arguments provides any reason that we can discern to override the district court's exercise of discretion; the only one that might have any legal basis is the third party data argument, which nevertheless fails.<sup>[15]</sup> Similarly, the Defendants protest the FTC's relatively late submission of the authenticating affidavit without actually <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> suggesting that they have suffered any prejudice or otherwise indicating that their protestations would support reversal or remand. Again, we are reminded of and apply the principle that insufficiently developed arguments are waived. <i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17.</p>\n<p>The Defendants also argue that they met their burden of demonstrating the inaccuracy of the FTC's figures by arguing that DMC and Triad split only the proceeds from Coral Calcium sales, not the gross receipts; however, they point to no hard evidence to support this assertion, nor do they present any counter to the argument that they could have been held liable for the whole $40.9 million under joint and several liability. How to weigh the evidence is a question of fact on which we must defer to the district court. And, in the end, the district court had plenty of good reasons for its determination of damages from January 2002 to February 2003, the Defendants have presented no good reasons to upset that determination,<sup>[16]</sup> and we need go no further in order to affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>G. The district court's determination of damages from March 2003 to July 2003 was not erroneous.</h2>\n<p>The Defendants next challenge the damages award for sales of Coral Calcium from March 2003 to July 2003, at which point Triad was out of the picture and the Defendants on appeal acted in concert with one another exclusively. The only argument the Defendants can muster on this front is another challenge to the authentication of a set of business records admitted as Exhibits 187 and 209. These records are the products of DMC spreadsheets that show $13.1 million in sales of Coral Calcium from March 2003 to July 2003. These records were authenticated by live testimony, so only Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) and not Fed.R.Evid. 902(11) applies. To be admissible, a record must have been</p>\n<blockquote>made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record or data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness....</blockquote>\n<p>Fed.R.Evid. 803(6).</p>\n<p>Again, the Defendants do not and cannot dispute that an affidavitthis one from Karen Gorewitz, a DMC employee touched each element of proper authentication, providing a solid basis in the record supporting the district court's decision.<sup>[17]</sup> Instead, the Defendants generically attack Gorewitz's witness-stand testimony regarding the content of the affidavit, arguing that her lack of certainty on peripheral issuese.g., she did not know much about the \"Value\" column in the spreadsheets, or whether DMC kept the records in any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> particular formsomehow undermines the documents' authenticity. As is frequently the case throughout their brief, the Defendants fail to tie their general attacks into any sort of legal theory, conducting no analysis but citing to Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) and 902(11) without comment. Even assuming that they might have raised a valid legal argument (although again we find ourselves reminded of the rule that inadequately briefed issues are waived, <i>see </i><i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17), their attackconcerning the style more than the substance of the witness's testimonypresents the sort of second-guessing, cold-record inquiry that cautions deference to the district court. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Freeman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198886\"><a href=\"/opinion/198886/united-states-v-freeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span>, 339 (1st Cir.2000). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>H. The district court's determination of damages from August 2003 to June 2004 was not erroneous.</h2>\n<p>Finally, the Defendants challenge the damages award for sales of Supreme Greens from August 2003 to June 2004. They essentially argue that the FTC did not meet its initial burden of demonstrating a reasonable approximation of damages. This is so, they argue, because the Defendants' own records were in such disarray that the FTC could not draw a connection from the Supreme Greens receipts to the particular version of the Supreme Greens infomercial that the FTC proved to be deceptive. Purportedly, numerous other versions of the Supreme Greens infomercial existed and were aired at various times and places, although no one knows which version was aired at what time in any given place.</p>\n<p>The district court has discretion to determine a reasonable approximation of damages, and unclear financial records cannot carry a defendant's burden of demonstrating that such a reasonable approximation is inaccurate. <i>See </i><i>Febre,</i> 128 F.3d at 535. Here, the Defendants could not or would not produce an accounting that suggested even a rough approximation of what percentage of their Supreme Greens proceeds were based on the offending infomercial. Instead, in response to an interrogatory, they represented to the FTC that their records were subject to \"substantial confusion\" and that \"it is impossible to determine what sales are attributable to any specific version of the Supreme Greens infomercial.\" At this point, the FTC perhaps should have filed a motion to compel, given its apparent ability to produce order from chaos in this case. Instead, it allowed the records regarding which version of the Supreme Greens infomercial aired where and when to remain in disarray. This was the one hitch in an otherwise well-conducted case, but it is not enough to overcome the fact that, in the end, it is DMC's record-keeping that caused the uncertainty. And this hitch certainly does not establish the sort of clear error required to upset the district court's careful and considered ruling. Thus, the district court was within its discretion to estimate damages broadly based on the accounting information available to it, and the defendants produced nothing to overcome such an estimate. <i>See </i><i>Freecom,</i> 401 F.3d at 1206-07. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>On a well-developed record that reveals no significant factual disputes, the district court correctly granted summary judgment to the FTC on the issue of the Defendants' liability for deceptive advertising. On an equally well-developed record after a bench trial on damages, the district court correctly applied its equitable authority to fashion an appropriate remedy, ordering the Defendants to cure their customers in a way that their bogus supplements <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> could not.<sup>[18]</sup> Accordingly, we <i>affirm</i> the district court in all respects.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  We capitalize the word Defendant to refer to the Defendants on appeal, using lowercase when non-appellants are included, and providing clarification as appropriate.</p>\n<p>[2]  The name of the product was not featured in the infomercial, which only referred generally to the purported healing properties of calcium derived from coral skeletons harvested off the coast of Okinawa, Japan.</p>\n<p>[3]  Host Kevin Trudeau's issues with the FTC present a whole other story, set forth in <i>FTC v. Trudeau,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1357623\"><a href=\"/opinion/1357623/ftc-v-trudeau/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 757-62 (7th Cir. 2009) (including a brief discussion of Trudeau's involvement with the Coral Calcium infomercial).</p>\n<p>[4]  The infomercial presented Guerrero as a \"Doctor of Oriental Medicine,\" but Guerrero did not have any such degree.</p>\n<p>[5]  Including, among others, the Defendants on appeal as listed above, as well as Triad ML Marketing, Inc. (Triad), a corporation which will become relevant later.</p>\n<p>[6]  The Defendants do cite to a footnote in <i>FTC v. Enforma Natural Products, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785637\"><a href=\"/opinion/785637/federal-trade-commission-v-enforma-natural-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1204</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2004), for the proposition that the FTC must prove actual falsity. <i>Id.</i> at 1217 n. 14. However, the Ninth Circuit's footnoted aside is grounded in the earlier case <i>FTC v. Pantron I Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677119\"><a href=\"/opinion/677119/federal-trade-commission-plaintiff-appellant-cross-appellee-v-pantron-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1088</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1994), in which the court recognized that the FTC had abandoned a reasonable basis claim and was expressly proceeding on a theory of actual falsity. <i>See</i> 33 F.3d at 1096 (\"discuss[ing] only the falsity theory\" because \"the F.T.C. clearly and expressly abandoned the reasonable basis theory\"). Thus, <i>Pantron</i> recognized the distinction between a reasonable basis approachthe approach the FTC favors hereand a falsity approach. <i>See id.</i> And, contra the bald assertion in <i>Enforma,</i> the <i>Pantron</i> court stated plainly that \"a false advertisement need not even be false; it need only be misleading in a material respect.\" 33 F.3d at 1099 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the statement in <i>Enforma</i> on which the Defendants rely is not only dicta, but also incorrect.</p>\n<p>[7]  For example, Barefoot claims that he \"hired the No. 1 scientist in America ... and he did a peer-review study all over the world and came up with thousands and thousands of references\"; and that \"I could load you up where it would take you ten years to get out of this building before you read all the people that say calcium prevents cancer\"; and that \"[t]ens of thousands of scientists are saying that [calcium prevents cancer], and I can show you the documents.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  For example, when asked about the public availability of these uncountable studies, Barefoot said \"I have just finished a book called Let's Cure Humanity, in which I give you 1,000 scientific references. You're asking for them. I'm giving them to you. I will also give you 100 scientific quotations from the world's best scientists, and the quotations are startling: reverses PMS, it reverses cancer; that it reverses diabetes....\"</p>\n<p>[9]  The Defendants' brief claims that the infomercials contained \"disclaimers that stated the shows ... expressed the opinions of the speakers, and that the products were not intended to diagnose, treat or cure any disease.\" The brief contains no record cites, and the only relevant evidence below (not included in the appendix but pointed out at oral argument) is an affidavit from Luke Goljian, who testified that one version of the Supreme Greens infomercialthe ninth edit, which was \"sent out on several occasions to stations\" during an indeterminate time framedid include disclaimers fitting the description in the brief. But even assuming that these disclaimers actually accompanied either of the challenged infomercialsdespite the absence of any concrete support for that proposition in the recordsuch disclaimers would not leave an accurate impression but instead would only cause confusion. <i>Cf. </i><i>Removatron,</i> 884 F.2d at 1497. A statement that studies prove a product cures a certain disease, followed by a disclaimer that the statement is opinion and the product actually does not cure the disease, leaves an overall impression of nonsense, not clarity.</p>\n<p>[10]  Maihos also seeks to rely on two district court cases, both of which found straw officers and owners not individually liable. <i>See </i><i>FTC v. QT, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2396384\"><a href=\"/opinion/2396384/ftc-v-qt-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span>, 973 (N.D.Ill.2006) (corporate officer who \"had no involvement in the actions that led to corporate liability\" and \"has no set position and provides help around the office\" not liable); <i>United States v. Building Inspector of America, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2094868\"><a href=\"/opinion/2094868/united-states-v-building-inspector-of-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 519-20 (D.Mass. 1995) (finding liability where \"founder and president['s]\" claim of no involvement was \"entirely implausible\"; finding issue of fact as to liability for vice president with no evidence of actual authority or direct involvement; and finding no liability for treasurer with no evidence of any authority or any involvement). <i>Building Inspector</i> recognizes individual liability for a \"founder and president.\" <i>See</i> 894 F.Supp. at 519. In addition to being a founder, Maihos was the founding president of DMC. Maihos's extensive duties, involvement, and ownership interest in the corporate Defendants bring him entirely outside the ambit of these non-controlling cases to the extent they find no liability for corporate officers. <i>Cf. id.</i></p>\n<p>[11]  For example, there is evidence in the record that Donald Barrett sent an email to \"All Managers\" on February 23, 2004, stating that \"[w]e should now be using the original version Supreme Greens\" and that a new version would \"be testing in April or the beginning of next qtr.\"</p>\n<p>[12]  The FTC perhaps ought to have made more of an effort to nail down the details of the parties' finances during discovery, as we also note <i>infra</i> at 18, but there is no question that the primary fault lies with the Defendants.</p>\n<p>[13]  The Defendants argue that the district court did not hold the FTC to its initial burden of proving a reasonable approximation of damages, and therefore that the court engaged in premature burden shifting by relying on the Defendants' disheveled records as proffered by the FTC. This argument has no merit, as we uphold in each instance the evidentiary basis for the damages award and find that the FTC presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a reasonable approximation of damages.</p>\n<p>[14]  Specifically, the declaration identifies the documents as spreadsheets containing Triad's financial data and further provides: (A) that from June 2000 to July 2005, the declarant entered Triad's financial data into spreadsheets, maintained Triad's accounting records, and oversaw all of Triad's employees who did any accounting work; (B) that the declarant and Triad kept and regularly relied on these spreadsheets and the data they contained; and (C) that the data were entered into the spreadsheets almost daily.</p>\n<p>[15]  Although some circuits have extended the business records exception beyond its original formulation, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Adefehinti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187045\"><a href=\"/opinion/187045/united-states-v-adefehinti/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 326 (D.C.Cir.2007) (explaining that \"a record of which a firm takes custody is ... `made' by the firm within the meaning of the rule ... and thus is admissible if all the other requirements are satisfied\" and listing cases to that effect), we need not reach that question. The records at issue here were so intimately integrated into Triad and the Defendants' own records that they were reliable enough to be admissible without the need to consider any such extension.</p>\n<p>[16]  Least of all the Defendants' argument based on their own sloppy record-keeping, which we have not yet bothered to mention: \"Thus, there is no way to distinguish the amount of sales for the Coral Calcium product that was being sold through the Coral Calcium infomercial.\" We reiterate that uncertain financial records are not sufficient to demonstrate that the FTC's reasonable estimate is inaccurate. <i>See </i><i>Febre,</i> 128 F.3d at 535.</p>\n<p>[17]  Specifically, Gorewitz testified that the records showed information entered by DMC-employed telemarketers while they were on the phone with customers. She further testified that she regularly produced reports of the sort introduced into evidence and relied on the data from the databases as presented in the report format. Gorewitz's firsthand observation of realtime data entry and regular reliance on reports in the same format and from the same data as the exhibits are sufficient to meet the criteria of Rule 803(6).</p>\n<p>[18]  The Defendants argue that the district court erred in imposing liability against BP. They present this argument as a footnoted afterthought (<i>see</i> D. Br. 44 n. 12); the FTC likewise responds to this argument in a footnote (<i>see</i> FTC Br. 52 n. 22). We continue the trend and harken one more time to <i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17. <i>See also </i><i>Nat'l Foreign Trade Council v. Natsios,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198529\"><a href=\"/opinion/198529/national-foreign-v-natsios/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 60 n. 17 (1st Cir.1999) (\"We have repeatedly held that arguments raised only in a footnote or in a perfunctory manner are waived.\").</p>\n\n</div>",
