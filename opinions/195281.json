Petitioner Levon Garabedian seeks review of\n               \n\na final  order  of the  Board  of Immigration  Appeals  [BIA]\n\naffirming  a   denial  by   an  immigration  judge   [IJ]  of\n\npetitioner's  application  for discretionary  relief  from an\n\norder  of  deportation.    Petitioner  was  ordered  deported\n\nfollowing  a hearing  in  which he  was  found to  have  been\n\nconvicted of  possession of a controlled  substance (cocaine)\n\nand  of  two crimes  of entering  a  dwelling with  intent to\n\ncommit larceny, all in violation of the laws of Rhode Island.\n\nPetitioner  conceded that  he  was deportable  under  section\n\n241(a)(11) of  the Immigration  and Nationality Act  [INA], 8\n\nU.S.C.      1251(a)(11),  but  sought   discretionary  relief\n\npursuant  to section  212(c)  of the  same  act, 8  U.S.C.   \n\n1182(c).   A denial  of discretionary  relief will  be upheld\n\n\"unless  it  was   made  without   a  rational   explanation,\n\ninexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on\n\nan impermissible basis.\"  Williams v. INS, 773 F.2d 8, 9 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1985).  We affirm.\n\n          Petitioner's main contention is that the BIA failed\n\nto  provide   a  rational  explanation  for   its  denial  of\n\ndiscretionary relief.   Instead,  the BIA merely  stated that\n\n\"[u]pon a review of the record, we affirm the [IJ's] decision\n\nand dismiss  the appeal.\"  The  BIA did note that  it found a\n\n\"few  errors in  the Immigration  Judge's decision,  but they\n\nwere not  significant  and  in some  instances  were  to  the\n\n                             -2-\n\nbenefit of the [petitioner].\"  The BIA also found that the IJ\n\n\"did  not fail to consider  any of the  evidence submitted by\n\nthe [petitioner].\"  \n\n          While  the  BIA  has  the  discretionary  power  to\n\nconduct de novo review of a decision of an IJ, it is under no\n               \n\nobligation to do so.  Hazzard  v. INS, 951 F.2d 435, 439-40 &amp;\n                                     \n\nn.4 (1st Cir. 1991).  In this case, the BIA explicitly stated\n\nthat it was affirming the IJ's decision after having reviewed\n\nthe  record.   Since  petitioner  has  presented no  evidence\n\nchallenging the accuracy of this claim,  we must presume that\n\nthe BIA confirmed  the IJ's findings and adopted  his reasons\n\nfor denying the request for discretionary relief.  See McLeod\n                                                             \n\nv. INS, 802 F.2d 89,  95 n.8 (3d Cir. 1986)  (absent evidence\n      \n\nto the contrary,  BIA procedure in reviewing  decision of the\n\nIJ \"entitled to a presumption of regularity\").   The decision\n\nof the  IJ  contains  a detailed  summary  of  the  evidence,\n\nextensive factual  findings, and a  reasoned explanation  for\n\nhis denial of relief.  We are satisfied that this decision of\n\nthe IJ  provides the rational explanation  required to uphold\n\nthe BIA's denial of discretionary relief.  See DeLeon v. INS,\n                                                            \n\n547 F.2d  142, 149 (2d  Cir. 1976) (even  though BIA did  not\n\ndiscuss  claim, its  affirmance of decision  of the  IJ shows\n\nthat it  adequately considered claim  where most of  the IJ's\n\ndecision was  devoted to discussion of  claim), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n434 U.S. 841  (1977); Ramirez-Gonzalez v. INS, 695 F.2d 1208,\n                                             \n\n                             -3-\n\n1213 (9th Cir. 1983)  (even though BIA stated no  reasons for\n\nits decision, the decision  by the IJ which the  BIA affirmed\n\n\"supplies the reasons required by the regulation\").\n\n          Petitioner  also  claims  that  the  BIA  erred  in\n\nfailing  to   give  adequate   weight  to  evidence   of  his\n\nrehabilitation when  it denied him  relief.   See Gouveia  v.\n                                                         \n\nINS, 980 F.2d 814,  816 (1st Cir. 1992) (in  deciding whether\n   \n\nto  exercise  discretion, BIA  must balance  factors favoring\n\ndeportation against  factors supporting application,  such as\n\nevidence of  rehabilitation).  The record  indicates that the\n\nIJ  (and  implicitly  the  BIA) considered  the  evidence  of\n\nrehabilitation  but found  it, along  with the  other factors\n\nfavoring  relief, insufficient  to meet  petitioner's burden,\n\nsee Hazzard, 951  F.2d at 438, of showing that  he deserved a\n           \n\nfavorable exercise of discretion.1  As this court  has stated\n\nrepeatedly,  as  long  as  the  relevant  factors  have  been\n\nconsidered, it belongs  to the BIA and  not to this court  to\n\nweigh  the  various  factors  in  arriving  at  the  ultimate\n\ndecision  of  whether to  grant  discretionary  relief.   See\n                                                             \n\nGouveia, 980 F.2d at 819.  \n       \n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\n1.  The immigration  judge did question \"whether  or not such\nadvances  [were] primarily  due  to  the pending  deportation\nproceedings.\"    The  record  contains  evidence  which would\nsupport this evaluation.\n\n                             -4-\n",
