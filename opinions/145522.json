Cruickshank, with whom D. Ethan Jeffery and Hanify\n& King were on brief, for appellant.\n     Todd B. Gordon, with whom Stephen F. Gordon and The Gordon Law\nFirm were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           April 29, 2010\n\f          Per Curiam.    The question raised by this adversary\n\nproceeding in the bankruptcy court is whether a non-debtor spouse\n\nis entitled to a portion of a prepetition tax refund, where the\n\nparties filed a joint return and the non-debtor spouse earned no\n\nincome for the tax year for which the return was filed.   Because a\n\ndebtor's interest in property is defined by state law, Butner v.\n\nUnited States, 440 U.S. 48, 54-55 (1979), we look to the law of\n\nMassachusetts in order to determine the respective interests of\n\nspouses in their jointly-filed tax refund.       The courts of the\n\nCommonwealth have not addressed this question. While several state\n\nstatutes touch on the issue indirectly by describing joint property\n\ninterests and the property rights of married individuals, none of\n\nthese statutes tells us how Massachusetts would treat the income\n\ntax refund in this case.       In the absence of any controlling\n\nstatutes or precedents from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt (\"SJC\"), we conclude that we should certify the question to\n\nthe Court, pursuant to its Rule 1:03.    See In re Engage, Inc., 544\n\nF.3d 50, 51 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                 I.\n\n          The facts underlying this appeal are not in dispute.\n\nJanice Hundley, the appellee, and her husband, Kirk Hundley filed\n\na joint income tax return in 2002.    The income reported on the tax\n\nreturn was earned by Kirk Hundley.      According to the appellant\n\n(Hundley's bankruptcy trustee), Kirk Hundley's income was the sole\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fsource of the payments noted in the 2002 tax return.            The couple\n\nlisted exemptions for themselves and each of their three children.\n\nIn May 2006, they amended their 2002 tax return in order to carry-\n\nback losses from 2004.         The losses were connected to various\n\nbusiness endeavors of Kirk Hundley's.          The amended return showed\n\nthat the Internal Revenue Service owed the Hundleys a refund of\n\napproximately $94,910 (\"the refund\").\n\n           Kirk Hundley filed a voluntary petition for relief under\n\nChapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in April 2006.1            In\n\nhis bankruptcy filing, he disclosed his one half interest in the\n\njoint tax refund, which he valued at $41,500.           Appellant, Janice\n\nMarsh (\"the trustee\"), was named the trustee for Mr. Hundley's\n\nbankruptcy estate.    In June 2006, the trustee applied to receive\n\nthe entire federal income tax refund associated with the Hundleys'\n\namended 2002 tax return.       In January 2007, the Internal Revenue\n\nService sent the trustee a check in the amount of $93,362 (the\n\nRefund) made out to Kirk Hundley c/o Janice G. Marsh.\n\n           In January 2009, Janice Hundley filed a complaint in the\n\nUnited   States   Bankruptcy    Court    for   the   Western   District   of\n\nMassachusetts seeking a determination that she was entitled to a\n\nfifty percent interest in the refund.          She requested that she be\n\n\n\n     1\n       In Segal v. Rochelle, the Supreme Court held that a federal\ntax refund received by a debtor postpetition is sufficiently rooted\nin the prebankruptcy past to be regarded as property of the estate.\n382 U.S. 375, 380 (1966).\n\n                                   -3-\n\fgranted her half of the refund as well as any interest the trustee\n\nhad   collected   on   that   half   of    the   refund.     Janice   Hundley\n\nsubsequently moved for summary judgment on her claim.                 After a\n\nhearing, the bankruptcy court granted her motion.             In its order,\n\nthe court wrote that its previous decision in In re Trickett, 391\n\nB.R. 657 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2008), was controlling and required that\n\nthe refund be apportioned 50/50 between the spouses.\n\n           Following    the   bankruptcy     court's   May   order    granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Janice Hundley, the trustee filed a\n\nNotice of Appeal to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 158.     In response, Janice Hundley filed a Request for\n\nCertification for Direct Appeal to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 158(d)(2) and Bankruptcy Rule 8001(f), which the trustee opposed.\n\nThe bankruptcy court entered a Certification of Direct Appeal on\n\nJune 4, 2009.      On July 2, 2009, we granted Janice Hundley's\n\npetition for authorization to take this direct appeal.\n\n                                     II.\n\n           At its discretion, a federal court of appeals may certify\n\nquestions of state law to the state's highest court.           Lehman Bros.\n\nv. Schein, 416 U.S. 386, 391 (1974).         When Massachusetts law is at\n\nissue, the SJC has provided that we may certify questions to it in\n\ncases where we \"find[] no controlling precedent and where the\n\nquestions may be determinative of the pending cause of action.\" In\n\nre Engage, Inc., 544 F.3d at 52; Mass. S.J.C. R. 1:03 (providing\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\ffor certification \"if there are involved in any proceeding before\n\n[the federal court] questions of law of this State which may be\n\ndeterminative of the cause then pending in the certifying court and\n\nas to which it appears to the certifying court there is no\n\ncontrolling   precedent   in   the    decisions   of   this   court\").   On\n\noccasion, we will certify such questions to a state's highest court\n\non our own motion when neither party has requested certification.\n\nMaine Drilling, 34 F.3d at 3.        Although the parties have not asked\n\nfor certification, we find that this is a case that satisfies the\n\nconditions of the SJC's certification rule and justifies the\n\nexercise of our discretion in favor of certification.           The outcome\n\nof this adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court will be wholly\n\ndetermined by the resolution of the dispute over who owns the tax\n\nrefund under Massachusetts law.            The refund issue, while not\n\ncommonplace, is likely to recur in the bankruptcy context and its\n\nresolution may require policy judgments about the applicability of\n\nMassachusetts law that the SJC is in the best position to make.\n\nSee In re Engage, 544 F.3d at 53 (\"[C]ertification is particularly\n\nappropriate here since the answers to these questions may hinge on\n\npolicy judgments best left to the Massachusetts court and will\n\ncertainly have implications beyond these parties.\").\n\n          The analysis in this dispute over ownership of a tax\n\nrefund begins with Section 541(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, which\n\nbroadly defines property of the bankruptcy estate as \"all legal and\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fequitable    interests         of   the   debtor     in     property    as    of      the\n\ncommencement\"      of    the    bankruptcy       proceedings.          11    U.S.C.    §\n\n541(a)(1).    Neither party disputes that at least part of the tax\n\nrefund was property of the debtor, Mr. Hundley, at the commencement\n\nof the bankruptcy proceeding. Rather, the parties contest how much\n\nof the expected refund was his property given that the tax return\n\nwas filed by the Hundleys jointly.\n\n            The Supreme Court has made clear that in bankruptcy\n\nproceedings \"[p]roperty interests are created and defined by state\n\nlaw.\"    Butner, 440 U.S. at 55.            In turning to state law, however,\n\nwe find no specific articulation of the property interests arising\n\nfrom a joint tax refund.              While there are several bodies of\n\nMassachusetts      law    that      might       influence    the     state     court's\n\ndetermination of the property interest of a spouse in a joint tax\n\nrefund, none offers us \"compelling guidance.\"                  In re Engage, 544\n\nF.3d at 56 (quotation marks omitted).               We will not attempt, as is\n\noften our practice in certification opinions, to outline what we\n\nbelieve to be the relevant law because to do so in this case would\n\nentail    making    significant       judgments      about     the     relevance      of\n\nparticular statutory provisions and precedents.                      We believe the\n\nbetter course is to leave it to the parties and to the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court to argue for and to judge what law is applicable\n\nhere.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f           We    therefore    certify   to   the    Massachusetts       SJC   the\n\nfollowing questions:\n\n           1.    Under   Massachusetts       law,   does    the   tax    refund\n\nconstitute the property of Kirk Hundley alone or is it property in\n\nwhich Janice Hundley has a property interest?\n\n           2. If Janice Hundley has a property interest in the tax\n\nrefund,   what   principles    and   potential      facts   are   relevant     to\n\ndetermining the extent of her interest?\n\n           We would welcome the advice of the SJC on any other\n\nrelevant aspect of Massachusetts law which it believes would aid in\n\nthe proper resolution of the issue.\n\n           The clerk of this court is directed to forward to the\n\nMassachusetts SJC, under the official seal of this court, a copy of\n\nthe certified questions and our decision in this case, along with\n\na copy of the briefs and appendix filed by the parties, which set\n\nforth all facts relevant to the issues certified.                   We retain\n\njurisdiction pending that court's determination.\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f",

Marsh.</p>\n<p>In January 2009, Janice Hundley filed a complaint in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Massachusetts seeking a determination that she was entitled to a fifty percent interest in the refund. She requested that she be granted her half of the refund as well as any interest the trustee had collected on that half of the refund. Janice Hundley subsequently moved for summary judgment on her claim. After a hearing, the bankruptcy court granted her motion. In its order, the court wrote that its previous decision in <i>In re Trickett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1878022\"><a href=\"/opinion/1878022/in-re-trickett/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span> (Bankr.D.Mass.2008), was controlling and required that the refund be apportioned 50/50 between the spouses.</p>\n<p>Following the bankruptcy court's May order granting summary judgment in favor of Janice Hundley, the trustee filed a Notice of Appeal to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 158. In response, Janice Hundley filed a Request for Certification for Direct Appeal to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*98</span> and Bankruptcy Rule 8001(f), which the trustee opposed. The bankruptcy court entered a Certification of Direct Appeal on June 4, 2009. On July 2, 2009, we granted Janice Hundley's petition for authorization to take this direct appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>At its discretion, a federal court of appeals may certify questions of state law to the state's highest court. <i>Lehman Bros. v. Schein,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109015\"><a href=\"/opinion/109015/lehman-brothers-v-schein/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 391, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109015\"><a href=\"/opinion/109015/lehman-brothers-v-schein/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span> (1974). When Massachusetts law is at issue, the SJC has provided that we may certify questions to it in cases where we \"find[] no controlling precedent and where the questions may be determinative of the pending cause of action.\" <i>In re Engage, Inc.,</i> 544 F.3d at 52; Mass. S.J.C. R. 1:03 (providing for certification \"if there are involved in any proceeding before [the federal court] questions of law of this State which may be determinative of the cause then pending in the certifying court and as to which it appears to the certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of this court\"). On occasion, we will certify such questions to a state's highest court on our own motion when neither party has requested certification. <i>Maine Drilling,</i> 34 F.3d at 3. Although the parties have not asked for certification, we find that this is a case that satisfies the conditions of the SJC's certification rule and justifies the exercise of our discretion in favor of certification. The outcome of this adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court will be wholly determined by the resolution of the dispute over who owns the tax refund under Massachusetts law. The refund issue, while not commonplace, is likely to recur in the bankruptcy context and its resolution may require policy judgments about the applicability of Massachusetts law that the SJC is in the best position to make. <i>See </i><i>In re Engage,</i> 544 F.3d at 53 (\"[C]ertification is particularly appropriate here since the answers to these questions may hinge on policy judgments best left to the Massachusetts court and will certainly have implications beyond these parties.\").</p>\n<p>The analysis in this dispute over ownership of a tax refund begins with Section 541(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, which broadly defines property of the bankruptcy estate as \"all legal and equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement\" of the bankruptcy proceedings. 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1). Neither party disputes that at least part of the tax refund was property of the debtor, Mr. Hundley, at the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding. Rather, the parties contest how much of the expected refund was his property given that the tax return was filed by the Hundleys jointly.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has made clear that in bankruptcy proceedings \"[p]roperty interests are created and defined by state law.\" <i>Butner,</i> 440 U.S. at 55, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110017\"><a href=\"/opinion/110017/butner-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>. In turning to state law, however, we find no specific articulation of the property interests arising from a joint tax refund. While there are several bodies of Massachusetts law that might influence the state court's determination of the property interest of a spouse in a joint tax refund, none offers us \"compelling guidance.\" <i>In re Engage,</i> 544 F.3d at 56 (quotation marks omitted). We will not attempt, as is often our practice in certification opinions, to outline what we believe to be the relevant law because to do so in this case would entail making significant judgments about the relevance of particular statutory provisions and precedents. We believe the better course is to leave it to the parties and to the Supreme Judicial Court to argue for and to judge what law is applicable here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*99</span> We therefore certify to the Massachusetts SJC the following questions:</p>\n<p>1. Under Massachusetts law, does the tax refund constitute the property of Kirk Hundley alone or is it property in which Janice Hundley has a property interest?</p>\n<p>2. If Janice Hundley has a property interest in the tax refund, what principles and potential facts are relevant to determining the extent of her interest?</p>\n<p>We would welcome the advice of the SJC on any other relevant aspect of Massachusetts law which it believes would aid in the proper resolution of the issue.</p>\n<p>The clerk of this court is directed to forward to the Massachusetts SJC, under the official seal of this court, a copy of the certified questions and our decision in this case, along with a copy of the briefs and appendix filed by the parties, which set forth all facts relevant to the issues certified. We retain jurisdiction pending that court's determination.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In <i>Segal v.
