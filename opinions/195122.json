Defendant-appellant  John Arias pled guilty\n               \n\nto a charge of possession  of an unregistered firearm, see 26\n                                                          \n\nU.S.C.   5861(d), and a charge of possession of a weapon by a\n\nconvicted felon, see  18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1).   At sentencing,\n                    \n\nthe district court  applied the cross-reference  provision of\n\nU.S.S.G.    2K2.11 and set  appellant's base offense level at\n\n28, based on  the applicable guideline for  attempted murder.\n\nSee U.S.S.G.    2X1.1, 2A2.1.  Arias challenges his sentence,\n   \n\nclaiming  that  the  district  court improperly  applied  the\n\ncross-reference  provision.    Arias  also  appeals from  the\n\nimposition of a fine and the cost  of supervised release.  We\n\naffirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     We  take  the  relevant   facts  from  the  pre-sentence\n\ninvestigation  report   (PSI)  and  the  transcript   of  the\n\nsentencing hearing.  See, e.g., United States v. Connell, 960\n                                                        \n\n                    \n\n1.  The guideline states in relevant part:\n\n     (c)  Cross Reference\n\n          (1)  If the defendant used or possessed any firearm\n               or   ammunition   in   connection   with   the\n               commission or attempted  commission of another\n               offense, . . . apply--\n\n               (A)      2X1.1   (Attempt,   Solicitation,  or\n                    Conspiracy)  in  respect  to  that  other\n                    offense, if  the resulting  offense level\n                    is greater than  that determined above; .\n                    . .\n\nU.S.S.G.   2K2.1(c)(1)(A)  (Nov. 1992).\n\n                             -2-\n\nF.2d 191, 192-93  (1st Cir. 1992).  On  November 15, 1992, at\n\napproximately  11:15  p.m., appellant  attempted to  enter La\n\nFrangancia Nightclub  in Providence.   Harry  Van Leuven  and\n\nBienvenido Marrero were working a security detail there.  The\n\nowner  of the nightclub asked Van  Leuven to remove appellant\n\nfrom the premises because he  had caused trouble there in the\n\npast.   Van  Leuven  did  so, assisted  by  Marrero.   Before\n\ndeparting, appellant  said that he  would come back  and kill\n\nVan Leuven.\n\n     Approximately fifteen minutes  later, appellant returned\n\nwith a loaded  sawed-off shot gun and  entered the nightclub.\n\nHe pointed  the shotgun at  Van Leuven.  Marrero  grabbed the\n\nbarrel of the  shotgun and jerked it up  towards the ceiling.\n\nThe shotgun fired, blowing a hole in the ceiling.  Continuing\n\nto hold  the shotgun,  Marrero pushed  appellant outside  the\n\nclub  and into the  street.  There,  appellant struggled over\n\nthe gun with Van Leuven  and Marrero.  The shotgun discharged\n\nagain, hitting no  one.  Shortly  thereafter, Van Leuven  and\n\nMarrero subdued appellant.\n\n     After Arias  pled guilty on  February 16, 1993,  the PSI\n\nwas  prepared.   The report concluded  that the  base offense\n\nlevel should  be set at  28, pursuant to  the cross-reference\n\nprovision  of   2K2.1, because appellant  used the shotgun in\n\nconnection with the  offense of attempted murder.   Appellant\n\nobjected to  this application of  the guidelines,  contending\n\n                             -3-\n\nthat  the  cross-referenced   offense  should  be  aggravated\n\nassault.\n\n     The  PSI  determined the  fine  range to  be  $10,000 to\n\n$100,000 pursuant to U.S.S.G.   5E1.2(c)(3).  With respect to\n\nappellant's ability  to pay a  fine, the  PSI concluded  that\n\n\"[b]ased upon the defendant's  financial profile, it  appears\n\nthat  he would  have little  ability to  pay  a fine.\"2   The\n\nreport  further  stated,  however, that  \"[Arias]  should  be\n\ncapable  of securing employment upon his release.\"  Appellant\n\nobjected to  the \"insinuation\" that  he would be able  to pay\n\nthe costs of supervised release.\n\n     At  sentencing, the  district court adopted  the factual\n\nfindings and guideline application in the PSI.  After setting\n\nthe  base offense  level  by reference  to the  guideline for\n\nattempted  murder,   the  district   court  established   the\n\nguideline sentencing range at 63-78  months (adjusted offense\n\nlevel--25;  criminal  history  category--II)  and  imposed  a\n\nsentence  at the  bottom end  of  the sentencing  range.   In\n\naddition, the court imposed a fine of $50 on each count ($100\n\ntotal),  due immediately, plus the cost of supervised release\n\n(a total of $4,150.80), to be paid in monthly installments of\n\n$115.30 after release from imprisonment.\n\n                    \n\n2.  Arias, a  twenty-nine year old,  was married and  had one\nchild.   He reported that he had no  assets, and that he owed\n$700 in medical bills.  His employment history was sparse and\nconsisted  primarily of low-paying  factory jobs.   He listed\nboth his monthly income and expenses at $640.  \n\n                             -4-\n\n                             II.\n\n     On  appeal,  Arias  challenges  the application  of  the\n\ncross-reference provision.   According to Arias, it  is ultra\n                                                             \n\nvires the  power of the  Sentencing Commission to  punish for\n     \n\nconduct that  violates state, but  not federal,  law.   Arias\n\nalso argues that he was denied due process of law because the\n\ndistrict  court  sentenced  him for  committing  an  offense,\n\nattempted murder, for which he had not been convicted.  \n\n     These claims were  not raised below and  are, therefore,\n\nwaived.  See United States v.  Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 717  (1st\n                                    \n\nCir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1005 (1993).  Even if we\n                        \n\nwere to address the issues  on the merits, we would disagree.\n\nThose  circuits which  have  considered  whether  the  cross-\n\nreference provision of   2K2.1 applies to state  offenses, as\n\nwell as federal offenses, have held that it does.  See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nUnited States v.  Carroll, 3 F.3d 98, 101-02  (4th Cir. 1993)\n                         \n\n(concluding that the Sentencing Commission did not exceed its\n\nmandate by requiring  a cross-reference to a  state offense);\n\nsee also United  States v. Anderson, 5 F.3d  795, 802-03 (5th\n                                   \n\nCir. 1993)  (interpreting    2K2.1(c) to  allow a  sentencing\n\ncourt  to use  state offenses to  enhance a  firearms offense\n\nlevel).  Section 2K2.1(c) has also uniformly been interpreted\n\nto extend to uncharged conduct.   See, e.g., United States v.\n                                                          \n\nCorbin, 998 F.2d 1377, 1382-85 (7th Cir. 1993); United States\n                                                             \n\nv.  Smith, 997  F.2d 396,  397  (8th Cir.  1993); cf.  United\n                                                             \n\n                             -5-\n\nStates v. Blanco,  888 F.2d 907, 909 (1st  Cir. 1989) (noting\n                \n\nthat  the  guidelines  embody  \"a  compromise  .  .  .  among\n\nconsiderations that favor a `real offense'  sentencing system\n\nand  those that favor a  `charge offense' system).    We have\n\npreviously  rejected the argument that sentencing a defendant\n\non   the  basis,   in   part,   of   uncharged   conduct   is\n\nunconstitutional.  United States v.  Sanders, 982 F.2d 4,  10\n                                            \n\n(1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 2937 (1993).\n                             \n\n     Appellant also reiterates  on appeal his argument  below\n\nthat the  district court  erred in finding  that his  conduct\n\nwhile  in possession  of the  firearm  amounted to  attempted\n\nmurder  rather  than  assault.    We  disagree.    Proof   at\n\nsentencing need only  be by a preponderance  of the evidence.\n\nUnited States  v. Jackson, 3  F.3d 506, 509 (1st  Cir. 1993).\n                         \n\nIn  the instant  case, Arias  threatened to  kill  Van Leuven\n\nbefore leaving the nightclub.   Shortly thereafter, appellant\n\nreturned to  the club with a sawed-off shotgun--a very lethal\n\nweapon at close range--and pointed it directly at Van Leuven.\n\nThe weapon discharged  as the barrel was diverted  upwards by\n\nMarrero.   After the shotgun  fired, appellant   struggled to\n\nretain possession  of the  weapon.  We  cannot say,  on these\n\nfacts, that  the district court  erred in finding  that Arias\n\nintended  to kill, rather  than simply frighten,  Van Leuven.\n\nSee United States v.  Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir. 1993)\n                              \n\n                             -6-\n\n(a sentencing  court's factbound determinations  are reviewed\n\nfor clear error).\n\n                             III.\n\n     The  remaining issue is whether the district court erred\n\nin imposing  a fine  and the costs  of supervised  release on\n\nappellant.  Arias contends that the district court should not\n\nhave imposed any  fine or costs because he  was indigent, his\n\nwife and daughter were  receiving welfare benefits, he had  a\n\nlimited  educational  and employment  background, and  he was\n\nsubject to deportation upon release from imprisonment.\n\n     We  discern no  error.   Both  18 U.S.C.    3572(a)  and\n\nU.S.S.G. 5E1.2(d)(2) contemplate that  a defendant's \"earning\n\ncapacity\"  should  be  considered in  determining  whether to\n\nimpose a fine, as well  as the amount.  Appellant is  twenty-\n\nnine   years  old  and  is  in  good  health.    He  will  be\n\napproximately  thirty-four years old when he is released from\n\nprison.    Although  he did  not  finish  high  school, Arias\n\ncompleted  a certificate program  in machine processing.   He\n\nwas employed at the time of his arrest and reported an income\n\nof $640 per  month.  The PSI concluded that he should be able\n\nto secure employment upon his release from incarceration.   \n\n     Under the circumstances, we find that the district court\n\nacted well within its discretion  in imposing a $100 fine and\n\nthe costs  of  supervised  release.   See  United  States  v.\n                                                         \n\nSavoie, 985 F.2d 612, 620 (1st Cir. 1993) (imposition of fine\n      \n\n                             -7-\n\nunder  the guidelines is  reviewed for abuse  of discretion).\n\nThe fact that the district  court imposed only a nominal fine\n\nand did  not require  Arias  to pay  government costs  during\n\nincarceration  reflects  an  appreciation  by  the  court  of\n\nappellant's  financial status.   See, e.g., United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nPilgrim Mkt. Corp., 944 F.2d 14, 23 (1st Cir.  1991).  Should\n                  \n\nthe appellant be unable to  pay even this minimal amount, and\n\nshould the government seek to incarcerate him for nonpayment,\n\nappellant  would  have ample  administrative remedies  at his\n\ndisposal.   See, e.g., United  States v. Levy, 897  F.2d 596,\n                                             \n\n598 (1st Cir. 1990); Santiago v.

In addition, the court imposed a fine of $50 on each count ($100 total), due immediately, plus the cost of supervised release (a total of $4,150.80), to be paid in monthly installments of $115.30 after release from imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Arias challenges the application of the cross-reference provision.  According to Arias, it is ultra vires the power of the Sentencing Commission to punish for conduct that violates state, but not federal, law.  Arias also argues that he was denied due process of law because the district court sentenced him for committing an offense, attempted murder, for which he had not been convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These claims were not raised below and are, therefore, waived.   See United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 717 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1005 (1993).  Even if we were to address the issues on the merits, we would disagree.  Those circuits which have considered whether the cross-reference provision of Sec. 2K2.1 applies to state offenses, as well as federal offenses, have held that it does.   See, e.g., United States v. Carroll, 3 F.3d 98, 101-02 (4th Cir. 1993) (concluding that the Sentencing Commission did not exceed its mandate by requiring a cross-reference to a state offense);   see also United States v. Anderson, 5 F.3d 795, 802-03 (5th Cir. 1993) (interpreting Sec. 2K2.1(c) to allow a sentencing court to use state offenses to enhance a firearms offense level).  Section 2K2.1(c) has also uniformly been interpreted to extend to uncharged conduct.   See, e.g., United States v. Corbin, 998 F.2d 1377, 1382-85 (7th Cir. 1993);   United States v. Smith, 997 F.2d 396, 397 (8th Cir. 1993);  cf.  United</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">States v. Blanco, 888 F.2d 907, 909 (1st Cir. 1989) (noting that the guidelines embody \"a compromise ... among considerations that favor a 'real offense' sentencing system and those that favor a 'charge offense' system).  We have previously rejected the argument that sentencing a defendant on the basis, in part, of uncharged conduct is unconstitutional.   United States v. Sanders, 982 F.2d 4, 10 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S.

We disagree.  Proof at sentencing need only be by a preponderance of the evidence.   United States v. Jackson, 3 F.3d 506, 509 (1st Cir. 1993).  In the instant case, Arias threatened to kill Van Leuven before leaving the nightclub.  Shortly thereafter, appellant returned to the club with a sawed-off shotgun-a very lethal weapon at close range-and pointed it directly at Van Leuven.  The weapon discharged as the barrel was diverted upwards by Marrero.  After the shotgun fired, appellant struggled to retain possession of the weapon.  We cannot say, on these facts, that the district court erred in finding that Arias intended to kill, rather than simply frighten, Van Leuven.   See United States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir. 1993)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a sentencing court's factbound determinations are reviewed for clear error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining issue is whether the district court erred in imposing a fine and the costs of supervised release on appellant.  Arias contends that the district court should not have imposed any fine or costs because he was indigent, his wife and daughter were receiving welfare benefits, he had a limited educational and employment background, and he was subject to deportation upon release from imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no error.  Both 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3572(a) and U.S.S.G. 5E1.2(d)(2) contemplate that a defendant's \"earning capacity\" should be considered in determining whether to impose a fine, as well as the amount.  Appellant is twenty-nine years old and is in good health.  He will be approximately thirty-four years old when he is released from prison.  Although he did not finish high school, Arias completed a certificate program in machine processing.  He was employed at the time of his arrest and reported an income of $640 per month.  The PSI concluded that he should be able to secure employment upon his release from incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the circumstances, we find that the district court acted well within its discretion in imposing a $100 fine and the costs of supervised release.   See United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 620 (1st Cir. 1993) (imposition of fine under the guidelines is reviewed for abuse of discretion).  The fact that the district court imposed only a nominal fine and did not require Arias to pay government costs during incarceration reflects an appreciation by the court of appellant's financial status.   See, e.g., United States v. Pilgrim Mkt. Corp., 944 F.2d 14, 23 (1st Cir. 1991).  Should the appellant be unable to pay even this minimal amount, and should the government seek to incarcerate him for nonpayment, appellant would have ample administrative remedies at his disposal.   See, e.g., United States v. Levy, 897 F.2d 596, 598 (1st Cir. 1990);   Santiago v. United States, 889 F.2d 371, 373-74 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam);   see also United States v.

Sec. 5861(d), and a charge of possession of a weapon by a convicted felon, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1).  At sentencing, the district court applied the cross-reference provision of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and set appellant's base offense level at 28, based on the applicable guideline for attempted murder.  See U.S.S.G. Secs. 2X1.1, 2A2.1.  Arias challenges his sentence, claiming that the district court improperly applied the cross-reference provision.  Arias also appeals from the imposition of a fine and the cost of supervised release.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take the relevant facts from the pre-sentence investigation report (PSI) and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.

On November 15, 1992, at approximately 11:15 p.m., appellant attempted to enter La Frangancia Nightclub in Providence.  Harry Van Leuven and Bienvenido Marrero were working a security detail there.  The owner of the nightclub asked Van Leuven to remove appellant from the premises because he had caused trouble there in the past.  Van Leuven did so, assisted by Marrero.  Before departing, appellant said that he would come back and kill Van Leuven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately fifteen minutes later, appellant returned with a loaded sawed-off shot gun and entered the nightclub.  He pointed the shotgun at Van Leuven.  Marrero grabbed the barrel of the shotgun and jerked it up towards the ceiling.  The shotgun fired, blowing a hole in the ceiling.  Continuing to hold the shotgun, Marrero pushed appellant outside the club and into the street.  There, appellant struggled over the gun with Van Leuven and Marrero.  The shotgun discharged again, hitting no one.  Shortly thereafter, Van Leuven and Marrero subdued appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Arias pled guilty on February 16, 1993, the PSI was prepared.  The report concluded that the base offense level should be set at 28, pursuant to the cross-reference provision of Sec. 2K2.1, because appellant used the shotgun in connection with the offense of attempted murder.  Appellant objected to this application of the guidelines, contending that the cross-referenced offense should be aggravated assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSI determined the fine range to be $10,000 to $100,000 pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 5E1.2(c)(3).  With respect to appellant's ability to pay a fine, the PSI concluded that \"[b]ased upon the defendant's financial profile, it appears that he would have little ability to pay a fine.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The report further stated, however, that \"[Arias] should be capable of securing employment upon his release.\"  Appellant objected to the \"insinuation\" that he would be able to pay the costs of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court adopted the factual findings and guideline application in the PSI.
