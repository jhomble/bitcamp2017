That situation occurs\n\nwhere  the principal  wage-earner  in a  two-parent household\n\nbecomes unemployed, and the  household includes both at least\n\none child common  to the two parents  and at least  one child\n\nwho   is  the  stepchild  of  the   principal  earner.    The\n\nstepchild[ren] of the principal earner receive AFDC, pursuant\n\nto  42 U.S.C.   606(a), because they are deprived of parental\n\nsupport due to the continuous absence from the home, death or\n\nincapacity  of a parent.3   Prior to the  unemployment of the\n\n                    \n\n2.  42 U.S.C.   607(b)(1)(B)(iv) provides,\n\n     for  the  reduction of  the  aid  to families  with\n     dependent  children otherwise payable  to any child\n     or relative  specified  in subsection  (a) of  this\n     section   by  the   amount   of  any   unemployment\n     compensation that such child's parent  described in\n     subparagraph (A)(i) receives under  an unemployment\n     compensation law of a State or of the United States\n     . . . [.]\n\n3.  42 U.S.C.   606(a) provides:\n\n     The term \"dependent child\"  means a needy child (1)\n     who has  been deprived of parental  support or care\n     by reason of the  death, continued absence from the\n     home  (other  than  absence  occasioned  solely  by\n     reason  of the  performance of  active duty  in the\n     uniformed  services  of  the  United   States),  or\n     physical or mental incapacity  of a parent, and who\n     is  living with  his  father, mother,  grandfather,\n     grandmother,    brother,     sister,    stepfather,\n     stepmother,  stepbrother, stepsister,  uncle, aunt,\n     first  cousin,  nephew, or  niece,  in  a place  of\n     residence  maintained   by  one  or  more  of  such\n     relatives  as his or their own home, and (2) who is\n     (A) under the age of eighteen, or (B) at the option\n     of the State, under the age of nineteen and a full-\n     time  student  in a  secondary  school  (or in  the\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nprincipal  earner,  neither  the  principal  earner  nor  the\n\nchild[ren]  common to both parents are included in the family\n\nfiling unit.  \n\n          Pursuant  to HHS/DHS  policy and  regulations, once\n\nthe principal  earner becomes  unemployed, the family  filing\n\nrule requires  that the  principal earner and  the child[ren]\n\ncommon to both  parents be  included in the  filing unit,  as\n\nwell.4    Such  inclusion is required  because the child[ren]\n\nare considered  dependent under  a separate provision  of the\n\nstatute, 42 U.S.C.    607(a), due to the unemployment  of the\n\n                    \n\n     equivalent   level   of  vocational   or  technical\n     training),  if, before he  attains age nineteen, he\n     may reasonably be expected  to complete the program\n     of such secondary school (or such training)[.]\n\n4.  The  Secretary's interpretation of the family filing rule\nhas been embodied in regulations  and official transmissions.\nSee 45  C.F.R.    206.10(a)(1)(vii) which provides,  in part,\n   \nthat,\n\n     in  order  for  the   family  to  be  eligible,  an\n     application with respect to  a dependent child must\n     also include,  if living in the  same household and\n     otherwise eligible for assistance:\n\n     (A)  Any natural or  adoptive parent, or stepparent\n     (in  the  case  of  States  with  laws  of  general\n     applicability); and\n\n     (B)   Any  blood-related  or  adoptive  brother  or\n     sister.\n     . . .\n\nSee also  SSA Transmittal 86-1 at 9  (Jan. 12, 1986) (on two-\n        \nstep process  whereby application of family  filing rule must\nprecede determination of need).\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nparent  who  is  the principal  earner.5    According to  the\n\nSecretary's interpretation  of  the family  filing rule,  the\n\ncommon child[ren] now meet \"the conditions described in . . .\n\n  607(a).\"  42 U.S.C.   602(a)(38).   \n\n          In   the  case   of  the   plaintiff   class,6  the\n\nunemployment compensation received by the principal earner is\n\nthen  subtracted from the AFDC  benefit payable to the newly-\n\ncomposed  family  filing  unit.    Pursuant  to 45  C.F.R.   \n\n233.20(a)(3)(ii)  (B),  unemployment   compensation  is   not\n\nconsidered as income and does not figure into the calculation\n\nof  need, but  is deducted  from the  AFDC payment  after the\n\n                    \n\n5.  42 U.S.C.   607(a) provides:\n\n     The term \"dependent  child\" shall,  notwithstanding\n     section 606(a) of this title, include a needy child\n     who meets the requirements of section 606(a)(2)  of\n     this  title,  who  has been  deprived  of  parental\n     support or  care by reason of  the unemployment (as\n     determined in accordance with  standards prescribed\n     by  the  Secretary)  of   the  parent  who  is  the\n     principal earner, and who is living with any of the\n     relatives  specified in  section 606(a)(1)  of this\n     title in a place of residence maintained by one  or\n     more of such relatives as his (or their) home. \n\n6.  The class was certified as follows:\n\n     All  households  in  the  State of  Maine  who  are\n     recipients  of AFDC  benefits  as  of November  16,\n     1990, or  who will  apply for  AFDC benefits  on or\n     after  November  16,  1990,  and   whose  household\n     composition  includes at  least two adults  and two\n     children where at least  one child is the child  of\n     one but not both of the adults in the household and\n     at least one child  is the child of both  adults in\n     the household  and where the  adult who is  not the\n     parent of  the  first child  receives  unemployment\n     benefits.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\namount of that payment  has been established.7   This special\n\ntreatment of  unemployment  compensation is  the  Secretary's\n\ninterpretation   and   implementation    of   42   U.S.C.    \n\n607(b)(1)(B)(iv).    The  practical  result  of  the  HHS/DHS\n\npolicies is a reduction of the AFDC payment going to families\n\nin the plaintiff class.8  \n\n                    \n\n7.  45 C.F.R.   233.20(a)(3)(ii)(B) provides:\n\n     In determining financial eligibility and the amount\n     of  the assistance  payment  all  remaining  income\n     (except  unemployment  compensation received  by an\n     unemployed principal earner) and, except  for AFDC,\n     all  resources may  be  considered  in relation  to\n     either  the State's  need  standard or  the State's\n     payment   standard.     Unemployment   compensation\n     received by an unemployed principal earner shall be\n     considered only by  subtracting it from the  amount\n     of  the assistance  payment after  the  payment has\n     been determined under the State's payment method[.]\n\n8.  The  operation of  these policies  can be  illustrated by\ntaking the case of one of the plaintiffs, Deborah Blake.  Ms.\nBlake and  her husband live  with their  mutual child,  Shawn\nBlake,  and  Ms. Blake's  two  children,  James and  Courtney\nMorton.  While  Mr. Blake was  employed, the family  received\nAFDC for Ms. Blake's children, James and Courtney Morton, who\nmet the definition of dependent children provided in   606(a)\nof  the  statute.   At  that  time,  the  family filing  rule\nrequired  that    the   two  dependent  children,  James  and\nCourtney, and  their parent,  Ms. Blake,  be included  in the\nfiling  unit.   The  rule did  not  require the  inclusion of\neither Shawn Blake, because he was not considered a dependent\nchild, or  Mr. Blake,  because he  was not  the parent  of an\nAFDC-eligible child.   A portion of  Mr. Blake's income  was,\nhowever, deemed available to the filing unit, pursuant to the\nstepparent deeming  rule, explained infra Part  I, Section A.\n                                         \nBefore  the unemployment  of Mr.  Blake, the  family received\n$453.00  each month in AFDC,  and Mr. Blake  earned $697.00 a\nmonth.\n    Once Mr. Blake became  unemployed, the family filing rule\nrequired the  inclusion  of  both  Shawn (who  then  met  the\ndefinition  of a dependent child in   607(a)) and his parent,\nMr. Blake.  Because  unemployment compensation is disregarded\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          Plaintiffs  brought  this action  against defendant\n\nRollin Ives,  Commissioner of  the Maine Department  of Human\n\nServices,  arguing  that  the  State  was  violating  federal\n\nstatutory   standards  in  determining  the  amount  of  AFDC\n\npayments  going  to members  of their  class.   Ives  filed a\n\nthird-party  complaint against  Louis Sullivan,  Secretary of\n\nthe United  States Department  of Health and  Human Services.\n\nThe case went to the district court on a stipulated record. \n\n          In a memorandum decision, the district  court ruled\n\nin  favor of the plaintiffs  on the grounds  that the HHS/DHS\n\ninterpretations of both  the family filing rule, 42  U.S.C.  \n\n602(a)(38),   and   the   provision  regarding   unemployment\n\ncompensation,  42  U.S.C.    607(b)(1)(B)(iv),  impermissibly\n\nconflicted  with  the plain  meaning  of  the statute.    See\n                                                             \n\nSkidgel  v. Ives,  No. 90-0209-B,  slip op.  (D. Me.  Jan. 2,\n                \n\n1992) [hereinafter Memorandum Decision].  The  district court\n\nread the family filing rule to require  that children defined\n\nas dependent under   607(a) be determined financially \"needy\"\n\nbefore they could be included in the filing unit.  See id. at\n                                                         \n\n                    \n\nin  the determination of need,  the new filing unit initially\nmet the criteria for the maximum AFDC payment for a family of\nfive,  $685.00.    Pursuant  to  regulations  interpreting   \n607(b)(1)(B) (iv),  the State  then subtracted the  amount of\nunemployment  compensation received  by  Mr. Blake,  $498.80,\nfrom the maximum  AFDC payment  of $685.00, to  arrive at  an\nAFDC  payment  of  $186.00.    Although the  total  level  of\ngovernment income going to the family increased following Mr.\nBlake's    unemployment,    the   AFDC    payment   decreased\nconsiderably.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n7.      The   district   court   also   determined   that    \n\n607(b)(1)(B)(iv),  by  its  express  terms,  applies only  to\n\nchildren eligible under   607(a), and does not reach children\n\neligible under   606(a).   See id. at 4-5.  On  March 23, the\n                                 \n\ncourt issued  a final  judgment enjoining the  enforcement of\n\nthe implicated HHS/DHS policies and regulations.  See Skidgel\n                                                             \n\nv. Ives, No.  90-0209-B-H, slip  op. (D. Me.  Mar. 23,  1992)\n       \n\n(final judgment).\n\n          Plaintiffs/appellees urge us to affirm the district\n\ncourt's  decision.    Defendants/appellants  argue  that  the\n\ndistrict  court's   reading  of   42   U.S.C.      602(a)(38)\n\ncontravenes  the  very purpose  of  the  rule, and  draws  an\n\nartificial distinction between   606(a) children and   607(a)\n\nchildren.   As  a  result of  the  district court's  holding,\n\nnon-needy  children who  meet the  definition of  a dependent\n\nchild provided  in  607(a)  are not compulsorily  included in\n\nthe family filing unit.   By contrast, the weight  of federal\n\nauthority requires non-needy children who meet the definition\n\nof a dependent child  provided in   606(a) to be so included.\n\nSee discussion infra Part II,  Section A 3.  With respect  to\n                    \n\nthe  district court's  reading of    607(b)(1)(B)(iv),  it is\n\ndefendants'  position  that  the  court  failed  to  consider\n\ntextual  ambiguity and ultimately  neglected to reconcile its\n\nreading with the family filing rule, 42 U.S.C.    602(a)(38).\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nFor the reasons that  follow, we reverse the decision  of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                              I.\n              Statutory and Regulatory Scheme  \n              Statutory and Regulatory Scheme\n                                             \n\n          AFDC   is   a  cooperative   federal-state  program\n\nauthorized  by Title  IV-A  of the  Social  Security Act,  42\n\nU.S.C.     601  et seq.     The  AFDC  program  provides cash\n                      \n\nassistance to certain needy families with dependent children.\n\nThe program  is administered by the states in accordance with\n\nthe Social Security Act and the regulations and directives of\n\nthe Secretary of  HHS.  We begin with a  brief explanation of\n\nthe implicated statutory provisions  and the regulations  and\n\npolicies which implement them. \n\nA.   Determination of Financial Need\n                                    \n\n          In   addition   to   meeting    other   eligibility\n\nrequirements,  families  receiving AFDC  must  be financially\n\nneedy.   The  main statutory  provision covering  need is  42\n\nU.S.C.     602(a)(7),  which  provides  guidelines  to  state\n\nagencies for  assessing the  resources available to  a family\n\nunit.  In the paragraph which follows, 42 U.S.C.   602(a)(8),\n\nCongress sets forth  criteria for certain income  that may be\n\ndisregarded in the determination of need.  The family  filing\n\nrule, 42  U.S.C.    602(a)(38),  establishes the  individuals\n\nwhose  resources must  be considered  in determining  need in\n\naccordance with 42 U.S.C.    602(a)(7) and (8).  \n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          Financial  eligibility is determined by comparing a\n\nfamily unit's countable income (i.e., income  remaining after\n\ndisregards allowed by law) to the standard of need adopted by\n\nthe  State.   The  standard of  need  is \"the  amount  deemed\n\nnecessary by the State to maintain a hypothetical family at a\n\nsubsistence level.\"   Shea v.  Vialpando, 416  U.S. 251,  253\n                                        \n\n(1974).   States assign a  standard according to  the size of\n\nthe unit applying for AFDC.  In 1990 in Maine the standard of\n\nneed for  a family of four  was $819.00.  An  AFDC payment in\n\nMaine is calculated by  subtracting a family unit's countable\n\nincome,  other than  unemployment compensation received  by a\n\nprincipal earner,  from the standard of  need established for\n\nthe relevant family size.  States are not, however,  required\n\nto  provide  families with  the full  standard  of need.   In\n\nMaine, the maximum AFDC payment is a fixed percentage (69.4%)\n\nof the standard  of need.  Maine permits families to fill the\n\n\"gap\"  between  the need  standard  and  the maximum  payment\n\nstandard  without penalty.    In other  words, families  with\n\ncountable income below the need standard, but above the level\n\nof payment paid by  the State, may still receive  the maximum\n\npayment from the State.  This gap has practical ramifications\n\nin  the  instant  case  because  of  the  operation  of   the\n\nstepparent deeming rule, codified  at 42 U.S.C.   602(a)(31).\n\nIn the case of the plaintiff class, prior to the unemployment\n\nof the  principal  earner  the family  filing  unit  did  not\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\ninclude either the principal  earner or the half-siblings who\n\nwere  not then  dependent children  for  the purposes  of the\n\nstatute.   See  42 U.S.C.    602(a)(38).   A  portion of  the\n              \n\nstepparent's income was,  however, \"deemed\" available  to the\n\nunit, pursuant to the  stepparent deeming rule.  For  many in\n\nthe plaintiff class, the  income deemed available fell within\n\nthe  gap permitted by the  State, so that  when the principal\n\nearners were employed, the AFDC benefit to  the unit eligible\n\nunder   606(a) either was not affected or was only marginally\n\naffected by the deemed income. \n\n B.  Unemployment Compensation and   607 \n                                        \n\n          The   current  AFDC   statute   provides  for   two\n\ncategories  of  \"dependent  children\":  those  defined  in   \n\n606(a), who are deprived due to the continuous absence, death\n\nor incapacity of a parent, and those defined in   607(a), who\n\nare deprived due to the unemployment of the parent who is the\n\nprincipal earner.  As originally enacted, AFDC was limited to\n\nthe category of children defined in   606(a).  In the 1960's,\n\nCongress expanded  the program  to include children  deprived\n\nbecause  of  a parent's  unemployment.    At  that time,  the\n\nso-called AFDC-UP program  (unemployed parent, earlier called\n\nAFDC-UF, for  unemployed father) was available  only to those\n\nfamilies who  were not receiving unemployment  benefits.  See\n                                                             \n\nPhilbrook  v.  Glodgett,  421  U.S.  707,  711  (1975).    In\n                       \n\nPhilbrook,  the  Supreme  Court  decided,  in  essence,  that\n         \n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nparents had  the choice  of applying either  for unemployment\n\ncompensation or  for AFDC.  See  id. at 719.   In response to\n                                   \n\nthe  Philbrook  decision,  Congress  amended  the  statute to\n              \n\nassure  that  unemployed   parents  would  seek   and  obtain\n\nunemployment compensation first, and that AFDC payments would\n\nbe  used  only  to  \"supplement  UC  benefits  up to  AFDC-UF\n\nlevels.\"  See H.R. CONF. REP. NO. 1745, 94th Cong., 2d  Sess.\n             \n\n28 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5997, 6048-49.  The\n                       \n\n1976  amendment  was  the   predecessor  to  the  current    \n\n607(b)(1)(B)(iii)  and  (iv).   See  Pub.  L.  No. 94-566,   \n                                   \n\n507(a)(2), 90  Stat. 2688  (1976) (originally codified  at 42\n\nU.S.C.    607(b)(2)(C) and (D) (1976)).\n\nC.   The Family Filing Rule\n                           \n\n          Prior to 1984, families  applying for AFDC lawfully\n\ncould  choose to  exclude household  members from  the filing\n\nunit if  those members  had resources  that would reduce  the\n\nfamily's  benefit or make the family ineligible for AFDC.  In\n\n1983,  the  Secretary  of  HHS  proposed  an  amendment  \"`to\n\nestablish uniform rules on  the family members who  must file\n\ntogether for AFDC, and the situations in which income must be\n\ncounted.'\"    Bowen v.  Gillard,  483  U.S. 587,  592  (1986)\n                               \n\n(citing  Letter of 25 May 1983, to the Honorable George Bush,\n\nPresident of the Senate).   As part of the  Deficit Reduction\n\nAct of  1984, Pub. L.  No. 98-369, (DEFRA),  Congress amended\n\nthe AFDC program by adopting the  family filing rule.  See 98\n                                                          \n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nStat.  1145  (1984)(codified,  as  amended, at  42  U.S.C.   \n\n602(a)(38)).  The legislative purpose behind the enactment of\n\nthe rule, as reported by the Senate Finance Committee, was as\n\nfollows:                           \n\n                        \"`Present Law\n\n     \"`There is  no requirement in the  present law that\n     parents and  all siblings  be included in  the AFDC\n     filing unit.  Families  applying for assistance may\n     exclude from the filing unit certain family members\n     who  have  income  which  might reduce  the  family\n     benefit.   For  example, a  family might  choose to\n     exclude a child who is receiving social security or\n     child  support  payments,  if  the  payments  would\n     reduce the  family's benefits by  an amount greater\n     than  the amount  payable on  behalf of  the child.\n     . . .\n\n                   \"`Explanation of Provision\n\n     \"`The provision approved by the Committee would    \n     require States to include in the filing unit the\n     parents and all dependent minor siblings (except SSI\n     recipients and any stepbrothers and stepsisters)\n     living with a child who applies for or receives AFDC\n     . . . .\n\n     \"`This change will end the present practice whereby\n     families exclude members with income in order to\n     maximize family benefits, and will ensure that the\n     income of the family members who live together and\n     share expenses is recognized and counted as\n     available to the family as a whole.'\" \n\nBowen,  483 U.S. at 593-94 (quoting from S. Print No. 98-169,\n     \n\n980  (1984)).   Thus,  the  amendment  sought to  compel  the\n\ninclusion  in the  family filing  unit of  dependent children\n\nliving in the same home as the child receiving AFDC.  When it\n\nwas  enacted,  the  family  filing  rule  required  only  the\n\ninclusion of    606(a)  children, children who  were deprived\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\ndue  to  the continuous  absence,  incapacity or  death  of a\n\nparent.   As part  of the  Tax Reform Act  of 1986,  Congress\n\namended     602(a)(38)  to  include  children  who  meet  the\n\nconditions described in    607(a).  See 100 Stat.  2085, 2917\n                                       \n\n(1986)  (  1883(b)(2)(A)  of the  Act).   Under a  subsection\n\nentitled, \"Technical  Corrections to  AFDC and  Child Support\n\nPrograms,\"  the  Senate  Report  accompanying  the  amendment\n\nexplained that no  distinction between children deprived  due\n\nto  the absence, incapacity or  death of a  parent, and those\n\ndeprived due to the  unemployment of a parent,  was intended.\n\nS.

The Family Filing Rule\n                           \n\n                    \n\n9.  The Senate Report provides, in part, that,\n\n     no  such distinction  between these  two categories\n     was intended, and this provision will clarify that,\n     in a State that  provides AFDC on the basis  of the\n     unemployment   of  a   parent,  siblings   who  are\n     dependent for  that reason must be  included in the\n     AFDC unit. \nId.\n   \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n          1.  Background\n                        \n\n          We  begin  by  addressing  the  application of  the\n\nfamily filing rule, 42 U.S.C.    602(a)(38), to the plaintiff\n\nclass.    The rule provides that in making the determinations\n\nof  need  with respect  to  a  dependent child,  states  must\n\ninclude  any parent of a  dependent child and  any brother or\n\nsister  if  such  brother  or sister  \"meets  the  conditions\n\ndescribed  in clauses  (1) and  (2) of  section 606(a)  or in\n\nsection  607(a).\"  Id.    Plaintiffs  challenge  the  State's\n                     \n\npractice of including the child common to both parents in the\n\nfamily   filing   unit   because,   under   the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretation, the child meets the conditions described in  \n\n607(a).   We  must  determine  what  Congress meant  when  it\n\nreferred  to  the  \"conditions  described\" in     607(a);  in\n\nparticular, whether Congress intended to  incorporate need as\n\na condition that must be met  before a child may be  included\n\nin the filing unit.  Although several courts have interpreted\n\nthe family  filing rule with  respect to children  defined as\n\ndependent  under    606(a), the  rule as  originally enacted,\n\nnone  has specifically interpreted the rule with respect to  \n\n607(a) children.  See discussion infra Part II, Section A 3.\n                                      \n\n          The district court held that the family filing rule\n\nrequires the inclusion of children who meet the definition of\n\ndependent found in    607(a) only if such children  are first\n\ndetermined  to be needy.   In so holding,  the district court\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nrecognized the abundance  of federal authority requiring  the\n\ninclusion  of  children  defined  as dependent  in     606(a)\n\nwithout such a  prior determination of need.   See Memorandum\n                                                  \n\nDecision  at  7  n.11.    The  district  court's  reason  for\n\ndistinguishing between these categories of  children centered\n\non the  placement  of  the  word \"needy\"  in  the  respective\n\nsections of  606(a)  and  607(a).   Both  sections  begin  by\n\nstating that \"the term `dependent child' means a needy child\"\n\nwho  meets  certain  conditions.   42  U.S.C.      606(a) and\n\n607(a).  The essence of the  district court's distinction was\n\nthat, because the word \"needy\" appears before clauses (1) and\n\n(2) in    606(a),10 it is not to be  considered in making the\n\ndetermination  under   606 (a) for the reason that the family\n\nfiling unit rule  refers only to the  conditions specified in\n\nthose clauses.   In   607  (a), by contrast,  the word  needy\n\nappears within the  section which is not broken into numbered\n\nclauses,  and  the family  filing  rule  simply references   \n\n607(a).11  The  placement of  the word \"needy\"  was the  sole\n\nbasis  for  what the  district court  found  to be  the plain\n\nmeaning of the rule. \n\n                    \n\n10.  See  supra note  3.   The  statute  begins, \"[t]he  term\n               \n`dependent  child'  means  a  needy child  (1)  who  has been\ndeprived of parental support . . . [.]\"\n\n11.  See  supra note  5.   Section 607(a)  has no  demarcated\n               \nclauses, and  simply  begins, \"[t]he  term `dependent  child'\nshall, notwithstanding section 606(a)  of this title, include\na needy child who has been deprived of parental support . . .\n.\"\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\n          Our inquiry does not end with  the placement of the\n\nword \"needy\"  in    607(a) of  the statute.   We examine  the\n\nfamily  filing  rule  in the  context  of  its  place in  the\n\nstatutory  scheme and in light of its statutory purpose.

See Chevron\n                                                             \n\nU.S.A., Inc.  v.

Ambiguity\n                        \n\n          The district court assumed  that Congress meant the\n\nterm \"conditions  described\" to incorporate all  of the terms\n\nlisted in  the cross-referenced section, 607(a),  and thus to\n\ninclude the term \"needy.\"  Although the  term \"needy\" plainly\n\nappears in    607(a),  it does  not  necessarily follow  that\n\nCongress intended for that term to be a \"condition described\"\n\nfor the purpose of   602(a)(38).  Section 607(a) and   606(a)\n\nfunction in the statutory scheme to define the two categories\n\nof  \"dependent  children\"  who  may  be  eligible  for  AFDC.\n\nRegardless of which categorical  definition is used, no child\n\nor family may  receive AFDC  unless that child  or family  is\n\nfinancially needy.   The family filing  rule has a  different\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nfunction in the statutory  scheme; that of defining  the unit\n\npursuant  to which need  is be determined  under   602(a)(7).\n\nThis function is apparent  from the plain terms of  the rule,\n\nitself,  which  begins: \"in  making  the determination  under\n\nparagraph (7) . . . a State agency shall include . . . .\"  As\n\ndiscussed supra in Part  I Section A, need for  AFDC purposes\n               \n\nis not a fixed condition; its assessment depends on a variety\n\nof factors.  To assume that Congress intended to include need\n\namong  the  \"conditions described\"  for  the  purpose of  the\n\nfamily filing  rule--which, by its plain  terms, exists prior\n\nto the assessment  of need and as a basis  for the definition\n\nof need--is not the most sensible reading of the rule.  \n\n          We find that it is  not clear from the face  of the\n\nrule which conditions  Congress intended to include   when it\n\nreferred to the \"conditions described\" in   607(a).  While in\n\nthe abstract,  it  might  be reasonable  to  presume  that  a\n\nreference to the \"conditions described\" in a cross-referenced\n\nsection  refers to  all descriptive  terms contained  in that\n\nsection, such a reading  is problematic in this context.   By\n\nincluding \"needy\" as a  \"condition[] described,\" the district\n\ncourt's  interpretation does  not properly  account for,  and\n\nreads circularity into, the facially-evident  function of the\n\nfamily filing rule. \n\n          3.   Case Law and Legislative History\n                                               \n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\n          Our examination of  the case  law interpreting  the\n\nfamily filing rule as originally enacted, and the legislative\n\nhistory  behind Congress'  amendment  of the  rule  to add   \n\n607(a),  leads  us  to  conclude that  the  district  court's\n\ninterpretation  is erroneous  and to  uphold  the Secretary's\n\npolicy.         \n\n          Part of  examining the language in  context entails\n\nreviewing  the  case law  which  has  interpreted the  family\n\nfiling  rule to  compel the  inclusion of  non-needy children\n\ndefined as dependent under    606(a).  Overwhelmingly, courts\n\nhave  rejected the argument that a child must be needy before\n\nthat child is to be included  in the family filing unit.  See\n                                                             \n\nGorrie v. Bowen, 809 F.2d  508, 513-16 (8th Cir. 1987).   See\n                                                             \n\nalso  Bradley v. Austin, 841 F.2d 1288, 1294 (6th Cir. 1988);\n                       \n\nCreaton  v.  Bowen, 826  F.2d 6  (9th  Cir. 1987);  Oliver v.\n                                                          \n\nLedbetter, 821 F.2d 1507, 1513 (11th Cir. 1987).  The Supreme\n         \n\nCourt,  in  a case  upholding  the  constitutionality of  the\n\nfamily  filing rule,  dismissed the  argument in  a footnote,\n\nciting  to clear  legislative  intent  to  include  non-needy\n\nchildren in the family filing  unit.  See Bowen, 483 U.S.  at\n                                               \n\n593 n.5.   The Court  commented that construing  the rule  to\n\nrequire the inclusion of  only needy children was \"completely\n\ninconsistent with the intent of  Congress as explained in the\n\nSecretary's request for legislation, in the Senate Print, and\n\nin the Conference Report as well.\"  Id.

See Bowen, 483 U.S. at 587 n.5. \n                           \n\n          The  express purpose  behind the  enactment of  the\n\nfamily  filing   rule,  as  apparent  in   the  Senate  Print\n\nreferenced by the Supreme Court and cited and discussed supra\n                                                             \n\nin  Part I,  Section C,  was to  change the  practice whereby\n\nfamilies  could exclude  children  who had  other  resources,\n\ni.e.,  children who  were not  independently needy,  from the\n\nfamily filing unit. See  Bowen, 483 U.S. at 599  (noting that\n                              \n\nthe purpose of the rule is to \"deny [] a family the right  to\n\nexclude  a supported  child  from the  filing  unit\").   This\n\nlegislative history formed  the cornerstone  of the  district\n\ncourt's  reading of  the family  filing rule  to  require the\n\ninclusion of non-needy children in  Gillard, 633 F. Supp.  at\n                                           \n\n1546. \n\n          It  is true that in Gorrie, the other case cited by\n                                    \n\nthe Supreme Court,  the court  began with the  language of   \n\n606(a) and  was initially persuaded  by the placement  of the\n\nword \"needy\" outside the numbered clauses.  The court did not\n\nrest its conclusion solely on this reading, however, but went\n\non to do a detailed, contextual analysis of the family filing\n\nrule.    The  detailed  analysis  corroborated  that  court's\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\ninitial  reading of the rule to require the inclusion of non-\n\nneedy  children in the family  filing unit.   See Gorrie, 809\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 513-16.   \n\n          Unlike the  court in Gorrie, the  district court in\n                                     \n\nthe instant case stopped with its  reading of   607(a).   The\n\ncourt did not go  on to consider the particular  meaning that\n\nterm might have  in the  context of the  family filing  rule.\n\nHad  the  district  court  continued to  perform  a  detailed\n\nanalysis,  it  would  have  discovered  that the  legislative\n\npurpose  of  the  rule, and  its  function  in the  statutory\n\nscheme, were not  served by  its reading.   Like the  Supreme\n\nCourt, we conclude that the  real problem with construing the\n\nrule to  require the exclusion of non-needy  children is that\n\nsuch a construction flies in the face of Congressional intent\n\nto end the practice of excluding non-needy children  from the\n\nfiling unit.  We  are not persuaded by the  truncated reading\n\nof  the district court,  but proceed to  address the district\n\ncourt's correct concern that    607(a) is drafted differently\n\nfrom   606(a).  \n\n          The  word  \"needy\" appears  in     607(a), and  the\n\nfamily filing rule references the entire section, whereas the\n\n\"needy\"  is offset  in    606(a) and  the family  filing rule\n\nrefers  to  clauses  that do  not  contain  that  term.   The\n\nquestion is what effect to give to that difference, given the\n\nfunction of the  rule in the  statutory scheme, its  purpose,\n\n                             -22-\n                              22\n\nand the  manner in which  the rule has been  interpreted.  In\n\nother  words, was Congress'  cross-reference to a previously-\n\ndrafted section of the statute in which the criterion of need\n\nis not set  off in a  separate clause but appears  within the\n\nreferenced section, a  clear signal of its  intent to include\n\nneed as one  of the  \"conditions described\" as  applied to   \n\n607(a) children?  We do not think so.    \n\n          First,  to  the  extent   that  the  issue  is  the\n\nexclusion of non-needy children  from the family filing unit,\n\nthe same analysis of legislative purpose used with respect to\n\n  606(a) children  applies to  this case.   Moreover, in  the\n\npreviously-  cited   Senate  Print  accompanying   the  DEFRA\n\namendment, the Congress made clear who the exceptions to  the\n\nfamily filing rule were  to be.  Namely, the  provision would\n\nrequire the inclusion of  all dependent minor children except\n\nSSI recipients and  stepchildren.  See  Bowen, supra Part  I,\n                                                    \n\nSection  C (citing S. Print  No. 98-169 at  980).  Otherwise,\n\nthe family filing unit  rule was intended to be  an inclusive\n\nrule, inclusive especially of non-needy siblings.  \n\n          Second,  the  Congressional   history  behind   the\n\namendment  of 42  U.S.C.    602(a)(38),  to include  children\n\neligible  under    607(a), unambiguously  expresses Congress'\n\nintention not to distinguish between children  eligible under\n\nthe two sections.  See S. REP.  NO. 313 at 1074, supra note 9\n                                                      \n\nand accompanying text.   Congress, having omitted a reference\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nto   607(a)  children in  the original rule,  stated that  it\n\nintended  to  create  no  such  distinction between  children\n\neligible under   606(a) and children eligible under   607(a).\n\nThat   Congress  labeled   the   amendment   a   \"[t]echnical\n\n[c]orrection[]\"  further  underscores  its intention  against\n\nsubstantively  different  treatment  of these  categories  of\n\nchildren.  In  sum, we ascertain no basis  for a finding that\n\nCongress intended to treat these categories of  children in a\n\nsubstantively different  manner, permitting the  exclusion of\n\nnon-needy children  eligible under    607(a), but  compelling\n\nthe inclusion of such children eligible under   606(a).12 \n\n          In overturning the finding  of the district  court,\n\nwe note that  this matter of  statutory construction is  made\n\ndifficult by the  patchwork manner in which  the AFDC statute\n\nhas  been enacted.   We deal  with a  statute, and  a section\n\nwithin  a statute,  which  has been  amended frequently,  and\n\nwhich is not rewritten in  its entirety with each  amendment.\n\n                    \n\n12.  Plaintiffs note that the  legislative history of the Tax\nReform Act, which amended the family filing rule to include  \n607(a)  children,  refers  to   the  required  inclusion   of\ndependent  children.     From  Congress'  use   of  the  word\ndependent, plaintiffs conclude that Congress meant to require\nthe  inclusion  of  only  needy      607(a)  children.    The\nlegislative history of the  DEFRA amendment which created the\noriginal family  filing  rule  covering     606(a)  children,\nhowever,  similarly  refers  to  the compelled  inclusion  of\ndependent  children.   As  we have  explained, the  compelled\ninclusion  of    606(a)  children  has been  upheld  by other\nfederal  courts.   Plaintiffs' argument,  without more,  does\nnothing to advance  a reasonable basis for treating    607(a)\nchildren differently from   606(a) children.  \n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\nAs we observed  in Sweeney v. Murray, 732 F.2d 1022, 1024-25,\n                                    \n\n1027(1st Cir. 1984), with regard to a different subsection of\n\nthe  AFDC statute,  the provision  at issue  in this  case is\n\nanything but elegantly drafted, but its legislative directive\n\nis comparatively clear.  We  hold that the Secretary's policy\n\nof requiring the inclusion of non-needy   607(a)  children in\n\nthe filing unit resonates with the legislative purpose of the\n\nrule and upholds its integrity in the statutory scheme.    \n\nB.  The Reduction of AFDC by Unemployment Compensation\n                                                      \n\n          The final  issue is  more difficult.   The district\n\ncourt  held  that  the  HHS/DHS  practice  of  reducing  AFDC\n\npayments  by the  amount  of  the  stepparents'  unemployment\n\nconflicted   with  the   plain   meaning  of   42  U.S.C.    \n\n607(b)(1)(B)(iv).   Once again,  the district  court anchored\n\nits conclusion in what it characterized as plain meaning, and\n\nended  its  inquiry there.    The  court  determined  that   \n\n607(b)(1)(B)(iv) authorized the reduction only of the  income\n\n\"`payable  to  [a]  child .  .  .  specified  in [ 607(a)].'\"\n\nMemorandum Decision at 5.  Thus, only the AFDC payments going\n\nto children eligible under    607(a) would be reduced  by the\n\nunemployment compensation received by the principal earner.  \n\n          Defendants point to two problems  with the district\n\ncourt's  interpretation.    First,  the  court  ignored  that\n\n  607(b)(1)(B)(iv)  of  the   statute  actually  compels  the\n\nreduction  of the AFDC payment  otherwise payable to \"a child\n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\nor  relative  specified\" in    607(a).   The  word \"relative\"\n            \n\ncreates an ambiguity in the statute which the court failed to\n\napprehend.   Second,  once  this language  is  placed in  the\n\ncontext of the larger  statutory scheme, the district court's\n\nreading  cannot be  reconciled with  the family  filing rule.\n\nFor the  reasons that follow,  we conclude that  deference to\n\nthe Secretary is proper in this instance.    \n\n          We first examine the meaning of the word \"relative\"\n\nin   607(b)(1)(B)(iv).   That section directs attention to  a\n\nchild  or relative  specified  in    607(a).   Turning  to   \n\n607(a), one  sees that  the  reference encompasses  relatives\n\nspecified in    606(a)(1) -- a  \"father, mother, grandfather,\n\ngrandmother,   brother,   sister,   stepfather,   stepmother,\n\nstepbrother,  stepsister, uncle, aunt,  first cousin, nephew,\n\nor  niece.\"   42 U.S.C.    606(a).   Defendants argue  that a\n\nplausible interpretation  of    607(b)(1)(B)(iv)  is that  it\n\ndirects the deduction of unemployment compensation from  AFDC\n\npayable  to any   607(a) child, or to any listed, co-resident\n\nrelative of that child.   Plaintiffs offer a  strong contrary\n\nargument  that  the  relatives  listed  in     606(a)(1)  are\n\nintended  to represent  only the  caretaker relatives  of the\n\ndependent   child.     Whether   for   the   purposes  of    \n\n607(b)(1)(B)(iv),  Congress  meant  to  provide  a   list  of\n\nco-resident relatives or to  limit its reference to caretaker\n\nrelatives is,  arguably, ambiguous.   As we  explained supra,\n                                                            \n\n                             -26-\n                              26\n\nwhen we find  ambiguity we give  deference to the  considered\n\ninterpretation of the Secretary.  See Evans, 933 F.2d at 7.\n                                           \n\n          Even were we to  agree with plaintiffs' argument as\n\nto  the  meaning  of  the  word  \"relative,\"  we  would still\n\nencounter  the  problem  of conflict  with  the later-enacted\n\nfamily filing rule when we place   607(B)(1)(B)(iv)  into the\n\ncontext of the statutory scheme.  As we have held, the family\n\nfiling  rule  applies  to     607(a)  children.     The  rule\n\nestablishes a  uniform system  whereby need is  calculated on\n\nthe basis of the collective needs of the household.  Adopting\n\nthe plaintiffs'  reading of   607(b)(1)(B)(iv)  would lead to\n\nthe anomalous  practice of  assessing need collectively,  and\n\nthen splintering the family unit at the point of  determining\n\nthe  proper  AFDC  payment.   To  assess  need  based on  one\n\npicture,  and  arrive  at   benefits  based  on  another,  is\n\nunworkable and undercuts the  policy behind the family filing\n\nrule.  See Bowen, supra Part I Section C (citing S. Print No.\n                       \n\n98-169  at 980) (noting  that one purpose  of the rule  is to\n\n\"ensure that the income of family  members that live together\n\nand share expenses is recognized and counted available to the\n\nfamily as a whole\").                 \n\n          Where  different provisions  of the  same statutory\n\nscheme  are in tension, a  court should make  every effort to\n\nconstrue  such provisions  so as  to achieve  consistency and\n\nharmony.   See Atwell  v. Merit  Systems Protection Bd.,  670\n                                                       \n\n                             -27-\n                              27\n\nF.2d 272,  286 (D.C.

To  the extent that the  issue is one  that has\n\nthe potential  for undermining  the policy behind  the family\n\nfiling rule, we  believe that  the Secretary is  in the  best\n\nposition to resolve the  conflict.  See Chevron, 467  U.S. at\n                                               \n\n844  (1984) (citing  United States  v.

Our  conclusion   is\n\nbuttressed by  the fact  that the  Secretary was  involved in\n\nproposing  and drafting the family filing  rule.  See Gorrie,\n                                                            \n\n809  F.2d  at  514  (noting the  Secretary's  involvement  in\n\nproposing  the legislation  for  the purpose  of establishing\n\nrules about who must file together for AFDC); Bowen, 483 U.S.\n                                                   \n\nat 592, 593  n.5 (same);  St. Luke's Hosp.,  810 F.2d at  331\n                                          \n\n(counseling deference where the  Secretary was present at the\n\nstatute's  creation  and thus  is likely  to  be in  a better\n\nposition to know the intent of the enacting Congress). \n\n          Finally, we  observe,  as did  the district  court,\n\nthat it is not at  all clear that Congress has  addressed the\n\nprecise issue  presented; namely,  the  application of  these\n\n                             -28-\n                              28\n\ndistinct statutory provisions to the  particular situation of\n\nfamilies composed of both   606(a) and   607(a) children.  In\n\nChevron,  the Supreme  Court explained  that in  construing a\n       \n\nstatute  courts  should  first  seek  to  ascertain  \"whether\n\nCongress  has  directly spoken  to  the  precise question  at\n\nissue.\"  Chevron,  467 U.S. at 842.  Although  we do not take\n                \n\nthe  command to mean that Congress must anticipate all of the\n\npossible  scenarios  that might  arise  under  a statute,  we\n\nbelieve  that  this  is a  case  in  which  deference to  the\n\ninterpretation of the Secretary  is especially warranted.  As\n\nwe  explained in  St. Luke's  Hosp., 810  F.2d at  331, \"[a]n\n                                   \n\nimplied delegation  of a law-declaring function is especially\n\nlikely where, as here, the question is interstitial, involves\n\nthe  everyday administration  of the  statute, implicates  no\n\nspecial judicial  expertise, and is unlikely  to affect broad\n\nareas of the  law.\"  Cf. Drysdale  v. Spirito, 689  F.2d 252,\n                                             \n\n261 (1st Cir. 1982) (counseling deference where  the issue is\n\ninterstitial,  and \"imbued  with  administrative history  and\n\ncomplexity\").     \n\n          The factors of ambiguity  in a statute, conflicting\n\nstatutory  provisions, and  a complex,  interstitial question\n\narising  in  the  daily  administration of  the  statute--all\n\ncounsel  deference to  the Secretary.   We  must only  assess\n\nwhether the  Secretary's interpretation is  permissible.   We\n\nfind that the Secretary's policy harmonizes the two statutory\n\n                             -29-\n                              29\n\nprovisions,  while  doing violence  to  neither individually.\n\nThe  Secretary sensibly applies  the family filing  rule.  In\n\nreading     607(b)(1)(B)(iv)  to  require  the  deduction  of\n\nunemployment   compensation  from   the  AFDC   payment,  the\n\nSecretary  reasonably  effectuates  the will  of  Congress to\n\ntreat  AFDC as  a  supplement  to unemployment  compensation,\n\nrather  than  treating  the   two  as  alternative  forms  of\n\nassistance.  \n\n          At   oral   argument,   both  parties   highlighted\n\ninequities resulting from  the respective interpretations  of\n\nthe district  court and  the Secretary.   Under the  district\n\ncourt's  reading,   families  which  contain  both     607(a)\n\nchildren and   606(a) children receive a greater AFDC benefit\n\nthan that received by families who are composed entirely of  \n\n606(a) children or entirely of   607(a) children.  Defendants\n\npointed  out that,  by carving  out two  units,  the district\n\ncourt  effectively permits  one unit  to receive  the maximum\n\npayment  of AFDC,  while the  other one receives  the maximum\n\npayment  of unemployment compensation.  Plaintiffs emphasized\n\nthat under the Secretary's reading, families composed of both\n\n   606(a)  and     607(a) children  receive  less  AFDC  than\n\nfamilies  composed only of    606(a) children.   Once AFDC is\n\ncharacterized  in the  light of  its statutory  purpose as  a\n\nsupplement to  unemployment income, however,  it is  apparent\n\nthat the total  income going to families with both categories\n\n                             -30-\n                              30\n\nof  children is no less than that  going to a   606(a) family\n\ncomposed of the same number of persons.    \n\n          We recognize  the hardship visited  on families  in\n\nthe  plaintiff  class,   whose  life  circumstances   changed\n\ndramatically  following  the  unemployment  of  the principal\n\nearner.  The income  going to the family unit was  reduced by\n\nthe onset of unemployment, and then was further diminished by\n\nreduction of the AFDC payment  in the amount of  unemployment\n\ncompensation  received.   The impact  on the families  in the\n\nplaintiff class of the HHS/DHS policies is exacerbated by the\n\nway in which  Maine treats  the gap between  the standard  of\n\nneed and the maximum AFDC payment.  See discussion supra Part\n                                                        \n\nI, Section  A.  Maine's policy permitted  many families prior\n\nto the  unemployment of  the principal  earner to  attain the\n\nmaximum AFDC  payment because the amount  of countable income\n\nearned by the  principal earner fell within the gap.  See id.\n                                                            \n\nMaine's treatment of the gap, however, generally permits more\n\nfamilies  to live at a  higher level of  subsistence, and has\n\nnot been challenged by the plaintiff class.  \n\n          In the end, we  must acknowledge that the Congress,\n\nHHS and DHS are charged with the difficult task of allocating\n\nlimited funds  across a range of needy  families. Overall, we\n\nbelieve  that the practical  implications of  the Secretary's\n\nreading of the statute,  when viewed allocationally, are more\n\nequitable than  those flowing from the  construction given by\n\n                             -31-\n                              31\n\nthe  district court.  The  decision of the  district court is\n\nReversed.  No costs. \n                   \n\n                             -32-\n                              32\n",

The class was certified as follows:\n\n     All  households  in  the  State of  Maine  who  are\n     recipients  of AFDC  benefits  as  of November  16,\n     1990, or  who will  apply for  AFDC benefits  on or\n     after  November  16,  1990,  and   whose  household\n     composition  includes at  least two adults  and two\n     children where at least  one child is the child  of\n     one but not both of the adults in the household and\n     at least one child  is the child of both  adults in\n     the household  and where the  adult who is  not the\n     parent of  the  first child  receives  unemployment\n     benefits.\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\namount of that payment  has been established.7   This special\n\ntreatment of  unemployment  compensation is  the  Secretary's\n\ninterpretation   and   implementation    of   42   U.S.C.    \n\n607(b)(1)(B)(iv).    The  practical  result  of  the  HHS/DHS\n\npolicies is a reduction of the AFDC payment going to families\n\nin the plaintiff class.8  \n\n                    \n\n7.  45 C.F.R.   233.20(a)(3)(ii)(B) provides:\n\n     In determining financial eligibility and the amount\n     of  the assistance  payment  all  remaining  income\n     (except  unemployment  compensation received  by an\n     unemployed principal earner) and, except  for AFDC,\n     all  resources may  be  considered  in relation  to\n     either  the State's  need  standard or  the State's\n     payment   standard.     Unemployment   compensation\n     received by an unemployed principal earner shall be\n     considered only by  subtracting it from the  amount\n     of  the assistance  payment after  the  payment has\n     been determined under the State's payment method[.]\n\n8.  The  operation of  these policies  can be  illustrated by\ntaking the case of one of the plaintiffs, Deborah Blake.  Ms.\nBlake and  her husband live  with their  mutual child,  Shawn\nBlake,  and  Ms. Blake's  two  children,  James and  Courtney\nMorton.  While  Mr. Blake was  employed, the family  received\nAFDC for Ms. Blake's children, James and Courtney Morton, who\nmet the definition of dependent children provided in   606(a)\nof  the  statute.   At  that  time,  the  family filing  rule\nrequired  that    the   two  dependent  children,  James  and\nCourtney, and  their parent,  Ms. Blake,  be included  in the\nfiling  unit.   The  rule did  not  require the  inclusion of\neither Shawn Blake, because he was not considered a dependent\nchild, or  Mr. Blake,  because he  was not  the parent  of an\nAFDC-eligible child.   A portion of  Mr. Blake's income  was,\nhowever, deemed available to the filing unit, pursuant to the\nstepparent deeming  rule, explained infra Part  I, Section A.\n                                         \nBefore  the unemployment  of Mr.  Blake, the  family received\n$453.00  each month in AFDC,  and Mr. Blake  earned $697.00 a\nmonth.\n    Once Mr. Blake became  unemployed, the family filing rule\nrequired the  inclusion  of  both  Shawn (who  then  met  the\ndefinition  of a dependent child in   607(a)) and his parent,\nMr. Blake.  Because  unemployment compensation is disregarded\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          Plaintiffs  brought  this action  against defendant\n\nRollin Ives,  Commissioner of  the Maine Department  of Human\n\nServices,  arguing  that  the  State  was  violating  federal\n\nstatutory   standards  in  determining  the  amount  of  AFDC\n\npayments  going  to members  of their  class.   Ives  filed a\n\nthird-party  complaint against  Louis Sullivan,  Secretary of\n\nthe United  States Department  of Health and  Human Services.\n\nThe case went to the district court on a stipulated record. \n\n          In a memorandum decision, the district  court ruled\n\nin  favor of the plaintiffs  on the grounds  that the HHS/DHS\n\ninterpretations of both  the family filing rule, 42  U.S.C.  \n\n602(a)(38),   and   the   provision  regarding   unemployment\n\ncompensation,  42  U.S.C.    607(b)(1)(B)(iv),  impermissibly\n\nconflicted  with  the plain  meaning  of  the statute.    See\n                                                             \n\nSkidgel  v. Ives,  No. 90-0209-B,  slip op.  (D. Me.  Jan. 2,\n                \n\n1992) [hereinafter Memorandum Decision].  The  district court\n\nread the family filing rule to require  that children defined\n\nas dependent under   607(a) be determined financially \"needy\"\n\nbefore they could be included in the filing unit.  See id. at\n                                                         \n\n                    \n\nin  the determination of need,  the new filing unit initially\nmet the criteria for the maximum AFDC payment for a family of\nfive,  $685.00.    Pursuant  to  regulations  interpreting   \n607(b)(1)(B) (iv),  the State  then subtracted the  amount of\nunemployment  compensation received  by  Mr. Blake,  $498.80,\nfrom the maximum  AFDC payment  of $685.00, to  arrive at  an\nAFDC  payment  of  $186.00.    Although the  total  level  of\ngovernment income going to the family increased following Mr.\nBlake's    unemployment,    the   AFDC    payment   decreased\nconsiderably.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n7.      The   district   court   also   determined   that    \n\n607(b)(1)(B)(iv),  by  its  express  terms,  applies only  to\n\nchildren eligible under   607(a), and does not reach children\n\neligible under   606(a).   See id. at 4-5.  On  March 23, the\n                                 \n\ncourt issued  a final  judgment enjoining the  enforcement of\n\nthe implicated HHS/DHS policies and regulations.  See Skidgel\n                                                             \n\nv. Ives, No.  90-0209-B-H, slip  op. (D. Me.  Mar. 23,  1992)\n       \n\n(final judgment).\n\n          Plaintiffs/appellees urge us to affirm the district\n\ncourt's  decision.    Defendants/appellants  argue  that  the\n\ndistrict  court's   reading  of   42   U.S.C.      602(a)(38)\n\ncontravenes  the  very purpose  of  the  rule, and  draws  an\n\nartificial distinction between   606(a) children and   607(a)\n\nchildren.   As  a  result of  the  district court's  holding,\n\nnon-needy  children who  meet the  definition of  a dependent\n\nchild provided  in  607(a)  are not compulsorily  included in\n\nthe family filing unit.   By contrast, the weight  of federal\n\nauthority requires non-needy children who meet the definition\n\nof a dependent child  provided in   606(a) to be so included.\n\nSee discussion infra Part II,  Section A 3.  With respect  to\n                    \n\nthe  district court's  reading of    607(b)(1)(B)(iv),  it is\n\ndefendants'  position  that  the  court  failed  to  consider\n\ntextual  ambiguity and ultimately  neglected to reconcile its\n\nreading with the family filing rule, 42 U.S.C.    602(a)(38).\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nFor the reasons that  follow, we reverse the decision  of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                              I.\n              Statutory and Regulatory Scheme  \n              Statutory and Regulatory Scheme\n                                             \n\n          AFDC   is   a  cooperative   federal-state  program\n\nauthorized  by Title  IV-A  of the  Social  Security Act,  42\n\nU.S.C.     601  et seq.     The  AFDC  program  provides cash\n                      \n\nassistance to certain needy families with dependent children.\n\nThe program  is administered by the states in accordance with\n\nthe Social Security Act and the regulations and directives of\n\nthe Secretary of  HHS.  We begin with a  brief explanation of\n\nthe implicated statutory provisions  and the regulations  and\n\npolicies which implement them. \n\nA.   Determination of Financial Need\n                                    \n\n          In   addition   to   meeting    other   eligibility\n\nrequirements,  families  receiving AFDC  must  be financially\n\nneedy.   The  main statutory  provision covering  need is  42\n\nU.S.C.     602(a)(7),  which  provides  guidelines  to  state\n\nagencies for  assessing the  resources available to  a family\n\nunit.  In the paragraph which follows, 42 U.S.C.   602(a)(8),\n\nCongress sets forth  criteria for certain income  that may be\n\ndisregarded in the determination of need.  The family  filing\n\nrule, 42  U.S.C.    602(a)(38),  establishes the  individuals\n\nwhose  resources must  be considered  in determining  need in\n\naccordance with 42 U.S.C.    602(a)(7) and (8).  \n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\n          Financial  eligibility is determined by comparing a\n\nfamily unit's countable income (i.e., income  remaining after\n\ndisregards allowed by law) to the standard of need adopted by\n\nthe  State.   The  standard of  need  is \"the  amount  deemed\n\nnecessary by the State to maintain a hypothetical family at a\n\nsubsistence level.\"   Shea v.  Vialpando, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109010\"><a href=\"/opinion/109010/shea-v-vialpando/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  253\n                                        \n\n(1974).   States assign a  standard according to  the size of\n\nthe unit applying for AFDC.  In 1990 in Maine the standard of\n\nneed for  a family of four  was $819.00.  An  AFDC payment in\n\nMaine is calculated by  subtracting a family unit's countable\n\nincome,  other than  unemployment compensation received  by a\n\nprincipal earner,  from the standard of  need established for\n\nthe relevant family size.  States are not, however,  required\n\nto  provide  families with  the full  standard  of need.   In\n\nMaine, the maximum AFDC payment is a fixed percentage (69.4%)\n\nof the standard  of need.  Maine permits families to fill the\n\n\"gap\"  between  the need  standard  and  the maximum  payment\n\nstandard  without penalty.    In other  words, families  with\n\ncountable income below the need standard, but above the level\n\nof payment paid by  the State, may still receive  the maximum\n\npayment from the State.  This gap has practical ramifications\n\nin  the  instant  case  because  of  the  operation  of   the\n\nstepparent deeming rule, codified  at 42 U.S.C.   602(a)(31).\n\nIn the case of the plaintiff class, prior to the unemployment\n\nof the  principal  earner  the family  filing  unit  did  not\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\ninclude either the principal  earner or the half-siblings who\n\nwere  not then  dependent children  for  the purposes  of the\n\nstatute.   See  42 U.S.C.    602(a)(38).   A  portion of  the\n              \n\nstepparent's income was,  however, \"deemed\" available  to the\n\nunit, pursuant to the  stepparent deeming rule.  For  many in\n\nthe plaintiff class, the  income deemed available fell within\n\nthe  gap permitted by the  State, so that  when the principal\n\nearners were employed, the AFDC benefit to  the unit eligible\n\nunder   606(a) either was not affected or was only marginally\n\naffected by the deemed income. \n\n B.  Unemployment Compensation and   607 \n                                        \n\n          The   current  AFDC   statute   provides  for   two\n\ncategories  of  \"dependent  children\":  those  defined  in   \n\n606(a), who are deprived due to the continuous absence, death\n\nor incapacity of a parent, and those defined in   607(a), who\n\nare deprived due to the unemployment of the parent who is the\n\nprincipal earner.  As originally enacted, AFDC was limited to\n\nthe category of children defined in   606(a).  In the 1960's,\n\nCongress expanded  the program  to include children  deprived\n\nbecause  of  a parent's  unemployment.    At  that time,  the\n\nso-called AFDC-UP program  (unemployed parent, earlier called\n\nAFDC-UF, for  unemployed father) was available  only to those\n\nfamilies who  were not receiving unemployment  benefits.  See\n                                                             \n\nPhilbrook  v.

In\n                       \n\nPhilbrook,  the  Supreme  Court  decided,  in  essence,  that\n         \n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nparents had  the choice  of applying either  for unemployment\n\ncompensation or  for AFDC.  See  id. at 719.   In response to\n                                   \n\nthe  Philbrook  decision,  Congress  amended  the  statute to\n              \n\nassure  that  unemployed   parents  would  seek   and  obtain\n\nunemployment compensation first, and that AFDC payments would\n\nbe  used  only  to  \"supplement  UC  benefits  up to  AFDC-UF\n\nlevels.\"  See H.R.

The\n                       \n\n1976  amendment  was  the   predecessor  to  the  current    \n\n607(b)(1)(B)(iii)  and  (iv).   See  Pub.  L.

The Family Filing Rule\n                           \n\n          Prior to 1984, families  applying for AFDC lawfully\n\ncould  choose to  exclude household  members from  the filing\n\nunit if  those members  had resources  that would reduce  the\n\nfamily's  benefit or make the family ineligible for AFDC.  In\n\n1983,  the  Secretary  of  HHS  proposed  an  amendment  \"`to\n\nestablish uniform rules on  the family members who  must file\n\ntogether for AFDC, and the situations in which income must be\n\ncounted.'\"    Bowen v.  Gillard,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  592  (1986)\n                               \n\n(citing  Letter of 25 May 1983, to the Honorable George Bush,\n\nPresident of the Senate).   As part of the  Deficit Reduction\n\nAct of  1984, Pub. L.  No. 98-369, (DEFRA),  Congress amended\n\nthe AFDC program by adopting the  family filing rule.  See 98\n                                                          \n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nStat.  1145  (1984)(codified,  as  amended, at  42  U.S.C.   \n\n602(a)(38)).  The legislative purpose behind the enactment of\n\nthe rule, as reported by the Senate Finance Committee, was as\n\nfollows:                           \n\n                        \"`Present Law\n\n     \"`There is  no requirement in the  present law that\n     parents and  all siblings  be included in  the AFDC\n     filing unit.  Families  applying for assistance may\n     exclude from the filing unit certain family members\n     who  have  income  which  might reduce  the  family\n     benefit.   For  example, a  family might  choose to\n     exclude a child who is receiving social security or\n     child  support  payments,  if  the  payments  would\n     reduce the  family's benefits by  an amount greater\n     than  the amount  payable on  behalf of  the child.\n     . . .\n\n                   \"`Explanation of Provision\n\n     \"`The provision approved by the Committee would    \n     require States to include in the filing unit the\n     parents and all dependent minor siblings (except SSI\n     recipients and any stepbrothers and stepsisters)\n     living with a child who applies for or receives AFDC\n     . . . .\n\n     \"`This change will end the present practice whereby\n     families exclude members with income in order to\n     maximize family benefits, and will ensure that the\n     income of the family members who live together and\n     share expenses is recognized and counted as\n     available to the family as a whole.'\" \n\nBowen,  483 U.S. at 593-94 (quoting from S. Print No. 98-169,\n     \n\n980  (1984)).   Thus,  the  amendment  sought to  compel  the\n\ninclusion  in the  family filing  unit of  dependent children\n\nliving in the same home as the child receiving AFDC.  When it\n\nwas  enacted,  the  family  filing  rule  required  only  the\n\ninclusion of    606(a)  children, children who  were deprived\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\ndue  to  the continuous  absence,  incapacity or  death  of a\n\nparent.   As part  of the  Tax Reform Act  of 1986,  Congress\n\namended     602(a)(38)  to  include  children  who  meet  the\n\nconditions described in    607(a).  See 100 Stat.  2085, 2917\n                                       \n\n(1986)  (  1883(b)(2)(A)  of the  Act).

The Senate Report provides, in part, that,\n\n     no  such distinction  between these  two categories\n     was intended, and this provision will clarify that,\n     in a State that  provides AFDC on the basis  of the\n     unemployment   of  a   parent,  siblings   who  are\n     dependent for  that reason must be  included in the\n     AFDC unit. \nId.\n   \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\n          1.  Background\n                        \n\n          We  begin  by  addressing  the  application of  the\n\nfamily filing rule, 42 U.S.C.    602(a)(38), to the plaintiff\n\nclass.    The rule provides that in making the determinations\n\nof  need  with respect  to  a  dependent child,  states  must\n\ninclude  any parent of a  dependent child and  any brother or\n\nsister  if  such  brother  or sister  \"meets  the  conditions\n\ndescribed  in clauses  (1) and  (2) of  section 606(a)  or in\n\nsection  607(a).\"  Id.    Plaintiffs  challenge  the  State's\n                     \n\npractice of including the child common to both parents in the\n\nfamily   filing   unit   because,   under   the   Secretary's\n\ninterpretation, the child meets the conditions described in  \n\n607(a).   We  must  determine  what  Congress meant  when  it\n\nreferred  to  the  \"conditions  described\" in     607(a);  in\n\nparticular, whether Congress intended to  incorporate need as\n\na condition that must be met  before a child may be  included\n\nin the filing unit.  Although several courts have interpreted\n\nthe family  filing rule with  respect to children  defined as\n\ndependent  under    606(a), the  rule as  originally enacted,\n\nnone  has specifically interpreted the rule with respect to  \n\n607(a) children.  See discussion infra Part II, Section A 3.\n                                      \n\n          The district court held that the family filing rule\n\nrequires the inclusion of children who meet the definition of\n\ndependent found in    607(a) only if such children  are first\n\ndetermined  to be needy.   In so holding,  the district court\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\nrecognized the abundance  of federal authority requiring  the\n\ninclusion  of  children  defined  as dependent  in     606(a)\n\nwithout such a  prior determination of need.   See Memorandum\n                                                  \n\nDecision  at  7  n.11.    The  district  court's  reason  for\n\ndistinguishing between these categories of  children centered\n\non the  placement  of  the  word \"needy\"  in  the  respective\n\nsections of  606(a)  and  607(a).   Both  sections  begin  by\n\nstating that \"the term `dependent child' means a needy child\"\n\nwho  meets  certain  conditions.   42  U.S.C.      606(a) and\n\n607(a).  The essence of the  district court's distinction was\n\nthat, because the word \"needy\" appears before clauses (1) and\n\n(2) in    606(a),10 it is not to be  considered in making the\n\ndetermination  under   606 (a) for the reason that the family\n\nfiling unit rule  refers only to the  conditions specified in\n\nthose clauses.   In   607  (a), by contrast,  the word  needy\n\nappears within the  section which is not broken into numbered\n\nclauses,  and  the family  filing  rule  simply references   \n\n607(a).11  The  placement of  the word \"needy\"  was the  sole\n\nbasis  for  what the  district court  found  to be  the plain\n\nmeaning of the rule. \n\n                    \n\n10.  See  supra note  3.   The  statute  begins, \"[t]he  term\n               \n`dependent  child'  means  a  needy child  (1)  who  has been\ndeprived of parental support . . . [.]\"\n\n11.  See  supra note  5.   Section 607(a)  has no  demarcated\n               \nclauses, and  simply  begins, \"[t]he  term `dependent  child'\nshall, notwithstanding section 606(a)  of this title, include\na needy child who has been deprived of parental support . . .\n.\"\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\n          Our inquiry does not end with  the placement of the\n\nword \"needy\"  in    607(a) of  the statute.   We examine  the\n\nfamily  filing  rule  in the  context  of  its  place in  the\n\nstatutory  scheme and in light of its statutory purpose.

Ambiguity\n                        \n\n          The district court assumed  that Congress meant the\n\nterm \"conditions  described\" to incorporate all  of the terms\n\nlisted in  the cross-referenced section, 607(a),  and thus to\n\ninclude the term \"needy.\"  Although the  term \"needy\" plainly\n\nappears in    607(a),  it does  not  necessarily follow  that\n\nCongress intended for that term to be a \"condition described\"\n\nfor the purpose of   602(a)(38).  Section 607(a) and   606(a)\n\nfunction in the statutory scheme to define the two categories\n\nof  \"dependent  children\"  who  may  be  eligible  for  AFDC.\n\nRegardless of which categorical  definition is used, no child\n\nor family may  receive AFDC  unless that child  or family  is\n\nfinancially needy.   The family filing  rule has a  different\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\nfunction in the statutory  scheme; that of defining  the unit\n\npursuant  to which need  is be determined  under   602(a)(7).\n\nThis function is apparent  from the plain terms of  the rule,\n\nitself,  which  begins: \"in  making  the determination  under\n\nparagraph (7) . . . a State agency shall include . . . .\"  As\n\ndiscussed supra in Part  I Section A, need for  AFDC purposes\n               \n\nis not a fixed condition; its assessment depends on a variety\n\nof factors.  To assume that Congress intended to include need\n\namong  the  \"conditions described\"  for  the  purpose of  the\n\nfamily filing  rule--which, by its plain  terms, exists prior\n\nto the assessment  of need and as a basis  for the definition\n\nof need--is not the most sensible reading of the rule.  \n\n          We find that it is  not clear from the face  of the\n\nrule which conditions  Congress intended to include   when it\n\nreferred to the \"conditions described\" in   607(a).  While in\n\nthe abstract,  it  might  be reasonable  to  presume  that  a\n\nreference to the \"conditions described\" in a cross-referenced\n\nsection  refers to  all descriptive  terms contained  in that\n\nsection, such a reading  is problematic in this context.   By\n\nincluding \"needy\" as a  \"condition[] described,\" the district\n\ncourt's  interpretation does  not properly  account for,  and\n\nreads circularity into, the facially-evident  function of the\n\nfamily filing rule. \n\n          3.

Overwhelmingly, courts\n\nhave  rejected the argument that a child must be needy before\n\nthat child is to be included  in the family filing unit.

See  Bowen, 483 U.S. at 599  (noting that\n                              \n\nthe purpose of the rule is to \"deny [] a family the right  to\n\nexclude  a supported  child  from the  filing  unit\").   This\n\nlegislative history formed  the cornerstone  of the  district\n\ncourt's  reading of  the family  filing rule  to  require the\n\ninclusion of non-needy children in  Gillard, 633 F. Supp.  at\n                                           \n\n1546. \n\n          It  is true that in Gorrie, the other case cited by\n                                    \n\nthe Supreme Court,  the court  began with the  language of   \n\n606(a) and  was initially persuaded  by the placement  of the\n\nword \"needy\" outside the numbered clauses.  The court did not\n\nrest its conclusion solely on this reading, however, but went\n\non to do a detailed, contextual analysis of the family filing\n\nrule.    The  detailed  analysis  corroborated  that  court's\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\ninitial  reading of the rule to require the inclusion of non-\n\nneedy  children in the family  filing unit.   See Gorrie, 809\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 513-16.   \n\n          Unlike the  court in Gorrie, the  district court in\n                                     \n\nthe instant case stopped with its  reading of   607(a).   The\n\ncourt did not go  on to consider the particular  meaning that\n\nterm might have  in the  context of the  family filing  rule.\n\nHad  the  district  court  continued to  perform  a  detailed\n\nanalysis,  it  would  have  discovered  that the  legislative\n\npurpose  of  the  rule, and  its  function  in the  statutory\n\nscheme, were not  served by  its reading.   Like the  Supreme\n\nCourt, we conclude that the  real problem with construing the\n\nrule to  require the exclusion of non-needy  children is that\n\nsuch a construction flies in the face of Congressional intent\n\nto end the practice of excluding non-needy children  from the\n\nfiling unit.  We  are not persuaded by the  truncated reading\n\nof  the district court,  but proceed to  address the district\n\ncourt's correct concern that    607(a) is drafted differently\n\nfrom   606(a).  \n\n          The  word  \"needy\" appears  in     607(a), and  the\n\nfamily filing rule references the entire section, whereas the\n\n\"needy\"  is offset  in    606(a) and  the family  filing rule\n\nrefers  to  clauses  that do  not  contain  that  term.   The\n\nquestion is what effect to give to that difference, given the\n\nfunction of the  rule in the  statutory scheme, its  purpose,\n\n                             -22-\n                              22\n\nand the  manner in which  the rule has been  interpreted.  In\n\nother  words, was Congress'  cross-reference to a previously-\n\ndrafted section of the statute in which the criterion of need\n\nis not set  off in a  separate clause but appears  within the\n\nreferenced section, a  clear signal of its  intent to include\n\nneed as one  of the  \"conditions described\" as  applied to   \n\n607(a) children?  We do not think so.    \n\n          First,  to  the  extent   that  the  issue  is  the\n\nexclusion of non-needy children  from the family filing unit,\n\nthe same analysis of legislative purpose used with respect to\n\n  606(a) children  applies to  this case.   Moreover, in  the\n\npreviously-  cited   Senate  Print  accompanying   the  DEFRA\n\namendment, the Congress made clear who the exceptions to  the\n\nfamily filing rule were  to be.  Namely, the  provision would\n\nrequire the inclusion of  all dependent minor children except\n\nSSI recipients and  stepchildren.  See  Bowen, supra Part  I,\n                                                    \n\nSection  C (citing S. Print  No. 98-169 at  980).  Otherwise,\n\nthe family filing unit  rule was intended to be  an inclusive\n\nrule, inclusive especially of non-needy siblings.  \n\n          Second,  the  Congressional   history  behind   the\n\namendment  of 42  U.S.C.    602(a)(38),  to include  children\n\neligible  under    607(a), unambiguously  expresses Congress'\n\nintention not to distinguish between children  eligible under\n\nthe two sections.  See S. REP.  NO. 313 at 1074, supra note 9\n                                                      \n\nand accompanying text.   Congress, having omitted a reference\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nto   607(a)  children in  the original rule,  stated that  it\n\nintended  to  create  no  such  distinction between  children\n\neligible under   606(a) and children eligible under   607(a).\n\nThat   Congress  labeled   the   amendment   a   \"[t]echnical\n\n[c]orrection[]\"  further  underscores  its intention  against\n\nsubstantively  different  treatment  of these  categories  of\n\nchildren.  In  sum, we ascertain no basis  for a finding that\n\nCongress intended to treat these categories of  children in a\n\nsubstantively different  manner, permitting the  exclusion of\n\nnon-needy children  eligible under    607(a), but  compelling\n\nthe inclusion of such children eligible under   606(a).12 \n\n          In overturning the finding  of the district  court,\n\nwe note that  this matter of  statutory construction is  made\n\ndifficult by the  patchwork manner in which  the AFDC statute\n\nhas  been enacted.   We deal  with a  statute, and  a section\n\nwithin  a statute,  which  has been  amended frequently,  and\n\nwhich is not rewritten in  its entirety with each  amendment.\n\n                    \n\n12.  Plaintiffs note that the  legislative history of the Tax\nReform Act, which amended the family filing rule to include  \n607(a)  children,  refers  to   the  required  inclusion   of\ndependent  children.     From  Congress'  use   of  the  word\ndependent, plaintiffs conclude that Congress meant to require\nthe  inclusion  of  only  needy      607(a)  children.    The\nlegislative history of the  DEFRA amendment which created the\noriginal family  filing  rule  covering     606(a)  children,\nhowever,  similarly  refers  to  the compelled  inclusion  of\ndependent  children.   As  we have  explained, the  compelled\ninclusion  of    606(a)  children  has been  upheld  by other\nfederal  courts.   Plaintiffs' argument,  without more,  does\nnothing to advance  a reasonable basis for treating    607(a)\nchildren differently from   606(a) children.  \n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\nAs we observed  in Sweeney v. Murray, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"434888\"><a href=\"/opinion/434888/donna-sweeney-v-joseph-j-murray-margaret-heckler-etc-donna-sweeney-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1024-25,\n                                    \n\n1027(1st Cir. 1984), with regard to a different subsection of\n\nthe  AFDC statute,  the provision  at issue  in this  case is\n\nanything but elegantly drafted, but its legislative directive\n\nis comparatively clear.  We  hold that the Secretary's policy\n\nof requiring the inclusion of non-needy   607(a)  children in\n\nthe filing unit resonates with the legislative purpose of the\n\nrule and upholds its integrity in the statutory scheme.    \n\nB.  The Reduction of AFDC by Unemployment Compensation\n                                                      \n\n          The final  issue is  more difficult.   The district\n\ncourt  held  that  the  HHS/DHS  practice  of  reducing  AFDC\n\npayments  by the  amount  of  the  stepparents'  unemployment\n\nconflicted   with  the   plain   meaning  of   42  U.S.C.    \n\n607(b)(1)(B)(iv).   Once again,  the district  court anchored\n\nits conclusion in what it characterized as plain meaning, and\n\nended  its  inquiry there.    The  court  determined  that   \n\n607(b)(1)(B)(iv) authorized the reduction only of the  income\n\n\"`payable  to  [a]  child .  .  .  specified  in [ 607(a)].'\"\n\nMemorandum Decision at 5.  Thus, only the AFDC payments going\n\nto children eligible under    607(a) would be reduced  by the\n\nunemployment compensation received by the principal earner.  \n\n          Defendants point to two problems  with the district\n\ncourt's  interpretation.    First,  the  court  ignored  that\n\n  607(b)(1)(B)(iv)  of  the   statute  actually  compels  the\n\nreduction  of the AFDC payment  otherwise payable to \"a child\n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\nor  relative  specified\" in    607(a).   The  word \"relative\"\n            \n\ncreates an ambiguity in the statute which the court failed to\n\napprehend.   Second,  once  this language  is  placed in  the\n\ncontext of the larger  statutory scheme, the district court's\n\nreading  cannot be  reconciled with  the family  filing rule.\n\nFor the  reasons that follow,  we conclude that  deference to\n\nthe Secretary is proper in this instance.    \n\n          We first examine the meaning of the word \"relative\"\n\nin   607(b)(1)(B)(iv).   That section directs attention to  a\n\nchild  or relative  specified  in    607(a).   Turning  to   \n\n607(a), one  sees that  the  reference encompasses  relatives\n\nspecified in    606(a)(1) -- a  \"father, mother, grandfather,\n\ngrandmother,   brother,   sister,   stepfather,   stepmother,\n\nstepbrother,  stepsister, uncle, aunt,  first cousin, nephew,\n\nor  niece.\"   42 U.S.C.    606(a).   Defendants argue  that a\n\nplausible interpretation  of    607(b)(1)(B)(iv)  is that  it\n\ndirects the deduction of unemployment compensation from  AFDC\n\npayable  to any   607(a) child, or to any listed, co-resident\n\nrelative of that child.   Plaintiffs offer a  strong contrary\n\nargument  that  the  relatives  listed  in     606(a)(1)  are\n\nintended  to represent  only the  caretaker relatives  of the\n\ndependent   child.     Whether   for   the   purposes  of    \n\n607(b)(1)(B)(iv),  Congress  meant  to  provide  a   list  of\n\nco-resident relatives or to  limit its reference to caretaker\n\nrelatives is,  arguably, ambiguous.   As we  explained supra,\n                                                            \n\n                             -26-\n                              26\n\nwhen we find  ambiguity we give  deference to the  considered\n\ninterpretation of the Secretary.  See Evans, 933 F.2d at 7.\n                                           \n\n          Even were we to  agree with plaintiffs' argument as\n\nto  the  meaning  of  the  word  \"relative,\"  we  would still\n\nencounter  the  problem  of conflict  with  the later-enacted\n\nfamily filing rule when we place   607(B)(1)(B)(iv)  into the\n\ncontext of the statutory scheme.  As we have held, the family\n\nfiling  rule  applies  to     607(a)  children.     The  rule\n\nestablishes a  uniform system  whereby need is  calculated on\n\nthe basis of the collective needs of the household.  Adopting\n\nthe plaintiffs'  reading of   607(b)(1)(B)(iv)  would lead to\n\nthe anomalous  practice of  assessing need collectively,  and\n\nthen splintering the family unit at the point of  determining\n\nthe  proper  AFDC  payment.   To  assess  need  based on  one\n\npicture,  and  arrive  at   benefits  based  on  another,  is\n\nunworkable and undercuts the  policy behind the family filing\n\nrule.  See Bowen, supra Part I Section C (citing S. Print No.\n                       \n\n98-169  at 980) (noting  that one purpose  of the rule  is to\n\n\"ensure that the income of family  members that live together\n\nand share expenses is recognized and counted available to the\n\nfamily as a whole\").                 \n\n          Where  different provisions  of the  same statutory\n\nscheme  are in tension, a  court should make  every effort to\n\nconstrue  such provisions  so as  to achieve  consistency and\n\nharmony.   See Atwell  v. Merit  Systems Protection Bd.,  670\n                                                       \n\n                             -27-\n                              </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  286 (D.C.

To  the extent that the  issue is one  that has\n\nthe potential  for undermining  the policy behind  the family\n\nfiling rule, we  believe that  the Secretary is  in the  best\n\nposition to resolve the  conflict.  See Chevron, 467  U.S. at\n                                               \n\n844  (1984) (citing  United States  v. Shimer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106274\"><a href=\"/opinion/106274/united-states-v-shimer/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                             \n\n382, 383 (1961),  for the proposition  that the principle  of\n\ndeference  to  administrative  interpretations   is  followed\n\nwhenever a decision as  to the meaning of a  statute involves\n\nreconciling  conflicting  policies).     Our  conclusion   is\n\nbuttressed by  the fact  that the  Secretary was  involved in\n\nproposing  and drafting the family filing  rule.  See Gorrie,\n                                                            \n\n809  F.2d  at  514  (noting the  Secretary's  involvement  in\n\nproposing  the legislation  for  the purpose  of establishing\n\nrules about who must file together for AFDC); Bowen, 483 U.S.\n                                                   \n\nat 592, 593  n.5 (same);  St. Luke's Hosp.,  810 F.2d at  331\n                                          \n\n(counseling deference where the  Secretary was present at the\n\nstatute's  creation  and thus  is likely  to  be in  a better\n\nposition to know the intent of the enacting Congress). \n\n          Finally, we  observe,  as did  the district  court,\n\nthat it is not at  all clear that Congress has  addressed the\n\nprecise issue  presented; namely,  the  application of  these\n\n                             -28-\n                              28\n\ndistinct statutory provisions to the  particular situation of\n\nfamilies composed of both   606(a) and   607(a) children.  In\n\nChevron,  the Supreme  Court explained  that in  construing a\n       \n\nstatute  courts  should  first  seek  to  ascertain  \"whether\n\nCongress  has  directly spoken  to  the  precise question  at\n\nissue.\"  Chevron,  467 U.S. at 842.  Although  we do not take\n                \n\nthe  command to mean that Congress must anticipate all of the\n\npossible  scenarios  that might  arise  under  a statute,  we\n\nbelieve  that  this  is a  case  in  which  deference to  the\n\ninterpretation of the Secretary  is especially warranted.  As\n\nwe  explained in  St. Luke's  Hosp., 810  F.2d at  331, \"[a]n\n                                   \n\nimplied delegation  of a law-declaring function is especially\n\nlikely where, as here, the question is interstitial, involves\n\nthe  everyday administration  of the  statute, implicates  no\n\nspecial judicial  expertise, and is unlikely  to affect broad\n\nareas of the  law.\"  Cf. Drysdale  v. Spirito, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409207\"><a href=\"/opinion/409207/diane-drysdale-v-thomas-spirito/\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                             \n\n261 (1st Cir. 1982) (counseling deference where  the issue is\n\ninterstitial,  and \"imbued  with  administrative history  and\n\ncomplexity\").     \n\n          The factors of ambiguity  in a statute, conflicting\n\nstatutory  provisions, and  a complex,  interstitial question\n\narising  in  the  daily  administration of  the  statute--all\n\ncounsel  deference to  the Secretary.   We  must only  assess\n\nwhether the  Secretary's interpretation is  permissible.   We\n\nfind that the Secretary's policy harmonizes the two statutory\n\n                             -29-\n                              29\n\nprovisions,  while  doing violence  to  neither individually.\n\nThe  Secretary sensibly applies  the family filing  rule.  In\n\nreading     607(b)(1)(B)(iv)  to  require  the  deduction  of\n\nunemployment   compensation  from   the  AFDC   payment,  the\n\nSecretary  reasonably  effectuates  the will  of  Congress to\n\ntreat  AFDC as  a  supplement  to unemployment  compensation,\n\nrather  than  treating  the   two  as  alternative  forms  of\n\nassistance.  \n\n          At   oral   argument,   both  parties   highlighted\n\ninequities resulting from  the respective interpretations  of\n\nthe district  court and  the Secretary.   Under the  district\n\ncourt's  reading,   families  which  contain  both     607(a)\n\nchildren and   606(a) children receive a greater AFDC benefit\n\nthan that received by families who are composed entirely of  \n\n606(a) children or entirely of   607(a) children.  Defendants\n\npointed  out that,  by carving  out two  units,  the district\n\ncourt  effectively permits  one unit  to receive  the maximum\n\npayment  of AFDC,  while the  other one receives  the maximum\n\npayment  of unemployment compensation.  Plaintiffs emphasized\n\nthat under the Secretary's reading, families composed of both\n\n   606(a)  and     607(a) children  receive  less  AFDC  than\n\nfamilies  composed only of    606(a) children.   Once AFDC is\n\ncharacterized  in the  light of  its statutory  purpose as  a\n\nsupplement to  unemployment income, however,  it is  apparent\n\nthat the total  income going to families with both categories\n\n                             -30-\n                              30\n\nof  children is no less than that  going to a   606(a) family\n\ncomposed of the same number of persons.    \n\n          We recognize  the hardship visited  on families  in\n\nthe  plaintiff  class,   whose  life  circumstances   changed\n\ndramatically  following  the  unemployment  of  the principal\n\nearner.  The income  going to the family unit was  reduced by\n\nthe onset of unemployment, and then was further diminished by\n\nreduction of the AFDC payment  in the amount of  unemployment\n\ncompensation  received.   The impact  on the families  in the\n\nplaintiff class of the HHS/DHS policies is exacerbated by the\n\nway in which  Maine treats  the gap between  the standard  of\n\nneed and the maximum AFDC payment.  See discussion supra Part\n                                                        \n\nI, Section  A.  Maine's policy permitted  many families prior\n\nto the  unemployment of  the principal  earner to  attain the\n\nmaximum AFDC  payment because the amount  of countable income\n\nearned by the  principal earner fell within the gap.  See id.\n                                                            \n\nMaine's treatment of the gap, however, generally permits more\n\nfamilies  to live at a  higher level of  subsistence, and has\n\nnot been challenged by the plaintiff class.  \n\n          In the end, we  must acknowledge that the Congress,\n\nHHS and DHS are charged with the difficult task of allocating\n\nlimited funds  across a range of needy  families. Overall, we\n\nbelieve  that the practical  implications of  the Secretary's\n\nreading of the statute,  when viewed allocationally, are more\n\nequitable than  those flowing from the  construction given by\n\n                             -31-\n                              31\n\nthe  district court.  The  decision of the  district court is\n\nReversed.  No costs. \n                   \n\n                             -32-\n                              32\n</pre>",
