Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f             LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.            Appellant Marc Jadlowe raises\n\nmultiple issues of substance in challenging his conviction on drug\n\nconspiracy     charges.        Most   significantly,       he   argues    that   the\n\ndistrict court committed structural error by instructing the jurors\n\nthat they could discuss the case among themselves during the trial,\n\nbefore     formal    deliberations     commenced.          We   agree     that   the\n\ninstruction was erroneous. We conclude, however, that a showing of\n\nprejudice is necessary to justify a new trial based on premature\n\njury discussions.           As the record here shows beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that the flawed instruction did not compromise the jury's\n\ndeliberative process, Jadlowe is not entitled to a new trial on\n\nthat basis.      We also find no reversible error in the suppression\n\nand evidentiary rulings that Jadlowe disputes. We therefore affirm\n\nthe judgment of conviction.\n\n                                        I.\n\n             In November 2005, a federal grand jury charged Jadlowe\n\nand   fourteen      other    individuals     in   an   eleven-count      indictment\n\nalleging various drug-related crimes.1                 Jadlowe was named in two\n\ncounts, one alleging conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine,\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, and the other alleging possession\n\nand distribution of cocaine on November 4, 2005, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1).            We set forth here the background of the\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          All of Jadlowe's co-defendants pled guilty.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fconspiracy, as depicted by the government at a suppression hearing\n\nand at trial.2\n\n               In      late      September      2005,      the   Drug    Enforcement\n\nAdministration (\"DEA\") initiated a wiretap on the phone of Brandin\n\nGonsalves,          one   of     Jadlowe's     co-defendants,     as    part    of   an\n\ninvestigation into drug trafficking activities in and around New\n\nBedford, Massachusetts.               Within the first week of the wiretap, the\n\nDEA intercepted a call between Gonsalves and another defendant,\n\nJohn       Ferreira,      Jr.,   in   which    the   men   discussed    using   \"Uncle\n\nMar[c]'s\" garage to store a suspected shipment of cocaine.3                          Law\n\nenforcement agents concluded that \"Uncle Marc\" was Jadlowe based\n\non, inter alia, pen register data obtained from Gonsalves's phone\n\nshowing that Gonsalves frequently exchanged calls with a phone\n\nnumber the agents linked to Jadlowe.4\n\n\n       2\n       Jadlowe does not dispute the sequence of events described by\nthe government, but he claims that the government did not prove his\nknowing involvement in a cocaine conspiracy.         He argues in\nparticular that the admissible evidence failed to show that he was\none of the participants in a series of wiretapped phone\nconversations in which the government identified him as a speaker\nor that he was the individual seen on a videotape made by officers\ndoing surveillance at his home.\n       3\n       On October 21, 2005, the government obtained court approval\nfor a second wiretap of Gonsalves's phone and an initial wiretap of\nFerreira's phone.\n       4\n       A \"pen register\" is a device used, inter alia, to record the\ndialing and other information transmitted by a targeted phone. 18\nU.S.C. § 3127(3); see also United States v. Santana, 175 F.3d 57,\n61 n.2 (1st Cir. 1999). DEA Task Force Agent Andrew Simmons\ntestified that a \"pen order\" authorized law enforcement officers\n\"to track who was calling the phone number, what numbers were being\n\n                                              -3-\n\f            On October 5, 2005, DEA agents intercepted a call between\n\nGonsalves   and    Ferreira    at    10:24      p.m.,   and   another   call   from\n\nGonsalves to Jadlowe a minute later, in which the men discussed how\n\nmuch Jadlowe would be paid for the use of his garage to temporarily\n\nstore ten to twenty kilograms of cocaine.               On October 8, Gonsalves\n\nand Jadlowe discussed putting a generator in Jadlowe's house and\n\nrunning an extension cord, apparently to provide light for the\n\nunloading of the cocaine in the garage.5                Although Gonsalves told\n\nJadlowe the drugs were expected to arrive \"in a couple of days,\"\n\na call between Gonsalves and Ferreira on October 21 indicated that\n\nthe delivery had been delayed because the supplier had run into\n\nproblems with law enforcement authorities.6\n\n            On    November    3,    the   DEA    intercepted    a   call   between\n\nFerreira and an unidentified male who reported that \"[m]y plane got\n\ndelayed but, yeah my girl be here early in the morning,\" prompting\n\nagents to set up surveillance for the next day at Jadlowe's home at\n\n\n\n\ncalled, the duration of the call, the time of day of the call, and\nwe would get that real time.\"\n     5\n       Agent Simmons testified that the gas and electricity were\nshut off at Jadlowe's home address during that time period.\n     6\n       In the call, Ferreira told Gonsalves that he had spoken with\n\"Fofado\" and that \"Rudolfo got bagged up by the feds . . .\n[c]rossin' you know.\" Agent Simmons testified that the government\nwas unable to identify Rudolfo or to connect this conversation with\na specific drug seizure.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f30 Arch Street in Dartmouth, Massachusetts.7               Early on November 4,\n\nDEA    Special      Agent    Michael   Barbuti     and   other   law    enforcement\n\nofficers began physical surveillance near Arch Street while Agent\n\nSimmons and his team monitored the Gonsalves and Ferriera wiretaps\n\nfrom another location.              At about 11 a.m., DEA Special Agent\n\nJennifer Fallon began surveillance of 30 Arch Street from an\n\nunmarked police truck that was parked on a street parallel to Arch\n\nStreet, monitoring the scene through a video camera.8\n\n                 Shortly before 2 p.m., the multi-faceted surveillance\n\nbore fruit.        Fallon saw someone enter the garage at 30 Arch Street,\n\nat which point she turned on the camera and began videotaping.                  She\n\nthen       saw   the   man   move   items   from   the    garage   to    the   yard.\n\nMeanwhile, the wiretap was capturing calls between Gonsalves and\n\nJadlowe revealing that Jadlowe was clearing out his garage to make\n\n\n\n\n       7\n       The buildings at 30 Arch Street, which were owned by\nJadlowe's family, consisted at that time of an unoccupied house,\nstill under construction, that was attached to the garage at the\nfront of the property and a separate residence behind that\nstructure (identified as 30R Arch Street).     Jadlowe's driver's\nlicense and vehicle registration both listed 30 Arch Street as his\naddress.\n       8\n       Fallon was the only agent with a direct view of 30 Arch\nStreet, but she testified that she \"was just looking at a screen\ninside the truck,\" not out any windows.     Other officers would\noccasionally drive by the house, but Barbuti explained at the\nsuppression hearing that they could not park within sight of the\nhouse because \"[i]t's a very residential area with no sidewalks,\nand vehicles that would be parked there would be easily\nrecognized.\"\n\n                                         -5-\n\froom for a truck.9    About an hour later, Jadlowe called Ferreira\n\nand told him the garage was \"all set\" – the doors were unlocked,\n\nand the back window was open to let in light.   As agents watched,\n\nJadlowe then left the garage and drove away.\n\n          At about 3:45 p.m., agents saw a white truck enter\n\nJadlowe's garage.    At 3:53 p.m., Ferriera called Jadlowe and said\n\nthat \"they\" were over at his house, in the garage, \"right now\" and\n\nhad been there for ten minutes, but that there were \"no lights over\n\nthere.\"   Jadlowe instructed Ferreira to tell them to remove paper\n\nthat was covering the door as a way to allow in more light.     At\n\napproximately 4:16 p.m., Ferreira reported to Jadlowe that \"them\n\ncats are putting the truck back together.   They're out of there.\"\n\nAt about 4:30 p.m., agents saw the truck leave the garage and drive\n\naway and, a minute later, Jadlowe called Ferreira to report that he\n\nhad seen the truck leaving his street.   The two men agreed to meet\n\nat 30 Arch Street.    Jadlowe was seen on the video arriving at his\n\nresidence a few minutes later, and in a series of three recorded\n\nconversations at about 4:40 p.m., Ferreira asked Jadlowe if he\n\ncould \"see them things there . . . [r]ight above the window behind\n\nthe insulation.\"10   The men were still on the phone as Ferreira\n\n\n     9\n       In the first call, at 1:56 p.m., Jadlowe reported that he\nwas \"[t]aking care of the garage.\"      At 2:40 p.m., he told\nGonsalves: \"You should be able to fit the truck in here no\nproblems.\"\n     10\n       Simmons testified that much of the communication between the\nconspirators in this case was conducted by using phones as \"Direct\n\n                                 -6-\n\farrived at 30 Arch Street, at which point he told Jadlowe that he\n\ndid not want \"them things just bring the phone.\"     Ferreira and\n\nJadlowe were seen driving off together at about 4:50 p.m.\n\n          Meanwhile, after being alerted by phone, Massachusetts\n\nState Trooper Stephen Fortin had stopped the white truck for a\n\nlicense plate violation a short distance from 30 Arch Street.\n\nOfficers observed Ferreira drive past the truck and patrol car,\n\nand Simmons testified that contemporaneous phone calls Ferreira\n\nmade to Gonsalves and a man named \"Snack\" revealed that the men\n\nwere \"in somewhat of a panic\" about the truck's detention and the\n\n\"need[] to move the stuff\" from Jadlowe's garage.\n\n          At approximately 5:30 p.m., Agent Fallon saw a car pull\n\ninto the driveway of 30 Arch Street and, with the car's headlights\n\nshining into the garage, an individual entered the building. Agent\n\nBarbuti and his team arrived soon thereafter, and he and another\n\nofficer encountered Jadlowe coming out a door from the garage.\n\nJadlowe was arrested, pat-frisked and handcuffed, and a cell phone\n\nwas taken from him.11   Agents then entered the garage, where they\n\nsaw in plain view ten brick-shaped packages that turned out to be\n\nkilogram amounts of cocaine stacked atop a pile of drywall toward\n\n\nConnect\" devices, a mode in which they functioned like walkie-\ntalkies. When the phones were used that way, a new \"session\" was\nrecorded each time a change in speaker occurred.\n     11\n       There is a disagreement between the parties about whether\nthe record shows that the phone was seized in the frisk. See infra\nSection IIB.\n\n                                -7-\n\fthe rear of the garage.      Several agents remained in the garage\n\novernight while Agent Simmons obtained a search warrant for the\n\nproperty.   At about 11 a.m. the next day, November 5, 2005, agents\n\nexecuted a warrant for Jadlowe's garage and the two houses at 30\n\nand 30R Arch Street.    They seized the ten packages of cocaine from\n\nthe garage and other items, including phone records, from the\n\nhouses.\n\n            Following his indictment on the two drug trafficking\n\ncharges, Jadlowe filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized on\n\nNovember 4 and 5. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court\n\ndenied suppression of the cocaine and the cell phone,12 but granted\n\nhis motion to suppress the evidence seized from the two houses.13\n\nA five-day jury trial concluded on July 7, 2008, with findings of\n\nguilt on both counts.   Jadlowe was sentenced to 120-month terms of\n\nimprisonment on each count, to run concurrently, followed by five\n\nyears of supervised release.\n\n            On appeal, Jadlowe renews his argument that the cocaine\n\nand cell phone should have been suppressed because they were\n\nproducts of the officers' unlawful entry and overnight stay in his\n\ngarage, and he argues that the court also should have suppressed\n\n\n     12\n       The court found that the phone was seized from Jadlowe's\nperson at the time of his arrest.\n     13\n       The government had in fact conceded that the items found in\nthe houses must be suppressed because the affidavit filed in\nsupport of the search warrant application established probable\ncause to search only the garage.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fphone records that he claims were linked to documents found during\n\nthe unlawful search of his home.            He also raises a host of\n\nevidentiary arguments: (1) the court should have excluded an\n\nexhibit containing a list of incoming and outgoing wiretapped calls\n\nbecause that list consisted of inadmissible hearsay; (2) the court\n\nerred in allowing Agent Fallon to give lay opinion testimony\n\nidentifying Jadlowe in the November 4 videotape; (3) the court erred\n\nin allowing Agent Simmons to identify Jadlowe's voice in wiretapped\n\nphone conversations; and (4) the court erred in allowing the jury\n\nto   view   transcripts   of   wiretapped   phone   conversations   that\n\nidentified Jadlowe as one of the speakers.            Finally, Jadlowe\n\nasserts that a new trial is required because the district court\n\nvirtually invited the jury to engage in premature deliberations\n\nwhen it instructed the jurors that, as the trial progressed, they\n\ncould talk about \"interesting things that happened during the\n\ncourse of the trial, . . . interesting things witnesses say,\n\nsignificant pieces of evidence.\"\n\n            We begin our discussion with the court's suppression\n\nrulings.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            Jadlowe challenges the district court's denial of his\n\npretrial motion to suppress the cocaine and cell phone found at 30\n\nArch Street, as well as the court's ruling at trial allowing the\n\ngovernment to introduce records that he claims were the tainted\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f\"fruit\" of the illegal search of his houses.               In evaluating the\n\ndenial of a suppression motion, we review the district court's\n\nfindings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Larios, 593 F.3d 82, 92 (1st Cir. 2010).               As the\n\nissues differ with respect to each of the three challenged items of\n\nevidence, we address them separately.\n\nA. The Cocaine\n\n           The    government   concedes       on   appeal    that     the   law\n\nenforcement officers initially saw the ten bricks of cocaine during\n\nan unlawful entry into Jadlowe's garage. The officers did not have\n\na search warrant, and the government accepts the district court's\n\nimplicit finding that the entry was not justified by exigent\n\ncircumstances.    Noting the distinction \"between the securing of a\n\npremises   from   its   perimeter,    which   does   not    require    exigent\n\ncircumstances, and the impounding of a premises by occupying it\n\nfrom the inside, which does,\" see United States v. Dessesaure, 429\n\nF.3d 359, 370 (1st Cir. 2005),14 the court pointed out that 30 Arch\n\nStreet was under \"close physical surveillance\" on November 4 and\n\nthat the only realistic risk that the cocaine would be moved or\n\n\n\n\n     14\n       We noted in Dessesaure that some police officers \"may have\nmistakenly believed that they were free, absent a search warrant or\nexigent circumstances, to enter a dwelling in order to 'freeze' the\nscene.\" 429 F.3d at 370.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthat any other evidence would be destroyed was eliminated by\n\nJadlowe's arrest.15\n\n                The court went on to conclude, however, that the cocaine\n\nwas nonetheless admissible at trial under the principles set out in\n\nSegura v. United States, 468 U.S. 796 (1984), and its progeny.                     In\n\nSegura, the Court held that an illegal entry to secure a premises\n\ndid not preclude admission of evidence found during a later search\n\nof the same location pursuant to a warrant drawn from sources\n\n\"wholly    unconnected      with    the      [illegal]     entry.\"    Id.   at   814.\n\nAlthough the evidence at issue in Segura had been discovered for\n\nthe first time during the second, untainted search, the Court in\n\nMurray     v.    United   States,      487    U.S.   533    (1988),   extended    the\n\n\"independent source\" doctrine to \"evidence that had been observed\n\nin plain view at the time of a prior illegal entry,\" id. at 535.\n\nThe   Court      stated   that   the    question     in    such   circumstances   is\n\n\"whether the search pursuant to warrant was in fact a genuinely\n\nindependent source of the information and tangible evidence at\n\nissue.\"     Id. at 542.      That would not be so, the Court explained,\n\n\"if the agents' decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what\n\nthey had seen during the initial entry, or if information obtained\n\n\n\n      15\n        In light of those circumstances, the court also rejected\napplicability of the \"'protective sweep' rule\" of Maryland v. Buie,\n494 U.S. 325 (1990), which allows officers to conduct a warrantless\n\"sweep\" of a premises following an arrest based on a reasonable\nbelief \"that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a\ndanger to those on the arrest scene.\" Id. at 337.\n\n                                          -11-\n\fduring that entry was presented to the Magistrate and affected his\n\ndecision to issue the warrant.\"            Id.\n\n            In Dessesaure, 429 F.3d at 367-69, we adopted a two-part\n\ninquiry to implement Murray's holding.                    In determining whether\n\nevidence discovered in a lawful search pursuant to a warrant may be\n\nadmissible in the aftermath of an unlawful entry, we consider: (1)\n\nwhether    the     search      warrant    affidavit        contained    sufficient\n\ninformation to support probable cause without any information\n\ngleaned from the unlawful search; and (2) whether the decision to\n\nseek the warrant was in fact \"'independent of the illegal entry,'\"\n\ni.e., \"'whether it would have been sought even if what actually\n\nhappened had not occurred.'\"            Id. (quoting Murray, 487 U.S. at 542\n\nn.3); see also United States v. Siciliano, 578 F.3d 61, 68 (1st\n\nCir. 2009) (noting that, \"under the independent source doctrine,\n\n'evidence acquired by an untainted search which is identical to\n\n. . . evidence unlawfully acquired' is admissible\" (quoting Murray,\n\n487 U.S. at 538)).\n\n            Jadlowe concedes that the officers had probable cause to\n\nsearch    the    garage   even   before    they     saw    the   cocaine,   and    he\n\ntherefore contests only prong two, i.e., the district court's\n\nconclusion      that   the    agents'    decision    to     seek   a   warrant    was\n\nindependent of the illegal entry.           The police officers' subjective\n\nintent to seek a warrant is a factual determination subject to\n\nclear error review.          Siciliano, 578 F.3d at 69.\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\f            The district court explained its ruling on that issue as\n\nfollows:\n\n            Here, there can be no doubt but that a warrant\n            would have been sought even had the agents not\n            observed the packages of cocaine in the\n            garage. Too much evidence had been gathered\n            and too much corroborating conduct on the part\n            of the defendants had been observed for agents\n            to simply take the chance that what was\n            delivered . . . to the garage at 30 Arch\n            Street was some innocent commodity.\n\nJadlowe    argues    that   the   record    does     not   support   the   court's\n\nfinding.     He     acknowledges     that    Agent    Simmons,   the   lead    law\n\nenforcement officer in the investigation, testified that he would\n\nhave sought a warrant even had the officers not seen the bricks of\n\ncocaine in the garage.            Jadlowe claims, however, that Simmons'\n\nassertion is belied by the officer's earlier testimony that the\n\noperational plan called for seizing the cocaine in a motor vehicle\n\nstop after Gonsalves or Ferreira retrieved the drugs from the\n\ngarage.16 He emphasizes the absence of direct evidence that, at the\n\ntime they entered the garage, the agents intended to obtain a\n\nwarrant and cites cases in which such contemporaneous evidence was\n\n\n     16\n        At the suppression hearing in September 2007, Simmons\ntestified as follows:\n\n          The plan at that time was, if the cocaine was\n     unloaded at that address, it was anticipated that either\n     Mr. Gonsalves or Mr. Ferreira would go to that address to\n     retrieve the cocaine. At that point, once they retrieved\n     the cocaine to move it to another location, we were going\n     to do a motor vehicle stop of their vehicle in order to\n     obtain the cocaine.\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fpresent.   See, e.g., United States v. Walton, 56 F.3d 551, 554 (4th\n\nCir. 1995) (noting that agents had been preparing the search\n\nwarrant affidavit for several days before an unlawful garage\n\nentry); United States v. Ford, 22 F.3d 374, 378 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(noting that, prior to unlawful entry, police had told defendant of\n\nintent to obtain a warrant).\n\n           As an initial matter, we agree that Simmons's statement\n\nof his subjective intent is not necessarily dispositive.        See\n\nMurray, 487 U.S. at 540 n.2; Dessesaure, 429 F.3d at 369.    We can\n\nalso accept Jadlowe's assertion that the officers had neither begun\n\nthe process of securing a warrant nor even formed the intent to\n\nobtain one before the quickly developing events of November 4\n\nunfolded contrary to their plans.17    Our cases, however, reject as\n\n\"too rigid\" the requirement that the officers be actively pursuing\n\na warrant at the time of the unlawful entry, United States v.\n\nSilvestri, 787 F.2d 736, 746 (1st Cir. 1986), and favor instead a\n\n\"flexible standard\" based on \"[t]he specific facts of each case,\"\n\nFord, 22 F.3d at 377.18   \"[T]here is no necessary requirement that\n\n\n     17\n        At trial, in July 2008, Simmons testified that the plan\nconceived the night of November 3 was to \"allow the delivery to\ntake place, secure the address into which it was brought to, and\nthen apply for a warrant that day.\" We assume, in Jadlowe's favor,\nthat the intent to secure a warrant did not develop until the next\nday.\n     18\n       Silvestri and Ford both involved the \"inevitable discovery\"\ndoctrine rather than the \"independent source\" doctrine, but we have\nrecognized that the two doctrines are \"close relative[s],\"\nSiciliano, 578 F.3d at 68 n.4. The inevitable discovery doctrine\n\n                                -14-\n\fthe warrant application process have already been initiated at the\n\ntime the illegal search took place.\"   Silvestri, 787 F.2d at 746.\n\n          Here, we discern no clear error in the district court's\n\nfinding that the circumstances as a whole left \"no doubt\" that the\n\nofficers would have sought a warrant – as they eventually did –\n\nonce they realized that they needed to enter the garage to gain\n\npossession of the drugs.   The record permitted the district court\n\nto find that the officers had not applied for a warrant earlier\n\nbecause they expected to arrest one or more of the conspirators and\n\nseize the drugs in a vehicle stop. Although the officers' strategy\n\nchanged as the events of November 4 unfolded, their testimony\n\nreflects an assumption that cocaine would be – and then was –\n\ndelivered to Jadlowe's garage.    Simmons testified that when the\n\nwiretaps revealed the conspirators' intent to move the cocaine from\n\nthe garage to a different, less accessible location, the officers\n\ndetermined that they might need to take action at 30 Arch Street.\n\nBarbuti's testimony similarly reflects a belief that there was\n\n\n\napplies when the evidence at issue was not later obtained\nindependently, but it \"'inevitably would have been discovered by\nlawful means.'\" Id. (quoting Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 444\n(1984)).   The Supreme Court similarly has observed that \"[t]he\ninevitable discovery doctrine . . . is in reality an extrapolation\nfrom the independent source doctrine: Since the tainted evidence\nwould be admissible if in fact discovered through an independent\nsource, it should be admissible if it inevitably would have been\ndiscovered.\" Murray, 487 U.S. at 539. The flexibility we apply in\nthe inevitable discovery context is at least as appropriate where\nthe evidence was subsequently obtained by lawful, independent\nmeans.\n\n                               -15-\n\fcocaine in the garage: \"We formulated a plan that we did not want\n\nto allow the kilograms to leave that area for fear of losing them\n\nor having them be moved to a location where we weren't able to\n\nsurveil.\"    The district court thus reasonably found that, well\n\nbefore the officers saw the cocaine, they resolved not to \"take the\n\nchance that what was delivered . . . to the garage at 30 Arch\n\nStreet was some innocent commodity.\"\n\n            Jadlowe suggests that excusing the agents' unlawful entry\n\nhere would seriously undermine the Fourth Amendment's warrant\n\nrequirement, allowing officers to \"always choose first to illegally\n\nsearch the premises\" and to forego seeking a warrant when no\n\nevidence is found. The Supreme Court in Murray explicitly rejected\n\nsuch an argument:\n\n            As petitioners see the incentives, law\n            enforcement officers will routinely enter\n            without a warrant to make sure that what they\n            expect to be on the premises is in fact there.\n            If it is not, they will have spared themselves\n            the time and trouble of getting a warrant; if\n            it is, they can get the warrant and use the\n            evidence despite the unlawful entry. We see\n            the incentives differently. An officer with\n            probable cause sufficient to obtain a search\n            warrant would be foolish to enter the premises\n            first in an unlawful manner. By doing so, he\n            would risk suppression of all evidence on the\n            premises, both seen and unseen, since his\n            action would add to the normal burden of\n            convincing a magistrate that there is probable\n            cause the much more onerous burden of\n            convincing a trial court that no information\n            gained from the illegal entry affected either\n            the law enforcement officers' decision to seek\n            a warrant or the magistrate's decision to\n            grant it.     Nor would the officer without\n\n                                 -16-\n\f            sufficient probable cause to obtain a search\n            warrant have any added incentive to conduct an\n            unlawful entry, since whatever he finds cannot\n            be used to establish probable cause before a\n            magistrate.\n\n487 U.S. at 539-40.\n\n            Nor are we persuaded by Jadlowe's attempt to depict this\n\nas the egregious case where suppression is necessary to vindicate\n\nthe principles underlying the exclusionary rule.              In United States\n\nv. Madrid, 152 F.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 1998), the case on which he\n\nprimarily relies, the evidence indicated that, while awaiting a\n\nwarrant, \"officers went upstairs and downstairs [in a residence] on\n\ntwo or three occasions, detained and searched the occupants, seized\n\nwallets and placed them in envelopes marked 'evidence,' and leafed\n\nthrough personal mail and a notebook.\"              Id. at 1040.     Here, by\n\ncontrast,    the   district    court   found    that    the    officers   left\n\nundisturbed the targeted, plain-view evidence, and \"[t]he most that\n\nagents did that might be said to have compromised the crime scene\n\nwas   to    rearrange   some    furniture      to   make   themselves     more\n\ncomfortable.\"19\n\n            In sum, while the district court correctly noted that\n\n\"the more appropriate course would have been to secure the garage\n\nfrom the perimeter,\" it properly applied the independent source\n\n\n      19\n        Jadlowe's counsel elicited testimony from Agent Barbuti\nacknowledging that the officers were responsible for placing a\nwhite plastic chair, a radio, and a bottle of Coca-Cola near the\ncocaine so that they would be \"more comfortable while hanging out\nin the garage.\"\n\n                                   -17-\n\fdoctrine in refusing to suppress the cocaine seized from Jadlowe's\n\ngarage.\n\nB. The Cell Phone\n\n           A cell phone linked with phone number (508) 536-1022\n\n(\"the 1022 phone\") was seized by the agents sometime during the\n\nevents surrounding Jadlowe's arrest at 30 Arch Street on November\n\n4.   Relying on the testimony of Agent Barbuti, the district court\n\nfound that the phone was \"seized from [Jadlowe's] person\" in a\n\nlawful search incident to his arrest.                See United States v.\n\nRobinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235 (1973) (holding that a search incident\n\nto \"[a] custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause\" is\n\nreasonable   under   the      Fourth     Amendment);    United    States    v.\n\nNascimento, 491 F.3d 25, 49 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"Officers effecting an\n\narrest are entitled to make a search incident to that arrest.\").\n\nIn its written ruling on the suppression motion, the court stated\n\nthat Barbuti had testified that Lieutenant Robert Andrade, the\n\narresting officer, \"took the phone from Jadlowe during the search\n\nand handed it to him [Barbuti] for safekeeping.\"\n\n           Jadlowe   points    out     that   the   testimony   presented   by\n\nBarbuti and Andrade differed from the court's description and\n\nargues that, given the actual record, the court clearly erred in\n\nfinding that the seizure of the phone was lawful.           Barbuti in fact\n\ntestified that he was uncertain about who had given him the phone\n\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\for when he had received it,20 and Andrade testified that he had no\n\nmemory of taking the phone from Jadlowe.21                In light of this\n\ntestimony, Jadlowe argues, the government failed to meet its burden\n\nof proving that the phone was seized legally.             See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Lopez, 380 F.3d 538, 543 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting the\n\ngovernment's burden to prove the lawfulness of a search).\n\n           Although the officers' testimony leaves some ambiguity as\n\nto   exactly   when   and   how   Barbuti   acquired     the   phone,   we   are\n\ncomfortable that the district court's finding that it was seized\n\nfrom Jadlowe's person at the time of his arrest was not clearly\n\nerroneous.     See United States v. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (describing the relevant inquiry as \"whether the evidence\n\npresented at the suppression hearing fairly supports the court's\n\nfinding\").      As    the   government   points   out,    Barbuti   testified\n\nunequivocally that he had been told the phone had been taken from\n\nJadlowe's person, and Andrade testified that he knew \"there was a\n\ncell phone at the location.\"       Jadlowe himself represented that the\n\n\n\n      20\n        Barbuti stated: \"At some point, I don't know if it was\n[right after the pat-frisk] or immediately after doing a protective\nsweep of the residence, I was handed the cell phone from Mr.\nJadlowe's person.\" He said he did not remember who handed it to\nhim, but confirmed that it was \"represented to [him] that it had\ncome from Mr. Jadlowe's person.\"\n      21\n        When asked if a cell phone was \"found on Mr. Jadlowe\nsubsequent to your arrest of him,\" Andrade responded: \"I know there\nwas a cell phone at the location. I don't recall it being on Mr.\nJadlowe.\"   He reiterated that reply in response to a follow-up\nquestion: \"I don't recall a cell phone being found on his person.\"\n\n                                     -19-\n\fphone had been on \"his person\" in his motion to suppress (a point\n\nnoted        by   the   district   court).22   Moreover,   the   scope   of   a\n\npermissible search incident to an arrest is not limited to the\n\narrestee's person, but includes \"'the area from within which he\n\nmight gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.'\"\n\nNascimento, 491 F.3d at 49 (quoting Chimel v. California, 395 U.S.\n\n752, 763 (1969)).          There is no evidence that the officers entered\n\neither of the Jadlowe houses before obtaining the warrant, and the\n\nrecord therefore supports the view that the phone was found near\n\nJadlowe, even if not on his person.\n\n                  To succeed in challenging the denial of a suppression\n\nmotion, a defendant \"must show that no reasonable view of the\n\nevidence supports the district court's decision.\" United States v.\n\nDunbar, 553 F.3d 48, 55 (1st Cir. 2009) (quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted); United States v. Larios, 593 F.3d 82, 92 (1st\n\nCir. 2010).         Jadlowe has not made that showing here.\n\nC. The Phone Records\n\n                  At trial, the government introduced, as Exhibit 12,\n\nSprint Nextel phone records that Jadlowe claims should have been\n\nsuppressed because they were the fruit of the government's illegal\n\n\n\n        22\n       In his motion to suppress, Jadlowe stated: \"The defendant\nalso moves to suppress any evidence seized from his person on\nNovember 4th, 2005, including a cell phone.\"      His affidavit in\nsupport of the motion states that, \"[o]n information and belief,\nthe government intends to use evidence seized from the property and\nfrom my person against me at trial.\"\n\n                                        -20-\n\fsearch of his homes on November 5. Exhibit 12 included information\n\nabout     the    1022   phone,    which   was    the    one   seized   incident   to\n\nJadlowe's arrest, and referred to a second phone with the number\n\n(508) 982-1964 (\"the           1964 phone\").      Phone records related to the\n\n1964 phone had been seized from Jadlowe's residence, but the court\n\nsuppressed them in ruling that the search of the homes was not\n\nsupported by probable cause.           Simmons testified, however, that the\n\ngovernment had relied on those improperly seized records concerning\n\nthe 1964 phone when it issued a single subpoena to Sprint for\n\ninformation about the two phone numbers.\n\n                It   appears     undisputed      that   the    government's    only\n\ninformation about the 1964 phone derived from the illegal search\n\nand, hence, no evidence about that phone number should have been\n\nadmitted at trial.         The information in Exhibit 12 about the 1022\n\nphone, however, derived from a court-authorized pen register of\n\nGonsalves's cell phone in August 2005 and, as such, was not a fruit\n\nof the illegal search of Jadlowe's home.23\n\n                Technically,     therefore,      Exhibit      12   contained   both\n\nadmissible and inadmissible evidence, and Jadlowe may be correct\n\nthat the court erred in allowing it into evidence.                     But any such\n\nerror was certainly harmless.              With respect to the 1964 phone,\n\n\n     23\n       The pen register identified a phone with an IMSI number –\nwhich is like a serial number – of 316010102274660. The Sprint\nrecords connected that IMSI number to the 1022 phone and to the\nphone's use as a Direct Connect device with the number\n183*913*2639.\n\n                                          -21-\n\fExhibit 12 says only that \"[n]o records were found . . . during the\n\nrequested time period.\" The bulk of the information on the exhibit\n\nrelates to the 1022 phone.      The document identifies the 1022\n\naccount holder as Marc Souza, whose listed date of birth is the\n\nsame as Jadlowe's.    That section of the document also links the\n\nIMSE number from the pen register with the 1022 phone seized from\n\nJadlowe, thereby linking him with intercepted calls to and from\n\nGonsalves and Ferreira.24   Hence, the damaging information in the\n\nexhibit was all lawfully derived.\n\n           Jadlowe attempts to sidestep this critical dichotomy\n\nbetween the admissible and inadmissible information in Exhibit 12\n\nby arguing that the document implicitly suggests that the two phone\n\nnumbers are linked.   Even if that were true, it would not matter.\n\nThe exhibit in effect said nothing about the 1964 number, there was\n\nno substantive testimony about it, and the government did not rely\n\non it.    We agree with the government that, even if admission of\n\nExhibit 12 were error, it did not influence the verdict and was\n\n\n\n     24\n        Each of the two sections of the document, which are\nseparated by a line of asterisks, begins with a listing of \"Request\nType,\" followed by the explanation \"Subscription Info (Basic).\"\nEach lists a \"Date Range\" and \"Subject Number.\" The top section\nidentifies the number as \"5089821964\" and the bottom section lists\n\"316010102274660\" as the number.      The top section then has a\nlisting for \"Comments,\" which is followed by the \"[n]o records were\nfound\" entry.     The bottom section lists an account number,\nsubscriber name, address, comments (the \"comment\" is that the\naccount was established in June 2005), and a variety of other\ninformation, including the full 1022 phone number and the Direct\nConnect number.\n\n                               -22-\n\ftherefore harmless.          See, e.g., United States v. Hicks, 575 F.3d\n\n130, 143 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                                           III.\n\n              Jadlowe    argues      that     the     district   court    committed\n\nreversible error by telling the jurors that they could discuss the\n\nevidence as the trial progressed, before they commenced formal\n\ndeliberations, so long as they did not express an ultimate opinion\n\nabout the outcome of the case.              Preserved claims of instructional\n\nerror are reviewed under a two-tiered standard: we consider de novo\n\nwhether \"an instruction embodied an error of law,\" but \"we review\n\nfor   abuse    of    discretion      'whether       the   instructions    adequately\n\nexplained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the\n\njury on the controlling issues.'\" United States v. Silva, 554 F.3d\n\n13, 21 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting United States v. Ranney, 298 F.3d\n\n74, 79 (1st Cir. 2002)).\n\n              Ordinarily,     even    if    we    find    instructional    error,   a\n\ndefendant is entitled to a new trial \"only if it had a prejudicial\n\neffect.\"      Bastien v. Goddard, 279 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 2002); see\n\nalso Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a) (\"Any error, defect, irregularity, or\n\nvariance      that    does    not    affect       substantial    rights    must     be\n\ndisregarded.\").         An exception exists for errors that are \"so\n\nintrinsically harmful as to require automatic reversal . . .\n\nwithout regard to their effect on the outcome.\"                   Neder v. United\n\n\n\n\n                                           -23-\n\fStates, 527 U.S. 1, 7 (1999); see also United States v. Brandao,\n\n539 F.3d 44, 58 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nA. Did Instructional Error Occur?\n\n          The   challenged   instruction   was   delivered   before   the\n\nopening statements as part of the court's explanation of how the\n\ncase would proceed:\n\n                 I just have a few special instructions\n          about your conduct as jurors. The first one\n          is the hardest. You are not to discuss the\n          case with each other or anyone else until you\n          retire to the jury room at the end of the case\n          to deliberate on your verdict.\n                 This rule is not as strict as it\n          sounds. When I say you are not to discuss the\n          case, I mean it in this sense. You are not to\n          express an ultimate opinion about the outcome\n          of the case.\n                 Personally, even this rule, the way I\n          state it, I don't think is a terribly good\n          rule. I understand the reason for it. The\n          thought is that because some of us tend to be\n          more opinionated and assertive than others,\n          jurors who are more assertive will tend to\n          influence the opinions of fellow jurors if\n          jurors are talking about the case before they\n          hear all of the evidence. I think this, in\n          fact, underestimates the intelligence of\n          almost all the jurors that I have worked with\n          over the years, but, nonetheless, this is the\n          federal rule. It's been abolished in a number\n          of states, but it is the federal rule. So we\n          have to respect it. Like I say, whether we\n          agree with the wisdom of a rule or not, it is\n          the rule, the rule we follow.\n                 But, again, don't over-interpret what I\n          said. Of course you'll talk about interesting\n          things that happened during the course of the\n          trial, idiosyncracies of the judge and the\n          lawyers, interesting things witnesses say,\n          significant pieces of evidence. Just do not\n          express an opinion about the case, again,\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\f          until you begin deliberations and each have an\n          opportunity to make your opinions known.\n\n          Jadlowe's counsel properly objected to the instruction,\n\narguing that \"it's inappropriate for the jurors to discuss the case\n\nin any way, shape, or form until all of the evidence is in, they've\n\nheard closing argument, and they'[v]e heard your Honor's charge.\"\n\nThe court disagreed:\n\n          No.   Human nature, if you tell them not to\n          discuss the case, defies anything we know\n          about human beings. What's important is that\n          they not form any ultimate opinions about the\n          case until they've heard all of the evidence\n          and that they not express opinions about the\n          resolution of the case to one another.    And\n          that's – if you want me to repeat the thrust\n          of that instruction again, I will, but that's\n          what I meant.\n\nDefense counsel then elaborated on his concern:\n\n                 Your honor, my objection is I don't\n          think   they    should   be   talking   about\n          \"interesting things that the witnesses said.\"\n          I just think that that's not what the jury\n          should be doing. They should be simply – they\n          can talk about the weather or the Red Sox.\n          They should not be talking about the case.\n\nThe court concluded the colloquy as follows:\n\n                 I disagree, and I think that's the\n          reason states, at least those who have a\n          progressive view of jury service, have\n          abolished that rule now. In fact, even as to\n          ultimate opinions as to the case, which I\n          restrict them from talking about. I think you\n          will find that the modern trend is against the\n          old-fashion rule.\n\n          The   court's   instruction   was   unmistakably   erroneous,\n\nincluding the assumption that the \"modern trend\" in criminal cases\n\n                                -25-\n\fis to allow juror discussion.        For more than a century, it has been\n\na common-law principle that \"it is improper for jurors to discuss\n\na case prior to its submission to them,\" a practice that safeguards\n\na defendant's \"entitle[ment] under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments\n\nto   the    Constitution   to   a   fair   trial   to   an   impartial   jury.\"\n\nWinebrenner v.

The\nrelevant report data was generated from 11,752 surveys completed by\njudges and lawyers involved in state and federal trials that took\nplace primarily between 2002 and 2006. Gregory E.

See Resko, 3 F.3d at 689; Winebrenner, 147\n\nF.2d at 328-29.           The court in Resko cogently summarized these\n\nconcerns in a criminal case:\n\n           First, since the prosecution presents its\n           evidence first, any premature discussions are\n           likely to occur before the defendant has a\n           chance to present all of his or her evidence,\n           and it is likely that any initial opinions\n           formed by the jurors, which will likely\n           influence other jurors, will be unfavorable to\n           the defendant for this reason. Second, once a\n           juror expresses his or her views in the\n           presence of other jurors, he or she is likely\n           to continue to adhere to that opinion and to\n           pay greater attention to evidence presented\n           that    comports     with    that     opinion.\n           Consequently,   the   mere   act   of   openly\n           expressing his or her views may tend to cause\n           the juror to approach the case with less than\n           a fully open mind and to adhere to the\n           publicly expressed viewpoint.\n\n           Third, the jury system is meant to involve\n           decisionmaking as a collective, deliberative\n           process   and  premature  discussions  among\n           individual jurors may thwart that goal.\n           Fourth, because the court provides the jury\n\n                                      -30-\n\f          with legal instructions only after all the\n          evidence has been presented, jurors who engage\n          in premature deliberations do so without the\n          benefit of the court's instructions on the\n          reasonable   doubt   standard.     Fifth,   if\n          premature deliberations occur before the\n          defendant has had an opportunity to present\n          all of his or her evidence . . . and jurors\n          form premature conclusions about the case, the\n          burden of proof will have been, in effect,\n          shifted from the government to the defendant,\n          who has \"the burden of changing by evidence\n          the opinion thus formed.\" [Winebrenner, 147\n          F.2d] at 328.30\n\n          Finally, requiring the jury to refrain from\n          prematurely discussing the case with fellow\n          jurors in a criminal case helps protect a\n          defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a fair\n          trial as well as his or her due process right\n          to place the burden on the government to prove\n          its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n3 F.3d at 689-90 (citations omitted).\n\n          To be sure, not all of these reasons have force when the\n\njurors are expressly told – as they are, for example, in Arizona –\n\nthat they may discuss the evidence only in the presence of all\n\njurors and that they must \"reserve judgment about the outcome of\n\nthe case until deliberations commence.\"   Ariz. R. Civ. P. 39(f).\n\n(Essentially, that is what the trial court told the jurors here.)\n\n\n     30\n        In this case, for example, Jadlowe points out that the\ngovernment introduced a number of audio recordings to prove his\ninvolvement in the drug conspiracy and that the jurors could have\nconcluded early in the case, after discussion among themselves,\nthat those tapes reflected his participation.    Defense counsel,\nhowever, later sought to give those cryptic conversations a more\nbenign interpretation by introducing other audio recordings\nindicating that Ferreira and Gonsalves were involved in various\nconstruction projects with the speaker believed to be Jadlowe and\nthat furniture was being stored in the garage.\n\n                              -31-\n\fYet, impressions formed about the evidence early on may nonetheless\n\nhave a significant impact on the verdict, even if the jurors do not\n\nmake their ultimate judgment until the end of the case.                         In our\n\nview, the traditional rationales remain persuasive.\n\n             Of course, not all premature jury discussion about a case\n\nwill compromise a defendant's fair trial rights, particularly where\n\nthe conversation does not reflect a point of view about the\n\nevidence or the outcome.               See, e.g., United States v. Diaz, 597\n\nF.3d   56,   63    (1st      Cir.   2010)      (noting     that    jurors    apparently\n\ndiscussed only \"a legal principle\" and not \"the merits of the case\n\nagainst the defendant\").              Discussion such as that endorsed by the\n\ncourt in this case, however – about \"interesting things witnesses\n\nsay, significant pieces of evidence\" – is inappropriate, even if\n\nthe    conversation       was    not    what    we    ordinarily      would    consider\n\npremature \"deliberations.\" Cf. State v. Washington, 438 A.2d 1144,\n\n1148 (Conn. 1980) (noting that \"[d]iscussion is an integral part of\n\ndeliberations\"         and    that,     \"[i]n    a    constitutional        sense,   the\n\ndistinction between discussion and deliberation is more apparent\n\nthan real\"). Moreover, while jury discussion that does not involve\n\nexpressions       of    ultimate       opinions      may   be     found   harmless   in\n\nretrospect, it is a different question whether district courts may\n\ngive the jury permission at the outset of the trial to talk about\n\nthe case before formal deliberations begin.                     We now hold expressly\n\nthat they may not.           We thus conclude that the court erred by giving\n\n\n                                          -32-\n\fthe jurors permission to discuss significant aspects of the case as\n\nthe trial progressed.31\n\nB. Does the Error Require a New Trial?\n\n             1. Was the Instruction Structural Error?\n\n             Jadlowe argues that the court's instruction resulted in\n\nthe denial of his due process rights and his right to a fair trial,\n\nand   that   it   should   be   considered   structural   error    requiring\n\nreversal without a showing of prejudice.        See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Marcus, 130 S. Ct. 2159, 2164 (2010) (describing structural\n\nerrors as \"a very limited class of errors that affect the framework\n\nwithin which the trial proceeds\" (citations omitted) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); Neder, 527 U.S. at 8.                   He further\n\ncontends that, even if the error is not deemed structural, a new\n\ntrial is necessary because the government is unable to prove the\n\nabsence of prejudice from the instruction.        See Neder, 527 U.S. at\n\n7 (noting that most constitutional errors may be disregarded where\n\nthey are \"harmless 'beyond a reasonable doubt'\" (quoting Chapman v.\n\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967)); United States v. Carpenter,\n\n403 F.3d 9, 11-12 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             The question in identifying structural error is whether\n\nthe error affects the \"'framework'\" of the trial, \"'rather than\n\n\n\n      31\n          Although this case does not require us to impose an\naffirmative requirement that courts tell jurors not to discuss the\ncase until deliberations formally begin, such an instruction is\nunquestionably the better practice.\n\n                                    -33-\n\fsimply   . . . the trial process itself.'\" Neder, 527 U.S. at 8\n\n(quoting Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 310 (1991)). In such\n\ninstances, \"it is often 'difficul[t]' to 'asses[s] the effect of\n\nthe error,'\"   Marcus, 130 S. Ct. at 2165 (quoting United States v.\n\nGonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 149 n.4 (2006)), because the nature\n\nof a structural error is to \"produce[] 'consequences that are\n\nnecessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate,'\" Neder, 527 U.S. at\n\n11 (quoting Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 282 (1993)).   The\n\nfrequently cited examples of such errors include the complete\n\ndenial of counsel, a biased presiding judge, the denial of a public\n\ntrial, and a defective instruction on reasonable doubt.   Id. at 8;\n\nsee also, e.g., United States v. Curbelo, 343 F.3d 273, 281 (4th\n\nCir. 2003) (concluding that trial court's decision to proceed with\n\nan eleven-person jury, over defendant's objection, was structural\n\nerror requiring reversal).\n\n          In the Supreme Court cases finding structural error, the\n\nerrors themselves effected a deprivation of rights, so that \"[n]o\n\nadditional showing of prejudice is required to make the violation\n\n'complete.'\" Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. at 146. The Court explained\n\nthat characteristic of structural error in Gonzalez-Lopez, where it\n\ncontrasted denial of a criminal defendant's choice of counsel –\n\nwhich it held to be structural error – with denial of the Sixth\n\nAmendment right to effective representation of counsel – which\n\nrequires an additional showing of prejudice.       Id. at 147-48.\n\n\n                               -34-\n\fDeprivation of the right of choice is \"'complete,'\" the Court\n\nexplained, \"when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being\n\nrepresented by the lawyer he wants, regardless of the quality of\n\nthe representation he received.\"                  Id. at 148.         By contrast,\n\nviolation of \"the right to effective counsel\" depends on the\n\ncompetence of \"whatever lawyer is chosen or appointed.\"                   Id.\n\n              The   type    of    error    at    issue   here   has    \"framework\"\n\nimplications.       If the court's faulty instruction results in early\n\ndiscussion of the evidence or witnesses by the jurors, their later\n\ndeliberations may be prejudiced in ways that would be difficult to\n\nidentify or quantify.             The jury's deliberative process – the\n\ncollective, objective review of the evidence of record, evaluated\n\nas a whole, and guided by the court's closing instructions – may be\n\ncompromised as a result of prematurely formed impressions.                      That\n\npotential harm is unlike the erroneous introduction of a piece of\n\nevidence or a flawed instruction that misstates or omits an element\n\nof the crime.       Such errors are discrete trial events whose effect\n\non the outcome of the trial may be evaluated in light of the\n\nproperly admitted evidence or the instruction as a whole.                         By\n\ncontrast, premature discussion raises the possibility that the\n\njurors will view all of the evidence through a distorted lens, much\n\nlike   what    occurs      when   the   jury     is   improperly   instructed     on\n\nreasonable doubt.          See Neder, 527 U.S. at 10-11 (noting that a\n\nflawed reasonable doubt instruction is \"not subject to harmless-\n\n\n                                          -35-\n\ferror analysis because it 'vitiates all the jury's findings'\"\n\n(quoting Sullivan, 508 U.S. at 281)). Where the possibility exists\n\nthat premature jury discussions shifted to the defendant \"the\n\nburden    of     changing    by   evidence   the    opinion    thus     formed,\"\n\nWinebrenner, 147 F.2d at 328, the possibility exists that the trial\n\nwas \"an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence,\"\n\nNeder, 527 U.S. at 9.\n\n            Yet, the error here differs in a significant way from\n\nthose the Supreme Court has labeled structural.                   Although the\n\ninstruction opens the door to discussion \"taint[ing] the process by\n\nwhich    guilt    [is]    determined,\"   Curbelo,    343   F.3d   at   285,   the\n\ndefendant will not necessarily be denied a fair trial as a result\n\nof the error.       Despite the instruction, juror discussion may not\n\ntake place at all, and even if some preliminary conversation about\n\nthe case occurs, it may be tangential to the jurors' determination\n\nof guilt or innocence.        Unlike the complete denial of counsel or a\n\npublic    trial,    for   example,   the   harm    triggered   by   the   flawed\n\ninstruction does not occur – i.e., the constitutional violation is\n\nnot \"complete\" – until prejudicial discussion occurs.                  It is not\n\nnecessarily the case, therefore, that \"all or almost all such\n\nerrors always 'affec[t] the framework within which the trial\n\nproceeds,' or 'necessarily render a criminal trial fundamentally\n\nunfair.'\" Marcus, 130 S. Ct. at 2166 (quoting Fulminante, 499 U.S.\n\nat 310, and Neder, 527 U.S. at 9).\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\f             Jadlowe contends that the error must nonetheless be\n\nconsidered structural because a defendant would never be able to\n\nprobe the jury's deliberations to prove prejudice.         Inquiries into\n\njury deliberations are, in fact, narrowly restricted by Federal\n\nRule of Evidence 606(b), which bars juror testimony \"as to any\n\nmatter or statement occurring during the course of the jury's\n\ndeliberations.\"      The relevant inquiry, however, is not into the\n\nnature   of    the   formal   deliberations   that    occurred   once    the\n\npresentation of evidence concluded, but the nature of any juror\n\ndiscussion about the case prior to the formal deliberations.\n\nProbing such premature discussions is neither impermissible nor\n\nimpossible.    Indeed, courts routinely examine allegations of juror\n\nmisconduct      involving     improper     external     influences       and\n\ncommunications among jurors, and we see no relevant distinction\n\nbetween those contexts and this one.       The threshold question would\n\nbe whether any premature discussion took place.            If so, was it\n\namong all jurors or just a few?          Did discussion occur regularly\n\nthrough the proceedings, or only once – and at what point?               What\n\nwas the content of the discussion?\n\n             We thus conclude that Supreme Court precedent \"insist[s]\n\nupon a showing of individual prejudice\" when a court improperly\n\ninstructs jurors in a criminal case that they may discuss the\n\nevidence before formal deliberations commence.         Marcus, 130 S. Ct.\n\nat   2166.     Indeed,   although   the    practice   remains    rare,   the\n\n\n                                    -37-\n\fauthorization of jury discussion in criminal cases by some courts\n\nand the Arizona Supreme Court Committee's recommendation that it be\n\npermitted     in   both   civil     and    criminal    trials   reinforce    our\n\nconclusion that the instruction here should not be classified as\n\nstructural error requiring automatic reversal of the defendant's\n\nconviction.    See supra nn. 25, 26 & related text; cf. Resko, 3 F.3d\n\nat 695 (\"[W]e are unwilling to assume the existence of prejudice\n\nbecause we are far less certain that premature deliberations will\n\nlead to prejudice in every, or nearly every, instance.\"); United\n\nStates v. Cruz, 156 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir. 1998) (upholding as\n\nadequate remedy the dismissal of three jurors who were heard\n\ndiscussing the case during a recess).\n\n            2. Prejudice\n\n            When a defendant properly preserves an objection to a\n\ntrial error, the government bears the burden of proving that the\n\nerror was harmless.         United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734\n\n(1993); Curbelo, 343 F.3d at 278; United States v. Colón-Muñoz, 192\n\nF.3d 210, 222 (1st Cir. 1999). For most constitutional errors, the\n\ngovernment    must   show    that    the    error     was   harmless    beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt, Chapman, 386 U.S. at 24, and for most non-\n\nconstitutional errors, the government must show that the error \"did\n\nnot have a 'substantial and injurious effect or influence in\n\ndetermining the jury's verdict,'\" Curbelo, 343 F.3d at 278 (quoting\n\nKotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776 (1946)).                 The choice\n\n\n                                      -38-\n\fof standard need not detain us because, on this record, the outcome\n\nis the same under either one.\n\n              Neither the defendant nor the government asked the court\n\nto question the jurors about whether they had discussed any aspect\n\nof    the   case    during   the   five   days   of   trial,   and   no   inquiry\n\nconsequently was made into the content of any conversations they\n\nmay have had.       Such an inquiry could have revealed that the jurors\n\ndiscussed only tangential matters, allowing the government to\n\neasily satisfy its burden to show an absence of prejudice from the\n\ncourt's erroneous instruction.              In some cases, such an inquiry\n\ncould produce evidence that would advance the defendant's claim of\n\nprejudicial error. Given the potential significance of the jurors'\n\nactual response to an instruction allowing them to converse about\n\nthe trial as it unfolds, both the prosecutor and defense counsel\n\nwould be well advised to request a jury inquiry whenever a court\n\ngives an instruction like the one challenged in this case.\n\n              Here, the record is silent on whether the jurors engaged\n\nin premature discussions of the case and, hence, we must resolve\n\nthe   issue    of   prejudice      by   examining   the   information     that   is\n\navailable to us.         Our starting point is the flawed instruction\n\nitself. The district court explicitly told the jurors, twice, \"not\n\nto express an ultimate opinion about the outcome of the case,\"\n\ndirecting them to wait \"until you begin deliberations and each have\n\nan opportunity to make your opinions known.\"                Pursuant to well-\n\n\n                                         -39-\n\festablished precedent, \"'we presume juries understand and follow\n\nthe court's instructions.'\" United States v. Gentles, 619 F.3d 75,\n\n85 (1st Cir. 2010) (quoting            United States v. Vázquez-Botet, 532\n\nF.3d 37, 56 (1st Cir. 2008)).          We thus presume that the jurors did\n\nnot express opinions about Jadlowe's guilt or innocence.\n\n            The court, however, told the jurors they could discuss\n\n\"idiosyncracies of the judge and the lawyers, interesting things\n\nwitnesses say, significant pieces of evidence.\" Thus, in assessing\n\nthe impact of the court's error, the question is whether we can say\n\nwith assurance that, even if discussion of those matters occurred,\n\nthe jury's deliberative process was not compromised.              Our concern\n\nis    whether   the    jurors   were   able   to   objectively   evaluate   the\n\nevidence as a whole when they engaged in formal deliberations,\n\nguided by the court's closing instructions.             See Resko, 3 F.3d at\n\n692    (focusing on the loss of \"the jurors' impartiality\" as the\n\nprejudice from an instruction allowing premature deliberations);\n\nWinebrenner,     147    F.2d    at   327   (\"Whether   guilty    or   innocent,\n\nappellants were entitled under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to\n\nthe Constitution to a fair trial to an impartial jury.\"); id. at\n\n330 (referring to the \"right of the defendants to open minded\n\ndeliberation\") (Woodrough, J., dissenting).\n\n            We can easily discount the impact of any discussion about\n\nidiosyncrasies of the personnel.           Such observations would have had\n\nlittle or no effect on the jurors' ability to dispassionately\n\n\n                                       -40-\n\fconsider        the    evidence   against      Jadlowe       in   its   entirety.     We\n\nacknowledge, however, that the possible discussion of \"significant\n\npieces of evidence\" or interesting testimony is more troubling.\n\nSuch premature evidentiary deliberation could, in close cases, skew\n\nthe final weighing of all the evidence.                      This is not, however, a\n\nclose case.            Video surveillance and audiotapes, bolstered by\n\ncompelling circumstantial evidence, placed Jadlowe in the midst of\n\na drug scheme that involved the temporary storage of ten kilograms\n\nof cocaine in his garage.                    Despite flaws in the way certain\n\nevidence was presented, the record leaves no doubt about Jadlowe's\n\ncomplicity in the drug conspiracy.\n\n                Thus, even if we assume that some jurors talked too soon\n\nabout the inculpatory tendency of certain evidence, the force of\n\nthe government's case as a whole meant that any comments made\n\nduring the course of the proceedings almost certainly had no\n\ninfluence on the jurors' ultimate evaluation of Jadlowe's guilt or\n\ninnocence.            Inescapably, the possibility of taint to the jury\n\nprocess        from     conversations         about     particular         evidence   was\n\ndiminished, if not entirely negated, by the overwhelming proof of\n\nguilt        that   confronted    the    jurors       when   they   commenced      formal\n\ndeliberations.32           Because      we    are   persuaded       that    the   court's\n\n\n        32\n       We emphasize that we consider the strength of the evidence\nin this context not to demonstrate that the evidence was sufficient\nto establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but as part of our\ninquiry into whether premature discussion could have compromised\nthe jury's deliberative process. Harm to the deliberative process\n\n                                             -41-\n\ferroneous instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\nJadlowe is not entitled to a new trial on the basis of that error.\n\n                                         IV.\n\n            Jadlowe      asserts   that     the   district      court    erred   in\n\nadmitting four types of evidence at trial: (1) a summary chart of\n\nwiretapped phone calls, (2) Agent Fallon's testimony identifying\n\nhim on the surveillance video she recorded at 30 Arch Street on\n\nNovember    4,   2005,     (3)   Agent    Simmons's   testimony         identifying\n\nJadlowe's   voice     in   wiretapped      calls,   and   (4)    transcripts     of\n\nwiretapped conversations that identified Jadlowe as one of the\n\nspeakers.\n\n            We review the district court's decisions to admit or\n\nexclude evidence for abuse of discretion.             Diaz, 597 F.3d at 64.\n\nA. The Summary Chart\n\n            Jadlowe argues that Government Exhibit 10, a six-column\n\nchart listing details for twenty-two of the intercepted phone\n\ncalls, contained testimonial hearsay that should have been ruled\n\ninadmissible at trial.           Specifically, he objects to the final\n\ncolumn on the chart, which identifies the other phone number\n\n\n\n\ncould occur even in the face of powerful evidence of guilt. The\njury process almost certainly would be tainted, for example, by an\ninstruction allowing discussion of the ultimate issue of guilt\nbefore all of the evidence was presented, regardless of the\nstrength of the government's case.\n\n                                         -42-\n\finvolved in each of the listed wiretapped conversations.33   Eleven\n\nof the twenty-two calls were made to or from a number associated\n\nwith the 1022 phone seized from Jadlowe.   There is no dispute about\n\nthe admissibility of the first five columns, which report, inter\n\nalia, the date and time of each call and which targeted phone\n\nnumber, Ferreira's or Gonzalves's, was involved.   That information\n\nalso was listed on a computerized printout labeled as Exhibit 9,\n\nwhich Jadlowe concedes was properly admitted.\n\n          The information in Column 6 did not appear in written\n\nform on any other document admitted into evidence, and Jadlowe\n\ncorrectly points out that there is no evidence in the record about\n\nthe creation of Column 6.   The government argues that Column 6 was\n\nadmissible because the same information was contained in digital\n\nfiles that were part of Exhibit 8.     Exhibit 8 is a compact disk\n\n(\"CD\") that contains the oral recordings of the twenty-two phone\n\ncalls listed on Exhibit 10; according to the government, the Column\n\n6 information for each call is appended to its oral recording on\n\nthe CD.   The testimony at trial indicated that the data on the CD\n\nwas not accessible to the jurors, however, and the government at\n\noral argument essentially confirmed that was so.34\n\n\n     33\n       Column 6, labeled \"Direction of Call/Phone No.\" also states\nwhether the call was incoming or outgoing.\n     34\n        In its brief, the government describes Exhibit 9 as \"a\ncomputer-generated print-out of some of the embedded data from\nth[e] calls.\"   The record does not reveal whether the Column 6\ninformation could have been retrieved in a similar format or how\n\n                                -43-\n\f          Given the government's concession, we think there is\n\nforce to the argument that Column 6 did not qualify as a summary of\n\nevidence already in the record.    We nonetheless decline to probe\n\nother theories in support of its admission. Column 6 provided only\n\none link between Jadlowe and the conspiracy by identifying the 1022\n\nnumber as the other phone number in some of the intercepted calls.\n\nAs we describe below in Section B, the audio and video surveillance\n\nproduced much more direct evidence of Jadlowe's participation in\n\nthe calls.35    Hence, any error in allowing the list into evidence\n\nwas harmless.\n\nB. The Remaining Evidentiary Issues\n\n          Jadlowe's three remaining contentions all concern the\n\nways in which he was identified at trial as the individual who made\n\nthe arrangements with Gonsalves and Ferreira for the cocaine\n\ndelivery at 30 Arch Street.     Agent Fallon identified him in the\n\nsurveillance videotape shown at trial by comparing a photograph of\n\nhim to the video image.    Agent Simmons identified a voice on the\n\ntapes of the wiretapped phone calls as Jadlowe's, even though he\n\n\neasy it would be to do so.\n     35\n        Exhibit 10's relative unimportance to the case is reflected\nin a colloquy that took place at the close of evidence.        When\ndefense counsel renewed the objection to Exhibit 10, the district\ncourt commented that it did not view the document \"as being a very\ncritical piece of evidence linking anything to anything.\"       The\nprosecutor agreed and stated that he would not object to its being\nredacted or excluded.    The court said it would make a decision\nafter reviewing Agent Fallon's testimony and, later that day, ruled\nthe exhibit admissible without restriction.\n\n                                -44-\n\fhad never spoken with Jadlowe in person; the transcripts of the\n\nwiretapped conversations given to the jury reflected Simmons's\n\nidentification of Jadlowe as one of the speakers.\n\n          Jadlowe argues that the visual and voice identifications\n\nconstituted   improper    lay   opinion    testimony   because   neither\n\nofficer's identification was based on prior personal experience\n\nwith Jadlowe and \"[t]he jury was perfectly capable of drawing its\n\nown independent conclusion[s] based on the evidence presented.\"\n\nUnited States v. Garcia-Ortiz, 528 F.3d 74, 80 (1st Cir. 2008); see\n\nalso Fed. R. Evid. 701 (allowing lay opinion testimony if, inter\n\nalia, it is \"rationally based on the perception of the witness\" and\n\n\"helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the\n\ndetermination of a fact in issue\").        He asserts that the district\n\ncourt also abused its discretion in allowing the government to\n\nprovide the jury with transcripts that presented as fact that he\n\nwas the speaker.\n\n          We agree that the officers' identifications should not\n\nhave been allowed as lay opinion testimony because neither Fallon\n\nnor Simmons was in a better position than the jurors to make the\n\nidentity judgments.      Indeed, Fallon testified that she made the\n\nidentification by comparing his image on the screen with a driver's\n\nlicense photo that was in evidence.       We are at a loss to understand\n\nthe government's argument that Fallon was better situated than the\n\njurors simply because she was watching the events as they were\n\n\n                                  -45-\n\foccurring.    At the time, she was looking at the same video image\n\nseen by the jurors at trial; the Registry of Motor Vehicle's\n\nphotograph also was in evidence.36          In addition, although the\n\ngovernment is correct that \"identification of a telephone caller\n\nmay be [established] by circumstantial evidence,\" United States v.\n\nDiMuro, 540 F.2d 503, 514 (1st Cir. 1976) (quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted) (alteration in original), the circumstantial\n\nevidence on which Simmons relied to infer that Jadlowe was the\n\nspeaker in the wiretapped conversations – the content of the calls\n\nand the physical surveillance reports – also was available to the\n\njury.\n\n            Nonetheless,     any   error   in   allowing   the   officers'\n\nidentifications   or   the   related   transcripts   was   unquestionably\n\nharmless.     An abundance of circumstantial evidence pointed to\n\nJadlowe as the individual whom Fallon saw clearing the garage at 30\n\nArch Street and whom Simmons heard in the phone conversations with\n\nFerreira and Gonsalves.\n\n            In a phone conversation on October 8, for example, the\n\ncaller whose voice Simmons identified as Jadlowe's reported to\n\nGonsalves that he would be getting his hair braided and that he had\n\nbeen home all day on his birthday.         Both items of information in\n\n\n     36\n       Fallon also testified that her       identification was aided by\ninformation from other officers on          the scene confirming that\nJadlowe was the person she was seeing        on the video screen. That\nreliance on others further diminishes       the foundation for her own\nidentification.\n\n                                    -46-\n\fthe call were linked to Jadlowe.              According to motor vehicle\n\nrecords, Jadlowe's birthday was the day before, October 7, and\n\nSimmons, who had seen Jadlowe multiple times before, testified that\n\nhe   saw   Jadlowe   with   newly   braided    hair   shortly   after   this\n\nconversation.    In a call with Gonsalves on November 4, the speaker\n\nSimmons identified as Jadlowe was addressed as \"Uncle Marc,\" and in\n\nanother call the same day, just before 2 p.m., that speaker told\n\nGonsalves that he was \"[t]aking care of the garage\" and that he was\n\n\"[d]oin' it right now.\"     According to Agent Fallon's testimony, it\n\nwas at about that time that, with other officers' assistance, she\n\nidentified Jadlowe as the individual she had seen moving items from\n\nthe garage to the yard at 30 Arch Street.\n\n            Simmons's ability to identify Jadlowe in each instance in\n\nwhich Jadlowe was designated on the transcript as the speaker was\n\nsupported by the agent's admissible testimony that he had listened\n\nto 25 to 50 calls involving the number associated with the phone\n\nseized from Jadlowe at 30 Arch Street on November 4, 2005, and that\n\nover time he was able to recognize the callers in those wiretapped\n\nconversations after \"hearing the same voices every day.\"                 He\n\ntestified that he had heard no one on that phone           other than the\n\nspeaker Gonsalves referred to as \"Uncle Marc\" in the November 4\n\ncall.   Each of the calls attributed to Jadlowe was thus identified\n\nby Simmons as involving the same voice, including the other calls\n\ndescribed above whose content was linked to Jadlowe.\n\n\n                                    -47-\n\f             Hence, even if it were improper for Simmons and Fallon to\n\nhave offered their opinions that Jadlowe was the speaker in the\n\nwiretapped calls and the individual in the videotape, we are\n\nconfident that any such error did not influence the verdict.              This\n\nis equally true of the jury's exposure to the transcripts.                Not\n\nonly was there compelling circumstantial evidence that Jadlowe was\n\nproperly identified as the speaker in the calls, but the district\n\ncourt also instructed the jurors at the time they received the\n\ntranscripts that it was up to them \"to make a determination as to\n\nwhether the transcript is correct in its identification of Mr.\n\nJadlowe as the speaker at the points at which he is so listed in\n\nthe transcript.\"       The court emphasized that \"the transcript is\n\nonly an aid,\" and that the jurors would \"have to look to other\n\nevidence in the case to ensure yourself that that indeed is true.\"\n\nThe court repeated that caution in its charge at the close of\n\nevidence, telling the jurors that if they \"believe that the speaker\n\nhas   been   wrongly   identified,    keep   in   mind   that   it   is   your\n\nunderstanding of the recording that matters.\"\n\n             On this record, there was no reversible error stemming\n\nfrom the challenged evidentiary rulings.\n\n                                      V.\n\n             Jadlowe has pressed serious concerns about the admission\n\nof evidence and the jury instructions, and on some of those issues\n\nwe agree that the district court erred.           On the record before us,\n\n\n                                     -48-\n\fhowever, we cannot agree that those errors require a new trial.\n\nThe judgment of conviction is therefore affirmed.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -49-\n\f",

Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f             LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.            Appellant Marc Jadlowe raises\n\nmultiple issues of substance in challenging his conviction on drug\n\nconspiracy     charges.        Most   significantly,       he   argues    that   the\n\ndistrict court committed structural error by instructing the jurors\n\nthat they could discuss the case among themselves during the trial,\n\nbefore     formal    deliberations     commenced.          We   agree     that   the\n\ninstruction was erroneous. We conclude, however, that a showing of\n\nprejudice is necessary to justify a new trial based on premature\n\njury discussions.           As the record here shows beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that the flawed instruction did not compromise the jury's\n\ndeliberative process, Jadlowe is not entitled to a new trial on\n\nthat basis.      We also find no reversible error in the suppression\n\nand evidentiary rulings that Jadlowe disputes. We therefore affirm\n\nthe judgment of conviction.\n\n                                        I.\n\n             In November 2005, a federal grand jury charged Jadlowe\n\nand   fourteen      other    individuals     in   an   eleven-count      indictment\n\nalleging various drug-related crimes.1                 Jadlowe was named in two\n\ncounts, one alleging conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine,\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, and the other alleging possession\n\nand distribution of cocaine on November 4, 2005, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1).            We set forth here the background of the\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          All of Jadlowe's co-defendants pled guilty.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fconspiracy, as depicted by the government at a suppression hearing\n\nand at trial.2\n\n               In      late      September      2005,      the   Drug    Enforcement\n\nAdministration (\"DEA\") initiated a wiretap on the phone of Brandin\n\nGonsalves,          one   of     Jadlowe's     co-defendants,     as    part    of   an\n\ninvestigation into drug trafficking activities in and around New\n\nBedford, Massachusetts.               Within the first week of the wiretap, the\n\nDEA intercepted a call between Gonsalves and another defendant,\n\nJohn       Ferreira,      Jr.,   in   which    the   men   discussed    using   \"Uncle\n\nMar[c]'s\" garage to store a suspected shipment of cocaine.3                          Law\n\nenforcement agents concluded that \"Uncle Marc\" was Jadlowe based\n\non, inter alia, pen register data obtained from Gonsalves's phone\n\nshowing that Gonsalves frequently exchanged calls with a phone\n\nnumber the agents linked to Jadlowe.4\n\n\n       2\n       Jadlowe does not dispute the sequence of events described by\nthe government, but he claims that the government did not prove his\nknowing involvement in a cocaine conspiracy.         He argues in\nparticular that the admissible evidence failed to show that he was\none of the participants in a series of wiretapped phone\nconversations in which the government identified him as a speaker\nor that he was the individual seen on a videotape made by officers\ndoing surveillance at his home.\n       3\n       On October 21, 2005, the government obtained court approval\nfor a second wiretap of Gonsalves's phone and an initial wiretap of\nFerreira's phone.\n       4\n       A \"pen register\" is a device used, inter alia, to record the\ndialing and other information transmitted by a targeted phone. 18\nU.S.C. § 3127(3); see also United States v.

On October 8, Gonsalves\n\nand Jadlowe discussed putting a generator in Jadlowe's house and\n\nrunning an extension cord, apparently to provide light for the\n\nunloading of the cocaine in the garage.5                Although Gonsalves told\n\nJadlowe the drugs were expected to arrive \"in a couple of days,\"\n\na call between Gonsalves and Ferreira on October 21 indicated that\n\nthe delivery had been delayed because the supplier had run into\n\nproblems with law enforcement authorities.6\n\n            On    November    3,    the   DEA    intercepted    a   call   between\n\nFerreira and an unidentified male who reported that \"[m]y plane got\n\ndelayed but, yeah my girl be here early in the morning,\" prompting\n\nagents to set up surveillance for the next day at Jadlowe's home at\n\n\n\n\ncalled, the duration of the call, the time of day of the call, and\nwe would get that real time.\"\n     5\n       Agent Simmons testified that the gas and electricity were\nshut off at Jadlowe's home address during that time period.\n     6\n       In the call, Ferreira told Gonsalves that he had spoken with\n\"Fofado\" and that \"Rudolfo got bagged up by the feds . . .\n[c]rossin' you know.\" Agent Simmons testified that the government\nwas unable to identify Rudolfo or to connect this conversation with\na specific drug seizure.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f30 Arch Street in Dartmouth, Massachusetts.7               Early on November 4,\n\nDEA    Special      Agent    Michael   Barbuti     and   other   law    enforcement\n\nofficers began physical surveillance near Arch Street while Agent\n\nSimmons and his team monitored the Gonsalves and Ferriera wiretaps\n\nfrom another location.              At about 11 a.m., DEA Special Agent\n\nJennifer Fallon began surveillance of 30 Arch Street from an\n\nunmarked police truck that was parked on a street parallel to Arch\n\nStreet, monitoring the scene through a video camera.8\n\n                 Shortly before 2 p.m., the multi-faceted surveillance\n\nbore fruit.        Fallon saw someone enter the garage at 30 Arch Street,\n\nat which point she turned on the camera and began videotaping.                  She\n\nthen       saw   the   man   move   items   from   the    garage   to    the   yard.\n\nMeanwhile, the wiretap was capturing calls between Gonsalves and\n\nJadlowe revealing that Jadlowe was clearing out his garage to make\n\n\n\n\n       7\n       The buildings at 30 Arch Street, which were owned by\nJadlowe's family, consisted at that time of an unoccupied house,\nstill under construction, that was attached to the garage at the\nfront of the property and a separate residence behind that\nstructure (identified as 30R Arch Street).     Jadlowe's driver's\nlicense and vehicle registration both listed 30 Arch Street as his\naddress.\n       8\n       Fallon was the only agent with a direct view of 30 Arch\nStreet, but she testified that she \"was just looking at a screen\ninside the truck,\" not out any windows.     Other officers would\noccasionally drive by the house, but Barbuti explained at the\nsuppression hearing that they could not park within sight of the\nhouse because \"[i]t's a very residential area with no sidewalks,\nand vehicles that would be parked there would be easily\nrecognized.\"\n\n                                         -5-\n\froom for a truck.9    About an hour later, Jadlowe called Ferreira\n\nand told him the garage was \"all set\" – the doors were unlocked,\n\nand the back window was open to let in light.   As agents watched,\n\nJadlowe then left the garage and drove away.\n\n          At about 3:45 p.m., agents saw a white truck enter\n\nJadlowe's garage.    At 3:53 p.m., Ferriera called Jadlowe and said\n\nthat \"they\" were over at his house, in the garage, \"right now\" and\n\nhad been there for ten minutes, but that there were \"no lights over\n\nthere.\"   Jadlowe instructed Ferreira to tell them to remove paper\n\nthat was covering the door as a way to allow in more light.     At\n\napproximately 4:16 p.m., Ferreira reported to Jadlowe that \"them\n\ncats are putting the truck back together.   They're out of there.\"\n\nAt about 4:30 p.m., agents saw the truck leave the garage and drive\n\naway and, a minute later, Jadlowe called Ferreira to report that he\n\nhad seen the truck leaving his street.   The two men agreed to meet\n\nat 30 Arch Street.    Jadlowe was seen on the video arriving at his\n\nresidence a few minutes later, and in a series of three recorded\n\nconversations at about 4:40 p.m., Ferreira asked Jadlowe if he\n\ncould \"see them things there . . . [r]ight above the window behind\n\nthe insulation.\"10   The men were still on the phone as Ferreira\n\n\n     9\n       In the first call, at 1:56 p.m., Jadlowe reported that he\nwas \"[t]aking care of the garage.\"      At 2:40 p.m., he told\nGonsalves: \"You should be able to fit the truck in here no\nproblems.\"\n     10\n       Simmons testified that much of the communication between the\nconspirators in this case was conducted by using phones as \"Direct\n\n                                 -6-\n\farrived at 30 Arch Street, at which point he told Jadlowe that he\n\ndid not want \"them things just bring the phone.\"     Ferreira and\n\nJadlowe were seen driving off together at about 4:50 p.m.\n\n          Meanwhile, after being alerted by phone, Massachusetts\n\nState Trooper Stephen Fortin had stopped the white truck for a\n\nlicense plate violation a short distance from 30 Arch Street.\n\nOfficers observed Ferreira drive past the truck and patrol car,\n\nand Simmons testified that contemporaneous phone calls Ferreira\n\nmade to Gonsalves and a man named \"Snack\" revealed that the men\n\nwere \"in somewhat of a panic\" about the truck's detention and the\n\n\"need[] to move the stuff\" from Jadlowe's garage.\n\n          At approximately 5:30 p.m., Agent Fallon saw a car pull\n\ninto the driveway of 30 Arch Street and, with the car's headlights\n\nshining into the garage, an individual entered the building. Agent\n\nBarbuti and his team arrived soon thereafter, and he and another\n\nofficer encountered Jadlowe coming out a door from the garage.\n\nJadlowe was arrested, pat-frisked and handcuffed, and a cell phone\n\nwas taken from him.11   Agents then entered the garage, where they\n\nsaw in plain view ten brick-shaped packages that turned out to be\n\nkilogram amounts of cocaine stacked atop a pile of drywall toward\n\n\nConnect\" devices, a mode in which they functioned like walkie-\ntalkies. When the phones were used that way, a new \"session\" was\nrecorded each time a change in speaker occurred.\n     11\n       There is a disagreement between the parties about whether\nthe record shows that the phone was seized in the frisk. See infra\nSection IIB.\n\n                                -7-\n\fthe rear of the garage.      Several agents remained in the garage\n\novernight while Agent Simmons obtained a search warrant for the\n\nproperty.   At about 11 a.m. the next day, November 5, 2005, agents\n\nexecuted a warrant for Jadlowe's garage and the two houses at 30\n\nand 30R Arch Street.    They seized the ten packages of cocaine from\n\nthe garage and other items, including phone records, from the\n\nhouses.\n\n            Following his indictment on the two drug trafficking\n\ncharges, Jadlowe filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized on\n\nNovember 4 and 5. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court\n\ndenied suppression of the cocaine and the cell phone,12 but granted\n\nhis motion to suppress the evidence seized from the two houses.13\n\nA five-day jury trial concluded on July 7, 2008, with findings of\n\nguilt on both counts.   Jadlowe was sentenced to 120-month terms of\n\nimprisonment on each count, to run concurrently, followed by five\n\nyears of supervised release.\n\n            On appeal, Jadlowe renews his argument that the cocaine\n\nand cell phone should have been suppressed because they were\n\nproducts of the officers' unlawful entry and overnight stay in his\n\ngarage, and he argues that the court also should have suppressed\n\n\n     12\n       The court found that the phone was seized from Jadlowe's\nperson at the time of his arrest.\n     13\n       The government had in fact conceded that the items found in\nthe houses must be suppressed because the affidavit filed in\nsupport of the search warrant application established probable\ncause to search only the garage.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fphone records that he claims were linked to documents found during\n\nthe unlawful search of his home.            He also raises a host of\n\nevidentiary arguments: (1) the court should have excluded an\n\nexhibit containing a list of incoming and outgoing wiretapped calls\n\nbecause that list consisted of inadmissible hearsay; (2) the court\n\nerred in allowing Agent Fallon to give lay opinion testimony\n\nidentifying Jadlowe in the November 4 videotape; (3) the court erred\n\nin allowing Agent Simmons to identify Jadlowe's voice in wiretapped\n\nphone conversations; and (4) the court erred in allowing the jury\n\nto   view   transcripts   of   wiretapped   phone   conversations   that\n\nidentified Jadlowe as one of the speakers.            Finally, Jadlowe\n\nasserts that a new trial is required because the district court\n\nvirtually invited the jury to engage in premature deliberations\n\nwhen it instructed the jurors that, as the trial progressed, they\n\ncould talk about \"interesting things that happened during the\n\ncourse of the trial, . . . interesting things witnesses say,\n\nsignificant pieces of evidence.\"\n\n            We begin our discussion with the court's suppression\n\nrulings.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            Jadlowe challenges the district court's denial of his\n\npretrial motion to suppress the cocaine and cell phone found at 30\n\nArch Street, as well as the court's ruling at trial allowing the\n\ngovernment to introduce records that he claims were the tainted\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f\"fruit\" of the illegal search of his houses.

He     acknowledges     that    Agent    Simmons,   the   lead    law\n\nenforcement officer in the investigation, testified that he would\n\nhave sought a warrant even had the officers not seen the bricks of\n\ncocaine in the garage.            Jadlowe claims, however, that Simmons'\n\nassertion is belied by the officer's earlier testimony that the\n\noperational plan called for seizing the cocaine in a motor vehicle\n\nstop after Gonsalves or Ferreira retrieved the drugs from the\n\ngarage.16 He emphasizes the absence of direct evidence that, at the\n\ntime they entered the garage, the agents intended to obtain a\n\nwarrant and cites cases in which such contemporaneous evidence was\n\n\n     16\n        At the suppression hearing in September 2007, Simmons\ntestified as follows:\n\n          The plan at that time was, if the cocaine was\n     unloaded at that address, it was anticipated that either\n     Mr. Gonsalves or Mr. Ferreira would go to that address to\n     retrieve the cocaine. At that point, once they retrieved\n     the cocaine to move it to another location, we were going\n     to do a motor vehicle stop of their vehicle in order to\n     obtain the cocaine.\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fpresent.

The record permitted the district court\n\nto find that the officers had not applied for a warrant earlier\n\nbecause they expected to arrest one or more of the conspirators and\n\nseize the drugs in a vehicle stop. Although the officers' strategy\n\nchanged as the events of November 4 unfolded, their testimony\n\nreflects an assumption that cocaine would be – and then was –\n\ndelivered to Jadlowe's garage.    Simmons testified that when the\n\nwiretaps revealed the conspirators' intent to move the cocaine from\n\nthe garage to a different, less accessible location, the officers\n\ndetermined that they might need to take action at 30 Arch Street.\n\nBarbuti's testimony similarly reflects a belief that there was\n\n\n\napplies when the evidence at issue was not later obtained\nindependently, but it \"'inevitably would have been discovered by\nlawful means.'\" Id.

The Supreme Court similarly has observed that \"[t]he\ninevitable discovery doctrine . . . is in reality an extrapolation\nfrom the independent source doctrine: Since the tainted evidence\nwould be admissible if in fact discovered through an independent\nsource, it should be admissible if it inevitably would have been\ndiscovered.\" Murray, 487 U.S. at 539.

The Supreme Court in Murray explicitly rejected\n\nsuch an argument:\n\n            As petitioners see the incentives, law\n            enforcement officers will routinely enter\n            without a warrant to make sure that what they\n            expect to be on the premises is in fact there.\n            If it is not, they will have spared themselves\n            the time and trouble of getting a warrant; if\n            it is, they can get the warrant and use the\n            evidence despite the unlawful entry. We see\n            the incentives differently. An officer with\n            probable cause sufficient to obtain a search\n            warrant would be foolish to enter the premises\n            first in an unlawful manner. By doing so, he\n            would risk suppression of all evidence on the\n            premises, both seen and unseen, since his\n            action would add to the normal burden of\n            convincing a magistrate that there is probable\n            cause the much more onerous burden of\n            convincing a trial court that no information\n            gained from the illegal entry affected either\n            the law enforcement officers' decision to seek\n            a warrant or the magistrate's decision to\n            grant it.     Nor would the officer without\n\n                                 -16-\n\f            sufficient probable cause to obtain a search\n            warrant have any added incentive to conduct an\n            unlawful entry, since whatever he finds cannot\n            be used to establish probable cause before a\n            magistrate.\n\n487 U.S. at 539-40.\n\n            Nor are we persuaded by Jadlowe's attempt to depict this\n\nas the egregious case where suppression is necessary to vindicate\n\nthe principles underlying the exclusionary rule.

The Phone Records\n\n                  At trial, the government introduced, as Exhibit 12,\n\nSprint Nextel phone records that Jadlowe claims should have been\n\nsuppressed because they were the fruit of the government's illegal\n\n\n\n        22\n       In his motion to suppress, Jadlowe stated: \"The defendant\nalso moves to suppress any evidence seized from his person on\nNovember 4th, 2005, including a cell phone.\"      His affidavit in\nsupport of the motion states that, \"[o]n information and belief,\nthe government intends to use evidence seized from the property and\nfrom my person against me at trial.\"\n\n                                        -20-\n\fsearch of his homes on November 5. Exhibit 12 included information\n\nabout     the    1022   phone,    which   was    the    one   seized   incident   to\n\nJadlowe's arrest, and referred to a second phone with the number\n\n(508) 982-1964 (\"the           1964 phone\").      Phone records related to the\n\n1964 phone had been seized from Jadlowe's residence, but the court\n\nsuppressed them in ruling that the search of the homes was not\n\nsupported by probable cause.           Simmons testified, however, that the\n\ngovernment had relied on those improperly seized records concerning\n\nthe 1964 phone when it issued a single subpoena to Sprint for\n\ninformation about the two phone numbers.\n\n                It   appears     undisputed      that   the    government's    only\n\ninformation about the 1964 phone derived from the illegal search\n\nand, hence, no evidence about that phone number should have been\n\nadmitted at trial.         The information in Exhibit 12 about the 1022\n\nphone, however, derived from a court-authorized pen register of\n\nGonsalves's cell phone in August 2005 and, as such, was not a fruit\n\nof the illegal search of Jadlowe's home.23\n\n                Technically,     therefore,      Exhibit      12   contained   both\n\nadmissible and inadmissible evidence, and Jadlowe may be correct\n\nthat the court erred in allowing it into evidence.                     But any such\n\nerror was certainly harmless.              With respect to the 1964 phone,\n\n\n     23\n       The pen register identified a phone with an IMSI number –\nwhich is like a serial number – of 316010102274660. The Sprint\nrecords connected that IMSI number to the 1022 phone and to the\nphone's use as a Direct Connect device with the number\n183*913*2639.\n\n                                          -21-\n\fExhibit 12 says only that \"[n]o records were found . . . during the\n\nrequested time period.\" The bulk of the information on the exhibit\n\nrelates to the 1022 phone.      The document identifies the 1022\n\naccount holder as Marc Souza, whose listed date of birth is the\n\nsame as Jadlowe's.    That section of the document also links the\n\nIMSE number from the pen register with the 1022 phone seized from\n\nJadlowe, thereby linking him with intercepted calls to and from\n\nGonsalves and Ferreira.24   Hence, the damaging information in the\n\nexhibit was all lawfully derived.\n\n           Jadlowe attempts to sidestep this critical dichotomy\n\nbetween the admissible and inadmissible information in Exhibit 12\n\nby arguing that the document implicitly suggests that the two phone\n\nnumbers are linked.   Even if that were true, it would not matter.\n\nThe exhibit in effect said nothing about the 1964 number, there was\n\nno substantive testimony about it, and the government did not rely\n\non it.    We agree with the government that, even if admission of\n\nExhibit 12 were error, it did not influence the verdict and was\n\n\n\n     24\n        Each of the two sections of the document, which are\nseparated by a line of asterisks, begins with a listing of \"Request\nType,\" followed by the explanation \"Subscription Info (Basic).\"\nEach lists a \"Date Range\" and \"Subject Number.\" The top section\nidentifies the number as \"5089821964\" and the bottom section lists\n\"316010102274660\" as the number.      The top section then has a\nlisting for \"Comments,\" which is followed by the \"[n]o records were\nfound\" entry.     The bottom section lists an account number,\nsubscriber name, address, comments (the \"comment\" is that the\naccount was established in June 2005), and a variety of other\ninformation, including the full 1022 phone number and the Direct\nConnect number.\n\n                               -22-\n\ftherefore harmless.

Did Instructional Error Occur?\n\n          The   challenged   instruction   was   delivered   before   the\n\nopening statements as part of the court's explanation of how the\n\ncase would proceed:\n\n                 I just have a few special instructions\n          about your conduct as jurors. The first one\n          is the hardest. You are not to discuss the\n          case with each other or anyone else until you\n          retire to the jury room at the end of the case\n          to deliberate on your verdict.\n                 This rule is not as strict as it\n          sounds. When I say you are not to discuss the\n          case, I mean it in this sense. You are not to\n          express an ultimate opinion about the outcome\n          of the case.\n                 Personally, even this rule, the way I\n          state it, I don't think is a terribly good\n          rule. I understand the reason for it. The\n          thought is that because some of us tend to be\n          more opinionated and assertive than others,\n          jurors who are more assertive will tend to\n          influence the opinions of fellow jurors if\n          jurors are talking about the case before they\n          hear all of the evidence. I think this, in\n          fact, underestimates the intelligence of\n          almost all the jurors that I have worked with\n          over the years, but, nonetheless, this is the\n          federal rule. It's been abolished in a number\n          of states, but it is the federal rule. So we\n          have to respect it. Like I say, whether we\n          agree with the wisdom of a rule or not, it is\n          the rule, the rule we follow.\n                 But, again, don't over-interpret what I\n          said. Of course you'll talk about interesting\n          things that happened during the course of the\n          trial, idiosyncracies of the judge and the\n          lawyers, interesting things witnesses say,\n          significant pieces of evidence. Just do not\n          express an opinion about the case, again,\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\f          until you begin deliberations and each have an\n          opportunity to make your opinions known.\n\n          Jadlowe's counsel properly objected to the instruction,\n\narguing that \"it's inappropriate for the jurors to discuss the case\n\nin any way, shape, or form until all of the evidence is in, they've\n\nheard closing argument, and they'[v]e heard your Honor's charge.\"\n\nThe court disagreed:\n\n          No.   Human nature, if you tell them not to\n          discuss the case, defies anything we know\n          about human beings. What's important is that\n          they not form any ultimate opinions about the\n          case until they've heard all of the evidence\n          and that they not express opinions about the\n          resolution of the case to one another.    And\n          that's – if you want me to repeat the thrust\n          of that instruction again, I will, but that's\n          what I meant.\n\nDefense counsel then elaborated on his concern:\n\n                 Your honor, my objection is I don't\n          think   they    should   be   talking   about\n          \"interesting things that the witnesses said.\"\n          I just think that that's not what the jury\n          should be doing. They should be simply – they\n          can talk about the weather or the Red Sox.\n          They should not be talking about the case.\n\nThe court concluded the colloquy as follows:\n\n                 I disagree, and I think that's the\n          reason states, at least those who have a\n          progressive view of jury service, have\n          abolished that rule now. In fact, even as to\n          ultimate opinions as to the case, which I\n          restrict them from talking about. I think you\n          will find that the modern trend is against the\n          old-fashion rule.\n\n          The   court's   instruction   was   unmistakably   erroneous,\n\nincluding the assumption that the \"modern trend\" in criminal cases\n\n                                -25-\n\fis to allow juror discussion.

See Resko, 3 F.3d at 689; Winebrenner, 147\n\nF.2d at 328-29.           The court in Resko cogently summarized these\n\nconcerns in a criminal case:\n\n           First, since the prosecution presents its\n           evidence first, any premature discussions are\n           likely to occur before the defendant has a\n           chance to present all of his or her evidence,\n           and it is likely that any initial opinions\n           formed by the jurors, which will likely\n           influence other jurors, will be unfavorable to\n           the defendant for this reason. Second, once a\n           juror expresses his or her views in the\n           presence of other jurors, he or she is likely\n           to continue to adhere to that opinion and to\n           pay greater attention to evidence presented\n           that    comports     with    that     opinion.\n           Consequently,   the   mere   act   of   openly\n           expressing his or her views may tend to cause\n           the juror to approach the case with less than\n           a fully open mind and to adhere to the\n           publicly expressed viewpoint.\n\n           Third, the jury system is meant to involve\n           decisionmaking as a collective, deliberative\n           process   and  premature  discussions  among\n           individual jurors may thwart that goal.\n           Fourth, because the court provides the jury\n\n                                      -30-\n\f          with legal instructions only after all the\n          evidence has been presented, jurors who engage\n          in premature deliberations do so without the\n          benefit of the court's instructions on the\n          reasonable   doubt   standard.     Fifth,   if\n          premature deliberations occur before the\n          defendant has had an opportunity to present\n          all of his or her evidence . . . and jurors\n          form premature conclusions about the case, the\n          burden of proof will have been, in effect,\n          shifted from the government to the defendant,\n          who has \"the burden of changing by evidence\n          the opinion thus formed.\" [Winebrenner, 147\n          F.2d] at 328.30\n\n          Finally, requiring the jury to refrain from\n          prematurely discussing the case with fellow\n          jurors in a criminal case helps protect a\n          defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a fair\n          trial as well as his or her due process right\n          to place the burden on the government to prove\n          its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n3 F.3d at 689-90 (citations omitted).\n\n          To be sure, not all of these reasons have force when the\n\njurors are expressly told – as they are, for example, in Arizona –\n\nthat they may discuss the evidence only in the presence of all\n\njurors and that they must \"reserve judgment about the outcome of\n\nthe case until deliberations commence.\"   Ariz. R. Civ. P. 39(f).\n\n(Essentially, that is what the trial court told the jurors here.)\n\n\n     30\n        In this case, for example, Jadlowe points out that the\ngovernment introduced a number of audio recordings to prove his\ninvolvement in the drug conspiracy and that the jurors could have\nconcluded early in the case, after discussion among themselves,\nthat those tapes reflected his participation.    Defense counsel,\nhowever, later sought to give those cryptic conversations a more\nbenign interpretation by introducing other audio recordings\nindicating that Ferreira and Gonsalves were involved in various\nconstruction projects with the speaker believed to be Jadlowe and\nthat furniture was being stored in the garage.\n\n                              -31-\n\fYet, impressions formed about the evidence early on may nonetheless\n\nhave a significant impact on the verdict, even if the jurors do not\n\nmake their ultimate judgment until the end of the case.                         In our\n\nview, the traditional rationales remain persuasive.\n\n             Of course, not all premature jury discussion about a case\n\nwill compromise a defendant's fair trial rights, particularly where\n\nthe conversation does not reflect a point of view about the\n\nevidence or the outcome.

The Court explained\n\nthat characteristic of structural error in Gonzalez-Lopez, where it\n\ncontrasted denial of a criminal defendant's choice of counsel –\n\nwhich it held to be structural error – with denial of the Sixth\n\nAmendment right to effective representation of counsel – which\n\nrequires an additional showing of prejudice.

If the court's faulty instruction results in early\n\ndiscussion of the evidence or witnesses by the jurors, their later\n\ndeliberations may be prejudiced in ways that would be difficult to\n\nidentify or quantify.             The jury's deliberative process – the\n\ncollective, objective review of the evidence of record, evaluated\n\nas a whole, and guided by the court's closing instructions – may be\n\ncompromised as a result of prematurely formed impressions.                      That\n\npotential harm is unlike the erroneous introduction of a piece of\n\nevidence or a flawed instruction that misstates or omits an element\n\nof the crime.       Such errors are discrete trial events whose effect\n\non the outcome of the trial may be evaluated in light of the\n\nproperly admitted evidence or the instruction as a whole.                         By\n\ncontrast, premature discussion raises the possibility that the\n\njurors will view all of the evidence through a distorted lens, much\n\nlike   what    occurs      when   the   jury     is   improperly   instructed     on\n\nreasonable doubt.          See Neder, 527 U.S. at 10-11 (noting that a\n\nflawed reasonable doubt instruction is \"not subject to harmless-\n\n\n                                          -35-\n\ferror analysis because it 'vitiates all the jury's findings'\"\n\n(quoting Sullivan, 508 U.S. at 281)). Where the possibility exists\n\nthat premature jury discussions shifted to the defendant \"the\n\nburden    of     changing    by   evidence   the    opinion    thus     formed,\"\n\nWinebrenner, 147 F.2d at 328, the possibility exists that the trial\n\nwas \"an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence,\"\n\nNeder, 527 U.S. at 9.\n\n            Yet, the error here differs in a significant way from\n\nthose the Supreme Court has labeled structural.                   Although the\n\ninstruction opens the door to discussion \"taint[ing] the process by\n\nwhich    guilt    [is]    determined,\"   Curbelo,    343   F.3d   at   285,   the\n\ndefendant will not necessarily be denied a fair trial as a result\n\nof the error.       Despite the instruction, juror discussion may not\n\ntake place at all, and even if some preliminary conversation about\n\nthe case occurs, it may be tangential to the jurors' determination\n\nof guilt or innocence.        Unlike the complete denial of counsel or a\n\npublic    trial,    for   example,   the   harm    triggered   by   the   flawed\n\ninstruction does not occur – i.e., the constitutional violation is\n\nnot \"complete\" – until prejudicial discussion occurs.                  It is not\n\nnecessarily the case, therefore, that \"all or almost all such\n\nerrors always 'affec[t] the framework within which the trial\n\nproceeds,' or 'necessarily render a criminal trial fundamentally\n\nunfair.'\" Marcus, 130 S. Ct. at 2166 (quoting Fulminante, 499 U.S.\n\nat 310, and Neder, 527 U.S. at 9).\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\f             Jadlowe contends that the error must nonetheless be\n\nconsidered structural because a defendant would never be able to\n\nprobe the jury's deliberations to prove prejudice.         Inquiries into\n\njury deliberations are, in fact, narrowly restricted by Federal\n\nRule of Evidence 606(b), which bars juror testimony \"as to any\n\nmatter or statement occurring during the course of the jury's\n\ndeliberations.\"      The relevant inquiry, however, is not into the\n\nnature   of    the   formal   deliberations   that    occurred   once    the\n\npresentation of evidence concluded, but the nature of any juror\n\ndiscussion about the case prior to the formal deliberations.\n\nProbing such premature discussions is neither impermissible nor\n\nimpossible.    Indeed, courts routinely examine allegations of juror\n\nmisconduct      involving     improper     external     influences       and\n\ncommunications among jurors, and we see no relevant distinction\n\nbetween those contexts and this one.       The threshold question would\n\nbe whether any premature discussion took place.            If so, was it\n\namong all jurors or just a few?          Did discussion occur regularly\n\nthrough the proceedings, or only once – and at what point?               What\n\nwas the content of the discussion?\n\n             We thus conclude that Supreme Court precedent \"insist[s]\n\nupon a showing of individual prejudice\" when a court improperly\n\ninstructs jurors in a criminal case that they may discuss the\n\nevidence before formal deliberations commence.         Marcus, 130 S. Ct.\n\nat   2166.     Indeed,   although   the    practice   remains    rare,   the\n\n\n                                    -37-\n\fauthorization of jury discussion in criminal cases by some courts\n\nand the Arizona Supreme Court Committee's recommendation that it be\n\npermitted     in   both   civil     and    criminal    trials   reinforce    our\n\nconclusion that the instruction here should not be classified as\n\nstructural error requiring automatic reversal of the defendant's\n\nconviction.

Such an inquiry could have revealed that the jurors\n\ndiscussed only tangential matters, allowing the government to\n\neasily satisfy its burden to show an absence of prejudice from the\n\ncourt's erroneous instruction.              In some cases, such an inquiry\n\ncould produce evidence that would advance the defendant's claim of\n\nprejudicial error. Given the potential significance of the jurors'\n\nactual response to an instruction allowing them to converse about\n\nthe trial as it unfolds, both the prosecutor and defense counsel\n\nwould be well advised to request a jury inquiry whenever a court\n\ngives an instruction like the one challenged in this case.\n\n              Here, the record is silent on whether the jurors engaged\n\nin premature discussions of the case and, hence, we must resolve\n\nthe   issue    of   prejudice      by   examining   the   information     that   is\n\navailable to us.

We thus presume that the jurors did\n\nnot express opinions about Jadlowe's guilt or innocence.\n\n            The court, however, told the jurors they could discuss\n\n\"idiosyncracies of the judge and the lawyers, interesting things\n\nwitnesses say, significant pieces of evidence.\" Thus, in assessing\n\nthe impact of the court's error, the question is whether we can say\n\nwith assurance that, even if discussion of those matters occurred,\n\nthe jury's deliberative process was not compromised.              Our concern\n\nis    whether   the    jurors   were   able   to   objectively   evaluate   the\n\nevidence as a whole when they engaged in formal deliberations,\n\nguided by the court's closing instructions.             See Resko, 3 F.3d at\n\n692    (focusing on the loss of \"the jurors' impartiality\" as the\n\nprejudice from an instruction allowing premature deliberations);\n\nWinebrenner,     147    F.2d    at   327   (\"Whether   guilty    or   innocent,\n\nappellants were entitled under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to\n\nthe Constitution to a fair trial to an impartial jury.\"); id. at\n\n330 (referring to the \"right of the defendants to open minded\n\ndeliberation\") (Woodrough, J., dissenting).\n\n            We can easily discount the impact of any discussion about\n\nidiosyncrasies of the personnel.           Such observations would have had\n\nlittle or no effect on the jurors' ability to dispassionately\n\n\n                                       -40-\n\fconsider        the    evidence   against      Jadlowe       in   its   entirety.     We\n\nacknowledge, however, that the possible discussion of \"significant\n\npieces of evidence\" or interesting testimony is more troubling.\n\nSuch premature evidentiary deliberation could, in close cases, skew\n\nthe final weighing of all the evidence.                      This is not, however, a\n\nclose case.            Video surveillance and audiotapes, bolstered by\n\ncompelling circumstantial evidence, placed Jadlowe in the midst of\n\na drug scheme that involved the temporary storage of ten kilograms\n\nof cocaine in his garage.                    Despite flaws in the way certain\n\nevidence was presented, the record leaves no doubt about Jadlowe's\n\ncomplicity in the drug conspiracy.\n\n                Thus, even if we assume that some jurors talked too soon\n\nabout the inculpatory tendency of certain evidence, the force of\n\nthe government's case as a whole meant that any comments made\n\nduring the course of the proceedings almost certainly had no\n\ninfluence on the jurors' ultimate evaluation of Jadlowe's guilt or\n\ninnocence.            Inescapably, the possibility of taint to the jury\n\nprocess        from     conversations         about     particular         evidence   was\n\ndiminished, if not entirely negated, by the overwhelming proof of\n\nguilt        that   confronted    the    jurors       when   they   commenced      formal\n\ndeliberations.32           Because      we    are   persuaded       that    the   court's\n\n\n        32\n       We emphasize that we consider the strength of the evidence\nin this context not to demonstrate that the evidence was sufficient\nto establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but as part of our\ninquiry into whether premature discussion could have compromised\nthe jury's deliberative process.

Diaz, 597 F.3d at 64.\n\nA. The Summary Chart\n\n            Jadlowe argues that Government Exhibit 10, a six-column\n\nchart listing details for twenty-two of the intercepted phone\n\ncalls, contained testimonial hearsay that should have been ruled\n\ninadmissible at trial.           Specifically, he objects to the final\n\ncolumn on the chart, which identifies the other phone number\n\n\n\n\ncould occur even in the face of powerful evidence of guilt. The\njury process almost certainly would be tainted, for example, by an\ninstruction allowing discussion of the ultimate issue of guilt\nbefore all of the evidence was presented, regardless of the\nstrength of the government's case.\n\n                                         -42-\n\finvolved in each of the listed wiretapped conversations.33   Eleven\n\nof the twenty-two calls were made to or from a number associated\n\nwith the 1022 phone seized from Jadlowe.   There is no dispute about\n\nthe admissibility of the first five columns, which report, inter\n\nalia, the date and time of each call and which targeted phone\n\nnumber, Ferreira's or Gonzalves's, was involved.   That information\n\nalso was listed on a computerized printout labeled as Exhibit 9,\n\nwhich Jadlowe concedes was properly admitted.\n\n          The information in Column 6 did not appear in written\n\nform on any other document admitted into evidence, and Jadlowe\n\ncorrectly points out that there is no evidence in the record about\n\nthe creation of Column 6.   The government argues that Column 6 was\n\nadmissible because the same information was contained in digital\n\nfiles that were part of Exhibit 8.     Exhibit 8 is a compact disk\n\n(\"CD\") that contains the oral recordings of the twenty-two phone\n\ncalls listed on Exhibit 10; according to the government, the Column\n\n6 information for each call is appended to its oral recording on\n\nthe CD.   The testimony at trial indicated that the data on the CD\n\nwas not accessible to the jurors, however, and the government at\n\noral argument essentially confirmed that was so.34\n\n\n     33\n       Column 6, labeled \"Direction of Call/Phone No.\" also states\nwhether the call was incoming or outgoing.\n     34\n        In its brief, the government describes Exhibit 9 as \"a\ncomputer-generated print-out of some of the embedded data from\nth[e] calls.\"   The record does not reveal whether the Column 6\ninformation could have been retrieved in a similar format or how\n\n                                -43-\n\f          Given the government's concession, we think there is\n\nforce to the argument that Column 6 did not qualify as a summary of\n\nevidence already in the record.    We nonetheless decline to probe\n\nother theories in support of its admission. Column 6 provided only\n\none link between Jadlowe and the conspiracy by identifying the 1022\n\nnumber as the other phone number in some of the intercepted calls.\n\nAs we describe below in Section B, the audio and video surveillance\n\nproduced much more direct evidence of Jadlowe's participation in\n\nthe calls.35    Hence, any error in allowing the list into evidence\n\nwas harmless.\n\nB. The Remaining Evidentiary Issues\n\n          Jadlowe's three remaining contentions all concern the\n\nways in which he was identified at trial as the individual who made\n\nthe arrangements with Gonsalves and Ferreira for the cocaine\n\ndelivery at 30 Arch Street.     Agent Fallon identified him in the\n\nsurveillance videotape shown at trial by comparing a photograph of\n\nhim to the video image.    Agent Simmons identified a voice on the\n\ntapes of the wiretapped phone calls as Jadlowe's, even though he\n\n\neasy it would be to do so.\n     35\n        Exhibit 10's relative unimportance to the case is reflected\nin a colloquy that took place at the close of evidence.        When\ndefense counsel renewed the objection to Exhibit 10, the district\ncourt commented that it did not view the document \"as being a very\ncritical piece of evidence linking anything to anything.\"       The\nprosecutor agreed and stated that he would not object to its being\nredacted or excluded.    The court said it would make a decision\nafter reviewing Agent Fallon's testimony and, later that day, ruled\nthe exhibit admissible without restriction.\n\n                                -44-\n\fhad never spoken with Jadlowe in person; the transcripts of the\n\nwiretapped conversations given to the jury reflected Simmons's\n\nidentification of Jadlowe as one of the speakers.\n\n          Jadlowe argues that the visual and voice identifications\n\nconstituted   improper    lay   opinion    testimony   because   neither\n\nofficer's identification was based on prior personal experience\n\nwith Jadlowe and \"[t]he jury was perfectly capable of drawing its\n\nown independent conclusion[s] based on the evidence presented.\"\n\nUnited States v. Garcia-Ortiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203370\"><a href=\"/opinion/203370/united-states-v-garcia-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80 (1st Cir. 2008); see\n\nalso Fed. R. Evid. 701 (allowing lay opinion testimony if, inter\n\nalia, it is \"rationally based on the perception of the witness\" and\n\n\"helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the\n\ndetermination of a fact in issue\").        He asserts that the district\n\ncourt also abused its discretion in allowing the government to\n\nprovide the jury with transcripts that presented as fact that he\n\nwas the speaker.\n\n          We agree that the officers' identifications should not\n\nhave been allowed as lay opinion testimony because neither Fallon\n\nnor Simmons was in a better position than the jurors to make the\n\nidentity judgments.      Indeed, Fallon testified that she made the\n\nidentification by comparing his image on the screen with a driver's\n\nlicense photo that was in evidence.       We are at a loss to understand\n\nthe government's argument that Fallon was better situated than the\n\njurors simply because she was watching the events as they were\n\n\n                                  -45-\n\foccurring.    At the time, she was looking at the same video image\n\nseen by the jurors at trial; the Registry of Motor Vehicle's\n\nphotograph also was in evidence.36          In addition, although the\n\ngovernment is correct that \"identification of a telephone caller\n\nmay be [established] by circumstantial evidence,\" United States v.\n\nDiMuro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"338494\"><a href=\"/opinion/338494/united-states-v-jerome-dimuro-united-states-of-america-v-roland-lung/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 514 (1st Cir. 1976) (quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted) (alteration in original), the circumstantial\n\nevidence on which Simmons relied to infer that Jadlowe was the\n\nspeaker in the wiretapped conversations – the content of the calls\n\nand the physical surveillance reports – also was available to the\n\njury.\n\n            Nonetheless,     any   error   in   allowing   the   officers'\n\nidentifications   or   the   related   transcripts   was   unquestionably\n\nharmless.     An abundance of circumstantial evidence pointed to\n\nJadlowe as the individual whom Fallon saw clearing the garage at 30\n\nArch Street and whom Simmons heard in the phone conversations with\n\nFerreira and Gonsalves.\n\n            In a phone conversation on October 8, for example, the\n\ncaller whose voice Simmons identified as Jadlowe's reported to\n\nGonsalves that he would be getting his hair braided and that he had\n\nbeen home all day on his birthday.         Both items of information in\n\n\n     36\n       Fallon also testified that her       identification was aided by\ninformation from other officers on          the scene confirming that\nJadlowe was the person she was seeing        on the video screen. That\nreliance on others further diminishes       the foundation for her own\nidentification.\n\n                                    -46-\n\fthe call were linked to Jadlowe.              According to motor vehicle\n\nrecords, Jadlowe's birthday was the day before, October 7, and\n\nSimmons, who had seen Jadlowe multiple times before, testified that\n\nhe   saw   Jadlowe   with   newly   braided    hair   shortly   after   this\n\nconversation.    In a call with Gonsalves on November 4, the speaker\n\nSimmons identified as Jadlowe was addressed as \"Uncle Marc,\" and in\n\nanother call the same day, just before 2 p.m., that speaker told\n\nGonsalves that he was \"[t]aking care of the garage\" and that he was\n\n\"[d]oin' it right now.\"     According to Agent Fallon's testimony, it\n\nwas at about that time that, with other officers' assistance, she\n\nidentified Jadlowe as the individual she had seen moving items from\n\nthe garage to the yard at 30 Arch Street.\n\n            Simmons's ability to identify Jadlowe in each instance in\n\nwhich Jadlowe was designated on the transcript as the speaker was\n\nsupported by the agent's admissible testimony that he had listened\n\nto 25 to 50 calls involving the number associated with the phone\n\nseized from Jadlowe at 30 Arch Street on November 4, 2005, and that\n\nover time he was able to recognize the callers in those wiretapped\n\nconversations after \"hearing the same voices every day.\"                 He\n\ntestified that he had heard no one on that phone           other than the\n\nspeaker Gonsalves referred to as \"Uncle Marc\" in the November 4\n\ncall.   Each of the calls attributed to Jadlowe was thus identified\n\nby Simmons as involving the same voice, including the other calls\n\ndescribed above whose content was linked to Jadlowe.\n\n\n                                    -47-\n\f             Hence, even if it were improper for Simmons and Fallon to\n\nhave offered their opinions that Jadlowe was the speaker in the\n\nwiretapped calls and the individual in the videotape, we are\n\nconfident that any such error did not influence the verdict.              This\n\nis equally true of the jury's exposure to the transcripts.                Not\n\nonly was there compelling circumstantial evidence that Jadlowe was\n\nproperly identified as the speaker in the calls, but the district\n\ncourt also instructed the jurors at the time they received the\n\ntranscripts that it was up to them \"to make a determination as to\n\nwhether the transcript is correct in its identification of Mr.\n\nJadlowe as the speaker at the points at which he is so listed in\n\nthe transcript.\"       The court emphasized that \"the transcript is\n\nonly an aid,\" and that the jurors would \"have to look to other\n\nevidence in the case to ensure yourself that that indeed is true.\"\n\nThe court repeated that caution in its charge at the close of\n\nevidence, telling the jurors that if they \"believe that the speaker\n\nhas   been   wrongly   identified,    keep   in   mind   that   it   is   your\n\nunderstanding of the recording that matters.\"\n\n             On this record, there was no reversible error stemming\n\nfrom the challenged evidentiary rulings.\n\n                                      V.\n\n             Jadlowe has pressed serious concerns about the admission\n\nof evidence and the jury instructions, and on some of those issues\n\nwe agree that the district court erred.           On the record before us,\n\n\n                                     -48-\n\fhowever, we cannot agree that those errors require a new trial.\n\nThe judgment of conviction is therefore affirmed.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -49-\n\f</pre>",
