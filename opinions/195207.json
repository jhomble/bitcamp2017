Defendant-appellant Victor\n                                   \n\nFeliz-Cuevas (\"Feliz\") was indicted in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts for unlawful reentry into\n\nthe United States following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C.\n\n   1326.    Feliz pleaded  guilty  to  the  indictment.   At  the\n\nsentencing hearing, Feliz moved for a downward departure from the\n\napplicable  sentencing guideline range,  which was denied  by the\n\ndistrict court.  Smith now appeals this denial.  We affirm.\n\n                            I.  FACTS\n\n          On February 7, 1992, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (\"INS\") ordered Feliz deported to the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn February 11, 1992, immigration officials gave Feliz INS Form  \n\nI-294, which advised Feliz that: \n\n            any deported person who within five years\n            returns without permission is guilty of a\n            felony.   If convicted he may be punished\n            by imprisonment  of  not  more  than  two\n            years  and/or a  fine  of  not more  than\n            $1,000.00.\n\nFeliz  read and signed  the document,  acknowledging that  he had\n\nreceived it.\n\n          INS Form I-294  only set forth the  penalties generally\n\napplicable to  a violation of 8 U.S.C.    1326, but did not state\n\nthe  more severe  penalties  that applied  to  aliens, who,  like\n\nFeliz, had been convicted of an aggravated felony.  In fact,  the\n\npenalty which  Feliz would face  if he illegally returned  to the\n\nUnited States  without permission was  imprisonment for up  to 15\n\nyears.\n\n          Feliz  then   reentered  the  United  States   and  was\n\n                               -2-\n                                2\n\narrested.   On  October  23,  1992, the  grand  jury returned  an\n\nindictment charging Feliz with a violation of 8 U.S.C.    1326(a)\n\nand 1326(b)(2),  illegal reentry after deportation  subsequent to\n\nbeing convicted of an aggravated felony.  Feliz pleaded guilty on\n\nMarch 16, 1993.\n\n          With  respect to sentencing, Feliz moved for a downward\n\ndeparture  from   the  applicable  sentencing   guideline  range,\n\ncontending  that  a  mitigating  circumstance  warranted  such  a\n\ndeparture.  Feliz  submitted an affidavit which stated  that as a\n\nresult of  the INS giving  him Form  I-294, he believed  that the\n\nmaximum  penalty for reentering the United  States was two years'\n\nimprisonment; that he  did not know that the  maximum penalty was\n\nfifteen years'  imprisonment;  and that,  had he  known that,  he\n\nwould not have returned to the United States.\n\n            At the sentencing on May 26, 1993, the district court\n\nheld an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Feliz had relied\n\non  INS Form I-294  when he decided  to return unlawfully  to the\n\ncountry.  Feliz testified that he relied  on the INS form for his\n\nbelief that he faced no  more than two years' imprisonment if  he\n\nreentered the United States.   Feliz also testified that he would\n\nnot have  returned to  the United  States had  he known  that the\n\nmaximum penalty he would face was 15 years, or that the guideline\n\nsentencing  range was  46-57 months.   The district  court denied\n\nFeliz's motion for  a downward departure and sentenced  him to 46\n\nmonths in prison.\n\n                         II.  SENTENCING\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\n          Feliz  challenges the  district court's  denial  of his\n\nmotion for  a downward departure  from the  sentencing range  set\n\nforth in the Sentencing Guidelines.   Feliz argues that by virtue\n\nof INS Form I-294, the government erroneously informed him of the\n\nconsequences  of  returning  unlawfully to  the  country.   Smith\n\nsubmitted an affidavit and testified  that he relied upon the INS\n\nform when he decided  to return to the United States.  Therefore,\n\nFeliz contends  that this  constituted a mitigating  circumstance\n\nthat the Sentencing Commission had not taken into account when it\n\nformulated the guidelines, and it warranted a downward departure.\n\nFeliz argues that  the district court erroneously  concluded that\n\nit lacked  the  legal  authority to  depart  from  the  guideline\n\nsentencing range based on the INS notice.\n\n          The   government  argues   that   the  district   court\n\nunderstood  that it  had the  power to  consider whether  the INS\n\nnotice  provided a  ground  for  departure  from  the  Sentencing\n\nGuidelines, but it  refused to exercise its  discretion to depart\n\ndownward.\n\n          Generally, a  district  court's decision  to refuse  to\n\nexercise  its discretion to  depart downward from  the sentencing\n\nguidelines is  not appealable.   United States v. Smith,  No. 93-\n                                                       \n\n1722, slip  op. at 10  (1st Cir.  Jan. 28,  1994) (citing  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Lombardi,  5 F.3d  568,  571 (1st  Cir. 1993);  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Rushby,  936 F.2d 41, 42 (1st Cir.  1991)).  \"Appellate\n                \n\njurisdiction  may  attach, however,  where  the  district court's\n\ndecision not to depart is based on the court's view that it lacks\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\nthe legal authority to consider a departure.\"  Smith, slip op. at\n                                                    \n\n10.\n\n          As a preliminary matter, the record seemingly indicates\n\nthat the district court concluded  as a factual matter that Feliz\n\ndid not  rely on the  INS notice when  he decided to  reenter the\n\nUnited   States.1    Moreover,  the  record  indicates  that  the\n\ndistrict  court  did  not  believe  that this  was  the  kind  of\n\ncircumstance  that justified  a downward  departure.   Thus,  the\n\ndistrict  court  refused  to exercise  its  discretion  to depart\n\ndownward, and this decision is not appealable.\n\n          The record, however, could also be read to  support the\n\nconclusion that the  district court believed  that it lacked  the\n\nlegal authority to  depart under the Guidelines based  on the INS\n\nnotice.  We will  therefore review the district court's  decision\n\nin light of Smith, No. 93-1722 (1st Cir. Jan. 28, 1994), where we\n                 \n\nrecently considered this precise issue.\n\n          In Smith,  we stated that  we did not believe  that the\n                  \n\nSentencing Commission considered  an unusual  situation like  the\n\nINS  giving  an  individual  being  deported  Form  I-294,  which\n\nmisstated  the  penalty  for  reentry,  when  it  formulated  its\n\nguidelines.  Id.  at ll.  We found, however,  that this situation\n               \n\n                    \n\n1   Feliz also argues that the district court's denial of Feliz's\nmotion for  a downward  departure resulted from  an error  of law\nregarding the standard  to be used  in determining whether  Feliz\nreasonably relied upon INS Form I-294.  Feliz' estoppel argument,\nwhich  involves the  question  of  whether  Feliz'  reliance  was\nreasonable,  is inconsequential  in light  of  our decision  that\nFeliz'  reliance  on  Form  I-294  was simply  not  the  kind  of\ncircumstance that could warrant a downward departure.\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\ndid  not present  the  kind of  circumstance  a sentencing  court\n\nshould  consider to support a downward  departure, because it was\n\nantithetical  to the purposes of  the sentencing system, which is\n\nto  deter criminal  conduct.   Id.  at 11-12.    Feliz, like  the\n                                 \n\ndefendant in  Smith,  implicitly admitted  that he  intentionally\n                   \n\ncommitted a felony.\n\n            The sentencing  court cannot  countenance\n            [the defendant's] purposeful  decision to\n            engage  in felonious  conduct, and  grant\n            him the benefit  of a downward departure,\n            because  [the  defendant]  understood the\n            penalty he  would face  to be  relatively\n            minor.  Rather,  the sentencing court was\n            required  to  sentence   [the  defendant]\n            within the  applicable sentencing  range,\n            so that [the  defendant] and others would\n            be deterred from illegally reentering the\n            country in the future.\n\nId.  at 12.   Therefore,  the district  court's denial  of Feliz'\n  \n\nmotion for a  downward departure was proper, and  its decision is\n\naffirmed.   \n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n",

Sec. 1326.  Feliz pleaded guilty to the indictment.  At the sentencing hearing, Feliz moved for a downward departure from the applicable sentencing guideline range, which was denied by the district court.  Smith now appeals this denial.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 7, 1992, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") ordered Feliz deported to the Dominican Republic.  On February 11, 1992, immigration officials gave Feliz INS Form I-294, which advised Feliz that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>any deported person who within five years returns without permission is guilty of a felony.  If convicted he may be punished by imprisonment of not more than two years and/or a fine of not more than $1,000.00.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feliz read and signed the document, acknowledging that he had received it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">INS Form I-294 only set forth the penalties generally applicable to a violation of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, but did not state the more severe penalties that applied to aliens, who, like Feliz, had been convicted of an aggravated felony.  In fact, the penalty which Feliz would face if he illegally returned to the United States without permission was imprisonment for up to 15 years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feliz then reentered the United States and was arrested.  On October 23, 1992, the grand jury returned an indictment charging Feliz with a violation of 8 U.S.C. Secs. 1326(a) and 1326(b)(2), illegal reentry after deportation subsequent to being convicted of an aggravated felony.  Feliz pleaded guilty on March 16, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to sentencing, Feliz moved for a downward departure from the applicable sentencing guideline range, contending that a mitigating circumstance warranted such a departure.  Feliz submitted an affidavit which stated that as a result of the INS giving him Form I-294, he believed that the maximum penalty for reentering the United States was two years' imprisonment;  that he did not know that the maximum penalty was fifteen years' imprisonment;  and that, had he known that, he would not have returned to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing on May 26, 1993, the district court held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Feliz had relied on INS Form I-294 when he decided to return unlawfully to the country.  Feliz testified that he relied on the INS form for his belief that he faced no more than two years' imprisonment if he reentered the United States.  Feliz also testified that he would not have returned to the United States had he known that the maximum penalty he would face was 15 years, or that the guideline sentencing range was 46-57 months.  The district court denied Feliz's motion for a downward departure and sentenced him to 46 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. SENTENCING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feliz challenges the district court's denial of his motion for a downward departure from the sentencing range set forth in the Sentencing Guidelines.  Feliz argues that by virtue of INS Form I-294, the government erroneously informed him of the consequences of returning unlawfully to the country.  Smith submitted an affidavit and testified that he relied upon the INS form when he decided to return to the United States.  Therefore, Feliz contends that this constituted a mitigating circumstance that the Sentencing Commission had not taken into account when it formulated the guidelines, and it warranted a downward departure.  Feliz argues that the district court erroneously concluded that it lacked the legal authority to depart from the guideline sentencing range based on the INS notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the district court understood that it had the power to consider whether the INS notice provided a ground for departure from the Sentencing Guidelines, but it refused to exercise its discretion to depart downward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, a district court's decision to refuse to exercise its discretion to depart downward from the sentencing guidelines is not appealable.  United States v. Smith, No. 93-1722, slip op. at 10 (1st Cir.  Jan. 28, 1994) (citing  United States v. Lombardi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194934\"><a href=\"/opinion/194934/united-states-v-lombardi/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, 571 (1st Cir. 1993);   United States v. Rushby, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563223\"><a href=\"/opinion/563223/united-states-v-john-rushby/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir. 1991)).  \"Appellate jurisdiction may attach, however, where the district court's decision not to depart is based on the court's view that it lacks the legal authority to consider a departure.\"  Smith, slip op. at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter, the record seemingly indicates that the district court concluded as a factual matter that Feliz did not rely on the INS notice when he decided to reenter the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Moreover, the record indicates that the district court did not believe that this was the kind of circumstance that justified a downward departure.  Thus, the district court refused to exercise its discretion to depart downward, and this decision is not appealable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record, however, could also be read to support the conclusion that the district court believed that it lacked the legal authority to depart under the Guidelines based on the INS notice.  We will therefore review the district court's decision in light of Smith, No. 93-1722 (1st Cir.  Jan. 28, 1994), where we recently considered this precise issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Smith, we stated that we did not believe that the Sentencing Commission considered an unusual situation like the INS giving an individual being deported Form I-294, which misstated the penalty for reentry, when it formulated its guidelines.  Id. at ll.  We found, however, that this situation did not present the kind of circumstance a sentencing court should consider to support a downward departure, because it was antithetical to the purposes of the sentencing system, which is to deter criminal conduct.  Id. at 11-12.  Feliz, like the defendant in Smith, implicitly admitted that he intentionally committed a felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>The sentencing court cannot countenance [the defendant's] purposeful decision to engage in felonious conduct, and grant him the benefit of a downward departure, because [the defendant] understood the penalty he would face to be relatively minor.  Rather, the sentencing court was required to sentence [the defendant] within the applicable sentencing range, so that [the defendant] and others would be deterred from illegally reentering the country in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 12.  Therefore, the district court's denial of Feliz' motion for a downward departure was proper, and its decision is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Feliz also argues that the district court's denial of Feliz's motion for a downward departure resulted from an error of law regarding the standard to be used in determining whether Feliz reasonably relied upon INS Form I-294.  Feliz' estoppel argument, which involves the question of whether Feliz' reliance was reasonable, is inconsequential in light of our decision that Feliz' reliance on Form I-294 was simply not the kind of circumstance that could warrant a downward departure</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
