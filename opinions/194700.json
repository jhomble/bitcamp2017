Gustavo  Alberto Camacho-Carbono\n                     \n\nappeals the denial  of his  motion to set  aside, vacate,  or\n\ncorrect his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   2255.  We affirm\n\nthe district court's decision dismissing his petition. \n\n          Appellant was  found to  be in possession  of three\n\nkilograms of  cocaine at  the Luis Munoz  Marin International\n\nAirport  when  his  airline  flight, en  route  from  Bogota,\n\nColombia to  Madrid,  Spain, made  a  stopover in  San  Juan,\n\nPuerto  Rico.  He  was arrested and charged  in a three count\n\nindictment  with (1)  knowingly  importing cocaine  into  the\n\ncustoms territory of  the United States from a  place outside\n\nthereof in  violation of 21  U.S.C.   952(a);  (2) possession\n\nwith intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.  \n\n841(a)(1); and (3) possession of cocaine on board an aircraft\n\narriving in the customs territory of the United States, which\n\ndrug was  not part  of the cargo  entered in the  manifest or\n\npart of the official supplies  of the aircraft, in  violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C.   955.\n\n          After  pre-trial  discovery,  appellant  agreed  to\n\nplead guilty to Count Three, violation of 21 U.S.C.   955, in\n\nexchange  for which  the government  dismissed the  other two\n\ncounts.   The plea agreement  signed by appellant  on May 16,\n\n1989, shows  that appellant  then understood that  his guilty\n\nplea   meant  that  he  would  be  sentenced  to  a  term  of\n\nimprisonment of not less than five nor more than forty years,\n\n                             -2-\n\nsupervised release of four years and a possible fine of up to\n\ntwo million dollars.    On September 5, 1989,  petitioner was\n\nsentenced  to sixty-three  months  incarceration, four  years\n\nsupervised  release,  and a  special  monetary assessment  of\n\n$50.00.  No appeal was taken.   The instant   2255  petition,\n\nwhich we construe, in  part, as an attack on his  guilty plea\n\nas not knowing  and voluntary,  was filed on  June 10,  1992.\n\nAfter consideration  of the  motion papers and  exhibits, the\n\ndistrict court  denied the petition for reasons stated in its\n\norder of August 6, 1992.  This appeal followed.\n\n          Appellant  argues that  his sentence should  be set\n\naside  because his flight was bound for Spain, not the United\n\nStates.   He suggests  that  he was  not  in control  of  the\n\nplane's  flight path and implies  that he was  not aware that\n\nthe plane would stop in San Juan. \n\n           As  appellant now sees  it, these facts inevitably\n\nlead  to two  conclusions.   First, he  now believes  that he\n\ncould not  have been lawfully  convicted under the  first two\n\ncounts  of the indictment and should have been so informed by\n\neither the prosecutor  and/or his own counsel prior  to entry\n\nof  his guilty plea to  Count Three.   Second, he argues that\n\nhis  own  lack  of  control  over,  and  awareness  of,   the\n\nairplane's  stopover  in San  Juan  proves  that he  was  not\n\n\"voluntarily\" in the United  States and therefore not subject\n\nto conviction under Count Three.\n\n                             -3-\n\n          Appellant's   first  conclusion   is  based   on  a\n\nmisapprehension  of the  law.   See  United States  v. Gomez-\n                                                             \n\nVillamizar,  981 F.2d  621,  624 (1st  Cir.  1992) (under  21\n          \n\nU.S.C.   841(a) the government need not prove that  defendant\n\nhad the intent to distribute drugs in the United States, only\n\npossession  in  the United  States  and  facts sufficient  to\n\npermit  an inference  of  intention to  distribute);   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Ocampo-Guarin, 968 F.2d 1406 (1st Cir. 1992) (it is\n                       \n\nnot necessary  to establish that the defendant was aware that\n\nhis  flight would stop in the United States in order to prove\n\na violation of 21 U.S.C.   952(a)). \n\n          Appellant's second  conclusion is  also based on  a\n\nmisapprehension of the law.  While he \"attempts to dress[] it\n\nin   jurisdictional   clothing,\"   the   argument    is   not\n\ndistinguishable from that rejected  in earlier cases.  Gomez-\n                                                             \n\nVillamizar, 981  F.2d at 621; United  States v. Bernal-Rojas,\n                                                            \n\n933 F.2d 97  (1st Cir.  1991).  Regardless  of a  defendant's\n\ncontrol or  knowledge of  an aircraft's rescheduled  path, so\n\nlong as the  defendant made  a free and  voluntary choice  to\n\nboard  an aircraft which landed  in Puerto Rico,  there is no\n\nbar to a conviction under 21 U.S.C.   955.  Bernal-Rojas, 933\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 101.1    \n\n                    \n\n1.  In support of his argument, appellant has appended to his\nbrief  a July 21, 1992  decision of the  Board of Immigration\nAppeals  [\"BIA\"]  in his  deportation  case.   That  separate\nproceeding  involves different  legal  issues which  are  not\nbefore  us.   Moreover, appellant  misplaces reliance  on the\n\n                             -4-\n\n          Appellant's final contention that he was denied the\n\neffective  assistance of counsel is belied by his own written\n\nstatements   at  the   time,  expressing   satisfaction  with\n\ncounsel's performance,  and the  district  court's report  of\n\nsimilar  statements at  the \"change  of plea\"  hearing.   See\n                                                             \n\nBlackledge  v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63,  74 n.4 (1977) (district\n                      \n\ncourt   may   rely   on  its   recollection   of   sentencing\n\nproceedings).      Appellant's   current  reconstruction   of\n\ncounsel's alleged  faults falls  short of meeting  the burden\n\nappellant bears  of demonstrating that  the district  court's\n\ndetermination on this  issue amounts to clear error.   Isabel\n                                                             \n\nv. United States, 980 F.2d 60, 64 (1st Cir. 1992).  He points\n                \n\nto  no advice  by  counsel that  was  outside \"the  range  of\n\ncompetence demanded of attorneys  in criminal cases,\" nor any\n\nreason to  believe that counsel's choices  were not plausible\n\noptions.   United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 655 (1984);\n                                  \n\nsee also Barrett v. United States, 965 F.2d 1184, 1193 &amp; n.18\n                                 \n\n(1st Cir.  1992) (\"We may  not find a  deficient professional\n\nperformance in the constitutional sense unless the challenged\n\n                    \n\nBIA's  mixed  legal/factual conclusion  that  he  is in  this\ncountry  \"involuntarily.\"   As  the  cases cited  in  the BIA\ndecision show, the BIA's conclusion reflects only appellant's\nstatus as a prisoner.  It does  not reflect in any way on the\nlegality of appellant's conviction under 21 U.S.C.   955.   \n\n                             -5-\n\ndecisions   were   not   `plausible   options'.\")   (citation\n\nomitted).2   \n\n          For  these  reasons,  the  district  court's  order\n\ndismissing the petition is affirmed.\n                                   \n\n                    \n\n2.  In  a letter  to  this court  dated the  same day  as his\nbrief, December 18, 1992, appellant  alleges that he did  not\nhave  access  to a  law  library from  January,  1992 through\nNovember 6, 1992.  As he  did not object on this basis below,\nand had access  to a  library for purposes  of his  appellate\nbrief here,  we construe  his letter request  for \"reasonable\nrelief\"  as,  in  effect,  asking  that  we  read  his  brief\nliberally.  This  we have done, resolving all  ambiguities in\nhis favor. \n\n                             -6-\n",

In support of his argument, appellant has appended to his\nbrief  a July 21, 1992  decision of the  Board of Immigration\nAppeals  [\"BIA\"]  in his  deportation  case.   That  separate\nproceeding  involves different  legal  issues which  are  not\nbefore  us.   Moreover, appellant  misplaces reliance  on the\n\n                             -4-\n\n          Appellant's final contention that he was denied the\n\neffective  assistance of counsel is belied by his own written\n\nstatements   at  the   time,  expressing   satisfaction  with\n\ncounsel's performance,  and the  district  court's report  of\n\nsimilar  statements at  the \"change  of plea\"  hearing.
