At  issue in this\n                                         \n\nappeal is whether appellant  Cotto-Garc a was tardy in filing\n\nhis \"claim\" contesting the government's in rem seizure, under\n                                              \n\ndrug laws, of his stock shares.  Under relevant rules, infra,\n                                                            \n\nappellant had  \"10 days after  process has been  executed\" to\n\nfile the required claim.   He contends he filed the  claim on\n\ntime (in  fact, prematurely), as process  was executed, under\n\nhis theory,  only when notice of  the government's forfeiture\n\naction was published     an  event that did  not occur  until\n                    \n\nafter Cotto-Garc a had filed  his claim.  The  district court\n     \n\nrejected  this argument.   It ruled that  \"process [had] been\n\nexecuted\" much earlier, at  the time appellant was personally\n\nserved  with   notice  of  the  forfeiture   action,  causing\n\nappellant's later filing to  fall outside the ten-day period.\n\n          Like the district  court, we reject  Cotto-Garc a's\n\ntheory   that  the   date  when   notice  was   published  is\n                                                         \n\ndeterminative as to him.   We agree  with the court that  the\n\nearlier  notification  to   appellant  by  personal   service\n\nconstituted  the  relevant  notice.   But  while  service  of\n\npersonal  notice upon the owner of the res (or other adequate\n                                          \n\nnotification)  was a  necessary element  of the  execution of\n\nprocess in this proceeding  in rem, it was not  sufficient by\n                                                          \n\nitself  to fulfill  the triggering  requirement in  the rules\n\nthat \"process has  been executed.\"   \"Process\" in  an in  rem\n                                                             \n\n                             -3-\n\naction consists  fundamentally of  the warrant for  arrest of\n\nthe property  to be  seized.  \"Execution\"  of such  \"process\"\n\nconsists of service of the  arrest warrant upon the defendant\n\nproperty, after which the marshal files with the court  proof\n\nof service.   In the present  case, we find in  the record an\n\nissued  arrest warrant, but we find no process return form or\n\nother  proof showing that the  arrest warrant was served upon\n\nappellant's shares of stock and when this  occurred.  Without\n\na return or at  least some showing that service  occurred, it\n\nis  impossible to say whether and when the arrest warrant was\n\nexecuted.  Had the arrest warrant been properly served on the\n\nstock  on or before January  3, 1992, the  day when appellant\n\npersonally was served, we would agree with the district court\n\nthat  the ten-day  period  commenced to  run  on the  day  of\n\npersonal  service,  to wit,  January 3.    But if  the arrest\n\nwarrant  had not by then  been served, and  was served either\n\nlater or not at all, the mere giving of personal notice alone\n\nwould not have constituted the \"execution\" of \"process.\"  And\n\nuntil process had been  executed, the ten-day period  did not\n\nbegin to run.\n\n          We accordingly  vacate and remand,  with directions\n\nto  the  district court  to  determine whether  and  when the\n\nwarrant  for   arrest  of   the  property  was   served  upon\n\nappellant's stock  shares, and, applying  that information in\n\nlight of the  present opinion, to determine if \"process [had]\n\n                             -4-\n\nbeen executed\" as of  January 3, 1992 when notice  was served\n\nupon  appellant.   Until this  is correctly  ascertained, the\n\ntimeliness  of   appellant's  filing  of   claim  cannot   be\n\ndetermined.\n\n          We  turn  now  to  a detailed  discussion  of  this\n\nappeal.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Appellant  Domingo  Cotto-Garc a  was arrested  and\n\nindicted  in June 1991 for federal drug offenses.  He pleaded\n\nguilty  to  these in  October 1991.    After his  arrest, the\n\nUnited   States   government   initiated   civil   forfeiture\n\nproceedings  against all  known  properties of  Cotto-Garc a.\n\nOne  of the  forfeiture actions began  on December  18, 1991,\n\nwhen the United States  government filed a complaint pursuant\n\nto 21  U.S.C.   881(a)(6) and  18 U.S.C.   981  in the United\n\nStates District Court for  the District of Puerto Rico.   The\n\ngovernment sought forfeiture of approximately 2,538.85 shares\n\nof stock  of the Ponce  Leones Baseball Club,  Inc. allegedly\n\nowned  by Cotto-Garc a  and purchased  with proceeds  of drug\n\ntransactions.  A motion for issuance of warrants was filed by\n\nthe government on the same day.  \n\n          On December 31, 1991, the clerk of the court issued\n\nand delivered two warrants to  the U.S. Attorney, pursuant to\n\na magistrate's order of December 30.  One of the warrants was\n\na warrant for arrest in rem.  It ordered the  U.S. Marshal to\n                           \n\n                             -5-\n\nseize the defendant  (the 2,538.85  shares of  stock) and  to\n\nnotify \"the owner and/or possessor\" to file a claim \"ten (10)\n\ndays  after service,  .  . .  [and]  thereafter a  responsive\n\npleading  to  the Complaint  filed  within  twenty (20)  days\n\nfollowing such claim  or thirty (30) days  after the service,\n\nwhichever is less .  . . .\"   The second warrant was  one for\n\n\"seizure  and monition,\"  ordering the  marshal to  publish a\n\nnewspaper announcement to  notify \"all  persons claiming  the\n\nsame\" to file a claim \"no  later than ten (10) days after the\n\nlast publication.\"\n\n          On  January  3,  1992,  the alleged  owner  of  the\n\nstocks,  appellant Cotto-Garc a      imprisoned  at  a  state\n\npenitentiary at  Rio Piedras,  Puerto Rico     was personally\n\nserved by a marshal with copies  of the complaint and of both\n\nwarrants.  On January 30, 1992, the government  requested the\n\ncourt to enter default judgment against Cotto-Garc a (and the\n\nvarious other persons who had been personally served) because\n\nno claim for  the property  had been filed.   The  magistrate\n\nlater denied this request for default.\n\n          The next day, January  31, 1992, Cotto-Garc a filed\n\na verified notice of  claim, attesting that he was  the owner\n\nof the property named in the complaint.  The government moved\n\nto strike  the notice of  claim on February  4, 1992,  on the\n\ngrounds that it was filed late under Supplemental  Rule C(6).\n\nA magistrate  granted the  motion to  strike on February  12,\n\n                             -6-\n\n1992.1   In the meantime,  a copy of  the warrant  of seizure\n\nand monition was published on  February 7 in El Nuevo  D a, a\n                                                          \n\nnewspaper  in  Puerto  Rico;  no  one  filed  a  claim  after\n\npublication of the notice.  \n\n          Cotto-Garc a appealed from  the magistrate's  order\n\nstriking his claim to the district court.  The district court\n\nissued an  opinion agreeing  with the magistrate  that Cotto-\n\nGarc a's claim had been filed out of time.  Pursuant thereto,\n\nthe court dismissed Cotto-Garc a's appeal from the magistrate\n\nand,  finding  no  other  claimants,  ordered  the   property\n\nforfeited  to the  United  States of  America.   Cotto-Garc a\n\nappeals from the final judgment.\n\n                             II.\n\n          We now review the  procedures that must be followed\n\nin  civil  forfeiture actions  like  this.   This  forfeiture\n\naction  was  brought by  the  United States  pursuant  to the\n\nComprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention  and Control Act of 1970,\n\n21  U.S.C.    881(a)(6),  and the  Money  Laundering Act,  18\n\nU.S.C.    981.   21  U.S.C.    881(a)(6) provides  that, \"all\n\nmoneys,  negotiable instruments, securities,  or other things\n\nof  value furnished or intended to be furnished by any person\n\nin exchange  for a controlled substance in  violation of this\n\n                    \n\n1.  Nevertheless, one  week after  the magistrate struck  his\nclaim, Cotto-Garc a requested an  extension of time to answer\nthe complaint.   The  government responded  that Cotto-Garc a\nhad  no standing  in  the  case  since  his  claim  had  been\nstricken.  The court took no action on this motion.\n\n                             -7-\n\nsubchapter [and] all proceeds  traceable to such an exchange\"\n\nare subject to  forfeiture to the United States.   Similarly,\n\n18 U.S.C.   981 subjects property related to money laundering\n\nto forfeiture.\n\n          Both  forfeiture  statutes  provide,  with  certain\n\nexceptions, that  the property  shall be seized  upon process\n\nissued  pursuant  to  the   Supplemental  Rules  for  Certain\n\nAdmiralty  and Maritime Claims  by any district  court of the\n\nUnited  States having  jurisdiction over  the property.2   21\n\nU.S.C.     881(b);   18  U.S.C.      981(b)(2).    Thus   the\n\nSupplemental Rules govern the procedures for civil forfeiture\n\nactions.   See  Fed. R.  Civ. P.,  Supp. R.  A  et seq.   The\n                                                       \n\nFederal Rules for  Civil Procedure also  apply except to  the\n\nextent  that  they  are inconsistent  with  the  Supplemental\n\nRules.  See Supp. R. A.\n           \n\n          Supplemental Rule C contains special provisions for\n\nactions in rem, including  civil forfeiture proceedings.  The\n              \n\naction in rem is  brought by the plaintiff (here,  the United\n             \n\nStates)  against the  defendant property  which  is allegedly\n\n                    \n\n2.  \"Alternatively,  the government  may commence  a criminal\nforfeiture  proceeding  by  requesting  'the  issuance  of  a\nwarrant  authorizing  the  seizure  of  property  subject  to\nforfeiture under [section 881] in the same manner as provided\nfor a  search warrant  under the  Federal  Rules of  Criminal\nProcedure.'  21 U.S.C.    881(b) (Supp. 1990).   Federal Rule\nof  Criminal  Procedure 41  governs  the  issuance of  search\nwarrants.   See Fed. R. Crim.  P. 41.\"  United  States v.

The\n\ngovernment must file a verified complaint, in accordance with\n\nthe requirements of Supplemental Rules C(2) and E(2)(a), with\n\nthe clerk of the court and request issuance of a  warrant for\n\nthe arrest of the property.  \n\n          If  upon  reviewing  the complaint  and  supporting\n\npapers the court finds  that conditions for an action  in rem\n                                                             \n\nappear  to exist,  the  court orders  the  clerk to  issue  a\n\nwarrant  for arrest of  the property.   Supp.  R. C(3).   The\n                                    \n\nclerk delivers the warrant to the marshal or other authorized\n\nperson, who  serves the  warrant for arrest  of the  property\n\neither by taking possession of the property or by other means\n\npursuant to Supplemental Rule E(4).  See Supp. R. C(3); Supp.\n                                        \n\nR. E(4).   Rule E(4),  which governs execution of the warrant\n\nfor arrest of the property, provides, in part:\n\n          (a)   In  General.    Upon  issuance  and\n                            \n          delivery of the process . . . the marshal\n          or other person or organization  having a\n          warrant   shall  forthwith   execute  the\n                                                   \n          process    in   accordance    with   this\n                 \n          subdivision  (4),  making due  and prompt\n          return.  [Emphasis supplied.]\n\nService,  or execution,  of process  on tangible  property is\n\ngenerally done by  taking it into possession;  service of the\n\nwarrant on intangible  property is generally accomplished  by\n\nleaving  a  copy  of  the  complaint  and  process  with  the\n\ngarnishee or other obligor.

In addition to service on the\n\nproperty,  notice of the action  in rem is  given by personal\n                                       \n\nservice  of copies of the  complaint and warrant upon persons\n\nknown to have an interest in the property that is the subject\n\nof the action, and, in most cases, by  publication in a local\n\nnewspaper.  See Supp. R. C(4).4\n               \n\n          Before  a claimant in a forfeiture case can file an\n\nanswer and defend  on the  merits, the claimant  must file  a\n\nclaim pursuant to Rule C(6).

He looks\n\nto the warrant of  seizure and monition for support,  as that\n\nwarrant  (as  distinguished  from the  separate  warrant  for\n\narrest  in  rem)  states   that  \"all  persons  claiming  the\n               \n\n[property] . . . be and appear before the said  Court, at the\n\nCity of San Juan no  later than ten (10) days after  the last\n\npublication.\"  The government  agrees with the district court\n\nthat   Cotto-Garc a's  argument  would  be  correct  for  any\n\n                             -11-\n\nclaimant  that had  not earlier  been personally  served with\n\ncopies of  the  warrants, but  contends  that Mr.  Cotto  was\n\npersonally   served  with   process   on  January   3,  1992.\n\nTherefore,  the  government urges,  his  ten days  to  file a\n\nnotice of claim established by Rule  C(6) had run out by  the\n\ntime he filed  his claim on January 31, 1992.

However,  a  deadline tied  to  the  notice\n\npublication date would, for  someone who had already received\n\nnotice  by personal  service,  make little  sense.

All  that would\n\noccur, were  we to  adopt appellant's  position, would  be to\n\npermit  claimants  who  have  been  personally  notified   to\n\nunjustifiably  delay filing  their  claims.

We, therefore, agree  with the\n\ndistrict court that, in the  case of an owner of  property to\n\nwhom notice  is first given  by personal service,  the notice\n\ncomponent  of \"process\"  is fully  satisfied by  the personal\n\nservice.   There  is  no justification  whatever for  waiting\n\nthereafter until notice by newspaper publication is made    a\n\nform of notification clearly  addressed only to those persons\n\nwho have not earlier been identified and personally served.\n\n          But  a  harder  question  lurks  here.    Appellant\n\nasserts,  and  the record  seems to  bear  him out,  that the\n\nwarrant  for arrest and seizure  of the res,  i.e., the stock\n                                           \n\nshares, was never served.  Insofar as service of such process\n\nis also  an essential part  of the  \"execution\" of  \"process\"\n\nthat triggers the  running of the  ten-day period under  Rule\n\n                             -14-\n\nC(6), it may be that January 3, 1992, the date when appellant\n\nwas personally served, did not trigger the running of the ten\n                              \n\ndays.   Indeed, while personal service of notice on the owner\n\n(or alternative  means of  giving notice) seems  an essential\n\ningredient of execution  of process in an  in rem proceeding,\n                                                 \n\nit is not the process specifically mentioned in the Admiralty\n         \n\nRules.  The  text of  the Rules quite  clearly indicate  that\n\nRule C(6)'s reference to execution of process  applies to the\n\nservice of the warrant for arrest in rem on the res, here the\n                                                   \n\nstock shares. The description of the  triggering date in Rule\n\nC(6)      when \"process  has been  executed\"     is  the same\n\nphraseology found in  Rule E(4) describing service  of the in\n                                                             \n\nrem warrant.   It seems clear, therefore,  that the reference\n   \n\nto process  execution in Rule  C(6) comprehends service  of a\n\nduly issued warrant of arrest on the defendant property.\n\n          We hold,  therefore,  that the  words \"process  has\n\nbeen  executed\" are satisfied under Rule C(6) only when (1) a\n\nproperly issued warrant for  arrest in rem has been  properly\n                                          \n\nexecuted, i.e., served upon  the res; and, (2)  the requisite\n                                    \n\nnotice  has been given to potential claimants.5  If the first\n\nelement has already been met,  then the ten-day filing period\n\nbegins to  run as to a  claimant who is personally  served on\n\n                    \n\n5.  As we have  discussed and will discuss  at greater length\nbelow, while the personal notice requirement is not expressly\nset  out in  the Admiralty Rules,  we think  it also  must be\nregarded as an element of the \"process\" required by Rule C(6)\nto be \"executed.\"\n\n                             -15-\n\nthe date of  personal service.   For  others, assuming  again\n\nthat  the first  element has  been previously  fulfilled, the\n\nten-day period  begins on the  date of the  final publication\n\nnotice (if any is required by Rule C(4)).\n\n          The first element    that the warrant for arrest of\n\nthe  property  be  issued  and  executed  before  process  is\n\nconsidered to  have  been  executed     arises,  as  we  have\n\nalready said,  from Supplemental  Rules C(3) and  E(4), which\n\ndefine the  procedures for execution  of process.   See supra\n                                                             \n\nPart II.  Clearly  \"process\" as used there means  the warrant\n\nfor  arrest in rem, and  that process is  executed by service\n                  \n\nupon  the property  subject to  forfeiture.   Supp. R.

These  procedures  do not  expressly include  personal\n\nservice of  a copy of the warrant upon the owner, and plainly\n\nare not met merely by such personal service.\n\n                             -16-\n\n          This  is not  to say  that notice  to the  owner is\n\nirrelevant  to  the Rule  C(6)  formulation.

While  admiralty law\n\ntraditionally  presumed that  service of  the warrant  on the\n\nproperty (e.g., by seizing the vessel or posting  notice) was\n\nsufficient to  give constructive  notice of the  action, that\n\npresumption  is  dubious   in  the  circumstances  of   civil\n\nforfeiture  proceedings such  as  the instant  case.

Some courts,  it is\n         \n\ntrue, have suggested  that service of the  warrant for arrest\n\non  the  res itself  suffices,  in all  forfeiture  cases, to\n            \n\nconstitute  execution of  process  for purposes  of the  time\n\nlimits  in Rule  C(6),  regardless of  when  the claimant  is\n                                  \n\nnotified.  See  $38,570 U.S. Currency,  950 F.2d at  1113-14;\n                                     \n\nsee also United States Currency Totalling $3,817.49, 826 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat 786-87 (rejecting argument  that process is served through\n\npublication of the notice).  That interpretation of the rule,\n\nhowever,  raise both constitutional6  and practical problems7\n\n                    \n\n6.  Constitutional  questions  arise   because  this   strict\ninterpretation implicitly assumes that service of the warrant\non the  property    either by seizing it or posting notice of\nthe action,  pursuant to  Supplemental Rule E(4)     provides\nadequate  notice  to  potential claimants  that  a forfeiture\naction  is pending.   This  presumption applied  in admiralty\nlaw,  where it was presumed \"that the vessel owner, through a\nmaster, agent, or personal presence, will maintain reasonable\ncontact  with  and  continuing  interest in  the  status  and\n\n                             -17-\n\nwhen it is applied.  For  example, under this interpretation,\n\na person  might not receive notice  (through personal service\n\nor publication) until  seven days after the  warrant has been\n\n                    \n\ncondition  of  the vessel.\"    MacDougalls'  Cape Cod  Marine\n                                                             \nServ.,  Inc. v.

While constitutional  in some cases,  this\npresumption is  rebuttable; for example, this  court has held\nin  an admiralty action that  posting notice on  a vessel was\ninsufficient   to   satisfy   constitutional    due   process\nrequirements where the owner was known to be out of the area.\nId.  \n   \n     The Supreme Court  has expressly held  that, even in  an\naction in rem, \"[n]otice by mail or other means as certain to\n             \nensure actual notice is a minimum constitutional precondition\nto a proceeding  which will adversely  affect the liberty  or\nproperty interests  of any party, whether  unlettered or well\n                          \nversed  in commercial practice,  if its name  and address are\nreasonably  ascertainable.\"   Mennonite Board of  Missions v.\n                                                          \nAdams, 462 U.S. 791, 800 (1983) (emphasis in original).\n     \n\n7.  Practical problems arise because  notice of the action in\n                                                             \nrem,  whether  by personal  service  or  publication, is  not\n   \nrequired  to  be  given  at  any  particular  time,  and,  in\npractice,  is usually  given at  least a  few days  after the\nseizure of the property.  Notice might not be given until ten\ndays  or more after the property is seized.  Therefore, under\nthe Fifth Circuit's interpretation of Rule C(6), the deadline\nfor  filing claims could have passed by the time one receives\nnotice of the  action.   $38,570 U.S. Currency,  950 F.2d  at\n                                              \n1114;  United States v.

In\n                                \naddition, the  government is  not required to  tell claimants\nthe date of the seizure, but only to put claimants \"on notice\n        \nthat execution of process on the res had recently occurred or\n                                    \nwas  imminent.\"   $38,570 U.S.  Currency, 950  F.2d at  1114.\n                                        \nThus, even when  one receives  notice before the  end of  the\nten-day period,  claimants are left  to their own  devices to\ninvestigate the  records at  the courthouse to  discover when\ntheir ten-day filing period began.

We believe that the drafters of Rule C(6) intended to\n\ngive claimants ten days, not three, to file their claims, and\n\nthat the  rule should be interpreted  to avoid constitutional\n\nquestions.

For these\n\nreasons, we hold  that the  giving of adequate  notice is  an\n\nessential element  of the \"process\" to be executed before the\n\nten-day  filing  period  of  Rule  C(6) begins.    But  while\n\npersonal  service of a copy  of the arrest  warrant (or other\n\nsuitable notice) is,  therefore, part and parcel  of the Rule\n\nC(6)  execution-of-process trigger,  it  is  not  coextensive\n\ntherewith.   Equally  fundamental  is service  of the  arrest\n\n                             -19-\n\nwarrant  upon the res, and this also must be fulfilled before\n                     \n\nprocess can be deemed to have been executed.8\n\n          The district court order in this case does not make\n\nclear exactly how the  court interpreted the phrase, \"process\n\nhas been  executed.\"  While it  rejected appellant's argument\n\nthat  the  publication date  was  relevant  to claimants  who\n\nreceived  personal service,  it did  not consider  whether or\n\nwhen the first element    execution of the warrant for arrest\n\nin rem    had been fulfilled.   This, by itself, would not be\n      \n\nfatal if, as might normally be  expected, it could reasonably\n\nbe  assumed that the arrest warrant had, in fact, been served\n\non the  res before  or in  conjunction with  personal service\n           \n\nupon appellant.   But such, unfortunately, was  not the case,\n\nas we next discuss.\n\n                             IV.\n\n          The  district court found that because Cotto-Garc a\n\nwas personally served  on January  3, 1992, his  ten days  to\n\nfile a claim began then.  The difficulty with this finding is\n\nthat there is absolutely no indication  in the district court\n\nrecord that as of January 3, 1992, the  warrant for arrest of\n\n                    \n\n8.  The  situation can  perhaps  be analogized  to serving  a\ndefendant in a  personal action  with a copy  of a  complaint\nthat  was  never   filed  in  court.     While  the   service\nrequirements of  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  4 may  have been met,  the\nfailure to have instituted a  viable lawsuit would render the\nnotice meaningless.  Here,  the failure to serve  the warrant\non the  res leaves the  court without  jurisdiction over  the\n           \n\"defendant\" (i.e.,  the object in dispute),  hence the giving\nof notice is a meaningless exercise.\n\n                             -20-\n\nthe  property had ever been executed upon the stock shares in\n\nissue.   There is in the record no process receipt and return\n\nform  or  other proof  of  service  executed by  the  marshal\n\nindicating service of the warrant upon the res.  That  is not\n                                              \n\nto say  that the  marshal's return  would necessarily  be the\n\nsole  means to  prove  execution of  process; other  evidence\n\nmight suffice.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(g); 4A Federal Practice\n                                                             \n\nand Procedure    1130  at 344-48.   But  the date of  process\n             \n\nexecution must be known  in order to determine when  the ten-\n\nday  period  commenced   to  run.     And  this  problem   is\n\nintensified, and not  resolved, by the  government's puzzling\n\npost-argument filing described in the note below.9 \n\n                    \n\n9.  Two  months after  oral argument  before this  court, the\ngovernment filed  a motion setting  forth its version  of the\ndate and  circumstances of the  alleged seizure of  the stock\ncertificates.  The government  asserted that the property was\nseized on December 17, 1991.  This date is one day before the\n                                                         \nforfeiture  complaint  was  filed.    While  no  warrant  was\nattached  to the  motion, the  motion was  accompanied  by an\nunauthenticated copy  of a  process receipt and  return form,\npurportedly  signed by  a U.S.  Marshal, indicating  that one\nWender Colon, Secretary of  Ponce Leones Baseball Club, Inc.,\nwas personally  served with  a \"seizure warrant\"  on December\n18,  1991 at  9:30 a.m., and  a copy  of a  stock certificate\ncertifying that  the United  States of America  owns 2,535.07\nshares  (not 2,538.85  shares) of  the Ponce  Leones Baseball\nClub as of December 18, 1991.\n     These documents were apparently never filed or submitted\nto  the district court; they  are not listed  on the district\ncourt's docket sheet.  The only warrant in the record is  the\nlater,  apparently unserved, warrant dated December 31, 1991,\nraising  the question  why, if  the seizure had  already been\nvalidly  executed, a  further warrant  was secured.   In  any\ncase, papers not  filed with the  district court or  admitted\ninto evidence by  that court are  not part of  the record  on\nappeal.   See Fed. R. App. P. 10(a); Kirshner v. Uniden Corp.\n                                                             \nof America, 842 F.2d  1074, 1077 (9th Cir. 1988).

Only in  extraordinary circumstances will we remand\n\nfor further findings on an issue not timely raised below. See\n                                                             \n\nGermany v.

On this\n\nrecord, it  is impossible  reliably to determine  whether the\n\ndistrict   court  correctly   applied   Rule  C(6),   whether\n\nappellant's claim was  in fact  filed late,  and whether  the\n\ngovernment  itself complied with  the procedural requirements\n\nof the  Supplemental Rules.

If the  court finds that  a proper\n\narrest warrant was, in  fact, executed on the property  on or\n\n                             -23-\n\nbefore January 3, 1992,  then the court should find  that the\n\nRule  C(6) ten-day period began  on January 3,  the date that\n\nCotto-Garc a was  personally served.  If,  however, the court\n\nfinds that the warrant was not executed until later,  whether\n\nthe claim was  late depends  on the date  of that  execution,\n\nwhich becomes the triggering  date under Rule C(6).   If, for\n\nsome reason, the  warrant was never  served on the  property,\n                                   \n\nthen Cotto-Garc a's  claim was  not late because  process had\n\nyet to be executed by the time he filed his claim.  \n\n                              V.\n\n          In  conclusion, because the  record is insufficient\n\nto  determine the  timeliness  of  Cotto-Garc a's  claim,  we\n\nvacate  both the  affirmance  of the  magistrate's ruling  to\n\nstrike the notice of claim by Cotto-Garc a and the forfeiture\n\norder, and we remand to the district court with directions to\n\nreopen the record  and redetermine, in light of this opinion,\n\nwhether Cotto-Garc a's  notice of claim was  in fact untimely\n\nunder Rule C(6).   Because we vacate on  other grounds, we do\n\nnot  reach Cotto-Garc a's  argument that  the  district court\n\nshould have exercised  its discretion to extend the  time for\n\nfiling his claim.   Granting a discretionary  extension is an\n\noption that we  leave open  to the district  court on  remand\n\nshould  it conclude  that, although  the claim  was untimely,\n\nthere were sufficient factors justifying an extension.\n\n                             -24-\n\n          Vacated  and  remanded  for   further  proceedings.\n                                                             \n\nCosts for appellant.\n                   \n\n                             -25-\n",

At  issue in this\n                                         \n\nappeal is whether appellant  Cotto-Garc a was tardy in filing\n\nhis \"claim\" contesting the government's in rem seizure, under\n                                              \n\ndrug laws, of his stock shares.  Under relevant rules, infra,\n                                                            \n\nappellant had  \"10 days after  process has been  executed\" to\n\nfile the required claim.   He contends he filed the  claim on\n\ntime (in  fact, prematurely), as process  was executed, under\n\nhis theory,  only when notice of  the government's forfeiture\n\naction was published     an  event that did  not occur  until\n                    \n\nafter Cotto-Garc a had filed  his claim.  The  district court\n     \n\nrejected  this argument.   It ruled that  \"process [had] been\n\nexecuted\" much earlier, at  the time appellant was personally\n\nserved  with   notice  of  the  forfeiture   action,  causing\n\nappellant's later filing to  fall outside the ten-day period.\n\n          Like the district  court, we reject  Cotto-Garc a's\n\ntheory   that  the   date  when   notice  was   published  is\n                                                         \n\ndeterminative as to him.   We agree  with the court that  the\n\nearlier  notification  to   appellant  by  personal   service\n\nconstituted  the  relevant  notice.   But  while  service  of\n\npersonal  notice upon the owner of the res (or other adequate\n                                          \n\nnotification)  was a  necessary element  of the  execution of\n\nprocess in this proceeding  in rem, it was not  sufficient by\n                                                          \n\nitself  to fulfill  the triggering  requirement in  the rules\n\nthat \"process has  been executed.\"   \"Process\" in  an in  rem\n                                                             \n\n                             -3-\n\naction consists  fundamentally of  the warrant for  arrest of\n\nthe property  to be  seized.  \"Execution\"  of such  \"process\"\n\nconsists of service of the  arrest warrant upon the defendant\n\nproperty, after which the marshal files with the court  proof\n\nof service.   In the present  case, we find in  the record an\n\nissued  arrest warrant, but we find no process return form or\n\nother  proof showing that the  arrest warrant was served upon\n\nappellant's shares of stock and when this  occurred.  Without\n\na return or at  least some showing that service  occurred, it\n\nis  impossible to say whether and when the arrest warrant was\n\nexecuted.  Had the arrest warrant been properly served on the\n\nstock  on or before January  3, 1992, the  day when appellant\n\npersonally was served, we would agree with the district court\n\nthat  the ten-day  period  commenced to  run  on the  day  of\n\npersonal  service,  to wit,  January 3.    But if  the arrest\n\nwarrant  had not by then  been served, and  was served either\n\nlater or not at all, the mere giving of personal notice alone\n\nwould not have constituted the \"execution\" of \"process.\"  And\n\nuntil process had been  executed, the ten-day period  did not\n\nbegin to run.\n\n          We accordingly  vacate and remand,  with directions\n\nto  the  district court  to  determine whether  and  when the\n\nwarrant  for   arrest  of   the  property  was   served  upon\n\nappellant's stock  shares, and, applying  that information in\n\nlight of the  present opinion, to determine if \"process [had]\n\n                             -4-\n\nbeen executed\" as of  January 3, 1992 when notice  was served\n\nupon  appellant.   Until this  is correctly  ascertained, the\n\ntimeliness  of   appellant's  filing  of   claim  cannot   be\n\ndetermined.\n\n          We  turn  now  to  a detailed  discussion  of  this\n\nappeal.\n\n                              I.\n\n          Appellant  Domingo  Cotto-Garc a  was arrested  and\n\nindicted  in June 1991 for federal drug offenses.  He pleaded\n\nguilty  to  these in  October 1991.    After his  arrest, the\n\nUnited   States   government   initiated   civil   forfeiture\n\nproceedings  against all  known  properties of  Cotto-Garc a.\n\nOne  of the  forfeiture actions began  on December  18, 1991,\n\nwhen the United States  government filed a complaint pursuant\n\nto 21  U.S.C.   881(a)(6) and  18 U.S.C.   981  in the United\n\nStates District Court for  the District of Puerto Rico.   The\n\ngovernment sought forfeiture of approximately 2,538.85 shares\n\nof stock  of the Ponce  Leones Baseball Club,  Inc. allegedly\n\nowned  by Cotto-Garc a  and purchased  with proceeds  of drug\n\ntransactions.  A motion for issuance of warrants was filed by\n\nthe government on the same day.  \n\n          On December 31, 1991, the clerk of the court issued\n\nand delivered two warrants to  the U.S. Attorney, pursuant to\n\na magistrate's order of December 30.  One of the warrants was\n\na warrant for arrest in rem.  It ordered the  U.S. Marshal to\n                           \n\n                             -5-\n\nseize the defendant  (the 2,538.85  shares of  stock) and  to\n\nnotify \"the owner and/or possessor\" to file a claim \"ten (10)\n\ndays  after service,  .  . .  [and]  thereafter a  responsive\n\npleading  to  the Complaint  filed  within  twenty (20)  days\n\nfollowing such claim  or thirty (30) days  after the service,\n\nwhichever is less .  . . .\"   The second warrant was  one for\n\n\"seizure  and monition,\"  ordering the  marshal to  publish a\n\nnewspaper announcement to  notify \"all  persons claiming  the\n\nsame\" to file a claim \"no  later than ten (10) days after the\n\nlast publication.\"\n\n          On  January  3,  1992,  the alleged  owner  of  the\n\nstocks,  appellant Cotto-Garc a      imprisoned  at  a  state\n\npenitentiary at  Rio Piedras,  Puerto Rico     was personally\n\nserved by a marshal with copies  of the complaint and of both\n\nwarrants.  On January 30, 1992, the government  requested the\n\ncourt to enter default judgment against Cotto-Garc a (and the\n\nvarious other persons who had been personally served) because\n\nno claim for  the property  had been filed.   The  magistrate\n\nlater denied this request for default.\n\n          The next day, January  31, 1992, Cotto-Garc a filed\n\na verified notice of  claim, attesting that he was  the owner\n\nof the property named in the complaint.  The government moved\n\nto strike  the notice of  claim on February  4, 1992,  on the\n\ngrounds that it was filed late under Supplemental  Rule C(6).\n\nA magistrate  granted the  motion to  strike on February  12,\n\n                             -6-\n\n1992.1   In the meantime,  a copy of  the warrant  of seizure\n\nand monition was published on  February 7 in El Nuevo  D a, a\n                                                          \n\nnewspaper  in  Puerto  Rico;  no  one  filed  a  claim  after\n\npublication of the notice.  \n\n          Cotto-Garc a appealed from  the magistrate's  order\n\nstriking his claim to the district court.  The district court\n\nissued an  opinion agreeing  with the magistrate  that Cotto-\n\nGarc a's claim had been filed out of time.  Pursuant thereto,\n\nthe court dismissed Cotto-Garc a's appeal from the magistrate\n\nand,  finding  no  other  claimants,  ordered  the   property\n\nforfeited  to the  United  States of  America.   Cotto-Garc a\n\nappeals from the final judgment.\n\n                             II.\n\n          We now review the  procedures that must be followed\n\nin  civil  forfeiture actions  like  this.   This  forfeiture\n\naction  was  brought by  the  United States  pursuant  to the\n\nComprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention  and Control Act of 1970,\n\n21  U.S.C.    881(a)(6),  and the  Money  Laundering Act,  18\n\nU.S.C.    981.   21  U.S.C.    881(a)(6) provides  that, \"all\n\nmoneys,  negotiable instruments, securities,  or other things\n\nof  value furnished or intended to be furnished by any person\n\nin exchange  for a controlled substance in  violation of this\n\n                    \n\n1.  Nevertheless, one  week after  the magistrate struck  his\nclaim, Cotto-Garc a requested an  extension of time to answer\nthe complaint.   The  government responded  that Cotto-Garc a\nhad  no standing  in  the  case  since  his  claim  had  been\nstricken.  The court took no action on this motion.\n\n                             -7-\n\nsubchapter [and] all proceeds  traceable to such an exchange\"\n\nare subject to  forfeiture to the United States.   Similarly,\n\n18 U.S.C.   981 subjects property related to money laundering\n\nto forfeiture.\n\n          Both  forfeiture  statutes  provide,  with  certain\n\nexceptions, that  the property  shall be seized  upon process\n\nissued  pursuant  to  the   Supplemental  Rules  for  Certain\n\nAdmiralty  and Maritime Claims  by any district  court of the\n\nUnited  States having  jurisdiction over  the property.2   21\n\nU.S.C.     881(b);   18  U.S.C.      981(b)(2).    Thus   the\n\nSupplemental Rules govern the procedures for civil forfeiture\n\nactions.   See  Fed. R.  Civ. P.,  Supp. R.  A  et seq.   The\n                                                       \n\nFederal Rules for  Civil Procedure also  apply except to  the\n\nextent  that  they  are inconsistent  with  the  Supplemental\n\nRules.  See Supp. R. A.\n           \n\n          Supplemental Rule C contains special provisions for\n\nactions in rem, including  civil forfeiture proceedings.  The\n              \n\naction in rem is  brought by the plaintiff (here,  the United\n             \n\nStates)  against the  defendant property  which  is allegedly\n\n                    \n\n2.  \"Alternatively,  the government  may commence  a criminal\nforfeiture  proceeding  by  requesting  'the  issuance  of  a\nwarrant  authorizing  the  seizure  of  property  subject  to\nforfeiture under [section 881] in the same manner as provided\nfor a  search warrant  under the  Federal  Rules of  Criminal\nProcedure.'  21 U.S.C.    881(b) (Supp. 1990).

C(6).   \n\n          The crucial  issue in this appeal is the meaning of\n\nthe  phrase in  Rule C(6),  \"10 days  after process  has been\n\nexecuted.\"  \n\n                             III.\n\n          We  dispose  quickly   of  Cotto-Garc a's   primary\n\nargument  on appeal,  namely, that  his notice  of claim  was\n\ntimely filed on  January 31  because, in his  view, the  term\n\n\"process  has been executed\" in  Rule C(6) refers  to the day\n\nthe final published notice appeared (February 7), not the day\n\nhe was personally served  with notice (January 3).

We, therefore, agree  with the\n\ndistrict court that, in the  case of an owner of  property to\n\nwhom notice  is first given  by personal service,  the notice\n\ncomponent  of \"process\"  is fully  satisfied by  the personal\n\nservice.   There  is  no justification  whatever for  waiting\n\nthereafter until notice by newspaper publication is made    a\n\nform of notification clearly  addressed only to those persons\n\nwho have not earlier been identified and personally served.\n\n          But  a  harder  question  lurks  here.    Appellant\n\nasserts,  and  the record  seems to  bear  him out,  that the\n\nwarrant  for arrest and seizure  of the res,  i.e., the stock\n                                           \n\nshares, was never served.  Insofar as service of such process\n\nis also  an essential part  of the  \"execution\" of  \"process\"\n\nthat triggers the  running of the  ten-day period under  Rule\n\n                             -14-\n\nC(6), it may be that January 3, 1992, the date when appellant\n\nwas personally served, did not trigger the running of the ten\n                              \n\ndays.   Indeed, while personal service of notice on the owner\n\n(or alternative  means of  giving notice) seems  an essential\n\ningredient of execution  of process in an  in rem proceeding,\n                                                 \n\nit is not the process specifically mentioned in the Admiralty\n         \n\nRules.  The  text of  the Rules quite  clearly indicate  that\n\nRule C(6)'s reference to execution of process  applies to the\n\nservice of the warrant for arrest in rem on the res, here the\n                                                   \n\nstock shares. The description of the  triggering date in Rule\n\nC(6)      when \"process  has been  executed\"     is  the same\n\nphraseology found in  Rule E(4) describing service  of the in\n                                                             \n\nrem warrant.   It seems clear, therefore,  that the reference\n   \n\nto process  execution in Rule  C(6) comprehends service  of a\n\nduly issued warrant of arrest on the defendant property.\n\n          We hold,  therefore,  that the  words \"process  has\n\nbeen  executed\" are satisfied under Rule C(6) only when (1) a\n\nproperly issued warrant for  arrest in rem has been  properly\n                                          \n\nexecuted, i.e., served upon  the res; and, (2)  the requisite\n                                    \n\nnotice  has been given to potential claimants.5  If the first\n\nelement has already been met,  then the ten-day filing period\n\nbegins to  run as to a  claimant who is personally  served on\n\n                    \n\n5.  As we have  discussed and will discuss  at greater length\nbelow, while the personal notice requirement is not expressly\nset  out in  the Admiralty Rules,  we think  it also  must be\nregarded as an element of the \"process\" required by Rule C(6)\nto be \"executed.\"\n\n                             -15-\n\nthe date of  personal service.   For  others, assuming  again\n\nthat  the first  element has  been previously  fulfilled, the\n\nten-day period  begins on the  date of the  final publication\n\nnotice (if any is required by Rule C(4)).\n\n          The first element    that the warrant for arrest of\n\nthe  property  be  issued  and  executed  before  process  is\n\nconsidered to  have  been  executed     arises,  as  we  have\n\nalready said,  from Supplemental  Rules C(3) and  E(4), which\n\ndefine the  procedures for execution  of process.   See supra\n                                                             \n\nPart II.  Clearly  \"process\" as used there means  the warrant\n\nfor  arrest in rem, and  that process is  executed by service\n                  \n\nupon  the property  subject to  forfeiture.   Supp. R.

These  procedures  do not  expressly include  personal\n\nservice of  a copy of the warrant upon the owner, and plainly\n\nare not met merely by such personal service.\n\n                             -16-\n\n          This  is not  to say  that notice  to the  owner is\n\nirrelevant  to  the Rule  C(6)  formulation.

While  admiralty law\n\ntraditionally  presumed that  service of  the warrant  on the\n\nproperty (e.g., by seizing the vessel or posting  notice) was\n\nsufficient to  give constructive  notice of the  action, that\n\npresumption  is  dubious   in  the  circumstances  of   civil\n\nforfeiture  proceedings such  as  the instant  case.

Some courts,  it is\n         \n\ntrue, have suggested  that service of the  warrant for arrest\n\non  the  res itself  suffices,  in all  forfeiture  cases, to\n            \n\nconstitute  execution of  process  for purposes  of the  time\n\nlimits  in Rule  C(6),  regardless of  when  the claimant  is\n                                  \n\nnotified.

Constitutional  questions  arise   because  this   strict\ninterpretation implicitly assumes that service of the warrant\non the  property    either by seizing it or posting notice of\nthe action,  pursuant to  Supplemental Rule E(4)     provides\nadequate  notice  to  potential claimants  that  a forfeiture\naction  is pending.   This  presumption applied  in admiralty\nlaw,  where it was presumed \"that the vessel owner, through a\nmaster, agent, or personal presence, will maintain reasonable\ncontact  with  and  continuing  interest in  the  status  and\n\n                             -17-\n\nwhen it is applied.

For these\n\nreasons, we hold  that the  giving of adequate  notice is  an\n\nessential element  of the \"process\" to be executed before the\n\nten-day  filing  period  of  Rule  C(6) begins.    But  while\n\npersonal  service of a copy  of the arrest  warrant (or other\n\nsuitable notice) is,  therefore, part and parcel  of the Rule\n\nC(6)  execution-of-process trigger,  it  is  not  coextensive\n\ntherewith.   Equally  fundamental  is service  of the  arrest\n\n                             -19-\n\nwarrant  upon the res, and this also must be fulfilled before\n                     \n\nprocess can be deemed to have been executed.8\n\n          The district court order in this case does not make\n\nclear exactly how the  court interpreted the phrase, \"process\n\nhas been  executed.\"  While it  rejected appellant's argument\n\nthat  the  publication date  was  relevant  to claimants  who\n\nreceived  personal service,  it did  not consider  whether or\n\nwhen the first element    execution of the warrant for arrest\n\nin rem    had been fulfilled.   This, by itself, would not be\n      \n\nfatal if, as might normally be  expected, it could reasonably\n\nbe  assumed that the arrest warrant had, in fact, been served\n\non the  res before  or in  conjunction with  personal service\n           \n\nupon appellant.   But such, unfortunately, was  not the case,\n\nas we next discuss.\n\n                             IV.\n\n          The  district court found that because Cotto-Garc a\n\nwas personally served  on January  3, 1992, his  ten days  to\n\nfile a claim began then.  The difficulty with this finding is\n\nthat there is absolutely no indication  in the district court\n\nrecord that as of January 3, 1992, the  warrant for arrest of\n\n                    \n\n8.  The  situation can  perhaps  be analogized  to serving  a\ndefendant in a  personal action  with a copy  of a  complaint\nthat  was  never   filed  in  court.     While  the   service\nrequirements of  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  4 may  have been met,  the\nfailure to have instituted a  viable lawsuit would render the\nnotice meaningless.  Here,  the failure to serve  the warrant\non the  res leaves the  court without  jurisdiction over  the\n           \n\"defendant\" (i.e.,  the object in dispute),  hence the giving\nof notice is a meaningless exercise.\n\n                             -20-\n\nthe  property had ever been executed upon the stock shares in\n\nissue.   There is in the record no process receipt and return\n\nform  or  other proof  of  service  executed by  the  marshal\n\nindicating service of the warrant upon the res.  That  is not\n                                              \n\nto say  that the  marshal's return  would necessarily  be the\n\nsole  means to  prove  execution of  process; other  evidence\n\nmight suffice.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(g); 4A Federal Practice\n                                                             \n\nand Procedure    1130  at 344-48.   But  the date of  process\n             \n\nexecution must be known  in order to determine when  the ten-\n\nday  period  commenced   to  run.     And  this  problem   is\n\nintensified, and not  resolved, by the  government's puzzling\n\npost-argument filing described in the note below.9 \n\n                    \n\n9.  Two  months after  oral argument  before this  court, the\ngovernment filed  a motion setting  forth its version  of the\ndate and  circumstances of the  alleged seizure of  the stock\ncertificates.  The government  asserted that the property was\nseized on December 17, 1991.  This date is one day before the\n                                                         \nforfeiture  complaint  was  filed.    While  no  warrant  was\nattached  to the  motion, the  motion was  accompanied  by an\nunauthenticated copy  of a  process receipt and  return form,\npurportedly  signed by  a U.S.  Marshal, indicating  that one\nWender Colon, Secretary of  Ponce Leones Baseball Club, Inc.,\nwas personally  served with  a \"seizure warrant\"  on December\n18,  1991 at  9:30 a.m., and  a copy  of a  stock certificate\ncertifying that  the United  States of America  owns 2,535.07\nshares  (not 2,538.85  shares) of  the Ponce  Leones Baseball\nClub as of December 18, 1991.\n     These documents were apparently never filed or submitted\nto  the district court; they  are not listed  on the district\ncourt's docket sheet.  The only warrant in the record is  the\nlater,  apparently unserved, warrant dated December 31, 1991,\nraising  the question  why, if  the seizure had  already been\nvalidly  executed, a  further warrant  was secured.   In  any\ncase, papers not  filed with the  district court or  admitted\ninto evidence by  that court are  not part of  the record  on\nappeal.   See Fed. R. App. P. 10(a); Kirshner v.

On this\n\nrecord, it  is impossible  reliably to determine  whether the\n\ndistrict   court  correctly   applied   Rule  C(6),   whether\n\nappellant's claim was  in fact  filed late,  and whether  the\n\ngovernment  itself complied with  the procedural requirements\n\nof the  Supplemental Rules.

If,  however, the court\n\nfinds that the warrant was not executed until later,  whether\n\nthe claim was  late depends  on the date  of that  execution,\n\nwhich becomes the triggering  date under Rule C(6).
