Gaylon Massey filed an action  in the\n                    \n\ndistrict court pursuant  to 42 U.S.C.   1983.  At the time of\n\nthe events  described in  the  complaint, he  was a  pretrial\n\ndetainee at the  Suffolk County Jail.   His complaint alleged\n\nthat  his  constitutional   rights  were  violated   by  jail\n\npersonnel by the  use of excessive force, by their deliberate\n\nindifference  to his  medical needs  and  by the  involuntary\n\nadministration of psychotropic drugs.  The district court, in\n\na  margin  order,  granted  defendants'  motion  for  summary\n\njudgment  on the ground that plaintiff had failed \"to support\n\nhis substantive allegations by factual evidentiary material.\"\n\nIt also denied plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint  and\n\nhis request for  an extension of time  to complete discovery.\n\nPlaintiff appeals.\n\n          A.  Deliberate Indifference to Medical Needs\n                                                      \n\n          To  prevail  on   such  a  claim,  plaintiff   must\n\nestablish  that defendants' actions  amounted to  the \"wanton\n\ninfliction of unnecessary pain.\"  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n97, 104 (1976).  \"Deliberate indifference to  serious medical\n\nneeds of  prisoners\" satisfies this  standard.

Because plaintiff  was  a pretrial  detainee, the  Eighth\nAmendment does not apply;  rather, the due process clause  of\nthe   Fourteenth  Amendment   is   the  rubric   under  which\nplaintiff's claims are  analyzed.  See  Bell v. Wolfish,  441\n                                                       \nU.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979); Elliot v. Chesire County, 940 F.2d\n                                                   \n7,  10   &amp;  n.1   (1st  Cir.   1991)  (applying   \"deliberate\nindifference\"  standard under  the due  process  clause to  a\nclaim  of inadequate medical treatment provided to a pretrial\ndetainee).\n\n                             -2-\n\nNegligence and inadvertence in providing medical treatment do\n\nnot state a  valid claim of deliberate indifference.   Id. at\n                                                          \n\n105-06.\n\n          \"Where  the dispute  concerns  not the  absence  of\n\nhelp, but  the choice  of a certain  course of  treatment, or\n\nevidences mere disagreement with considered medical judgment,\n\nwe will  not second guess the doctors.\"  Sires v. Berman, 834\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 9,  13 (1st Cir.  1987).  In this  situation, deliberate\n\nindifference  may  be established  only \"where  the attention\n\nreceived is `so clearly inadequate  as to amount to a refusal\n\nto provide  essential care.'\"   Torraco v. Maloney,  923 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n231, 234 (1st Cir. 1991)  (quoting Miranda v. Munoz, 770 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n255, 259 (1st Cir. 1985)).  There is nothing in the record to\n\nshow  any refusal to  treat plaintiff.  He  was seen the same\n\nday as the incident, provided  with medication and sent for a\n\nconsultation to the hospital.  Plainly, there  is no material\n\nquestion  of  fact  that  defendants  were not  \"deliberately\n\nindifferent\" to  plaintiff's medical needs.   Discovery would\n\nnot aid plaintiff.\n\n          B.  Involuntary Medication with Psychotropic Drugs\n                                                            \n\n          It  has been  clear  since  February  1990  that  a\n\nprisoner  \"possesses   a  significant  liberty   interest  in\n        \n\navoiding the  unwanted administration of  antipsychotic drugs\n\nunder  the Due Process  Clause of the  Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\n                             -3-\n\nSee  Washington  v.  Harper, 494  U.S.  210,  221-22 (1990).2\n                           \n\nHarper  involved a  challenge to  the  state of  Washington's\n      \n\nprocedures for  medicating  prisoners housed  in its  Special\n\nOffender Center  (SOC), an institution  for convicted  felons\n\nwith serious  mental illnesses.   The  specific question  the\n\nCourt  addressed was whether  a judicial hearing  is required\n\nbefore  a  state  may  treat  a  mentally-ill  prisoner  with\n\nantipsychotic drugs against his will.  Id. at 213.  The Court\n                                          \n\ndetermined that the SOC's policies, which did not provide for\n\nsuch a hearing, were constitutional.  Id. at 231.\n                                         \n\n          The facts of the case at hand, however, concern not\n\nthe treatment of a prisoner with antipsychotic drugs, but the\n             \n\nemergency  administration of this kind of medication based on\n         \n\na pretrial detainee's threatening behavior.  Qualified\n\nimmunity  protects state actors  from damages claims  under  \n\n1983  \"insofar  as  their conduct  does  not  violate clearly\n\nestablished statutory  or  constitutional rights  of which  a\n\nreasonable person would  have known.\"  Harlow  v. Fitzgerald,\n                                                            \n\n457 U.S.  800, 818 (1982).   That is, \"[t]he contours  of the\n\nright must be  sufficiently clear that a  reasonable official\n\n                    \n\n2.  In 1992,  in Riggins v.  Nevada, 112 S. Ct.  1810 (1992),\n                                   \nthe Court decided that  a detainee had the  right to be  free\nfrom treatment  with antipsychotic drugs during  trial unless\nthe state had  determined that \"treatment  with antipsychotic\n                                         \nmedication  was medically  appropriate and,  considering less\nintrusive  alternatives,  essential  for  the  sake  of  [the\ndetainee's] own safety or the safety of others.\"  Id. at 1815\n                                                     \n(emphasis added).\n\n                             -4-\n\nwould  understand that what he is doing violates that right.\"\n\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987).\n                     \n\n          The events here took place in late August and early\n\nSeptember  1990,  over  five months  after  Harper  issued in\n                                                  \n\nFebruary.  However, we do  not think the right established in\n\nHarper bears a  sufficient relationship to the  right alleged\n      \n\nhere.  That is, there  was no caselaw in August  or September\n\n1990 that  clearly established that a pretrial detainee had a\n\nright  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  procedures\n\nannounced  in Harper before  he could be  given antipsychotic\n                    \n\nmedicine in an emergency situation.\n\n          C.  Excessive Force\n                             \n\n          The standards  governing the use of excessive force\n\nare set out  in Whitley v. Albers,  475 U.S. 312 (1986).   To\n                                 \n\nshow an  Eighth Amendment  violation when  force is used,  an\n\ninmate   must  demonstrate   \"the   unnecessary  and   wanton\n\ninfliction of  pain.\"3  Id.  at 320.  This  inquiry, in turn,\n                           \n\ndepends on \"`whether force was applied in a good faith effort\n\nto  maintain  or   restore  discipline  or   maliciously  and\n\nsadistically for the very purpose  of causing harm.'\"  Id. at\n                                                          \n\n320-21  (quoting Johnson  v. Glick, 481  F.2d 1028,  1033 (2d\n                                  \n\nCir.), cert.  denied, 414  U.S. 1033  (1973)).   Finally, the\n                    \n\nCourt has  recognized that  deference should  be accorded  to\n\n                    \n\n3.  In cases  involving pretrial  detainees, the Due  Process\nClause applies.   Graham  v. Connor, 490  U.S. 386,  395 n.10\n                                   \n(1989).\n\n                             -5-\n\nprison  administrators in the  use of practices  and policies\n\nthat they believe  are necessary to maintain  the security of\n\nthe institutions they run.  Id. at 321-22.\n                               \n\n          To  be entitled to summary judgment, a moving party\n\nmust \"show that there is no  genuine issue as to any material\n\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.\"  Fed.  R. Civ. P. 56(c).  Once the movant has\n\nmet this  standard, the burden shifts to the non-moving party\n\nto establish  the existence  of \"at least  one issue  that is\n\nboth  `genuine' and `material.'\"  Kelly v. United States, 924\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 355,  357 (1st  Cir. 1991)  (citation omitted);  Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(e).   Here, plaintiff did not  file any affidavits\n\nor  other  record  evidence  in  opposition  to  the  summary\n\njudgment motion.\n\n          Turning to  defendants' evidence,  we do  not think\n\nthat  the record  is adequate  to  support summary  judgment.\n\nPlaintiff  alleges in  his complaint  that  he was  \"severely\n\nbeating [sic] by several of the  defendants which resulted in\n\na  separation [sic]  shoulder, lacerations  to  the face  and\n\nhead, bruises  to the chest,  arms and groin area,  caused by\n\nthe excessive use of force.\"   He also claims that defendants\n\ncaused  the  \"unnecessary  and wanton  infliction  of  pain.\"\n\nNext, plaintiff states that when he insisted on finishing his\n\nmeal, his  food tray was  grabbed and that the  jailer shoved\n\nhim; he  then  states that  he  was jumped  on and  his  arms\n\n                             -6-\n\ntwisted behind him.   Finally, he claims that  he was dragged\n\nto a cell while being kicked all over.\n\n          There are four disciplinary reports relating to the\n\nincident in  question.   The first  two describe  plaintiff's\n\nrefusal to return to his room after dinner.  According to the\n\nofficers, plaintiff  threw down  his spoon,  said he was  not\n\ngoing back  to his room and told the officers that they might\n\nas well take  him to \"the hole.\"   These officers immediately\n\nnotified the Sheriff's Emergency  Response Team (\"S.E.R.T.\").\n\nThere are  no  reports  from  any  members  of  the  S.E.R.T.\n\nconcerning precisely in what manner plaintiff was  restrained\n\nand how much force actually  was used to subdue plaintiff and\n\ntake him to a cell.  The only references to the  incident are\n\ncontained  in  the  reports  of  the  two  officers  who  had\n\noriginally  called the  S.E.R.T.    They  state  simply  that\n\nplaintiff \"was restrained and taken to the 6-1 unit.\"\n\n          In their  motion for  summary judgment,  defendants\n\nsimply assert that the officers  \"used no more force than was\n\nnecessary.\"   They cite,  in support of  this conclusion, the\n\nlog book  for August 31st;  the only relevant  information on\n\nthe page in  question simply states that at  5:25 p.m., \"Sert\n\nteam  called   to  move   inmate  Gaylon   Massey  to   6-1.\"\n\nSignificantly,  there are no affidavits from  any of the jail\n                            \n\npersonnel stating that  they did not use any  more force than\n\nthey reasonably believed necessary and that the force was not\n\n                             -7-\n\nexcessive, much less any affidavits describing what, in fact,\n\nactually happened.  \n\n          In  general, grants of summary judgment in cases of\n\nthis kind have  rested upon affidavits describing  the actual\n\nevent and refuting the suggestion of undue force.  See, e.g.,\n                                                            \n\nTarpley  v. Greene,  684 F.2d  1, 4  (D.C. Cir.  1982) (where\n                  \n\nplaintiff  filed a     1983  action  claiming  that  officers\n\nassaulted him during a  search of his home, summary  judgment\n\nappropriate  because   defendant  filed   an  \"uncontroverted\n\naffidavit\" denying assault took place).  Even if jail records\n\nwere treated as a substitute, the records here -- as noted --\n\nalso fail  to provide  such a description  of the  nature and\n\nextent of the  force used.   Thus, we  think that the  record\n\nfalls short of establishing that there is no material dispute\n\nabout the use of undue force and that a remand is required on\n\nthat claim.\n\n          In fairness  to the  able district  judge, we  note\n\nthat there is an affidavit supporting the view that plaintiff\n\nhad been guilty of disruptive behavior on two prior occasions\n\nin August 1990.  It is  a fair guess that, when the  officers\n\ndo file affidavits, they will not only assert the gist of the\n\ndisciplinary  reports relating to  August 31, 1990,  but will\n\nalso seek to show that they did not use excessive force.  The\n\nmedical records indicate  a sprained shoulder but there is no\n\nindication of laceration  or severe wounds.   Accordingly, we\n\n                             -8-\n\nexpress   no  view  on   whether  summary  judgment   may  be\n\nappropriate  if and when officer affidavits addressed to this\n\nincident are submitted. \n\n          The judgment of  the district court is  affirmed as\n                                                          \n\nto the  claims  of  deliberate  indifference  to  plaintiff's\n\nmedical  needs  and  the  involuntary  administration  of  an\n\nantipsychotic drug.  The judgment  is vacated as to the claim\n                                             \n\nthat defendants  used excessive  force in  removing plaintiff\n\nfrom the dining  area and the matter is  remanded for further\n                                                 \n\nproceedings.\n\n                             -9-\n",

The specific question the Court addressed was whether a judicial hearing is required before a state may treat a mentally-ill prisoner with antipsychotic drugs against his will.   Id. at 213.  The Court determined that the SOC's policies, which did not provide for such a hearing, were constitutional.

According to the officers, plaintiff threw down his spoon, said he was not going back to his room and told the officers that they might as well take him to \"the hole.\"  These officers immediately notified the Sheriff's Emergency Response Team (\"S.E.R.T.\").  There are no reports from any members of the S.E.R.T. concerning precisely in what manner plaintiff was restrained and how much force actually was used to subdue plaintiff and take him to a cell.  The only references to the incident are contained in the reports of the two officers who had originally called the S.E.R.T.

See, e.g., Tarpley v. Greene, 684 F.2d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (where plaintiff filed a Sec. 1983 action claiming that officers assaulted him during a search of his home, summary judgment appropriate because defendant filed an \"uncontroverted affidavit\" denying assault took place).  Even if jail records were treated as a substitute, the records here-as noted-also fail to provide such a description of the nature and extent of the force used.  Thus, we think that the record falls short of establishing that there is no material dispute about the use of undue force and that a remand is required on that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fairness to the able district judge, we note that there is an affidavit supporting the view that plaintiff had been guilty of disruptive behavior on two prior occasions in August 1990.  It is a fair guess that, when the officers do file affidavits, they will not only assert the gist of the disciplinary reports relating to August 31, 1990, but will also seek to show that they did not use excessive force.  The medical records indicate a sprained shoulder but there is no indication of laceration or severe wounds.  Accordingly, we express no view on whether summary judgment may be appropriate if and when officer affidavits addressed to this incident are submitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed as to the claims of deliberate indifference to plaintiff's medical needs and the involuntary administration of an antipsychotic drug.
